Most were over 20 minutes, about half were over 28 minutes).\r\n\r\nSo rather then focus all on the numbers I thought I&#039;d focus more or less specially on how this update feels.\r\n\r\nKnowing exactly what champs I wanted beforehand felt like a goal. Knowing the same thing right now makes me feel overwhelmed this is due to a number of factors. \r\n\r\n1. This lootbox idea stems from games like Overwatch, you level up, you get something. However even overwatch has an advantage, all heroes are unlocked from the start. LoL locks all champs away at the start and also only gives you stuff when you level up. It&#039;s the same system...but actually worse especially since we have like what, 110 more champs? And I can tell you right now, while I don&#039;t really play OW that much it does not take anywhere near the same amount of time to get 1000 coins for a skin then it does to get 6300 BE. I hate OW&#039;s system and I still think it&#039;s better.\r\n\r\n2. The loot drops are terrible, as is disenchanting. The one i opened had malphite, nunu, ryze, sivir, veige giving me a grand total of...729 BE. Making me short 20 blue essence of getting the champ I did  want, Rammus.(Mind you, this is RIGHT AFTER I had to level up to get Illaoi because I was short 8 BE) ***So now i have to play 15+ games just to get 200 blue essence. EVEN IF THIS NEW SYSTEM GAVE MORE (which is debatable) NOBODY, is going to feel like that was a fair result. Nobody is going to go &quot;Well, great I have to play 15 more games and play 6+ hours minimum just to get 20 essence! FUN!&quot;***  you are punished a bit more for actually purchasing champs with BE then with IP. If for instance I wanted a 6300 champ and a 3150 champ, if I had just a bit less then the amount of BE needed, say 9449 instead of 9450. You can&#039;t get both if you don&#039;t have enough for both. In the old system, you&#039;d just play bots or something, get the IP and buy both. But you can&#039;t play a match and get BE, you have to level up. This means people have to wait far longer then ever before to get new champs. Again, even if this new system gives out more, you&#039;re still working more and it&#039;s been proven you have to play more games to get equal results.\r\n\r\n3. Nobody is ever going to rely on RNG to get discounts on champ shards. This doesn&#039;t even make sense as an argument (and it&#039;s one riot employees brought up) because what champs you get is up  to RNG, why would you EVER rely on RNG to get you what you want? It can&#039;t even give you good amounts of BE, you expect it to give you the one champ you want out of 138 champs, with only a few chances every 6+ hours, that increases past every milestone? I expected at least ONE higher value champ yet I didn&#039;t get a single one worth more then 1350? And these milestone ones that supposedly give you more...um hello? RNG? The chances of me getting anything I want from them is entirely against me. I don&#039;t ever, at any point with this new system, feel that I am in control of anything. The thing about a grind, is that as long as people are given a clear path, even if they complain along the way, they do not feel lost, overwhelmed, or a sense of despair. I feel all three with this system. \r\n\r\n4. You are punished for holding on to shards. Let&#039;s say you get a champ shard you want to keep, but you want the new champ Zoe right? Well, if you don&#039;t disenchant it you are actively increasing the amount of time you have to play possibly by multiple factors. Let&#039;s say I get 1200 BE from a capsule. If I want to keep ekko from it, it&#039;s now worth only 900. Now imagine this happens every time you open a capsule. Let&#039;s say you spend the dozens of hours you need and finally get to 5200 BE...now you have to pray that the next capsule doesn&#039;t have champs you want and you have to pray that it gives you more then 1100 BE. None of which are guaranteed. In what sense is it a good idea to punish people like that for not disenchanting champ shards they want to actually keep??? Because if they get even 100 less BE they have to spend 15+ games leveling up AGAIN assuming they are in the lower levels.\r\n\r\n5. Which is another thing, I honestly feel punished for not winning more then ever. I&#039;m not a great player. I&#039;m still trying to remember what all those guides and youtube vidoes are saying. I&#039;m still practicing those last hit challenges. I&#039;m pretty sure I lose far more then I win. Because of that I miss out on a lot of EXP. And let me tell you, do the calculations, -50 exp from your average match, and say you lose 9 out of 15 matches. Now add that up for 3 levels. That&#039;s 1350 exp you are missing out on...or somewhere between 4-7 extra games (assuming they are all summoners rift). So for people like me who don&#039;t win a lot...that&#039;s going to add up especially since i dont have anywhere near  a 50% win  ratio. (GG says I have a 33% win ratio which is fairly typical I&#039;m told of new players). It&#039;s honestly a little crushing knowing that every loss means getting that FREAKING 20 BLUE ESSENCE I NEED will take even longer. \r\n\r\n6. Don&#039;t even get me started on us only having two rune pages and new ones costing....6300. The already punishing grind for newer players is made even worse by that. I&#039;ll just settle for always having the game start with incomplete rune pages because I have to change them every single time (ARAM, is hell for this) then setting back getting a new champ by dozens of hours. \r\n\r\n7. Yes I could buy it and when I feel the system is fairer. I&#039;m positive I will drop some money, but not a dime until then.\r\n\r\n8. I understand you are human. I understand you as a team worked hard. I don&#039;t know all the decisions behind this. I don&#039;t know if you plotted evil things to make people spend more money on RP by making this new system. I don&#039;t know if you just didn&#039;t think of everything. No I don&#039;t think the developers are all evil. yes I understand you have to balance profit/progress. Yes I am okay with a grind.\r\n\r\nBut at the end of the day. Even if the numbers you put out disprove what others have calculated. Even if the exact system we have right now actually is better. It doesn&#039;t feel that way. And in the end, that&#039;s what matters. Getting multiple shards of champs you already own (I already had Malphite, sivir, and veiger. It feels bad getting low value shards, it feels bad getting copies of champs I already own, it feels bad knowing that bad RNG made my grind that much harder). When opening loot was optional, it sucked getting duplicates but it wasn&#039;t that bad. Now that it&#039;s mandatory...well even Overwatch did away with duplicates for a reason.\r\n\r\nIt feels like getting the champs I want is a slog, not a fun challenge that will take a while because RNG, slow leveling, constant losses, and other issues drag down the journey. \r\n\r\nI can&#039;t even be happy when I get shards of champs I want because if I so much as dare keep them, I am escalating the challenge of getting to 6300 or 4800 BE. That&#039;s a terrible feeling to have. I want nautilus, if I get him, I&#039;m going to have to decide if I want the new champ Zoe or him more. If I decide the former, I lose his shard, if I chose the later I increase my grind and have to pray that RNG gives more high value champs I don&#039;t want to make up for it.\r\n\r\nAt every step I just feel lost and discouraged. Yes I&#039;m being blunt but I hope you understand this is how I feel, it&#039;s not meant to be an attack on you all but it&#039;s the only way I can get my disappointment at this system across. \r\n\r\nA few suggestions:\r\n\r\n1. As others have said, give BE alongside EXP for daily missions. Fixes the issue of not having extremely low amounts of BE like 20 BE.\r\n\r\n2. Possibly do multiple BE missions and EXP daily missions. This structure rewards the people who play a lot, doing away with one of the complaints that the system rewards people who barely play vs the people who play a lot. This also fixes the issue above of having to play 15 games or more to get 20 BE. The amounts do not have to be crazy. They could simply add up to the same daily IP we used to get, or even less. But something is better then nothing in alleviating certain issues. \r\n\r\n3. Make champion capsules always have a value of 1000 or increase the value of shards. Getting only low value shards is crushing. Getting however many capsules till you hit the &quot;milestone&quot; with nothing of value won&#039;t make the milestone feel any better when you again, end up with nothing that you want. Because their is literally zero guarantee your amazing milestone capsule that has much more value, will have ANY value to a specific individual even if you do get more BE from them. Getting a nocturne skin shard as a part of your milestone when you will NEVER play him is NOT REWARDING. Especially since you can only hit a milestone once and it gets harder and harder over time. Nobody is going to celebrate spending dozens of hours to get a capsule filled with champs/skins they will never use. And again, I KNOW you have to balance this with earning money. But there has got to be some kind of middle ground, heck, it doesn&#039;t even have to be middle ground, it can still be slanted in your favor, but this is NOT going to work out in my opinion. I am not in the least bit excited for this milestone award (ditto for champ capsules, zero excitement) because I know I&#039;m not going to get anything I want. That&#039;s how every single level is going to be, people not expecting anything they want but being forced to play harder for what they do want. RNG, sucks. It was more or less optional before this update, now it&#039;s mandatory and a part of everything. There has to be a middle ground somewhere.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Calad","date":"2017-11-11T03:59:46.302+0000","up_votes":110,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hi Crusina,\n\nThis is super thoughtful, well-articulated feedback that I'm going to share with the team.

The vast majority of players will be earning more blue essence in the new system than they did ip in the old system.

(\"oh, I need 20 IP for this champ I wanna try, I'll pop in a game of aram real quick to so I can buy it\" type of thing)\n\nBut with the new system, players could be making 20%+ for all we care and it won't matter because that progress, that agency is no longer present. You short 50 BE for something? Tough luck, you gotta play 6+ games until you level up to crack open that next lvl up box. And when each league game lasts 20-40 min, having to wait that many games for just a handful of dust is extremely frustrating. On top of the fact that when yer saving up for a large purchase, you don't have that steady progress to keep encouraging you, but rather you have large \"chunks\" of BE gifted to you instead at infrequent intervals\n\nI understand that this 'reward' system works for Blizzard with Overwatch, but League is not Overwatch. League's games are too long for that reward system to work for it.\n\nAlso, another thing. I never voiced my opinion on this when ya'll first rolled out loot boxes, but that was mainly because I was starting to drift away from league around the time you guys rolled them out, but I feel that it must be said now. And that is I am actually very disappointed in Riot for stooping to the level of incorporating _gambling_ mechanics that prey upon they same mental hooks that slot machines in casinos prey upon their \"players\" in order to turn a quick buck.\n\nNo, please, don't bother bringing up the \"free\" options that players are given for 'champ mastery' as they are a joke and blatantly inferior to their RP versions.\n\nI'll be honest, when League first started, I really respected you guys for being able to put out a high quality game without having to charge the players a dime to play and that all paid content was merely cosmetic. That was a bold move and it worked. But to see you sink to the same marketing 'trend' just to milk more money from vulnerable players... well, it saddens me. I want League to be great. I want Riot to be successful. But I wish it didn't have to be this way. I know Riot can be better than this. But I also know that nothing will change, because there are _FAR_ more casual players that don't care and will throw their money at the game regardless of what the passionate few think about it. It's a numbers game that has been proven time and again with other big name companies, and just the thought of it makes me sick to my stomach. The fact that this 'trend' will not go away and the fact that I have no power to change it fills me with an emptiness and despondency that I know not how to resolve.\n\nBut I have spoken enough for now. I don't know how to wrap this up, but I hope you read this, and, assuming you did, I thank you for your time, and I hope something can be done about it, but I understand that that is very unlikely.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Calad","date":"2017-11-11T17:01:38.887+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":6,"body":"The reason I think OP's post is really valuable is because it tackles the \"feel\" of the new system directly - rather than trying to talk about the math.

All I want is to get currency and use it to buy champions. Everything about the new system gets in between that.\n\nBefore all I had to do that was play games and I would directly gain IP. It was very easy math to see how much I was gaining, how far I had to go, and how many games that would approximately take me to reach a purchase point. I gain IP after each game, see my IP total tick up,  and it feels good.\n\nNow I don’t gain BE after each game. I gain XP. I work towards filling an XP bar to gain a level but I’m getting no positive feedback from the system along the way because XP and leveling are just arbitrary, limiting systems between gaining BE and buying champs. \n\nI don’t see how many games it’s going to take me because games don’t give me BE. Levels give shards which give BE, but I can’t tell how long a level will take because of losing streaks. Losing streaks didn’t feel as bad in the old system because the process to buy a champ was one big process and winning and losing would even out. Over the much shorter course of a level, streaks are felt far more acutely. Gaining XP doesn’t make a losing streak feel less bad because I have to convert XP through so many systems to get to how I’m progressing to buying champs. \n\nI don’t see how many levels I will need because I don’t know what my level up dice roll will be. I don’t know how long it’s going to take me to get my next champ. Nothing about any of this feels good. The mental math of converting XP into levels into dice roll shards into BE averages into games is not simple and clean and it can’t ever be simple and clean unless several of those steps are cut out.

I've been playing for 6 years, sometimes more sometimes less.  The game just keeps getting more and more complicated:\nTo keep things 'fresh', league used to come out with champions incessantly until the number of champions started to become a hindrance to someone trying to pick up the game. \n\nThen Riot started reworking champions (basically removing a champion to create a new one that's vaguely similar).  \n\nThen they started to completely change items--I still don't understand lethality (It's basically flat armor pen that scales based on level? Just show me an armor pen stat and in the item tip say it scales with level.  If I'm playing against it, I have no idea how much +20 lethality will penetrate my armor compared to the +18 mp sorc boots)\n\nAfter items came the loot boxes (which is nice, league is free to play and skins were the only thing you couldn't get, and now you can--through lucky RNG--get those too) which started adding more confusion.  It's not just a box that gives you a reward, it gives you part of a reward.  Part that needs to be combined with blue essence, or orange essence, and whatever gemstones are.  But the box has to be opened with keys, and you don't just get keys from games, but you get key shards which have to be combined into keys, to open the box to get a shard to use essence you got from destroying other shards to get the item/skin/champion you wanted.  Yes, it's incredible that playing a free game you can even get the skins now, but does it really need to involve SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS?\n\nNow they went and completely rehauled runes (which greatly needed it). Yes the reworked runes need a lot of work, but that's what pre-season is for.  It's nice insofar as it removing the necessity to buy rune pages and premake setups that sometimes only kind-of work for a champion, but it's just causing a lot of unbalanced issues. The game play became an absolute stomp-fest currently (especially in ARAM, with many champions doing insane amounts of damage, but typically from a relatively safe build path, thus making a glass cannon style build nearly impossible to even be effective anymore.)  But the removal of IP... it could have been a net-positive impact if they just combined blue essence and IP and kept all else equal, just removing one game currency).  But as Nefas was saying, now even getting rewarded for each game became more complicated.  It's not just play a game, gain IP (aka BE).  Now it's play a game to gain xp (aka grind).  It doesn't even matter if i gain upwards of 10% more overall, it's that I don't feel like I am earning anything.  To an average player before, it seemed like every game netted a random amount of IP, but it helped me towards my goal (with a healthy FWoTD bonus).  Now, I earn a random amount of XP which helps me towards a level, which in turn nets me a random amount of BE to help me towards my actual goal.  And it's not automatic. I have to leave queue, look at the overly complicated loot system to open some weird blue thing that I don't understand what it is and it just happens to award me with BE.  \n\nThe new client started out so clean.  Now I literally just have to randomly look around or just google anything I want to do in the client. (For instance when I logged in this week and got the notice for level 5 honor reward ward skin, I didn't know if it's something I get automatically, or it's a crate like getting my blue essence back was, or the other things--in case anyone is wondering, it's automatic, but you can't select ward skins until you're in champion select. Which is pretty weird since I have no way of seeing what ward skins I have currently aside --going to the store --selecting accessories --selecting ward skins --selecting show owned -- and scrolling through to look at things that say owned instead of the price, which doesn't show ones that were earned separately from purchased.(and as an aside for that being a reward, I earned my honor 100% from ARAM, yet earned a ward skin I can't even use in aram {{champion:32}} ))\n\nI think riot will figure out the balancing issues to make the gameplay back to where it was, but please please please work on simplifying things.  It's becoming this ugly monster that's making the game harder for new people to get into (now there's a learning curve on more than just the gameplay), and harder for someone who's been here for years to understand what the hell they're doing.\n\nTLDR; Simplify.","replies":[{"poster":"Yormaughm","date":"2017-11-12T10:15:51.733+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The point about how cluttered the client is is sooooo true.

League has turned into the United States from 1910 to 2017 with the new update - I'll explain how;\n\nBack then, Milk was 5 cents a gallon. There were less than 10,000,000 people who populated the US at that time.\n\nNow, it's $3.00 because demand has to be met for 300,000,000 Americans.\n\n\nThe same has happened to League. Because the old system only adhered to the savvy League veterans in the amounts of a dozen million per year, now they had to make a new system. A system that was going to be able to pay for all of the new servers they have to sustain, supporting a larger-than-ever, 100,000,000 player-per-month player base.\n\nNotice how some games are really laggy? It's high player traffic. But, I'm not at my point yet.\n\nThe point is that the old system was like Milk at 5 cents a gallon in 1910. League takes a long time to 100% complete; to get all the champs and to master them all to M7; but much longer now. There are more people demanding the experience of League, but Rito still only has the same amount of League to give to all. It still takes the same amount of time for League players to reach the end of the experience. \n\nSo what do they do if the theoretical supply of League doesn't meet the demand of the players? What do they do if the experience of League for each player won't meet privately-invested expectations? Look-\n\nChamps take longer to get:\nChampion Shards are now more rare:\nSkin Shards come out of Hextech chests more frequently now, Champion Shards more rare;\nBlue Essence as a whole more rare to acquire without levelling up;\n\nit's simple.\n\nThey dilute League. It's classic micro-economics.\n\nBy making champions harder to acquire, they have more new players spending longer playing the game in order to get basic commission from telecomm companies. The players that are playing free-of-charge, are still giving Rito small amounts of monies via commission. With a massive player base, it will add up, even if profit from each individual player is as small as .001 cents per player. The number is probably bigger than that.\n\nMeanwhile, there are veterans like us, who pay money for the new champs, money for skins, money for everything;\n(I'm no Season 1 vet, but I've been playing on-and-off and Ryze since Season 3),\nWhy do we do it?\n\nI'll tell you why;\n\n\n\nEver notice how some American celebrities spend their time playing Xbox just like middle-class Americans do?\n\nEven if wealth separates social classes, there is only one League. \n\nIn the Cryptocurrency world, whoever bought 300$ worth of BitShares on March 3rd, 2017, and sold all of them on June 10th, 2017? Has $900,000 dollars right now. And some people invested thousands at that time.\n\nIn the stock world, FRZT skyrocketed from .0010 to .0130 and whoever invested $1000 (me) made something like $10,000 profit off of three days of waiting.\n\nI know it seems like money is impossible to come by for those young'un's out there, but once you turn of-age to do intricate financial things and have the audacity to make erratic financial moves that could potential be a golden age for your bank account, you make the money to be able to pay for all those cool Rito toys like *that* (snaps fingers).\n\nMost of the player base is people who are middle-class or lower who try to get as much as they can for free, and they still have the system there for that.\n\nI'm right in the middle. I'm upper-middle class, I made 1000% on a stock-market only run in June (missed the bitshare boom ;.;)  and I bought only champions that are meta. Of course I'm not paying money for Tryndamere or Teemo since they are cheap, both money-speaking and gameplay-speaking. Banned a lot. I don't pay for Xayah or Rakan because each game of Summoners Rift is very circumstantial. I understand that buying expensive champs does not mean free wins, and I understand that enough to know not to waste money on out-of-meta expensive champions, like Aatrox.\n\nIn the end, it's all about whoever has the money to try it all out. Some people love the game so much that they'll pay for all the champs, whether they can financially afford it all or not. Some find it a social obligation to buy minimum-expense champs just to keep an edge, like Akali or Katarina. Some find it fun to Main Teemo or Tryn because they are cheap, and lmao cheap.\n\n\nCan you imagine if I'm one of those people playing league who invested like $10,000 in Bitshares in march for no reason, then sold it all for $10,000,000 in the summer?\n\nI'd buy every Aatrox Skin and hold a charity event livestream celebrating every death I get with Aatrox and each death I get as Aatrox, 500$ goes to the Jimmy Fund lmfao the Jimmy Fund would be VERY GRATEFUL","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kloqdq","date":"2017-11-10T16:18:00.417+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue is just them putting too much of the reward into single bursts.
