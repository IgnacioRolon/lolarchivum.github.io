Making turrets invincible so game doesnt end instantly.\r\nI am not using it for HP regen / No Cooldown / Infinite Mana etc etc.\r\n\r\nSo far I was able to Solo Baron without items with Zac, Shaco, Yorick, Mordekaiser.\r\n\r\nIf you have any other champion in mind that can solo baron without items.
