I have re-installed the game which seemed to help for about 2 days.  Every 2nd or 3rd game I get into I or someone else gets disconnected, and it is very hard to get reconnected in time.  I didn't have these issues on 6.15........ I also am getting very frustrated with que dodgers! why hasn't something been done about them.. maybe re work the que system so that your can't dodge if you don't like the make up.  Anyhow, I am getting to the point where i don't want to play anymore which is a shame because i managed to get to the point where I can look the other way on just about every hater in this game... Almost feels like my time is getting wasted now. :(","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-04T21:46:22.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you are having a combination of issues here, and I'd like to help.
