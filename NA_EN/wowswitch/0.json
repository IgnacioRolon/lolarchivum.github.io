I wanted to know what your guys thoughts were on the difference between an ADC and Marksman. So let me explain how this argument even started. After winning a game, I said \"Good game\" the usual thing a player says after a game. Then the other team says \"_**We did not even have an ADC**_.\" Which is where all hell broke lose when I said \"_**Yes you do, you had Master Yi**_\". I started this kind of as a smart ass remark, but it quickly turned into me trolling the guys with the truth. They would not accept my logic, which is that_** if you build ad items your an ADC**_. So I wanted to get the community's thoughts on** what makes an ADC an ADC.** My firm belief is that it lies within the player, not the champion._** If you build AD on Annie for instance is she not an ADC(And perhaps in this instance a marksman)? **_My point is at least in this instance is that it's a players choice what to build, and that the underlying factor in whether a champion is an adc(attack damage carry) is if a player builds ad on that champion. So in fact a player could play lets say Sivir fully tank, and she not be an adc, since she will not be supplying in that role, or build type. Anyway I just wanted to know your guy's thoughts after having a kind of funny conversation about this. They mostly argued the slang of the term ADC, which is almost explicitly referred to nowadays as bot lane marksman. I totally agree with what they were saying but they refused to acknowledge my argument. _**So do you guys agree or disagree that an ADC, is a players choice on build, or do you  disagree and think it is only a reference to champions who are marksman and play in the bot lane?**_","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-11-02T12:06:27.039+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lolwut\n\nNo, but for real, the term Attack Damage Carry is a holdover from Defense of the Ancients, and referred to, well, more or less what it does now. The AD Carries were the units that built up a massive amount of power over the course of the game, to the point where they carried the game on their backs alone.\n\nWhat riot did a while back was try to phase out the term in favor of \"marksman\" for reasons I can't be bothered to look up (clarity?). Ultimately, \"marksman\" and \"adc\" are largely interchangeable terms that mean the same thing.\n\nAlso Master Yi, Trin, Yas, and Fiora are all iterations on the idea of \"melee damage carry,\" each one done with varying degrees of success (or lack thereof). Thus, each of them is arguably a sort of adc, but since the term \"marksman\" does imply range, they fit into the old, less focused term, and not the newer one.","replies":[{"poster":"WoWswitch","date":"2015-11-02T12:16:20.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thanks! Your the first person to disagree and actually give me evidence I was wrong. I appreciate the reply and I would like to state that marksmen are most certainly ADC's, however I do not think they should be interchangeable by no means. This is due to the fact that marksman does not mean attack damage in all cases within league of legends environment. This is apparent with champs like teemo, azir. So marksman doesn't exactly mean Attack damage. It means 2 things one is that the damage is ranged(really obvious I guess) but more so that the damage is primarily(from auto attacks) This does not define as attack damage, as it could be full ability power that is scaling the attack (teemo, azir etc.).","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-11-02T12:29:46.092+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll meet you half-way on this one, if only because you actually brought up a good point. Champions like Azir and Teemo fall under the  term \"Ability Power Carry\" by dint of being AP champions filling a traditionally AD role. And while they _can_ be played as marksmen (please don't), that's not quite what they are. I won't concede that an ad carry/marksman is defined by their build, I'll concede that ADC=/=Marksman, but the terms **are** largely interchangeable, save for some outliers.\n\nPS, I just kind of assumed the whole autoattack thing was implicit so I didn't  bring it up in my previous post.\n\nEDIT: Corrected a typo (being AP champions filling a traditionally AP role) bleh","replies":[{"poster":"WoWswitch","date":"2015-11-02T12:35:16.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the constructive feed back!

Champs like kha'zix do most of their damage in a form of Attack damage should we not include them into our list of ADC's, as I mentioned before, an ADC is something that is built by the player not the champion. Do you agree with that statement?","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-11-02T12:53:57.804+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm, there's a grain of truth in that statement, but the thing is, assassins are different from ADCs in that the former relies on high burst damage while the latter relies on sustained damage. When the former works through their ability rotation, they can still autoattack, but theirs are rather lackluster, whereas the latter doesn't worry too much about having their abilities down.\n\nThat part is super obvious, yes, but what I mean is that their kits are so findamentally distinct that getting one to do the other's job is almost certainly going to fail.\n\nOne could build, say, talon with a lot of attack speed as well as AD, but much like trying to build AD Ziggs (weirdly legit), it doesn't really work. You can build a champion _like_ an AD carry, but if it falls really short of the intended goal, then it's hard to call them and adc.","replies":[{"poster":"WoWswitch","date":"2015-11-02T13:00:57.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Couldn't have said it better myself. So we'll define ADC's as role in which damage is done primarily over longer periods of time, but is consistent, while an AD assassin is not considered an ADC because it does it's damage a bit less consistently due to the design being to get in and out. However stepping back to what you just said, you could build say talon sustain ADC. As terrible as it sounds you could do it, reaffirming my point of player choice of ADC, over champion specialization.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-11-02T13:14:33.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm ok with the role of \"Whatever Damage Carry\" being defined by whether or not it actually works. But then it's not just player choice, then, is it? It's a combination of inherent numbers and mechanics on top of that.\n\nLike, you could build Runaan's, BorK, PD, Zerker boots, IE, and GA on Ryze, but it wouldn't work well because the raw values and abilities don't support the item build.\n\nIf it works, call it an ADC, but if it doesn't, pls don't build.","replies":[{"poster":"WoWswitch","date":"2015-11-02T13:21:05.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is true. There is on almost every champ a certain build that just won't be it's niche. That much is for sure. On Soraka for instance has no real benefit for building ADC. Even if she did, could you really call her an ADC? That question is completely subjective, because I could care less what someone calls it. However concerning actual melee champs, in which was sort of my main discussion, I'd like to close the argument in saying champs such as Tryndamere, Master Yi, and several other melee champs, do meet an ADC criteria, and that ADC does not explicitly always mean bot lane marksman. It would be a true statement to say Yi jungle is a kind of ADC jungle, because he looks to carry his team in attack damage.\n\nAnyway man, I'd like to take the time to thank you for being a good sport and replying in a constructive manner.

I totally agree. At first I considered all champions that used AD as their primary build to carry in damage, an ADC. However I think the role ADC is a carry that uses his fast attacks to quickly focus down enemies with his attacks and not his abilities. I'd argue that non conistant champions like Pantheon cannot be considered an ADC if they are build in a meta way due to the fact that he focus's all his damage on abilities, and in doing so has low attack damage. On the contrary I believe you could do an ADC build for him. Where his auto attacks matter more than his abilities. In doing so would be a really terrible build. So I still think you can build anybody in the game as an ADC. Meta build pantheon is ADC? I think not.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WoWswitch","date":"2015-11-02T12:43:23.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting point you bring up! I think this is very subjective. I would say that a tank is not an ADC, due to the fact it specializes in taking damage, not dealing damage. Either way though, could call a bruiser a tank and an ADC? I wouldn't argue that concept too much as I find that they do want to carry the game with attack damage, and be able to soak a bit of damage. After all most ADC's are conceptualized to have non-damage items such as boots, and sometimes a GA. The main argument for me was just to say a melee can also technically be an ADC though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WoWswitch","date":"2015-11-02T12:10:13.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the Thoughts!

This used to refer to many champs like Tryn, the old Olaf, Yi, and every Marksmen ever, but the melees soon had the 'carry' part removed because they either ended up having to go tanky to survive just to do damage or they stopped being played all together. We all knew our ADC's at bot were Ranged Attack Damage Carries, but considering all the melee ones were considered Pub Stompers, people only actually considered the ranged ones to be real carries. \n\nIn reality, Tryn, Yi, and Yasuo are technically ADCs just like Ezreal would be considered an AD Caster rather than a Carry since he doesn't build for AA's, but for the Q. This is why Riot coined the term 'Marksmen'. Very few champs are AP Marksmen, so it works for now until we get, like, laser beam AA'ing caster type. Like... Shooting out the turret laser kind of laser from a staff constantly as a form of AA'ing with AS affecting how quickly the damage is dealt. That would be an interesting AP Marksmen... but yeah. I'd say he can be considered an ADC, but the term 'ADC' has been so widely used for only the AD Marksmen in bot lane.","replies":[{"poster":"WoWswitch","date":"2015-11-02T12:27:10.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thanks for the Reply!
