First off, make sure you're running in Administrative mode! You can do this by:\n\n- Right-Clicking the League Launcher\n- Click Run as Administrator\n\nIf that does not function properly, make sure that your firewall isn't blocking the game from launching. [This Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#jwq2) will show you how to configure your firewall to work with League.\n\nAnd Finally, make sure you're not running any Third Party Programs (Like LolRecorder, Curse Voice etc.) as they can affect your patcher. If you are running them, please disable them and try to launch the game again!","replies":[{"poster":"jesus00nuts","date":"2014-12-11T00:01:27.427+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"what about mac users, a lot of us seem to be having problems with the lol launcher today as well.","replies":[{"poster":"elduris","date":"2014-12-11T00:34:56.794+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You can find the Mac instructions by scrolling to the top of the guide Digital Ram linked and clicking on the Mac button.","replies":[{"poster":"jesus00nuts","date":"2014-12-11T00:48:33.546+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Already have, I just said to hell with it and submitted a ticket, the guide didn't help me or the others with the same problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Orthodontist","date":"2014-12-11T01:06:18.328+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That is how I felt about the guides for windows :P","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CattCaller","date":"2014-12-11T06:49:21.338+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have tried this myself, and it still refuses to work. \nI have had a clean install of league since zac's release, no custom skin, no lolrecorder, no curse voice, razer comms, nothing extra.\n\nThe guide you have linked to has failed to resolve any issues since the start of this problem.
