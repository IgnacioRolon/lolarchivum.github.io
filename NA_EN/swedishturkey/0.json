I can't even go top lane I get 16 frames from me just standing with minions and enemy (Riven vs. Garen both default skins we both literally don't have any flashy things). All my settings are on very low, eye candy off,  champion inkling is off, client closed during the games, low specs mode on, and all sound is off.  I even ran my malware software to clean my PC it just doesn't work. Before the new client I had good enough frames, then after the  7.12 patch had Frames like around 50-60 it came back  (not much but it's smooth for me)  the next patches the frames in lane dropped each patch by around 10 each. Do I just quit or what  I do not know what to do here.","replies":[{"poster":"TheViper7911","date":"2017-07-13T18:49:32.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Computer make model and specs please?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-13T18:19:57.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regardless of settings, there could still be a few factors causing your frames to drop.
