Sylas will trump them all, many times over.\n\nOver 140 ultimates, ON ONE CHAMP. How do you possibly balance that? \nSome of these ults will be incredibly powerful on top of the rest of his overloaded kit.\n\nEarlier I seen a barely fed Sylas one shot 3 people in one go, with a full ap Malphite ult comboed with his own insane burst.\nNow the point i’m trying to make, is the difference between a Malphite ult and Sylas using a Malphite ult, is that Malphite doesn’t have anywhere near as much follow up damage/burst to follow it up with so he generally doesn’t one shot people unless he’s really ahead. This doesn’t apply to Sylas, he can use Malphite ult with plenty of follow up burst, basically breaking the fundamental rules of Malphite’s kit, a champ with barely any follow up burst outside his ult, because his ult is so damn powerful.\n\nSylas throws that rule out the window, and he will do that with many many other champion’s ultimates.\n\nNot to mention his ult cooldown is 9 seconds at rank 3!! and the rest of his kit is so damn overloaded, he is extremely mobile, with two dashes, has INSANE healing/shielding, an execute, and incredible amounts of aoe/burst","replies":[{"poster":"JackMcSnipeyz","date":"2019-01-10T00:55:16.501+0000","up_votes":50,"down_votes":1,"body":"How do you take into consideration the power budget of his ult, when he can literally use any ult.\nMalph ult is strong as shit but at the cost of his kit, cho'gath ult is strong AF but he is immobile.\nSylas has a normal kit but he can take any ult without considering his other abilities at all, and not even on a short CD aswell.\n\nGl balance team","replies":[{"poster":"GFREEMEN","date":"2019-01-10T01:25:28.611+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cho's Ult on Sylus is crazy\n\nI did a game with 13 stacks.

Explaining Rubick is he had an Ultimate that could steal any spell (not just ultimates); but he only could steal the last ability that the enemy character used.\n\nSo when Rubick stole something like a Tidehunter Ultimate (A massive fast AOE stun, think Amumu but way deadlier), he had to carefully plan it, first of all to be outside of the range of that ultimate, second to actually use his spell steal before Tidehunter could spam a different ability to prevent his Ultimate from being stolen. Third to pull off an ability that put him in harms way (Rubick is very squishy)\n\nSo when Rubick could steal Ultimates, a lot of the time this was a big play. It was a game-charger and game winner, some of Dota's most iconic moments involve clutch spell-steals. A good Rubick is rewarded for their clever usage of the ability and can turn the tides very suddenly.\n\nWith Sylas however, I'm seeing none of that. Sylas will simply choose which Ultimate he wants at little cost. He is encouraged to build tanky and has CC and sustain built into his kit. I know League is a very different game from dota now, but at its heart they are both games about strategy and outplay. Where's the outplay potential with Sylas?\n\nMassive missed opprotunity here.

Stealing pyroclasm seems amazing at a glance....then you remember Sylas doesn't have Brand's passive, which means his pryoclasm is quite a bit less scary than Brands because there's little threat of multiple ignite detonations (Relying on one person being hit three times). It's true of many ults like Syndra, Lux, Darius and more. There are also other ults that get woefully more powerful because of an enemy's kit.

It is not just numbers representing around 50% winrate, it is more the fact that there are available counters to the said champions at every stage of the game. \n\nSo if Sylas being good or bad is dependent on the enemy team composition, he is either going to be really unbearable or vice versa (though since he has the option of stealing between 5 ults per game, plus there being a CD on stealing the same ult), i do think that the times where he will be useless will indeed be very rare, since he is given that flexibility. Unless you actually expect the whole enemy team to choose champs with ults that do not work well with Sylas since their ults rely on other parts of their kit i.e. passives (brand as you said), then i could understand. However, i would expect such an unexpected scenario in pro play and this then takes us back to league ONLY catering to flashy pro plays. Do note, i am not against league trying to gain popularity/profit but at what expense?\n\nI do think that some ults will absolutely be a nightmare on him, regardless of if he was fed or not. The only way to balance him IMO, would be to make the rest of his kit weaker so that he is pretty reliant on being chosen against team comps with good ults that compliment his kit. With his current overloaded kit, i can't see a situation where sylas will be bad.\n\n It is the same strategy of overbuffing new champs so they are bought in masses  that we have been seeing for years.

If he could access every ult in every game, that would at least be consistent, but he'll have matches where his ult is almost useless, matches where it's ridiculously OP, and everything in between. It's too unpredictable to actually balance (meaning, neither OP nor UP).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sphinxthelion7","date":"2019-01-11T10:25:43.427+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is no way they will EVER balance this champ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"realDRdeal","date":"2019-01-10T19:52:11.068+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The easiest way I can think of to balance him is to make the CD on his ult be based of the CD of the ult he stole. For example, if he steals karthus ult, his ult goes on CD for the same base CD as karthus's ult does (applying whatever CDR Sylas has to the base CD of the ult of course). That way if he uses a high power ult that normally is not abusable because of it's long CD, Sylas also gets gated by that CD. Now the coding for that is probably not nearly as simple as I think it is, but that is a problem for someone who actually gets paid to do coding/programming.\nThe rest of the balancing can be achieved by first waiting to see how Sylas shakes out power wise once people have had some time to learn how to play as, with, and against him then adjusting the base damages and scalings on his basic abilities as needed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VelvetCrotch","date":"2019-01-10T03:32:24.607+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Akali>Sylas>Irelia imo. but hey just reduce their movement speed by 5.","replies":[]},{"poster":"the shy top","date":"2019-01-10T01:28:29.769+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cant ban vayne and sylas at the same time. \n\nThink this is the last straw. \n\nPeace","replies":[]}]}
