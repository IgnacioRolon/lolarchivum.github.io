However, having said that, losing to teemo shrooms in Aram is one of the worst feelings I can have in league. I'm sure there's a lot of people who agree with me on that one. It's just cancer to play against and a good teemo versus an enemy team that doesn't know what oracle's is will win at a very high percentage. Even with oracle's, I've seen good teemos top damage charts over and over and bad ones do like second or third most. Shaco is not as cancerous to play against (for me), but he's still a really strong champion in any case also at the high end of the damage charts. There's plenty of champs that don't do well in aram compared to those two. In fact, if anything I think most people want teemo to be nerfed more. \n\nLissandra I'm not going to comment on because I don't know when you wrote this comment.

I actually would agree his win rate should be even lower than what it is right now, but taking in the fact that it was historically a lot lower for a super long period of time, I'm willing to let yasuo players enjoy the game a little. I understand you might not share my feeling, but I would encourage you to try normal draft instead of blind. I used to hate normal draft, but riot has done a good job of updating it and I actually like it better than blind now. Just realized I assumed you were doing blind.

Originally it was supposed to be a voxel engine game, but a little thing called Quake 1 happened that completely rewrote the gaming landscape and how we made games.  Suddenly, they were reconsidering what engine the game should be made in and it took them 4 years to replace it.  When the game was finally released it, it played like a game that would have been good in 1996 not 1999.  That is what killed C&C.  Red Alert did well for itself as a franchise and Generals did OK as well.  But Westwood had to sell off to EA in 1998 because they failed to release C&C 2 and we all know what that means.
