And they've only buffed him since release.\n\nHe punches above other 3 cost units, but given you have options like Gangplank, Evelynn, and Rengar punching above their weight too Kennen has competition for who's the best in that tier.  But given a 3 cost is doing what Cho/Sejuani do while being a solo synergy, he's really, really good.","replies":[{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-09-05T14:15:34.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TwitchInMyPants,realm=NA,application-id=RaE1aOE7,discussion-id=rPAOuzjy,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-09-05T12:30:49.914+0000)\n>\n>And they've only buffed him since release.\n> \n\nPatch 9.15 says:\n\n\"Kennen Ability Damage: 400/650/900 â‡’ 225/450/675\"\n\nI'd say that's a pretty sizeable nerf.","replies":[{"poster":"TwitchInMyPants","date":"2019-09-05T15:24:44.621+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Missed that one lol\n\nBut yeah given the Ninja buff giving AP that compensates and they've done all kinds of attack and AI buffs and he's still very relevant in the meta.
