I joined Riot a few months ago as the North American Player Relations Manager.\r\n\r\nThe NA Players Relations team has recently been taking a wide look at what makes the NA League Community a great experience, and the NA Boards obviously figure pretty heavily in that picture. During a previous conversation, I mentioned that we&rsquo;d completed a day-long workshop discussing both the current state of the NA boards and our long-term goals for them. Today, I&rsquo;d like to take some time to review the results of this meeting, talk about direction and &ldquo;blue sky,&rdquo; and open the discussion up to your thoughts. Essentially, I&rsquo;d like to get your take on our take and hear your ideas on our ideas of how to level up our collective experience as the Boards community.\r\n\r\n_**DISCLAIMER: This isn&rsquo;t going to be a short post. That said, if you plan on taking part in the discussion, do me a solid and read it in its entirety. Thanks :)!**_\r\n\r\n**What&rsquo;s the point?**\r\n \r\nhttp://cdn.meme.am/instances/60498521.jpg\r\n\r\nWe want to make the NA Boards a more constructive and useful place for players to connect with each other and Rioters. Now, this is a pretty vague and ubiquitous statement, so we spent some time trying to identify questions we wanted to answer, from a Rioter point of view:\r\n\r\n* What makes the North American Boards the North American Boards?\r\n* What are our goals when it comes to moderation?\r\n* How can we make Player-to-Rioter (and vice versa) engagement a better experience for both parties?\r\n* What do we think players need and want from the Boards? (something we obviously want your thoughts on as well).\r\n* What do the Boards look like in an &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; state?\r\n\r\nThese questions obviously sparked a lot of conversation, and eventually led to a sort of overarching debate: What exactly is the &ldquo;point&rdquo; of the NA Boards, or rather, what do they offer that other League communities don&rsquo;t?  While this might seem an odd question (who cares, it&rsquo;s got dank memes), it&rsquo;s actually an important one to consider. The online League ecosystem is pretty robust at this point (which we love!). That being said, we don&rsquo;t want a community forum that&rsquo;s just kind of there because we&rsquo;re supposed to have one. So again, what specifically should the Boards offer?\r\n\r\n**What do the North American Boards look like now?**\r\n\r\n*/em takes a deep breath&hellip;*\r\n\r\nSeems like a pretty loaded topic, right? Well, it can be, and we had a very real conversation about the current state of the Boards.\r\n\r\nhttp://cdn.meme.am/instances/43981225.jpg\r\n\r\nThe point of sharing this assessment (and asking for your thoughts) isn&rsquo;t to dwell on where we&rsquo;ve been, but rather to focus on what we can accomplish, together, moving forward.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this conversation we tried to identify some of the key areas of potential improvement for the NA Boards (presented below in no particular order):\r\n\r\n* The Boards feel fractured-there&rsquo;re too many of them, they don&rsquo;t fit together as well as they could, and too often they&rsquo;re lacking clear identities.\r\n* The amount of &ldquo;RITO PLZ&rdquo; can sometimes smother other interesting conversations. Since these posts often tend to stick out, Rioters then frequently respond to them, and the behavior is reinforced and perpetuated.\r\n* Toxicity. We all know that, at times, the front page can appear to be dominated by angry posts (in other news, the Pope is Catholic, the sky is blue and I&rsquo;m an overweight Asian man). In all seriousness, the ways in which we express our frustrations can have a profound impact on how we all interact with each other.   \r\n* The Boards&rsquo; current format doesn&rsquo;t always make it the easiest place to actually engage in long-lived and fulfilling conversations; in a broader sense, the UX (user experience) of the Boards could use some improvement. Which contributes to&hellip;\r\n* The Boards don&rsquo;t feel like a &ldquo;sticky&rdquo; experience. As it currently stands, there aren&rsquo;t a lot of reasons for players to visit the boards multiple times per day.\r\n* There&rsquo;s lots of room for improvement in how we surface Rioter interactions. _For example, I personally like the way Blizzard surfaces blue posts on the front page of their individual game fora._\r\n* The boards need to be optimized for mobile. End of story. You should be able to read the boards while attending to important business&hellip;in the bathroom.  \r\n* Players should be able to feel a sense of community ownership over the Boards.\r\n* We&rsquo;re lacking in social features.\r\n* Moderation can be leveled up.\r\n\r\n_**This list isn&rsquo;t exhaustive**_ - it&rsquo;s focused on the most obvious problems as we see them, and you guys doubtless have insight to provide on other things that need be on the to-do list. \r\n\r\nWhat do the NA Boards look like ideally?\r\n\r\nBefore we dig into this, let&rsquo;s all acknowledge one inalienable factoid: **ideal is an entirely subjective term.** Everyone has their own idea of what the Boards should look like. Chances are you have some great ideas for quality of life upgrades addressing pain points with which you have personal experience.\r\n\r\nAs you read our musings below, remember these are ideals and goals we want to aim towards, not a promise of features / changes to come.\r\n \r\n* We want the Boards to feel active, with fresh content each time you visit. This should be tempered with reason, but if you view the Boards once in the morning and once in the evening, you should see somewhat fresh topics each time.\r\n* You should be able to expect regular, consistent content from us aimed specifically at the Boards Community. We&rsquo;ve already kicked this off with the new [&ldquo;Meanwhile in Top Lane&hellip;&rdquo;](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/FNU5qiow-june-4-meanwhile-in-top-lane) feature, but there are more in the works. \r\n* Should we create a RITO PLZ specific board? There are some great examples of player communities where requests / ideas specifically directed at developers are focused in a single forum _(Capcom tends to do this, especially with their fighting games)._\r\n* Visible Moderation:  Building trust and transparency within the community through open conversation about how the boards are managed is important (and part of why we&rsquo;ve made this post). We&rsquo;re going to have some focused discussion around the topic of Visible Moderation (what is it, what does it mean), so please stay tuned for that in a future post.\r\n* We want the Boards to be a customizable, social experience. Ideas like showing what your friends are upvoting, the ability to subscribe to different players posts, etc were all thrown around. Basically, we&rsquo;d like more opportunities for players to connect to each other on Boards as readily as you can connect to Rioters.\r\n* Explore how to better support the global element of NA Boards communication from Rioters. There&rsquo;s a ton of communication that happens here on the North American Boards that&rsquo;s applicable to anyone who plays League. Most of us here in the Los Angeles offices are North American players, so naturally we gravitate towards the platform that we consider &ldquo;home.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s nothing inherently wrong with this, but it does contribute to our friends in other regions sometimes asking &ldquo;where&rsquo;s the love?&rdquo; This idea is even more exploratory than those above, and we&rsquo;d want to accomplish any changes without creating yet another community channel for players to keep track of, so if you have thoughts, please share them.\r\n\r\nThat&rsquo;s alot of stuff to cover, and we plan to have follow-up discussions about these topics in the weeks to come, which leads to the obvious question...\r\n\r\n**What about all the other things we need to talk about?**\r\n\r\nWell, that&rsquo;s part of why we&rsquo;re here - we want your input and thoughts before we define exactly what comes next. You should certainly weigh in here, but as I mentioned we&rsquo;re also planning some focused discussion in the coming weeks around the following topics:\r\n\r\n* Boards Organization\r\n* Visible Moderation\r\n* Revisiting the Universal Rules\r\n* Ongoing Boards Dev\r\n \r\nThis is the start of a collaborative process, one in which your voice and feedback is an important piece of the puzzle.\r\n\r\nFor today, some Rioters are on hand to answer your questions and thoughts for the next few hours. Joining the conversation will be:\r\n\r\n* ADillonMostDirty\r\n* d&rsquo;Artagnan\r\n* RiotZwill\r\n\r\nLet&rsquo;s get started!","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-06-05T19:59:56.045+0000","up_votes":49,"down_votes":0,"body":"# Visible Moderation \n\nThe biggest problem with moderation is that the only way I notice it is when someone starts their post \"My original post got deleted by mods because X\". That is, as far as I've been able to observer, all the moderation that happens on these boards - a thread is deleted. Moderation that, if necessary, edited posts and had the moderators post why that post needed to be changed, would do a better job of being visible and serving as a reminder.\n\n#What I want out of the Boards \n(beyond a mobile site *with a way to select desktop mode*) \nI think the biggest things relate to previewing content of interest.\n\n* I want to **be able to exclude Boards from showing up on Board Home**. I set my preferences to \"Show me content from every Board except XYZ\", and never have to see content from boards that I know don't interest me. *I want this feature because I'm generally interested in the rest of the Boards*, but those individual ones fill up too much of my limited first page view with stuff that I don't care about.\n\n* I ***NEED*** a **paging system** for the Boards Home. The current system is such that if a topic doesn't show up before I get to the \"Show More\" button, it's not worth reading. A paging system ensures that I don't have to click the \"Show More\" button 5 more times after I click into a topic, then hit the back button in my browser, giving these other topics a chance.\n\n* I'd like to see more attention put into **mouse-over previews of posts**. There's nothing like trying to guess who \\{{champion:22}} is and if you want to talk about them, seeing &\\#039; over and over again in a preview, or seeing an official Riot post that has a preview that's almost entirely new lines. \n\n* Related to previewing threads, **being able to assign an icon to the thread** (champion portraits, summoner spells, items, the class symbols, the rank icons) could make it easier to skim. If I'm tired of Ekko QQ, then I could safely skip any threads with an {{champion:245}}  icon. If I'm really interested in knowing more about Yorick, then the {{champion:83}} icon will grab my attention more.\n\n* **Ability to dismiss threads**. I don't need to re-visit a thread titled \"You don't belong in Gameplay and Balance unless you're in Diamond\". The OP will make their points (or demonstrate their inability to) on the first pass, at which point I don't need to see it continually bobbing up to the top of the Recent sorting because someone wants to argue with what's likely a troll post.\n\n* **Consolidated Red Tracker**. I don't need to see every post by a Rioter, I need to see *threads* Rioter's are engaged in, and when those update. The current Red Tracker is useless because of the extreme amount of spam that it generates trying to follow every single post.\n\n# Social\n\nAt this point, there are a few names that when I see them come up in a thread I pay attention to what they have to say. Sometimes it's for Humor (*Laughing Fish*), sometimes it's for a great way to relate to Lore (*CupcakeTrap*), and other times it's just because we seem to have Similar Views more often than not (*Valkyrie Witch*). I hesitate to say that there should be some sort of \"friend\" or \"follow\" feature, but it could be nice to have some way to make these players stand out a little more from the crowd when I'm skimming comments.","replies":[{"poster":"A Small Man","date":"2015-06-05T21:42:37.639+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is some seriously awesome feedback, especially around UX (though your ideas on Social and Moderation are also right in line with our thoughts).

It´s nice to have Rioters chim in every now and than, but if you take intel from the forums that actuallyimpact your decissions than it would feel great for the community if you openly talk about that a little more specific. Not sure on that \"riotplz!\"-board...i guess that could end up in getting overwhelmed by very unspecific things that would be hard to find the right person to look at it in the first place.\n\n  -  What do we think players need and want from the Boards? (something we obviously want your thoughts on as well).\n\na place to talk about league as a community aswell as a place to have contact to the developers would be the obvious answer to that i guess. I think the first step to achieve both actually would be to realy stack up on moderation and make Riots participation in the Forums visible apart from some few posts. \n\nAlso, why do you still use reddit for real important stuff like the current TTT-changes? For the love of god, you´re turning your back on your own creation there and then expect everyone else ot just favour these boards? not gonna happen. \n\nLastly, long and in-depth discussions are sometimes unavoidable and important - and they don´t get supported by these boards in the slightest. It´s just painfull to read a longer discussion that just stacks boxes over boxes under boxes beneath boxes...basically leaving the conclussions of longer discussions totally invisbile. \n\n\n  -  What do the Boards look like in an “ideal” state?\n\nreally hard to say, but i guess I still fondly remember the Blizzard Boards in these regards...lots of Theoriecrafting broken down for everyone by the community, lots of moderation, very visible \"blue posts\"...i think that would make a good start.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-06-05T18:45:27.162+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"It would be nice if they at least linked to stuff on reddit and such for people who don't use or frequent those sites","replies":[{"poster":"Zwill","date":"2015-06-05T18:53:20.357+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Have you seen [Meanwhile in Top Lane? ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/FNU5qiow-june-4-meanwhile-in-top-lane)","replies":[{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-06-05T19:33:48.972+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"It should be auto done though.

Sorry for the wall of text in advance.\n\n#Visible Moderation\n\nBeing a moderator, i am not the biggest fan of visible moderation, because I don't see many upsides. One reason why I don't like visible moderation is that it opens the gates for witchhunting. 90% of the moderation I do is about unintentional violations of the rules (especially naming & shaming) or insults by people who are extremely frustrated temporarily. I see no upside in shaming these people publically. Remove the thread, maybe give them a little timeout to calm down and thats it. From my experience this works just fine. People who name & shame learn that they are not allowed to do that, people who flame have time to cool down and rarely come back to flame again. \nOnly a small minority doesn't react to this \"soft moderation\"...and I highly doubt that shaming them publically would do any good (some trolls would probably like the additional attention they get). \nThe only upsides of visible moderation is that people see that something is done. But do we really need that? From my experience most moderators are fine with supporting the community behind the curtains without anyone really noticing. \nI undestand DrCyanides argument about visible moderation serving as a reminder, but I don't think it's worth it. Most people who violate the rules visit the boards for the first time, there is no chance to educate them before they start violating the rules. They enter the boards and just write their thread. Again, naming & shaming is a good example for this. In the european boards we had a big sticky thread reminding people about this rule, but it didn't help at all. Why? Because the first thing new board users do is writing their thread, not reading any other threads. That's why i doubt that visible moderation as a reminder has a very big effect. \n\n#Highlighting aweseome users\n\nI think this is something that is extremely important. I have been active on the boards for 4 years now and I have met the most aweseome players here. Players who help other players on a daily basis, players who patiently discuss and explain the same topics (vote kick, prisoner island, Kata is OP, etc.) every day, players who help other players to deal with toxicity and frustration, players who help other players to improve their own behavior, players who answer questions for new players, players who stay constructive and friendly even if the get insulted by players who visit the boards to rant....to sum it up: The pillars of this community. \nIn my opinion these players do not get the recognition they deserve. Pro gamers are visible on stage, Youtubers get spotlights, honorable players ingame get badges ([it's something](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/playstationallstarsbattleroyale/images/5/5f/Its_something.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130808214344) .) .... but no one notices the silent army of awesome people who help other players on the boards. \n\nThis really needs to change. As Emissary, I tried to do that in germany, but it's not really possible. Even as a moderator you don't have the tools to identify positive forces on the boards. Sure, you can look up someones post count and you can look up peoples up- and downvotes on individual posts...but thats it. \nI want to know who the most active user on the new-player-boards is. I want to know who writes the best explanations about player behavior features. I want to know whose presence in a thread is helpful to create a constructive discussion. \n\nRiot does a lot to support positive behavior...but I have the feeling that the boards have been forgotten in this aspect. So what i really would like to see:\n\nDo some research on the boards, make it possible to identify positive players and make sure they get the recognition they deserve. \n\n#Global communication\n\nA lot of board users in europe (and probably even more in other regions) feel like second class players. The last redpost on the german boards was 9 days ago and if you forget about announcements and stickies, the general amount of redposts reduces to almost zero. If you have a discussion on the german boards, you can be sure that it will have no consequences at all. No developer will ever see or comment it, every idea is wasted, every criticism ignored. This doesn't really encourage people to discuss anything on the boards. This is really not good at all. \nI don't blame the local Rioters, it's not their fault. Most of them simply CAN'T comment on these discussions because it's not their area of expertise or they simply don't have the time to browse the boards. \nOf course the problems for NA Rioters are obvious: You don't speak the languages, you live in another time zone, you don't have the time to browse a dozen boards, looking for that one cool thread you want to comment on. \n\nBut there is a group of people who does speak the language, does live in the timezone, has the time to browse the local board and additionally knows which threads are good/important and which are not: The pillars of the community i mentioned before, the silent army of regular (positive) board users...including the volunteers. \nI know that NA does not really have a lot of volunteers, mainly because you don't need them. You have an army of Rioters. \nBut if you are looking for a way to find posts that are worth being commented on, if you need a filter that sorts out spam, if you need a translator for those strange languages...you already have that. And the best part is: It's the community! You don't have to develop anything, you don't have to hire anyone, you don't have to train anyone. You just need to invest a little time to communicate with us, that's all. We are ready.\n\nGreetings, \nyour Volunteers!\nhttp://d.thumbs.redditmedia.com/VB0FMjZ5P4qMQ8jK.jpg\nhttp://imgur.com/wIhoxTy\nhttp://imgur.com/sA417ov\n\n___\nedit: This post is not as long as I expected it to become, because it decided it's smarter to send you our feedback from a moderators perspective (moderator features) on another channel.

If you actually take a look at things around here, you know my name I hope. ... I mean there's that thread with what, 2k upvotes? About moderation that's been here since Boards Beta, \n\nSo why am I posting on this account? It's a friend's smurf... Because my main got -1 week banned- for calling a friend of mine a \"cracker\". ... Look I get that word is similar to the n word in what it goes back to, but the difference is one of those words is censored in every day life, the other isn't -because no white guy ever takes offense to it, myself included-. It was seriously just a joke. \n\nOkay! So let's talk about the actual state of things:\n\nI'm going to be blunt. I know there's 3rd party mods. I know they aren't actually dislocated from the playerbase because one accidentally posted on the old forums before immediately removing it, and he had a Riot tag. I know those mods are the same as now-- or at least the same company. I also know they were a lot less strict until certain things I shouldn't mention publicly happened. So let's get that bullshit out of the way. \n\nMoving forward, I really don't care about any of that so long as it does not affect the community's experience. Except it has. You want an example, I got 1 week banned from a community I -love- to talk with and now cannot, because \"cracker\". Fucking really? The \"don't be a jerk\" rule is being enforced way too damn hard. \n\nContext needs to be understood, -period-. If I say \"Lol fuck you\", that's probably a joke, hence the \"lol\". That's not me being a jerk. Friends tell each other that all the time. There are times that phrase -can- be offensive and warrant a warning, but only in a heated argument, so unless that's going on, probably don't warn for it. \n\nI got one day banned once for saying \"brb killing self\". It was -very- obviously a joke about something that happened in game. This phrase comes up all the time as a joke, and it's not an actual threat, so don't punish people for that. If you -really- think that content isn't acceptable here, just remove it and warn, there's really no reason to ban someone for that-- and don't warn/ban it for a \"threat\", do it for inappropriate content. It's not a threat. \n\nAnd for fuck's sakes stop punishing people for risque pictures that -don't actually show anything or aren't over the top depicting things-. I -do- get that this is  grey area that cannot be defined, and I do get that people cannot go over the top with this. I understand, I get it. No one needs to be getting in trouble going to these forums at school or work and seeing it. So let me better explain I guess. Would Google Safe Search allow it? -Would this be allowed in your own game-? Then let it on. \n\nHere are some pictures from your game to better explain:\n\nhttp://2.bp.blogspot.com/-unJtLgp0k8M/TtK_0MtQtpI/AAAAAAAAAng/-fxo0_vZvwg/s320/jann2.jpg\n\nhttp://www.leaguesplash.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ChineseEvelynn-690x388.jpg\n\nSo I think those should be the standard, -because these were in your own god damned game-.\n\nThis is a -teen rated game-. Forums are technically unrated, which usually means \"anything not requiring 18 or older legally\", but it comes down to \"unless it doesn't break your guys' standards\". Well, those are your standards. Here's another example. Have you -seen- just how much Arcade MF's tits swing around in game? Take a look sometime if you haven't. They bounce around like crazy.\n\nThis game is sexual, face it. Nidalee has a \"cougar\" passive. Ahri is a succubus. Eve might as well be a BDSM character. \n\nWhen you come onto a forum for a Teen rated game, there is an expectation that there may be some teen rated content that is sexual in nature. That does not mean overly exposing, that does not mean something I could get fired for seeing or suspended at school for seeing. There is a line that should not be crossed, I get it. \n\nMoving on...\n\nBefore Tamat left (gee, I wonder why he left, hmmmmmm...), things were fucking fine on GD/General Discussion. Seriously. Mods occasionally screwed up but mostly it was okay. Now things are getting way out of hand. Holy crap I'm -literally afraid to even come here anymore-. I'm -afraid-. I'm afraid that one day I might say \"Yeah your mom would do that\" or something along those lines, and suddenly, \"Welp sorry bud but that implies dirty things so you're banned, have fun and get rekt. Sincerely, mods.\" I'm not even kidding, things are getting that fucking strict around here. \n\n\"Brb ki--ing self\" shouldn't be bannable. \"Yeah fuck you too m8 <3\" shouldn't be \"removed for being a jerk\". Etc.\n\nSo just tell your mods to calm the fuck down, jesus christ. \n\n... Thank you for reading, thank you for your time, thank you for listening. I really do love Riot. I love this community. I love coming here. I love this game. \n\nI don't want it ruined because the state of moderation is piss fucking poor at the moment. \n\nThanks.\n\n~Best Furry NA","replies":[{"poster":"Zwill","date":"2015-06-08T16:25:53.067+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":5,"body":"> When you come onto a forum for a Teen rated game, there is an expectation that there may be some teen rated content that is sexual in nature.

I joined Riot a few months ago as the North American Player Relations Manager.\n\nNice to meet you again! A while ago we spoke in an old thread you made about the state of the boards, and some things have changed since, so for the better, and some for the worse. Let's hope we can make more changes for the better here.\n\n> The NA Players Relations team has recently been taking a wide look at what makes the NA League Community a great experience, and the NA Boards obviously figure pretty heavily in that picture. During a previous conversation, I mentioned that we&rsquo;d completed a day-long workshop discussing both the current state of the NA boards and our long-term goals for them.\n\nFor transparency sake, is the boards public allowed to know who is on this team? It would be nice to know the people in charge of making changes to this platform, and maybe get to know them a little. I suppose their option to post is completely up to them, but I feel communication with the players, as you are doing here, works out best.\n \n\n> * What makes the North American Boards the North American Boards?\n\nWell tbh, weren't the EU boards and Oceania also ported here as well? I really don't have any problem with that, as we all pretty much seem to speak the same language. It's quite weird though that, as I recall, these regions also have their own separated boards as well as linking to NA. If this is still the case, why is it so? Shouldn't they either be fully integrated into one board, or fully separated? Seems like a weird community split to me, but maybe I'm misinformed.\n\n> * What are our goals when it comes to moderation?\n\nOh boy, here's the big one. Obviously in a perfect world we wouldn't have people trying to push the rules. We wouldn't have people being jerks for the sake of being jerks. That said, there is a time and place for some content that can be lewd or perceived as 'being a jerk', and if people can respect boundaries, these posts should be allowed to stay up. Some things of course cross the line too far overall, and should not be allowed in any case. Here's a few examples to clear up what I'm saying.\n\n1) The \"don't be a jerk\" rule: specifically on GD (as this is the group I know best) there are a number of players that have known each other for years. Some get along well, and certain \"cliques\" have been formed, as Riot Wookieecookie was all too keen to point out. There needs to be some level of leniency for things that are meant to be taken as a joke to exist, either between players, or just in context of threads themselves.\n\nIt is not ok to tell people to kill themselves. Someone who posts something along the lines of \"Akali is such a cancerous champion, facing one after level 6 make me want to kill myself\" on the other hand is something that is meant as an exaggeration. These aren't actual suicide threats, and it only takes reading the actual context to realize that. This is something players have had removed, or been banned for in the past.\n\nUsing swear words is ok in context, as long as the intention isn't cruel. The word itself should not be bannable in the majority of cases if used in a way that isn't meant to insult another player. A few exceptions to this exist, like the N-word for example, which society has deemed offensive in and of itself.\n\nThat said, minor insults should be acceptable to a degree. A player should be able to back up their claims that \"the OP is stupid\" with evidence, but not being able to do so it not a bannable offense to be honest. Let players debate the way they choose to until they cross reasonable boundaries. reasonable people already know that \"Everyone below diamond sucks\" or \"support players are all stupid\" aren't true, and are overused bait statements. If these threads or comments aren't spammed, they can be let be a majority of the time, as moderation effort is best focused elsewhere.\n\nThe players that need action taken against them are the ones who are legitimately bullying others, attempting to cause chaos, releasing classified information, etc.\n\n2) The artwork rule: artwork is subject to interpretation, and each persons opinion on what is acceptable or not is going to differ. This is no exception for moderation, but some type of relegation may help here. A few key things to remember; whether or not the image is of a real life person or drawn should not matter, unless the image is of a real life person who does not want their image posted, and someone else is doing it against their will.\n\nAside from that point, fan art threads are common. Selfie threads pop up every once in a while. Point is, a lot of this art is meant to be seductive, such as the drawing 'genre' known as ecchi. If an image is posted that blatantly shows genitalia (including naked breasts, @ IonCannonKarthus), these posts need to be removed, and repeat offenders should have action taken against their account. That part has always been obvious, but it seems the moderators have different views on where the line is drawn beyond that. I can understand that borderline material will get deleted here and there, and it can't be avoided, but many of the moderators documented mistakes would be laughable if they weren't downright depressing. The moderators need to get on the same page on what is acceptable and what isn't, and remove their own personal bias because they themselves are overly conservative. I'd remind them that this game is rated T for teen, not E for everyone, but people forget that online interactions aren't even regulated by the ESRB. Sometimes it's ok to let players have their fun within reason, so there is no need to vastly censor many of these threads or posts.\n\nThese images should be acceptable in context of the threads\n\nLow cut dress, but nothing shown that shouldn't be:\nhttp://puu.sh/ifums.png\n\nShow some religious tolerance on this one, even if certain GD'ers refuse to:\nhttp://puu.sh/ifup8.jpg\n\nThese characters exist in your game with the same outfits:\nhttp://puu.sh/ifuEh.png\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, if it exists and appears to this level of \"lewdness\" in the actual game itself, they players should not be banned for posting essentially the exact same thing. There is no logical argument as to why this should be happening, and Wookieecookie showed us this when he flat out refused to answer Evangele's question regarding the mater.\n\nAll this taken into account, images involving minors such as Annie SHOULD have a stricter policy on them. We do not need pictures of minors in suggestive poses or whatever, especially when it confuses the line for the rest of the rules.\n\nHowever, fan art of these champions should still be allowed to exist. Reining in the leash a bit more than for other champions or other images doesn't change that fact. A quick example of this...\n\nYes this picture is a fan art containing Annie and Lulu, but it by no means lewd:\nhttp://puu.sh/ifvcE.jpg\n\n> * How can we make Player-to-Rioter (and vice versa) engagement a better experience for both parties?\n\nA vast majority of us want more Rioters to post on GD and the boards in general, and/or to post more often. I've been told directly by many Rioters the reasoning as to why many don't wish to be there. Some feel intimidated by the harsh environment, others left due to harassment from loud members, etc. Players get mad over what they perceive to be screw up caused by Riot, and there is never going to be a way to please everyone. Additionally, many players actually believe that the first Riot to show their face on GD can fix whatever problem they happen to have. Usually, the players are there to correct them, because most of us know KateyKhaos is on the skins team, and won't be able to push through X players balance suggestions for their favorite champion. When the players aren't around though, it's people like Katey that have shown they can bite the bullet, and time and time again they can ignore the trolls while answering legitimate questions, and still have fun on GD. This of course does not mean that GD or the boards in general are for every rioter, and of course they don't have to be. The one big thing I have a problem with is rioters perpetuating the notion that GD is a hellhole that shouldn't be visited. Just because it didn't work out for them doesn't mean they need to convince their coworkers to avoid the website of the company they work for.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point, the website owned and ran by Riot games should probably be a key source of information for their game should it not? Staff should know that if they are going to post pertinent information regarding the league of legends game using a medium such as reddit, twitter, facebook, or whatever, that it should likely be attached to their own forum as well. It just makes sense to be honest, and I don't really see why this isn't being done more often. Additionally, we have websites like 'Surrender at 20' or 'Reign of Gaming' that give us updates on the PBE factor of the game, which directly ties into balancing. Why can't this information be posted to Riot's site directly instead of having to be data-mined and posted on a 3rd party site?\n\n\n\n\n\nI seem to be reaching to character cap for a single reply, and it's getting late, so the rest of my reply will likely have to come tomorrow.","replies":[{"poster":"Zwill","date":"2015-06-08T16:55:58.854+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"Hi there SNS!\n\n> For transparency sake, is the boards public allowed to know who is on this team?

Typically the people who care too much about balance don't care as much about lore and vice versa so it would be nice if we could choose which boards would filter into that front page. Then we could see the most popular posts about shit we actually care about all at once instead of having to go subject to subject.

In any case, the thread got deleted for \"reporting other players\".\n* Explaining that it isn't okay to make death jokes, but then the post itself gets deleted and the user gets warned that \"suicide is serious and here's a link to help you out if you are having suicidal thoughts\"\n* Somebody said \"kms\", they get the post deleted and the same \"suicide warning\"\n\nModerators are also extremely inconsistent. There was a call-out thread that probably should not have been on the Boards, but it was up for multiple hours and quite a few people were questioning why it was staying up so long. Even so, in the meantime other posts that were far, far more minor and inoffensive were getting deleted.\n\nAll-in-all, the moderation is way too touchy and needs to be toned down a ton.\n\n**It's gotten so bad that I've started screenshotting every single one of my posts** for fear that it will get deleted. If it does get deleted, then I have proof of what I said, and that I can open up a support ticket.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mr Broken Wings","date":"2015-06-07T18:45:56.785+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"Mods banned people for posting girls with apples because it represents \" a sin\".

There's currently 1 red post in the Red Tracker that occurred in Gameplay and Balance.  Do y'all post gameplay/balance related thoughts on Reddit?

But would you kindly share a thought?\n3a.

People post/vote on what they're interested in, and it just so happens that a lot of people want Riot's attention.\n- Toxicity... I'm not trying to sound like a relationship counselor, but maybe you need to post on the toxic discussions about why they're a problem.  \"When you post X, it makes me feel Y, and then I don't want to get engaged in this conversation.\"  Maybe that would be a good thing for the Visible Moderators to do.  But, other than that, I think you need to identify people who've phrased requests in a non-toxic way and either meet the requests or explain to them why you can't.  When you've made the people happy that are within your power to make happy, I think you'll see that the rest are a small minority.\n- \"Hot\" weights popularity very heavily, so it feels static (but that's the nature of showing the good content).  Maybe the lack of stickiness is due to the fact that people aren't looking at Recent, or that Recent weights popularity too much (so it's also static) or too little (so it shows too much mediocre content), or maybe you just need to make Recent the default.

(if you don't think it's healthy then you think it's unhealthy) You can have diverse levels of engagement (and diverse styles/culture), even if you do a cross platform import feature. These imported threads would lead to people heading into those other styles/types of communication, increasing the over all number of people/ideas that are shared/spread. Unless Riot thinks that the culture of Reddit vs the Boards is so different that you WANT it to be split to get different points of view. But even if that where true, and I don't believe it is, the culture of the forums being posted on would not see a change of any degree. Having this \"Red Reddit\" tracker wouldn't lessen or reduce communication, it would increase it. Which for a \"player based\" company, I would expect to be a major issue. Unless you can show how/why you think communication would suffer this way.\n\n> \n> There are many reasons to be silent on a post, from reasons as mundane as the person who _should_ reply isn't available to do so to reasons as complicated as us not being sure on how to respond.

It may not be the nicest post, but it isn't a total bashing post (OP wise).

It is an issue that is over 5 years old, and a bit embarrassing. Instead the post with 10 upvotes gets a Red response, even if it's just a short \"You the real MVP. ^-^\". \n\nAnd as for \"person who _should_ reply\" issue, well that's just plain wrong. It's been up for over a day at the top of the Front Page. You are telling me there isn't a SINGLE Rioter who saw the post, thought \"hey lot of people are having an issue with this\" and forwarded it to the RIGHT people? If that is the case, then it is mostly a failure of whomever is \"running\" the boards. If it is not the case, and the issue is \"not sure how to respond\", then Riot needs to vastly improve it's ability/willingness to communicate that. A simple \"we heard you, but are unsure at the moment of what direction we are going with this issue\". Or \"at the moment we think this is something we are planing to change but are back logged\". \n\nYou say it become a directive instead of discourse. Is not listening to a customer base a directive?
