You can expect an installment every two weeks or so, with Rioters from all over jumping in to spend some time with you on the Boards. \r\n\r\nThis week, we've got we’ve got Creator Support Specialist (and prolific cosplayer!) Sarah \"Jynx\" Kulyk!\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\n* Hey Everyone! I need to head back to work now, but will return later to answer some more questions. Thank you so much taking the time to chat with me today!\r\n\r\n\r\nHi Friends!\r\n\r\nMy name is Sarah, also known as ‘Jynx’ (no relation to the Loose Cannon). I’m Canadian, and work with the Creator Support Team in North America, with a focus on programs and support for cosplayers and community artists. In the past I’ve also worked on NA Social Media, and the Events QA team, assisting at LCS and other League eSports events.\r\n\r\nI’ve been at Riot for over 2 and a half years now, but before that I worked with Electronic Arts, freelanced as an artist on some indie/social games, and completed a Bachelor of Media Arts with a major in animation.\r\n\r\nI started playing League of Legends in Season 1, and quickly fell in love with the characters and co-op gameplay. It didn’t take long for me to start creating League cosplay and fan art after that! Since then my experiences with the community have been so rewarding, and I’m thankful to be a part of such a creative group. I love that I now get to support and work with content creators each day! \r\n\r\nMy adventure with games, cosplay and art has been a long one. I grew up as a dedicated console gamer, but now primarily play PC and Pen &amp; Paper. I started creating art and costumes in the mid 1990’s, and have never been able to stop! Armor and weapons are my favorite things to build and theorycraft, and this is why my house is now filled with giant props and craft supplies...\r\n\r\nDay to day I’m a bit of a hermit though, and spend a lot of time at home with my husband and 3 year old corgi St. Celestine, [who also likes to help out at Riot](http://imgur.com/hlizuJs). I love sci-fi, documentaries, obsess over Warhammer 40k a bit too much, and have a history of hoarding comics and other collectables. \r\n\r\nI’m looking forward to chatting more with you all, so feel free to ask some questions and I’ll try and reply as quickly as possible (sorry, I’m not the fastest typer). \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nJynx","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2015-12-09T21:05:00.098+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":5,"body":"I didn't know Celestine was a formally canonized Saint!

Thank you so much for your kind words and support.

Sometimes my friends don’t even recognize me, which is always funny. And even people who do know me, have always kind!\n\nI feel that as a Rioter, it’s a huge gift to stay connected to the community and learn from their experiences when possible. Every day I’m inspired by the amazing League cosplay from all around the world, and it’s been extremely motivating for me both creatively and professionally. \n\nI think my favorite aspect has been the opportunity to meet and collaborate with more creators than I ever could on my own.

Our goals are to be a resource for the community, help build connections between creators, and motivate those who are making awesome stuff! We’re also exploring ways to bring more educational content to creators, so they have the option to level up their craft. \n\nOverall this involves a pretty large range of content and executions. Everything from hosting a [Creator Lab](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/community/community-spotlight/all-chat-40-youtubers-locked-room), helping in the Cospitality Lounges, partnering with animators on a new [champion mix](https://youtu.be/zYd8D804bT0) or ‘Helmet Bro’ episode, and highlighting educational content in ‘The Climb’ articles. We also work with other teams within Riot to help them reach out to content creators and partner with the community.\n\nBecause of my background, I love working with the awesome artists and cosplayers in the community! This focus can also be a bit broad at times, but here's some examples of projects I work on: The [Fan Artist Features](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/fancreations/lXFM1iP2-fan-artist-feature-androoly), [Community Creation roundups](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/fancreations/adAu3yJf-kindred-community-creations), artist collaborations (Eg. [Gnar comics](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/community/community-spotlight/more-playtime-gnar), [Facebook stickers](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/community/community-spotlight/artists-behind-league-facebook-stickers), Poro holiday tags, Team Valentines, gamemode posters etc.), event programing for creators, social media, and some new projects that are still in the works.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2015-12-09T21:41:06.658+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gurl, your hair looks so GOOD.\n\nAlso who is your favorite champ since that is not a question?","replies":[]},{"poster":"BBQbeelzy","date":"2015-12-09T21:03:36.717+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your Darius cosplay was amazing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xxxxnoodlexxxx","date":"2015-12-09T21:00:16.451+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Jynx!

Even though it was a long time ago *cough*, I remember how intimidating it was to build my frst costume, and then share it with the community I love... IN PERSON! O_O I think it will always be a bit nerve racking (or at least it still is for me), but here are some things I’ve kept in mind and learned over the years that may help you out.\n\nFirst and foremost, have fun! For me cosplay is a positive and creative outlet to express myself, and share my passion for the characters/designs I love. So I always try to keep it that way (when possible)! At times I still find myself crunching for deadlines or taking on too many projects in my personal time.\n\nI don’t believe there is a finish line when it comes to art. Even after 20 years of building, I’m still learning techniques and trying out new materials. Whereas it took me a long time to get where I am now, I know others that have had very different experiences. So learn at your own pace and be patient with yourself. I also recommend against comparing yourself to others too much. You're on your own unique journey which a lot of creators will be able to relate to, and that's awesome!\n\nDon't be afraid to ask for help and learn from others. The online cosplay community has fostered a huge wealth of knowledge and resources! Chances are that if you Google it, you will find it. I recommend searching for tutorials using materials you’re interested in (EVA & craft foam is a great place to start IMO, and very forgiving to use). But it will also be a time investment, so allow yourself as many days, months, or years you need. Some people also work best when they have a crafting buddy! It’s always fun to have someone there to keep you company and motivate you to keep building. =)\n\nLastly, it’s okay to accept that your first piece might not turn out as you imagined. I remember the first cosplay I made (Sailor Moon R) had yellow tissue paper hair glued to a headband, no fingers in the gloves (because they were cut from a shirt), and everything was hot glued together because I didn’t know how to sew yet… this may be an extreme example. But still! Remember that you will learn from every project that you work on, and the chances are that each cosplay will be an improvement from the last. \n\nAll that being said, if you don’t have the time or desire to make something from scratch, there's always the option of commissioning a cosplay from a creator or buying something pre-made. I believe that cosplay can be for everyone, whether you’re an artist or not!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChewbaccasRear","date":"2015-12-09T21:50:32.362+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which rioter (apart from yourself) in your honest opinion has the best name?","replies":[{"poster":"Jynx","date":"2015-12-10T05:47:44.689+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"ManWolfAxeBoss","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Frascal","date":"2015-12-09T21:50:10.266+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"5 short questions I hope you can answer \n\nWho is your main champion?\n\nWhat is your favorite skin? \n\nBest cosplay you've ever seen?\n\nBest looking champion in design?\n\nhow are you :3?{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"EmpressofShurima","date":"2015-12-09T21:07:13.231+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You were a freelance artist and animator before working with Riot, how did you get to the position you have now supporting other artists in a community of a game you like?
