The outline goes away if the video is paused and only visible if it's playing. Not sure if it's limited to my setup or if it's a known issue.\namd graphics card and windows 10.\n\nedit: I should also mention that no other applications are going through and that it's not limited to \"youtube videos\" It goes through other games too. full screen or not.

It's actually so strange. If I open obs to try and record it the amount of times it happens drastically reduces but it's still there in really fast moving scenes. It also happens on both of my monitors. one of them using hdmi and the other using dvi.\n\nEdit: alright I think I figured it out. I had hardware acceleration disabled in chrome for color accuracy reasons when watching streams. Turning it back on completely fixes it. Like I mentioned before, this only happens with the League client for me. It might be my i5 3570k showing its age and not being able to handle the work on its own. [Some people have told me about turning this to full RGB but it doesn't solve all of the color problems. ](http://prnt.sc/dt9oaq)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-09T22:23:05.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for confirming what the culprit was! Since the League Client operates with a Chromium Base (same base that Google Chrome operates with) it makes sense why that setting had caused some issues.\n\nI'll be sure to note this down for future reference.
