Tried connecting to the game server and got the following RADS Error notification:\r\n\r\nCould not connect to the HTTP server.  Please check that your Internet connection is enabled and that your firewall is not blocking access.\r\n\r\nFunny it should do this considering I was just connected to the Steam servers playing Civ 6... went to check if it was me and go on to the Battle.net servers and ran a Greater Rift just to be sure... no problems.  Turned off WebRoot and Windows Defender and tried to reconnect... no dice.  Made sure to white list the LoL client in my port settings on my modem... big ole negatory.  Deleted/Uninstalled game, attempted to reinstall, can't even do that to download the patches.  So now I'm sitting here with a launcher shell and no game behind it.  Can't wait to see what happens next!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-02T03:09:03.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was most likely caused by an external network issue that was affecting a few of our services, login being one of them.
