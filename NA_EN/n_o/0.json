E-Sports = be sportsmanlike!","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"I know, it's a controversial topic, but saying \"ez\" / \"easy\" (or any variation of it, for the supersmart people out there going to say \"Oh WhAT aBoUt \"EaZy\"?) gets out of hand.\r\n\r\nI know, it's not a direct insult, but we have a summoners code and in my opinion we are also obliged to resepct our opponent, at the least as long as he tries.\r\nSome matchups are hard, but some enemies don't give up and you have to respect that! Nobody wants a quitter on his team because he has a bad game.\r\n\r\nAnd in that manner I think, writing easy is the most toxic, salty and offensive thing to write, at least to me.\r\nWhen I try to give my best, support my team with everything I got, even if I'm behind and do whatever I can instead of ragequiting like so many others, the worst thing an enemie can write to me is \"easy\", not respecting the efforts I took.\r\n\r\nAlso, me giving my best gives the enemie a challenge and fun in this game aswell, not winning a game after 15 minutes for an early FF but giving them the chance to play out their champ at least and have a bit of fun in lategame, because winning IS fun for them. But that's okay to me. Let them have their fun, I'll give my best for them!\r\n\r\nBut writing easy... Honestly, that sh*t gets to me. I feel completely disrespect in an game which we call an E-Sport and having no respect and no sportsmanlike behaviour in a game like this should be faced with a 0 tolerance because respect is where we even have to start, it's what we have to build on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, in advance to all the comments: Don't just write pointless oneliners please, give a clear and detailled opinion, I'll consider everyone writing \" easy\" as a comment as pure spam because it has no positive effect on this discussion whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time. {{champion:427}}","replies":[{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2020-02-11T10:08:24.174+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Solo que is not \"E-Sports\".","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2020-02-11T10:58:16.450+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on your definition.\n\nIsn't a casual game of soccer still a sport?\nIf so, why couldn't a casual game of LoL be considered E-sports?","replies":[]},{"poster":"N o","date":"2020-02-11T10:13:21.200+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KVbqbFsC8e,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=haMfoYbA,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2020-02-11T10:08:24.174+0000)\n>\n> Solo que is not \"E-Sports\".\n\nIt is yet an somewhat competitive environment which should be taken as such and the enemies/players should respect each other.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-02-12T03:47:29.035+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of the other original responses in this thread are as disrespectful as \"ez\". I'm gravely disappointed in this community.\n\n\"EZ\" is punishable. It's just relatively minor, but you should go ahead and *report it quietly* every time without shame. Remember that 9 reports has the same impact as 1 in an individual game, so it doesn't help to share that you're reporting. After all, looking at the other responses here, they don't have any shame. Let the automated system prick them for it.\n\nThat aside, I'm sure there are much more aggravating things that you've received than \"ez\". I'd like to know why, then, you chose to gripe about this. I have a few guesses- such as, it's minor enough that offenders are likely to get away with it, so you can't punish them for it, so you hate that they got to you and you can't get back at them. No offense intended- pure guess there. I have more to say depending on the answer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KimochiPomf","date":"2020-02-11T10:17:46.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"N o","date":"2020-02-11T10:33:34.259+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KimochiPomf,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=haMfoYbA,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2020-02-11T10:17:46.271+0000)\n>\n> if the game was easy , why i can't say that? oh sorry i can't just because people like you get mad/salty about it, dude rlly? \n> anyone can just type what they want , this is freedom right? btw as long people don't say get c ,get corona ecc you shoudn't make a post like this.
