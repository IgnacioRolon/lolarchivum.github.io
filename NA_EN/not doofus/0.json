WTF, why am i going to lose 20 lp because of this. Not even fair. Now instead of 2 games in a row to get to diamond 5 series, i need to win 3. This is BS","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-24T21:37:04.716+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We have a sticky post about this current issue, but it sounds like a patch mismatch failing to update you to the current version.  Restarting your client can fix this up, otherwise I recommend downloading the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and performing a Force Repatch to get you on the correct version.  I'm really sorry to hear about the LP loss, though, it sucks that happened and I hope these steps help.  Let me know if that works for you.","replies":[]}]}
