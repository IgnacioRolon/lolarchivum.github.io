She no longer feels like an assassin because of that Fiora style mechanic.\n-She is going to be cancer no matter how you try to balance her. The new shroud was a HORRIBLE idea but without it she&#039;s just too weak due to her delays and garbage AP scaling.\n-You turned a niche champion that was literally never banned into the highest banned champion in league with also the lowest winrate. (her winrate is currently sitting at 42%)\nIf you don&#039;t want to revert her or do something to make her Akali, can you guys just please make a new champion that has a kit similar to her old one?\n\nTL;DR\nYou made Akali into a bruiser with that stupid passive and gave her a 0 counterplay ability. Not fun to play, even less fun to play against.","replies":[]}
