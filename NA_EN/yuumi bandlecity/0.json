The Neeko skin is perfect and the Zoe one is pretty cool too.  I don't play much Xayah and Rakkan but they are nice too.

However, I do see where people are coming from when they compare them to Dark Star. At least, I see it in X&amp;R's recalls, but Zoe actually does feel on-theme imo (especially her E), she's just a darker version of Syndra. Though I can definitely understand the argument for her VO not working, but imo, X&amp;R's classic VO's wouldn't work for the theme either, and we can't have 3 legendaries :/. Zoe's VO does fit a bit more than their's do at the very least.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2019-08-26T19:47:03.353+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, at least my wallet will be save this time I guess.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spice and Wolf","date":"2019-08-26T17:26:39.839+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"You are not supposed to do an appreciation post on this forum, shame on you {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jenivie","date":"2019-08-26T18:12:03.020+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"i love them i love them i love them i love them i love them i love them i love them i love them i love themi love them i love them i love them i love them i love them   {{sticker:sg-jinx}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Glîtchy","date":"2019-08-27T01:25:18.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don’t like them, because Zoe is in the group","replies":[]},{"poster":"boricCentaur1","date":"2019-08-26T17:36:14.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually like all those champions funny enough.

Its shows riots increasing lack of care for anything that doesn't turn lots of purchases. Everyone knows what star guardian skins look like, we all know the theme, and how the particle effect look like. we get excited because we enjoy this theme alot. we get excited over who will be added next. They chose Zoe, Rakan, and Xayah three champs played to extreme degrees, and completely throw the theme of star guardian into the trashcan. That is why so many people are mad. Of course they look good, but its what they represent that is so angering.","replies":[]}]}
