I've disabled VSync, uncapped FPS, checked NVidia control panel and disabled Vsync globally, still locked at 60FPS. I don't want to hear that there's no need to go above 60FPS blah blah blah, I know that. I want to see my max FPS so I can adjust my video settings accordingly for a steady 60FPS stream (if possible).\r\n\r\nI have an i7 4700HQ, GTX 860M 2GB GDDR5, 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD. Occasionally when I alt+tab back into League my FPS will be uncapped momentarily and I will be around 225FPS but then it will decrease back to, and lock, at 60. I'm out of ideas. Any help is appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-08T02:37:21.530+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're running Windows 10, this is likely caused by the problematic *Game DVR* feature that Microsoft baked into their recent windows updates.
