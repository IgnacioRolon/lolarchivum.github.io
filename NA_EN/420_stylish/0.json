However, I've noticed something weird. All of our pings have been around 60 stable at night time, but while playing yesterday at around 4:30am all of our pings went back down to 40.  So our ping is only that high at certain times of day. Obviously it's not a seperate internet issue because all of my friends in Ohio are encountering the same issue and the ping is stable. I just find it a little weird because it randomly started happening just three days ago. We all have the same ISP, Time Warner Cable. \n\nAnyways, I'll get you the requested information asap. Thanks for responding.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShinyElbowGrease","date":"2016-08-16T05:36:38.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                          hitronhub.home -    0 |   85 |   85 |    1 |   31 | 2402 |    2 |\n|                          INTEL_CE_LINUX -    0 |   85 |   85 |    9 |   53 | 2421 |   27 |\n|                          INTEL_CE_LINUX -    0 |   85 |   85 |   12 |   54 | 2406 |   16 |\n|                          INTEL_CE_LINUX -    0 |   85 |   85 |   12 |   53 | 2410 |   15 |\n|van58-9-230-169.dynamic.rogerstelecom.net -    0 |   85 |   85 |   13 |   59 | 2413 |   23 |\n|                          INTEL_CE_LINUX -    0 |   85 |   85 |   15 |   62 | 2425 |   31 |\n|van58-9-230-134.dynamic.rogerstelecom.net -    0 |   85 |   85 |   25 |   70 | 2434 |   96 |\n|                          INTEL_CE_LINUX -    0 |   85 |   85 |   23 |   68 | 2434 |   31 |\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting & Cloud Provider","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-16T16:31:27.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your traceroute shows the latency inside your network spikes up to 2402ms and continues to remain in the 2400's across your entire route to the server.
