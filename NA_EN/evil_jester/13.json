You're really going to cry about accounts who have a small number of champs to play ARAM? There's not a single champion who is going to result in an ARAM win every single time. The highest winrate champ in ARAM is Illaoi at 61.5% (4.6% pick rate because people who have no clue just reroll her, the very same types of people who want bans in ARAM) -- guess who I always see people complaining about in regards to ARAM and wanting a ban feature? Veigar, who has a 52% winrate in ARAM. Blitz is 51%, yet is very commonly mentioned.\n\nYou claim that there is an issue. Your claims would also mean this issue is universal, due to the scope of said \"issue\". How in the hell could you argue that someone doesn't hold value in your claims simply due to them not affecting that person? Either the issue exists or it doesn't. If someone plays a single game of ARAM, with the \"issue\" you're claiming, they'd inherently have been affected. That, or, the issue is a construct straight from the minds of those who can't stand a loss even in a mode where champions are 100% random. Claiming that there's an issue which is breaking ARAM, then conveniently claiming that a person is opposed only because it doesn't affect them, is hypocrisy and selective logic.\n\nYou're going to lose ARAMs. Get over it. You can't win them all, and losing isn't always about some external faceless force bringing you down. Everyone who plays ARAM faces the exact same \"issue\" you're alleging exists. If you were _truly_ concerned by the \"issue\" you're creating, you'd also have considered the fact that you're just as likely to get an \"ARAM account\" on your team as your opponents are. You're simply finding absolutely anything which you can attribute your loss to, and making a big deal out of it. If they permanently reintroduced bans in ARAM, there would be another thread about some other \"flaw\"/\"issue\" responsible for your losses.\n\nBans won't rid you of the possibility of getting a highly counterable team like 100% AP, won't prevent you from getting all melee while the enemy has incredible mobility/range/cc, won't prevent you from getting the average ARAM player who has no clue how to play 99% of champs, and certainly won't account for your lack of knowledge on every champ in your pool. It's ARAM. FFS.","replies":[{"poster":"Teriyaki Bukkake","date":"2019-07-06T16:11:37.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Except there is no issue.

Are you aware that this applies to \"ARAM only\" accounts? Are you also aware of the pick rate you conveniently left out on the 61.5% winrate champ?\n\nI'll break it down for you. In SR you pick your champ. There are champs who have a high winrate in some elos, and low winrate in others. Your argument is like saying that you shouldn't be allowed to play a champ in a certain division because it has a high winrate. ARAM is almost exclusively low elo. I hardly ever see high elo players in ARAM. Thus, the pickrate vs winrate on Illaoi.\n\nThe fact is, you're here complaining because you lose ARAMs and think that \"ARAM accounts\" are somehow to blame. They're not. If bans are ever permanently introduced, you will be back, complaining about the next enigmatic external force bringing you down. That's just how bad players are. They blame losses on external forces, and never look introspectively at anything.\n\nBans will absolutely not solve ANYTHING. The proof is in the pudding -- all the \"bring bans back to ARAM\" bandwagoners bringing up champs with average/sub-par winrates in their arguments. I provided Illaoi as an example because no one brings her up in these threads. It's solid proof that people have ZERO clue who wins ARAMs, never bother to look up stats, and base their opinions on emotion.\n\nI can totally see how, with a massive lack of understanding, my post could've looked contradictory. However, with just a _bit_ more understanding on the game itself and the topic at hand, I can assure you, it's not. ;)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Anihaku","date":"2019-07-05T15:01:47.537+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":4,"body":"No","replies":[]},{"poster":"GreenKnight","date":"2019-07-05T10:58:36.129+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":6,"body":"Why were they taken away in the first place.
