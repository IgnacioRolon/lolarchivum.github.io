Still people act like assassins can't be played. The only tank that is really an issue anymore is sej and she is getting yet another nerf to her damage. The fact is, an assassin that knows what he is doing will always be useful as the ability to take out the enemies sustained damage in a fight before they can dish out much damage is a very useful tool.
