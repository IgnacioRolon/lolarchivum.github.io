I mean, I'm in mid-bronze and I only ever see an inter every 100 games usually. When I did my Flex placements, there was someone inting for literally the first 5 games, but it's really whatever.\n\nMe? I think the punishment for inting should be a lot more severe. First a 2 week ban, then a permanent ban. No warning before your 2 week ban, the notification for the 2 week ban says that next time your account will be deleted.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-02-25T11:14:15.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is generally how inting is treated.\n\nI have seen a couple of posts by people asking why they were banned and people pointed to very bad games in their history. 90% sure they were banned for that but I never went back to check if they posted about their support tickets. \n\nThey are few and far between mosly because they usually know why they were punished.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Magical Player","date":"2017-02-25T08:40:33.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well look at it this way\nWhen you get banned/punished for toxicity you clearly can say you were not it. You are clearly pissed about it, as words can be read in so many ways. One way you're not toxic, One way you are Toxic\n\nbut intent feeding is a tad more understandable by a user\nend a game 0/18/0 have 6 tears in a 25 min game, I mean yeah that is feeding no matter how hard you try to convince someone else.\n\nFeeding is also harder to detect is my guess by riot, as bad games happen yada yada\nSo feeding cases are clear cut cases to all(or should be)\nToxicity cases: people think what they say isnt toxic so they argue their case, and usually are never happy \nso they come to the forums to rant about how its unfair, the bs system, etc","replies":[]},{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2017-02-25T03:38:00.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have.

He also only got banned for toxic but never intentional feeding so I question this system Riot has.","replies":[]}]}
