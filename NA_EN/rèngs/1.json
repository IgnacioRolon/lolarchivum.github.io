Id like if you would reconsider Riot to at least give us Blue-ish aura around Dragon knight skin and Gold-ish around KOC. If we cant have full particle colors changes please at least give us different auras around them like you did with other skins. We as community are happy with changes but im not gonna lie it could been so much more but please just give us different auras around them and we are all set. Thanks for your time and sorry for spaming in your boards {{sticker:katarina-love}}","replies":[]}
