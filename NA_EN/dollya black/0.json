Ignore the mana and just look at the jungle passive. That think procs on aoe's, and stealing 4 health every second from every mob with aoe champs is actually really effective. If you do the math on shyv, it's more health than you get from the 8% jungle lifesteal on machete.\n\nI tried a standard \"speed jungle\" setup for shyv with attack speed marks and lifesteal quints, ferocity and resolve masteries. I tried it once in a bot match with machete (on which that setup should synergize the most) and once with talisman, both going from krugs, to wraiths, to red. The sustain on talisman was just better. Not only that, the health steal was enough to kill the little wraiths with one aoe. That probably speeds up your jungle route even more.\n\nYour full-length aoe's are only separated by 5 seconds, which is how long the talisman health steal lasts, so it's a pretty much a permanent health steal on all mobs you're facing all the time.\n\nTry it some more before stiffing it. You might like it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flyer Beast","date":"2015-11-19T04:45:28.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Agreed, Who the heck would start {{item:1039}} as {{champion:102}} .","replies":[]}]}
