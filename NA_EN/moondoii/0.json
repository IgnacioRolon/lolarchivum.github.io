Usually if you are supporting, go for items like Unholy Grail and Ardent Censer (makes your shield heal/buff allies). If you are playing support in a duo lane, upgrade that spellthief's edge ASAP, as it gives more gold. Once you earn 500 gold it can deploy wards, which is essential.\n\nAlso get boots. Every game, no question. Usually tier one boots after your first small item, then upgrade them once you have your first full item. That little bit of speed makes a huge difference, and the magic penetration on {{item:3020}} is a big damage boost.\n\nFor a damage-focused build, go for {{item:3285}} Ludens > {{item:3020}} Sorc Shoes > {{item:3916}} Oblivion Orb (maximize your flat magic pen) > {{item:3135}} Void Staff or {{item:3089}} Deathcap if you have a ton of gold/way ahead.\n\nThe builds can be mixed and there are other options, like upgrading {{item:3916}}  into {{item:3165}} if the other team has strong healing/regen, or {{item:3157}} to defend against assassins.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Baron Barian","date":"2019-09-08T07:45:15.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now, I've been playing a shit ton of ARAM lately, so while I'm not 100% sure for Summoner's Rift, this I can say; Some of the biggest \"oh shit\" moments I've been having lately includes getting rooted by Lux.\n\n\nBut, you are new, and you're still learning and playing with bots. If you've been liking her, then that's great since you're already getting familiar with someone, though once you get a better grasp of the game and what other champions there are, you'll understand better the strengths and flaws of Lux. Honestly, it's too early for you to worry about her place in the meta.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unstoppable Monk","date":"2019-09-08T07:39:28.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lux is generally used as a crutch so people end up being ego driven idiots that go insane if they don't have kills to steal from their team.
