I have noticed, that it looks very similar to the OLD league of legends client. I cannot click on anything on the bottom, such as friends list or notification tab. However, the only thing I can click is when I get a notification that just popped up, I can click to accept or decline like usual (the notification is, too, old league looking). I can join any game and get in game like normal, everything else is fine, but this is pretty aggravating not being able to click on any of the tabs on the bottom, and when I'm in the login screen, no animations play... I have scoured the entire internet, it seems like no one else on earth has had this problem. I have yet to reinstall LoL because right after I concluded that my league was jacked, I thought that maybe the next update would fix it.\n\nIt didn't. I found out today (the update that added One for All). I come here, my first time making a post on this, to find the greatest of warriors to help me fix this.. this... atrocity, without reinstalling league, and I also didn't resort to uninstalling because that would possibly be all day (slow internet) to reinstall and find out it doesn't work, I just want to find another solution to fix this. Please... help me... {{champion:32}}\n\nEdit: Just remembered a HUGE problem that made me flip, I can't access the hextech box thing because this league client is so old, it doesn't have the tab.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-16T21:50:26.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am the unmighty warrior, Porocles!  Your issue shall taste my spear, yet I have to say it's a really neat problem to have!  Take arms with our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and run a clean reinstall back to a fresh slate.  This should fix whatever is making your client look so ancient.
