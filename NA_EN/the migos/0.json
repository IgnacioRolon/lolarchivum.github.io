It's a random occurrence... sometimes it'll happen the exact moment after I log in, 5-10 seconds after, 2 minutes while waiting in the client, or when I'm creating a custom game. So far it hasn't happened in champion select luckily. But as I'm typing here, I can't even get into a game because my client has crashed 5 times in a row. Any idea how to solve this issue?\r\n\r\nI've also noticed that after I finish a game and go to my hextech crafting, the game will just exit without a message.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-28T16:15:51.673+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your issue might be due to corrupt game files, which can cause your client to crash.
