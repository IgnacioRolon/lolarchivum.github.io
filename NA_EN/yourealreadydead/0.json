I am a EUNE player and I wanted to make an NA account. After I created my new NA account I went and opened League of Legends. I changed the server from EUNE to NA and now every time I open the client it starts doing a loop of restarting and restarting instantly, I can't even close the game I have to shut it down from task manager. I tried the \"change the date\" method and it didn't work. What can I do besides reinstalling the game?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-19T23:36:18.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you change the region, the client just needs to download the new language packs and such for that region. If it keeps going in a loop, that means the client isn't able to get a strong enough connection to download those files properly. Try switching to an ethernet connection, but if that doesn't work check off the other steps listed in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).","replies":[]}]}
