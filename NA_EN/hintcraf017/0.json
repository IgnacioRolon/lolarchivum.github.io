Riot you should realy rethink how the chat ban system and stuff works. Because this is not ok.\n\nAnd yeah if you read it to this point before you start telling me how **I&#039;m a little bitch **and its all deserved just stop and don&#039;t even waste your time because that&#039;s not the reason I posted this.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2017-05-05T19:36:52.169+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"You're hyper focused on a single game here, when in actuality you the game referenced wasn't even the most severe that was considered for your penalty. 1/4 of you recent games include harassment, which is why you were chat restricted.\n\n> its all deserved just stop and don't even waste your time because that's not the reason I posted this.\n\nWhat is the point you are looking to make?","replies":[{"poster":"Hintcraf017","date":"2017-05-05T20:58:24.446+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":9,"body":"Tbh I am not looking for a point.I am just trying to showcase something and what impression people take from this is completly their own thing.

You admit to flaming them. What are you expecting?\n\nAlso, you also have no idea if other people are being chat banned either unless you get an instant feedback report, however those are only given to the reporters in the game that triggered the instant punishment.
