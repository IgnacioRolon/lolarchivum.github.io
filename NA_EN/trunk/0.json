I would like to know if riots stopped supporting windows 7 in their game updates. my ping is a stable 58 and my fps drops down below 10fps in team fights when its 5v5. this has only started happening recently and I would like to know why. its not my 8 core cpu or 16 gigs of ram. my fps drops with high settings and low settings on video card at the same rate meaning its the game after the update. before the 7.6 update i was gettin 400 fps at any setting. thanks riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-02T01:31:40.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Windows 7 is definitely still supported!
