This item is also one of the biggest reasons why many Mages will never see any interesting AP item choices because of how inherently strong it is for laning. I don&#039;t know why this item has been allowed to be a staple for so long. It&#039;s probably not as exciting when you can&#039;t watch people spam their abilities, but it&#039;s a little ridiculous that Mages are even allowed to do that in the first place. \n\n**Idc about LC$. Mages are are supposed to be gated by mana requirements.**","replies":[{"poster":"KuroCaliber","date":"2017-06-22T19:57:36.925+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Season 2 had Mana pots, case closed","replies":[{"poster":"Iriya","date":"2017-06-22T20:02:30.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Getting mana back over time being costly vs leveling up to get 20% mana constantly right till the end of laning phase while building a really strong offensive item with high CDR.

At that point you were allowed to regain Mana and spam spells for less gold than chapter.  At least chapter does not give CDR and Morello only gives 20% CDR when you complete the item.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2017-06-22T19:50:38.679+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"You can take my lost chapter when you remove all manaless champions from the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Clementine","date":"2017-06-22T19:56:33.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Most champs who are manaless are balanced around it. {{champion:266}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:238}} are all fine being manaless.

Mana Manipulator was there in Vanilla League, then Cata was there which was basically Lost Chapter, exactly the same thing except it also gave health when you leveled up.

So I have no idea what era of League you played that had mana Management.\n\nIf you want to play a game with mana management, go play Dota 2.
