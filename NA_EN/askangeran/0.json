The steps in the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide should help fix that up.  \n\nHowever, on a Mac the culprit might also be a connection issue failing to reach the patching service.  I also recommend running through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide as well to rule out these possibilities and get the patcher up.
