Takes a long time for the loading screen to even show up. In rarer cases the game will start without me. I recently loaded into a game just to watch the Defeat explode onto my screen from the remake.\r\nIn game, Constant ping spikes anywhere between 100-250 every couple seconds. Some times it will get worse and completely disconnect me from the game.\r\n\r\nI used to play with solid 30 ping, what the hell is going on? I can't even play the game anymore!\r\n\r\nI've run hextech repair tool probably 3 times a day, changing the settings each time for the last 2 weeks as administrator. A few days ago, I stopped lagging for about 12 hours after using it, but I think it was more or less a coincidence.\r\n\r\nI just want to play league of legends ;-;","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-12T03:34:49.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Changes in latency (ping) are often caused by network routing by your ISP.
