This made playing Team Builder with my friends impossible last year.)\r\n\r\n- 9 times out of 10, my end of game stats wont load and I'll be forced to skip without waiting for stats\r\n(Basically don't get to report, honor, after game chat, or see my grade etc.)\r\n\r\nIt's somewhat of a minor inconvenience but has been screwing with me for much longer than I can handle at this point.\r\n\r\nI also have another friend with the same problem, and have actually had this problem still, even when on another computer.
