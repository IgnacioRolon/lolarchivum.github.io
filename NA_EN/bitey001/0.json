So there's a few exceptions but that's just one ability. Where as Annie you'd be changing the fire in all of the abilities and and well the orange flames still do fit this theme quite well.\n\nTrundle's pillar isn't a particle effect as it's much more of a part of the character than simple glitter effects or fire. It'd look plain weird to see Trundle with an ice pillar in a police/junkyard/baseball skin that it's kind of necessary that he get his pillars made to match his skin *just like Tibbers is made to match every Annie skin.* Everyone forgets that Tibbers gets a new skin as well.\nThat being said though, recoloring the fire would be the most basic way to compliment Annie skins since so much work has to go into Tibbers alone. In the past, Riot has stated that 975 skins and up get new particle effects, yet her Annie is with the majority of her skins 975 and up lacking any kind of additional particles whatsoever. \nKateyKhaos, why do Annie's other skins, like Prom Queen, Reverse, and Annie in Wonderland, which sit at or above the 975 cost, have no special effects other than Tibbers? Frostfire and Panda have special effects, so what about the rest of them?","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2015-01-30T05:20:05.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, that's why I'd say it'd be weird if they DIDN'T change that for him.\n\nAs for Annie, the wonderland skin is an OLD legendary and most all of those have nothing special.   Only recent one I can think of that has new effects is Fire Fighter Trist thanks to her VU, though Annie got a VU awhile back and that one still never really got much difference.","replies":[{"poster":"QueenAqua","date":"2015-01-30T18:43:05.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You forget Super Galaxy Rumble if your talking about recently released legendaries.
