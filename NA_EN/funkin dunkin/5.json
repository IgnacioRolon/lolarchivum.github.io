It has also never been a core build thanks to its completely defensive stats hence it's not everyone's favourite to immediate rush onto (which thank god), but now it is, and it's creating a massive problem.\n\nHell, the current item name also makes no sense to its own stats now too. Why would a \"Guardian Angel\" give their subject more AD? At least if you have to, make its offence qualities something along the lines of Sunfire Cape or Dead Man's Plate or something, straight up giving the character more AD is just imo unfathomably stupid on so many levels.\n\nLet's be real, I rather suspect the very reason why this change was passed, was trying to fix the imaginary \"lol adc 2k17\" issue that's never there in the first place. And even if you have to \"fix\" it, why would the most ridiculous solution be the one that ultimately passes the QA? I don't get it.\n\nSure, do more testing, I insist. But in the end, I highly wish the change would simply be reverted instead of having more random changes that drives the rabbit hole further, or even end up straight-up ruining this iconic item such as having the revival removed, all because of this 1 utterly silly mistake that shouldn't have happened to begin with.","replies":[{"poster":"Atanchan","date":"2017-05-08T02:13:12.573+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, have you seen Biblical angels?

Not to mention that offensive value from the passive is worsened by the fact that you need to take magic damage and be taken below 30% health to trigger it, meaning that it has to be carried with other defensive stats to leverage it well or else you'll just get blown up by physical damage before you can benefit from it.\n\nAlso, to put it in perspective, Bloodthirster is 78.9% efficient from raw damage, but it also has a huge chunk of life steal that is always active, which means that its main defensive component scales _really_ well with DPS, unlike GA's armor and revival which don't interact with DPS at all, or Maw while inactive and doing it far worse while inactive. It also effectively provides 120 - 350 bonus health depending on how soon you get it, which is only a bit under the health Sterak's gives late in the game, which makes it a completely efficient item ... at level 2, when that effective health is 60.\n\nBlade of the Ruined King is another example. Its minimum offensive efficiency is only 71.8% in comparison to Bloodthrister ... if it's attacking a target with less than 188 health. Against a target with 1000 or more health? 118.4% of offensive stats and rising at the health rises, before factoring in defensive stats. Which, since it gives only 5% less life steal than Bloodthrister, also scales really well the user's DPS, which BotR provides a lot of bang for its price tag against anyone who isn't limping or severely underleveled. And that's _before_ factoring in its active, which is a great tool for offensive chasing or defensive kiting ...\n\nI mean, BotRK is even _really good right now_.\n\nIt's really just you guys having arbitrary definitions of what's \"right\" for a DPS's defensive item. As long as it's life steal or otherwise has no offensive value whatsoever, it's fine. As soon as armor or magic resist find itself on an item with 20 AD, though? Comment chains like this happen.

Yah, they get more damage, but what if theres a fed ahri or syndra? no mr. Ever hear that people ridicule low lvl players for only building full damage with no defensive items? If you dont have any ap to counter the new GA, thats a problem. Even before these GA changes, you should have some ap AND ad. All I see is a shift in meta for the item. Not really a power change. It offers less defense for more damage and opens these hard carry champs to having a magic weakness.\n\nMight be an unpopular opinion, but a valid one.","replies":[{"poster":"PrinceOfStorms","date":"2017-05-08T11:07:39.853+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not the fact that GA has armor. The issue is the fact that an item that was already really good on AD champions was buffed further for them. If Riot wanted to prevent tanks from using it, they should have just deleted the item entirely.","replies":[]}]}]}
