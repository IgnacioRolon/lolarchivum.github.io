Therefore , I decided to write a sequel to her Lore and couldn&#039;t help but include other champions in my story . \r\nAfterwards, a friend of mine came to me with the idea of turning my story into a comic that she&#039;d help me to draw . \r\nSo, my questions to you are  :\r\nIf we decide to turn our project into something lucrative , would we be facing copyright issues with Riot Games as it&#039;s the company that owns the characters included in our work ? \r\n Would Riot Games be willing to promote our work as they have done in the past with previous artists if they deem it worthy of promoting ? \r\nI thank you in advance for taking the time to read and reply to my questions .\r\nHow do we get Riot to notice us ? #Noticemesenpai \r\nThank you for taking the time to read this and to answer my questions ! \r\nAny forms of help are welcome . \r\nThank you again .","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2016-09-14T23:41:10.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This might help - it's the [legal jibber jabber page](http://www.riotgames.com/legal-jibber-jabber)!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-09-14T18:44:13.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You probably couldn't market it as the same character or in the same universe. Instead you'd need to alter some things so that it isn't Valoran. \n\nI know how you feel though. I wish my fanfics could be promoted or at least bring some interest to Rioters.","replies":[]}]}
