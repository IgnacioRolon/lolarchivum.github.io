I dont get a fair, balanced game.. not one since release. One sided domination in my favor and against me... is it maybe since it&#039;s been implemented people started coming out of the woodwork to play again??? Cause holy *explicit* this game is not fun when it&#039;s one-sided mayhem. *explicit* RITO!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Xi0a6RCAGv","date":"2016-01-19T15:49:28.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thought.\nLevel 22 and at least 1 plat / diamond player almost every game..\nI can keep up with them but still..

Normally they're in the 50-52% range. I would suggest there is significant deviation, which might be because of queue times and role selection.\n\nMaybe, not sure, the longer you stay in queue the more likely your match will be \"unfair\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDiff","date":"2016-01-18T14:49:42.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah almsot all of my games feel like that now. I would say about 1/4 games maybe even 1/8 is sort of even. Sort of. However, once a team gets a solid lead the snowballing effect it has on either team just makes it so one sided. \nHowever, all games start 0-0. It's your job to make it in your favor.","replies":[]}]}
