If a program has the potential to offer you a *competitive advantage*, that's generally when we'll look at taking action on it.

My account was permanently suspended for third party programs. I used custom skins and from what I have heard, the only legitimate program that can get you suspended was MKJogo. I have used it before, but not after the warnings that were sent out beforehand. Anyways, to go into more detail, I have made 3 forum posts over the past few months with lots of comments, views and upvotes without a Riot response. I feel like my ban was really unwarranted and it really hit me with depression knowing that I have basically loss all my progress and money I had put into that account. So I am here on the forums because this is really the best way to communicate with riot and I have seen many receive help here from similar situations like mine. Thank you in advance","replies":[]}]}]}
