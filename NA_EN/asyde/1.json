It is already vastly inferior to Sunfire Cape, or any other tank item for that matter in just about every way.\n\n**Let&#039;s talk about the damage:**\nIncreasing the base damage but lowering the scaling was obviously intended to buff early game clears while reducing it&#039;s late game damage. Thanks, i guess... But you&#039;ve actually lowered the mid/late game damage by 40%! WHAT?! \n\nYou&#039;ve gone from 43 damage per second (matching sunfire cape @ lvl 18) to 25.8 damage per second @ lvl 18. Do you feel the late game damage was oppressive? any more so than Sunfire Cape? If so, why not target Sunfire Cape as well?\n\n_**EDIT: WHELP! This is embarassing, I read the changes to the damage backwards. RIOT is increasing the damage from 25.8/sec to 43/sec to match sunfire. Thank you RIOT! **_\n\n**Let&#039;s talk about the health:**\nCurrently the health is 400 +15% bonus HP. 400 is an acceptable amount of health if the scaling was larger, but while 15% sounds like a lot, it literally provides LESS effective health, in a 5 HP item build, than a SINGLE HP/Armor item. Yes you heard me correctly. While part of the tradeoff for this item is that it provides jungle benefits, even at a level 18 HEAVY hp build, its less effective than any other tank item.\n\n**The math (please correct me if i&#039;m wrong):**\n{{item:3068}} 500hp + 50 Armor (500 x 1.5) = 750 Effective HP (against ad) with 43/second aura.\n{{item:3742}} 500hp + 50 Armor (500 x 1.5) = 750 Effective HP (against ad) with movespeed / stacking charge.\n{{item:3143}} 500hp + 60 Armor (500 x 1.6) = 800 Effective HP (against ad) with 10% reduction from crits, active movespeed slow, and passive attack speed slow.\n{{item:3083}} 850 Effective HP + hp regen &amp; passive health regen above 3k HP.\n\n{{item:3102}} 500hp + 70 MR (500 x 1.7) = 850 Effective HP (against magic) w/ HP regen and passive spell shield.\n{{item:3065}} 500hp + 70MR (500 x 1.7) = 850 Effective HP (against magic) w/ HP regen, 10% CDR, and 20% increase to healing received.\n\n**NON-SCALED: ITEM ONLY**\n{{item:1401}} 400 hp + 15% bonus hp (400 + (400 x .15)) = 460 Effective HP (against all types) w/ no armor or MR, w/ 25.8/second aura, smite, and jungle benefits.\n\n**SCALED**\nLet&#039;s look at a typical cinderhulk tank build (Volibear):\n{{item:3009}} {{item:1401}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3053}} {{item:3075}} \n\nThe total base/bonus hp of this build is 1900. with the 15% increase from cinderhulk (285hp), that brings the effective HP cinderhulk provides in this build to 685 without any armor or MR. Notice it does NOT outscale any of the effective hp stats of the tank items listed above in terms of HP. \n\nHow much bonus HP would it take to actually make the effective health of cinderhulk equal (but not better) than sunfire/deadmans? (lowest effective hp of tank items). 2333.33 bonus HP. You would literally have to have 4x 500+HP items plus cinderhulk in order to BARELY make cinderhulk as tanky as any other tank item in the game.\n\nI know most people don&#039;t do the math like this, but this boils down to the item feeling very underwhelming as a good choice for the jungle. So I&#039;m perplexed as to why RIOT feels it needs to be toned down even further when it is already an underpowered item. \n\nDoes anyone else feel the same? Why does this need to be nerfed out of existence?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2016-04-20T23:31:50.178+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"> You've gone from 43 damage per second (matching sunfire cape @ lvl 18) to 25.8 damage per second @ lvl 18.

And I agree if your goal is to maximize tankiness vs both AP and AD, then increasing health is a good place to start. \n\nBut here is what i'm saying. (using the build i listed in my original post)\n\nVolibear\n2132.48 base hp @ 18\n+400 base hp from cinderhulk\n+500 from deadman's plate\n+500 from spirit visage\n+500 from sterak's\n+15% of the bonus from cinderhulk (285)\n\nTotal = 4317.48 total hp.\n\n+150 armor from deadman's & thornmail\n+70 MR from Spirit visage\n\nTotal EHP vs AD = 10,793.7hp (4317.48 x 2.5)\nTotal EHP vs AP = 7339.716hp (4317.48 x 1.7)\n\nBut if we replace cinderhulk with sunfire and replace sterak's (damage item) with warrior or any other damage item, you'd have less total HP, but stronger scaling.\n\nVolibear\n2132.48 base hp @ 18\n+500 from sunfire\n+500 from deadman's\n+500 from spirit visage\n\nTotal = 3632.48 total hp\n\n+200 armor from deadman's, sunfire & thornmail\n+70 MR from spirit visage\n\nTotal EHP vs AD = 10,897.44hp (3632.48 x 3)\nTotal EHP vs AP = 6175.216 hp (3632.48 x 1.7)\n\nSo in the end, against AD you'd actually be tankier, but do more damage. VS ap, you'd lose just a bit of tankiness, in exchance for damage cause we didn't add in any more MR to compensate.\n\nSo taking this all in, It's obvious that cinderhulk is still a good option if your looking to go 100% tank without damage. But you'd gain significant damage by picking up any other jg item, and insert another Armor/MR tank item to be stronger overall.\n\nMy point: for an HP scaling item, you're not really gaining much (if any) effective hp by going cinderhulk vs something else. (so long as you include another armor/mr item). And that seems counter intuitive to what the item is all about.\n\nAnd keep in mind this is assuming nearly 100% tank builds. Many players choose to play cinderhulk with other damage items, which limits the hp and resist scaling and makes the health less valuable.","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-04-21T00:55:57.422+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Asyde,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NPVR20Mh,comment-id=0000000100000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-04-21T00:44:54.757+0000)\n>\n> Total EHP vs AD = 10,793.7hp (4317.48 x 2.5)\n> Total EHP vs AP = 7339.716hp (4317.48 x 1.7)\n> \n> Total EHP vs AD = 10,897.44hp (3632.48 x 3)\n> Total EHP vs MR = 6175.216 hp (3632.48 x 1.7)\n> \n> So in the end, against AD you&#x27;d actually be tankier, but do more damage.

I'm pretty sure this is intentional to ensure that buying armor to counter AD is generally the right choice  over raw hp because that is the more intuitive conclusion to draw from looking at a stat that increases general tankiness vs. a stat that is only effective against some champions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Boltrix","date":"2016-04-20T23:37:28.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sotere's Right, it's a buff dude, you're reading it backwards. :D","replies":[{"poster":"Asyde","date":"2016-04-21T01:06:31.671+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Boltrix,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NPVR20Mh,comment-id=00000002,timestamp=2016-04-20T23:37:28.229+0000)\n>\n> Sotere&#x27;s Right, it&#x27;s a buff dude, you&#x27;re reading it backwards. :D\n\nI know! /facepalm haha xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zerfallen","date":"2016-04-20T23:34:22.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They most definitely did.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2016-04-21T03:08:31.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe something like 350 hp and 20% extra hp could be a good solution!","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheLastBaron88","date":"2016-04-21T00:16:07.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do feel like OP is right about the HP scaling on cinderhulk though. In fact, it kinda bugs me that most of the jungle items are just a weaker version of another existing item one might build on a laner. I mean, as a jungler, even with all the crap you're expected to do to have an impact on the game, and serious shortage of consistent gold income (a jungler that isn't snowballing off of kills has to fight to farm enough camps to stay ahead of a Support's gold income), resulting in junglers completing their build later than any laner, which is all fair, mind you... but considering all of that, shouldn't it feel like your jungle item isn't just filling in a slot while you complete the rest of your build, only to be sold for its better version later?\n\nIn regards to Cinderhulk specifically, having a tank jungler means several things. If they're your only major tank, this means that while their early and mid game significance is derived from solid gank pressure, their objective control and ability to farm vs more aggressive jungles is a given compromise. Cinderhulk's damage serves to allow them to farm at a reasonable speed once they have it, but the actual stats otherwise fail to really make up for what you are missing by not putting your tank in top lane to get all that juicy minion gold. So maybe in the past Cinderhulk has made for some overwhelming mid game tanks, but maybe it could be allowed to grant the powerspike of faster clearing early, and tankier tanks in the late game?","replies":[]}]}
