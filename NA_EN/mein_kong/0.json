Would you consider producing something more into Nick Phoenix's style?(cohessive use of traditional instrumental organs, lack of vocals, clear deffinition of beginning-middle-ending, melody that feels like a journey to another world compared to Bergersen's feeling of:\"let's go on a adventure\" kind of production) <=personal interpretation of a person's whos only relationship with music making is a younger brother that plays the saxophone e.g. I'm talking out of my ass.\n\nPersonaly I would see that style fitting more to champions who have more subbtle and dimensional struggles. It also help give a bit of personality instead of just straight up epicness. As always though it's up to you, you have the creative freedom to do whatever the fuck you want and screw other's opinions, I'm just throwing stuff out there hoping you won't mind.\n\nLast but not least, I've always wondered how such productions happen. Do you use programs(I don't need to know which ones, just how)? Do you synthesize samples together? Do you play the instruments yourself and then produce with the means of digital media? How did you get vocals in? Were they premade samples and you just \"put\" them in? Whatever you'd like to respond to I'd really apriciate since it would greatly satisfy my curiosity. \n\nPS.
