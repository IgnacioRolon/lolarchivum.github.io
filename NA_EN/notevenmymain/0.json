Or perhaps it&#039;s because mixed damage is fundamentally broken. When they did work, like 4 years ago they were far too powerful and ended up getting nerfed. My friend and I came up with a vague concept, a skeleton build I suppose, that might remedy this.\r\n\r\nThe idea is similar to the way supports work in that their utility benefits from AP. Have their skill&#039;s damage scale with AD, and offer an AP incentive to buff up their utility. This utility could range from anything like CC, to augmenting abilities with bonus magic damage or something.\r\n\r\nWith the scaling split up like this it gives you the option to build a straight up AD bruiser with no augmented abilities, a hybrid with the best of both worlds, or a utility heavy, low damage AP bruiser. I think it makes for a versatile champion, but one that can&#039;t easily abuse all of its advantages.\r\n\r\nI&#039;d really like to see a champion actually put rageblade to use again. If you guys have any criticism, suggestions, or even got an idea from this post, please feel free to comment any of it below or use this idea to make your own concept champion.","replies":[{"poster":"DeloricVI","date":"2015-04-16T07:41:56.502+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly, the reason that hybrid damage champions don't work is because of how items work. If you split your build, what do you have? Let's look at the signature items of each kind of build, and see why they are bad for hybrids, shall we?\n\nAP\n\nRabadon's Deathcap, Zhonia's Hourglass\n\nRabadon's gives you % ap. This means that you can't really make a good build with it (or take full advantage of it) without building full AP. Zhonia's is... kinda bland without it. You get your excellent stasis effect, but without rabadons, 120 ap doesn't get you very far, unless it's still the early game. If it is, then you probably haven't gotten enough gold to build it, or you're incredibly fed. If that's the case, you should probably build luden's echo or rabadons instead.\n\nInfinity Edge, Bloodthirster, Last Whisper\n\nThese items aren't good for champions that could use an AD compliment to their magic damage. If you're going for AD on a champion these items make you go all for it. What use is all that crit damage if you only have 20% crit chance? 20% is not as good as many may think. It is still 1/5  of the time, but it would be so much more advantageous to grab phantom dancer, or whatever else will boost your crit chance. Also, with bloodthirster and last whisper, the benefits are purely for AD, and are weak if you don't go all in for it. Since lifesteal and spellvamp are different and separate, other than with hextech gunblade, there's not much you can do with only one or the other. Most of the time, the enemy team is going to build one kind of defense with a little of the other so you're probably going to focus on what they didn't build against anyway if you're playing hybrid builds. If you can get away with either, then why not just pick while you're out in lane as the enemy builds your weakness?","replies":[{"poster":"NotEvenMyMain","date":"2015-04-16T08:10:22.402+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Our idea is actually trying to lean away from those things. The reason why hybrids right now don't work is because abusing multipliers from those sources is much stronger. A champion using our idea should be a bruiser, not someone who relies on auto attacks, so IE shouldn't be considered priority. The damage from their skills is not directly scaling from AP. I leave the idea open, because a hybrid should have mixed damage of some sort, but it's just a skeleton, not an actual champion. The choice of AP is there to add utility of some sort\n\nAn example would be\nQ: Generic Slash Skill:\nDoes 100+ ((ratio)total AD)\nSkill stuns for 0 sec + ratio*AP\nor\nW: Barbaric Buff Shout\nDoes 20+ ((ratio)bonus AD)\nAuto attacks for the next 5 seconds emit magic damage in an AoE around you dealing 30+ ratio*AP\nand slows enemies by 0%+ratio*AP\nor\nE: Mobility Creep\nPerform leap to target location dealing 9999+ ((ratio)toal AD) in an AoE\nIncreases movement speed of yourself and nearby allies by 0%+ratio*AP\n\nAll of this I just came up with on the spot, but if you apply correct scaling you get the idea.\n\nTo sum it up, the champion's damage would scale with AD, but you have the option to give up some of that AD for mixed damage and utility instead. If you go too far into the AP by build APC items like Zhonya's and Death cap, instead of ending up as a straight up burst mage, you've just got a bunch of utility on your hands.\n\nBuild AD = No CC tons of damage\nBuild Hybrid = Moderate CC, Mixed damage, minor utility\nBuild AP = Tons of CC, Ally buffs, pretty much full on support/tank\n\nThe scaling on these skills should lie somewhere that gives most of the incentive to build hybrid. The hybrid build should not fall too far behind pure AD. I think the best way to do that is to add a soft cap to AP scaling, so that you get a good chunk of your AP potential just by buying Trinity, Gunblade, and Rageblade. Then make the physical half of the skills scale off of total AD instead of bonus AD. With this your average 220-270 AD hybrid build wouldn't be so lackluster in damage in comparison to 300-350 AD bruiser build.","replies":[{"poster":"Narasimha","date":"2015-04-16T13:31:18.719+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The idea is great, but its kind of already been tried, and it didn't work.\n\n{{champion:10}} - essentially, the 'best' hybrid champion we have right now.

Probably.\n\nI really like the concept of hybrid champions, but the problem is that the things they counter don't really exist. In theory, hybrid champions counter enemies that build defense because as a hybrid damage dealer I can build equal parts AD and AP and scale off both, whereas defensively you kind of have to choose one of those to stack against. Therefore if your enemies build defense heavily in one direction or the other (because hybrid defensive items are kinda rare)  you just build hybrid and still do decent damage because they're only resisting a large portion of a part of all the damage you're doing, instead of a large portion of the whole chunk. But this kinda only works on abilities where the ability itself scales well off of both AD and AP, like Eve's Q, and Poppy's Q and not much else. Honestly most champs that can build hybrid like {{champion:131}}  or {{champion:21}}  have an \"either or\" choice to make depending on which abilities they have that you want to emphasize, in which case anybody building defense against the ability you \"chose\" is still gonna shut you down. Building hybrid also has the lazy bonus of not having to react to your opponent;s build paths, which you should be doing anyway, but if you scale off AD and AP well, just build hybrid and don't worry about it.\n\nI really like your idea though about one affecting utility and the other damage, that way you could choose to either be a support, or another damage dealer or be decent at both. Honestly the whole \"mages as supports\" meta that's been going on since around the end of season 3 is at least proof that some people would try it.\n\nSide note: I feel like if {{champion:28}} had better AP scaling on her ult, she'd arguably be the best true hybrid champ in the game (meaning she benefits most from the existing hybrid items), but people seem to only want to build her one way or the other, and Riot seems completely unable to solve or identify what her role is so their best solution is to scrap her completely and rebuild her from the ground up. This is really sad to me because I feel like she's one of the most versatile and fun champions in the game.

His passive would take a % of all damage dealt and damage received ( before resists) and convert it into an energy bar that can be used for either offense or defense. the % ratio would decrease as the game progresses based on ap/ad/resists to reduce scaling and keep the passive gains controlled. this function allows him to feed his passive for damage or heals and gives purpose for him to tank and/or deal damage without relying on either.\n\nhe would start with a well of 250 \"power\" which would increase by 250 every ~ 4 levels, maxing at 1000 at 16. His basic skills will only empower by 250 \"power\" unless using his ultimate. his ultimate will allow a burn of 750 \"p\" on first basic and 500 on the next skills. Ult deactivates after 10 seconds or 3 seconds after having used every skill once, but not exceeding the base 10 seconds. Ultimate increases  defence, health, ap and ad by acceptable amounts. 10 second window or upon using all skills once keeps the steroid from being over powered by giving him a choice on how to make use of it. either by using it for the steroid of for the skill empowerment for additional damage and support.\n\nfrom there he would have the option to target enemies with certain skills to deal additional damage or cc and target allies to provide a heal that would function as a health battery. ex. 1 ally in 250 units receives 100% health, 2 allies in 250 receives 50%. further delineation could go so far as to make the pool heal champs to an = % before raising them both, which could provide additonal support to those dying. he would not be allowed to heal himself. life steal and spell vamp only.\n\n80% of his skills would have little to no base scaling and would rely entirely on his build with bonuses applied after reaching benchmarks. as an example for every 50 ad his ad ratio increases by .15 or such. same goes for ap. this increases either his healing or damage ratio.\n\nthis allows a melee to deal damage, and provide support to the team through cc and heals at the cost of forcing him to be in melee range for it and to potentially sacrifice itemization that would make him truly tanky. he has to survive team fight burst but only long enough to be useful. hence the passive that feeds both on damage and defence. long team fights mean more utility, but high tank stats mean low quality skills. poorer heals, damage, and potentially cc.\n\nexample of team heal. 100 health at lvl 4 + {100 x .2 base ratio^increased by .05 per 50 ap(\"p\" spent [0-750 during ultimate first cast])\n\nlets say with lvl 4 and 200 ap that becomes a 130 HP heal without his passive. with an ultimate first cast it becomes a single shot  nearly a 1k Hp heal battery for nearby allies, prioritizing lowest health first.  but at the cost of losing the first shot benefit on other skills. his passive will be intended to be used every time he uses the skill on an ally, so the passive bonus can make it range between a 150-400hp battery without ulting. making it decent unless in large crowds with = health unless someone is clearly lower that will receive priority. cooldowns and gameplay would clearly come into play as well to account for the strength of the skill as well.\n\nbut like i said. i need to refine my numbers, but that's the verbal outline of the plan.","replies":[]},{"poster":"General Veers","date":"2015-04-16T16:29:37.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a long time Kayle main, I love hybrid champions and think they're the most interesting in terms of strategy and versatility.\n\nHere's a link to my best attempt at a true hybrid champion: [My Yasuo Rework](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/f4w4pIu9-my-yasuo-rework).  It's pretty similar to what you're talking about here (AD for dmg, AP for utility).\n\nThe thing about hybrid champions is that to make them work, you need to be able to offset the opportunity cost of stat multipliers.  Things like crit, dcap, cinderhulk, and AR/MR penetration scale really efficiently for specialists.  \n\nWhat this means is that your hybrid champion should have bonus penetration built into their kit someplace.  They should have weak base stats and strong scaling to make your build actually matter.  Their utility needs to be strong enough to make someone actually want to forgo their damage build (I think it needs to be something OP like intervention or windwall).\n\nThey should have a farming mechanism - the fun of these champs is that they're choose your own adventure, where items actually matter, and a big part of whether or not you win is if you adapted your build to the situation at hand (more so than on other champs).

I don't know how to quote different people in one post, and I don't want to make several replies and clutter the thread, so I guess I'll try to throw everything into here.\n\nA couple of people brought up the issue of balancing AP vs AD builds would just lead to people picking one of the two extremes. This problem is addressed in my second comment.\n\nThe AP utility should have high scaling, but be soft capped. What this means is that AP stacking should work similar to how Armor/MR stacking does, but not as heavily punishing. With this soft cap you can feel like you've unlocked a big portion of your AP potential by buying a small amount like 150-200. The soft cap shouldn't be so rough as to discourage leaning towards AP completely. This eliminates Death Cap etc as a necessary piece to get the most out of the AP scaling, but still leaves it as an option.\n\nNow for AD. As stated in my previous post skill scalings should be based off of total AD instead of bonus AD. Doing this will lessen the gap between pure  AD and Hybrid. Basically the hybrid isn't being punished for not stacking AD because he's passively adding damage to his skills through his base AD, while it will deter people from going straight AD because they could be building defensively, or hybrid and still gain damage. The scaling should probably be moderately high so you can feel rewarded for buying some AD. This is okay because someone who builds pure AD is sacrificing ALL of his utility for damage, not some, or most of it. The base values for the utility will start with 0 and rely completely on itemization to unlock it.\n\nWith these two measurements in place I feel that it removes AD or AP as options to be the dominant build, but leaves them open as paths to fill specific role if needed.\n\n\nThere were a couple of suggestions and notes that I agree with as well. Someone mentioned that hybrid itemization needs to be better. I completely agree. The build path for a champion built from this skeleton shouldn't rely completely on the only three hybrid items we have in the game. We probably won't see one until a true hybrid champion is made though.\n\nSomeone else also suggested that there be a bonus reward for keeping your AP and AD close together. This is a really cool idea that I'd like to see happen. It would probably open up more build paths that specifically focus on achieving this too. Someone might feel encouraged to buy some strange items just because it lines up with their stats perfectly if the bonus is rewarding enough.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PRØTØSS","date":"2015-04-16T17:26:33.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:72}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"BerserkGoldfish","date":"2015-04-16T17:10:50.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"shyvana also benefits from a hybrid build, \n\nlike Triforce, GB, Liandrys, Hydra, fire cape or spirit visage, mpen boots","replies":[]}]}
