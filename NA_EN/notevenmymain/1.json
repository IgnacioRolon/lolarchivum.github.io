I expected Sunfire Cape to take priority over Cinderhulk until Cinderhulk's damage eventually passed Sunfire's, and then it'd switch. Instead what I got was 80+ damage ticks. Try it for yourself. Things to note when you do try is sometimes the damage does not occur at the same time, so you'll get rapid smaller ticks, and also don't forget to autoattack so that Cinderhulk begins stacking.","replies":[]}
