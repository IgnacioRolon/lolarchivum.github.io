So i've just seen a video where somebody used a so called custom skin. So i looked it up and found out that there is a lot of custom skins, before i try any of them, i just want to know. Is it against the rules of League? or is it okay to use Custom downloaded skins?","replies":[{"poster":"XxxLumberJackxxX","date":"2016-09-07T12:06:20.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You wont get banned as long as it only shows up on YOUR screen. If it unlocks skins that show up on everyone's you are violating terms.\nMost of the custom skins follow that rule but I dont use them bc I can't be bothered.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xXxAlta√ØrrxXx","date":"2016-09-07T08:59:26.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ye, ofc u can use it. A lot of LOL streamers are doing it. For example custom chromas are much better quality then Riot's.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-06T22:29:55.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Custom skins and the programs that offer them are a pretty gray area and could potentially be a safe thing to do, or could be a terrible mistake. Because Riot doesn't develop these skins or programs that install them, I cannot greenlight or say what's okay to use. Basically, anything outside of what's offered in the game itself is a **try at your own risk** type of deal. We do not officially support or suggest making any changes to your game files outside of what's offered in the game.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}
