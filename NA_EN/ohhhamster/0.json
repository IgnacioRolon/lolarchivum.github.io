Yes I've tried running admin, yes I've deleted the launch folder... \r\n\r\nThe problem is this. I reinstalled league because it kept doing the thing where I would click \"Okay\" because it needs an update or whatever. It wasn't working so I'd click \"restart\" and it would close and I'd do this over and over. So i reinstalled league. Now I have a similar problem... League will open up and say \"The Client Update Has Begun\" when it already updated. So I click \"Launch\" and the client just closes and that's it. So I tried this over and over and it's not working. What do I do? I would like to play League again.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-13T21:36:59.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When the client is updating, you may need to setup your permissions again to ensure that the updated client can access and update the game files. Run through this [**permissions guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) and you should be able to get that update going.

Let's try a bit of a different approach. Refer to the image below, and following the arrows to delete 1 specific file and run a different one. Let me know if this works better ^_^!\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/d6976e1b060022dede938ce98d031890.png","replies":[{"poster":"ohhHamster","date":"2017-08-15T04:00:30.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This one worked!
