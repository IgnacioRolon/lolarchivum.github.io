I feel it should be significantly higher due my specs and i should be able to play with 144 fps the whole time but it simply drops for seemingly no reason.\r\nLooking at my gpu during gameplay and it's usage is only 25%~ even with framerate uncapped.\r\nI'd love to know if there was a way to get higher fps so i can not have drops, and it's only league as i can play witcher 3/watch dogs 2/ etc on ultra settings with good fps but league is still poor performance.","replies":[{"poster":"Alistair the Red","date":"2016-12-16T02:24:59.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"(Not a solution, just my 2 cents)\nJust lock it at 60 or 80 tbh.
