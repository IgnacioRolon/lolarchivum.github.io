I dc'd multiple times bc of it, and had a rather poor score. Check the chat logs, check the data or whatever, but I managed to get back into the game. After the game I was shafted with 5 low priority queue games by LeaverBuster for something I had no control over. I used to have a problem about leaving games, but if you check my match history that was quite a while ago, a few months at least. This was a genuine internet issue that is NOT a common occurance for me, yet I am being punished by the LeaverBuster system for it. Is there a way that I could get the low priority queue games off of my account without suffering through the process of waiting them out?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-17T00:03:28.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely get where you are coming from.  It definitely sucks to be penalized for something beyond your control.  Keep in mind though that we never punish for a single leave because we know that things happen that prevent you from playing.  From looking into your account however, it seems that you have AFK'd/DC'd several games in the past that has raised your Leaver Level fairly high.  Because it is so high, even a single game now will cause penalties until you play enough games over a period of time without an AFK/DC.  After a long enough time, your Leaver Level will decay all the way back down to zero.\n\nI hope this helps explain things a bit better.  If you still have some questions, feel free to reply back and let me know!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Clive129","date":"2016-05-16T20:50:08.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LeaverBuster FAQ:\n\n\"CAN YOU TAKE ME OUT OF LOW PRIORITY QUEUE?\nNo. We will not take your account out of low priority queue under any circumstances.\"","replies":[]}]}
