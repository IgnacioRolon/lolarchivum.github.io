I have screenshots of the aftergame lobby which I feel should be sent to riot so that this player can be punished. Where should I send these screenshots?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-23T00:51:01.570+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best step you can take is to actually report the player in the end-of-game lobby and explain the behavior he was exhibiting in the after-game chat.  This is the best method for us to track these types of players and punish accordingly.\n\nI know you want to take that extra step to make sure justice is served, but if this player continues to do this, he will get a full serving ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2016-06-23T12:39:31.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol I like the way you put that \n\n> he will get a full serving ^.^\n\nhttps://cdn.meme.am/instances/55285400.jpg","replies":[]}]}]}
