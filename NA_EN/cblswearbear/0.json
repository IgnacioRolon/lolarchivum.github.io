Minions would freeze, would walk in place, and I would be dead before I could see anyone actually on the screen.  All of this while my ping stayed at a very playable 70-80.  Never once did the ping rise to over 80 and yet the lag was unbearable.  \r\n\r\nThe friend I was premade with also had the exact same issues.  I restarted league client, and had trouble logging in, got a connection error as well.  Now, when setting up a custom game, even adding bots to the list is lagging like crazy and takes 5 seconds to actually register.  This is the first time I have had this issue and it cost me a ranked win and loss of LP.  \r\n\r\nSpeed tests and everything on my end are perfect, this is only happening with the league client. What is going on and is there a way to get a loss forgiven for that?  Its still happening hours later btw.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-07T18:27:40.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Loss forgiven is a system that is used when there are network issues on Riot's side.
