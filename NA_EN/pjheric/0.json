Why didn&#039;t they buff his passive MR shield and increase base damage? Did they even see Galio as a tank?\r\nJust posting some questions to think about him. He is an interesting case to explore and I think we can learn a lot from his failure.","replies":[{"poster":"Enderspider","date":"2018-02-04T20:19:30.196+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"what happened was, old galio was a tanky ap champion that countered ap champions but still dealt a bit of damage. with his rework they gave him a tank kit, but they wanted a similar playstyle... which doesnt work with a tank kit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2018-02-04T19:23:10.478+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot wanted to create a tank/ap hybrid.  Someone who could do damage but was also fairly tanky.\n\nPlayers got a hold of him and immediatly realized that he was way more impactful building either full tank of full damage and had fun with both.  Riot looked at that and said \"no fuck you, we designed him to be a hybrid so you are going to play him like one goddamnit\" and procceeded to nerf/buff/change him while players kept doing the same thing.  This led to a phase of op tank galio, a phase of op ap galio and then the current phase of well shit he kinda sucks at both now.","replies":[{"poster":"pjheric","date":"2018-02-04T20:19:29.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot did try to force a gameplay style to players... Any effective changes you have in mind?\nHe is in a mediocre, \"jack of all trades, master of none\" state. His early game is way to weak and can't function as an effective tank. He can't really make up when he is behind, and full damage results in no tankiness, which he needs to survive. He can't deal any damage when he goes full tank, however, and this results in something like an overnerfed Camille situation.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sex Crazed Eve","date":"2018-02-04T18:56:00.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's kinda mediocre at everything lol","replies":[]}]}
