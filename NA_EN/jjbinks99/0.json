Is there somewhere I can find the math behind all this? am I just unlucky or did I miss something I am supposed to do with the honor capsules?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TrueEL","date":"2017-08-12T13:02:33.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think so. I guess it is random how you get it:\n\"**Starting at level three**, Honor Capsules start to drop as well.
