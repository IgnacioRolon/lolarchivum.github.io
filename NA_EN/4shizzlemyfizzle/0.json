Due to not having  access to the email account that is associated with my account the recovery process became complicated. I followed the advice of riot support via opening a new ticket while logged out so that the thread we were communicating in wouldnt be seen by the person with access to my account.(i assume that is why this was suggested.) After some time i found the account unable to be logged into, i assume this is also due to the investigation of my account to prevent further access to it via myself or my assailant. \r\n\r\nDespite my providing, what i deem, more than adequate information, including screenshots of gift prompts, post game screens, credit card info, a picture of my photo ID, plus more than 75% of the suggested information on the account recovery page, i have still yet to hear so much as a \"we are looking into your problem for you\" from riot. I left an alternate e-mail, a phone number and still nothing.\r\n\r\n As a member of this game, and customer of riots for approximately 4 years this is my first account hacking issue and am wondering if this is standard timing/protocol/effort of riot studios? As someone who has invested close to if not over $2000 into this game you can see how there is a little bit of sting to losing this account.\r\n\r\nI really don't want to have to start fresh but have reluctantly started to, hoping this situation will be resolved, the summoner name of the account in question is betweendaeye, hopefully someone from riot can get me some insight or a little piece of mind?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-14T04:16:30.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look at the most recent ticket you submitted, which is almost this entire post word-for-word.
