And I am starting to get mad at you laners.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"The jungler has changed.\nYou should have noticed by now.\n\nIt is not my duty to win your lane for you and not my fault if you lose it.\nThere is a limit to how much I can gank.\nAnd there's a limit on what I can spend on pots trying to make it happen.\nNot to mention that I am already throwing half my money away into wards.\nWith the Smite buff on \"Wraiths\" (ward sight) I am already spending much more money to keep vision coverage.\n\nIf 2 or even 3 lanes are losing I will do my best to gank. But I can't stay at an appropriate level AND gank as much as their mid and jungle do combined.\n\nPlease, before flaming me for not ganking enough - check the enemy jungler and double check wether their mid might be the one ganking you.\nI am just one person.\n\nAnd for lord's sake - especially on early levels STOP TAKING MY CAMPS, I'm begging you. It will not only be you who is behind but me even more.\n\nAnd once I am behind you won't be the only one taking my camps, but so will the enemy jungler since I can't fight him any longer.\n\nAnd for lord's sake, before ping spamming how \"low\" your opponent is, check how low I am. Especially when you request a level 3 gank right of the bat.\nNot to mention that there is a significant amount of popular midlaners who're close to ungankable (Zed, Fizz, Blanc)\n\nI simply don't have the time anymore to spend 45 seconds in your bush. Clearing the new camps takes longer and falling behind early on equals a free drake for the enemy team.\n\nSo, please  stop with the freaking flaming until you have tried the new jungle yourself.\nThis is not season 4 anymore.","replies":[]}
