Currently I jungle Trinity AD Eve at  Plat 2 Elo with a 63% winrate.\n\nThe PBE change: &quot;Now deals up to 160/280/400 (+ 40% AP) magic damage based on  how healthy targets are from 15/20/25% (+ 1% AP) current health in magic damage.  Cooldown lowered to 130/110/90 from 150/120/90&quot;\n\nWhile i totally understand the intention this change, I feel like it makes a big mistake of overlooking the AD Eve path.\nIn my eyes both builds should be viable, AP and AD.\nAD Eve has less burst, but features great DPS thanks to her E and allows a safer overall clear as well as more utility.\nAP Eve features more burst, but noticeably lower DPS mid-to lategame and weaker early jungling  (=less objective control).\n\nWhat the ult change does is essentially buffing AP Eves burst - but at the cost of significantly nerfing AD Eve&#039;s lategame potential against any character that is not a glass cannon. This is hurting AD Eve exactly in a spot where she&#039;s good at. I don&#039;t think that any nerfs to AD Eve are justified at her current state.\n\nI&#039;m in favor of leaving her ultimate as it is or at least adding an AD ratio to the new ultimate.\n\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Mistress Shyvana","date":"2016-08-09T23:15:02.698+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I  completely agree with you I enjoy that eve has two paths depending on what she needs. Removing AD scaling son her Ultimate is a bit harsh. Will the change is welcome she should stay unique as one for the few hybrid champs with dual scaling son everything and an AD or AP build","replies":[]},{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-08-09T23:07:39.486+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who played eve before she was pidgeonholed into bruiser/hybrid, I am a bit unsympathetic to AD eve nerfs.","replies":[{"poster":"Kowe The Ewok","date":"2016-08-09T23:11:00.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree. AD Eve is much more fun than AP Eve to me - since she's a lot less binary than AP Eve. There's a variety of paths you can take which can all be viable depending on the matchup.\n\nIt simply that she (AD Eve) is less easy to learn than other junglers even though her kit looks pretty straight forward at first glance and people fail to recognize this, thus end up underperforming (giving the false impression that she's bad when she's not).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ravenhale","date":"2016-08-09T23:00:30.648+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was hoping they would make the simple change of current health to maximum health.","replies":[{"poster":"Kowe The Ewok","date":"2016-08-09T23:05:45.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Either this or adding minium damage like other ultimates have it would've been completely fine.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Bearded Bard","date":"2016-08-09T23:29:30.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also play Eve both ad and ap and I'm digging the changes. Before it was really only good to initiate fights, which as a squishy assassin isn't always the best thing to do.

She'll completely lose her dueling power vs bruisers.

This change gives it straight damage that can actually kill at low HP, where her previous version of her ult couldn't do that.","replies":[{"poster":"Kowe The Ewok","date":"2016-08-09T23:27:48.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her previous ultimate was significantly stronger when used on high Hp targets.\nSince her ult is her only inbuild means of slowing enemies it currently is and still be best be used early in the fight to catch up to her target.\nSame goes for the shield: It's better for going inr ather than for cleaning up.\n\nThe reasoning you suggest is counterintuative to every other aspect of how her ultimate works.\n\nOn another note:\n% Hp allows her to take on more tanky enemies and not pidgeon hole her into farming squishies: Others assassins already do that and are far better at it.","replies":[]}]}]}
