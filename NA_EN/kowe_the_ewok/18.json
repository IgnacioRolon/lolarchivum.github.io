If a champion was truly terrible then you wouldn't see pro's be able to do so well with them, as if they were just another random pick.  \n\nSo while Cass wasn't necessarily the bane of other midlanes preceding her rework, her kit and play style when successful; did still promote her bad qualities.

Especially given in equal skill levels someone like Voyboy can turn on most other mids without too much of a problem.\n\nI do (honestly) think you probably can come up with a change to Cass that is actually healthy, but it's important to remember everything comes with trade offs, and being able to Q W a wave, and then Qing an enemy champion while receiving little to no counter attacks.

If she cannot, she is *not playable.* She was not dominating matches, she was not ruining solo queue nor running rampant in competitive play. She was doing nothing to demonstrate her supposed toxicity. One day Riot decided she was toxic, simply by saying \"guys this is toxic k.\" \n\nShe was dominating Treeline, sure, but Riot has repeatedly said they don't give a flying fuck about Treeline balance, so why should that have had any effect on their decision? That was her only sin: too strong on Treeline. \n\nThe rework was not only unnecessary but left her in an unplayable, horrid state that is neither fun nor compelling.

Similar rantings could be said about every champion you listed except maybe heimdinger and viktor.

She just needs to W herself, place a Q on you, and then when she has the MS advantage to run ahead and then ult you if you follow, she made it so you always had to bring a friend to kill her. Other champions to get away have to blow as much as an ult or a high cd ability. Her type of skill set and play style that existed before was simply remnants of the environment Cass needed to be in t survive that context.

If you solve dull farming, fixed item tree will remain.\nbefore a rework, players had lots of choices. {{item:3003}} {{item:3151}}  , {{item:3003}} {{item:3116}} (slow for hyper ADC) , {{item:3174}} {{item:3089}}  ,{{item:3007}} {{item:3089}}  or {{item:1076}} {{item:1076}} {{item:3151}}  ( pull on a power curve extremely early time)\n\n I could have strategic selection under any circumstances, it was real team playing and made me exciting. BUT current passive impels me to buy only Tear and Deathcap. If you didn't buy those, It provides an excuse for reversing. However, before rework, I achieved hyper carry many times with Liandry and Rylai.\n Moreover the worst thing is happen in a position. Cassiopeia was also used as a supporter. her role was a guardian for hyper ADC in weak early game or anti carry like Zyra. Even for jungler. but now fiexd item tree and power curve spoiled everything.\n The possibility of position, item and skill tree was the most charming point of Cassiopeia.\n\n If you don't like lane bully, please take other selections. Think about Caitlyn, she was lane bully also hyper carry in lategame, so you adjusted AS not DMG. (If you cut off a half DMG, she would never beat anyone. BUT you do this for Cassi.)\n\n I have moderate idea for cassi. (for not lane bully. just hyper carry, lots of possibilities)\n\n Passive: Stack + evolve QWE like Khazix OR Deadly cadence base but each step has unique effect like a dragon buff.\n\n* Q evolve : CD reduction 0.5 sec other skills when she spike twinfang to poisoned enemy(like Ryze), addtional high MS very short time(0.1~0.2 sec) when she hit an enemy\n* W evolve :  mana vamp twice.\n* E evolve : CD reduction from 0.9 to 0.5 (poisoned enemy)  skill vamp.\n\nNoxious Blast \n* Damage: 75/115/195/235(+0.8 ability power)\n* Movement speed: 20%\n* Cooldown: 4 ~ 5 seconds \nnot lane bully but open possibility as a supporter. high CD prevent another Ziggs from forking but ensure great AOE damage when she gush out  E rush(high risk high return). addtional MS can solve cassi's old problem(concern about Bruiser) and it looks like a real snake.\n\n Miasma \n* Damage per second: 25/35/45/55/65(+0.2 ability power)\n* mana vamp except for minion(for jungling or dragon choice not lane stability)\n\nTwin Fang \n* Damage: 50/85/120/155/190(+0.55  ability power)\n* Utility: Now refunds its mana cost plus an additional 3% of Cassiopeia's total mana when it kills a unit.\n* Base CD is 0.9~1.0. (remember Caitlyn)\nCD can keep her power from bullying in early game, but save fun e rush  in late game.\n\nWould you mind referring to my idea?","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Queen Viper","date":"2014-11-28T20:12:26.808+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> A big part of it was to curb the oppressive lane bully pattern....\n\nWould like to point out that again, she hasn't been a \"lane bully\" since the Season 2. -.-","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Main Swain","date":"2014-11-28T18:03:31.210+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"don't bother, they've taken over.  anything that isn't raging about Cassiopeia being \"horrible\" gets downvoted and raged at nomatter what the comment, even if its something like this and its promising cass changes in the future.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BallisticMouse","date":"2014-11-28T16:15:06.813+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cassiopeia was already not a great mid-laner for the most part, you made her worse rito.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blkninjar87","date":"2014-11-28T14:41:58.195+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cassiopeia has no reliable cc.

The bottom line is that Riot made her that wasy specifically to reduce her power curve during the first half hour of a match. If the enemy team has a Cass, it means they have a severe disadvantage where the midlane is concerned. If your team fails to capitalize on it and lets her survive well enough to hit her power curve in the late game, it's no one else's fault but you and your teammates'. It works both ways as well, the current Cass player is rewarded for surviving until the lategame with a boost in what can be done with the champion. Is it the healthiest way to do it? Maybe not. But it's fulfilling a purpose, and even if some people don't like it compared to how she used to play, there are plenty of people who will learn to play her, compensating for her shit early game, just to take advantage of that late game power spike.","replies":[]}]}
