And holy shit manaless champs just all rose a couple extra tiers because of the nerfs.\nAs long as there are manaless champs, as well as the newer champs that barely use any mana whatsoever, everyone needs to be able to have matching resources available.

I honestly would enjoy it if building high mana and low mana regen, as well as vice versa, were both viable options, as well as building neither and focusing on max damage instead.  If riot actually used mana how it was supposed to be used, it would actually be healthier for the game.  Champions with a lot of regen and cooldown should do less damage, champions with a lot of mana should be able to stay in lane longer, and champions with neither should have to rely on one or two spell rotations to get a kill.\n\nAs it is now, champions who build neither mana nor mana regen consist of those who don't use mana, and leblanc.  I don't think any champ really builds a lot of mana and little regen except maybe kassadin.  And now, practically every mid needs to build regen now to compete with those who don't need it.

Both nerfing the strong champions and buffing the weak champions help balance the game. However, overbuffing a champion will make them an instant pick/ban and ruin most games while overnerfing a champion will simply make them fall out of play and have little effect on games. While I agree that riot doesn't have to always nerf, I see little reason why they should take a buff first approach when a nerf first approach is so much more efficient. Small buffs can be used as fine tuning after the problematic champions have been fixed with more significant nerfs.\n\nCompletely disagree that nerfing should be the go to choice. Let us just look at ADCs and the balance there. In most cases the ADCs over the years have received many more nerfs than buffs, I would go as far as to say double the amount of nerfs to buffs. \n\nI feel this has caused some of the problems in the jungle as well, if not impacted the jungle more so (same in mid really where immobile mages were all but pushed out or pushed to supports) where Riot nerfed so....many....junglers but didn't touch Lee Sin aside from a few tickles, so now they really need to nerf Lee when what they should have done was balance and not simply nerfing. I mean if you had a dent in the side of your car but the other side looked really nice and waxed and shiny....would you buff out the dent and have it touched up or take a hammer to the nice side so they look equal?\n\nMy point is, they shouldn't take a do either thing first approach, which I think is THE problem is they have shown a nerf first approach for years when what they should do instead of playing whack-a-mole is look at the situation as a whole, what is making that champion strong, what is making a champion weak and not just \"This champ is strong buff it\" because that imbalances everything else, but due to E-Sports now they seem to feel they have to act faster and at least from my own perspective (as I won't speak for anyone else) it seems they rush things sometimes, and I can give lots of examples but that is for another post.\n\nIf you only continue to nerf and nerf and give \"small buffs\" eventually everyone will just be the same level of weak and right back to the same level of bad balance as before since you just nerfed to a reset that makes everyone overall weaker but the same champions are right back to where they started.","replies":[{"poster":"ChargeItDownMid","date":"2015-01-04T18:54:21.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Xonra","date":"2015-01-04T20:39:48.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=haaaaaaaalp,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jsnXBEuE,comment-id=00100003000000000000000000000001000000000000,timestamp=2015-01-04T18:54:21.713+0000)\n>\n> Why would everyone go back to the same level of bad balance? The whole point is that you only nerf the strong champions and only enough so that they are are on par with the average champion. Obviously, that means that tier one champions such as lee sin would get harder nerfs than their 1.5 champions such as pantheon who in turn would get nerfed harder than a tier 2 champion such as rengar. Only the top champions would be overall weaker while the mid and bottom tier champions will stay around the same power +/- a few small buffs.\n> \n> Also, you have to realize that it takes significantly longer to buff champions than it does to nerf champions for the same payoff. If riot screws up and overbuffs a champion, they will ruin every game. If riot screws up and overnerfs a champion, they will fall out of favor and effect close to no games. It is extremely inefficient to do another approach besides the nerf first when the game is as unbalanced as it currently is (and leads to problems such as lee sin being overpowered for 2 years because riot refuses to nerf fast enough).\n\nThe problem is that when you have say three champs that are on top, those three get nerfed, so another three take their place (this is an example not taken from a specific instance) then riot nerfs those three, and another three pop up, and again nerfed, well now we get back to the original offenders ( looks at the past 2 years of balance and you will see that the cycle tends to start with certain overbearing champions then nerfed etc and it eventually goes back to them). The probably is because champions are nerfed more than buffed you eventually end up with the same champions in those strong positions, except they are weaker than they were previously and the others are too, so you not only didn't succeed in overall balance you weaken the entire pack.\n\nThat is the point I was trying to make it that you can't simply nerf nerf nerf sort of buff nerf nerf because then you end up with a completely different problem.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JunkÎ¿","date":"2015-01-03T17:35:14.897+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Then why are Alistar and Zilean not nerfed?

I get it on pretty much anyone who needs AP and CDR, and often I get two of them by the end of the game.

Or one that reduces it by say 15%(12.5% may be more realistic). The state of tanks is probably the best example of how dull the itemization in this game is. They're very bad at making items better in different situations while doing a similar job. I would say Bork vs BT for ADC's is about as close as it gets. But even then that's still highly decided on the champion. (favor the AS/active or higher AD for abilities). I say it too much probably. But Dawngate had a great itemization. You never felt forced into an item outside of maybe a core 2 items in most cases. Really is a shame that game got dropped. Sure there was always an optimal build. But it wasn't a chore to work around changing it if the game called for it.","replies":[{"poster":"Centuros","date":"2015-01-02T01:17:47.997+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":">Endless mana was a problem.\n\nTell that to all of those manaless jerks, some of which have resets (which would be much more balanced if they could potentially run out of mana to pentakill your team one after another).","replies":[{"poster":"Cindikle","date":"2015-01-02T01:42:44.105+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":10,"body":"They will get balanced as needed. The mana problem was with mana. If this problem in S4 meant mana-less champions needed more power to compete they will get nerfed after being Op in S5. And this often means to be talking about Yasou and Zed. \n\nYasou's kit is overloaded and needs a real look at. He was meant to have a weak early game for all of those stats. But never got that problem. Once he hits 3 he has all the tools he needs to survive in lane. \n\nZed for needs some power shift. But this has always been a problem with him. Has nothing to do with how long Anivia can run her R. I think part of his problem is the fact his W costs such little mana on top of having a mana restore function. While this combo generally isn't really that easy to do. It's not saintly hard either. Makes his WQ combo only cost 95 energy. On top of both of those abilities costing less energy per rank, and W restoring more energy per rank. Even worse. He restore this twice with both Q and E. Although this is generally only useable with his ult. \n\nRework this. Remove it as a combo for hitting with both to hitting with just E. This makes his WQ harass cost him 115 energy every time. Unless he can land his W on top of you for an E he will suffer. Another option could be that he has to land his W on you itself to regen the energy. Although this hurts the combo with his ult. \n\nI'm sure there are other options here. \n\nAlso both of these champions have sub-50% win rates. Zed's looks better at higher rankings, but overall is evened out. So while he is annoying, I wouldn't directly say he is OP unless you got counterpicked. (Zed would be a counterpick to Anivia.)  Zed is also very good at punishing mistakes.","replies":[{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2015-01-02T10:39:45.929+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless you're from the future, \"they will be balanced\" was the phrase thrown around for over 2 years.\n\n\nBelieve it or not, pre-nerf mana champions weren't close to being OP at all, because with even all that mana at their disposal, many still struggle to keep up with their manaless brethrens. At most they can just go toe-to-toe.\n\n\n\nAnd feel free to pretend you know about Swain. As a former main, I can tell you exactly how badly he needed all that mana regeneration, how these new changes aren't doing any favours with a champion that is barely played to begin with.\n\nAs for Anivia, because she totally needed those to her core most important items.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kowe The Ewok","date":"2015-01-01T23:56:32.930+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":3,"body":"What?\nOrianna a champion with little counterplay?\nHer ball has one of the slowest projectile speeds ingame...\n\nP.S.\nHow on earth is it balanced that a champion who just invested 5K gold (More than BotrK and LW combined) not in mana sustain gaining, barely any damage at all - still doesn't even have enough for a single teamfight?\nAt the sametime there are (near) ressourceless champion who have much better scaling and can build flat damage.\n\nSorry, but your understanding of \"balance\" seems more than just off....","replies":[{"poster":"Cindikle","date":"2015-01-02T00:18:45.335+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":12,"body":"Using E to move her ball for an ult is much faster than Q. Also if you're planning to use your Q for other abilities. It's best to throw it out, then wait for the CD to move it a shorter distance. She has many ways to work around Q's slow speed. \n\nOrianna is very safe in lane and brings massive teamfight utility. This is what I mean by she has little counterplay. She doesn't have to harass with Q. She can farm almost as safe as she wants. Orianna has some pricy abilities and low CD's(with her CD items which she will build). This leads to a lot of mana usage. Even the chalice couldn't honestly keep up with her mana costs if she was spamming abilities. But she would recover fast afterword. With 5k in mana regen you'll do the same.  Her only real downside is that her scaling is overall trash on anything but W. So if your team needs a high damage mid lanner, she isn't a strong pick. Her damage isn't weak, but it's nothing to brag about unless you're fed.\n\nIn short you built to recover your mana faster. Not equal the amount of costs. With 40% CDR she can use about 250 mana every 5 seconds, excluding her ulti. To counter this it would take a massive amount of mana regen. More than you can get with 5k. If you're using abilities non stop in a teamfight you will run out on her. There is no avoiding it. And there shouldn't be. But if you slow down you will start to gain it back quickly. Also remember that only her W has an increase in mana costs by rank(outside her ulti). Which is generally the first ability ranked. At level 9 with 40% CDR you can spend the mana that not even a level 18 could keep up with. \n\nDo you really think it's OK for her to keep this up with only 5k? If you invest any more your damage will suffer and it will take more mana to keep up.\n\n\nIf the problem is near--resourceless champions. Then they need the balancing. Most of those champions honestly have some heavy limitations as well. (Zed being the worst example for this.) Often this limitation is how they can poke at range. Kennen/Gnar probably the strongest in terms of that, and you want see them in mid. Zed and Yasou are the only two that really see play mid lane that i can think of. Zed has always been a kind of issue in this way. Safe early game for the level of power he gets at all points of the game. But he does have many counters from champions to items. Yasou has an overloaded kit, thus he's often seeing nerfs.","replies":[{"poster":"Sammystorm","date":"2015-01-02T00:30:56.919+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"the problem is that you never truly had infinite resources.
