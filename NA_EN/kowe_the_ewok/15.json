Several times.\nWhen ranged champions started to see play in the jungle you nerfed it. Instantly. Making it impossible.\n\nYou increased the cooldown of Smite. A Trailblazer nerf without any compensation and then a 2nd nerf followed. Okay, the 45s CD made it too strong in terms of objective control, but you didn't consider champs which relied on its sustain (CD went from 45 to 75s, health/mana gain unchanged).\n\nYou nerfed the other Smites, too. And why?\nBecause Warwick was able to break the maximum amounts of attacks per second with his ultimate at level 6 (thus exceeding even full-ASP-on-hit-build procs).\nAgain instead of tweaking the champion properly you nerfed the item.\n\nAnd just now you nerfed the cost of all T2 jungle items, heavily hurting champions which rely on them for their early clear.\n\nSeriously, each step taken in the last 2 month feels like a big contradiction:\n\n- Jungler shouldn't gank early. Thus we purposely destroy their early levels.\n- Oh look. Junglers are farming their jungle. We don't want them to farm their jungle. We increase the smite CD.\n","replies":[{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2015-02-01T15:08:12.384+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":5,"body":"idek\njungle is unplayable now","replies":[{"poster":"Knight SoIaire ","date":"2015-02-01T15:14:07.512+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":3,"body":"it is playabele \nbut we have 3 viable junglers","replies":[{"poster":"AbrahamBaconham","date":"2015-02-01T16:29:58.497+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":13,"body":"A massive exaggeration.","replies":[{"poster":"Knight SoIaire ","date":"2015-02-01T17:51:38.815+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":2,"body":"exageration? yes \nmassive? nope\n\nmany junglers got killed because if they clear they end up with too little hp to gank so they cant respond to opportunities","replies":[{"poster":"Marinaras Trench","date":"2015-02-01T18:29:49.962+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":28,"body":"{{champion:59}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:56}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:120}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:5}}","replies":[{"poster":"Old Man Teeto","date":"2015-02-01T19:35:54.096+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ability to clear jungle does not a viable jungler make.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JJ H0G","date":"2015-02-01T19:02:55.238+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":25,"body":"{{champion:106}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:48}} \n\nThey're all pretty damn good junglers too.

At its current state, jungling is near impossible if you're looking to make a difference in lanes.  Even when you do power farm in the jungle, the XP is still far behind lanes, meaning you're still level 4 or 5 while laners are hitting 6 or 7.  If you DO gank lane, if you fail, you're even further behind.  I've had to revert to my season 3 strat of taxing lanes for XP when one of my laners goes back to base just to stay EVEN.  On top of the stupidity of most junglers having their health depleted after the first 3 camps (thereby forcing them to return to base), they increased the cost of the jungle items, so now you can't even afford health pots on your return to the jungle.\n\nThe season 4 jungle may have had its problems, but at least I felt I was making a difference and could carry games easier if my laners fell behind, and I could play more than 3 viable junglers.  Now, I have to hope my laners at least go even with their counterparts, because I'm more reliant on THEM to get to where I need to be.  It's just another case of Riot placating to making their LCS more watchable, but making their game less playable.\n\nThanks Riot for making the one role I enjoyed playing and completely f*cking trashing it.
