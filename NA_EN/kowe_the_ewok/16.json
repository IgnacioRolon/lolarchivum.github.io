We see in LCS where that agenda has taken hold. We now see ADC champions in mid lane more than 80% of mages.

You can't count him as an ADC any more than you can count Quinn as one. Lucain's only in mid because he's kinda bad in bot, and because he does well against Kassadin (who is a relatively popular pick in top-tier). He still loses almost automatically to most mages.\n\n> Like nerfing all AP items, giving everyone free MR, adding Adaptive Helmet wasn&amp;#039;t destructive enough to DPS mages.\n\nAP items were nerfed a bit, and mages got better scaling, if I'm correct. Everyone _who didn't already have it_ (Most ranged champions and Yasuo) was given MR/level _to somewhat match armor/level_. You still get _less_ MR per level than you get armor per level.\n\n >We have ADC not only being played in the botlane, but also in the midlane (Lucien, Corki) and in the jungle (Twitch, Ezreal) and somehow you decide to nerf DPS mages out of the meta instead, every time they are remotely close to being viable.\n\nI've covered both Lucian and Corki's reasons for being in mid. I haven't seen a Twitch in the jungler for a _year_, now, because he's so locked into predetermined paths that he kinda just sucks in it. Any decent player can just interrupt his path and crush him. Ezreal has a 47% win rate in the jungle, and he's there because he _can't go anywhere else and succeed_. He has to settle for a goddamned 47% win rate at a role, because _every other way is worse_. He's objectively the worst ADC right now, has no ability to support (except for a tiny AS boost on his W, I think), doesn't really work in mid (too many mages there crush him), and..._might_ work top, I suppose? Maybe? Assuming he's against an immobile melee champion that isn't Nasus or Cho'gath, he might do fine. Maybe.\n\n> **Opposed to ADC DPS-Mages actually have counterplay.

Sure, they can't miss you with their primary source of damage, but they also generally have no CC to stop you from blowing them up (of the top 3 meta ones of Tristana, Twitch, and Draven, only Trist has reliable self-peel. Draven has a minor displacement that can be dodged, and Twitch only has a laughable slow). Most DPS mages, while they _can_ miss _sometimes_, tend to have a solid amount of CC. Cassiopeia in particular has her ultimate (can't be dodged if you're running at her) and her grounding, both things that can mess up any mage or assassin _big-time_.","replies":[{"poster":"Kowe The Ewok","date":"2017-09-15T19:27:44.940+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":13,"body":"1.)

Cassiopeia was a dominant pick there as was lucian. Both got a nerf althoguh I agree lucian's nerf was really gentle. I guess they want to see him being played now and then in worlds.\n\nNote that ADC is a broader class than just 'physical DPS ranged damage'. Lucian is very good mid, but sucks in the bottom lane. I think it's nice that this champ in particular found a home elsewhere. Perhaps, however, it's because other adcs are just too strong and it's easier to prey on the weaker midlaners. I think the adc+supp combo is a bit too strong atm. In ARAM this becomes VERY apparent. Facing an adc or a support without the other is fine. Facing both together, however, is just depressing. (By support I actually mean anything that can peel, not just the enchanters but also all tanks including a lot of toplaners and junglers). When there's an adc in your team, everyone with any sort of heal, shield or CC becomes a support to enable the ADC. I'm seeing this trend in LCS as well. It's less about midlane now, they'r basically the early game snowballers but later in the game, it's all about the adc. Toplane is just something to hold a lane for the early game and then protect the adc or disrupt theirs while functioning as a damage soak, trying to outlast the enemy frontline, because in no way are you actually going to KILL their ADC unless major missplays happen. A big part of this is the stronger support items that have more power put into buffing or protecting your team or just one member. Perhaps it's because mages got less damage and 40% CDR is ubiquitous. Maybe I'm exaggerating a bit because I think it has always been a bit like this, except when assassins were really strong and I didn't like those times. It's just a bit more pronounced now and small nerfs/buffs should happen to certain classes/items, not big ones.","replies":[{"poster":"Tik115","date":"2017-09-16T12:04:20.053+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"ADCs can find a new home in other lanes meanwhile if a support goes any other lane they're nerfed or reworked to shackle them to bot","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Poro","date":"2017-09-16T12:45:52.081+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot explained that already and I agree with their statement.
