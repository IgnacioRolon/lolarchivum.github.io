They nerfed the shit out of him, mildly reworked him, and now they're starting the nerf train again. Prepare your angus Kha'Zix players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GamersEye","date":"2014-10-15T06:25:16.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Reducing his base stats weakens his early game and makes it so when his shield isn't up he's a lot more vulnerable. That IS adding counterplay. What you're suggesting not a great idea, because it's his only way of getting a self knockup. And it really isn't the most problematic part of his kit. That was his retarded early game for the late game he had. Now that's been nerfed, his mid game has always been teetering on the edge of poor, and his late game is still pretty strong. I don't see a problem here.","replies":[]}]}
