I like the Idea of a shield on lee, but he should no longer be able to just wall jump with it. His 2nd cast can be somewhat Like sion's shield but instead of instant damage, it will raise His attack damage by a flat amount based on how much was left in the shield.\n\nHis E can stay relatively the same however the 1st cast no longer instantly reveals stealthed champs, however it does do a tremor pulse like rek sai's vision for as long as they are able to be hit by the 2nd cast. The 2nd cast will reveal and snare the target for .5 seconds and slow them for 3 seconds.\n\nHis R can Be kind of like a buff to his tremor vision. Passively It will increase his vision range by a small amount (not the tremor vision I mean his like 100 sight range vision. It's active will Make his tremor sense stronger for 10 seconds allowing enemies within a Fairly large range to be sensed (think warwicks E rank 5 here.) and an ally walking by can see them even if they are stealthed or in brush due to lee's ability to sense them.\n\nProbably needs work but Still could be intresting.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jakethenight","date":"2015-01-06T18:36:15.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His abilities and attacks give *only Lee Sin* vision of the enemy for 3 seconds.
