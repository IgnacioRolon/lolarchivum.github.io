For one, it still makes no sense for Cass to be singled out - what's wrong with Cass that isn't wrong with Ziggs's minefield, Morgana's soil or Malzahar's entire kit? For another, poison is arguably the MOST clear form of DOT there is: no other form of DOT puts a big mark above the head of the target. From experience it can be somewhat difficult to see a Ziggs minefield but Cass's poison spells both make distinctive noises, have easily recognised effects on the ground (green explosion versus *constant* purple cloud) and apply the poison mark. People who don't notice being hit by one of Cassiopeia's poisons do not afford to be catered too because they're the exact people who won't notice ANY DOT. If you have a problem with Cass's DOT then every other DOT spell in the game is an offender and every non-poison one is a worse offender at that.\n\nBut the most offending thing is how you've went about \"fixing\" what you see is wrong. You didn't try to add extra clarity to Cass's poisons, nor did you just get rid of them altogether (if you don't want DOT doing damage then there's no reason for it to exist, you should have just given her 4 burst skills rather than a kit that has 3 trash spells and 1 burst spell that does the work of the rest of the kit). Instead you kept her poison but purposefully made it worthless :/ I can't tell you how awful it feels to be told designers not only purposefully made the majority of your champion's kit weak to the point of being worthless, but lied about why they were doing it to boot.\n\nAnd in the end her gameplay is a thousand times less clear than it used to be anyway. If you see Cass you now need to worry about how many stacks she might have, what thresholds she's hit and how many Twin Fang poison debuffs she's managed to tag you with. If people couldn't deal with something as easy as a Miasma cloud before, how on earth do you expect them to deal with that PLUS working out what point of her passive she's at PLUS how many poison debuffs you've been hit with?

I... I don't think that that's a problem, since as you say, they're usually very strong visually and thus easy to see \"this shiny/big explosion did lots of damage\", which I agree is something that Cassiopeia... doesn't have, her visuals are somewhat piddly comparatively.\n\n> When you get edge'd by the hitbox of one of Cassiopeia's poisons, you tend not to notice, and then suddenly end up with a third of your HP gone without even knowing what happened or how to do better next time.

Should some sort of balance not be struck? I get that that's a gameplay thing, but with Cassiopeia her thematic and gameplay are intertwined. Her old self with high poison damage was really good because it felt like an underhanded diplomat of sorts, somebody waiting for the right time to pounce. But Cassiopeia makes that weakness herself, and it felt really nice and offered some fulfillment there.\n\n> W ends up being a bigger culprit than Q here, because it is effectively undodgeable, covers a large area, and lasts an exceptionally long time. \n\n... What? Miasma occupies a large area when you throw it out? I think that the fact that it slowly expands makes it not cover as large an area as it first seems (just looking at the min/max size numbers that is).\n\n>Basically, with the spell's readability, dodgeability, and duration profiles, it occupied a much lower portion of the opponents mind-space than it should have, given how threatening it actually was. \n\n>This is less a point of mastery (\"opponents should just learn that Misama is threatening\") than it was the spell dealing inappropriate damage given how it was applied. \n\n... What? I'm sorry, WHAT? What are you trying to say because I'm pretty sure that \"the spell [was] dealing inappropriate damage given how it was applied\" was not it. Do you mean that Miasma dealt too much damage for a thick cloud of purple fumes floating above the ground? Toxins tend to be small in the first place... or do you mean that Miasma, as an AoE DoT-applying field, was dealing too much damage? I really have a hard time agreeing with that seeing as it took place over **9 seconds**, and it is/was very easy to just walk out of it and take much less damage from it. But now walking out of it is (mostly) pointless because in lane it barely does more damage than one's HP Regen, since Cassiopeia HAS to build mana items so she can actually last hit enemies, which means no AP for her LOW AP scaling W.\n\n> The Twin Fang poison amp does add some under-the-hood stuff, which ***is*** a clarity cost, but ultimately it's a net gain.

Ok, sure! It's better if enemies know where Cassiopeia's damage is coming from.\n\n#Why can't it be \"because I got hit with this explosive green thing\" or \"I am standing in this purple cloud\" instead of \"Cassiopeia is walking up to me and throwing twin blades of energy that are about as large as her torso\"? It was pretty clear before that one took damage because you were hit by Cassiopeia's poisons.\n\n> That's the theory anyway, and it seems to be working out. The Twin Fang amp does some other stuff as well, like add optimizations to her trading patterns and emphasize the importance of using both of her combat ranges, but that's the clarity reasoning.\n\nShe has, effectively, one combat range, due to how weak her poisons are. It doesn't matter if she has 850 (or whatever it is) range on Noxious Blast when Noxious Blast alone does nothing. Noxious Blast followed with Twin Fangs followed with Noxious Blast does make that last Noxious Blast deal a fair amount of damage, but from the perspective of the Cassiopeia player it is still **damage from Twin Fangs** and not **damage from Noxious Blast**.\n\n> That all said, un-amped poisons might simply be doing too little damage as it stands, and the answer might be to add some poison power back there.\n\n**And everybody has been telling you that this is needed since this rework was pushed onto the PBE**.\n\np.s. I don't play Cassiopeia, and her DoTs were definitely easy to understand because \"I got hit with green thing so now I'm taking damage\". They were easy to appreciate for Cassio, too, as \"I hit my poison and I now see enemy health trickling away \\*evil cackle\\*\". I find the reason of \"Poisons are hard to appreciate\" to be entirely BS because anybody that things a strong DoT is weaker/less able to be appreciated just because it's a DoT and not burst (the difference is basically 0 if you're poking enemies) is somebody that needs to learn strategy games better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tendrian","date":"2014-12-10T20:16:30.933+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"Words can not describe how much I hate your design philosophy.\n\nSorry, but that's all I have to say.

Pre-rework it had a 3 second cooldown, post it has a 4 second (3 after passive CDR) -> 2.4 second cooldown on a 3 second poison.  \n\n> I see your point with surprise damage normal Q and buffed Q, but to make such combo she'd become vulerable.

'tis why few like the rework thematically-- Cassiopeia was the only one that had long-range DoTs that were skillshots (in a sense), and now she's like Ryze (spam-caster).\n\nBecause her Q damage is so small she's very weak because she has to get into range of her E to have any threat (yes she can disengage very nicely with Q/W still, but they don't do any damage so thematically it doesn't feel like Cassiopeia did\\*).\n\nWhich _basically_ reduces all of her ranges to that of her E, since in order for her to do damage she has to press E \n\n\\*imo Cassiopeia's old gameplay thematic was to melt through enemy HP bars over time, but have difficulty finishing the foes off without getting in close range (Twin Fang), which felt really clean to me.\n\nSorry, realized I dragged my opinion in but I can't get rid of it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tapu Fini","date":"2014-12-10T17:37:39.092+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Oh I'm sorry, you wanted to know how much damage you're going to take from DoTs?
