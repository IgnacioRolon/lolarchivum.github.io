The direction, slightly left or slightly right, is likely random if you are standing completely still.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"StOrmysLIVE","date":"2014-11-10T02:57:57.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know how for kalista you move click during your attack animation and it skips to that direction after? Is the same for draven, click the direction you want the axes to go, or if you are attacking in place,  the Axe will land directly next to you+off a few pixels in either direction","replies":[]},{"poster":"Abominate","date":"2014-11-10T02:18:35.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you hit something it moves in the direction you are running and in 1 of 3 distances away, far left, far right and center\nYou don't really know where it's going to go, but you must be aware of the direction you are running or it will fly further back/ forth then you want.","replies":[]}]}
