Not only can you turn off those options manually, but you can just turn off the sound altogether. Then I don't even think you can truly claim this hinders gameplay, there are visual cues for everything. Even looking at varus's q, sions/rek's ult; I could probably make the claim that hearing the abilities is a hindrance because it causes a subjective fear.\nWe payed $25 for a skin for a single champion, let us at least be able to control the best selling aspect of the skin or at least make it audible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Auryiel","date":"2015-02-25T22:21:40.357+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"lmfao I knew this skin would turn out to be a rip off\n\nAnd this coming from someone who enjoyed Spirit Guard Udyr even though I'd never played him before","replies":[]},{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2015-02-26T00:09:38.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't you turn the music up in the volume settings?

I just want to start by saying I love the skin, and you guys did an awesome job making it! But like other posters have said, the music is a bit quiet. I totally understand not wanting to overwhelm the other sounds in game, but I do think the option of making it even just a bit louder would be nice. I mean, after all the work put into making the stellar music for the skin, wouldn't it be better to allow the theme of the skin to shine? Some people just blast music in the background or with their phones anyways.\n\nIt is somewhat possible to work around with adjusting the sound sliders, but that gets a tad tedious to change every time she's in game or not.\n\nAgain, fantastic work on the skin, Sona is my favorite champ, and I'm really excited she got this ultimate.

I tried turning my in-game music to 100 and it was still incredibly difficult to hear.  I don't know if this is a bug or intended but I'm starting to regret my purchase.  The music was a huge part of the reason I bought the skin and I can barely hear it... \n> \n> I tried checking in the options for a DJ Sona specific volume bar but there doesn't appear to be one... \n> \n> Is there a problem with DJ Sona's music volume?
