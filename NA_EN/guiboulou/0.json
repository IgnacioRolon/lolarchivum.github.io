I am a Canadian, but I work part-time for an American company, which means I'm getting paid in USD for one of my two jobs. Therefore, I don't need to factor in the fact that banks take some money for currency exchanges and stuff. Basically, I have USD on my PayPal account and CAD in my bank account. As you may know, the Canadian dollar went back up considerably a little while back, and **I'm trying to figure out whether I should buy RP with my PayPal USD or my bank CAD**. However, I'm a languages person and maths stress me out. I would like someone to kind of fool proof my calculations.\r\n\r\nI'm using the $35 amounts for this. With 35 USD, you get 5000 RP. With 35 CAD, you get 3700 RP (I already added the \"bonus\" points). This means that you get roughly 142.85 RP per USD and 105.71 RP per CAD. Now, and this is the part where I'm scared of screwing up, 1 CAD = 0.82 USD currently. For what is equivalent to 1 CAD, but in USD (so for 82 US cents), you'd get roughly 117.14 RP. **In short, if I buy for 35 CAD of RP, I'll get a value of 105.71 RP per CAD, but if I buy 35 USD of RP, I'll get a value of 117.14 RP per CAD.** If I didn't mess up, that means I'm much better off buying in USD and we're kind of getting ripped off if we buy in CAD.\r\n\r\nCan anyone confirm that my calculations are correct or explain what is wrong with them? I wanna buy RP to get SG Ezreal and Ahri, but I'm a little short on money and I'd rather get the most RP possible for my money. Thanks!\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-07T20:28:13.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm that does look like some scary math.
