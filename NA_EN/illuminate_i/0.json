The only thing is, I am not sure how to really word my resume and cover letter. On the site, it says that they are looking for diamond level players. I haven't finished my placement matches, but I play with diamond level players sometimes in custom matches. At least, this one guy said that he was diamond and he ended up being silver. His wins were diamond though. I am afraid to play my placement matches, because I do not want to get placed in a low rank and not be able to get the job. Also, this one guys I know, played all ten matches, won 7, and still made bronze. On the site, it says that if you write a good cover letter and resume, they will still consider you. So, any help?","replies":[]}
