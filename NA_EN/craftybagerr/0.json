Note I had steady ping ~80 (not great but definitely not something caused by lag) so its not that. It hasn't effected me too bad but i have caught out when i should have been fine. I have no idea what to do to fix it.\n\n Things I've tried : restarting router &amp; computer. \n\nGive me suggestions please, anything.\n\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-22T16:30:59.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you could have an unstable connection reaching the game servers, and suffering from packet loss.
