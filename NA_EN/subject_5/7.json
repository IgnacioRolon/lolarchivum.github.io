But . . .\n\nThat kind of doesn&#039;t matter if it can&#039;t be applied to like, most of every ADC/Assassin that has hyper mobility. I played a bot game with non-mobile champions, and it was difficult to even use before the enemy seen me. Somebody with a brain that isn&#039;t a bot could just easily flash or even dash away. Why exactly does Eve have to be close enough to actually be seen to even use the ability? Most people can react in under 0.5 seconds to get away from her - the charm already informs people 2 times of where she is. Both vaguely and then universally . . .Z\n\nI know that you can dash with E while in shroud but you&#039;re already spotted and because you&#039;re a mid-end game assassin, the enemy Corki / Lucian just fucking fly swatted your ass.\n\nOverall? I love the new Eve. But holy fucking shit is she god damn awful at like, you know, being Rengar.\n\n**EDIT**\n\nGuys:\n\nCharm Reveals your local distance to an opponent when it is applied, even in stealth\nCharm reveals your UNIVERSAL location to an opponent after the completion of said charm\n\nSome people seem to think that it's like this big fucking mystery where Eve is when charm is going off, ROFL. I played against an 18/3 Eve in my Urgot jungle game - I could solo her even while I was behind as Urgot.
