And not in a good way either. Lemme ask ya man, are you black? If not, did you have a black friend who gave you a pass? Even if they did, that doesn't mean you can just run around saying it. In a game setting, no matter how mature, no company will accept racial slurs being thrown around at strangers.\n\nIn a work environment, you aren't going to run around using that word least you find yourself in the fast lane to unemployment. \n\nYou can't just go saying things like that because you want to, that isn't how the world works. I'm a white guy, 30 years old, with a black wife. You gain an interesting perspective on life married to someone of another race. \n\nLet me see if I can say it like she did. That particular word, was used as a form of oppression during the slave period. It was used to demean and bring down the spirit of our dark skinned brothers and sisters. Their use of it now, is their way of taking it as their own. For another race to use it, is equivalent of making it appear as if they (black people) are still worth as much as they were back then.\n\nAgain, can't remember everything correctly about what she said, but the point remains is that it isn't okay to be throwing it around, especially so if your reasoning is that the game is boring and it is your way of making it exciting. \n\nYou aren't making the game exciting... You're just being a racist ass.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2017-12-28T04:34:38.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol I don't think you should use the boondocks as a reference. You say \"even\" boondocks made fun of it, as if the boondocks is a fucking kid show. It's adult humor, made for adults. (Well, probably targets teens too, but hell, I was watching porn as a teen, and that's obviously not supposed to be targeted at teens) what I'm saying is, it's an edgy show. In game, under Riots rules, I don't know why you would think being edgy is safe. Maybe you should play a grown up game like you said, or you know, not play games at all if you're so grown up.\n\nYou really gotta learn to determine what is appropriate to say in what environments. That hood shit isn't popular everywhere. It may be in your environment, but when you step out of your environment (i.e. into Riot PC land) you have to adjust.\n\nAnyways, now you know. All you gotta do is not use that one term (I'm sure you know the other terms you can't use, but you don't seem to be about using hate speech, you just love that ghetto talk). Just think of it as a learning experience and come back exactly the same, minus one word. If you're too bitter over this, I would totally understand. I've been banned on these forums for some real stupid shit, and it's hard not to be bitter. But it's just a forum, idc. If it was in game bans, then I'd be pissed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Subject 5","date":"2017-12-28T01:16:20.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":10,"body":"The word is N 1 G G A","replies":[{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2017-12-28T04:39:11.248+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Subject 5,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=uyR21lrr,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-12-28T01:16:20.769+0000)\n>\n> The word is N 1 G G A\n\nLol ya I kept seeing the \"%%%%%\" and I'm like how is this guy confused?
