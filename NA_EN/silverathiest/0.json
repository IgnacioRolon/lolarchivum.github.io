The role selection is there for a reason, and if you select two roles and get the one that wasn't your first pick, *you* need to choke down your pride and *you* need to deal with the fact that someone else got the role you didn't get. You can ask nicely, but if they decline, you can either throw a fit and act childish, or you can play what you were given and try to win the game. The guy who declines to trade roles with someone is not obligated to give up his role, and anyone who contests this and suddenly tilts is an asshat and shouldn't be playing with other people if they can't learn to be a team player and accept what they are given.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaoticPinecone","date":"2016-07-06T03:06:33.405+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":35,"body":"Youre young and naive if you dont think the world doesnt operate that way. \n\nFair?
