It's supposed to be \"random\" ! Even if one guy has a \"good champ\" he can still suck with it. Even if ARAM is supposed to be a fun mode, it had still the benefit to allow us practicing teamfights. \nBut now that some unknown dudes want to \"\"\"\"\"\"balance\"\"\"\"\"\" Aram, every feeling playing with/against a champ is wrong ..\nWhy do you want to balance a game mode wich in everyone has 50% win rate? And some champions get buffs i don't understand : Zo√© dealing more damage (in a straight line map where we can't back. Ok), Akali doing 118% damages and 88% damages taken WTF and more and more !!\nSince matchmaking is pretty f*cked up in every game, ARAM what a game mode i liked to play relax.\n\nRevert it please.\n\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-1}}","replies":[]}
