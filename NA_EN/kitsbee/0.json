This error can happen if old or bad game files fail to update properly, in addition to security settings blocking those files from installing correctly.  My suggestion here would be to go through each step of the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure that exceptions are being added for your game files.  Once complete, use the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to clean reinstall and fix up any of those bad game data.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2017-06-01T14:21:05.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Close the client\n2.
