I know that stopping video games is out of the question, so it gave me an idea. What if i created a penalty for losing and dieing? So As of right now When I loose a game I have to go for a one mile run. and for every time i die regardless of win or lose I have to do 5 sit-ups and 5 push-ups. is anyone else with me?","replies":[{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2014-12-16T23:06:22.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about your 3/0 Udyr victory match though? RIP exercise? =c So every match you win with 0 deaths, you're free from exercise, eh. lol\n\nP.S. 8 losses. Enjoy that 8 mile run. lol 305 sit-ups/push-ups though... Wow... If you do your exercise now starting from your 7/7 Ashe defeat match. I think my math is right. That should give you a good start on losing that last bit of flab. =P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2014-12-16T05:18:00.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make sure you stretch properly for a good amount of time, not only will it make the exercise feel better, it will also make it more effective. After exercising always do a cooldown exercise, this also lessens the burden on your body and makes it more effective.   \n\n * A good exercise routine:  \n  * 10 Crunches  \n  * 5 Push-ups  \n  * 10 Squats  \n\nI would recommend doing 1 set for every loss. Maybe add 1 of each exercise for every 2-3 deaths?  \n\nA mile is a tough run even for someone only slightly out of shape, not a bad idea but id suggest doing stretches then a similar routine to the above one before running.  \n\nDoing this at least 3 times everyday in the morning is also just a great way to start the day, so i would recommend doing that instead of this punishment game (never want to make exercising seem like a punishment even if its just for fun, half the battle is psychological lol).","replies":[]},{"poster":"poopoo peepee","date":"2014-12-15T22:25:08.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you're underestimating how much a mile run is if you're out of shape. Also, 5 push-ups/sit-ups are a lot if you're playing for a while. YOu could actually really hurt yourself if you force yourself to do all of that. How about instead-\n\nEvery loss: 5 pushups\nEvery win: 1 pull up( if you can)\nEvery Death: 2 pushups\nEvery Kill: 2 sit ups\nEvery penta: A cookie","replies":[{"poster":"TiggerTime","date":"2014-12-15T23:00:52.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"XD I'm not all that out of shape, just a lil flabby on the edges its not like I'm spilling over my seat or anything, I used to play football and school (welding) keeps me pretty active. just wanna lose that last little flab :P","replies":[{"poster":"KidKaiser","date":"2014-12-16T05:03:15.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"after burn effect.\ndo your football exercises and you're set.\n\njust play game all day erday and let the after burn effect do the rest.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TheKingDodo","date":"2014-12-16T05:02:18.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The exercise if you win/lose/die/kill/penta thing is not efficient\nIn fact, you can say it's outright useless. exercise is meant to be done in chunks. lifting barbell once every 5 minute will get you no where. taking one step every 2 minutes just makes you slow. either do an entire exercise if you win/lose/die/kill/penta which will take a good 10-30 minutes if you want something to happen, or exercise afterwards which is the same as not counting your wins/loses/kills/deaths/pentas.\nMy suggestion: go afk and get that 20minute \"lower priority queue\" and just exercise while waiting to queue (that new leaver buster system got me fit :P)... or just have some self control and actually give yourself a good hour to exercise. it's -1 game basically.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TouchMyNautyBits","date":"2014-12-16T05:00:05.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whennnnnn I feel like I haven't hit the gym enough lately I definitely impose the penalty system for playing league.
