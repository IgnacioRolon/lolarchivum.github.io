And when it says client needs to repair. And it takes like 30 minutes to fix it. Then I started another game and the same problem occurred. Then I was put in low priority queue. I think this is unfair and since the client said the problem was fixed, and it keeps crashing and repairing the files. I am not supposed to be put in low priority queue and the game is still crashing. Can anyone help me with this?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-02T21:28:07.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's really important to take a break from matchmade games for now, and stick to custom games until this gets resolved.
