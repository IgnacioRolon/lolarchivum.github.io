And that pretty much makes the biggest difference here. The OP is claiming \"I got someone banned by 4-man reporting them even if they did nothing wrong\", and that claim is dubious at best. The content is essentially;\n\n- The player in question was 4-man reported\n- They didn't break the rules apparently, and that's something you just have to take the OP's word on.\n- The OP and his premade got an Instant Feedback Report, and you just have to trust that it's strictly related to the 4-man report and nothing else.\n\nIt's too open-ended and vague with zero legitimate detail.\n\nMeanwhile, Tantram's snippet of IFS code is content enough; it may not look like much, since it's essentially an If statement with a single function call in its block, it _is_ enough for someone with a basic understanding of programming to look at it, read it, and understand how it works.\n\nAnd, as someone who picked up and screwed around with Python for a while, I can stand as proof;\n\n> if (reports > 0)\n\nThis is an If statement, where _if_ the criteria is met (the reports variable containing a value greater than zero - so anywhere from 1-9 reports), then the program will step into the block of the if statement, which is contained in the curly brackets.\n\nThat's a boolean flag, meaning that the requirements of the If statement can resolve only to either True or False - False if 0, True if a value higher than 0. Coding it in this way makes it so that every report has the same weight or value, since, ultimately, all they do;\n\n> {\n> review();\n> }\n\nIs trigger a call to the review() function. That appears to be the only thing in the If statement's block, which indicates that that is the only purpose of checking the value stored in the reports variable; triggering the IFS to review the match.\n\nIt is also worth pointing out, that the function call says \"review()\", not \"review(reports)\". If a function call is intended to make use of a variable or other piece of data, it would pass that variable as an argument to the function call (I.E., placing the variable in the parentheses appended to the function call.), so since the reports variable is _not_ passed as an argument to the review() function call, that's another piece of evidence that the number of reports has no influence on whether or not a player gets punished.\n\nAnd, if being able to read and understand a line of code is not substance enough, then I should also point out that substance of character holds weight. Who is more believable; a random player who just got punished and would doubtless try to argue that it's unfair for any reason they can, or a Riot Employee who would have access to the code and would have no reason to lie about how it works?\n\nWhat's more believable - that Riot would build a system designed to allow 4-man premades to leverage punishments over anyone they don't like, or that Riot would build the system to hold all reports at equal value, and only look to see _if_ someone was reported, not how much, and then evaluate their behavior with a review through a machine-learning system?","replies":[{"poster":"Jennifer17","date":"2019-11-15T15:32:15.733+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"obviously its stupid to think riot would allow a system that would ban players if they just get mass reported in a game where every game someone cries for reports.\n\nall i said was there isnt much difference between posting a code line (even IF the code would work if you insert it) and just saying yeah our report did this and that.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2019-11-15T15:44:44.222+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> all i said was there isnt much difference between posting a code line and just saying yeah our report did this and that.\n\nLike I said. Tantram presented all the necessary information front-and-center. He says that more reports != greater weight, and provides a line of code that follows that same logic in design.\n\nThe OP here provides vague information at best, that can't be looked at beyond taking whatever he says at face-value.\n\nHe doesn't legitimately have any proof that _that_ specific player got punished (because the IFR doesn't tell you _who_ got punished, just that someone _did_ get punished), they only vaguely suggest that the player in question wasn't breaking the rules (which is doubtful at best; odds are high that he and his 4-man premade flamed or trolled the player to elicit a reaction, or something to a similar effect), and the only detail that _can_ be taken at face-value isn't even roughly verifiable on its own, being the 4-man report.\n\nEven _assuming_ that the story has any truth to it, it comes into question, _how_ did the player in question behave? Did the 4-man premade flamebait or something similar? Was the IFR strictly pertaining to the player in question, or did it pop up for another match entirely?\n\nTantram provided a line of code that you can look at and understand, and to any small degree, verify. The OP is giving a story that favors their own narrative that _can't_ be verified and they're saying \"look, trust me, it happened\".\n\nIf there isn't much difference there, then I don't know what to say.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2019-11-15T16:18:54.602+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that it's no real proof… but it's also not an anecdote.

The main thing is how dumb of a system that would be to implement, with all of the potential profit loss due to innocent paying customers being banned for no reason.
