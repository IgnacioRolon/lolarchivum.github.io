I've tried all sorts of solutions across the forum AND for the hextech repair tool and everything listed under login issues. I can't submit a support ticket either because it won't let me.

I'm not sure if this is still happening to you robochomp, but I saw your recent post Dango so I'm assuming it's still happening to you.\n\nI'd like to gather both of your LeagueClient logs. The easiest way to grab these and send them to me is:\n1. Download the [Hextech Repair tool ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool)(if you haven't already) and run it so that it gathers your logs \n2. Email support@riotgames.com and attach these logs (this will create a ticket for you without having to log in)\n3. Let me know what your ticket number is so I can go and grab it :D\n\nSorry in advance for how frustrating this is. Hope to hear from you soon o/","replies":[{"poster":"DangoDoof","date":"2017-05-31T23:10:10.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh man, is it great to finally hear from someone!
