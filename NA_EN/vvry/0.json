In my case, I seem to be capped at 9 gems, as I've opened up two 150Ip packages now to add to my gem total, and it's remained at 9. I've waited several hours, and relogged a few times in that period, but my gems have never appeared. \r\n\r\nIs it normal to be capped at nine like this, when it takes ten gems to upgrade an icon? Should I be opening the 150 IP bundles at a certain time, so that the gems actually are credited to my account? I'm sad that I'm losing IP, and unable to upgrade icons, to whatever is happening, but I'm willing to try suggestions to fix it.\r\n\r\nThank you for your help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-06T21:00:13.085+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not aware of any cap, and ad it's concerning to hear that your inventory wasn't adjusting so I looked into this for you.  I counted your jewels individually, and it looks to me like 9 jewels are correct.  To break it down:  You received 9 jewels for 3 chests that you opened up on September 28.  You then bought a Game day chest for 2 jewels making your total 11.  You spent 10 jewels on the Worlds Championship tier 2 icon.  This brought your total back to 1 jewel.\n\nSince then you obtained 2 jewels per game day for Sept 30th, Oct 1, Oct 2, and today.  That brought your total to 9.  Remember that you can only buy the IP jewels once per [game day.  ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/226192107-2016-Worlds-Guide-Crafting-championship-skins-and-more-)\n\nI wasn't able to see anything out of the ordinary, but I hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[{"poster":"VVry","date":"2016-10-06T21:45:42.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are amazing.
