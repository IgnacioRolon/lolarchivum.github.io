Today I tried opening League but nothing came up, so I clicked the icon on my dock and I got a white screen with an error message:\r\n\r\n\"Failed to load URL\" (insert URL here) \"with error \"unsafe port\" (-312).\"\r\n\r\nI had to force quit League of Legends to get this off my screen. Also, I tried putting the URL into Safari and I got a warning saying that the URL might be a 'phising' website? What?!?\r\n\r\nHow can I get my game to work again? Please help, SOS!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-23T02:52:02.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like something may be blocking League from reaching the servers properly.
