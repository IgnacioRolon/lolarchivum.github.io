After the first one (W, L, L) (without free win) I had 88 LP afterwards and could easily get into the next promos again. There I lost again (L, L) with the initial free win and dropped all the way down to 62 LP. \r\n\r\nSo how exactly are the after-promo LP calculated? \r\n\r\nIf they're just added ontop of each other after the promos, the free win seems not to count into that equation at all. Even so it doesnt make a lot of sense that I was allowed to get out of promos with 88 LP since I get around 18 and lose as much.\r\n\r\nI hope it's someone has an answer \r\n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-25T21:20:10.292+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"LP is still tracked for wins and losses while in your promos. Having a free win wouldn't affect your LP at all though since you didn't actually play that game. Just hit me back up if that didn't cover what you were asking!","replies":[{"poster":"Gooberson","date":"2017-10-25T23:08:53.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, thanks for the reply!\nYea I think that and a mistake in my calculations should be what I was asking for!\n\nThank you","replies":[]}]}]}
