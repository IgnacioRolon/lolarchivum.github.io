While he is in Ult, he is immune to Slows, including Attack Speed Slows.\n\nMoreover, Frozen Heart isn't an amazing buy vs either of them. Yi mostly builds On-Hit/Attack Speed items like {{item:1419}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3091}} which will lead to a whole lot more flat True Damage than any other champion. The best way to counter it is by building lots of HP. Since his Physical On-Hit effects are percent health, it means that you also need to go for Armor. Otherwise, you will be melted by his items instead of his kit.\n\nFor Fiora, most of her kit is bursty and ability focused. She relies on animation cancelling to do her DPS. Her Passive is very weak in terms of damage in the early game, making any Armor buy very powerful vs her. However, her late game Passive is monstrous and no one should try dueling her. She is made to melt anyone with it, be it Tank or Carry.","replies":[{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2020-02-11T09:14:15.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Anu3isII,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pdZw6dyL,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2020-02-11T08:20:11.398+0000)\n>\n> Frozen Heart doesn't do anything to Yi btw.

Health can be shred with % health damage. Armor and mr can be penetrated, but % damage reduction passives like those on randuin’s, ninja tabi, and adaptive helm can only be dealt with via true damage, which can be countered by shields and invulnerabilities which do not increase damage taken from % health damage and do not get penetrated by penetration items. I put gargoyles stoneplat roughly into this category because while doubling max hp does increase % health damage, it also boosts the shields on two of the prior items, boosts nautilus’s w shield, and synergizes with alistar to make him effectively take no damage for an item that is fairly cheap. It effectively halves the damage take by anything that isn’t % health damage too, so regardless of anything that true damage hit will only be dealing half as much as normal. For champs that build sufficient ad or have significant amounts of single target with some ad scalings, {{item:3812}} effectively funtions as a % damage reduction item.","replies":[]},{"poster":"River Singed","date":"2020-02-11T08:13:41.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You pick a champ that does more true damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MLDzXnRRR","date":"2020-02-11T07:55:59.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Buy only one or two defensive items - maybe Randuins+Thornmail (so you can cut the healing) and buy AP damage (most tanks have at least passable AP ratios).
