For one using one computer which is my Macbook Pro is easier and cheaper for school instead of having two computers one for school and one for gaming and also i&#039;m too lazy and poor to bootcamp it.\r\n\r\nAnyways the Mac client is one of the buggiest pieces of shit that I have ever seen. This client has been out for around 5 years yet its still a huge piece of shit. I have had countless times where the game crashes even though my ping is completely fine. Now reconnecting is fucking worse. Sometimes it works without a problem and I play again before I dc about 5 minutes later but the times it doesn&#039;t work is hell. It says to reconnect and whenever I try to it just fucking goes to a white screen and disconnects again. This is shit is infuriating and the fact that this is a pretty common problem that has not been fixed yet just pisses me off. After a while I just give up and take a leaver buster but wait the game is still fucked. I will times where i just leave and give up and guess what the games don&#039;t even go on my match history. Now that is one of the many things that happen when I try to reconnect so im going to make a list\r\n1.I try so many damn times that the client glitches out kicks me out of my game (the game doesn&#039;t get put in my match history) and im able to join another game\r\n2.I reconnect successfully and I crash again now rinse and repeat\r\n3.Im stuck trying to reconnect before the client starts glitching out and trying to reconnect constantly\r\n4. There are a fuck load more but if I added every scenario this list would be off the fucking charts\r\nAnyways that is my biggest problem with it. There are other problems that are pretty minor but here is a list of them\r\n1.Play button doesn&#039;t work at all (is grey)\r\n2.When trying to accept the ready check it says I did stays at the waiting for other players screen and stays there for a good 2 minutes before it kicks me out of queue\r\n3. Glitches out sometimes at champ select and won&#039;t let me pick\r\n4.Low fps in game\r\n5.Etc\r\nNow I have one fucking wish for Riot is to fix the mac client and not leave it to die. I love playing league of legends but these bugs have seemed to be more persistent and its really pissing me off. I would expect a huge company like Riot would fix or try to fix the client but it seems they barely seem to know anything about it. Also if you are wondering what my Macbook info is here it is\r\nMacBook Pro 2017\r\n3.1 GHz Intel Core i5\r\nIntel Iris Plus Graphics 650 1536 MB\r\nMacOS High Sierra","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-07-16T23:14:38.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Now before you blame me about using the Mac client I have my reasons.
