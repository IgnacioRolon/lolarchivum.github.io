It's clever too, just look how many people were fooled by it.\n\nUrf was only for April Fool's twice, once when it was initially released and once when they were teasing \"NURF\" instead. If they make it URF every April 1st then there community won't be tricked and it becomes the biggest failure of an April Fool's joke ever. \n\nNo, at this point it's better to keep URF treated like any other featured game mode.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shuyin178","date":"2017-04-01T15:39:43.835+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"URF is no longer limited to April Fools, why do people not understand that.","replies":[{"poster":"Tonkuhz","date":"2017-04-01T15:42:26.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Shuyin178,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ewlcP64B,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-04-01T15:39:43.835+0000)\n>\n> URF is no longer limited to April Fools, why do people not understand that.\n\nthey released AR_URF with the new game modes.
