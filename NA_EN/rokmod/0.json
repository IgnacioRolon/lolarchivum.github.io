Whenever Urfgot has a vocal command he says &ldquo;URF&rdquo; like in the music.\n\nQ: Urf throws his golden spatula in the target direction, making a &ldquo;Bado-ing&rdquo; sound when it hits a unit.\n \nW: Urf surrounds himself in water, (mans gotta have some H2O). \n\nE: Urf throws a rotten crab that makes a &ldquo;Splat&rdquo; sound and breaks apart when it hits the area.\n \nR: A laughing Urf ghost swims to the location then kicks the unit, having itself replaced with &ldquo;Alive&rdquo; Urf and having the enemy where Urf used to be. \n\nLaugh: Urf soars into the air with each huge chuckle\n\nTaunt: He magically spawns a toga, points the spatula towards the sky and has a lightning bolt strike it with &ldquo;URF\" ringing through the air.\n \nJoke: Urf takes out 3 fish and juggles them in a circle. Saying the joke again has him throw them into his mouth and eat the fish.\n \nDance: Urf takes out two mini-guns and spins rapidly shooting around himself yelling &ldquo;URF&rdquo; over 3 seconds \n\nThis skin is wURF, so make sure to upvote so that we can get some Riot attention! \n\n\n\nI did a little tweaking to an already famous [URF picture](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100330032759/leagueoflegends/images/c/ce/Urf_OriginalSkin.jpg) just to show the concept a little better.","replies":[{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2015-04-18T06:25:12.094+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I get to replace ugly ass Urgot with the majestic sea cow?

So far the have Fizz, Nami, Corki, and Warwick with Urf skins. They need a midlaner. I know Urgot get splayed mid, but they need it to be more traditional. I think this could work tho, then corki could go mid, or urgot could go mid, and the other would go ADC. And yes, I did change my opinion halfway through this post.","replies":[{"poster":"RamboDash15","date":"2015-04-18T21:24:37.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:105}} is a mid-laner","replies":[{"poster":"wop","date":"2015-04-20T01:19:48.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He does get played mid, but he is a much better top laner, or even jungler.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MeesterMoo","date":"2015-04-19T02:37:25.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But not a Mage.
