I don't know if it is an internet problem or computer problem. V-sync is on. My computers specs are :\n\nIntel Core i7 6700k\nZ170A Gaming M5 MSI Motherboard\n2x8 GB DDR4 RAM\nNvidia GeForce GTX 1070 FTW\nViewSonic VX2250WM-LED 22-Inch (21.5-Inch Vis) Widescreen Full HD 1080p LED Monitor\n\nSpeed Tests:\nhttp://beta.speedtest.net/result/6850498792\nhttps://gyazo.com/8d97569368f92a911219b81bdc809b34\nhttps://gyazo.com/b7e4829149c8c9bbbd7405b953fbed36\nhttp://logsoflag.com/#esXc4ilB0tX\n\nI mean the lag you see in the video is pretty normal. but i didn't used to happen. Typically i will just be running and it will display me as either running faster or slower, it just changes. \n\nPlease and thank you for any help.\n\nAlso ignore my friends... lol.\n\n\nand also, i haven't noticed lag in any other game besides league, but league is the only moba i play so it might be easier to notice it in league.\n\nAlso, my fps is capped at 60 and movement prediction is turned off.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-05T16:45:42.204+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based on the video and details, it really does seem like a possible network problem.  Your internet speed might be good but you can still have problems reaching specific services like the game server.  You can run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) to know for sure, but I'm pretty confident it's packet loss.  Should that be the case, the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide should fix things up.","replies":[{"poster":"DoYouFeel","date":"2017-12-05T17:42:17.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://gyazo.com/566da10d78b639ababe980cac1a43897\n\nthe logs show that my packet loss was minimal? i think.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-05T18:09:29.891+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info!  I asked our tech guys about this for you, and they'd like to investigate further.  They did mention that you had plays.tv running, so that can cause you some issues.  See if removing that fixes things up.\n\nIf not, grabs logs from the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and attach them to a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so they can help directly.","replies":[{"poster":"DoYouFeel","date":"2017-12-05T18:28:51.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://n1.netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/summary/id=369839a0-9532-b3189c8d-c578-4f62-8595#DNSLookup\n\ni used the berkeley tester and these were the results, if it helps. \n\nI have to study but later i'll disable plays and use the hextech repair tool and test it in a game. thanks for the help. League is still playable, just frustrating.\n\nWould sandbox mode suffice or would i have to play an actual game? is sandbox mode local or do i still connect to y'alls servers?","replies":[{"poster":"DoYouFeel","date":"2017-12-06T04:23:33.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you were right. No lag ever since i closed out plays.tv. I don't understand how that would cause lag on league but not on any other game, but no matter. I can always just download the replay thanks to the new system. Thanks for the help. :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
