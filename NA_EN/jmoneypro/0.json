I played a game yesterday jingling Lee Sin, and every lane began losing HARD. Naturally, frustration started to rise amongst our team, but blaming Lee Sin ended up bringing everyone together. At the end of the game and all throughout starting at about 2:30 (2:30, while I was in the middle of doing blue [2nd camp], is the first time Katarina got angry at me for not ganking), my teammates started typing things like &quot;report Lee no gank&quot; and &quot;NOOB Jungler shouldnt play ranked report&quot; into the all chat. Now I don&#039;t care if people flame me when I&#039;m doing poorly, in fact I actually appreciate it because it makes me play better and I like to hold myself accountable. However, I found this to be ironic because at the end of the game I was the only one on my team with a positive kda (I ended 5-5-6 or something, not very good but objectively better than my team who was 1-9, 3-8,, 4-8, etc).\r\n\r\nMy question is this: Is there any way of effectively jingling when every lane is feeding relentlessly? Additionally, what makes low elo players so prone to blame the jungler when they lose lane? In my opinion (I&#039;m adc main), you should be able to win your lane even if the jungler never comes at all and you get camped (buy wards, don&#039;t overextend, etc). Personally, the only time I get angry with my jungler is if he comes in while I am buying at the fountain and feeds a kill while I ping him back, but even then I don&#039;t flame because I realize he&#039;s trying his best. This experience makes me not want to jungle in low elo anymore, as I know I now have 4 reports against me even though I had an objectively-ok-ish game (interestingly enough I got 3 honorable opponents from the enemy team while they also stuck up for me in the all chat).","replies":[{"poster":"Shiroi Kitsune","date":"2015-03-28T00:01:57.275+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a jungle main I'll put in my input.  Firstly, you're playing Lee Sin who is made for the early game.  If you're not exerting early game pressure with him you're much better off playing a different champ.  That aside, when your team starts getting behind there are two things you can do.  Firstly, you can look to see whether there are any lanes that are close.  If so, try to get a gank in on them to tip the scales in their favor (even just a blown flash can make all the difference).  If all the lanes are significantly behind, look at the enemy jungler.  Is he playing someone who can duel well early?  If not and you're playing Lee Sin go in for some early aggression in the opposing jungle.  If none of these are a possibility, farm as much and as quickly as possible.  The number one thing you need to be doing as a jungler is always be doing something as it is a role which is very unforgiving if you are wasting a lot of time.\n\nOne other thing, even if your team can not fight the other team as a whole, good vision can easily net you picks and objectives.  Just always be looking for those little things which can move you and your team back into the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leti the Yeti","date":"2015-03-27T23:58:58.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"chill, those are the words of those who have never gone jungling\nchances are, you may have ddone nothing wrong\nthere isnt a solution for everything...\nwhat solutions that do exist require sacrifices to be made, and you can be dam sure that no one on your team wants to be that sacrifice\nthey're mad, they're stupid, they will never understand and once they start blaming you, the hive mind kicks in and behfore you know it.. its jungler vs the world\n\nlow elo laners are such a narrow minded bunch you know?\nits all ME ME ME and their lane...\nthey will never see the grand scope of things \nand you can't please them either, you can gank and get blamed or dont gank and get blamed","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-03-28T03:09:26.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've noticed 2 elos where this happens alot:\n\n1. low silver/high bronze.\n2. high gold/low plat (from the plat side mostly).\n\nThe golds I play with all can play safe.

People don't just get irrationally angry with you. You were playing an early ganking jungler, you probably walked right past an easy kill, and she got mad at you.
