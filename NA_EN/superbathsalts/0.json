If you can't handle Riot's criticisms on your behavior, then maybe you shouldn't be misbehaving in their game.

But boy is it great that Riot bans for it xD not because i need my feelings protected, but because douchebags are annoying to me and its hilarious when they get banned. Who cares that much about a game that they brag and insult others ability to play it? What a bunch of fucking nerds. So yeah, I love it when they get punished by Rito. \n\nAnd its weird you think its generational, because some of the most toxic ones are younger kids, like 12-19 years old.

Because \"toxic\" can be doing things like inting,trolling,griefing,afking -- its not limited to chat.\n\nGameplay toxicity(inting, trolling etc) is as bad as people say it is. A lot of players are competitive and like winning, so when someone is inting/trolling it makes the likelihood of loosing a lot greater. So its only natural that those players dislike gameplay toxicity.\n\nChat toxicity is not as bad as people say it is. Simply because there is a mute button and you can ignore verbally toxic text.","replies":[]}]}
