GOT IDEA FOR THAT","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"******Hello everyone and Riot. I am getting very tired of league of legends Because when it actually looks like u are going on a hot streak. And trying to climb the leagues. U always somehow ending up with one person on your team thats feeding the lane and dying for fun. After some mins played. those people goes afk and then its 4vs5 and its bye bye points. Maybe even a demotion for us. I personally think its very sad. That a whole team have to tilt because of one person. NOW! \r\n\r\n- MY IDEA is that when one person goes AFK on ur team. Its should be like that u are not losing any points at all. cuz why does 4 people have to tilt cuz of 1 person having fun with the horrible idea of feeding/leaving the game after they have fed... I think that the one person who goes AFK should lose their points.. \r\n\r\nAnd if u are turning it around. That ur team is about to lose a game and one goes afk for saving the others points. U will see that im right. NO one want do go afk because who wants to lose their own points for saving others? \r\n\r\nSO I THINK THIS IS A GREAT IDEA OF MAKING THE LEAGUE EVEN AN GREATER GAME THAN IT ALREADY IS. LET ME HEAR YOUR OPINION ON THIS ONE. :)! peace out .******","replies":[{"poster":"Dirty Bastard","date":"2017-01-16T18:20:06.323+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't this a double post...

Why would i save my friends ass? and why would anyone wants to leave if they knew only them would lose points?","replies":[{"poster":"Scruberz","date":"2017-01-16T17:43:13.063+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ever won a game where someone on the other team went afk? You shouldn't gain LP for those wins right? They shouldn't count....\n\nMoral of the story is your idea has been brought up thousands upon thousands of times and it's not implemented because it's a bad idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Frozenpeee","date":"2017-01-16T17:47:17.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ofc. but that is not your teams fault?? So its free points for the enemy team u actually trying to win without any afk/leavers. Why should the not get the points\n \npersonally i wouldnt mind letting the enemy team get their points. cuz i wont be losing mine anyway?","replies":[{"poster":"Scruberz","date":"2017-01-16T17:49:23.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you need see the flaw in your argument?

The system is easily abused as noted by the first responder to your thread.\n\nWhy would they reduce the amount of points you lose? You will get an equal number of leavers on your team and the opposing team after enough games have been played, so everything balances out.\n\nThey introduced remake so that they don't penalize teams who have players who couldn't connect.\n\nPlayers who leave a game after it has begun are already punished, and there is no need to limit the loss of points to the team that loses.","replies":[{"poster":"xflapjack","date":"2017-01-16T19:57:09.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But its kinda impossible to win 4v5.
