I watch almost every single professional game, from NA LCS to LCK and LPL. I support several streamers. I've spent thousands of dollars on League of Legends ( I even have a $2,000) dollar Thresh Tattoo! Haha, my point is I've been stationed all over the world and have had to transfer servers because of this, it eventually adds up. In just 4 years I've been stationed in Japan, Turkey and now back to NA. Don't get me wrong, I will pay because I LOVE League but I think it would be a super awesome thing if RIOT would waive the transfer fee for Active Duty Military members due to the moves we undergo to meet Mission demands. Just a thought!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-30T18:13:48.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a constructive and thoughtful suggestion, and I totally dig the idea.
