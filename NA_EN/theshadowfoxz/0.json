This champion is broken, this one is not useable, and this one is OP. But for the most part, many champions are more than enough balanced that a single player, no matter how fed, cannot 1v1 without being somewhat skilled at the game. In addition, many people are able to hold their own as any champion against any champion if they are skilled enough. Shouldn't we not ask that the game is made easy for unskilled players? This would really suck for all of the unskilled players, because the game would be made too easy for the skilled players. In my personal experience, I have won lanes against my counters, and not been able to absolutely destroy even matchups. \r\nFor people that disagree with me: Even if every champion were perfectly balanced, people would ask for a nerf on the champions that the most skilled players played, thus causing those champions to become imbalanced. The most skilled players would then switch to the next best champions, and the cycle would repeat. So if we just wait, the cycle will go all the way around and every champion will have been nerfed, making each champion technically equal, and therefore, balanced :P.","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-02-21T21:53:28.398+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely disagree. Played optimally, you can't even touch Kalista with Garen or Darius. And yes, Kalista *can* 1v5 against a full melee team with no gapclosers.
