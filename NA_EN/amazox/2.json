Make it so the screenshots taken through the client can be the only ones to exist in the client, this way none would be able to send you a photo-shopped version of a screenshot during champion select to abuse this.\n\n#That is the only actual solution for the toxic people during champion select I can find that cannot be abused.\n\nIt is 2018 Riot Games, no more joking, we need to end toxicity in this game as a community.\n\n#Justice needs to be served","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-22T02:12:22.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're working on making things better with reports, and figuring out ways that pre/post game chat can be included.
