I left for fun, I was doing well and I didn't leave because I was mad (etc.). After that I pressed reconnect. I wasn't able to reconnect weirdly enough. I clicked reconnect multiple times. I even tried restarting league but when i pressed the close button it wouldn't close league. I had an OK internet connection because youtube was still loading and the skype call didn't bug. I checked  and I've got a 10 min leaver buster. sad :c  \n\n\nDear riot can you please make me happy and delete the leaver buster because they still won and it wasn't my fault.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-13T18:28:30.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like that match was over fairly quickly, so you may have been gone long enough for the match is over.  It sounds to me like you experience a ghost game, meaning that you were trying to reconnect to a game that was already over.  The match needs to communicate with our server that the game finished, otherwise you may get stuck at reconnect.  Usually, relogging will fix this otherwise you'll need to wait.\n\nIf that's not the case, then there may be other network issues here so let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"bigmasterchicken","date":"2016-09-14T07:32:14.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Porocles,\n\nI have closed the window now and I can log in on league just fine.  Still the penalty tho :c","replies":[]}]}]}
