Basically, packet loss means that some of the data coming from your network get lost or damaged before it reaches our servers. Let's use our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) to analyze the network logs of the game that had the weird lag and we can find out for sure. Take a screenshot of what it says and post it here so we can go over it together.","replies":[{"poster":"WeHaT","date":"2017-06-23T12:11:07.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so today I tried to record 6/23/2017 on custom and that's what I meant Is it from packet loss ?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBLiWSNaMSI","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-23T20:06:04.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeeeeeeep. That point around :55 seconds definitely looks like packet loss, and that screenshot shows about 5% which is enough to cause those delays. Most of the time packet loss happens somewhere along the route that your ISP sends your connection, but sometimes our tech guys can adjust some settings to help.
