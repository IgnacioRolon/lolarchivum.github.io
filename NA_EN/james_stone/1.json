The curse (or Amumu himself?) dooms anyone that comes too near. Amumu himself is sad and throws tantrums. He views his curse as a friendship curse because it denies him his greatest wish: friendship. I think the curse itself is more of an isolating curse in general or might even be *almost *harmless, only telling Amumu his greatest fears, after which Amumus own powers do the rest.\nWhy are you throwing a tantrum over his curse when it's the same curse it was anyway? You wanted Riot to change Amumus curse to something different?\n\nI'm not saying I like Riots directions. I lost my faith in narrative when Trundle got removed, got reaffirmed when Xerath go this main motivation and modus operandi changed.

For I know that if I did, tomorrow an announcement could be up telling me that my new favorite character is now removed and replaced. It'll even dare to tell me that this replacement will be a great, new and wonderful character and Riot can't wait to tell stories about the new guy.\n\nBut I do not think this video was a step in the wrong direction. It characterised Amumu really well and told us who Amumu is. As long as we also get deeper lore like the noxian diary and stories that don't just exist to show off a character or two but to tell an engaging story, characterisation is great.\n\nLittle sidenote, please keep discussion civil and constructive.

His lore, like other Shurima champions, was cut to a mere summary, and most act as if this is the final state.\n\n\"Oh no, Skarner is just some random crystal bug being all scary and mean in Shurima! Boo hoo, Skarner was removed from Kalamada because the Institute of War no longer exists, thus removing justification for a political incident that created the Dominion map! Waah! Riot is changing everything!\"\n\nThat is the extent of intelligent discourse in response to Narrative's decisions; bitching.\n\nAm I pleased with every action Narrative has taken? Hell no. Do I whine like a petulant child because the situation *appears* not to satisfy my desires? Hell fucking no.\n\nI wait, I watch, I play the game and formulate my opinion as circumstances shift to accommodate new information. I do not throw a tantrum because Riot released a music video celebrating the release of an album of assorted League music unrelated to lore. It is disappointing so many \"fans\" of lore are immediately up in arms over a *music video* simply because it wasn't what they *wanted*.\n\nFor goodness sake, you are upset that Amumu is essentially the same character he was at release, despite information being leaked that elaborates on the nature of his existence. \n\n> FRIENDSHIP CURSES.\n> \n> MOTHERFUCKING FRIENDSHIP CURSES\n> \n> THE LOWEST AND MOST JUVENILE BLOODY CLICHÉ APPLIED TO THE STUPIDIEST AND LESS EXPLAINED FORM OF MAGIC!\n\nVery eloquent. Never mind this \"Friendship Curse\" is less about denying friendship and more about spreading death and decay. It is a psychological torture of delicious sadism; Amumu wants friends, to know who he is and simply be loved, his curse destroys everything he touches, causing people to avoid his presence, to shun his existence, and Amumu cannot understand why. Amumu's despair turns to frustration and rage aimed at those he perceives as deliberately causing him pain through isolation, triggering a *very* destructive tantrum that effectively obliterates everything in the immediate vicinity. Everyone too near the epicenter of his anguish is dead, Amumu is alone, and his poor reputation grows worse, prompting greater revulsion and deepening Amumu's loneliness. It is a terribly cruel feedback loop.\n\nYou are upset, your post made that quite clear, many people share your disappointment, but expressing it like this is pathetic.","replies":[{"poster":"James Stone","date":"2015-01-27T17:08:23.711+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":8,"body":"As I've said, the Amumu thing is innocuous. It's not why I'm mad. It's just what I see like the final straw. And I am angry. I've said so myself, so I'll perhaps (in fact, most likely) be much more emotional and irrational than I'd normally be.\n\nI won't be around blinding myself while saying that the old lore is perfect. It had some glaring issues (especially the original 40's lore, when Riot was still figuring out what they wanted) and some parts where bad or so average, it's meh. Amumu was one of them, this I have no doubt.\n\nI have no particular love for Amumu's lore. He's a sad mummy. He's still a sad mummy. Whatever.\n\n\nBut do not dare, for a single second, tell me Skarner's lore is the same as it is before. That would just be a pitiful attempt at fooling me and yourself.\n\nYou know who Skarner was? He was the Crystal Vanguard, the front guard of his kind, buried closer to the surface to be the first to emmerge, to scout ahead so the Bracker (I believe that was the name for his species, as I've said, again, I grew detached to the lore) would know where it's safe to leave. Why did the Bracker go underground in the first place, to hibernate? Because humans fucked up the land so badly with the Rune Wars, the above surface was actively toxic to them. Only the toughest, like Skarner, could survive. The younglings, lacking defenses, would most likely be dead before they were even born.\n\nNow, what happens to Skarner, what made him awake from his hibernation? A grade-A ecological disaster which could easily compare itself with Chernobyl (The lore was created as a reason to justify some of the mechanics of Dominion. The enhanced mana regen and reduced healing? That's the magical equivalent to radiation poisoning. The only reason champions are able to survive is because of the Summoner's protection), caused yet again by the humans and their wars.\n\nNow he has every right to be pissed at the humans. Most of us would no doubt lash out at the first humans we'd find, in Skarner's case the innocent workers which were investigating the disturbance. But after a period of exaltation, did he do that? No, he understood that they had nothing to do with the events which brought him to the surface, so he calmed down, proving that he was the Vanguard of his kind not just by his brute force but also because of his clear mind and spirit, and accompanied them to the Summoners, who explained who they were and their purpose: to stop any further Rune Wars and to reverse the ecological devastation they caused (as you might recall, the Institute was originally created because the Rune Wars rightfully fucked almost every part of Valoran. The Plague Jungles? Rune Wars. The Great Barrier? Rune Wars. Kumundu Jungle critters developing sentience/sapience? Again, Rune Wars. Hell, most of the now ancient geological structures were a direct result of the first and most destructive Rune War, where it is rumored men stole magic from the Gods themselves!).\n\nSkarner understood these Summoners, this Institute, would be the only hope to create a world his species could live. Do you understand what that feels like? Of course you don't, and neither do I. Imagine what it would be like, to be the last human on Earth, surronded by creatures you never saw before, in a world which has chanced countless times since you last saw it, knowing that your actions could directly contribute or doom all of your kind, that million of unborn children could die before even seeing this new strange, yet beautiful world, because you didn't do enough, because you COULDN'T do enough. That's what Old Skarner had to live with. Every single day of his (presumably) long live.\n\nYou could feel the pain and loneliness in his voice, his quotes (\"This world is so strange...\"; \"I miss my kind.\"), the wise, contained being hidden between the scary, deadly monster he appeared to be, the barely contained rage in his voice when he got the chance to enact his buried feelings at those who almost destroyed his kind (\"FEEL MY STING!\"; \"NOW, I'VE GOT YOU.\").\n\nIn his hands rested the future of the Bracker. In his claws, the spirit of a long forgotten species. In his actions, a better future for his kind.\n\n\n\nIf Riot is going to take this beautifully crafted story and turn it into something else, they better BACK THEIR FUCKING TRASH and give us proof it was all worth it. Now look around! Look at the Narrative's creations! Is anything, besides the Sion's background, one of the only in recent memory to actually use and merely expand the old story, even at knee-level of Skarner's plight? Are you seriously going to tell me Xerath's new story is better than the old? That being turned from a self-made, deserving man, thirsty for knowledge and power simply because others feared to thread the paths ahead, risking at every turn being consumed by his own desire, sacrificing his humanity, his relationships, and in the end himself, for his dream of crossing paths never crossed before, to a backstabbing Jafar-wannabe who did not even deserve the power he was granted, and merely stole it?\n\n\n\nYes, Amumu was always a sad mummy. BUT THAT IS EXACTLY THE POINT. NOTHING HAS CHANGED. So far, everything this once-wonderful story full of potential had is being stuffed in the grinder for we to get slightly retouched and improved versions of what we already had, at best, or at worst taking beloved characters and either destroying them completely or embarrassing them beyond belief by giving them some of the most cringiest, stupid-sounding lines I've ever seen from a team of professional writers (My example: Just about everything Nasus says during those horrible Shurima short videos), with stories based on pure Rule of Cool (There is no way in hell Valoran would have been able to survive this long being tag-teamed by the Void, the Shadow Isles and massive city-wide annihalations which seemed to be in style in Ancient Shurima) and with some of the worst Deus Ex Machinas and luck-based plots I've read in recent years (Again, Azir's story. So, let me get this straight. You have a guardian snake who's idea of defending your temple is giving gigantic amounts of power to anyone who trespasses - seriously, Cassiopeia, the noble woman who can only kill from behind, was transformed into a snake-poison mage who has no trouble defeating various men at once, as shown in her portrait, whose powers grow over time - Azir just happened to have a Lazarus Pit around to ressurect/heal Sivir, which apparently never needed to be tended to in the, what, millenia it was in disrepair, and for some reason saving his descendant somehow granted him the right to Ascend, proving that the Sun is an actual, God-like entity, and can directly give untold power to a dude at will, but can't stop a fucking slave from turning his chosen people into sand-colored ash). \n\nYou want to know why the \"Friendship curse\" got me so damned mad? Because it reminded me of where this all started. With Katarina and her bloody passion. Passion, passion, passion, being thrown around like it's the day of the week, with seemingly no understanding of how ridiculous it sounds.\n\nSeriously, Amumu's curse is that he causes everything too close to him to become depressed, and everything he touches to rapidly decay into dry flesh and ash, and you go around saying his curse his, paraphrasing, \"to have no friends until the end\"? And to top it all off, he's apparently still friends with Annie, because either the narrative team is too lazy to update their damned site, or because reasons that we'll no doubt see \"soon(tm)\", which is a good way to say it'll maybe be tweeted by a Rioter or answered in a Q&A on Reddit, essentially denying that info to anyone who didn't browse those sites at the right time, or who doesn't use SurrAt20 or LoLKing.\n\n\n\nBut sure. Let's act as if being left in the dark for about four months about characters we actually gave a fuck about, leaving us only with an insultingly short summary which manages to at the same time sound nothing like old Skarner, while still telling diddly-doddly-shit about the new one, not to mention the other victims of the Grand Retcon, is totally ok. They were planning this for at least a year. A FUCKING YEAR! AND YOU ARE TELLING ME WE SHOULD EXCUSE THEM WHEN THEY DON'T EVEN MANAGE TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING HALF MANAGABLE TO FILL THE GAP UNTIL THE \"REAL\" CHANGES START HITTING? FUCK NO. \n\nSorry, got carried away again. Point being, no, I should not, and will not excuse this behaviour from a team of people who are being payed to come up with this crap. Most fanfictioners I had the pleasure to work with wrote better than the new lore team. CupcakeTrap and his team write better straight up lore than the bloody official Lore Team!\n\nPerhaps my response comes off as pathetic. I shall accept that. But I shall also take confort that it is nowhere near as pathetic as the Narrative Team's recent behaviour.","replies":[{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2015-01-27T23:14:08.185+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is a large post and I have difficulty with keeping track of information, so please forgive me if I fail to address a point you have made, because there are quite a few.\n\nYou clearly have an attachment to Skarner and his lore, and is wonderful to see people resonating so strongly with an enticing story. Considering what happened to many of Shurima related champions and the brutal pruning of their respective lores, your concern is understandable. Skarner had a poignant tale, defending his still sleeping people from potential threats in a world unfit for their return. He was a terrible monster that defied expectations and proved the nobility of his soul.\n\nI would never lie, that his story remains the same, but I do expect Riot's Narrative team to retain the critical aspects of his tale. The Institute of War is dead and circumstances which created the Crystal Scar with it. So how could Riot work to accommodate this change without destroying Skarner's lore? They moved him to Shurima. Those that love Skarner and the lore were distraught, but identifying curious details and piecing them together, I came to my own conclusion, one that may or may not be accurate.\n\nSkarner was moved to Shurima along with the entrance to the sleeping Brackern. That is what he guards, and what could be more precious than protecting access to his hibernating and incredibly vulnerable people? Skarner behaves monstrously because he has no reason to suspect anyone trying to contact the sleeping Brackern have their best intentions at heart, and to prevent word spreading of their location he murders any who trespass.\n\nYou mentioned Kalamada's eruption being the disaster which awakened Skarner, an incredibly powerful eruption of magic on par with the atrocities of Rune Wars long gone. Now that he has moved to Shurima, there is nothing to rouse him from such slumber, right? Yet the circumstances surrounding Shurima's greatest tragedy certainly could substitute for Kalamada. The creation of the Crystal Scar destroyed a mining town; Xerath and Azir's misunderstanding destroyed an entire *nation*. I cannot imagine this being more devastating for Skarner to awaken after countless years of dreaming only to discover the people of Valoran had learned *nothing* from the Rune Wars. Confronted with the devastation of Shurima, so close to where his own people hibernate, he chooses to remain awake for the sake of protecting his species. He willingly took upon himself the loneliness of centuries until the world was safe for the Brackern once more.\n\nNot only that, but we may now have the reason the Brackern were forced into hibernation to begin with. It was mentioned Nasus and Renekton ascended to combat a grave threat well before the fall of Shurima, and what greater threat could there be than an entire species of angry, crystalline scorpions? That certainly gives the impression of Brackern being evil monsters, but what if they confronted Shurima, perhaps the entirety of Valoran, in the name of protecting the world from nations who so foolishly toyed with powers beyond their understanding? They tried to warn other nations of the terrible magic they recklessly employed, reminding others of the horrifying Rune Wars, but the factions of the time stubbornly refused to give up their magic. With no other option, the Brackern took it upon themselves to save Valoran from ignorance. So great was their fury, it demanded the ascension of two heroes to combat the Brackern's might. Faced with the strength of Shurima born on the shoulders of two demigods, the Brackern relented, deciding if they could not save to people of Valoran, they would wait them out.\n\nNow all of this is merely me talking out of my ass, making wild speculation, but to me it fits the situation Riot has created. The Shurima event was shit, the videos were shit, and Riot's inability to account for the changes it would cause and failing to plan accordingly is shit. However, until Riot makes a spectacular blunder, I am content to piece together what information I have and post my thoughts when appropriate.\n\nI have no delusion Riot values my ideas as valid critique, but I make my posts anyway in the hopes that I am wrong, and I expect others do the same.","replies":[{"poster":"LeeDark","date":"2015-01-28T10:11:00.717+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm sorry, but you are wrong about Skarner.

I have stayed the day away from the forums and calmed down, and I realize how aggressive and angry my responses came. Apologies.\n\nAnd yes, it is good to see that the essence of Skarner can remain. He, along with Viktor and Xerath, are the best representatives of the golden age of lore (with Lux as a honorary mention), and it deeply pains me to see the stories and events I had invested my time learning and caring about gone.\nHowever, essence is not nearly enough in Skarner's case. Sometimes, things are more than the sum of its parts.\n\nEven if what you said was right (and let me tell you, I quite enjoyed reading it, you've got a good imagination), it still destroys parts of Skarner. He now is an isolationist. He no longer actively works to try to provide a better world to his kind, he simply waits and waits until everything harmful around him dies. He no longer works with the descendants of those who nearly doomed his kind, understanding that they are different people than their forefathers. He's just a guardian.\n\n\nWhat Riot's lore team seems to fail to grasp, is that, above all else, somethings are greater than the sum of their parts. They cannot simply take the \"essential\" parts of Skarner, of Xerath, Viktor, Lux, Swain, Fiddlesticks, Nasus, Renekton, Trundle and so many others and expect the end result to still be those characters. It won't. At best, we get a Marvel-Style \"Ultimate\" version of them. \nAt worst (as could be seen long ago with Trundle) the original character dies, mutated beyond all belief.\n\n\nI praise your optimism, but it is one I cannot reproduce, for a simple reason, one I've stated on a thread before this one:\n\nI may find, in this new lore, some character which entices me as much as Viktor, Xerath and Skarner did. I may like this new lore as I liked the old. But how can I even justify to dedicate myself to it if I know that it is as vulnerable to complete termination and retcon when the next batch of fresh writers Riot inevitably hires will not like to \"work with the restraints of the established story\" - quote from Opeli, paraphrased. The precendent is set. By allowing the retcon of everything \"inconvenient\", Riot set themselves to create a lore which is modular and interely inconsequencial, with almost no support to stand and as fragile as the deviations of some new headwriter who thinks he knows it all, or some remnants of the old team, now in power to do what the old team never allowed.\n\nSo please, stay optimist, for it is a beautiful thing to be. I, however, will refuse to play the part of the Narrative Team's fool yet again. The new lore for me does not exist. It is an alternative reality to the true League of Legends.
