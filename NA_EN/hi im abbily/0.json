The first two games my internet was fine, I managed to get pass the loading screen, and champ select, however, upon when minion spawned, I had 2000+ ms for my ping. I don't know why, I couldn't move, or so it occurred upon huge delays. Before I know it i already have multiple deaths. I assumed that because of my ping, my champion would have automatically move back to the fountain (since the reconnecting message popped up). I was told to leave by my teammates since it was better than feeding, and that hopefully they could remake. However, we couldn't remake, I don't want to leave the game since I will be punished for it, and by the time my internet was stabled again, i was already far too behind to have any real meaningful impact. Is there a possible solution to this since my team couldn't /remake because my internet was constantly reconnecting and disconnecting.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-31T17:53:52.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems to me like you're having a network issue here that's causing some pretty severe lag spikes, or possibly packet loss.
