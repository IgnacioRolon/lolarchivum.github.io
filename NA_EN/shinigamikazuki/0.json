I can't start League of Legends because BugSplat is missing? I assume it would be a perfect thing since Bugsplat does nothing but ruin the game by kicking me out and force closing the client.\r\n\r\nHowever, for whatever reason I cannot start this game without downloading it. And how the f**k do I download it? Should I reinstall the entire freaking game agian?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-07T23:52:48.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're having to patch the game every time you launch it, odds are you're running it from a temporary folder or your files are extremely corrupted. Downloading a ton of files on each launch is abnormal, and a sure sign there's an issue with your install. To resolve this, I strongly recommend you reinstall League using [our Reinstall guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends). Ensure you're installing to the default directory: C:\\Riot Games, as many custom directories will cause issues.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
