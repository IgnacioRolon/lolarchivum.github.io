Specifically, it was Nvidia's GeForce Game Ready 382.05 driver. After two days, I've narrowed down a possible cause of League freezing on Alt+Tab in-game and on loading screen. I did other possible solutions I read online (ex. Turn off Game Bar, reinstall/repair League), but they did not work. Today, I uninstalled the driver and found that League stopped freezing on Alt+Tab. Hope this helps whoever has this problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-11T00:17:57.351+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes driver updates can cause some pretty weird interactions if they didn't account for certain actions in some games. Good job on figuring out what the main issue was! Keep that driver update in mind though if things start behaving oddly again, you may need to check for a newer update a little down the line.","replies":[{"poster":"AlofTwilight","date":"2017-07-11T04:51:31.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright.
