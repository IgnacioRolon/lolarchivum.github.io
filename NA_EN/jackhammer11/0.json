I don&#039;t know if other players are able to see it, but it really affects me in negative ways. like when I want to engage with an ally after using my w on them. i can&#039;t see if I&#039;m able to reactivate w to heal the both of us. this also sucks while im farming or fighting drake. don&#039;t get me wrong, the effects of the spell are still active. it does damage and heals me and allies just like normal, except I just don&#039;t know if its active without a quick glance down to my spells. when I get into a team fight and just put the w on a random ally, after a second or two, it&#039;s hard to remember who its on\r\n\r\nas far as how often this happens, I notice that it happens almost every game. sometimes even during the normal animation, it will just stop. and after it happens it won&#039;t un-happen until the next game. \r\n\r\njust so you know, I also run all animations, shadows and everything else at max.\r\n\r\nthanks for the help riot, you guys are the best. now please go show my home-boy Morde some love &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-09-07T04:01:05.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It only happens if you reactivate his W while dashing with {{item:3152}} (or if you reactivate while your W is on an ally and they're dashing with it).
