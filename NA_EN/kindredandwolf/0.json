My fps is fine and my ping is all normal and i have no idea what it is but every single game  my character will randomly RUN ALL OUT at the closest enemy champion and i will click EVERY FUCKING WHERE but im still running right at them. Like literally out of the blue, everything is running smoothly then BAM im literally running full speed at an enemy champion, every single fucking time it happens there is an enemy champion in veiw and I just run right at them kamikaze style. While this is happening i don't seem to be lagging and my fps is perfectly fine but I lose all control input. cant use abilities and I cant move where i want. It usually last about 1-2 seconds, long enough to throw the game and give the enemy a free fucking win. Thing is I can see everyone all around me moving around and using their abilities just fine while im doing this and it definitely doesn't feel like client side processing lag, fps issues or lost packets I'm so absolutely livid right now.    \n    \nI have alot of computer and programming experience and i don't know what is going on.    \n   \nI checked to make sure there was no extra processes running and went a step further and disabled every single process i didnt need to run league.  I ran 12 passes on my ram, checked my cpu temps, turned off all forms of security and gave league and all its sub folders administrator access.  I ran numerous stress tests on my GPU and took it apart and cleaned the hard to get to dust.  My hard drive isn't the best but it reads and writes fine. I checked for virus's and malware (I usually know right away when my computer feels weird). I ran my internet through a proxy I programmed myself into a virtual console and monitored my bandwidth and site visited activity to make sure someone hadn't hacked my wpa without me knowing it. I updated my drivers, defraged, CCleaned, and checked my registry by hand.    \n   \nAfter al of this didn't fix it i restored my computer to an earlier date months ago and tried again, still happening.\n\nI can't play ranked and I've lost the last one's I've played, i've been stuck playing aram and getting pissed at the random suicides in that too. Has anyone else had this problem?\n\nI have NO problems playing any other graphic intense games, ONLY league. I've come here as a last resort as im very close to completely wiping the computer and starting over from scratch. I really don't wanna have to do that since I have terabytes and terabytes of information I'd have to back up and restore fuuuuuuuck. What am I missing?\n\n\n\nPS I blame all of this on that pile of hot garbage called \"The Eve rework\". Fuck that rework.","replies":[{"poster":"KindredAndWolf","date":"2017-11-03T17:53:56.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                             192.168.1.1 -                                           0 |  239 |  239 |    0 |    0 |    5 |    0 |\n|                             96.120.3.89 -                                          0 |  239 |  239 |    7 |   11 |   58 |    9 |\n|te-0-6-0-2-ur04.charleston.sc.chrlstn.comcast.net -       0 |  239 |  239 |    7 |   10 |   58 |    9 |\n|be-60-ar04.charleston.sc.chrlstn.comcast.net -              0 |  239 |  239 |    8 |   11 |   49 |   10 |\n|ae-30-ar02.westside.fl.jacksvil.comcast.net -                   1 |  239 |  239 |   29 |   35 |  159 |   30 |\n|be-33489-cr02.56marietta.ga.ibone.comcast.net -         0 |  239 |  239 |   43 |   47 |   75 |   48 |\n|hu-0-11-0-4-pe04.56marietta.ga.ibone.comcast.net -      0 |  239 |  239 |   42 |   46 |   76 |   47 |\n|               as7922.eqdltx.seabone.net -                                0 |  239 |  239 |   42 |   46 |   76 |   45 |\n|                          104.160.135.35 -                                         1 |  235 |  234 |   42 |   45 |   60 |   42 |\n|          ae32-br02.chi01.riotdirect.net -                                 0 |  239 |  239 |   56 |   59 |   92 |   58 |\n|           ae1-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -                                   1 |  235 |  234 |    0 |   58 |   72 |   71 |\n|                           104.160.131.1 -                                           0 |  239 |  239 |   56 |   60 |   93 |   61 |\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting & Cloud Provider\n\n\nOk this explains why my other games are working and league isn't. It seems its a problem directly related to my isp (comcast) and leagues servers. I hate comcast and my knowledge on the matter ends here. I have no idea how to fix a packet loss problem directly related to my isp. If it was my router or modem id be relieved right now. I seriously didnt think this would be packet loss since i have brand new equipment. Any suggestions?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-06T03:35:24.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, one good thing to know is that packet loss doesn't really have much to do with your equipment or your own pc at all. More often than not the blame is entirely on your ISP and how they're routing your traffic, there might possibly be some nodes that aren't working properly and they just don't realize it yet!\n\nYour best bet is to reach out to Comcast with that traceroute. The traceroute is proof that something is going wrong, and there's not much they can say to dispute hard facts!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-03T01:57:11.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aw man, it definitely sounds like you've done a *lot* of troubleshooting on your own, but I think I know what's going on here. This all sounds an awful lot like Packet Loss to me personally. Essentially, packet loss happens when parts of the data coming from your network get lost or corrupted before it reaches our servers. \n\nA good way to check if this is happening is by running a quick traceroute to our servers at 104.160.131.1 using a program like [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/). Take a screenshot of what it spits out and shoot it my way so I can take a look with you!","replies":[{"poster":"KindredAndWolf","date":"2017-11-03T17:54:36.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=qPeqsoEE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-11-03T01:57:11.009+0000)\n>\n> Aw man, it definitely sounds like you&#x27;ve done a *lot* of troubleshooting on your own, but I think I know what&#x27;s going on here.
