I noticed Vel'koz would throw himself under the world, occassionally. No, seriously - His E would sometimes make him, or minions, 'fall' under the world, and proceed to swim through the land, teleporting around.\r\n\r\nAtlantean Syndra occassionally misses her stun occassionally.(Can this be confirmed? This is merely one I've heard a lot of and felt like I've seen, however I am not an adept Syndra player)\r\n\r\nSo.. Can we fix these? Especially the Vel'koz one? Because he's currently my favorite champion but it makes it awful hard to play him... Under the world.","replies":[{"poster":"cautomaton","date":"2014-05-22T22:46:09.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the Vel'Koz bug, so you mean this?\n\n http://youtu.be/bYVDEeuM3NU \n\nIf so, then I know that's recorded in our bug backlog. I don't have an ETA on the fix though. If that's not it, some additional details would be great.","replies":[]}]}
