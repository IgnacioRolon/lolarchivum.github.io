Your IP may not be sync'd properly.  Relogging or waiting a bit of time should refresh your balance to the accurate amount.  Hope that clears things up, but let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2016-08-20T05:56:42.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I notice there have been more bugs on the client lately for some reason. Like after being logged on for awhile and you click on loot button and it crashes. or being logged in for awhile and everything bugs out in champ select and then you don't see stats screen in game (my temp fix for this is to force close League with task manager and relog during load screen and hopefully make it to lane in time, but doing this, you lose your early speed buff so it takes longer to get to lane). and the other thing is IP/RP taking forever to update after you buy something. Sometimes click on shop, then profile, then shop again will update it. Sometimes relogging doesn't always fix it and you have to click a few things after relogging for it to finally update.\n\n2 other things I'm not sure about. When someone signs on and off, the amount of friends online stays accurate, but the amount online on your lists does not update until you type something in the filter and then backspace it. What's with that?? The other thing that bothers me though that ISN'T a bug, just a WEIRD change. Is why the scrollbar was taken off on notifications when you have quite a bit?? That is a real pain in the ass. How come the scrollbar was removed on the notifications???? It done a long time ago but I'm just now bothering to ask about it. I hate so much that it's gone...>.>","replies":[]}]}]}
