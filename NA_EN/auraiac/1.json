Do they release them then wait to make them available? I'm still new to stuff being released. I was really hyped.

I'm not sure of a specific measure of how long it actually takes for them to release after being teased. I'm pretty hyped for these skins too, so I'm ready to buy them ASAP as well! :D\n\nLet's sit tight until they get their official release.
