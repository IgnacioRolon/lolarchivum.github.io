You paid for an exchange from real money into riot points, and that's what you got. Whatever you spent said Riot points on or whatever you decided to do or not do with them is irrelevant. It's probably better to just take a break from the game and leave your account until maybe one day you feel bored and decide you wish to try a hand at it again or notice there's an update that really catches your attention, like a new champ or big change in the game.","replies":[]}]}
