Help?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So I have about 24 extra Championship Jewels, and I already have the golden icon. In the future is there going to be something i can do with these? Also I'm pretty upset that the day I got ip, you guys removed the icons, so i have a golden icon but with no team icon. I didn't know that i had to have a team icon in order to flash the thing in game. FeelsBadMan. Would love any supportive feedback.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-04T22:08:06.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lew's information here is pretty solid.  Any excess jewels you have can be used for additional team icons if you like.  I have no information on additional uses for the jewels or if anything will be done with them beyond our [Worlds 2016](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/226192107-2016-Worlds-Guide-Crafting-championship-skins-and-more-) guide.
