His ultimate--if used right-- guarantees a kill. \nHis chase is pretty good.\nHis sustain is really good.\n\nI don't see why WW would need a buff. He's still strong. He's not broken like he used to be lol.\n\nEdit: I don't want to see WW take control of the jungle like he did earlier this season. He was insanely over powered for a long time until he was finally toned down a bit. Now, he's in a good spot. He's not broken and he's not weak.","replies":[{"poster":"DoFr","date":"2015-04-21T10:01:30.333+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"uh... have you tried to chase someone...or rather, gank someone pre-6 or your ult down?\n\nhe got so much sustain that he just doesn't offer anything outside his ult","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-21T10:42:28.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WW needs a emergency rework his kit is bad and toxic at the moment, He is a jungler but he no have a gank pre 6, a tan without no AoE dmg, Mana hunger, his W have a lot of hidden power, can use his E to run away (a skill create to chase not to run away), Ult have no counterplay if he reach a isolate enemy, but he is very reliable on his ult, also his ult make his vulberable because supress him and not reduce the dmg incoming, make him a easily target on tf, and the list goes on with devourer, challenging smite nerfs...\n\nI'm Warwick main all the season 4 (Feral flare time) and he have a huge power, maybe so OP but now after the 4.21 patch he are overnerf, Devourer and challneging smite too, so its time to fix. He its only viable on low elos, or good to smurf bronze accounts IMO.\n\nHas a insane sustain and is very good duelist but his weakness are more than his strenght, in low elo WW its a powerful GOD, but in high elo is a thrash, He really need a rework too fix his core problems and toxic kit.\n\nFor me He needs this to stay healthy:\n\n* -Remove W on his kit, replace with a skill that allow him gank pre 6.\n \n* -Make his E works only towards enemies (like Vayne passive,  Soraka Janna)\n \n* -Add more interactive gameplay on his E (passive and active part instead a toogle)\n \n* -Turn him R into a skillshot like Sejuanis Q, Gragas E or Malphite R to add counterplay.\n \n* -Give a damage reduction when he supress an enemy to reduce the vulnerability.\n \n* -A CD penalty if he uses his R to escape to minimizes his escapes chances,\n \n* -Fix his mana cost and mana pool.\n\nSo he needs a rework to stay in a healthy state, his problems are very evidents right now.","replies":[]}]}
