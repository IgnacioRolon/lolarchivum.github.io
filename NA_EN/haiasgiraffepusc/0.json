It takes me roughly 5 minutes just to get off the black screen then I sit at 100% loaded. I use voice comms and my teammates all tell me they are in game already. I get in game anywhere between 5-10 minutes of the match so and I instantly get kicked for inactivity, so I then repeat the same process. As you can imagine I have acquired the leaver buster penalty for it. I have looked into it online and I cannot find a solution. I talked to support about this a year ago and they did not offer any real help. Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix this?????","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-28T18:49:18.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're having some network problems specifically staying connected to the game servers, which would end up showing as a black screen or disconnecting entirely.
