I get to the black screen and cannot load in. I have completely reinstalled the game, I have downloaded the repair tool, and nothing will work. Can someone please help me? I have accumulated so many leaver busters for something I cannot fix and it is ruining the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-20T03:57:22.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First, I recommend testing any of the following changes in a custom match to prevent incurring any further penalties. Most of these black screen issues are caused by an *unstable connection* to the servers, so this is likely caused by incompatible network settings on your local network.
