Your mind works very quickly with your hyperactivity because you cant stop to think about just one thing. It can be considerably difficult, because your mind is just too fast for you to keep up with. It's hard to keep track of what you do or what you need to do, and even the most simple tasks can take ages because you're busy thinking about other things. \n\nI think it's pretty neat if they did add such a thing to Rakan, even if it's out of game. Would be nice to see other people's opinions on it too.\n\nEDIT: A comment from 4 Step Cadence jogged my memory! I totally forgot about voice lines.\n\nUpon looking at Rakan's current voice lines, there are a few which specifically state that he's forgotten something.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/kQQXKFw.png\nhttps://i.imgur.com/NyYmvUl.png\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Yt9hQLM.png\nhttps://i.imgur.com/TrFZvAN.png\nhttps://i.imgur.com/mSfzHDx.png\n\nIf you've got ADHD, you remember things a lot less than other people do. This is because your mind works too fast to store important information, and rather it will store information which is appealing to you, such as a favourite smell or taste. Rakan here shows that he is interested in the \"plan\" quite often, but just cant remember it.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2018-07-13T01:34:23.408+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"No... but also yes.  (Crap, I seem to be saying that a lot recently.)\n\nSo I was the narrative design / writer for Rakan's character, VO, bio and color text.  \n\nCreating a character's voice isn't really a science it's alchemy at best.  I can't speak for writers in general but for me it's an odd blend of, historic research, mythological research (including doing a Jungian breakdown of the archetype), psychological research; taking parts from my own--somewhat bizarre checkered--past; using my family; my friends, and sometimes TV/Film character vocal performances (strangely never games). \n\nI begin mix these all together in my head, and begin writing story sketches.  These short stories try and find the character's voice and often take many tries and are refined as the game kit changes.  I compared these with the archetypes the team was looking at with a variety of media figures (which display current versions of the archetype).  \n\nAt the same time, I begin monologuing --literally wandering around and trying to talk in the character's voice-- (trying different accents, tones, rhythms etc...)   Basically trying to figure out how the character thinks and what they want/need.   \n\nEventually, I can \"do the voice\".  --which I am frequently called upon to do while pitching/and performing it in riot.  Doing the voice helps gain alignment and buy-in on the VO personality.  And only after I can \"do the voice\" do I write the VO.  The color text-- is sometimes a modified version of the last \"story sketch\" i used to find the voice or a whole new short story displaying that psychological state now that I can perform it.  (then it's directing/working with an actor and other steps...)\n\nSoooo...  that means...\n\nRakan contains a lot of me in my late teens early twenties, combined with several of my friends (2 women and 2 men), and a member of my extended family.  Several of the people on that list had ADD and Manic- or manic depressive behaviors.  And I did research those behaviors but only because certain people I knew were prone to that sort of thing... \"and when they were drunk that one time in philly it was perfect for Rakan...\"  \n\nSo creating a ADHD character wasn't a goal --it was something I arrived at backwards but then realized it was a part of him and wanted to make sure the character was psychologically accurate (i.e. A bit larger than life but still kinda realistic).  \n\nThat said-- I think part of what is important about Rakan (and makes him an unique hero) is he certainly is somewhat ADHD but he's also **extremely** emotionally intuitive, empathetic, and amazingly present.  So although Rakan find's making plans boring and focusing hard, simultaneously he is alive in the moment and hyper-aware of what everyone around him is truly feeling.","replies":[{"poster":"masIow","date":"2018-07-13T19:26:50.636+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WAAARGHbobo,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=kQPqEYfs,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2018-07-13T01:34:23.408+0000)\n>\n>So creating a ADHD character wasn't a goal --it was something I arrived at backwards but then realized it was a part of him and wanted to make sure the character was psychologically accurate (i.e. A bit larger than life but still kinda realistic).\n\nI'm so glad you responded!

Also not to mention the fact that you put being mentally ill and being LGBT together. Don't know what point you were trying to make.\n\nI'm saying that if someone were to confirm my theory, it would actually put me at ease to realise writers think about people individually. Not everyone is alike, and no one is perfect. People do have things wrong with them whether it's physically or mentally. \n\nI already liked Rakan before I thought of this theory, but piecing together his character as a whole is very enjoyable for me because it shows personality. It shows him as if he were a real person, and that's what character development is about. Characters can be incredibly relatable, and it helps us understand what the writers were trying to tell us when presenting these characters. \n\nDid you know that Taliyah is indirectly stated as Bisexual? Whilst I already liked her as a character before I learned that, it's a nice addition. It makes her more human. It gives people who relate to her a better understanding of her personality, her interests, her characteristics. \n\nI saw you also quoted another person in a different discussion about how characters are only supposed to be high quality and interesting, but that's the thing. Adding unique qualities to a character makes them interesting. It makes them different, just like us. \n\nUltimately, what you've just said took my original post entirely out of context, and it was pretty rude.","replies":[{"poster":"Azeranth","date":"2018-07-15T00:58:40.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> put being mentally ill and being LGBT together\n\nThere was no point being made, other than similar arguments are made about LGBT characters in other forms of media. But, seriously if you think I meant something by it, guilty conscious and all that jazz\n\n> to realise writers think about people individually \n\nIf you care about them individually, why do you want it confirmed they belong to a group (also realize)\n\nTo be clear, I firmly believe that a character who is well designed can exist in a vacuum, and still be interesting. Rakan would still be Rakan even if the concept of ADHD did not exist. There is nothing wrong with drawing inspiration from real people, even groups or demographics. Tahm Kench draws heavily upon southern dialects, speech pattern, dress, mannerisms. That catfish is straight from the Mississippi river.\n\nBut if I then go on to say, \"Yeah we made Tahm Kench for people who are from the South\" and suddenly, that's very different. Do all southerners fall into that narrow band that is Tahm Kench? Do those who don't enjoy that character type, and why the assumption they would? If it was made \"for them\" there is at least some level that it would be liked. You don't get gifts that people don't have ANY desire for. Are there even those who are embarrassed or ashamed that the representation of Tahm Kench is a poor explanation of their culture, and something of a strawman built on stereotypes which are dehumanizing and often insulting.\n\nRakan and ADHD are the same way. Do all people who have ADHD fall into that very narrow personality that Rakan is? And even if a majority of people with ADHD do, is that really the character they want as the face of their demographic? Many people consider the boundless energy, lack of memory, inability to concentrate to be crippling burden to their life. Never remembering loved ones birthdays, constantly missing details, making others feel unimportant because you weren't giving them your full attention. And how insulting is to those who do see it as a burden, yet over come this burden. The people who live with ADHD, but go on being perfectly to all outward appearance, the people who have to spend time excusing themselves to go zone-in with some privacy before getting to work. What about those who turn to drugs because they can't handle the frustration of never being able to follow through on a plan, and get their life in shape?\n\nWhen a character pulls inspiration from a cultural perception of a group. When I use stereotypes and urban myths to build up a familiar character, who is charming and entertaining. There remains enough uncertainty shrouding it. It is very easy to separate the character as their own entity, and attribute them to their personal choices and situation. I can look at Rakan, and say \"Yeah hes like that, but not everyone is.\" and not only do I know that, there is no uncertainty as to if that's the implication. If you don't understand the importance of implication, consider the following. You know that no race is inherently superior, but I imply one is. Even though I'm obviously wrong, the mere suggestion is insulting.\n\nHowever, when you come out and say \"This character was made with ADHD as one of the things driving their design\" you've immediately started attributing all of those _Associated_ traits, as being the direct product of their supposed source. It's no longer left to the imagination, and the wisdom to know \"They're not all like that, that's just this one character\" goes straight out the window, because the writer has blatantly stated. \"No, they're like this because of ADHD, and that is what ADHD causes. ADHD causes you to be a forgetful wreck, and we find it appropriate to mock the condition of chronic misery of absent mindedness as a legitimate illness.\"\n\nAt a certain point, its no longer a character, and starts becoming a **Caricature**","replies":[{"poster":"masIow","date":"2018-07-15T21:36:38.929+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Azeranth,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=kQPqEYfs,comment-id=0000000000000000000000000001,timestamp=2018-07-15T00:58:40.695+0000)\n>\n>\n\noriginal post was a headcanon\nnot that deep\n\nbye","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FurriesAreHot","date":"2018-07-11T05:14:12.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have ADHD, and I am by definition “sick in the head”.

He laughs a lot but maybe that's because he's excited. If anything I'd say he's more of a Pyromaniac. \nI can agree with Kennen, Veigar and Lulu though!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Agent Corgi","date":"2018-07-10T17:47:20.883+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"You're only given one spark of madness...You mustn't lose it.\"\n\nHonestly one of my favorite Rakan quotes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ˉˉˉˉˉˉ","date":"2018-07-10T23:45:25.588+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can confirm\n\nSource: I have ADD","replies":[]},{"poster":"YuGiHo","date":"2018-07-10T23:20:13.543+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"sure why not?","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZackTheWaffleMan","date":"2018-07-10T14:14:05.023+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone with ADHD, this seems pretty accurate.","replies":[{"poster":"Valaran Nara","date":"2018-07-12T19:22:25.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ZackTheWaffleMan,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=kQPqEYfs,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-07-10T14:14:05.023+0000)\n>\n> As someone with ADHD, this seems pretty accurate.\n\nAgreed.
