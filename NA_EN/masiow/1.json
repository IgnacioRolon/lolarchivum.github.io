I'm a Digital Media Design student at a University going into my second year in September. \r\nEver since I started playing League I really wanted to involve myself with the creativity around it, i.e. drawing fanart, speculating on lore or making theories.. and writing. After it was confirmed that Rakan had ADHD, I started asking more smaller questions about characters, like if Gnar could be understood by other Yordles. \r\n\r\nThe thing is, I'm really into creative writing. I did a lot of it when I was younger (fanfics, yo, they get you places) and I've always been interested in writing more. Funnily enough, my current partner's mother is a famous author, and it's inspiring me even more to get back into the writing I once loved creating.\r\n\r\nBut I was wondering - how exactly would I become a Narrative Writer at Riot, if I so wanted to? What steps are there in the process of applying / being hired, and what would be expected of me? Whilst I wanted to become a concept artist for the longest time, I would also like to use my writing skills at some point too!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Pls","date":"2019-05-22T16:45:55.430+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there! We get this question semi-regularly here on the boards. You might be able to find some of the older posts (or folks who have been here longer than I may be able to point you there!) The links to internship programs and our jobs page are definitely great places to start as well!\n\nAs a writer, I feel incredibly fortunate to work here. My peers are folks with some pretty incredible credits to their name - TV writers, published novelists with many books under their belt, playwrights, and so forth. Many of those folks also came from other studios where they built up deep experience in writing for games. At the risk of sounding cheesy, I'm regularly amazed at how freakin' talented they are. Jamming ideas and working together in writer's rooms are just a blast. \n\nOur writers tackle everything from working on champion design, to writing voiceover (VO) scripts, to short prose fiction, to worldbuilding and design, to comics, to cinematics and short films, and many other things. Riot looks for a broad array of talent! Writers, depending on seniority, are expected to have deep knowledge and craft expertise in at least one media, and broad knowledge / ability to write across our various forms and outlets.\n\nThe easy to say, hard to do answer is: write what you love, build a great body of work, gain experience on games where you can, and share that with us! We also are exploring ways to grow our outreach and opportunities with universities and students on the start of the journey in exploring this industry, so keep an eye on the internship page.\n\nAs for the actual hiring process, that's its own beast - happy to talk more about that, but I think that's a separate question than what you're initially interested in :)\n\nHope that helps, and cheers!","replies":[{"poster":"masIow","date":"2019-05-22T20:10:30.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot mChao,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=jLaWjZwR,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2019-05-22T16:45:55.430+0000)\n>\n\nThanks so much for responding!

So basically, you pretty much have to be emo to be good at writing for Riot. It's honestly a mystery how Nunu's lore and Yuumi's lore got through, when they'd smeared so many other cheerful characters like Ivern, Neeko, and Zac with horrible events.","replies":[]}]}
