But i don't think this is true. A rengar with adc build will 1 shot and hit just as hard as an adc. Similar to a nidalee or syndra building adc. But people always think the problem is the marksman themselves even though I personally feel like marksmen are actually pretty weak because of their lower base health, lower base per level, lower base movespeed, lower damage, and lack of 1 or more of the following. hard cc, dash, stealth, burst damage on abilities. They always lack something and only few adcs have some of some things because marksmen class are supposed to use autos as their main source of damage. Meanwhile, champs like yi can build adc, hit hard with their abilties, but also with their auto attacks. The only downside is they don't have ranged autos, but ranged autos isnt even as powerful as it was back in season 1 and 2. Nowadays so many champs have dashes and hard cc that your ranged auto attack isn't justified to make your base health, health per level, base ad, base movespeed, lack of burst in abilities to be low. just my opinion. People think marksmen are op but it's actually the items and runes that are too much.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
