Instead, Nami and Fizz might deal just a little bit more damage to him with water based skills. Nami taking a little more damage from Kennen, etc. Kind of similar to Pokemon and the type interactions. Another thing I thought would be cool is if an allied Janna shot her Q through allied Yasuo&#039;s windwall, maybe it could expand and have a bigger hitbox. It&#039;s little combinations like that between champs that I find fun to think of. I understand if micro-interactions like that would be super difficult to do without more bugs and crashes and problems, but if you guys ever get to a point where you can do something like this, I&#039;d love to see it.
