Will this be enough to play LoL games whole month? Which sites take the most data?Can i watch at least 4-5 videos of 30 min?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-24T00:55:45.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's impossible for me to answer this question without knowing more data. League matches can use 50-100MB per match, depending on which map you play on, the length of the game, and how many actions are taken during that game. The rest of your data usage will depend on what resolution and refresh rate the videos you're watching are in and how many other services or content you access. I'd just keep an eye on your usage throughout the month and if you see that you're close to hitting your cap, you can reach out to your provider to make changes to your plan.\n\nI hope this helped in some fashion. Feel free to hit me up if you have further questions I can address.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Giolas","date":"2017-01-23T20:21:51.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reply me as soon as possible!","replies":[]}]}
