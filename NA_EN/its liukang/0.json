I'll never take that chance again unless it's a promo series or something, I'll dodge and not even look back.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"420 grams","date":"2016-11-02T14:17:58.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unlike Gohan, learn to dodge","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShinkoMinori","date":"2016-11-02T12:49:36.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What to do?
