You can be in an aram(a casual game mode meant for fun) and have people flame you for building SLIGHTLY off meta, or making a minor mistake, all while the person flaming you is 1/15. Every time anyone dies at all on the map, expect everyone to cap their ping limit mia pinging the person&#039;s body. Don&#039;t think you can ever try to ask your teammates to do anything(IE: &quot;can we please play round the infernal coming up?&quot; or &quot;I can&#039;t afford to build grievous wounds, can someone else?&quot;) or you&#039;ll get told to uninstall, kill yourself, or be called various slurs.\n\nIt&#039;s not that these people are &quot;hurting my feelings&quot;,  it&#039;s that I don&#039;t queue up to babysit for immature 12 year olds or 20 year olds acting like 9 year olds and have to deal with their annoying crap for the entire game. If you mute them and don&#039;t give them the attention they want, they&#039;ll start trolling you by doing things like going out of their way to set you behind(Following you around taking jg camps if you&#039;re a jungler, smiting cannons and trying to take cs if you&#039;re a laner, inting, etc). \n\nThis stuff has always been in the game, but it&#039;s happening with such a frequency now that it&#039;s hard to even enjoy the game. Maybe it&#039;s a negativity bias, but it feels like everyday I have at least a game ruined by this kind of stuff, and I don&#039;t queue up for many games anymore, so that&#039;s really saying something.","replies":[{"poster":"Best Vi Earth","date":"2018-12-24T17:46:38.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"i agree but its not because of the toxic. its about the people complaining about toxic in my eyes. you can defeat the words with the perspective of your own mind. change the meaning of it and mold it to something you can understand. what people are doing including yourself is creating it more than lessening it. your focus switched  to some other person other than learning the game or even taking their perspective  and incorporating it into your build or even gameplay.","replies":[{"poster":"R107 Games","date":"2018-12-24T17:57:45.189+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Best Vi Earth,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=1tfdRjhU,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-12-24T17:46:38.761+0000)\n>\n> i agree but its not because of the toxic. its about the people complaining about toxic in my eyes. you can defeat the words with the perspective of your own mind. change the meaning of it and mold it to something you can understand. what people are doing including yourself is creating it more than lessening it. your focus switched  to some other person other than learning the game or even taking their perspective  and incorporating it into your build or even gameplay.\n\nExactly!\n\nPeople need to stop letting words affect and control them. If someone is flaming you, you can either take it as something positive or simply ignore/mute. Players in high elo don't let a fucking chat box affect their gameplay, and they don't use it as an excuse either.\n\nI believe it's a vocal minority complaining about flame. Because if flame ruined games that much then League would've been declining by now. Thankfully a majority of people I've played with know how to use the mute button and don't get on a mental breakdown.\n\nFocus on the game, not your feelings.","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-12-25T05:47:09.866+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=R107 Games,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=1tfdRjhU,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-12-24T17:57:45.189+0000)\n>\n> \n> Players in high elo don&#x27;t let a fucking chat box affect their gameplay, and they don&#x27;t use it as an excuse either.\n\n**_Cough Cough Tyler 1_**\n\nIts a specific case, But since High elo players are rare, I feel the need to point it out.","replies":[{"poster":"R107 Games","date":"2018-12-25T06:04:34.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=breakordoom444,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=1tfdRjhU,comment-id=000100000001,timestamp=2018-12-25T05:47:09.866+0000)\n>\n> **_Cough Cough Tyler 1_**\n> \n> Its a specific case, But since High elo players are rare, I feel the need to point it out.\n\nI've only seen Tyler1 get affected from chat when in his days of being extremely toxic and un reformed.\n\nCurrent Tyler1 doesn't do that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zardo","date":"2018-12-24T19:44:38.681+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">Focus on the game, not your feelings.\n\nExcept you're ignoring the negative effects of flame that I personally have 0 control over\n\n* Teammates tilting\n* Soft inting\n* Refusal to group and/or otherwise cooperate\n* Flame wars- result in people standing afk flaming for minutes on end\n* Trolling- a lot of flamers start to troll if they don't get the reaction they want out of you\n* Overall reduced communication- If someone is spamming mia pings, you're not going to pay attention to a mia ping they send.

Point is that muting does not solve anything, and toxic behavior can come through both gameplay and not just chat alone. But yet, chat is a big punishment but toxic behavior gameplay wise is punished very softly if not at all. So yes, who gives a damn about respecting what people want when someone can just troll you or throw games anyway and they don't even get punished for it. \n\nWhat is the report system gonna do if I buy 3 frozen hearts? It seems trollish and terrible, but it still doesn't look like im throwing. It could just be im new, and i am trying to stack armor up. How would they know if I was intentionally doing it despite knowing it sucks, or if i didn't know and im new? They dont. I could cost the game to my teammates, but hey I don't get in trouble for buying 3 frozen hearts. You wanna get more technical? I could buy a frozen heart, iceborn gauntlet, manamune as soraka. Guess what? You can't get in trouble for making such a bad build decision. I could do it intentionally and make it hard for teams to win but not get in trouble. I could easily just build normal but then in lane attack once every 5 seconds only so when a all in fight happens we lose because im only attacking every 5 second interval while my adc is dead already. The report system does nothing to gameplay behavior. So again, who gives a gromp about caring and respecting other players decisions so they can respect yours if somebody can get away with what I just explained?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"cQmCMyron","date":"2018-12-24T19:36:16.032+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Communities are directly effected by a games quality, so it's not really hard to figure out why more and more people are getting into arguments, raging in and out of matches more and more as time goes on and more worthless patches devoid of any healthy changes come through.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Asobi Spirit","date":"2018-12-24T18:13:54.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Theres always the mute button Zardo, plus you can choose to queue up with buddies exclusively.
