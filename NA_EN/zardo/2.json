This champion is not only unfun to play against, but now he&#039;s also effective in some of the highest levels of play as well. Right now your only options of counterplay are to stand behind minions in the laning phase(which you may not have against lanes like cait/blitz), and to maintain perfect vision control out of the laning phase(which is near impossible in a soloque environment). Those are your only 2 options to counterplay, as those are your only 2 ways to avoid being hooked. Blitz&#039;s hook is more of a death sentence than thresh&#039;s death sentence, as after he hooks you, he knocks you up and silences you, so it&#039;s not like you can qss or cleanse it. To be honest, I think a changing his knockup to a stun and increasing his ult cooldown would allow for more more counterplay to the guy, all while not making him useless. What do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"NotSpecialDude","date":"2017-06-17T19:26:07.674+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not likely to happen and here's why. Blitz is defined, entirely, by his ability to land his pull. If he can he dominates, if he can't he's worthless. Binary as you can make him.\n\nBecause of this, even the smallest of tweaks must be dealt with carefully as he could be busted with even a number off. Throwing his iconic status (a trait shared with both teemo and garen) and a vgu is unlikely to happen.\n\nMy best guess is that the current meta in high elo has evolved to a point where blitz is viable and after a while he will die down on its own.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-06-17T19:29:45.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This.\n\n\nIt's even litterally mentioned across all regions and stages that blitz can lead to a snowball win... Otherwise it's almost going to be a loss.\n\n\nBesides he'll be tossed out the meta soon enough with the buffing of other supports.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AwesomeGuyDj","date":"2017-06-17T23:06:33.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good times when i had 40% cdr on blitz and could ult every 12 seconds.\nGood times.","replies":[]}]}
