You&#039;ll be getting your 1/5/0 jg braum calling your mid lane gangplank a troll pick, and telling you all about how you&#039;re intentionally feeding with a scoreline 0f 0/4/15. You&#039;ll get your kassadin flaming the hell out of you for missing a flash, and shortly after he&#039;ll miss his ult over a wall 3 times, then fail the flash. You&#039;ll utilize your champion perfectly in trades, hitting all your cc and abilities, perfectly weaving in autos and dodging their abilities, but the 0/4/0 lucian who ulted the wrong way, took tower shots for no reason, and got hit by the morg binding will call you useless. You&#039;ll get people saying you did no damage, but you&#039;ll check the damage charts and you&#039;ll have more than double theirs. Hell, the support will sometimes have more than theirs. People will always blame their jungler for not ganking, because that nidalee that just came up for the first time and got a kill has been camping their lane the whole game. Finally, you see a lot of people flaming their supports for their lack of vision, but they normally have a non upgraded trinket with 2 charges.\r\n\r\nYou may be thinking, &quot;wow you can&#039;t be serious, this has to happen very rarely&quot;, but it doesn&#039;t happen rarely. Almost every losing game this happens. If you ever get flamed by someone at low elo, instead of tilting or flaming back, just hover over them every once in a while. Instead of going on tilt, you&#039;ll actually enjoy the game more. Has anyone else experienced comedy gold in the lower elos?","replies":[]}
