I have absolutely no input to give on the current honor system. I have never in my entire life been above honor level 2 and I am almost always honor level 1 or 0 when I play league. I will say this - it has not affected me at all, and I could care less about it. I literally don't even know what it does, or what it's for. I do, however wish I had a PBE account and I will say that is a decent incentive for the honor system. Though, I think the honor system would be indirectly buffed by improving the actual penalties handed out to toxic players. On another note - I believe that any non-related offense such as intentionally feeding, real world trading, or using third-party software should be mandatory for manual review and upon confirmation, the only suitable punishment is a permanent suspension. That is my opinion on that. \n\n\nAs far as we know Riot has no intention of changing the system. They have not addressed these issues since the Tribunal was removed several years ago, however everything else about the game has been vastly updated. This is the most obsolete aspect of the entire game - the behavior punishment system. Now if you're a player who has never been banned, you're probably thinking \"what issues? I don't see any issues\". Yes, YOU don't see any issues. Pretty much every single person I have ever had on my friends list in league have been permanently banned at least once. It happens much more frequently than you might think. Since 2015 I have received approximately 30-35 permanent suspensions across all of my accounts. I've gotten used to it at this point. It doesn't bother me when it happens anymore. I don't get upset. I'm just disappointed. However, the purpose of this post is to better the game. I believe I am one of the most toxic players in the world. So if anyone's got anything useful to say about the penalty system, it should be me. I have the credentials necessary to make statements about the system, and that's why I believe Riot should hear me out. If you don't believe that I have this many instances of permanently banned accounts, I am not going to show proof. This is because showing proof of my accounts would condone being permanently banned and consider it as some kind of achievement. I am not boasting. It is not an achievement. Anyway, with that little rant out of the way, this is how I believe the player moderation system can be improved, and as a result, improving the behavior of toxic players:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOne popular method was disabling your enter key or keybinding it to something else to prevent yourself from being toxic. You might think, \"**why don't you just stop being toxic? then you don't have to worry about being permanently banned!**\" okay, but what if you can't? \"**then you have no place in this game**\" okay, sure. but I COULD, if the player moderation system was improved. Toxic players like myself COULD have a place in this game without ruining anyone else's experience by implementing an improved penalty system, which would make Riot more money and strictly increase the player base. \n\n.\n.\n\n\n\nWith a top-notch penalty system, you could even turn toxic players into non-toxic players. The current system in place is not capable of doing that, and I can say that with a lot of confidence. Long story short, the ways Riot has tried to address player behavior is... poor. \"you can't get ranked rewards!\" I really don't care. \"you can't get hextech chests!\" I really don't care. You know what I care about? That feeling of dread having to queue up for a 20 minute wait because I AFK'd. The penalty is the key. The reason this penalty works is because YOU made someone else's 20 minutes a waste of time, now YOU have to waste 20 minutes of YOUR time. **That is how you properly penalize a player.** When the penalty has nothing to do with the offense, it accomplishes nothing.\n\nI don't believe this is some insanely huge discovery. I think it would actually be fairly easy to change the game for the better, and this is how -\n.\n.\n\n\n\n\nFIrst of all, let's look at the punishments that are available;\n\n* **Chat restriction** - This is the most petty punishment I've pretty much ever seen in any game, and it's not because of the punishment itself, it's because of the duration of the punishment. Usually a chat restriction lasts 5-20 games. This is not enough to change a player's attitude and they usually won't even give a shit at all about this penalty. This can still be an effective punishment, and I say this because when I receive a chat restriction, while I don't really care that I am chat restricted,_ it feels good to have it finally lifted_. I understand the current purpose of chat restrictions is to give players a warning. I think that's a solid idea. I think the current chat restrictions are actually a decent misdemeanor punishment, but could perhaps be a little bit longer, increasing exponentially for each occurrence within a certain amount of time eg. 5, 25, and 125 games. I do not think going over 125 games is a good idea because it can reinforce a 'prison mentality' where the player believes their punishment will never be lifted so there is no incentive to reform. However, _I have never been banned while having a chat restriction_. This is important to note, because it indicates that chat restrictions effectively reduce toxicity and this is why I believe this is an appropriate minor penalty and the duration should definitely be much longer than it currently is. \n\n* **14 day suspension** - For serious chat-related offences, this is the standard penalty. As a toxic player, especially a new toxic player, going from chat restriction to 14 days of no league is incredibly drastic. And I agree, it should be drastic. However it doesn't fix anything because the penalty is unrelated to chat. Players WANT to reform. Nobody likes being toxic. Give them a way to reform, and they will. But because this is a competitive game and not an MMO, people get angry. If you want to fix your players, fix them, instead of removing them from the game altogether. I believe a \"time out\" is necessary. A player might be on a massive grind and going on perma-tilt. That player clearly needs a break. But how long do you need a break for? Most people do not need a two week break. 3 days is more than enough time to get over something, so that's the number I'm standing by. It is also important to remove players like this from the game for a certain period of time because this will decrease the amount of the toxicity in the game. By reducing the length of the punishment, you can hand them out more freely, and reduce toxicity even more than you could with the 14 day suspension. Force the player to take a break, long enough for them to get over whatever petty thing it is that they were upset about. Upon returning to the game, the real punishment should begin. I'll talk about that later. TL;DR 3 days, not 14. It's too overkill and redundant. \n\n\n\n\n* **Permanent suspension** - Simply put, I believe this should not exist in the chat-related offenses category. It is too severe of a punishment, and solves literally nothing. The player will, inevitably, create a new account. This also encourages people to buy accounts, and a large majority of the real world trading business relies on permanently banned players looking to quickly get back into the game. I should also add that the manner that this penalty is handed out is incredibly aggressive and hateful towards the player. After reviewing my proposal to changing the way suspensions work, this penalty should no longer be required, so obviously my proposal is to completely remove this penalty. \n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSo what's the conclusion here? Chat restrictions are an effective way to reduce toxicity. 14 day suspensions are irrelevant. Permanent bans are unnecessary. So, what's left? \n\nThe 3 day suspension. Force a player to take a break while simultaneously reducing the overall toxicity in the game. Like I stated earlier, reducing the length of the punishment allows you to dish it out more frequently, resulting in a less toxic game as a whole. For example, let's say right now there are 2000 players with a 14 day suspension in NA. If you implemented a 3 day system, you could instead have anywhere from 4000-8000 players (these are just ball park numbers) undergoing a 3 day suspension because you are simply allowed to morally dish out the punishment more frequently. I know this might not make sense to you right now, but just keep reading.\n\nTypically my 14 day suspension reform cards have 3 games worth of chatlogs to show me the evidence of why I got banned. Why didn't you ban me during the first game? Why wait until I have 3 games worth of toxic chat logs before penalizing me? And this is where I make my point. \n\n* For those of you who don't know, suspensions are handed out based on how toxic you are in a certain period of time. After a certain amount of time (I'm not too sure on how much time, but roughly 3 months) of no incidents, it resets. If you chalk up 3 incidents of toxic chat logs within this timeframe, you get the ban hammer. It can potentially be less than 3 if your chat logs are severely toxic (such as hate speech or homophobic slurs), but generally it's 3. Chat restrictions work almost the exact same way, but for less serious chat-related incidents.\n\nThe problem with this incident stack is that it forgives players for being toxic. You should be punished each and every single time you are toxic, instead of being toxic for an extended period of time. This makes players feel like they can occasionally be toxic and get away with it if they haven't been toxic for a while. This is why you constantly see toxic players in your games and it makes it _feel_ like the community as a whole is just insanely toxic. It's because they know they can get away with it. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------Here is my full length proposal:-------------------------------------------------\nBefore I begin, each instance of suspension should be manually reviewed. Chat restrictions can be handed out with the same automated system they have been using, with the exception of the lenience.\n.\n.\n\n\nChat restrictions should be implemented in increments of 25 and 125 games. 25 game chat restrictions can only be delivered once per account.\n125 game chat restrictions apply when you have been reported and the automated system verifies you were toxic. This should have much less leniency than the way punishments are currently dished out. You will no longer have a certain amount of \"damage\" you can take before you receive a punishment. You get reported, the system verifies the report, you get the chat restriction. No lenience here. All chat restrictions should remind the player that they will be severely punished if they repeat this behavior and there will be no warning. The chat restriction is the warning. 125 is a big number. Big warning. This will portray to the player the sort of 'drastic' approach Riot has chosen to take towards the player moderation system.\n\nIf you have received a 125 game chat restriction within the last 6 months you are eligible for suspension, regardless if you have finished your chat restriction or not. \n\n\n\nUpon any instance of being reported, and verified that you are indeed toxic by the automated system, you should then immediately receive a 3 day suspension. \n\nReturning to the game, you should be confronted with a reform card. There should be three types of reform cards. One for general chat-related incidents, one for serious chat-related instances (such as homophobic slurs or hate speech), and one for a multi-time offender. The multi-time offender penalty is issued to a suspended player who has received at least one serious chat-related penalty.\n\n\n\n\n\n* **general chat-related incident reform card** - If you were currently undergoing a chat restriction at the time of the offense, you are unable to type in chat for the remaining duration of your chat restriction. So if you had 70 chat restricted games left, you can no longer enter messages in chat for 70 games. You are then issued an additional regular 125 game chat restriction. This penalty can reset infinitely and doesn't count towards a multi-time offender penalty, but does not stack.\n\n* **serious chat-related incident reform card** - If you were on a chat restriction at the time of the offense, you cannot enter messages into chat for the remaining duration of your chat restriction, plus an additional 125 games. You are then issued a regular 125 game chat restriction. Receiving this penalty leaves you eligible for a multi-time offender penalty on your next suspension, regardless of the severity of the offense.\n\n* **multi-time offender reform card** - You cannot enter messages into chat until 6 months has passed since your last suspension in addition to any remaining amount of games you are currently unable to enter messages or chat restricted in (eg. 3 months + 95 games, in that order). You are then placed on a 125 game 'major' chat restriction, where the amount of messages you start with is reduced from 3 to 1 and you can only store up to 3 messages. After completion, you are then issued a regular 125 game chat restriction. Any instance involving a player being suspended while on a multi-time offender penalty will reset the penalty to the exact punishment it was originally and add an additional month of being unable to enter messages into chat. This process can stack infinitely. So to clarify with an example, if a player is suspended for a second time (with a history of a serious chat-related offense in the past 6 months) and had 50 remaining games of being unable to enter messages into chat, and his last suspension was 2 months ago - He can no longer enter messages into chat for 4 months, and once the 4 months is completed, he can no longer enter messages into chat for 50 games. He is then placed on a 125 game major chat restriction, and then a 125 game regular chat restriction. If he is punished while on a multi-time offender penalty, he is then unable to enter messages into chat for 5 months, + 50 games, then the 125 game 'major' chat restriction, then the 125 game regular chat restriction. \n\n\n\n\nIf 6 months has passed since your last penalty, your karma is reset and you will receive a regular chat restriction warning regardless of the severity of the next offense.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are too lazy to read this wall of text, **TL;DR**; _force players to be unable to type when they type bad things. the action must have a direct connotation to the penalty. If you punish a player with a penalty that has nothing to do with the offense, you will have accomplished nothing._ _enforce penalties that promote a less toxic game overall._\n\nIf you did bother to read this post, I appreciate it because I spent too much time on it.","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2019-03-09T05:49:47.912+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going to be honest here, if you have 30-35 permanent bans why should Riot be listening to you about any advice that you claim is made with the intention of making the game better?\n\nYour 30-35 bans is evidence to the direct contrary to that. You've been actively making the game a *worse* place over many more accounts than almost all other players. If you were interested in making the game a better place the first and easiest place to make that happen is with your own interactions in the game. Riot has already tried a punishment system that didn't involve permanent bans for chat related offences and it didn't pan out. It involved ever greater stacking chat restrictions.\n\nWhen players showed that they had no intention of behaving themselves, removing chat wasn't likely to suddenly make them behave. They just found other means to show malice towards the other players. These other means, such as intentional feeding or trolling, are much more difficult to detect, prove, and hold someone responsible for.\n\nSome people simply choose to not be civil towards others no matter what sort of punishment Riot could feasibly give. Under such circumstances it's best to just discourage them from playing entirely. You spinning your wheels for 30+ bans, with nothing to show for it other than that number, is not the standard.

No, it's not incredibly easy to detect intentional feeding. Some cases sure, but nowhere close to all of them with the level of certainty necessary to keep false positives low. You're also making a suggestion that is once again, nonviable. There are **millions** of games played per day. There is no amount of man-power (employed or otherwise) that will keep up with that even reasonably on a manual level. The Tribunal was an attempt to allow the community to judge cases, and those cases only involved the chat logs. And it **still** fell behind. Each case took at most 5 min to judge, you're suggesting something that will take several times longer than that and will require far more credentials to judge a case accurately.","replies":[{"poster":"EverythingIsGone","date":"2019-03-09T06:36:07.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":11,"body":"no, you're right, I have no interest in arguing with you. you're trying to argue with me for the sake of arguing with me. ints don't happen THAT often. intentionally feeding is definitely low on occurrence. low enough that it wouldn't take more than one person per region to do the job of hitting the ban hammer on inters.

If it was known which cases were intentional feeding or trolling there would be no need for a manual review at all. There are far more claims that someone was trolling/intentionally feeding than there are actual intentional feeders or troll.

This isn't a theory, it's based on the results of a previous iteration of the punishment.\n\nWe're talking about the players that blast past the first chat restriction, second chat restriction, 14-day ban, then perma-ban without turning the train around. And in your case players that have driven several trains into the perma-ban ravine. The players that learn their lesson tend to never even approach the perma-ban step.

You said in another comment that you'd watch a replay, so let's increase the time estimate to 20 minutes each.

This is still with the massive underestimation of one troll per week, with only the daily players encountering any trolls.\n\n> But then, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Span_of_control you have to start worrying a little bit about managing your employees. They have to set quotas, monitor quality of decisions, have meetings to distribute any new things your system identifies as toxic, mediate disputes, ect ect. So, let's say your employees are almost perfect, so you can have a 50:1 ratio of employees to managers.

Obsolete would imply that there's vastly better options available to achieve the same goal; reforming or removing toxic players. The system and punishment progression have largely worked well enough to not demand changes, and if they truly are obsolete, then you'd have to make a hell of a case for whatever new system you propose.\n\n2) That you have 30-35~ permanently banned accounts does not really confer any import to your statements over anyone else's. All it reads as is \"I've been on the short end of the punishment stick for a really long time and haven't changed to fit Riot's expectations for player behavior, and want to propose changes to that expectation/the enforcement of it.\"\n\nAnd, sure, I will give that having so many punishments to your name would invariably give you _some_ understanding of the punishment system; you'd likely be more acutely aware of what's punishable even despite your decision not to change it. But, then, that raises an issue; you _know_ the problem, and you _should_ know that it's a problem on _your_ end. Riot can't fix your problems for you, and frankly, it's hard to put stock in propositions from someone with such an outstanding issue.\n\n---\n\n> You might think, \"**why don't you just stop being toxic? then you don't have to worry about being permanently banned!**\" okay, but what if you can't? \"**then you have no place in this game**\" okay, sure.\n\nThe biggest issue with this argument is the presence of the word \"_if_\". \"If\" you can't change, then yes, you generally will not be welcome in League. But, here's the kicker: _Everyone **can** change._ There's no \"if\"s. If you are a human being, you have the capacity to change yourself. There are a blue billion people out there in the world who stand as examples of such.\n\nThe issue with change and reform, though, is that it relies on the person who _needs_ to change to actually _want_ to change. If you don't _want_ to change, you're not really going to put in the effort to do so, no matter how many incentives you're given to do so. To quote my late grandmother; \"_Nobody can change you but you._\"\n\n> Long story short, the ways Riot has tried to address player behavior is... poor. \"you can't get ranked rewards!\" I really don't care. \"you can't get hextech chests!\" I really don't care.\n\nThat _you_ don't care doesn't mean other people won't care. And believe you me, especially in the case of Ranked Rewards, _people do care_. I saw the influx of complaints at the end of the 2018 season when people realized that their misbehavior held tangible consequences, and that competition was not an excuse to be toxic.\n\nHell, [Riot even made a one-time reform offer](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/TGYs0hwO-2018-end-of-season-rewards-and-honor) _because_ those people realized too little and too late that being toxic doesn't pan out well.\n\nYou are one of a scant few people - and I really do mean scant few, since Riot's data says that roughly only 0.006~% of the playerbase receive a permanent ban, and you, as an individual, have had _30~_ - who has made a consistent effort to return to the game without making the effort to reform. Being blunt, you are a perfect example of an outlier. You are not a common individual, and that some of the reform incentives don't work for _you specifically_ does not mean anything compared to the playerbase as a whole.\n\n> You know what I care about? That feeling of dread having to queue up for a 20 minute game because I AFK'd. The penalty is the key. The reason this penalty works is because YOU made someone else's 20 minutes a waste of time, now YOU have to waste 20 minutes of YOUR time. **That is how you properly penalize a player**. _When the penalty has nothing to do with the offense_, it accomplishes nothing.\n\n\"When the penalty has nothing to do with the offense...\"\n\nI want to italicize that and point it out here, because I'm fairly confident I know where this is going. Bans for chat-related misbehavior. It's the only logical end conclusion from relating punishment directly to the offense. 20-minute LPQ penalty for wasting other peoples' 20~ minutes, restricted chat for chat misbehavior, inability to play the game for trolling and feeding/gameplay misbehavior.\n\nFor your statements on the punishment tiers;\n\n**Chat Restrictions -** There isn't really much to cover here, save to clarify that the chat restriction tiers are 10-game and 25-game. Generally speaking, _any_ punishment being lifted or cleared is going to provide some degree of catharsis, and I think in this case, the catharsis for clearing a chat restriction is primarily from the personal input to how quickly you clear it. You're still playing the games and making your own impact on the progress in the punishment, so naturally, you're going to feel relief when you do finally clear it.\n\nAs for incrementally escalating chat restrictions, I don't think that would really be feasible. After a certain point, Riot has to put their foot down to try and get the player to stop misbehaving, and simply adding more chat restriction tiers wouldn't really solve that. That's largely why they settled on the two tiers before a temporary ban; as you said, they're effective as a minor punishment for a minor infraction, but consistent misbehavior has to be met with something increasingly harsh.\n\n**14-day Suspensions -** In regards to your views on the punishment itself here, I do somewhat agree. I can definitely see 14 days being a bit overlong following the two lighter punishment tiers, but I also have to add the caveat that _with_ the combined rough durations of the previous two tiers, a 14-day ban _is_ still a natural step up in the punishment tiers.\n\nSince, assuming a person averages 3~ games per day, it'd take roughly 3~ days to clear the 10-game CR, and 8~ days to clear the 25-game CR, making for a sum-total of 11~ days of punishment. While doubling down does seem a bit much, I reckon that it's merited, given the circumstances.\n\nWith your viewpoints on the other stuff, not pertaining to the punishment tier, I disagree, both generally (in regards to toxic players not liking being toxic) and fundamentally (competition breeding anger/toxicity, + the idea of \"fixing\" players > removing bad apples.) I've already mentioned that people can only change if they decide to - Riot can't \"fix\" someone who doesn't want to be fixed, no matter how many incentives or specially-curated programs they work up.\n\nAt the end of the day, the problem isn't Riot's decision not to \"fix players\" or an inability to do so, it's the _player's_ decision not to change.\n\n**Permanent Suspensions -** Again, I have to invoke your status as an outlier; while there are certainly some people who will simply create a new account, and, worse still, those out there who'd make the short-term focused gamble of buying an account, the amount of people who get to that point is still comparatively low, and you are, as mentioned before, an even more isolated percentage of the playerbase.\n\nThat said, the permanent ban does, in fact, accomplish something. It sends the punished player the message \"if you can't play by the rules you agreed to, we can't have you playing at all. Please don't come back.\", and gives a massive, tangible punishment to people who invested anything into their account. All their hours of progress, their skins, their hard-earned Champions, etc. - gone.\n\nOf course, such a punishment will have no effect whatsoever on someone who simply ignores the penalties and just keeps coming back despite the permanent ban, but not every player will be like that.\n\nBefore I start discussing your proposal, I do want to clear up some information regarding the punishment system.\n\n> For those of you who don't know, suspensions are handed out based on how toxic you are in a certain period of time. After a certain amount of time (I'm not too sure on how much time, but roughly 3 months) of no incidents, it resets. If you chalk up 3 incidents of toxic chat logs within this timeframe, you get the ban hammer. It can potentially be less than 3 if your chat logs are severely toxic (such as hate speech or homophobic slurs), but generally it's 3. Chat restrictions work almost the exact same way, but for less serious chat-related incidents.\n\nThis is not entirely true, but not entirely false, either. Punishments are handed out based on _consistency_ and _severity_; there's some general, underlying math to the system where misbehavior will definitely turn up in valid reports, but the punishment will come based on those two factors mentioned above; how **severe** your offenses were, and how **consistent** your misbehavior is.\n\nConsistent, low-key toxicity (calling early GG's, passive-aggressive remarks, light insults) will ultimately earn the same degree of punishment as infrequent, inflammatory behavior (flaming, insults, harassment, etc.) - though not within the same timeframes, due to the nature of one being aggressive and the other one being less obtrusive.\n\nThe IFS will generally try to bring up 3 games worth of recent behavior that validated reports for a punishment, but this is where that timeframe thing actually comes up true, since you could have been punished for consistent misbehavior, but only got one game's logs of acting out. This has led to the perception that Riot is needlessly strict with even minor offenses due to the misunderstanding of how the reform cards work.\n\nTL;DR, you're punished for the severity and frequency of your offenses, and the IFS will try (but not always succeed) to produce 3 game's worth of chat logs to back up the punishment.\n\n---\n\nI'll have to continue this response in another comment in the string, as I've reached the character limit. ~~Bear with me for a little bit while I write the rest up.~~","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2019-03-09T07:27:23.312+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Continuing from the initial response due to character limit;\n\n---\n\nAs for your proposal, there are two major issues that are readily apparent. Of course, I again see the merit in implementing smaller-scale bans, but technically speaking, what we have right now is the most practical.\n\nThe first issue is one of perception; getting punished for the first game of misbehavior _every_ time, consistently, will change the perception of the system - and there are already people who view the _current_ system as too harsh, so you can imagine how quickly the perception would be skewed to the belief that the punishment system is overbearing, exceedingly harsh, and Big Brother-esque.\n\nOf course, there is merit to having consistent and reliable punishment, but frankly, having the punishments turn up as soon as a report comes back valid is doing it overmuch. That's not to say that the idea itself is bad, but it'd be better to try and find a middle-ground between your proposal and Riot's current ethos of leniency on the expectation of stress.\n\nSince, as it stands, yes, there is a bit of an issue with Riot's understanding that League is a stressful game, and some misbehavior forgiveness _is_ certainly warranted, but, again, there's definitely a point in between the two methodologies that I think could be an improvement to the system.\n\nThe other issue with your proposal is that, in general, having a ton of punishments simply isn't reliable when it comes to reforming people. And, this will be a little hypocritical considering that I've pointed out your status as an outlier previously, but for the sake of argument, take _you_ for example. You've had 30-35~ permanent suspensions, which, assuming you've gone through the entire punishment ladder every single time, that's _140_ punishments - 70 chat restrictions, and 70 suspensions.\n\nThis is largely what Riot understood when setting up the punishment system that has lasted for us to this day; they learned that simply layering on more and more punishments (as they found through the indefinitely-scaling Chat Restriction system) was not conducive to reform, and in fact worked largely _against_ the main point of the punishment. \n\nSo because they found that simply layering on more and more punishments didn't work, they decided to make a short and simple punishment ladder, one with a definitive \"end\" punishment - the permanent ban.\n\nI could see _some_ possibility of expanding the ladder, perhaps making a 5th punishment tier (somewhere behind the permanent ban, obviously), but having a system that simply continues applying punishments without a definitive \"x strikes, you're out\" punishment would both be ultimately fruitless (continuously layering punishments doesn't work) and result in a punishment system with no bite (why reform when I have nothing to lose from being toxic? No permaban = no real reason to worry about the repercussions for misbehavior.)\n\n---\n\nBeyond that, some other issues;\n\n1) **125-games chat restriction is ironically overdoing it, considering the previous math.** Again, assuming 3~ games per day, it would take roughly 8~ days to clear a 25-game chat restriction (give or take since 3 times 8 = 24), and _**41~**_ days to clear a 125-game chat restriction (again, give-or-take, since 3 times 8 = 24 times 5 = 40, +1 to account for an extra 3 game day.)\n\nThat's _way_ more time spent punished than a 14-day suspension, and you're proposing this as the _second punishment tier_.\n\n2) **Chat-muting wouldn't work.** I brought up Riot's previous experiment with indefinitely-scaling Chat Restrictions earlier, and now's the point where I have to expound on it further. At one point, Riot had the system simply give longer-duration chat restrictions ad-infinitum for chat-related punishments. So, continuous chat misbehavior would just result in a longer amount of time where players couldn't fully utilize the chat.\n\nIn theory, it's a sound design; restrict player's chat so they can't flame and have to use what little chat they could for strategic purposes. In practice, it failed miserably. Players under longer-duration CR's largely resorted to trolling and intentionally feeding to express their contempt for their teammates.\n\nAnd considering that the punishments in question were chat _restrictions_, that should say something about the viability of long duration chat _mutes_.\n\n3) **Having a specified timeframe with which to \"reform\" removes the edge punishments can have.** Currently, the system has an indeterminate timeframe of reform for de-escalating in the punishment tiers; in general, we (the community) estimate it to be around 3-6~ months of consistent, positive play. Knowing how long that timeframe actually is would open the system up to be gamed, and invite toxic players to simply abuse the system.\n\nNot knowing how long it is, though, leaves people uncertain of whether or not they're still on thin ice, and gives them a reason to think twice about what they're going to say in chat. There is of course some room for argument about the moral implications of fostering paranoia with the punishment system, but by and large, it does what it's supposed to do. People don't want to be punished, and not knowing whether or not they're back at the \"clean slate\" status makes them less likely to misbehave.\n\n---\n\nAll told, I will admit this much; while I largely disagree with your proposal, there is still stuff worth considering here, and you are, to a degree, correct in your assertions that your (unfortunate) circumstances and run-ins with the punishment system do give you a depth of understanding to posit worthwhile information on the system.\n\nHopefully others beyond myself will be able to take something away from your proposal, regardless of whether or not they agree with it. And, hopefully my response gives some food for thought (despite any instances of blunt or dismissive behavior I may've exhibited) or highlights some notable details about your proposal that you might take another look at.\n\nEither way, like you with your OP, I thank you for your time in reading and consideration.","replies":[{"poster":"EverythingIsGone","date":"2019-03-09T07:50:45.908+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I appreciated this write-up, it was a good read for sure :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-03-09T07:15:46.511+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"30 permabans doesn't lead me to think that you consider other people with your behavior.

Nothing bad will happen if you don't bother other people. In fact, you get punished if you bother other people, and rewarded if you don't. You choose to do this thing. Other people don't like it. They tell you as much, and yet you continue to do it. You think that just because it doesn't bother you, it shouldn't bother them, therefore they are wrong about what bothers them.\n\nYou \"suffer\" because Riot wants you to stop making others suffer. All you have to do is stop, and you don't, so you are punished in a way that prevents this. There is no additional punishment on top of what needs to be done to make you stop, and obviously it doesn't even go that far, because you just circumvent the punishment and do it again. Riot is being as nice to you as possible while still making an effort to preserve the gameplay experience for other players.\n\nYou got your first permaban because Riot told you to stop bothering other people (which many humans find objectionable per se, I might add) in their game that they run as a service that they own by allowing you to access an account that they own while allowing you to pay them to add RP that they still own to said account. You were warned that continuing to behave in this way would have certain consequences, but you kept going, until the logical outcome. This is called a consequence for your actions. It's like dropping a bowling ball on your foot. You've been told not to, but you did anyway, and now you're upset at the people who told you not to drop a bowling ball on your foot.

If someone just \"can't refrain\" from robbing banks, that means they will be pursued, tried, and possibly convicted and imprisoned, unless they can convince the jury that they need mental help, in which case they'd be confined to a mental institution while they get that help.

The reform card stating that the next punishment after the 14-day would be permanent weren't a clue, either? Most online services do permanently ban accounts that break the ToS, and LoL is no exception. The PB system tries to reform players by punishing unwanted behavior and rewarding desirable behavior. When it's clear that a player has no intention of following the ToS, their account is closed. The intent at that point is for the player to actually leave the game, but Riot has stated that they realize a player with sufficient motivation can just create another account.\n\n> Are you seriously trying to tell me that calling someone \"dumb\" is equivalent to a mass homicide?\n\nNo, I'm saying that you're bothering other people and complaining that there's some sort of negative effect for you.

Some people will notice that a floor is slippery and avoid slipping on it, but not everyone can, which is why that's an accident waiting to happen. And that's what a business can get sued for.\n\nIf you think it's a person's own fault for burning themselves with coffee that was far too hot to serve, and someone's own fault for being upset that someone was rude to them, do you not think it's someone's own fault for getting their account banned after repeatedly breaking the ToS? Everyone else should have personal responsibility, even extending to things for which they weren't really to blame, but not you? Everything is other people's fault?\n\nSticks and stones can break your bones, but the words \"your account has been permanently banned\" can never hurt you.\n\nYou're calling people \"sensitive little pussies\" when you posted a gigantic whine thread about being inconvenienced by repeated permabans.

Do not compare me to a fucking criminal. I am nothing of the sort.\n\nAgain, it's an analogy. You're repeatedly breaking rules, and there are consequences which you could not avoid.\n\n> Now you're patronizing me. You realize this is completely unprovoked, right? Hard to take you seriously when you continuously insult me in your 'argument'.. if I can even call it that, since you really haven't given me a valid reason as to why my proposal is wrong, you're just trying to defame me as if you had some sort of psychological vendetta.\n\nI'm not patronizing you. If you have an irrepressible need to rage and insult other people, it might behoove you to get help for that, in the same way that a person who stutters can improve their social life by getting some speech therapy, or a diabetic can preserve their health by working with a doctor to monitor their glucose, take insulin, and so on. If you could manage to be civil in your LoL matches, you'd be much more likely to hold onto an account for more than a few months, not to mention all the other positive interactions you could have with people in other places. Wouldn't you enjoy that?\n\nIf you think that a description of your behavior is defamation, perhaps you should take a moment to think about that behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"EverythingIsGone","date":"2019-03-09T10:20:45.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-03-09T10:25:08.506+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EverythingIsGone,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=N2d18Eiq,comment-id=00030000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-03-09T10:20:45.837+0000)\n>\n> This is a completely false statement. This also proves to me that you are truly oblivious to the productivity of the OP, and I _sincerely_ doubt you read much of it, if at all, or if you did, you read it with preconceived notions. You already knew what you were going to comment before clicking on the thread. I put several hours of work into theory and it's gone right past your head, and I find that genuinely offensive. With that being said, I could give a fuck less of anything you've left to say at this point. You're a sheep.\n\nThis kind of behavior is why you keep getting banned, and the fault here does not lie with the system. Unsurprisingly, you still haven't learned. Good luck in your future endeavors.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2019-03-11T21:53:16.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That case is taught in law schools not as a frivolous lawsuit, but an example of how the media can spin things.
