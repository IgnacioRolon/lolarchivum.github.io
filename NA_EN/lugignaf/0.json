The towers will attack each other, if there is nothing else around. Both towers otherwise function as normal.\r\n\r\n1. Destroy any tower to display the marks of summoning.\r\n2. Have both Azirs summon a tower within a short period of time on the same ruin.\r\n3. Observe both towers appearing in the same spot and fighting each other.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if the skins have to be different, but the time I saw it happen, they were both using different skins.\r\nUnfortunately I haven't been able to test this more than accidentally.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2014-09-23T00:39:22.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the report, this should be fixed in patch 4.18!

I've had this really screw me over on some walls/ganks where I quickly cast it expecting it to pop out on the other side, and instead it derp-dashes me into the wall with my E because my soldier is inside the wall.    I know at least 2 spot that do this, the top lane blue inner tower wall, and the bot lane purple inner tower wall.  Probably would happen at the tri-bush walls as well around the sidelanes.","replies":[]}]}
