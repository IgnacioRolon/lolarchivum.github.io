Coasting nicely, I'm living in the same place as back then, with the same internet.\r\nBut I'm bottlenecking down so hardcore right now while trying to download league. I opened overwatch and started updating hearthstone to see what my speeds were, 1.2mbps (I know thats low for some of you but its reality for me.) \r\n\r\nPause, close, disabled peer to peer and other factors for the league of legends client. \r\nBefore Peer 2 Peer disabled - downloaded from 900kps - 20kbps\r\nAfter p2p disabled - 900kbps - 70kbps.. and slowly going down more. \r\n\r\nWhy? I'm so confused by this. Sometimes it seems if I keep league as the main / only window open it'll go down slower. \r\nBut it still goes down, even with me just staring at it.\r\nIs there other settings I can adjust to get it on par with blizzards launcher?","replies":[{"poster":"Faeri Pinkett","date":"2017-08-21T14:34:49.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I'm really livid, just out of being a angry young adult probably.\nBut I remember two weeks ago I re-downloaded the entire black desert online.\nIt took me like, 9 hours. <_< \n\nIsn't bdo like double the size of league of legends? \n\nI also downloaded starcraft 2.. fortnite.. other games, all last week/week before that cause I was playing games a friend wanted to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-21T21:46:14.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This might be an issue where your network is getting routed in a bad way when it's coming to our servers, which might explain why our download is a bit slower than some others. You also mentioned having just downloaded BDO, SC2, and Fortnite just last week...so this may actually be a case of your ISP throttling your download speeds as well. \n\nLet's make sure we cover some of the basic troubleshooting steps first, so be sure to hit up our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). Pay close attention to the steps on port forwarding and setting up your DNS, and let me know if that's able to help that download speed.","replies":[{"poster":"Faeri Pinkett","date":"2017-08-22T03:20:13.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just attempted to do all of that, \nIt didn't help, I've submitted a ticket about it!","replies":[{"poster":"Faeri Pinkett","date":"2017-08-22T03:21:18.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I might just put league on a external harddrive and take it to the local library and download it... but this is definitely going to be a consistent issue.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Faeri Pinkett","date":"2017-08-21T10:01:20.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also note, it won't allow me to log into support apparently. Everything is peachy. \nI can't download the game, I can't submit a support ticket, I've done everything from DNS to running as admin. \nIs there a way I can just bulk download a zip-file with the entire game inside of it rather than relying on League servers to give it to me?","replies":[]}]}
