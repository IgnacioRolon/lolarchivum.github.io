Smurfing can lead to people of far higher skill levels playing in much lower tiers than they should which can lead to this behavior. Overall, there's a lot of ways that smurfs let people skirt the rules and systems in their favor. There's nothing I can personally do about smurfs, since everyone has the right to their account, but if they're acting this way I would personally report them in post-game for toxicity or boosting if they claim it. Always make use of reporting, otherwise, we can't take action.","replies":[{"poster":"Faeri Pinkett","date":"2017-10-03T06:49:07.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they're claiming to be a smurf, but not claiming to be boosting - \nIs it still bannable? \n\nI know riot has a code of \"It's shit talk in game.\" versus \"harassment.\" \nTrash talk is an integral part of \"competitive\" games so Its one of those things where I'm curious as to how you value or judge it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Skull King","date":"2017-10-02T12:26:00.647+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fairy Pinkett,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=6VqIaIth,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-10-02T09:36:57.952+0000)\n>\n> Does this sound familiar to any of you \n> &amp;quot;GG get rekt you piece of shit.&amp;quot; \n> &amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s not that i&amp;#039;m good, it&amp;#039;s just that you&amp;#039;re trash.&amp;quot;\n> &amp;quot;I&amp;#039;m only platinum, I&amp;#039;m just boosting my girlfriend up so she can duo with me on my main.&amp;quot; \n> &amp;quot;Look, my real account is ******* op.gg it, you&amp;#039;ll see i&amp;#039;m telling the truth.&amp;quot; \n> \n> - Checks their match history to see nothing but overwhelming positive kdas and winning streaks.\n\nI personally think smurfing is disgraceful because of the reasons you mentioned. They're allowed to make another account because they can no longer progress at their own rank/elo and ruin the experience for new players and they have to deal with basically what you typed there. Yeah what a way to start out in a new game by having a \"smurf\" calling them out the entire game on their lack of skill.","replies":[]}]}
