Comet for example requires most champions who do use it, to first land a skill shot and hope that the comet lands because Comet itself is a skill shot. Using it on a champions that’s not stunned, already moving, or has any speed buff will always miss.\n\nYet, your viewpoint for ADC, tanks, melee champions is that they need less requirements and barriers for their keystones to work. Press the attack doesn’t need any requirement bad to land 3 consecutive attacks. Why not add some “gameplay” to where people can dodge it? Grasp of the undying? Same thing!. Aery? Same thing\n\nGive AP who already are require to constantly land abilities less requirements for keystones to work\n\nIt’s ridiculous that when I’m playing Xerath to constantly land Q and seeing that Comet has not landed once because it’s easy to dodge","replies":[{"poster":"AgentBlack","date":"2017-12-07T23:06:41.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But if you're Xerath, you can just W first and land the Comet for free...","replies":[{"poster":"xJLx MCHammer","date":"2017-12-07T23:10:59.756+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zone0ut,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=djhhyIkO,comment-id=001a0004000000000000,timestamp=2017-12-07T23:06:41.053+0000)\n>\n> But if you&#x27;re Xerath, you can just W first and land the Comet for free...\n\nLol\nThe cd of W and Comet aren’t even the same\n\nWhat if I’m playing Brand?

It really feels like a rune meant for a utility mage or an enchanter and many who are forced to use it do so knowing it's because it's the \"only option\".\n\nComet has a different problem, in that unless you have a way of applying a CC, many champs can avoid it too easily. And in other cases its damage feels lackluster especially when the enemy CAN avoid it so much. And so they take Aery instead, which then feels suboptimal because they can't use the ally shield.\n\nThe main problem is it really feels like there's no rune for mages with little/unreliable cc and no ally utility.\n\nIf anything, I'd like to see Comet be stronger and even harder to hit and another rune introduced for other mages with little/unrelaible cc.\n\nEdit: I should complete my thoughts. Phase rush is not optimal on all mages, and this is not even in the running as a third option in my mind (not that I think it's bad, it's my fave rune on Syndra but it's definitely not for everyone)\n\nLogically, you'd think \"then try a different tree and keystone\" but the problem is that Electrocute is the only other logical choice; after all, Thunderlord's Decree was a great option on a lot of mages, but a whopping 50 second cooldown early on makes the rune almost unusable and not worth it for what's lost in trade potential in lane. Which again, is fine, I like the new Electrocute as a jungling option since you'd only ever gank every 50 seconds or so and it feels appropriately powerful.\n\nWe just REALLY need another rune for mages.
