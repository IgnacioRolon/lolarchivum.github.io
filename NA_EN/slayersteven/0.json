Now i've talked with a riot employee and they told me to do a bunch of stuff that doesn't work go figure. I know for fact it isn't my connection or my computer because i'm always on the internet as i have 2 screens. Riot really needs to fix this because I'm starting to get into 30 minute queue bans and it's extremely frustrated. I'm very upset that i lose points because of your server issue. i \nwant to hit gold before the season ends and this is making it near impossible especially when it happens while i'm in promo's. Riot please dont respond with a bunch of crap to try to fix it just fix the damn problem.\n\nPs. No I won't be submitting a ticket because this hasn't resolved anything. I already tried and he gave me a bunch of stuff to do that didn't work at all. They tell me it's my computer and my issue which it is clearly not.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-05T16:31:34.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if your internet is fine, it doesn't mean your network is immune to issues specifically staying connected to our servers.

I'm not the only person with this issue. Why are there so many of us stating the same issues? Riot won't take any blame for this and i'm not sure why fixing it such a big deal. I've tested my network multiple times has never ever EVER had any connectivity issue with any other game and or website except riot. Champ select is the only issue. in-game lag never happens to me neither does any other disruption other than champ select issues. I also have friends that have this exact issue. Please give me a fix but don't tell me to do what all other 100 riot employee's have told me to do. Also this is extremely annoying as I've already made a ticket as told to do and nothing resulted. tried many things regarding my network and even using the hex tech tool. It doesn't work. how about looking into the issue on your end?","replies":[]}]}]}
