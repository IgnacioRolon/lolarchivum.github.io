Then I think it was patch 7.2 the game suddenly, for reasons unknown to me, would have the hot corners on the mac enabled when playing league. whereas before the patch the hot corners would be disabled or not working when playing league as to help prevent unintended activation of the hot corner in MAC OS. (EX: playing lol and using free camera and moves the mouse to the bottom right corner and the hot corner for screensaver activates in my case.) Has anyone at riot been looking into this at all its becoming super frustrating having all my hot corners to speed up what I do for work be disabled when I go to play a game of league. Also, there is an issue of when the screensaver goes off automatically when a game is taking a longer than average time to load and causes the entire game process to have frame rate loss type lag but the FPS counter shows normal FPS. This is fixed by shutting down LOL game via  CMD> OPT> ESC and selecting league of legends. Does anyone know if there has been a fix for these two issues? Do I need to delete and reinstall league? I have tried to run restore to no avail. Thank you for reading this wall of text if anyone sees this.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-05T16:43:37.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, the hot corners is an issue that came up a few months ago.  It's specifically with Hot Corners itself, and in this case we've suggested disabling it while playing League to resolve it.  I haven't heard of the screensaver issue happening before, but it may be worth [disabling it ](http://appsliced.co/ask/how-do-i-disable-the-screen-saver-in-mac-os-x)also if necessary.  These issues are a result of the OS taking priority, and not necessarily caused by League.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"SP259","date":"2017-04-05T17:34:59.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks the the quick responseâ€‹. But yes the screensaver issue only happens when games take too long to load and the auto screensaver kicks in around a minute or so for me with inactive mouse/keyboard input. Also don't think this would change anything but I currently use the special league screen saver thing you guys made a while back. Doubt it would change anything because it's a Mac issue though.
