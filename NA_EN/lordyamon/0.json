I&#039;m a hardcore RTS player. I&#039;ve been playing RTSes since i was 5 years old starting with warcraft 2. I&#039;ve been playing league since early season 2 and I&#039;ve spent like 2,000 dollars on riot points. I&#039;ve never posted on the forums before because I never felt like I had anything to say.\r\nI will say that I love league of legends and it takes up most of my time and i&#039;m fine with that :P I really like riot and I think their moba is the best moba always thought it was the most unique and had the best art out of any other moba. My favorite thing about league of legends is the addition of runes and masteries which I think is a great concept being a warcraft 3 dota player.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve never really played ranked much due to the fact that as a hardcore gamer i never thought a team oriented game to be competitive.\r\n\r\nThis season I decided I was experienced enough to get to a decent rank, say Mid-Low Gold if I tried hard enough.\r\n\r\nTurns out I was right. I got to silver 1 with 90 lp from bronze 2 in a few weeks.\r\n\r\nBut after that something strange happened, I went from a 53% win ratio and almost in gold, to losing every single game all the way back down to silver V with -1 LP ( now 49% win ratio ) and I&#039;ve been stuck there for weeks and haven&#039;t advanced a single division/tier/bracket, anything.\r\n\r\nEvery single game I play I feel like the enemy team is better than mine. I&#039;ve played so many games with the exact same results, that it seems I can carry my team for about 45 minutes until the enemy team gets strong enough off of CS and objectives to to beat me 1v1 when I split push.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve also been laning against players with 1500 MMR so I can&#039;t get fed off of my lane ( I main Top ). Also most of the time I get ganked 5-6 times by the enemy jungler and mid laner while my jungler doesn&#039;t know how to set up his runes/masteries and can&#039;t clear the jungle. Or picks junglers that can&#039;t jungle in the current meta due to changes/reworks etc.\r\n\r\nI suspect something is wrong with my account/MMR or the match making system. This has been an ongoing problem for a pretty ridiculous amount of time. Evidence that makes me think this might be the case if the fact I made a smurf account and I&#039;ve played about 50 games and lost 4.\r\n\r\nHere are some examples ( just because there are few examples, doesn&#039;t mean this hasn&#039;t occurred often )\r\n\r\nI am not a &quot;salty&quot; player and I wouldn&#039;t of made this thread if I didn&#039;t think there was legitimate concern. I could be EXTREMELY unlucky but I mean i haven&#039;t walked under 1000 ladders, or dropped a bomb on a mirror factory.","replies":[{"poster":"Very Hard Engage","date":"2017-03-10T02:58:58.259+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"223W 240L\n\nwin 20 consecutive games and you'll fix your MMR no problem. and start gaining an even amount in either direction win or lose. \n\nriot isn't out to get people, you just have to be consistent or lucky at this point.\n\nbasically riot looks at all the games you've played, the more you play the smaller your gains and losses because it thinks it has a firm understanding of where you belong.\n\nunfortunately if you play enough in low silver or bronze you'll never escape because you literally have no idea what proper game mechanics look like.\n\ni suggest you watch a streamer play and just mimic what they do, in your preferred position ofc, and on your champion would be even better. i guarantee results if you stop doing whatever it is you usually do in games, and just do what they do.\n\nriot also takes into consideration who you are up against, if they are lower than you, you are expected to win. you're silver 5, your opponent is bronze 2, why wouldn't you outrageously stomp them? why would it even be close? because you made mistakes and played ham aggro, hence your 16 deaths. no1 gets 16 deaths without inting. \n\nthe biggest offense i see on your screen, 178cs after 54minutes. those are rookie numbers, you gotta pump those numbers way up.","replies":[{"poster":"LordYamon","date":"2017-03-10T03:05:25.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my laning opponent is always around 1500 MMR ( Op.GG says belongs in gold 1), I still beat him and win my lane.
