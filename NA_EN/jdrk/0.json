I cant afford a new laptop or PC for that matter and frankly I dont have to.\r\n\r\nI will also leave a poll to see how many agree that leaver-buster has to be updated.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-22T22:54:33.240+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regardless of the reason the disconnection happens, your absence from the match negatively impacts **everyone** involved in the match.
