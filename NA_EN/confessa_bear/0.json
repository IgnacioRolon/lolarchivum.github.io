I get the champ select pool in pro play is limited, yet I cant remember the last time this guy was not picked or banned in any game regardless of region. I dont think hes overpowered or anything but this cant be sitting well with Riot to have someone this prominently played constantly, especially as a non flex option. Someone like Karma is at least more understandable and yet even she isnt picked at nearly the same rate.","replies":[{"poster":"Tyren","date":"2016-08-17T22:47:13.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just adding to what other people have said, for a while Trundle was pick or ban, and Gnar counters the troll pretty hard in lane and as a much better team fight while in mega form.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2016-08-16T03:09:11.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just have no idea when gnar got such high play all of a sudden.

Gnar is a safe bet almost no matter the lane opponent so you minimize the chances of a surprise gank turning into tower first blood and a snowballed game. Plus some of the champions like ekko top that pushed gnar out of popularity are basically gone now so he's back on top by default almost.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rustling Bush","date":"2016-08-16T03:14:11.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EliteMantis17,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=9mKnzL0u,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-08-16T03:09:11.510+0000)\n>\n> I just have no idea when gnar got such high play all of a sudden.
