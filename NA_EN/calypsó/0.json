I have trouble laning against a Ryze because he no matter what he does, he outrades me still. Let&#039;s take a look at his kit shall we? \n\n1. **_His Passive: Ryze&rsquo;s spells deal additional damage based on his bonus mana, and his maximum mana is increased by a percentage of his ability power._** Nothing really new here. It&#039;s similar to the old Ryze&#039;s passive and whatnot.\n2. His Q. Basically his only nuke damage which is empowered by his E. His Q is a nuke skillshot. It&#039;s empowered by his E (which we will talk about later). It is crucial for Ryze to E+Q combo because the damage is increased exponentially. By exponentially, I mean A LOT. Anyways, another skill to his Q is whenever he uses 2 skills and then uses a Q, he gets a shield and some pretty darn fast movement speed. Keep in mind this skill WILL refresh every time you use \nyour E skill. \n3. His W: Like all the reworks and past reworks, this skill didn&#039;t really see much change besides a little tweak to his kit. Pretty self explanatory but I won&#039;t get into that because of time&#039;s sake. It&#039;s a point and click snare that lasts for 1 second. However if you use your E skill and then W to that target, the snare is doubled. \n4. His E: This is arguably sort of frustrating to me. Again, it&#039;s a point and click damage skill which empowers your skillset besides your ult and passive. _**Ryze releases an orb of pure magical power that damages an enemy and debuffs them. Ryze&#039;s spells have additional effects against the debuffed enemy.**_ His whole combo relies with this skill because without it, it wouldn&#039;t do much damage. This skill has a VERY short cooldown.\n5. His R: I don&#039;t have a problem with this really. _**Ryze creates a portal to a nearby location. After a few seconds, allies standing near the portal are teleported to the target location.**_ \n\nSo, that is his kit^ in a nutshell. I may be missing some key components, but it&#039;s late and I just want some advice winning against him. If you&#039;re familiar with trading, then you know you have to consider the minions, where you are, and how you&#039;re going to outrade him. Anyways, everytime I try to outrade him (regardless of what champion I play) he ALWAYS out trades me. E+W and I&#039;m snared for 2 seconds. Then he proceeds to Q, (gets him that shield and movement speed) then E Q and just runs. He gets a shield to soak the minion damage and the movement speed to re-position himself for that E + Q damage which is insane. All in all, I need some help laning against a Ryze assuming I have no jungle pressure.

He also has no sustain so going for poke works well. What you don't want to do is try and all in him he has too many tools to absorb damage and disengage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Waffletimewarp","date":"2017-01-30T05:17:37.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait for his next rework","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-30T04:56:51.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stay behind minions and he cant touch you, fall back if you see him prepping a minion wave with E.\n\nTry to keep waves strung out so he cant push them as easily, harass him as he goes in to cast EEQ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MLDzXnRRR","date":"2017-01-30T04:54:18.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You can kill him before his first back, then ask for ganks.","replies":[{"poster":"Calypsó","date":"2017-01-30T04:56:35.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MLDzXnRRR,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HFaP46gu,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-01-30T04:54:18.065+0000)\n>\n> You can kill him before his first back, then ask for ganks.\n\nPlease read to the end.
