(Season 7)","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"As the title suggests, are comebacks even possible? No matter how hard I try or my team tries, it just seems like comebacks aren&#039;t possible. I&#039;ve been playing since season 2-3 and I can safely say that comebacks were much easier back then. It just seems like this season, if a team has a big lead on the other team, it&#039;s an inevitable loss for the losing team. The only way they come back is when they actually make a big throw. I&#039;m talking about like if their adc decides to afk or they just get too cocky. Anyways, it&#039;s just a rant and I would love to hear some feedback.
