Also, Riot did try something similar to that with never ending chat restrictions but ultimately that didn't discourage people from behaving poorly. The line has to be drawn somewhere and in this case it's at a 2-week ban.\n\n>People who are toxic are actually PASSIONATE ABOUT THE GAME. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re so emotional when things aren&#x27;t going well. You get trolled by these people who get a rise of seeing you get irritated and then they get their duos to report you and try to get the other team to report you as well and just laugh and laugh and laugh while they&#x27;re doing it. \n\nIt's one thing to be passionate about something, it's another to be a jerk to other players while doing so. Lots of us get frustrated when things don't go very well for us, but allot of us also know not to take our angers and frustrations out on our teammates or opponents (the latter assuming you're using all-chat frequently in some of your games). For me personally I tend to just yell and rage at the screen whenever I get frustrated, as this way I can let my anger out in a way that doesn't compromise the state of the game for me or my teammates (i.e. we don't get distracted by my raging and can just focus on the game instead).\n\nAlso, when dealing a pre-made group of trolls the best thing to do is not give them the negative reaction that they're looking for from you. This way even if they do report you nothing will happen since you would have done nothing wrong to warrant a punishment. Is it easy to do? No. Is it possible to do? Yes.\n\n>This game is sooooo well put together the community is just so low tier. I have rarely seen people with honors medals on around their borders for being kind. \n\nWell hopefully this changes with the roll-out of the new Honors system. Me personally I still see them occasionally every now and then. They're not that common but they're out there.\n\n>RIOT. banning people permanently who have invested time and money into this game is such B/S.\n\nIt's actually not. Riot lets you use their product so long as you follow their rules. Those who don't aren't allowed to play their game. We get the whole \"but I spent money on this game\" argument allot here, usually from people who feel that money=immunity to the rules. To quote [Kei143](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/mmh6PidR-the-dreaded-downvoteers-in-this-discussion-board?comment=0001000100000000000100000004): \n\n>When Riot permabans someone, their philosophy is \"the chances of this guy reforming isn't a whole lot, we'd rather not have him in the game\". Thus in their eyes, they have already written off the toxic player as a paying client.\n\n>From a business standpoint, do they want to remove the toxic guy who has spent $500 but is causing a negative environment for 4-9 other players in every game? Those non-toxics are also spending $500 and probably will spend more, promote the game more when they are enjoying the game AND they won't cause a negative environment.\n\n>I personally think it is a fine argument to protect the ones that are paying money and aren't toxic rather than protecting the ones that may pay the same amount but are toxic.\n\n_______\n\n>I don&#x27;t know if anyone intends to go pro playing this game But I plan on it. That&#x27;s the whole reason i play it, I see it as a sport.

It&#x27;s farrrrrrrr tooooo easy to get banned on this game. This system needs to be reworked.\n\nEven in professional sports both traditional and electronic players are expected behave in a mature and respectful fashion when interacting with others. Those who don't face fines and/or suspensions from the game itself. For example, in League of Legends former professional player IWillDominate received a permanent ban for toxic behavior. Yes he later cleaned up his act and was allowed back into pro play because of it but his old accounts that were affected by this still remain banned to this day.\n\nIt's not that gaming companies are catering to carebears, it's that both the companies and communities are putting their feet down and stating \"we don't want players acting and behaving like jerks in our games\". Why? Because jerks not only ruin games for players but they also drive away potential business and customers from the company's product itself. You may think it's okay to be a jerk to other players but the majority of other players and companies don't. Times change, and if you find the rules too restricting for you then feel free to find another game to play that has less restrictive rules regarding player behavior.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2017-06-19T22:12:44.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I notice you didn't mention slurs. \n\nYou're \"passionate\", sure.
