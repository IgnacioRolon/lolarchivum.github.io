Players who have this have absolutely no incentive to reform, because even if they do, the punishment isn't removed. It didn't really matter how they behaved as the chat restriction would stay no matter what. So, they simply didn't change their behavior.\n\nOn top of that, when these players ran out of available messages to send, a large majority of them would simply resort to other forms of toxic behavior, like intentionally feeding, in order to vent their frustration. This is why Riot doesn't do permanent chat restrictions, as they simply do accomplish Riot's main goal, reform.\n\nAs for permanent bans, Riot does this when they feel that a player has shown no intention of changing their behavior after multiple warnings. As a result, they permanently ban them and want them to take their time and money elsewhere, because they don't want that behavior in their game.\n\nUnfortunately, there's nothing to stop these players from creating new accounts, which sucks, but if they continue to exhibit the same toxic behavior, they tend to be punished again fairly quickly. If they don't, then awesome.","replies":[{"poster":"TheNiceOne2","date":"2016-09-23T08:00:56.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"i never said the perma chat ban will solve all of the proplem but its defently better than a perma ban and ppl would 100% flame less(they might still flame yes but at least they flame less..)so you litterlay telling me its better to play like a bitchh instead of flaming ? cuz i see its obviosuly working in LoL","replies":[{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-09-23T08:25:38.408+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going to have to disagree with you on it being better than a permanent chat ban. Sure, people would flame less in chat, but as I said before, they would simply resort to other forms of toxic behavior when they started to get angry.\n\nBesides, Riot had something similar to this in the recent past, where players would receive continually increasing chat restrictions, to the point where it would take forever to work them off, so it was essentially a permanent chat ban. From Riot's own experience, they found this really didn't work, which is why they don't do it. \n\nAlso, if someone starts to flame you, flaming them back does not accomplish anything. All it is is fighting fire with fire, which only makes the situation worse. If someone is flaming you, the best response is to mute them and report them if you feel it necessary. If you want to interpret this as \"playing like a bitch\" then fine, that's up to you, but it is the proper, mature response to such a situation.","replies":[{"poster":"TheNiceOne2","date":"2016-09-23T08:43:45.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"idk if this was riot's first year to start perma account bans but i know if compared the number of toxic players with the perma ban and chat perma ban im sure they ll find the chat ban better ...
