So far, so (not) well. \r\nThe thing is, i am a traitor and play e.g. Dota 2 and CS:GO. And in both games, i dont have any connection issues. Anybody got an idea why thats the case? Is it because valve Server are \"better\" or is it a Problem of mine? \r\nThanks for help, your Maximus\r\n\r\nHey Leute, also ich habe folgendes Problem: \r\nIch habe Ping-Issues des Todes of doom,manchmal Geht der Ping richtig hoch auf werte 체ber 600 etc. Das Ding ist, ich bin ein Verr채ter. Ich zocke auch Dota und Counter Strike GO. In beiden F채llen habe ich aber immer einen leckeren 40/50 Ping und alles ist cool. Meine Frage ist, liegt das an mir und meiner Connection zu den Riotservern. Oder sind die Valveserver mir einfach wohl gesonnen? W체rde mich um eine Antwort freuen, euer Maximus","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-22T00:32:57.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awwwww there's no traitors here just because you play DOTA2! It sounds like your network is having problems getting a good signal with our servers, it doesn't mean there's anything wrong with your connection but the internet can be a pretty fickle mistress. Let's check up on your network really quick by updating some of your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), but definitely let me know if that doesn't seem to help!","replies":[]}]}
