I have been banned before due to being toxic, yes I'm not afraid to admit it. I get a message after each game saying, \"You are ineligible to earn loot due to previous behavioral restrictions.\" As the Mastery 6 &amp; 7 are also part of Hextech Crafting, will I never be able to get it? Or will I be able to remove this restriction if I don't flame? I've already stopped flaming most of the time. I'd really appreciate if someone could help me with this.","replies":[{"poster":"Wolfess","date":"2016-05-26T07:59:34.555+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"if I recall correctly, it's 3 months of positive (or non-negative I'd guess) feedback before you can start receiving hextech chests and keys from playing.\nthat, of course,  means ACTUAL reports.

If they make significant progress, the rewards will start to appear after games once more.\n\nI've seen people get lose these restrictions almost immediately, and then I've seen people keep onto them. I'm guessing it goes by a point system, where if you're commended for your actions (ie teamwork, honorable opponent, friendly etc) it reduces the amount of time you have to wait. However, don't quote me on that, as I don't actually know. \n\nKind regards, \nJungleRammusOnly\n{{champion:33}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:33}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-26T21:07:12.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently, Mastery Tokens are considered part of Hextech Loot.
