Since the beginning of preseason, I suffered from some connection issues, more specifically, a much higher average ping. Keep in mind I haven’t experienced these connectivity and FPS problems before the onset of preseason. The aforementioned problem was solved when I sent a support ticket, thanks to a helpful Rioter. Then I didn’t have any problems until Patch 7.24 came out. I started randomly disconnecting from games, which didn’t get solved by disconnecting and reconnecting to the game. In addition, I also started experiencing the FPS problems which quite a few people have been complaining about as well. I purchased a new PC just about a month ago, so I don’t think that it contributes to this issue. Lastly, these issues seem to occur in almost all my games, and I have lost quite a few winnable games due to it, so it discourages me from playing, knowing that I will probably not have a good time. Any suggestions to resolve this issue are appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-12T18:20:37.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to hear that the issues came back up.  :(  You should run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) on these impacted games so we can get a better overview by telling us if this is a connection or FPS issues.  It could certainly be both.\n\nIf packet loss or network issues or found, starting with the steps in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide is the safest first step!

Then I had issues during Zed and Talon games, where my FPS kept dropping. On that day, my average connection score was in the mid to high 50s, and low 60s. I didn't have any internet issues that day however, only FPS problems. The next day, I played a Vayne game where, after the first few minutes, I started to disconnect from the game literally about every minute, before it sorted itself out after a certain point (can't remember when, it was after they had pushed us till inhibs though) Some of my connection scores were in the low 80s, while 2 of the logs had a connection score of 0, for some reason. The last log of the day had a connection score of 44. The next day I played a Talon game, where I had FPS issues again. I only played one game that day yet there were two logs, same with the other days, there's one extra log. I had a connection score of 63 and 0 on the first and second log respectively. I hope I have provided the information required, thank you for offering your assistance.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-13T16:21:52.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thanks for the info!  Based on these details it sounds like you might have some bad network instability that's causing packet loss.  It doesn't disconnect you entirely but enough to make it seem like fps problems (especially if on Wi-fi).  Were you able to run through the steps in the connection guide?","replies":[{"poster":"Exsanguinate","date":"2017-12-14T14:19:46.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Played a Zoe game yesterday, and my FPS dropped to <10 like 2 to 3 times, but fortunately that was it, and it didn't disrupt the game at all, but it still happened. I don't think it just seems like FPS problems though, my FPS on the top right corner drops to <30 when I experience these issues. My lag report goes like this.\n**Last 30 days**\n_ISP Connection_\nConnection Score - 75\nLatency - 118 ms\nPacket Loss - 0.28%\nJitter - 0 ms\n_My Connection_\nConnection Score  - 62\nLatency - 120 ms\nPacket Loss - 1.04%\nJitter - 1 ms\nGames - 37\n**Last 7 days**\n_ISP Connection_\nConnection Score - 77\nLatency - 114 ms\nPacket Loss - 0.28%\nJitter - 0 ms\n_My Connection_\nConnection Score - 57\nLatency - 120 ms\nPacket Loss - 2.00%\nJitter - 1 ms\nGames - 5\nI do still play on a WiFi connection, as I'm yet to purchase a considerably long ethernet cable to connect to my Laptop :P I have only had connection issues in two games over the last thirty days, and I think the only thing I can do is get an ethernet cable, but what about the FPS issues then? They have been the major problem in my last few games. Is it just a problem with preseason which will be sorted out or is it something else?
