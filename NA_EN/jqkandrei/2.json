If the target isn't Frosted (slowed) prior to the first arrow of flurry, the first arrow only deals 100% of damage and the other 4 arrows deal bonus damage.\n\nIt also seems like the on-hit damage from Runaan's Hurricane's bolt is only applied once per flurry, as I didn't see more than 75 damage per flurry (in fact it's much less than 75) when using Q and Runaan's Hurricane's bolts on a minion with 0 armor the last time I did my testing.
