If we do get a deer champ, I would assume it would be the \"Ivory Stag\" old god in Coven Lissandra's lore, when said champ gets that skin. If we don't get a deer champ though, someone once said that she hoped the Ivory Stag wouldn't be Thresh, but unless we get a new deer champ I think it will be.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2019-04-14T11:46:40.737+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd like something similar to a dryad.\n\nhttps://cdn.blizzardwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/lunara-base-full.jpg\n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/CwcWzZzWgAkKSuP.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"y0r1ck","date":"2019-04-14T15:36:37.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PaladinNO,realm=EUNE,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=mFwmT5tB,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2019-04-14T11:46:40.737+0000)\n>\n> https://cdn.blizzardwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/lunara-base-full.jpg\n> \n> https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CwcWzZzWgAkKSuP.jpg\n\nYeah I was just about to say, Hecarim already has a skin like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Good Book","date":"2019-04-14T17:13:06.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"y0r1ck","date":"2019-04-14T17:45:34.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Good Book,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=mFwmT5tB,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2019-04-14T17:13:06.456+0000)\n>\n> But that's a skin.\n\nBut it's already in the game.

Zyra is poison ivy from Batman. Maokai is the stereotypical defensive ent. Ivern is the Tom Bombadil of LoL.\n\nI guess there could be a deer character, it's not up to you or me in the end.\n\nI'm just saying I think it's too similar in shape to Hecarim, especially when he's already got a deer-like skin, to be seriously considered.","replies":[{"poster":"4 Step Cadence","date":"2019-04-14T18:33:35.145+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hecarim is a centaur, and I don't think that's what OP is looking for with this deer character.\n\nThey want either a spirit(which I guess would appear like {{champion:432}}{{champion:203}}{{champion:16}}, or just a deer), a Vastaya({{champion:103}}{{champion:267}}{{champion:518}}), or an humanoid animal(not Vastaya, like {{champion:516}}{{champion:106}}{{champion:12}}).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-04-14T06:33:07.052+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"What would its ult be?
