This player went 0/17. I tried to help with positive advice before the person ran it down mid. Didn&#039;t care. I will admit it could come off as disrespectful but it was not intended that way. Her and her duo partner report me and I get chat restricted.  I&#039;ll post the chat a little later, but guess what happened to the 0/17 top laner?!?!?! NOTHING!!!!!!! Riot decided to do nothing to this person. I checked her game log and this person has played quite a few games since the 0/17 experience. I&#039;ve been playing for almost five years and I&#039;ve honestly lost a little respect for RIOT. I even tried to fight this ridiculous chat restriction through player support. Nothing was done. In the end I was told to say nothing to players like this and report them so RIOT can take of them. Still NOTHING was done. Ticket status: CLOSED.\n\nThe other people on my team were responding. This wasn't all a one sided conversation. Riot only shows what I wrote which also doesn't seem right. There was more to this show. (The Jax thing was a separate issue. We died bot lane and he dives 1v3 under turret.)\n\nReported Text:\n\nGame 1\nWhiteAsWondabreD: you a pro jax player?\nWhiteAsWondabreD: jax, if you're going to do that stay away from our lane\nWhiteAsWondabreD: that was pro silly\nWhiteAsWondabreD: you a smurf?\nWhiteAsWondabreD: your history shows lvl 14\nWhiteAsWondabreD: illaoi can i give you a tip?\nWhiteAsWondabreD: inting and doing what you are doing gets you reported\nWhiteAsWondabreD: if you are losing lane and jg won't help you then roam\nWhiteAsWondabreD: a good player will roam to another lane and make a difference\nWhiteAsWondabreD: the game is not over yet\nWhiteAsWondabreD: you can still make a difference\nWhiteAsWondabreD: does not matter if it's normals or not\nWhiteAsWondabreD: you should play to win\nWhiteAsWondabreD: i'd be willing to bet you do this in ranked too\nWhiteAsWondabreD: just afk\nWhiteAsWondabreD: at least then you're not helping them\nWhiteAsWondabreD: is it really?\nWhiteAsWondabreD: if you're being honest with yourself, you lose lane then think i know this will be fu\nWhiteAsWondabreD: whatever you're trash\nWhiteAsWondabreD: have fun in school tomorrow. seriously hope you learn something\nWhiteAsWondabreD: please report this illaoi\nWhiteAsWondabreD: this is killing the whole game\nWhiteAsWondabreD: we arent' feedin\nWhiteAsWondabreD: we are actually playing, you don't see a difference in what we are doing?\nWhiteAsWondabreD: does it matter anymore?\nWhiteAsWondabreD: diana are you playing with illaoi?\nWhiteAsWondabreD: the only one to defend such garbage\nWhiteAsWondabreD: ii figured\nWhiteAsWondabreD: no comparison\nWhiteAsWondabreD: i would never do wht you are doing\nWhiteAsWondabreD: just want to play a game\n","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2018-04-20T11:51:42.069+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is usually a delay in punishments for gameplay toxicity (trolling/inting) because they don't want to ban those who are just bad. \n\nAd for the ticket, yes it will be closed because they won't tell others if a specific account was banned.

My whole argument is that what few things I said versus the feed, the feed was by far worse and that person goes unpunished. I posted the chat above. It may not be good, but it's not half as bad as some of the things I've reported people on or that any of us have seen. There should be more immediate responses from the automated system if the person specifically says they're going to run it down mid then go 0/17.

If I were to poll any LoL player, what do you feel should be punished more? Someone you can mute and you have that control or someone who feeds the game to the other team? For me it's easy. If someone says something I don't like I have control over their chat and pings. This person who felt it necessary to throw the game ruined the experience for everyone. I guarantee my participation in anything negative is low. Everyone seems to be defending feeding behavior. I don't remember the last time I honored someone for inting.","replies":[{"poster":"Karunamon","date":"2018-04-20T15:16:38.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What part of \"Bad chat detection is always going to work better than inting detection\" was I unclear on?

Again, the guy fed 0/17 ran it down mid on purpose. Chat restriction aside, the guy purposely threw that game. Not a single person including you even looks at the situation with the feeder. Oh you got chat restricted...no crap. What did the 0/17 feed get? Nothing. My whole point has been that and not even your keen detection skills can lock that down. Lee Sin could even see this was a crap. You seem to be perfectly fine with the guy doing  this but watch your chat because that is by far worse.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
