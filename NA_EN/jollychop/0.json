I had just won 2 of my first games of the day and it just started closing out the game window and giving me an error message talking about video drivers\n   \nI checked my video drivers and theyre all up to date.  I even manually uploaded a driver i dont even think I need just to be sure and it didnt fix it.  Turned off my fire wall and nothing changes.  On my second attempt to start a game the LoL \nclient said something to the point of it downscaling to the old client,  whatever that may mean, and I had to update the actual league client, but that didnt fix it either.  Help pls.  I dont know how many reports have been sent in on me from this.\n\nTried to do one more game with some thing I thought would fix it and this is what the error message says.\n\nAn Unknown DirectX error has occurred and League of Legends cannot start.  Please make sure your video card is using the latest video drivers from the manufacturer.\n\nend of error message.
