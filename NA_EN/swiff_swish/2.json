I was wondering since it takes a long time to get your honor back up and I just got back to honor 3 a couple days ago. Will I still get the ward?","replies":[{"poster":"Desonance","date":"2017-11-08T01:17:07.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Swiff Swish,\n\nThe honor wards are a part of the [end-of-season rewards](https://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/2017-ranked-season-ends). If you finish the season, which ends tonight, silver or higher with honor level 3 or higher then you will receive your honor ward reward.\n[Outlined last month](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011781068-2017-Ranked-Rewards-Eligibility), players with bans or chat restrictions active when the season ends are ineligible for this year’s rewards.\nPlayers issued a ban of seven days or more from 8/22/2017 are ineligible for this year’s rewards. Bans that started before 8/22/2017 will not disqualify a player, even if the ban period extended past that date.\nPlayers banned for boosting during the 2017 season remain ineligible for rewards.\n\nVery Respectfully,\nDesonance","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-08T01:36:04.745+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to butt in Desonance, but this isn't quite 100% correct.\n\nFirst off, you **DO NOT** need Silver in a queue to get the Honor Ward skin reward for being honorable. The Silver requirement is for the Victorious Ward Skin.\n\nSecond, being disqualified from ranked rewards **DOES NOT** disqualify you from Honor rewards. These are separate rewards being given out for achieving different things.\n\nHate to be 'that poro', just don't want mass confusion once rewards start rolling out xD!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-08T21:34:47.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"YEEEEAAAAAAA SO THIS IS AWKWARD XD\n\n# #DESONANCEWASRIGHT    ","replies":[{"poster":"Swiff Swish","date":"2017-11-08T22:27:44.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=RoEkQU7I,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-11-08T21:34:47.942+0000)\n>\n> YEEEEAAAAAAA SO THIS IS AWKWARD XD\n> \n> # #DESONANCEWASRIGHT\n\nok! lol","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Desonance","date":"2017-11-08T21:41:22.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*flex* :P","replies":[]}]}
