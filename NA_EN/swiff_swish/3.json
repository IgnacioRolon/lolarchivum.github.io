It actually says I do not have enough RP/IP when I scan over all 6300 champions but I have exactly 6301 IP and that should allow me to buy him. I put this in help and support because idk if it is a bug. It says exactly this when I try to buy him: \"Your purchase could not be completed at this time.\" Please help!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-15T22:22:46.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like the client may have not visually updated after a recent purchase, therefore it's displaying an IP balance that's not accurate. I recommend relaunching your client, then attempt to buy something. This often results in the client updating the IP balance after syncing it with the server. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Swiff Swish","date":"2016-08-20T20:22:20.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello again! Well after a couple of days I was able to buy him, but my IP didn't disappear. Just last night it fixed itself and re-synced. It seems some of my other friends are having this problem. I think this is more than just needing to relaunch considering I did that and it didn't fix itself. Something off with the sync probably, I would suggest you would look into it.\n\n-Swiffer_Sweeper","replies":[]}]}]}
