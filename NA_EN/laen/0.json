I was able to uninstall the alpha client, but now I can't uninstall the actual game.  When I try, a message pops up saying \"the feature you are trying to use is on a network resource that is unavailable\" and it can't find the installation package \"LoL.NA.msi\".  I've tried using the Hextech Repair Tool and uninstalling manually through the Control Panel; both give me that message.  I always install programs to their default file locations, so I have no clue what's going on.  Anybody know how to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-15T05:53:26.596+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, we may have to end up escalating this to one of our tech specialists, but I'd like you to try using [Revo Uninstaller](http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html) or [Wise Uninstaller](http://www.wisecleaner.com/wise-program-uninstaller.html) to try a different approach for the uninstall. \n\nLet me know if this worked.","replies":[{"poster":"Laen","date":"2016-11-15T23:48:10.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, perhaps I spoke too soon.
