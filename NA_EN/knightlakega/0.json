You literally can't say anything without it being \"negative\" behavior/bannable.","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":3,"down_votes":17,"body":"I'll copy paste the game chat below, but this just seems a next level stupid... This is a good example how Riot is allowing the community to destroy itself.. \nRiot won't stand up and say \"yea, we see you were trolled, and flamed, and cheated by your team, and you were only defending yourself, and trying to communicate\" and pull the ban back.. Instead I get a copy pasted response... \"Sorry two wrongs don't make a right!\" \n\nNote, that right now it's only a chat ban, but still.. that's honor lost, (yea I know its not a big deal as a whole), but what gets me, is if little things like this can get me chat banned, enough of these \"little\" things can result in a perma ban down the road because of how Riots perma ban system works. (Enough normal chat bans will result in a perma ban). So imagine me after this chat ban is lifted, I dare suggest my mid lane, or adc didn't do anything i a gank, whole team white knights and reports me, and this then perma bans me for literally saying nothing but the facts of whats going on. \n\nNote 2: This is exactly how my friends account was perma banned. They never swore at anyone, they just said the facts of what was going on, and got teams royally flaming him for it just as I did which you'll see below. After a year of these chat bans that were ridiculous as a whole, he was perma banned. \n\n-----------------------------------------\nI will quote something which Support responded with, so keep this in mind of how ridiculous this is in response to the things below: \n\n\"In your case, I do see that you insulted other players, criticized them for their performance, called them out on their behavior, and taunted them. This type of behavior did add negativity to your game and the chat restriction was put in place to draw attention to that. I'm sorry to say but with that in mind, the chat restriction was appropriately placed, and I won't be able to remove it from your account.\"\n\nSo lets keep things in mind. Apparently to Riot support you cannot. \n\n1) **Call them out on their behavior.** Even saying they're being a toxic troll, is infact a bannable offense... (Which you see in the chats below. The enemy Olaf said in response to me saying \"ffs, I clicked smite twice\" missing my smite due to lag spikes he said \"sucks to suck\" in which I replied \"ah, you're just a toxic troll\", and that was that.. Never said anything else.. \n\n2) **Criticize their performance.** I didn't really \"criticize\" anyones performance, I only said whats what... The ADC afked in lane during a gank.. Vlad mid led his enemy Zyra roam into the river 3 times to kill me on low health, and he watched them do this and did nothing about it.. This set me behind by 3 levels, and way behind on cs and items. That's literally all I said in terms of criticizing anything.. But apparently that's bannable... \n\n3) **Insulted Other players** Besides the \"Everything can be taken as an insult\" where did I actually insult anyone? Apart from me thinking Cait was a bot, for literally afk autoing minions (legit mistake on my part, which once they started talking, I drew back on and didn't say a thing after that and let it go). In fact, once I realized they were not in-fact a bot, but just I suppose a very poor player, or a very new player (I didn't know which, and even people with disabilities have every right to play with me, so its cool right?), I tried to help them as much as possible by eating more binds, and skillshots and doing everything I could to help them get away.. Yet this is apparently toxic? \n\n4) **Taunted Them** This I think was in response to me saying \"dude just dodge lol\"... To put things into perspective, I was playing Leona support, with the afking cait who I thought was a bot, was proven wrong when they started typing, and left it at that. I said nothing negative about cait after I saw they were not a bot like I first thought, Morde starts SLAMMING into me about how I \"Eat every skillshot\", and how garbage and trash I am.. and to \"Just dodge and stop being trash\". \n\nI do respond with, its my job to eat snares, and skillshots that are going to hit my adc... (Cait literally got hit by every single skillshot in bot lane, so I started eating them for her, because again, afking, and running straight away from a skillshot not even trying to dodge it.. (how could I not think they were a bot at first? I do apologize, but seriously...)) \n\nThis was after I died under tower, again eating a skillshot for my cait as we got tower dove 3v2, (she ran away if I remember correctly) and I died. \n\nMorde quite humorously started having the same happen to him, and to show my point I simply said \"dude just dodge\" a few times when I saw it happen near me, to make a point.. But I didn't chastise or lay into him in anyway.. literally 1 comment.. \n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nSince Riot in all their wisdom, decides NOT to have time stamps on the chat, this can result in some things looking toxic, that aren't, and I want to explain a few points in the chat so you understand the context. \n\nFor example in Game 1 right at the start: \n\n- Our Adc is like dial up tone. \n-ffs\n-clicked smite twice, never activated. \n\nDepending on where you put ffs, it can be either be toxic, or me irritated about a situation. If i had said \"our adc is like dial up tone, ffs\" that'd be me calling out my adc's actions. (To note, they literally just autoed minions during my entire gank, the support tried to help while the adc literally just sat autoing minions as if they were afk, hence the dial up tone joke). This could be seen as \"toxic\" I suppose, it'd be a pretty light version of it, but that's not what happened. I made the joke on its own. That's it.. \n\nI said ffs, clicked smite twice, never activated. This was in comment to Olaf jungle coming up to dragon and smiting it. I was getting a ping bounce from 40 to 300, and everywhere in between for a short while, unfortunately it happened during the drake fight and olaf was able to come nab it. It sucks, it happens. \n\nIt was at this point the team went full toxic mode, and never let up their insults, flames, and complete bashing of me in every way, (despite the fact that I was for a time the only positive, I ganked several times, and except for the drake miss, I wasn't doing bad at all). \n\nI'm not going to lie.. I don't know what it is about League, or leagues community, but if the adc had said anything in retort to my \"adc is like dial up tone\" joke, I'd of literally just said \"chill, I was just joking cuz it seemed like you were afk\". and that's that...\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThe only time I almost decide \"Screw this\" and get a little itchy myself is when my whole team kept saying \"dude just afk, you're trash, go away we dont want you here\". In which case I said \"I'm thinking of just afking at this point\", then a few minutes later of my team continueing with \"good just go away you're @#$#\" (again despite me being the only positive k/d/a on the team and actively ganking for them.... all cuz I missed 1 drake due to latency issues...) I said in all chat \"I'm just gonna afk I think\" or something on that note.. I didn't actualy afk.. for even a second.. right after writing that I thought, ehhh whatever. I don't want to get hammered for being a poor sport, so I kept going. (Note, even the enemy team at the end supported me for dealing with my teammates. Even THEY saw how toxic they were, and said it was good on me for not afking like I wanted too..) \n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nIn Conclusion, the only thing I can take from this is that Riot doesn't give 2 F's.. they're allowing the community to go down by striking everyone, regardless of content, intent, or actions.. Sure I made the mistake of thinking the cait was a bot, but I legit thought that, my actions afterwords, and the fact I never once said anything towards cait after I was proven wrong shows it was a legit mistake. The fact I then did everything I could to be the best support for them again shows my good intent.. as an example... \n\nYou can't say ANYTHING.. even communicate.. The Vvlad who let Zyra roam slightly into the river to kill me low on hp 3 times or so, and did nothing, then decided to trash me about it, when all I did was point out that him letting zyra do that is getting me way behind everyone else.. (the Olaf Jungle was 3 levels ahead of me at one point because of it, and I still had a betta kda than anyone else being 3-4 levels behind.. I was literally doing everything I could to be a good team player despite). \n\nBut apparently to Riot Support, that's a no no.. no you can't and I quote directly \"criticized them for their performance\" Apparently is what they consider simply saying facts surrounding my situation in defense of them insulting and attacking me....  \n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nThat's the gist of the main points of the 2 games... I'll just copy paste the game content here.... But I really think 1) context of the words matters, (which Riot seems to not give 2 F's about), and 2) Communication isn't always nice to hear, but its important to communicate, sometimes you don't want to hear you went derp on a gank and didn't respond, and got called out on it (not even in a negative way), but any functioning human being should able to not turn that into a negative experience to the level the business has to step in and chastise the person who dared mention it the mistake... \n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nA few minor points that's easily taken out of context because you can't see the situation/other peoples chat. \n\n- \"I can't get better with teams like this\" was in response to my teammates saying \"dude just stop being trash, and someday you'll get better\" \"own up to your mistakes, and stop sucking\" (The mistake of my missing drake, which I do own up too). Literally can't practice, or get better when my whole team is flaming me, insulting me, and not responding to my ganks to spite me.. This is just a fact... There's nothing I can do about it, but focus on what I can do, which is clearing jungle, and ganking when I can.. Hard to get better when the whole team is actively trying to spite you and mess you up. \n\n- \"No I gave him the kill on purpose\" is in response to giving a teammate a kill, not me giving a death over to the enemy team. \n\n- The points of Game 2 with cait, again were because I thought legit they were a bot for the first 10 minutes.. The way they were playing just seemed off, not responding to ganks, autoing non stop, constantly getting hit with max range lux binds and not even trying to dodge, and getting caught out in ganks while I was already out of dodge, and they were still sitting autoing.. \n\nIn response to \"Against this cait that's not saying much\", was to soraka who kept slamming me and trolling me for how bad of a support I was, and how she had so many kills and no deaths.. Again with a cait who didn't fight, and kept autoing all the time, and dieing even after I ate all the skillshots and binds.. \n\nThis is the one time I would admit I was a little \"negative\" about the whole situation and teammate, but again... This isn't what Riot was slamming me for, it was multitude of things... If it was this 1 response against cait, sure.. I'd understand... \n\n\n\nGame 1\nIn-Game\nKnightLakega: and our adc is like dial up tone\nKnightLakega: ffs\nKnightLakega: clicked smite twice, never activated\nKnightLakega: ah you're a toxic troll\nKnightLakega: I'm about ready to just afk\nKnightLakega: dont need to get better\nKnightLakega: cant get better with teams like this\nKnightLakega: imagine thinking this is toxic lol\nKnightLakega: exactly\nKnightLakega: may as well not waste my time lol\nKnightLakega: just chill\nKnightLakega: well i'm 2 levels behind olaf now cuz of vlad this is nice\nKnightLakega: it is\nKnightLakega: how will you get better if you dont take the blame for your mistakes?\nKnightLakega: you let your mid kill me twice\nKnightLakega: cuz I been busy trying to help bot and mid lol\nKnightLakega: but vlad fked me twice so hard I can't gank top now sorry\nKnightLakega: whole temas flaming me, and asking me to afk\nKnightLakega: so I think I will\nKnightLakega: have fun guys\nKnightLakega: no lol I gave him the kill on purpose dude\nKnightLakega: he's 2 levels up\nKnightLakega: cuz you didn't want to wanter 2 inches from mid lane to help me kill your laner\nKnightLakega: yea which is why I tried to help, but naw illois is now complaining I didn't help top, while vlad sat and watched\nKnightLakega: zyra come and kill me twice and did nothing\nKnightLakega: naturlaly its all my fault though\nKnightLakega: dude didn't do crap to help lol\nKnightLakega: just watched\nKnightLakega: I'm not tilted lol\nKnightLakega: just not gonna take the abuse from a team\nKnightLakega: I didn't blame anyone for my own fuck ups\nKnightLakega: I took the blame for the dragon\nKnightLakega: I asked wtf to vlad who kept letting zyra wander into river to kill me constantly and did nothing\nKnightLakega: and because vlad did that, I'm now 2 leevels behidn olaf who is taking all my jungle.. if you can't seriously follow that simple logic\nKnightLakega: I can't help you dude\nKnightLakega: right?\nKnightLakega: ty\nKnightLakega: doing what I can\nKnightLakega: ty\nKnightLakega: because I admitted to my f up on the dragon?
