Whether or not walking is blocked by it, I'm not sure, but I would assume so.","replies":[{"poster":"SpaceyGlue","date":"2017-12-22T05:59:15.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just to clarify...its before it leaps when u have your friendly minion wave it has to kill first before the leap. she can use ultimate and it doesnt stop it lol","replies":[]}]}]}]}
