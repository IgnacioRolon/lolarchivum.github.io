I made the same assumption, but if you received a notification saying that you were banned and you are unsure why then the only solution really is to submit another ticket. It's possible Riot could've missed you, please re-submit a ticket.\n\nAfter this ticket and you have still have not gotten reply there isn't much you can do. You could re-submit a ticket again or get a new account and get on the rift. You could try to get in contact with someone on the board who works for Riot, if you find a discussion where a Riot worker has replied you can ask them.","replies":[]}]}
