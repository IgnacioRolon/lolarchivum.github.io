Here in the Bronze V MMR Unranked elo, at 20/25 minutes both teams decide that the only thing that can possibly be correct is to constantly and permanently group up mid. Did you just take mid inhib? Better 5 man mid instead of taking down toplane which has a massive minion wave while mid shoves itself. Minions going to take our bot tower/inhib? Who cares! Push mid! Enter Banner of Command, savior of the Bronze V MMR unranked players like me out there. Put a promotion on a siege minion on one of the side lanes and you are practically guaranteed to take a tower without doing anything else, and gain a crum load of gold while you&#039;re at it. \r\n\r\nPlus it&#039;s hilarious watching a Ziggs try to kill the promoted minion and then reporting you for hacking when the minion doesn&#039;t get hurt by the bombs XD\r\nLong and short I love building the item even if it&#039;s not actually that fantastic. It gets you a lot of gold as a support, provides great map pressure and I lol every time my super minion takes a tower. \r\nThanks for reading, have a wonderful day!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2016-02-29T17:40:01.311+0000","up_votes":72,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Plus it's hilarious watching a Ziggs try to kill the promoted minion and then reporting you for hacking when the minion doesn't get hurt by the bombs XD\n\nPoor Ziggs.
