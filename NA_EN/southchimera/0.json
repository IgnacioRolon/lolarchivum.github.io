The definition of a typo is the *unintentional* incorrect pressing of a key. It is impossible for someone who is typing to have their finger **that** far away from the intended key unintentionally, unless they were “sight typing” (i.e. looking at each key they press with one finger instead of “speed typing” by memory), in which case they would **see** themselves being that far away from the correct key.

For example, what if the OP was using &quot;engrish&quot; as a general insult and thus would use it against any race?\n\nThe insult is based on the mistake of using the phoneme /r/ instead of the phoneme /l/. A quick google search confirms that the scholarly consensus is that this only happens in people whose first language is of sino-Japanese or other Asian language families. It was not a general insult. Period.\n\n> 3. You are being racist by implying &quot;engrish&quot; can only insult ONE SPECIFIC RACE.\n\nDoes “Black” insult one specific race? How about the “n word” when used against someone of black skin color? Black is not a race. Nor is “African”. Those words are universally considered racist when used to insult people who are black. Racism does not have to be against only one race, and in fact, does not have to be against a specific race at all. The implication that some races are less than others, even if the specific race(s) which are superior is/are not specified, is racist.\n \n> 4. You keep ignoring that you aren&#x27;t allowed context. It&#x27;s a chat filter. Either the word is allowed or it is flagged. There is no middle ground. \n\nThis is like saying “because the police arrested someone on a murder charge which they did not have reasonable cause to do, then in the course of an investigation in which they broke no rules discovered legitimate evidence of murder, the charge is invalid”. Just because the original punishment was issued without context does not make it invalid. If you wish to have a discussion over the system, that is a subject for another thread - having such a conversation on this thread is spam and thread hijacking as the purpose of this thread is discussing OP’s **specific** punishment validity - which enables us to verify context.\n\n> Fake science.\n\nThis isn’t science, it is fact based on observation. Science implies some statistical or other analysis or hypothesis was used. The OP used the words to make fun of others for speaking in another language. Period.\n\n> There is virtually no context in this case. We have chat logs from 1 person. That is not the full story of the situation.\n\nYou do not need the other chat logs when the OP themselves admitted they did it only because others were “speaking nonsense”.\n\n> EDIT: Do I even have to mention the possibility those 1 chat logs we have were doctored?\n\nWhy would someone edit their chat logs to **include** racism?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2019-02-11T19:19:49.260+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=mlm olo mlm,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=XyruXXEm,comment-id=00050000000000000000,timestamp=2019-02-11T00:12:25.940+0000)\n>\n> Words don't have intrinsic meanings.\n\nCould you please explain, in detail, what you mean when you say \"words\"?\nOh, also \"don't\"?
