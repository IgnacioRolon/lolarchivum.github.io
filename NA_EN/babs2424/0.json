Temmo can basically remove an ADC like Lucian or Kog'maw from an entire team fight with one blind. I don't understand why the blind time is so long it should be shorter considering its a lock on ability and not a skill shot. The AP scalling on it is 80% making him able to half health you with one shot. Considering the base damage is 260.\n        Third his ability to poke in lane is so high i think his attack range should be lowered to 480 because 500 is just to high he can bully out laners like Riven and Jax.    The ability he has hes just two well rounded as a champion he has range he has poke he has dot effects its just all to much and it makes him two strong.\n      Lastly his E i think that it is a well rounded ability except for the AP scaling 70% off your AP lets say a Teemo has 1000 AP 1 auto attack will dead 1170 damage in 4 seconds (Not including the auto attack damage or any items like {{item:3151}} ).\n     For my conclusion i think Teemo is out of line and is two strong of a champion i mean a Teemo with 1000 AP will do 950 damage with 1 shroom, 870 damage with 1 auto attack, 1060 damage with 1 Q These damage ratios are To high and he need a proper nerf.{{champion:17}} Here is a video of a temmo Yes he gets feed but watch the first couple minutes and watch the damage (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7wYPhHJPJ0) All Credit goes to this guy for the video (YukalayleeGames)","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2014-12-26T18:14:48.450+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teemo's AP build already got a huge nerf...
