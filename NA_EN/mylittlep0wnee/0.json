The 1st amendment \"protects\" you from your government, but it doesn't \"protect\" you from a private company.\nWe play Riot's game, so we must abide by their rules.\n\n***\n> [{quoted}](name=mylittlep0wnee,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=hWp8QwbW,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-04-20T05:58:19.602+0000)\n>\n> Im pretty sure I was the only person from my team who reported him\n\nGreat! You only need one report - yours - to trigger the system.

In a nutshell, the IFS is like a collective brain of the community.\nIf the majority of the community agrees with you (meaning that behaviour is frown upon by most of us), then a punishment may happen.\n\nDon't forget we don't always receive notifications for when punishments are issued.
