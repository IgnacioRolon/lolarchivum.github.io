You would enable or disable this when you feel like it.  ***\r\n*** You  want to level mastery on champs that you haven&#039;t mastered  - enable it.   ***\r\n*** You want to play all your champs - disable the feature.  ***\r\nHence it will not impact your current game play in ARAM if you don&#039;t want it to. \r\n\r\n\r\nWould be great if you can add an option in ARAM  for players to enable or  disable champs with mastery 5 or higher from the ARAM selection. I don&#039;t SR, but it would be cool if i can get to play some of the champs I don&#039;t have high mastery on, without having to leave the ARAM queue .\r\n\r\n\r\nif you eventually get to a few  &lt;5 master champs,  this will severely limit the feature when enabled, giving you the advantage of playing the same few champs over and over, hence you can pad the small champ selection pool with mastery 5 champs.\r\nexample:  if you fall under 10 champs (arbitrary # , can be 15 or 20.. )  with mastery level 4 or less.. then throw in some random mastery 5 or higher champs to increase the random selection pool size to 10 champs.\r\n\r\nWhat do you all think ?","replies":[{"poster":"MrHaZeYo","date":"2019-01-14T07:12:42.807+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not random then.","replies":[{"poster":"mylittlep0wnee","date":"2019-01-14T07:18:17.194+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"lol getting the same champ 3 times in one night when it is not even on rotation is not random either. lol Its no different than having a smurf account, only different is that when you enable it, you are playing with champs you are NOT good with, where as a smurf account gives a person champs they are good with.
