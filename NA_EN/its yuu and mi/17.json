Let's have a discussion.\n\nI don't approve of stuff that would get you in severe trouble if your family or coworkers saw you looking at. Stuff like hentai and all of that, I get.\n\nThat being said, this is a Teen rated forum. This is a game with Champions who have sexual jokes (Janna specifically makes a prostitution joke. Nidalee talks about a wild side. Nidalee has a \"cougar\" passive. Kat's Christmas skin has a pole dance, so does Nid. Ahri is Ahri.) There is a certain territory that comes with this.\n\nYou should know, when you come on these forums, there's a certain risk. Someone might reference a poledance made by Kat, or something like that. There might be perfectly okay fanart of Ahri, that let's face it, will be considered \"sexy\". \n\nThis is not a forum meant for 5 year olds to discuss-- this is T for Teen. You know, when you come here, that minor sexual references will happen. You know that people will be talking about acts of violence. You know that people will be cussing, saying things like \"fuck\" and \"bitch\". These things may not be the safest for school or work, and you need to be aware of that and use your best judgment.\n\nSo when there's a \"who would you rather bang?\" thread, with two people who are perfectly clothed fine, that aren't revealing in the slightest, I have to say-- the 3rd party hired mods made a mistake. This should be acceptable. That's not worse than a prostition joke. That's not worse than a dance referencing strippers. That's not worse than a lot of things that exist in the video game, that this forum is based on.\n\nIf your work cannot handle a \"who would you rather bang?\" thread, then you should not view these forums altogether. If your teachers are not the lenient type, and lean more towards being strict, you should view these forums away from school computers, and use your phone or something like that, or wait to get home.\n\nThis is better than moderation removing content from everyone else, with perfectly acceptable sexual implications, that don't go over the top.\n\nI don't want anyone fired. I don't want anyone suspended.\n\nBut this isn't right.","replies":[]}
