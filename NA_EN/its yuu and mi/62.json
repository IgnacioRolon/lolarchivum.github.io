So they made URF, and even did their best to pseudo-balance it so as many picks as possible could be used, at least to a relative degree.\n\nAnd yet you guys still complain about the \"tryhards\".\n\nHere, let me explain things from my eyes, maybe try to shine a light on things:\n\n-I did play some of the OP  shit. I used Ziggs, Nidalee, and a couple of others for a few matches. Even got a Quadra as Ziggs in one match; woulda won if it wasn't a 4v5. \n-I also played AP Rek'Sai, made a bunch of tunnels, fed hard, lost.\n-I also played AD Rek'Sai, made a bunch of tunnels, fed hard, lost.\n-I also played AP Bruiser Shen. Did very very well, but still lost sadly.\n-I also laned against a Nidalee as AD Varus, suffered the rough lane, and got my ass carried.\n\nBut here's the thing. I used relatively weak picks, won and lost, used the op picks, and overall?\n\nI still had fun.\n\nI am absolutely astonished how people can say \"Oh my god, these tryhards pick stuff like LB and Swain every match and it's just not fun unless I pick the same shit.\"\n\n... -What-?\n\nI had fun losing, I had fun winning. I had fun not because I was guaranteed to win, or stand much of a chance, but because doing stupid shit in a temporary game mode is great. I had fun stomping some games with OP shit and I had fun getting my shit kicked in while I tried other things that didn't quite work. \n\n\"But they're tryhards\" well so what? Are you saying you have to win to have fun? They're using what they know works, what they know provides powerful, fun effects for them. If you want to try out a possibly weaker option, there's nothing wrong with that! I did too. But don't then complain because you got your shit kicked in, when you knew it was a valid chance.\n\nGod damn, you guys will complain about anything don't you? Riot makes alternate game modes, you complain. Riot makes URF balance changes, and URF, you still complain! How about just saying \"Thank you Riot\", and leaving it there? What's so hard about that?\n\nI've been visiting GD less in these past 24 hours because quite frankly, seeing the same bullshit over and over again about \"Oh my god, these tryhard picks, they went Hec again\" is nothing short of disgusting. -Of course- they're picking the powerful picks, because having power is fun.\n\nIf you want to win, pick them too. If you want to dick around and have fun, then maybe you should learn to have fun even when losing in a temporary game mode, that isn't costing you anything to lose. No LP losses or anything. Maybe less IP, but that's not really the point of URF.\n\nWho cares if you lose? If you didn't have fun, maybe you were looking at it in the wrong light. You know, I'm terrible at Vayne. Really, really bad. I decided to pick her, one to practice and two to have fun with all of the Tumbles. I went mid vs a Fizz. You know how hard that is? I got carried and did very little damage that game. I struggled the entire game.\n\nI still had fun though, because I got to mechanically enjoy what I wanted.\n\nYou. All of you. You need to stop throwing a tantrum, learn to say thank you, and learn to appreciate things\n\nYou guys have really disappointed me.","replies":[]}
