Honestly I'm pretty adept at the guy and I really just love the idea that someone's in danger, they think they're gone... You come in, save them, and without a word, just head back to your jungle. \n\n{{champion:102}} : Remember before her changes a couple seasons ago when everyone considered her a joke and unviable? I enjoyed her then and I enjoy her now.\n\n{{champion:113}} One of my best friends is Plat and may as well be Diamond-- and he has beaten Challengers numerous times, and he's convinced she's my best Champion and that I'm probably high Plat with her at the lowest. Honestly I'm just really good at her. \n\n{{champion:72}} : My first Champion ever played, I'm looking to get into seriously playing him more.\n\n{{champion:83}} : Stupidly niche Jungler but honestly I've proven I can beat Plats/some Diamonds with him, with only a little practice. I think with a bit more I could play him at a Diamond level. I probably won't use him much, but when the comp favors him it'll be nice. I'm still not entirely sure on this one but I'm leaning towards it.\n\nYeah, I know, \"dear diary\" and yada yada, no one cares, I'm just kinda happy that after a lot of testing in the new jungle I've narrowed down what I like. \n\nI also might start playing Shaco in Ranked at the end of the season; I need a lot more fine-tuning but I understand him pretty well. The biggest reason why I didn't play him before was I honestly hated all of his powerspikes from the different builds, but I actually like how Devourer works on him (I didn't like Flare funnily enough). \n\nSo I mean. No one probably cares but yay happy post.","replies":[]}
