Will pleasure Korea but if it&#039;s NA eyes aren&#039;t really batted.\r\n What I mean by that, is that Tank Akali-- or even Tank Katarina for that matter-- are hardly new. \r\n\r\nIf memory serves right, -Voyboy- was the original person who came up with it. Which is NA. At any rate, if my memory is incorrect and he didn&#039;t he&#039;s the one who popularized it to begin with.\r\n\r\nSure it&#039;s back now, in a new form, but it&#039;s not a new unheard of thing. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s seeing a larger usage and popularity spike because Korea did it. Which is disgusting honestly because people are so quick to praise a nation that isn&#039;t theirs instead of actually having faith in their own regions.\r\n\r\n## Second off, it proves that a lot more things are viable than previously believed and things will always be that way.\r\n\r\nA lot of people stick to the meta but some people like to theorycraft. A lot of people complain about the meta but they never look on how to change things. \r\n\r\nTank Akali didn&#039;t randomly get buffed out of nowhere. Titanic has been around, Grasp has been around, Akali&#039;s buffs weren&#039;t THAT big of a deal at least in my opinion. This build would have worked perfectly 100% fine at the beginning of the season.\r\n\r\nIt just took time for people to find it. \r\n\r\nThere&#039;s a lot of things like this. In the past there have been Veigar Jungle mains before his rework, in Diamond. There&#039;s a Master Tier AD Malzahar Jungle main right now and he&#039;s been Master for a while. There&#039;s a Diamond Azir Jungle main. There&#039;s a lot of weird shit out there. People are playing Zyra Jungle out there too, successfully. \r\n\r\nA lot of things are viable that aren&#039;t played much just due to popularity. As someone who&#039;s been an insanely good Galio player for more than one season and who&#039;s played hundreds and hundreds of Ranked games as him, I can actually tell you he&#039;s stronger now than he&#039;s ever been and why-- and I can explain him better than literally any other person on this entire forum (though he&#039;s still not top tier by any means). Look this thread isn&#039;t about me and I&#039;m not about to make it that way, but it&#039;s an anecdote to prove that look, some things that aren&#039;t popular can be made to work in the right hands. You can too. Hell didn&#039;t Chortle (who&#039;s a seriously good Zyra by the way) mention he himself was picking up Zyra Jungle?\r\n\r\nJust because it&#039;s unpopular doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s not viable. BUT. You have to have the proper logic and math to back it up. So I&#039;m sorry Mr. Bronze 4 AD Swain main, just because his E ramps up his damage dealt doesn&#039;t mean he can viably ADC. And, contrary to popular belief, Lizard Wizard Renekton is not actually a thing. \r\n\r\nBut there are some out there still. Go try AP Rengar. Go try AD Split Push LeBlanc with Static/Trinity/Tank top lane. Go try TF with Rapid Firecannon (it&#039;s really funny). \r\n\r\nThis whole Tank Akali thing just proves that some people who were super dedicated to prove that a Champion previously laughed at had potential could find a way too.\r\n\r\nI&#039;d imagine it took a long time to figure out Titanic/Grasp was actually a good way to go on her, and if it didn&#039;t then god damn good insight on that.\r\n\r\n## TL;DR: Have some pride in your own guys, and believe it or not, there are a lot of picks out there that are viable despite what people will tell you. Tank Akali proves just that, and out of all of this hype, _that_ is what interests me most.","replies":[]}
