Look at ANY post about it not made by staff posters. I don't think I have literally seen another that has been positive. Some have been neutral I think?\r\n\r\nA large, large majority of the player base flat out DOES NOT like this.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's unfair to say there is nothing to be gained from the hard work and effort put here.\r\n\r\nJust learn from the mistakes.\r\n\r\n-1. Learn from the mistakes on the forums. NO ONE, and I do mean -NO ONE-, likes the forum mods there. AT ALL. This account is actually banned on the forums, and you know why? I asked GD how their day was. Just like Xelnath, a Rioter. A forum mod closed the thread, and I later made a thread asking about it. That was closed. And I was permabanned. The forum mods commonly move threads to places they do not belong, they ban people who do not deserve it, and do not ban people who do. I have proof if it needs to be seen.\r\n\r\nI understand -some- of the logic. If there are flat out forum rules enforced, people can toy around with them, yada yada, disputes and such, I get it. I've heard why Rioters have unofficially said why there are no rules.\r\n\r\nNow let's look at other forums.\r\n\r\nSmogon, for Pokemon. Absolutely no trolls. Threads are serious business. Rules are posted, in place, enforced. However, there is less fun there, so I wouldn't encourage that model.\r\n\r\nWorld of Warcraft. People have harmless fun in the harmless fun sections, otherwise, they are serious. There are forum rules, and they are enforced. The mods are very clear about what is allowed. Don't say you don't follow this game, you hired Ghostcrawler, and several other designers from WoW.\r\n\r\nThere are others too.\r\n\r\nNow let's look here. People make troll threads, p0rn threads, etc. And some are caught immediately, some aren't. Meanwhile some make legitimate threads and get punished. The biggest issue is that the mods are not clear about it. They don't post why (\"You broke the Summoner's Code\"... Okay...), they don't say WHY a thread is closed or locked, and they don't say why someone is banned.\r\n\r\nJust. Own. Up to it. It is FLAWED.\r\n\r\n-2. Learn from the mistakes of the Beta.\r\n\r\nPeople mainly hate one thing here: The \"popularity rule\". The community as a whole has a very rational fear that popular posts will get the top, and everything else won't see the light of day. True or not, this is a very realistic fear. This needs to be addressed. You absolutely cannot fight this, because this is how we feel-- it doesn't matter how you feel, because quite frankly, you cater to us. And our feelings matter more, because we're the ones with the money, and we're the ones you make this game for. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm sorry if this comes off harsh,  but quite frankly it has to be.\r\n\r\nYour forum mods are TERRIBLE. But the rest of the forums are fine, except the no avatars/signatures, and the crashes that happen too much.\r\n\r\nAnd this Beta is too popularity-driven. On top of this, people also find it confusing, often enough. Make it easier to read, maybe make a section that's a welcome one, for new users.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd better yet, why don't you go back onto YOUR forums, and ask US what you can do better with the Beta. Don't listen to the \"delete it\" posts, but SERIOUSLY take in what we say. ASK. US. Not you. Us.\r\n\r\n(Post-statement, also, the Beta \"updates\" section is nice, something like this with notes in it could be nice for moderation, for the staff to notify a poster of why a thread was moved, deleted, closed, etc).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI understand  you do not like GD. Funny thing, most of GD has a love-hate relationship. But believe it or not, you can fix it.\r\n\r\nBut you need to quite this piece of sh** superiority complex, and actually listen to us.\r\n\r\nThis may sound demanding, but face it: Your customers aren't happy. Look at your posts about it. Downvoted to oblivion.\r\n\r\nThat says something.\r\n\r\nNow. Please. From someone who actually cares about the Forums, the direction the Beta is going, and Riot Games (no seriously, I do love you guys, you're just going the wrong direction here), please get back on those \"toxic\" forums, and talk with us.\r\n\r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"AnonTwo","date":"2014-02-18T04:58:46.228+0000","up_votes":216,"down_votes":20,"body":"Personally, i feel if the community feels this way, they should prove it in number.\n\nGiven the nature of \"Reddit\" all the community has to do is this:\n\nLog in one time, open this thread, and upvote it.\n\nIf it works as they say it does, this thread should overtake the first slot on the forums.\n\nThat's all i'm saying.\n\nWithout outside forces, this thread should be able to beat out every other thread here.","replies":[{"poster":"the HadMatter15","date":"2014-02-18T07:22:09.453+0000","up_votes":75,"down_votes":6,"body":"looky looky its at the top.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FaerKhan","date":"2014-02-18T18:13:50.691+0000","up_votes":51,"down_votes":5,"body":"This makes the 3rd \"the community beta is bad\" post that tops the site...

Riot may be looking to Reddit as a model for their beta, but they don't seem to understand why Reddit is less toxic (on the surface) than GD:\n\nReddit has clear, visible rules, clear, visible mods, and clear, visible punishments for breaking those rules, alongside reasoning as to why a punishment was dealt.\n\nThis can all be fixed, without formatting a new community outlet, by simply getting some mods who do their damned job correctly, and have presence in the community. If a thread is moved, they should post in it, explaining why. If a thread is closed, there should be a post and an explanation. If a poster is banned, there should be a valid reason on the ban screen, that's not \"you ave violated the Summoner's Code\". These are all basic things that almost every web forum has. GD is a large community, and it is a daunting task, but it's definitely doable with a small, dedicated team of moderators.\n\nRight now, moderation seems random, if not completely absent. Threads get closed at random, regardless of whether or not they deserved it, along with thread movements and bans. It honestly feels like there are bots or scripts set up that just automatically dole out a response, with no human element whatsoever.\n\nI think Riot is being too hasty with this Community Beta. They don't need to make a new platform for discussion; they just need to take care of and maintain the one they have.\n\nI'm going to try, though. I'm going to give Riot the data they need, and I'm going to use the Community Beta, and give it a chance for a week. Afterward, I'll compile what I like and dislike about it, and make a thread on both platforms about it, to gather as much attention as I can about what can be fixed on both platforms.\n\nHere's an Olaf for reading this damned far down my crazy-ass rant. {{champion:2}}","replies":[{"poster":"Jethzk","date":"2014-02-18T11:03:04.316+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":2,"body":"Honestly I thought general discussion didn't have forum moderators.  I read a lot of different forums, and it is by far the worst when it comes to forum moderation.  There's 1 simple tool that is lacking from GD and it's the report button.\n\nEvery post I've read promoting the community beta forum is that it's less toxic. Please understand **Popularity does not = moderation.** \n\nIt seems like the goal of this forum is to see how the fans feel and what is popular.  The general consensus seems to be, if it's popular, it's the right thing to do.  This is actually a very simplistic view that does not work.\n\nLet's look at government.  Democracy is a great way to live, we get to make our own choices!  However the majority of people aren't smart enough to understand the full implications of what they want and how it effects everything else.  The senate was created to allow higher educated people to vote for the general masses.  Yes, they want to educate people and have them make smart decision, but ultimately they may choose to vote against the popular decision.  There have been presidents elected in the past who received a majority vote from the senate but did not receive a majority vote from the population.\n\nWithout the higher education filtering, we may end up in a world with no tax on gasoline.  Heck, gas is way too expensive, reducing the cost would be a good thing!  This in turn would result in poor road conditions and would farther impact the economy.  My point is, the popular belief isn't always the best system.  If all you do is look at the popular opinion, you may miss many well articulated reasons to do things different that would lead to better results.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pajamasalad","date":"2014-02-18T05:51:24.585+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'll try to join you for this week of leddit fun then, ManDude.

Moderation practices are undergoing improvements, particularly with the full feedback loop (getting players messaging as to why an action was taken, and making sure that each action that's taken has an easy to verify reason for the action).\n\nI'm also really happy this thread got so much traction. As one of the developers on this platform, I couldn't agree more with the sentiment that what you see now is inadequate for a viable community replacement. Sound strange? Keep reading.\n\nWhat makes me super happy is the fact that this highly relevant thread from our passionate players dominated the \"Hot\" sorting strategy. It is a small proof of concept for raising visibility on important topics that mean a lot to our players. The reality is that this thread would continue to need to get bumped in order for visibility to be raised and maintained if this kind of attention was desired within vBulletin, and even then, there's probability introduced that other threads \n\nSomething kinda interesting here is that I agree with most opinions expressed (hard to get traction as a latecomer, large threads with lots of comments can get hairy to consume, circlejerk, etc). We knew when we opened this up early on that these problems would exist. We also knew that we didn't want to solve these problems without hearing what our players had to say about them first. We're ready to start making larger shifts to make this platform unique and easily usable, and it must be done off of constructive criticisms and suggestions that are provided.\n\nI also believe that we have a great opportunity within this platform to conquer those challenges. This platform is **much** more than this current website you see and interact with, and has an extraordinary amount of flexibility.  Aside from the comments on news articles, and the various community contests that have been ran on this platform, it's capable of providing both a \"reddit\" experience and a typical bulletin board experience. At this point, we're looking for the right balance and blend because neither are perfect, but both have qualities that we all value. \n\nOn a side note, something that's coming next week is the option to easily toggle between traditional \"flat\" comments and the nested tree.

Upvoting/Downvoting. The concept of post visibility being determined by popularity is a flawed one. Someone who takes the time to write a well though out, but controversial/dissenting, opinion deserves the same visibility that a popular opinion does. Under this system, off topic and irrelevant posts, as well as \"bait\" gets shoved to the bottom, but posts that mindlessly echo the popular sentiment get shoved to the top. Neither of these types of posts have anything to add to the discussion, but one gets more visibility than a well thought out opinion, which is just wrong.\n\n2. Nested discussions are a pain to navigate. They work really well for carrying on multiple 1 on 1 conversations, but fall short of the mark for trying trying to locate new information relevant to the topic at hand. Krylhos is assuring us that you are working on some fixes for this, and to this I say please and thank you.\n\n3. Lack of moderation is a pain on GD, but will kill the Community Beta. Poorly made topics and known forum trolls are a nuisance, but you can bump a good topic and ignore poor posts in your threads.

With comments, however, I feel like there aren't enough tools to parse through content and sort it in ways that make conversations more accessible.\n\nThe most efficient way to find this particular response is to switch to chronological view and page to the end, but doing so removes all context from the conversation.  It's easy, because you can very quickly navigate to the content, but you lose the visual background that Discussion View gives. \n\nFinding it in Discussion View is far more difficult in regards to finding the content, but once you find it there is better context.  Here are the two main reasons I see for it being more laborious:\n\n* It takes an extremely long time for the platform to autoscroll to KillerStriker's comment\n* It's inefficient to minimize branches within the thread while still finding the relevant content\n\nIn long threads (450 responses, for example), finding the conversations that resonate with what you're looking for is pretty hard to do efficiently.  I proposed [a mechanism to help with this](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/site-feedback/gxJE2ArU-proposal-comment-view-settings-lets-make-giant-threads-easier-to-follow) a while back that didn't receive traction, but I'd definitely be interested as to your opinion on it.","replies":[{"poster":"Jamnon","date":"2015-04-14T00:00:38.478+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"This system of theirs assumes a few things:\n\n- That everyone on the forums is active much of the time and is therefore able to see topics of interest.\n- That voting will be used and not abused.
