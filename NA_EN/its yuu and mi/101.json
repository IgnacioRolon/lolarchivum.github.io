He was an okay jungler last season so I'm hoping he'll be an okay jungler this season.\n\nIf this game goes well or if I can justify the merits of it from this game, I'll attempt to hit Diamond with it this season, as I love Galio.\n\n4/26 Masteries (CDR/Double Edged Sword/Expose Weakness in Offense) and AD Reds/Armor Yellows/Scaling CDR Blues (5%)/MR Blues/AP Quints is the setup I'm currently using in testing. Although I run Defensive in Masteries, I go AP Bruiser in most of my builds, though occasionally I go full tank. Full AP is rare but happens-- granted last season I mained him mid lane and supp (I think top Galio is trash except for a few matchups, and Jungle Galio was okay last season, we'll see this season).\n\nEdit:\n\nhttp://i.gyazo.com/3f023eeeb08d57fa900b3559fa3548fe.png\n\nhttp://i.gyazo.com/b7bc54119e80c7f5be71f9c63e5b5df7.png\n\nEdit: I say \"Only get 10% CDR More\" but leave FH and Morellonomicon in there as stupidly niche buys \n\n> Jungle Galio?\n> \n> His W procs off jungle monsters doesn't it..\n> \n> Though He'd probably be really bad in duels and have poor clear speed. His ganks (except for lane ganks) would be pretty subpar unless you manage to land a strong slow with your Q. He would have good mobility and decent escape in his jungle, he just couldn't fight off an invader.\n\nYou play him strictly for his utility. Doesn't matter if you play him Mid, Support, or Jungle, that's what you pick him for. He -can- function as a burst or poke mage, as a bruiser, or as a tank. All of those variants still are played because of his utility, and that really doesn't go away no matter where you play him.\n\nHis clears are on the slow side, but not to the point it's unplayable (they beat Jungle Shen's and he's a viable jungler)","replies":[]}
