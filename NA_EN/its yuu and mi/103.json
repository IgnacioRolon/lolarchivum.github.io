He loved the Champion everyone considered shit.\r\n\r\nI hadn't checked up on him since the rework. I tried lolkinging him but a level 1 profile came up.\r\n\r\nI found his Facebook. Last post about his stream was October 2014.\r\n\r\nI found his \"new\" profile on Lolking. No recorded matches, though it's clearly him. He hasn't played in a very long time. \r\n\r\nA player made his dream by hitting Challenger on a Champion everyone viewed as bad, but he enjoyed it and he made it. Then with the rework... He didn't adapt.\r\n\r\nHe just left.\r\n\r\nI... I feel sad for the guy. I hope he'll come back some day...","replies":[]}
