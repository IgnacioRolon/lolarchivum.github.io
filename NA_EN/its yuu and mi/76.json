But I mean you see champs like Shaco often forsaking Warrior altogether and Cinderhulk is sometimes better to be delayed. Hell I was Jungling Karthus recently and I went Tear-&gt;other shit and skipped Echoes entirely. \n\nI dunno, I just think it&#039;s interesting that quite a few Champs can get away with/actually can prefer not rushing a Jungle item but maybe that&#039;s just me. Shit like Shyv and Diana and such I&#039;d still go their items respectively I guess.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Mounting Dread,realm=NA,application-id=mNBeEEkI,discussion-id=3N3UuhwQ,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-08-25T00:10:00.886+0000)\n>\n> Oh yeah  I forgot Fiddles somehow.\n","replies":[]}
