It's, \"You realized what happened, if you make another mistake you're out.\"\n\nSecond, the picture according to them wasn't safe, however the community views it otherwise, and it was left up to be discussed, meaning while that's questionable, that wasn't the full reason why I was banned-- nor, surprisingly, other pictures that I -accidentally- went too far with months ago (censoring them). It came from something I think others should take note of too-- I made the mistake and fucked up by being a bit too provocative in some of my jokes on GD. \n\nSomething I guess I didn't take account of, and I'm posting this because I know I'm not the only one out there, was that I posted too many jokes that weren't safe to read. And if these are repeated, they'll be noticed.\n\nSo to clarify a few things, Riot didn't \"play favorites\" or anything, and the picture was left up to be discussed. Also, the other threads were removed so that things could be focused for discussion for the community. Besides that, it's important to note that sometimes we need to take a step back and re-evaluate what we're saying and to what audiences they may go to. \n\nI try to do this often but we all slip up, and I guess this is a good reminder that we should be a bit more careful, because I know I'm not the only one here and I think we as a community can be a bit more careful.\n\nThat being said, I do apologize for any times I stepped out of bounds, and I'll be making sure that i won't do that again. When i was banned, I broke down into tears because honestly? I like you guys. I like speaking with you guys. I might be a cynical ass here and there, and I might be rather blunt in speaking my thoughts to some of you guys, but at the end of the day, I love all of you except the malicious trolls (you know damn well who you are).\n\nI'm glad to be back with you GD. Hope you're all having a wonderful day.","replies":[]}
