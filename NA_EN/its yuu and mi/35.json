At what point are we agreeing having 1 person get solo xp, while another person gets solo camps, verses 2 people that get less xp, is good?\n\nthere are also absolutely some champions that can solo the lanes and their entire lane is more their presence than anyone else that could join them too. I can pretty much solo 1v2 lane with zed his range and safety is so high.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-07-01T00:29:59.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But spamming challenging smite in lane is ok.","replies":[]}]}
