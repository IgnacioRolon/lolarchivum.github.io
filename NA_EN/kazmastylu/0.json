Potentially unfair permanent ban.","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":"Kazamastylu here, After playing a series of games the day before yesterday I was banned for third party programs. That would be completely fine and dandy if I had anything of the sort. My computer can&#039;t even run league in a playable way with anything other than Skype open in the background. Friends are saying third party programs usually means scripts and it was from the instant feedback system which is automated. I&#039;ve never had any history with scripting or anything like that before and in those games I played I didn&#039;t even do very well in fact I think I got carried hard one of them, which wouldn&#039;t be possible if I was scripting or using some hack. I&#039;d like to have some rioter look at my account because I think I was lied on by one of the enemy teams and that&#039;s what triggered the ban. Ive already submitted a support ticket, and got no reply so I&#039;m going to try here as well. If someone could help me out that&#039;d be really nice, as I really love this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-09-18T19:25:26.289+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It can take a few days for them to get to your ticket depending on the backlog, so please be patient. Do not bump it unless adding necessary info, because it pushes the ticket to the back of the queue and delays a response.\n\nRiot does not punish people based on the claims of other players. If someone lied in a report/ticket against you it would've been investigated fully before coming to a decision on that. If you were punished for cheating and you are certain you have never used any automated programs, scripts, hacks, etc. that interacts with League including tampering with game files for things like just changing the field-of-view or aspect ratio, there is always a possibility you were unaware of the presence of such on the computer/client you used or someone else could have accessed your account and used them. In cases of account compromise, the account user is responsible for maintaining a reasonable level of security and may be liable for what someone else did on it if they did not keep their information secure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-18T19:24:18.496+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does not matter what anyone else said about you, the automatic system only goes by detectable proof.\n\nChances are some program running on your system is aggressively modifying or hooking LoL.

I legit only used to play in internet cafes (didn't have internet at home), where they don't even allow you to install anything. I tried appealing it, but within four hours, Riot sent me a suspiciously automated-looking email saying they've manually reviewed my account and that I was definitely using third-party programs. Then they stopped replying to my outraged emails. I have since moved on, far surpassed my previous rank, and have long since accepted that I simply got screwed over that one time.","replies":[{"poster":"Tinlegs","date":"2016-09-20T00:50:40.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well in my case the account I have / had was an open beta account so it has been around for a long time.

To say the least I have alot of friends I met through LOL and my only contact is via LOL so if I loose this account I would also loose contact with them.  \nNormally I wouldn't put this much effort into getting an account back and just play something else however with the friends and time spent in LOL I want to atleast try and keep it, especially when I know I haven't done anything wrong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kazmastylu","date":"2016-09-19T18:19:08.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah hopefully nothing like that happens again","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tinlegs","date":"2016-09-19T10:59:07.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like yourself Kazmastylu I have been incorrectly identified as scripting account and received a permanent ban.
