If they confirm it, people get excited.\nIf due to complications it cannot be implemented people will go insane. \nIt occured when they were looking into Zed's nerfs 2 - 3 patches ago on his Q and Ult/R. They released information on his Ult being nerfed and then it was reverted, the boards went insane.\nTbh it was warranted considering the Rioter behind the QSS nerf post was a massive dick too a lot of people, but regardless the sentiment is there that confirming changes to champions before they are being iterated is never a good thing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2016-06-29T02:31:39.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please don't nerf Karma.
