More then likely your going to see her snowball spam her Q and wave clear with ease, use that mobility to gap close you enough to E grab you and then beat the crap out of you to where your zoned, turret hugging or pretty much dead if she manages to get another E off of you or make use of that mobility to get close enough for a hard to escape Q, especially if you do not have boots to mitigate the mobility gap, when her tentacles made from her passive and her Q which also gains that slam damage bonus, can already turn into enough of a bother.\n\nIf Deadman's plate was removed from the game, i would not be amazed if we see a sharp decrease in tank or tank/fighter champion mixes viability without that +60 move speed bonus which trumps so many other mobility items and grants 'sustainability' against AD champions and plenty of hp to soak hits with much more ease. Sadly we can't get that case yet, but at the very least the bonus move might as well be capped to +30 to make it more in line with other mobility items or make it where the mobility can't be constantly sustained especially when you aren't auto attacking anything for the majority of the time, probably creating more measures then just roots and slows to make stacks decline (such as maybe needing to be in combat for the stacks to build to also reduce its ability to roam around fast and get back to your outter'most turret as if you were TPing to it).","replies":[]}]}]}
