He can even give proof of voice confirmation because people on the Vg team speak recognized his voice. A guy told him about VG over league. Shortly after literally the next day he logged on and couldn't log onto his account. We both think the guy who told him about Vg stole his account, because they got into a little argument over skype and the guy wanted to account share or something... When my brother told him no the guy was like \"I am gonna Hack you or whatever....\" He told support about it and complained to me about it. I tell him give it 2 days before we make a post about it to give riot some time to sort through the proof. It has been about 5 days now which is strange when the proof is sitting right infront of riot. He gave them all the proof he could think of. Master Card, 5 Friends, He told his first champs he had to answer first champ he ever played too if you can believe it.... After all these questions they don't give his account back and they are literally just taking their time i don't understand. I mean it's pretty obvious who's account it is already. I have seen this kind of neglect from riots support myself first hand when i remember months back i got banned for being boosted. I literally had not done anything wrong. Apparently a friend of mine had logged onto my account \"Without my knowledge\" and had done like just a few ranked games and i got all my rewards taken away... Riot did not give 2 shits about a thing i had to say even though i played this game fairly for 3 years since season2. I felt robbed of the hardwork i had put into the game. This game became a daily part of my life and to take away all that i had worked for all this time i hit rock bottom. They thought they were punishing me for being boosted but they would not take mercy or even hear me out. During this time i stressed my innocence on  forums. I got more people wishing me doom and hate comments then anything but the attention eventually lead to riot giving a fuck about my account and they messaged me back to say i was screwed lol. Lets just say my rank went from High Plat Elo almost diamond to Gold because why play ranked when you won't get any rewards lol... Well so there ya have it. I hope to get a riot started here maybe some people will be outraged by league not giving my bro his account back. But more then likely people will say \"he is Guilty Burn him at the Stake\" Either is fine say your opinions here. The more attention this gets the more likely riot will pay a visit :D His account was ThePrinceOfPigs and he was just a Bronze player but he had his account for about 2 years now he just didn't have much time to play LOL. Regardless what is his is his and it's riots game which makes nothing entitled to my brother but unless they ban people for no reason idk why they wouldn't give his account back. He had spent a lot of money for skins and champs and other things and was due for a Tournament Ryze Skin and some Rp for winning the TOURNAMENT :D Ty for the read guys, hope this can get fixed soon. But ya know how the riot support can be....","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-11-05T02:49:33.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Hobo Strangler!\n\nYour a good friend for wanting to increase visibility regarding your friends account issues!
