My internet was still up and i had a stream still running in the background so this was really weird, i also had no firewalls active. I never reconnected so i had to manually leave the game to reconnect myself because the game could not recognize the connection i was on for some reason. this was not the main issue however. When i did reconnect everything was normal until my game randomly went into slow motion. Everything moved half as fast and then teleported to catch up to where they actually were every second or so. This made the game completely unplayable. I attempting manually disconnecting and reconnecting but after about 30 seconds of normal speed everything would go slow mo. This was not only the character movement even the cast times on abilities was slower and the speed of the music and speed of the announcer's voice. I have been playing for 4 years and have never seen or heard of this and i was wondering what might have caused it.
