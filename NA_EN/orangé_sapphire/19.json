I saved up a decent amount of money and it has always been my dream to drive a super fancy car. Does any one know any nice cars for under 61,000 dollars. I do not want to take any loans so please account for the taxes and other fees that may come along with the car as well as the insurance bump for the next 1 year.\r\nThanks!","replies":[]}
