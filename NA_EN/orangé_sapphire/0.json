This can all be prevented if people go slower but people don&#039;t care until they get into a accident. I say, Lets reduce all speed limits \r\n\r\nNew Speed Limits\r\n\r\nInterstate - 55 Miles Per hour\r\nLocal High Way - 45 Miles Per Hour\r\nSchools, near parks, neighborhoods, parking lots or near office buildings - 7 Miles per hour\r\nAny where else 30 Miles Per Hour\r\n\r\nAny one who breaks this law (Speeds more than 5 miles over)gets 3 days  in prison.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[]}
