There was a lady in front of me with a kid. She was buying her kid a hotdog. You could see that the kid was really hungry and he even said it like 3 times. She was holding the hotdog cause she did not want him to start eating it until they left the store. She gets to the register and asks for some Newport 100s which is like 6 something here and hands the cashier 7 bucks, and hands the cashier a foods stamps card for the hotdog. The cashier say&#039;s we can&#039;t sell hot food on a food stamsps card. The lady then says, thats fine, I will just get the newports and hands the hotdog to the cashier. The kid then starts crying cause he was hungry. I felt super bad for him and handed him a bag of chips that I bought.  \r\n\r\nYour thoughts","replies":[]}
