He&#039;d be wearing summertime clothes, with a straw hat, flower shirt and cargo shorts. And the best part? Souls at replaced with little butterflies that he can go around and catches.\n\nWhat&#039;s not to love?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-05T17:25:18.259+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do like Koggles, he's adorable. :3 \n\nI looooove this idea!

Would be really neat if there were special interactions if Butterfly Catcher Thresh caught Monarch Kog'Maw in his neat, maybe a quote or special animation. I'm glad you like the idea tho.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-05-05T17:52:03.780+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I really like the idea.
