For the cheaper ones, it would be just a minor color change, but of course for the pricier ones it'd obviously be a whole new effect.\n\nAnd looking at that financially, I'd assume that would actually increase skin sales, as it makes lower-tier skins more enticing to be bought without decreasing the sales of higher tier skins. Some (but not all) people aren't always willing to buy the higher tier skins but would rather buy the lower tier skins, and simultaneously keeping top tier skins steady in sales (me included!) as people willing to buy the big time skins will still buy them. Because who doesn't like to show off some bizazz?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-20T22:59:20.385+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hi! \n\n> By that I mean do you ever add any additional things to a skin that would make the skin better looking, almost like a rework to a champion's abilities?\n\nThis actually isn't something that skins team would handle, but rather champion update.

If you're speaking in terms of Malzahar, the skins align with what they had previously. With updates, if skins used the base particles prior, they would likely use the base particles after the update. \n\nWould you mind giving me an example of the quality being reduced on a skin?\n\n> If you have decent kiting with malz that spellshield is basically always up completely invalidating the point of buying any skin that isn't snow day malz which is only available basically during the xmas season.\n\nThe spellshield detail was added because he was a 975 RP skin, so the team felt it was something that should be changed as well. \n\n> I would have assumed it was an oversight which happens\n\nYou're correct, this does happen. In fact, it happened with Jade Fang Cassiopeia, where the team didn't realize she had unique VFX. They're in the process of correcting that and giving her VFX that align better with the unique VFX she had before.","replies":[{"poster":"Shadow Hazard","date":"2016-05-23T17:50:19.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply. Honestly amazed you have been keeping up with so many of them over the past few days in general for responding.\nThe specific point about the malz skin I feel has its quality reduced is the fact that I said before if the spell shield spends most of its time up then you are basically playing with classic malz. I know that the argument can be made that snow day got a full new set up of colors for for his skills and therefore the passive, and shadow prince not having it for the skills wasn't an issue really but having the skin blocked of for a significant portion of the game for shadow prince is honestly disappointing to the point that the skin no longer feels it has it previous uniqueness.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-26T17:17:26.782+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> Thanks for the reply.
