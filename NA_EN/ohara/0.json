I hear the sound of champions spawning and it just crashes. So I exited League ASAP to reopen the client. the client then tells me somethings wrong and to reopen the League of Legends client. I do so, only to come across a notice that they reverted me to a previous patch. Now that i`m able to log in I get a notice that I`ve been hunted down by the Leaverbuster. I`m wondering if there were any other cases of this happening or was it just me? Kind of sucks because i haven't left a game in forever and now because of this B.S i am required to wait 20 minutes in queue.
