Rageblade Yi is already like the strongest DPS in the game, the problem is mostly his susceptibility to CC and lack of tankiness. With the removal of scaling armor and scaling magic resist, which are very common choices on Yi, his lategame takes a huge hit. It's quite annoying as you really want the ultimate hat + transcendance because the nerfs to R CD some years ago are still hurting him, but at the same time his base defensive stats are absolutely pathetic. His armor at lvl 18 is already smaller than a bunch of ADC's; it doesn't really make sense especially since some similar champions like Yasuo have higher values of armor.\n\nSo you feel kinda forced to go secondary resolve and get conditioning to get slightly tankier, but it's so much weaker than scaling runes (and the % bonus is the same of what you got with legendary guardian anyway)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Håppy","date":"2017-11-07T20:55:18.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Press the Attack isn't as good as people are hyping it up to be - It's no longer Fervor of Battle related, it's like..
