What other colors would you bundle in the pack?\n\nI would probably be interested in seeing a version of Green perhaps, either Dark Green or regular green.\n\nAs mentioned by Keagn, I also think that Cyan would be a good color, or possibly a darker shade of it.\n\nTo me, Mecha Kha'Zix seem to fit in colors that fit with Neon-light.

The purple is a cool idea o_o!  What other colors would you bundle in the pack?\n\nThis might not be intended for me, but I think a sea green and cyan color variation would be cool too. Maybe a bronze shell color, but when he evolves his R his shell becomes a goldish tint. Could maybe vaguely reference MK by making one gold with green light colors, and one rust-red with blue light colors. But from what I understand, changing the color of his glowing elements (like his claws specifically) may prove problematic when it comes to the particles and whatnot.","replies":[{"poster":"Supreme Frog","date":"2015-08-12T06:03:30.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would Riot make this for us ? {{champion:121}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Supreme Frog","date":"2015-04-11T02:15:47.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea i also think that purple is cool","replies":[]},{"poster":"Supreme Frog","date":"2015-04-11T02:13:29.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what other colors ?
