She has 2 damage outputs the auto attacks and the feathers it allows her to burst as-well as do consistent dmg. The feathers are so easy to land it's like a lux E complex where dodging is just a matter of lux missing rather than you escaping the dmg. Caitlyn will basically miss 3 auto's during xayahs ult phase, she can dodge ashe's arrow and varus ult. Basically any adc bot that rely's on landing skills to do dmg will be at a disadvantage fighting her. Xayah's main issue is that She does a lot of damage while being relatively safe! she is not broken OP but she is at a level were she makes her own meta because of iFrames. In terms of ADC carry she is the best choice atm especially when tanks are being reworked towards CC she can dodge them and mage burst dmg. A champion that sets a meta is not healthy for the game. Assassin's were already at an iffy spot atm she makes them worse, you either play kha zix or rengar now or nothing. As for mid is going to have to be Hard clickable CC so champs like lissandra. Also unlike other ADC's that some of their skill damage is converted to AP to reduce the damage all of her kit scales with AD at no toll.","replies":[{"poster":"Zerenza","date":"2017-04-22T14:00:27.269+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think your overeacting, she doesn't do that much damage, it's not hard to dodge infact her Q's and feather's have a very small hit box, moving in the correct angel(usually dodging down the map) you should dodge all of them unless she corrected for it and predicted it. Her laning phase is NOT safe either, she's extremely immobile and despite being able to dodge things she's so slow that if someone doesn't peel for her she might as well stand still cause no way she's surviving any other ADC that can chase her down, maybe Lucian, vayne, caitlynn, ezreal? She's a defensive ADC, it's only natural she'd win against adc's that can't match her push power and can't chase her down properly. In a solo lane she'll lose against anyone with CC pre-six, past six the mage will most likely do more damage than her because mages scale better mid game and get better powerspikes than her with their first item. \n\nYou should learn to play against her, she's only been out for a couple days.","replies":[{"poster":"RainbowIcee","date":"2017-04-22T14:18:12.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Lucian will miss his entire kit just by her pressing R and then she'll have him in her hands, caitlying will miss a lot of auto's because of her ult, vayne should have the advantage vs her and ezreal has an advantage and disadvantage vs all other adc's.

Blind Pick has never solved this problem. You'll [they'll] still have to worry about the other 4 players possibly picking/auto-locking the Champion(s) you [they] want to play. \n\nI don't even mind the fact that new champions get banned. What I mind is that new champions get banned IN NORMAL GAMES. See, Ranked games, I can understand banning them. Not because the new champion(s) may or may not be broken/op/etc, but simply because it's better to avoid having people attempting to 'first time' the new champion(s) in an environment where everyone is doing their best to win. Having someone 'first time' a Champion in Ranked automatically puts a burden on the team they're on.\n\nHowever, in NORMAL GAMES, sure people still want to win, but it's not as serious an environment as Ranked games. More often than not, people are playing Normals to learn/practice/improve on their Champion(s) for use in Ranked play. The problem with that, though, is that if said people want to try learning the new champions, said champion either gets banned (by the opposing team; or even their OWN TEAM) OR someone on the opposing team gets it first.\n\nIt's almost impossible to learn about how to use a new champion(s), let alone, learn how to fight against it [them], if everyone is banning it [them]. This is where my concern comes in.\n\nBlind Pick could potentially be a fix to this, if they just added role choices to it. Like, make people queue into it the same way they would Normal Draft, by letting them choose 2 roles. Only difference would be that once they got into champion select, there'd still be no ban phase, and you just pick whatever champion you feel like playing. That way, no one would have to worry about auto-lock, (as much), because you'd have to select a champion based on the role you queued for. (Unless you're one of those people who choose whatever you want, but it's still Blind Pick, so that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing.)","replies":[{"poster":"Aazzlano","date":"2017-04-22T00:03:21.868+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Here is something you need to realize -- Normals is not PBE. Many people play normals just to have fun, not to test a new champion. Maybe they don't want to play vs that champ. Maybe they have faced it x many times and are tired of it. Maybe they are broken. Maybe they main someone who that champion counters. They shouldn't need to stop playing the game or reduce their fun if they don't want to play with a certain champion open (which is one of the points of playing draft).\n\nMany players aren't playing to practice for Ranked, and don't care (and shouldn't need to) about you using Normal games as a tool to prepare for Ranked. You are playing to improve. They are playing for fun. Why should they have to cater to you? They are a member of the team just as much as you are. \n\nBlind pick is used by most people for testing new champions for a reason. You can't seriously expect to get the new champion every game you load into in Draft. Theres 6 bans, and up to 9 people higher pick priority than you, and any of the 5 of the enemy team could be the same role as you and take the champ.
