Because I&#039;ve had bloody well enough of losing ranked games for literally no reason.\n\nI probably won&#039;t even check back on this. It&#039;ll probably be deleted because people are sensitive and also afraid of the truth. Enjoy. Or don&#039;t, I don&#039;t really care.\n\n> http://www.lolskill.net/summoner/NA/Gloomeh/matches\n> \n> This player was just in my ranked game. He has JUST finished prelims and was placed in Silver 5 WITH ONLY 3 F###ING WINS. I won 8/10 prelims and was placed in F###ING BRONZE 2. This guy has NO F###ING CLUE what he&#039;s doing and utterly ruined my game. He was VERY nice and we are BOTH pissed as hell that your matchmaking system is doing this. He gets stomped and yelled at because you placed him WAY f###ing higher than his skill level, meanwhile I have to f###ing claw my way out of shit mountain. 3/10 = Silver 5, 8/10 = Bronze 2. F###. YOU. There&#039;s also a BRONZE player in my Silver 3 game. AND WHY THE F### DO I EVEN LOSE LP FOR THIS SHIT?!\n> \n> F###ING DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. COMPENSATE ME WHILE YOU F###ING FIGURE YOUR SHIT OUT SINCE I&#039;M HAVING A GODDAMN ANEURYSM PUTTING UP WITH YOUR GARBAGE.\n> \n> F###!!!!\n\nYes, I like to swear. Fun fact: people who swear are statistically more honest and genuine than those who don&#039;t.","replies":[]}
