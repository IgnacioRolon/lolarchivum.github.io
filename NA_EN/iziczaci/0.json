It does good things for your mmr, so you can go from losing roughly the same as you gain to gaining twice as much as you lose for wins and losses.\n\nFull on division jumps (as in skipping promo series) are really hard and you need to be basically a full tier mmr above, but I think you just mean you're having issues getting to/through promos (although I can't imagine what sort of MMR you have such that 8 wins isn't enough to earn 100 LP).\n\nIf you just mean you had 8 wins and then flubbed the promo series, then don't worry, the promo-helper system is a thing now. The next time you make it to the promo series, you'll get a free win, so you only need to win 1 of the next 2 games in the division promo series, so climbing is easy mode now (up to gold 1 anyway). This assume you don't dodge any games during promos, as that voids the free win, on top of the fact as it counts as a loss anyway so probably defeats the purpose.","replies":[{"poster":"IZicZacI","date":"2016-02-27T05:31:33.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your deep explanation!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Best Valor NA","date":"2016-02-27T05:14:54.609+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, you just gotta keep playing. imagine when you get to diamond and the LP Gains are much lower :b","replies":[]}]}
