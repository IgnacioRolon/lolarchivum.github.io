However, I don't understand the language so I don't know what they're trying to tell me when my login fails. And I know the username and password is correct. How do I change the language? Or could someone translate for me? Thanks. I'll send a picture if you can translate Japanese.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-27T15:48:28.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Our Japanese support team should be able to help with this.
