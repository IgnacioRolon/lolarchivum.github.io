His face looks absolutely terrible. I&#039;m not sure if the intent was to make him look like he was trying to be intimidating or &quot;sexy,&quot; but it comes across as an Internet meme instead of whatever the original intent was.\nThe eyes look awkward, small, and you can barely see his irises. His lips also look awkward and strange, and the emphasis seems to be on his larger lower lip, where his other splashes seem to show that his upper lip is the larger one. The smile(?) he has looks creepy, and would even give Thresh the willies. So please, send this back to the drawing board and work on it. It&#039;s current iteration is just awful.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Ve1vet","date":"2017-01-04T17:49:01.194+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, we've passed along the feedback for his face.

Lucian's face in his other splashes emphasizes his upper lip's size, and it doesn't look like he has a horrible underbite like he does in this one. His eyes are also spread out really weirdly here, unlike his facial structure in his other skins. In Lucian's other skins, he does have a larger nose; this one has that, but unlike the other skins, the bridge is massive and wide, and it spreads his eyes apart, which is not visible in his classic splash.\n\nAs for the aesthetic of the face, his expression is just a mess. His eyebrows are doing some crazy shit, and it conflicts anatomically with how his face is operating. His eyes are weird and squinted, almost closed, and arching your eyebrow like he's doing makes it almost impossible and really strange looking to squint. His mouth is just horrendous, in this redneck smile that can only be achieved by shoving your jaw out and causing an underbite, and again, looks awkward if you actually try to achieve this look with a human face. This is just a mess, just like Man-Face Miss Fortune was in her original iteration of her Pool Party skin.
