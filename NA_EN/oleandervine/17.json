It&#039;s ... odd... as to why they&#039;re applying her MS towards her basic attack damage. She&#039;s a support, so I&#039;m not quite sure I understand the relevance of making her basic attacks hit harder, and this new addition to her passive is not only 3/4th irrelevant to her kit, but it also is another massive head-scratcher.\n\nhttps://3.bp.blogspot.com/-k9SGdqxZDMY/WcAkUHomrbI/AAAAAAAAu7Y/VgaXoSqtBSIzDsmabW7vwvSCbwplu7mNQCLcBGAs/s1600/jannapassive.jpg\n\nHer single target spells (meaning Zephyr, her ONLY single target spell) will deal bonus damage based on her MS. This is completely pointless. I don&#039;t understand why there is a push to make her more of a damage dealing support. She&#039;s an enchanter, and her kit is almost 100% utility. Pushing her towards dealing damage IS NOT the direction she needs to go &quot;to be interactive.&quot; It&#039;s bizarre.\n\nFurthermore, there was this new change to the already changed Ardent Censer:\nhttps://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YH7I8XqDi5c/WcAiHMSCMpI/AAAAAAAAu60/F4xXlY66XOQeRq-EYgsgJvQ3MOkU9gVpwCLcBGAs/s1600/ardent.jpg\n\nIt&#039;s now going to apply itself to yourself when you heal or shield. Again, as an Enchanter, who will be applying heals and shields to your allies, your kit will almost be 100% utility, and your offense is negligible. This is another bizarre change, as it doesn&#039;t actually mesh or flow with the concept of an enchanter support. In fact, I cannot think of a single support who will benefit from this meaningfully.\n\nRiot, as these changes to Janna and Ardent show - you&#039;re making some extremely odd directional choices when it comes to Enchanters, choices that are not cohesive to the class. I think this is the wrong direction to take for both Janna and Ardent because you&#039;re adding essentially useless stats to them that why will never utilize to any extent, as their intended role doesn&#039;t require them or ask them to be aggressive auto-attackers. Please reconsider this direction, and take another approach.","replies":[{"poster":"Poop Jelly","date":"2017-09-18T20:44:36.094+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"I welcome it. I've always played janna in the assertive route and making her gameplay more aggressive is fine by me. Scaling with Movement speed as damage to me is actually quite refreshing. Other supports get AP as bonus utility stats, Janna probably the first one to get speed as an additional scaling stat (which makes sense considering she's a wind spirit). \n\nNow I see that when they say making Janna more interactive rather than being a shield defensive support, many think she gets shift power of her kit into something other than true interaction with enemies (aka auto attack), but Idk i still really like the idea. Now she's actually going to do damage and whether it's going to be effective or not, she's not a staying behind support who can't fight/trade for herself anymore. \n\nArdent Censor change is still a bit wonky we will have to look out if it's actually going to ship or if it's going to change.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2017-09-18T20:51:14.766+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"I get that they wanted to make her more interactive, but I don't see this as the way to do it, as it simply doesn't flow with her kit.\n\nI would have personally allowed her spell hits on enemies to give her charges for her shield to increase it's strength (think Taric Q), as I feel that's a clean, simple way to stop her from spamming her shield while also encouraging her to be aggressive on enemies.

Pushing Janna towards autoattacking while also increasing her shield cooldown to 18/16/14/12/10 seconds barely makes sense. She's never gonna trade simply because her shield will always be used to save her ADC from poke, and that's the reason people pick Janna and enchanters in general. These changes are just Soraka over and over again, where they tried to make Soraka interactive by giving her W an 8 second cooldown lmao.\nBetween current Ardent and Janna changes + Brand getting mana back from killing minions with W (when he doesn't because he kills minions by using his W and then E) I think the balance team is clueless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kloqdq","date":"2017-09-19T13:20:23.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get they want janna to be more aggressive and have more interesting gameplay but doing it like this?
