It makes them come across very awkwardly, and doesn't fit the overall already-established cat themed aesthetic of the game.\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/4/45/Hype_Kitty_Emote.png\nhttps://www.mobafire.com/images/news/emotes/excited-kitten.png\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/TRzQZ_f1jyk/maxresdefault.jpg\n\nCan you guys at Riot fix the textures on Meowrick's cats to bring them in line with Meowkai's kittens that we know and love? Making them the orange tabby color is fine, and strong enough to differentiate them from Meowkai's gray kittens, so I don't think having their faces look similar or the bells on their head would or should run into game clarity issues.\n\nEdit: I wanted to add - Meowrick's cats kind of break the immersion in the game because their textures and appearances are trying to hard to be life like, that the absurd outfits and body shapes don't work, whereas a more cartoonized cat like Meowkai's offers more of that suspension of disbelief due to it's distance from life like appearance.","replies":[{"poster":"Placentas","date":"2019-03-05T21:06:28.972+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"I kinda like how they're these machismo pissed off cats lol","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2019-03-05T21:11:55.733+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Placentas,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=E2HL5E6O,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-03-05T21:06:28.972+0000)\n>\n> I kinda like how they're these machismo pissed off cats lol\n\nThey can be machismo pissed off kittens with faces like the red glow emote in my main post.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Reaversal","date":"2019-03-05T20:49:49.403+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"Meowrick's cats need to have actual limbs rather than stubs because of their attack animations.\n\nMeowkai's cats can get away with it because all they do is run up to a target and blow up on them.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2019-03-05T20:51:00.778+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Reaversal,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=E2HL5E6O,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-03-05T20:49:49.403+0000)\n>\n> Meowrick's cats need to have actual limbs rather than stubs because of their attack animations.\n> \n> Meowkai's cats can get away with it because all they do is run up to a target and blow up on them.\n\nThey can have limbs and still aesthetically look like Meowkai's cats. Their face textures aren't even remotely similar, clearly despite the fact that Riot is intending the thematics to be similar with the cat pajamas and kitten minions.\nOne, Meowkai, has cute, cartoon styled kittens. Meowrick has weird lifelike looking kittens. Yet Riot has attempted to merge them both into the same thematic, and it's extremely off putting.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahri Body Pillow","date":"2019-03-06T13:26:57.096+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Yeah we don't care","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Aspect of Idiocy","date":"2019-03-05T23:23:05.059+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, these particular iterations don't really seem to fit the April Fools style that they've established.

He looks in the same vein as Meowkai with the silly pajamas.

But they wouldn't have the head stalk with the bell, and if they were done like tabby orange stripe, they would look different enough from Maokai's, that along with their gait and their build, would differentiate them plenty from Maokai's saplings.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rowanstar","date":"2019-03-20T20:07:03.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is true.
