When you kill the pizza chicken ward, which is a chicken with it&#039;s head through a pizza, the pizza breaks free and rolls around. It&#039;s quite noticeable that there&#039;s no hole where the chicken had it&#039;s head poked through. \r\nAdditionally, and this has been around longer, but Blade Queen Lissandra has the same problem in her recall. Her Iron Maiden that she summons and closes around herself uses her headdress as the face of the maiden, yet there&#039;s distinctly no hole for her head to poke through.\r\n\r\nWhy is Riot against head holes?","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-04-01T04:47:46.135+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, trypophobia is a thing, and while usually it manifests due to clusters of holes on a surface (and could more accurately be described as causing disgust rather than fear) who's not to say that a single hole couldn't cause a reaction in particularly sensitive subjects?\n\nThis is just the first stages of us fixing this terrible problem (trying to get ahead of it before global legislation comes into effect) where we will be removing all holes - including but not limited to:\n\n* Bard's face holes\n* Battlecast Illaoi's boob window\n* Yasuo's flute holes (so that much like _some_ Rioters who play Yasuo, the flute will also be one note)\n* All nostrils\n\nIf there are others you'd like to list then please do so.  It's all in an concerted effort (starting 32nd of March) to help the sufferers of this particular affliction, and not at all about saving a surprising amount of polygon count in a model.","replies":[{"poster":"GinoSoldier","date":"2018-04-01T04:51:27.538+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is pure gold.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nylisa","date":"2018-04-01T09:36:58.976+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"As someone with nasty case of trypophobia this gives me comfort, thanks for thinking of everything guys.\n\n You know whats the first thing google shows you when you search trypophobia?
