And the rest of her kit is pretty well AS reliant. That why the turning point for her was in the ADC update, because they severely nerfed BotRK (Which kinda needed it actually) But then Runnan's got reworked to included Crit chance while reducing the AS.  So their isn't the ridiculous about of kiting that she had, but the rest of her kit suffered as a result. \n\nThis kinda makes me wonder if Riot, really does not want to support any monstrous AS items. If her AS, or if AS itemization gets buffed, she'd be back in her former position. (likely requiring a passive nerf) or You could buff another aspect of her kit.","replies":[{"poster":"dapositiveviking","date":"2016-07-04T03:54:46.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you bring to light an interesring point that Kog'maw, the now attack speed oriented marksman, gets the majority of his attack speed in his kit and is aggressively immobile","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Masala Chai","date":"2016-07-04T00:19:43.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Several reasons why this won't happen:\n\n1.

You would have to reanimate Kalista because then her auto attack animation would be too slow; this would likely require a full VGU, because brushing up the animation like they did for Katarina or Jinx to such a massive extent would make her feel excessively clunky and make it nearly impossible to orbwalk unless your APM is that of a God.\n\n3. If you just get rid of the dash mechanic from even Release Kalista, why should you play Kalista over any other ADC? You took away her mobility, so now she is just another immobile ADC. Why on earth would you pick Kalista over something like Ashe, Kog'Maw, Vayne or Twitch? Ashe, Kog'Maw, and Twitch have far safer auto attack ranges (even if only temporarily), Ashe has much better utility in the fact that her vision is global, and so is her arrow. Vayne, Kog'Maw and Twitch can shred tanks (and entire teams) far easier than Kalista can while not being dependent on an auto attack from a support with a rather slow AA animation (looking at you, Annie and Lulu) or low attack range (Braum, Blitzcrank). Vayne and Twitch also have evasive means to avoid damage through Tumble and Ambush.

The problem with Kalista, however, is that her gameplay stats are also nerfed, there is almost no champion which has to have lower AA wind-ups and no other champion which does not have 100% scaling auto-attacks. \n\nRiot could just get rid of that passive and then remove ALL the things that are currently hindering her.","replies":[{"poster":"Masala Chai","date":"2016-07-04T14:07:43.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"If you just get rid of the dash mechanic from even Release Kalista, why should you play Kalista over any other ADC?

It has no relevance to her kit other than to give her kiting. I don't think restricting it will make it better.
