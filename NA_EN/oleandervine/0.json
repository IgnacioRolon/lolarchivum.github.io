They offer a touch more than a plain recolor, and they add such flavor to the skins that these are very much worth the RP you charge for them. Up until these, Chromas have felt iffy and it&#039;s been a hard sell (at least for me) to justify having a real world cost - these new Chromas are well done, and give a little bit of extra oomph to the skins. You guys should definitely use these Chromas as the baseline for how Chromas should be in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Jedahs","date":"2017-03-08T08:05:49.387+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol i've actually never seen them side by side like that before, looks pretty fun","replies":[{"poster":"SchaakaKon","date":"2017-03-09T02:43:43.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will champions with effects as part of their character (Brand, Xerath ect..) ever get a chroma?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Resolution","date":"2017-03-08T13:06:54.972+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fact we got changing faces on Meow-Kai.
