At points in my early game, I had like 3-5 chimes in the enemy jungle and maybe 1 on my side. Bard is never in a good position to grab those chimes unless his team has a good lead. I saw that the designers said that they'd occasionally spawn in hard to reach places, but my experience seems to have it be a touch excessive. \nAdditionally, the chimes currently don't offer enough reward for their gathering, other than the Meeps. If I take time to wander, I don't get nearly enough XP to keep a steady pace and I find myself behind when I need the chimes to bring me up to potential. This is an awful Catch-22.\n\nThat brings us to the Meeps. I feel like due to Bard's pitiful clearing abilities (and the somewhat absurd notion that he's deemed a secondary Mage), his second milestone in the chime collecting should give the Meeps the cone splash effect; this will help his poor clearing/teamfighting, and also help him land his Meep slows on those cowardly enemies. After these essential two milestones, everything else should be pretty much as it is.\n\nEDIT: Something I forgot. I've had instances where I'm in a straight line between me and an enemy champ with a row of minions going perpendicular to us. I've shot my Q, thinking it will pass through a minion in the line and stun the champ behind, only to have the Q bolt completely change direction and hit another minion, instead of passing straight through to the champ. It is my thought that Q should have champion prioritization so as to assist in stunning in tight quarters with minions. \n\nTL:DR - Chimes spawn in enemy territory an awful lot. Chimes don't feel rewarding, they feel gating, especially for the effort you put into the hunt. The second chime milestone should make the Meeps have the cone splash to help Bard land his slows and give him some marginal AOE with just a few chimes.\n\nPSA to ADCs: Learn support classes. Know what they do and how they do it. It makes you a better ADC. If I'm Bard and you see me make a ball of light near a turret when you're nearly dead, don't stare at it and farm near enemies like you're clueless. Grab it so you don't die.","replies":[{"poster":"BeerOfRoot4843","date":"2015-03-15T08:37:13.882+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Chimes don't feel rewarding\"\n\nBS.

If you miss your binding, you've got no way to defend yourself outside of your ult. Nami, Thresh, Braum, Leona, Lulu and Janna all have multiple options for CC and creating distance, and many of them are also tanky, and have instant-satisfaction utility.\n\nWhile I don't think Bard is outright bad, Bard players need to work much, much harder than other supports to get bang for their utility buck.\n\nPlaying Bard and Thresh back to back is like night and day in terms of the feeling of agency.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knight SoIaire ","date":"2015-03-15T19:04:56.402+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"well its either that chimes give too little reward for the time you waste collecting them or bard doesnt get eanough roaming power to pick themm up as fast as he should \n\npersonaly i think its the former just like you because his roaming power comes from chimes which can already be far away \n\nbut then there is also the thing about the chimes cap ... its 150 even if you devote 100% of your time to collect them you will need over 1,5 of an hour to get that \nand those chimes are kinda core to his power \n\nhe is well made but wasnt tuned propertly","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kitten of Evil","date":"2015-03-15T15:56:16.937+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chimes need to be tuned up a bit. If it takes 5 chimes per upgrade, and 145 to \"complete\" the upgrades, they need to spawn more often. Currently it's 2 chimes per 50 seconds (except at 1:40 and 2:30, when only one chime spawns)... that means 145 chimes have not spawned until almost 61 minutes into a game, and that would also assume that you don't miss a single chime.\n\nAs a tip: chimes always spawn at 50 seconds on the dot, so 0:50, 1:40, 2:30 and so on. They spawn somewhat near where you are at that moment. So if you can time it so you're in safe territory (or in your bot lane) at that exact moment, they will spawn closer to you.\n\nMeeps should also have a toggle feature (think Muramana), because they are a good chunk of Bard's damage, and if you help your team take (or defend) an objective, you will not have any meeps for the next teamfight or skirmish.\n\n**TL;DR** I know \"don't rush to judgment on a champion\", but in Bard's case, many of his Meep upgrades are literally impossible to ever reach in a normal game, due to the current spawn rate of chimes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wheatloaf","date":"2015-03-15T18:55:25.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His Q looks awkward sometimes, because the second missile (the one looking to attach to a second target) will always travel in a trajectory based on where the first enemy was when you hit them, not where they've moved to, but the tether will still stay attached to them. Thus, when you hit a moving target, the ability can seem to move in ways it really shouldn't, despite the fact that's it's functioning perfectly normally.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2015-03-15T17:55:20.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bard's ultimate also has limited use as a peel since the stasis is not instant, which makes clutch saves and deterring chasing opponents excessively difficult.

Can you imagine farming in mid-lane, instantly being put into 2.5 seconds of stasis from a Bard who is roaming by dragon? That would be incredibly OP.
