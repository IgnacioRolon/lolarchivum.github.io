What his lore did, at least the beginning with him being a bloodthirsty asshole bent on ruining everything in Ionia and becoming a destructive force like that he was seeking to resist, was ruin him. It stripped his inherent insanity and made him just another empowered human. It removed him from the realm of myth and faerie tales and anchored him too much into reality. Where he should have been akin to one of the faeries that Lulu met in her secret glade, he&#039;s just a former human who&#039;s lost touch with the world and become a strange guardian. \r\nIvern was set up to be this great mythical creature similar to Bard, but a native inhabitant of Runeterra. Instead, he isn&#039;t, and the enigma and whimsy is lost when you remember who he was once and that it is what drives him to be what he wants to be. He should operate in the name of nature alone, he should have been a creature of nature, it&#039;s always protector, not some step in protector from the world of man. This is what is disappointing about his lore, his orignition from mankind.","replies":[{"poster":"Tattersall","date":"2016-09-23T01:52:23.000+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"They tried to convey this point in his lore:\n\nHumans are still a part of nature.\n\nThey're not separate beings, they're not unnatural, they're just animals.

What makes us so unique and sets us apart from the rest of the animal kingdom, though, is our ability to moralize and rationalize. With that as a given, I find it rather puzzling that Ivern would be ok with humans slaughtering other non-human animals needlessly. Killing something for its skin isn't exactly what I'd categorize as a necessity, unless you need it so much that you would die otherwise.\n\nIt's for this reason that I was rather put off by Ivern's lore. \"The shagyak herd would be proud\" why, exactly? Because one of their kin was killed to be used as a pair of boots?","replies":[{"poster":"Tattersall","date":"2016-09-23T19:50:14.752+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ivern has conversations with dirt.

If I had to guess, I would say that everything is sentient, but not in a way that we can comprehend.  Like, the Vikings believed that everything had a will.  Rocks and trees as well as humans.  Even the universe had a collective will, but everything also had individual wills too.  The Vikings believed that magic was the art of changing \"destiny,\" or making something happen that was not \"supposed\" to happen, whether that's persuading someone to buy something that they wouldn't have bought normally, or persuading a rock to lift itself up and throw itself at someone.\n\nVikings were cool.\n\nDang it, I got off topic.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that humans are the only \"sentient\" creatures, but the definition of sentient is different for a god-willow.  Ivern can see the will of all individual things, and to him, that will is no different from that of humans.  Hopefully this makes sense.  I kind of doubt that it does.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TenshouSNK","date":"2016-09-24T03:33:44.976+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tattersall,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=o2QzfEub,comment-id=000500000000,timestamp=2016-09-23T19:50:14.752+0000)\n>\n> Ivern has conversations with dirt.

There are so many human redeeming the natural world or saving a race. See Malzahar, The Aspects, the Ascended, and a host of others. This is a character that should be random and enigmatic.

It shows why he's the way he is, and it isn't just \"he's magic\".\n\nLike, as much as I love Bard, he's not really a compelling...character.  He has no story arc, he's not going to change, Bard is just Bard, and he always will be Bard.  Ivern feels different that way.  I can see why you might not be a fan of that, but I think a lot of people like it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ethereal311","date":"2016-09-23T16:23:56.066+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thing is that he's not actively seeking to redeem himself from what I've seen written in the bio.
