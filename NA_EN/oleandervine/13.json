Her strength is still locked out until milestones, now governed by time more than anything. In the matches I've played with the new numbers, it still takes more time than necessary to get her to where she needs to be to not be dead weight against champions who can quickly overwhelm her while she is still struggling to bring herself to their level. Regardless of whether or not she's \"OP\" and an end game melter of faces, this is not the direction that Cassiopeia should have been pushed into. \nSecondly, the overloading of E is becoming an issue. I'm sure you've heard the KISS acronym before. Keep It Simple, Stashu. E at the moment is excessively overloaded and does entirely too much. As many have mentioned before, we don't like an E centric Cassiopeia kit with her poisons as an afterthought. An amp on E is appreciated, but it doesn't get back to the problems she has - she is a flimsy mage with pitiful range with E, and forcing her into close proximity against almost any other mid retards her effectiveness. With her posions only lasting 2-3 seconds unless the opponent is camping in a Miasma, this amp is ineffective at giving power back to her poisons, and only serves to inflame her mana problems. \nThat leads us to W and R. W is effectively useless, even with the amp. 13 damage amplified by 20% barely breaks 15 damage. Almost all champions can soak it up and ignore Miasma entirely. This is a problem, especially when we have other champions like Teemo, Singed, and Twitch who have more effective poisons than she does, the poison mage. That's just wrong. R has major issues in that there is a cast time. No one else has this weird, uncalled for cast time on a spell like this. Unlike champions like Zyra, who has a projectile multitarget root, Cassiopeia has a point blank stun that is akin to Lissandra's W and shouldn't have a cast time. Why does her looking at someone have a cast time? In so many instances where her R should have saved me, it hasn't, because that uncalled for cast time has given the foe too much time to end me. An ultimate should be an ultimate, not some gappy low rate spell that is easily thwarted; this especially since Cassiopeia has to be point blank to use it. Please fix it.\nAnd finally, one other major issue with Cassiopeia is her death animation. On every single skin other than Jade Fang, when she breaks apart, the model reverts back to the old classic model. Fix it. This has been an issue since well before her rework.\n\nAs a reccomendation, strip E of all of it's bells and whistles. Return it to it's pre-rework state. Drop her passive, give her ratios back to her Q, W, and R, and give her a new passive. Here's my suggestion:\nWhenever Cassiopeia kills a poisoned unit, she gains 1% of her max mana. Every fourth spell cast has 10% spell vamp.\nWe simply want Cassiopeia to be a poison mage. As in a mage who's sole purpose is to cast poisons at people. We done like an E focused kit. Please fix her.","replies":[{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2014-12-15T00:02:08.278+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":3,"body":"I'm just going to **TL;DR** this.\n\n*In her entire kit, the most out of character ability for a Poison Mage is her E.

And it's pretty easy to see why:\n\nOriginally, Cassiopeia's E would reset to 0.5 seconds **upon damaging a poisoned enemy**.\n\nThen, a 0.7 second reset was added **upon casting Twin Fang on a poisoned enemy**. The original reset was not changed, however, so if the cooldown was above 0.5 seconds it would reset to 0.5 seconds upon damaging a poisoned enemy.\n\nHowever, Twin Fang **has a missile speed**. The 0.7 second reset compensates for the missile speed, thus making long-ranged Twin Fangs and short-ranged Twin Fangs have, most of the time, the cooldown they ought to have, but adding a bit of extra reliability should the poison tick away in the transit period of Twin Fang.\n\nThe E timer was being reset to 0.7 seconds **intentionally** because otherwise Cassiopeia's Twin Fang would be getting a large buff.\n\nimho, a much better way to do it would have been to add a flag to the start of the code block--\n\n>(Cast Twin Fang)\n>'A' is now false.\n>Target Poisoned? 'A' is now true.\n-\n>(Enemy is hit by Twin Fang)\n>'A' is true? Set cooldown to 0.5 seconds.\n\nInstead of the original\n\n>(Enemy is hit by Twin Fang)\n>Target poisoned? Set cooldown to 0.5 seconds.\n\nor the current\n\n>(Cast Twin Fang)\n>Target poisoned? Set cooldown to 0.5 seconds. (Originally this was 0.7)\n-\n>(Enemy is hit by Twin Fang)\n>Target poisoned?

In fact, being a DoT actually makes it WEAKER in theory because DoT actually has COUNTER-PLAY built in by nature. A powerful long-ranged Q with another ability that lets a champion wave-clear is nothing exclusive to a DoT champion. Not to mention her Q wasn't anywhere near as powerful as most other lane-bullies.\n\n\nDo you know why she was frustrating before? Because she can harass with her Q and do decent damage...all the while being 100% un-approachable due to how hard she shits on anyone trying to get within range to harass her thanks to her E's raw power. Her E didn't force her to be interactive with the opponent, **it forced the opponent to NEVER interact with Cassiopeia.**\n\nDo you know what the difference is now? Before the opponent choose not to get within her E-range for the sake of their own well-being, now they choose to stay out of it because they know she is a non-issue unless they specifically walk into that range.\n\n\nThe rework could just as easily have been Q-centric.

There are already numerous characters with spamable burst. There are next to none that specialize in DOTs. \nIf you had chosen to change her DOTs into single targets rather than AoE, that would have been fine. If those single target poisons were her kit focus and the bulk of her damage output, that would retain her identity as a poison mage. I've never said, nor have others, that she absolutely has to have AoE poisons to retain her identity. The AoE is something that was fun, but the core principle here is that she needs to have a focus on poison. Same holds true for her range, but in that case, if you are giving her a crippled range, she needs beefier compensation and ratio numbers that don't hinge on building pure AP. With her miserable ratios on everything but Twin Fangs, she cannot afford to build anything but AP in order to make her poisons have impact. This is where the AP boosts in her passive cripple her, as their bonus coupled with the AP she is building is the only way to make her damage output viable. If the passive power shackles are dropped, her ratios increased, coupled with single target and short range poisons, this would be ideal for her to build tankier and be more balancing, as she can build better defenses to take advantage of getting in close without having her be entirely destroyed by close range burst.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-12-15T23:05:09.638+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Stashu,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MW8qR21j,comment-id=000b,timestamp=2014-12-15T22:06:38.607+0000)\n> This is the main point.

While it might alleviate the primary concerns you had in the rework, which seems to be curbstomp her early game, it makes her kit *feel* super awkward when she can no longer permanently keep an enemy poisoned... as the primary poison champ in the game.

With a lot of recent designs, Reds seem to be trying to push what's possible in the game, so it's possible that Stashu really wanted to push this late-game direction of Cassiopeia since he saw a lot of potential in this direction, thus the passive was born. When he took a step back, however, he saw that her kit was pretty stacked at this point, and had to nerf everything to try to keep her balanced (undershooting as is typical of releases these days because it's probably healthier for the game to have underpowered champions steadily buffed rather than some broken champion released and everyone panics).\n\nAgain, all just speculation, but if this is remotely true, perhaps it would be best to look towards something like making Cassiopeia scale less aggresively into late game, keeping some buffs to her laning, but giving her more late-game utility, like Syndra or Orianna have?","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-12-16T00:01:33.007+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Possible.

She's never going to grab Attack Speed, so she's relying entirely on her Ability Power stat to give her pushing power-- most ADCs are capable of clearing a wave in just a few seconds (curse you less-than sign for being broken), while Cassiopeia does take about the same amount of time, she has to expend mana to do so (and will not always be able to recover it all via Twin Fang).","replies":[{"poster":"Mandaari","date":"2014-12-18T17:22:15.156+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Turret damage is a problem with virtually all AP champs.

A DoT character needs to be at least one of three things in order to be effective and not useless:\n\n--Hyper mobile (Teemo) so the character can duck in and out of combat to trade effectively\n--Super tanky (Singed) so the character can survive long enough for his/her poisons to deal enough damage\n--Extra-long ranged (Cassiopeia) so the character can stay out of reach of retaliation that would kill him/her\n\nThe character does not need to be all three of these, and in fact is most balanced and effective when he/she is crippled in one of the other departments (Singed's range is nonexistant, Teemo's tankiness is nonexistant, Cass's tankiness is nonexistant) but that must be coupled with one of the above extremes. \n\nWhat would Singed be like if he wasn't super tanky? What would Teemo be like if he wasn't super mobile? That's what you've done to Cass by making her so E-focused. You've taken away her primary asset and have not compensated by removing her greatest weakness. That is why she feels like shit to play, even if she's actually strong: being a close-ranged mage does not fit with being a super-squishy DoT character. It wouldn't feel right even if E one-shot tanks. Power is irrelevant here, she feels like shit because her current design is shit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2014-12-15T22:57:34.702+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":">     Have a strong early game\n>     Be long range\n>     Do mostly AoE damage\n>     Have short cast times, etc.\n> \n\nThis is a matter of archetype expression.\n\nWhile I agree with you that a DoT champion doesn't necessarily have to have all those qualities, however, the archetype of a Poison-centric mage, imo, SHOULD come with a few fantasy fullfilling baggage that people desire from it.\n\n\n1) They're often \"cowardly\" individuals who relies on Poison to achieve what they could not physically achieve without it.\n\ne.g - [Fiora's Father...The Nameless Mr. Laurent](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Fiora/Background) is a dirty cheat and a coward...he can not possibly win a proper duel.\n\nThis is why I (and probably just me) feel that being a super-late game god is ill-fitting of the archetype. I feel that an individual who relies on poison should never have any ultra strong-point as that's too \"combative\" by nature. Too Vayne-like. \n\n2) If one's poison is **gaseous in nature**, having powerful AoE effect IS kind of what you'd want if you're spreading it all over. Think Koffing/Weezing and how that Pokemon fills whatever room he's in with his smoke, yet outside of like, Sludge, he doesn't have much else to look forward to in terms of a 1v1 situation.\n\n\nAs for short cast-times, yeah I agree it has little to nothing to do with poisoning, but rather **I think** it's a reaction to the fact that her MS boost comes from needing to land a skillshot on an opponent whereas other champions simply have to press a button. I can live with her being as she is with her MS buff being much less free, but probably not as the AP Rambo she currently is where getting up close and personal is her only pattern. But this is getting more on the \"balance\"-side of things and I'm more concerned with gameplay\n----------------\nAs a counterpoint of what many of us want poison to be, **yet can totally work**. I guess there is the case of a venomous spider. If we have a venomous spider champion, she can be \n\n* melee\n* single-target damage in nature as her leaps in to sink her fangs into a single target\n\n\nIn short, I guess a DoT-assassin is where a single-target short-ranged poison-champion could work out. HOWEVER, when I look at Cassiopeia filling the air with her poison gas and all her surly lines, I get something completely different from that.\n\nTHAT is why I feel Cassiopeia could be more of a **long-ranged AoE DoT champion** who possesses a **Ziggs-like ability to defend herself**(read:basically none at all) if engaged upon.\n\n\nDo you see a difference then? Cassiopeia is a noblewoman, she is represented by an animal normally associated with cowardice and treachery. People see her as spreading a gaseous poison (btw, her Q's CD is longer than it's poison duration...). For someone like that, E offers too much all-inning power whereas it feels like such an archetype should be more focused on staying far away to inflict her vile poison while her henchmen (allied players) keeps the enemy in place. Her E should be the final *\"dagger in the back\"* where she sneaks in to deal the killing blow.\n\n\n**PS** - yes I know we technically have {{champion:60}} for my example, but I'm talking about a hypothetical spider whose bites inflicts DoT","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tik115","date":"2014-12-16T18:33:18.641+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Stashu,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MW8qR21j,comment-id=000b,timestamp=2014-12-15T22:06:38.607+0000)\n>\n> This is the main point.
