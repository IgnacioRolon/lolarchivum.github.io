Having an off meta pick played by a pro often legitimizes the pick to some extent, but that's not the whole story here.\n\nThe whole story is that if you play MF support, you start off as a support and then become the team's second (or third, or fourth) marksman later on. Unlike mage and tank supports who become more utility focused as time goes on, MF support becomes a carry; albeit one that's a bit lacking in gold compared to the actual ADC.\n\nBasically, people are playing MF support because they got matched as a support but want to be a carry, and the pro pick gives them a convenient excuse to play marksman #2 instead of a traditional support.\n\nRiot should be taking notes here.
