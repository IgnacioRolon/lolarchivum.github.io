About the worst thing he does is clip some sentence beginnings, but the rest of his language doesn't indicate that's he uneducated or poor with his grammar. I mean, this would also be more understandable for someone who's like a mercenary and a meathead, but again, we see this man is a collector of artifacts, and one who is also skilled enough with translating ancient texts - which requires a pretty well based understanding in your own spoken and written langauges. Furthermore, he doesn't fall prey to the bad grammar later on, as seen here:\n\n\"I am sorry to inform you, Ezreal, that the Guild** has **once again denied your application.\"\n\nIt feels severely out of place, even if it is intentional, because his general grasp on language doesn't indicate that he's bad with his grammar and diction.","replies":[{"poster":"Dobiwobi","date":"2018-10-05T19:44:26.930+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Ice Weasel X","date":"2018-10-06T05:48:05.792+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dobiwobi,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=xooGh8ve,comment-id=000200020000,timestamp=2018-10-05T19:44:26.930+0000)\n>\n> in british english, people use it this way\n> \n> for example, when referring to a football team, a brit would say &quot;Chelsea aren&#x27;t very good this season&quot; etc. \n> \n> in american english it would ofc be singular, but januk maybe speaks british english or some variant like australian english\n\nIn American English, collective nouns can still use both singular and plural verbs, depending on the situation.

However, collective nouns having both singular and plural usage is something I was definitely taught in grade school.  I probably had similar reading habits as you since my older sister's a fantasy geek, so I was constantly exposed to a mix of archaic, overly formal, or completely non-historic language in the books she lent me.  It's one of the reasons I remember the topic of collective nouns from school so vividly (the other reason is that the topic was taught in different years).  Something I previously had attributed to style for atmosphere's sake ended up being explained in English class.  \"The council agree.\"  It sounds weird, but it's grammatically sound.\n\nI don't believe there is such a rule prohibiting both singular and plural uses of a collective noun in a single written piece, so long as each instance is individually in agreement with its purpose by restating the noun itself.  For clarity's sake, it may be recommended against, similarly to using the same pronoun several times to refer to multiple different parties (e.g., \"Caitlyn shot at Jinx because she tried to kill her every time she saw her.\"  Is Caitlyn defending herself or is she the instigator?).  Using the collective noun once and then applying both singular and plural versions to it, however, does seem wrong.\n\n* \"The Dallas Cowboys is an NFL team.  The Dallas Cowboys are all men.\"  This may cause a double-take, but I don't really think it's against the rules.  In this case, the proper noun uses a plural form, but can still be taken as a singular entity.\n* \"The Dallas Cowboys is an NFL team.  They are all men.\"  This definitely seems problematic, as it is inconsistent and does not \"redefine/reinitialize\" the term's scope.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Chibi Bronzlife","date":"2018-10-06T04:13:37.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see what you're going for here, and understand the difficulties.

A guild is a collective of individuals - when you're discussing the guild, you're talking about the collective as a single unit, not as their components. \nSo the **guild** _IS_ angry with you. The guild **members** _ARE_ angry with you.\nThere are very very few words in the English language that function as their singular and plural forms, and \"guild\" is not one of them. \nProper nouns still follow these same rules, especially in regards to groups with a name. \nThe **Order of the Banana** is upset with you.

The **members** of the Order of the Banana are upset with you.\n\nWell, sort of.  You've mentioned the key word: collective.  A collective noun _can_ switch between singular and plural verbs, depending on context.  Which is correct relies on whether the individuals within the collective are acting separately, but the collective noun can still be used in both cases.  There aren't specific words which have this ability.  It's a regular attribute of collective nouns.\n\nThis is something I remember from grade school English lessons, because it's an odd piece of grammar that often sounds odd to many people.\n\nHere's an article about the subject: http://learnersdictionary.com/qa/Collective-Nouns-and-Verb-Agreement","replies":[]}]}]}]}
