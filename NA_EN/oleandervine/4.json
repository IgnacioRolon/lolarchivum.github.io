All of the epicness from before is just gone.","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":96,"down_votes":37,"body":"Before, we had a hellacious warlord who used necromancy to become a lich of sorts, with his spirit residing in his armor, while his bones were the key to his downfall. He conquered. He was fucking unstoppable. It took someone (probably LeBlanc) stealing his skull and having it sealed away on the Blessed Isles to stop him. That's how epically powerful he was. He crushed mortals underfoot. He was undefeatable, and would have conquered everything if not for betrayal from within. And with the Isles blowing open with the Ruined King's actions, his skull was free to be reunited with his other bones, and reanimate his armor, allowing him to roam free again.\n\nHis new bio? It strips EVERY. SINGLE. BIT. of power out of him. He's not longer an accomplished necromancer. He's just some stupid, idiot barbarian wishing to go to the equivalent of the halls of Valhalla. When his religion turned out to be a dud and he was stuck in limbo, he managed to whisper to cultists to bind his soul to some metal armor so he could roam free again. He did, until more cultists severed those bonds, and now he's corrupting the souls of those he killed while he's in purgatory again.\nAll of the legendary nature that he once encompassed is lost entirely. His one weakness, his bones, are gone, his intellect as both a warlord AND a necromancer is gone. Now he's just some random, bloodthirsty guy who killed a lot of people. He's a diluted, watered down version of who Mordekaiser used to be, and his story lacks any kind of mythological impact his previous lore used to have.\n\nThis isn't really Mordekaiser to me anymore. He's just some meathead Viking who got pissed Valhalla wasn't real. He's not an unstoppable force like he used to be, he's not a world ending threat like he used to be. He's just another irritating blip on the radar of all of the supernatural entities causing havoc in the world.\n\nAnd the biggest question of all is why? Why did he lore have to change? It was already sufficiently updated to make him an epic part of the mythology of the world. He was damn near perfect in how he fit with everything, and bridged areas like Noxus and the Shadow Isles. What was wrong with his previous lore that it necessitated such a massive overhaul that was clearly a downgrade?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Pls","date":"2019-05-30T08:04:42.354+0000","up_votes":81,"down_votes":10,"body":"Hey! Morde's writer here. Appreciate you sharing your thoughts!\n\nA couple thoughts to share back. \n\nFirst, know that with any champion rework, we first seek to understand as deeply as possible what makes a champion great, what excites players about that champion, and what are the core essences that define who that champion is. From there, we set out to craft their place in wider Runeterra. Any change has the potential to be painful. Know that the folks on the team are all highly passionate players and story geeks to the Nth degree; no change was made lightly, and no expansion or shifted emphasis was done without heavy thought and robust discussion. \n\nOne of the things I most appreciate about being at Riot is the space and time we give projects to do things as right as possible. Do we miss the mark sometimes? Well, to be human is to err. (Unless you're Mordekaiser. Then you just cease being human. :P) But I am grateful to have teams who are super passionate and knowledgeable all working to craft something to share that excites us and, we hope, the players that love this content. \n\nOnto some Morde specific thoughts:\n\n1) Mordekaiser is an extremely accomplished necromancer - a soul of iron will and arcane power, and a warlord of deep intellect.\n\nMordekaiser defied death by sheer force of will - a feat literally no other mortal on Runeterra had accomplished. The ghosts of the Shadow Isles are in the living realm because of a magical catastrophe; Mordekaiser _refused to accept the reality around him_. He gained necromantic powers in the death realm by listening to the maddening whispers of souls and *deciphering an unspoken language* over untold time, teaching himself Ochnun. (I barely learned some broken Spanish after 4 years of studying, so, uh, there's that.) Through those profane whispers, he also figured out how to speak across the veil of death and deceive mortals into thinking they could bring him back and bind him to their will - only to slaughter them all. Once returned, he didn't kill without a plan, despite what his enemies thought:\n\n> To his foes, it seemed he cared only for massacre and destruction. Entire generations perished under his relentless campaigns.\n\n> However, there was far more to Mordekaiser’s plan. He raised the Immortal Bastion at the center of his empire; while most assumed it was merely a seat of power, some came to know the secrets it held. Mordekaiser hungered for all the forbidden knowledge of spirits and death, and a true understanding of the realm… or realms… beyond.\n\nMordekaiser sought out more arcane knowledge about the dead and about spirits, growing his necromantic powers while doing what he did best in his first life - conquering - all to serve his bigger purpose. He also built an impossible physical monument to his power that has secrets yet untold.  \n\nAnd all of that empowered him to harvest souls, grow his necromantic power, and build an army of spirits bound to his will. It takes a necromancer of some power to exert such control.\n\nAlso, Mordekaiser's rebuke of death was so thorough that he learned how to forge his own afterlife and realm. He is a necromancer not bound to physical totems or phylacteries, but has managed to reject the very cycle of life and death that seemed his destiny.\n\n2) Mordekaiser is the warlord that inspired the entire Noxian empire. \n\nTake a look at his quote: \"Destiny. Domination. Deceit.\" You might find it maps to the Noxian / Trifarix principles of strength: \"Vision, Might, Guile.\" Consciously or not, Mordekaiser's legacy spawned an entire culture that emulated his conquests and his philosophies. Yet to him, Noxians are a watered down imitation of his previous glory. At the same time, to every day Noxians, his legacy as a conqueror is of mythic proportions - legends so big, they are hard to believe as history. (A real world comparison is the Romulus and Remus mythos around the founding of Rome.)\n\n3) Mordekaiser is an unstoppable threat and a major force that looms over Runeterra. \n\nHis first return, when his necromantic powers were new, resulted in a massive period of tyrannical rule that took both betrayal from within and united enemies from without to stop him. Now, he has amassed an army of souls, collected powerful arcane knowledge, and has plans and machinations in place...\n\n4) There was a lot of discussion that led to Morde no longer being associated with the Shadow Isles.\n\nIt was not a decision we made lightly. In fact, I originally argued against it, but came to agree with our narrative lead and lead editor on why it is the stronger story choice. \n\nUltimately, we made the call due to a number of factors: \n\n**Death magic and necromancers exist beyond the Shadow Isles.**\nRuneterra is a big place, with a long history. The Shadow Isles was just one (albeit enormous) cataclysmic event that caused a specific area of Runeterra to become frozen in time, and to have a very specific form of undeath permeate the land. Ultimately, Mordekaiser's old connection to Shadow Isles felt primarily driven by a feeling that we had to shoehorn him into our \"ghost faction\". In our current storytelling efforts, we're interested in expanding our factions out beyond some of those wide (and as a result flat) characterizations that were made in years past. Another great example of this is how Demacia is more than just \"the good guys\" faction, as seen in how they deal with their relationship to magic, brought to the forefront with Sylas and Lux's story (shameless comic plug here - go read it!). \n\n**Questions of geography / narrative complexity**\nIn terms of our geography, Shadow Isles is far flung from where the Immortal Bastion is. (Yay, Runeterra Map!) While I loved the idea that it took taking Morde's remains across the world to prevent him from returning, ultimately it felt honoring Morde's connections to the Immortal Bastion yielded more rich storytelling space. It also simplified a narrative beat in his backstory, allowing me to zero in on his arc and agency, rather than a moment of denied choice where outside forces moved him, and then an outside cataclysm happened to bring him back. \n\n**I wanted Mordekaiser to shed all mortal weakness.**\nA big guiding star for me was the question, \"what makes Morde metal and terrifying and unique?\" How do we take \"necromantic warlord\" and push him to an 11? One answer that excited us - rather than having a physical weakness of his mortal remains, what if he shed just about everything that made him remotely human? To me, his title, \"The Iron Revenant,\" served a lot of inspiration in this regard, and further cemented the pivot away from his remains being a major weakness or vulnerability. \n\n5) For a character like Mordekaiser, who spans massive swaths of Runeterra's timeline and history, his story has large impacts on larger reaching histories and stories we are setting up to tell.\n\nClarifying and focusing Mordekaiser's story in allows us to help make greater sense of many other characters and champs. Some stories are just subtle hints right now, breadcrumbs that I can't wait to explore more fully in other outlets than just Mordekaiser's bio.\n\nThis leads to some more general thoughts in regards to writing for Riot and League: \n\n6) A huge challenge of being a narrative writer on League of Legends is the space in which we get to tell the story of a champion. \n\nIn game, the main narrative outlet is a champ's voiceover script - a very specific set of lines, with very tight gameplay constraints on length. It definitely has its strengths and weaknesses as a storytelling expression.\n\nOut of game, we have a champ's biography and color story. A bio is, by its nature, more summary than story, more exposition told as evocatively as possible than scene-driven in depth storytelling. Our color stories are also a very specific length, and are crafted to give a very specific snapshot of the champion in action. With a champ that's larger than life like Mordekaiser, this means that there's much that remains untold in full, many details that must be summarized, and TONS of story space that is ripe for deeper exploration in future storytelling endeavors. And honestly, that's part of the joy as well - leaving tantalizing questions for players to ask, to explore, to theorize, and to discover.\n\nFor now, I have to leave Mordekaiser with his Bio, VO, and color story. But if players are excited to learn more about his history, I hope we'll have more opportunities to expand and explore as we continue to strive as a narrative team to help move Runeterra's events forward in time. \n\nWhew, this got quite long - apologies! I hope these thoughts were interesting, and helped to answer a bit of the question \"why did his lore have to change?\" as well as address some of your feelings that he isn't the epic, metal champ he was! Thanks for reading and caring about Mordekaiser, this game, and our world and story as much as you do, and sharing that with us. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2019-05-30T11:13:14.293+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":1,"body":"I was just typing up an essay to defend this awesome piece of new lore but hey, I guess you beat me to it here!

One of the most important lessons I’ve learned in writing professionally is understanding no matter what you do, some folks will hate it - just as (hopefully, anyway!) some will love it - and that audiences and even your professional collaborators will have different styles and skills at giving critical, craft-centric feedback. I think it’s amazing (and also sometimes overwhelming) that especially in this industry, we can get immediate impressions and feedback from audiences, as well as more objective data, about reception around a piece of creative work. Learning how to distill all that down to useful takeaways is definitely a learned skill (and sometimes exhausting given the sheer volume!). \n\nPlus, creative work that is inherently subjective means there will always be differences in taste. As a gamer, lore nerd, and passionate writer of fantasy, my goal and approach is to leverage my skills to tell the best stories I can to help make the most fun gameplay, all with input and collaboration from some of the most talented folks in the industry. Some people will like it. Others will have actionable feedback. Others just need to vent about how mad it made them. But always, as a creator, seeing the gap between my intention (what emotions am I aiming to invoke? What story elements am I hoping you take away?) and the intended audience’s reception is hugely informative. The trick is learning to filter out or read through any perceived harshness of language - and of course, to ignore any fundamentally caustic or bad faith engagements (which the OP’s post was not).\n\nI can nerd out about craft and feedback all day, but I a) have a project I should be writing for and b) should avoid typing another novel of a post, so I’ll end it here!

We don't really get an impression in his bio that he IS a necromancer or even indulged in that kind of magic as a means to conquer the world. We're just told that he killed some mages who summoned him, then absorbed their souls in his enchanted mace. Here's a paragraph where I believe a bulk of the confusion lies:\n\n\"Thus began his second conquest of the mortal realm. As before, his ambitions were great, only now empowered by necromantic sorceries he could never have previously imagined. From the fearful, dissipating souls of the sorcerers, Mordekaiser forged a weapon fit for an emperor of death—his brutal mace, Nightfall—and seized control of the army they had raised.\"\n\nIt's not immediately clear that Mordekaiser is now using necromancy, because being summoned and bound in armor can qualify as being empowered by necromantic sorceries (whereas previously he was just a human). Additionally, nothing previous to this paragraph explains why and how he suddenly learned necromancy by killing some mages. It's not a proper flow of understanding, because we're not told he learned it in purgatory from the whispers of Ochnun, and it's not established in League lore that you learn the magical trade of sorcerers if you kill them, so the understanding that he may be using necromancy is poorly established, and feels forced in trying to link it to what we understood as a previously un-magical warlord. Even willing yourself to resist fading from the Spirit Realm doesn't immediately grant you necromantic powers either, so overall, it seems really glazed over, whereas his old lore has him firmly established as a necromancer/warlord hybrid who was well learned in both crafts.\n\nI also feel that the removal of his mortal weaknesses weakens him as a character, and takes away the mythological nature of him as an entity. Joseph Cambell is one of the leading experts on myth and legend, and I feel like there's a lot to take away from his insight on the human epic, the hero, the villain, and saving the day. Myths and legends persist to this day because of how classic the tales are. Having old Mordekaiser as the villain who's 99% undefeatable unless you disturb his remains was the perfect setting for making him a mythical character, like the hero Achilles. It gave him this gravitas, but also didn't leave us reeling when seeing \"heroes\" up against a character who's near undefeatable, because we know there's a weakness that the heroes only have to find. It also gave more importance to his recurrence, and the way that his skull would find a way back to his body, kind of like Sauron in Lord of the Rings wanting his ring back, and having this evil relic that's traveling back to it's master to make him whole again and grant him full power.\n\nThis whole removal of this weakness, and binding him to his armor instead goes against that kind of epic tale, and weakens any kind of story or characterization that could have developed from that. After all, if LeBlanc or her cabal once snipped his ties to reality from his armor, what's to say they wouldn't immediately do it again if he deigned to show up again? His defeat at the hands of his betrayers was TOO simple and too easily replicated. It didn't have an epic action nature to it, like previously where someone snuck into the most guarded citadel in Runterran history to steal his bones and flee with them to dispel the wicked warlord. That's an epic adventure tale, not just a mage taking some magical scissors and clipping the ties his soul had to his armor.\n\nRegarding the thoughts about necromancers and the Shadow Isles, I totally understand that. However, old Mordekaiser encapsulated the idea that \"not all necromancy comes from the Isles\" quite well, because it was very established that his arcane knowledge predated the Isles, he was immune to the Mists, and his own magic took absolute authority over the Black Mists, implying his flavor of necromancy operated on a whole other powerful level than what subsisted the undead on the Isles.\nHis placement in the Isles didn't feel out of place, nor did it really feel like he was a pure Shadow Isles champion, because you really got the idea in his old lore that he was using the undead of the Isles to rebuild his armies so he could resume his former conquests, more of a launching point to get himself started with the resources available rather than claiming sole authority on the Isles. The Isles were his MMORPG starting zone, if you will. They were not his end game, and his interest in them pretty much would have ceased once he managed to build a sizable army on the mainland again. I feel like removing him from the Isles dilutes their influence and place in the world a little more, and makes them more of this savage, chaotic wasteland without any purpose. The Isles have felt ignored in terms of the lore lately, with the prominent characters now being Yorick and Maokai, and the few mindless undead we have. They don't really feel like a threatening force in the world without more champions with intellect and sentience there outside of those two, so Mordekaiser's removal from the Isles lore just weakens their narrative place in the world rather significantly, because now they're largely just an ignorable island that Blitzkrieg raids Bilgewater every year.\n\nLastly, I don't particularly like how his bio ended, with him \"building\" some nebulous empire in the spirit realm. To me, that doesn't necessarily serve a purpose to the overarching lore of the game, and doesn't come across as a threat to reality, because really, what good is an army of ghosts going to do when they're not even present in the material realm? Overall, having Mordekaiser's bio end with him out of the picture feels extremely weak, and detracts heavily from him as a believable threat and character. He needs to be active in the world to be understood as a playable character, not currently \"dead\" with his armor being guarded by the Black Rose. The threat of his return in an unknown future is not enough to make him have impact as a character. He needs to BE RETURNED, and ready to conquer again, like he was in his old lore, planning and building his armies on the Isles so he could return to the Bastion.\n\nThese are really the larger weak points I found in his new bio, because his old lore did a really good job in wrapping all of this together and having us believe he was there in the world and ready to rumble.","replies":[{"poster":"DevourerOfHP","date":"2019-05-30T15:42:08.826+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Oleandervine,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=GuvErsoT,comment-id=0007000b,timestamp=2019-05-30T14:17:38.088+0000)\n>\n> Some more feed back, if I may.\n> \n> The necromancer aspect of Mordekaiser in the new lore feels tacked on, or largely nonexistent. We don't really get an impression in his bio that he IS a necromancer or even indulged in that kind of magic as a means to conquer the world. We're just told that he killed some mages who summoned him, then absorbed their souls in his enchanted mace. Here's a paragraph where I believe a bulk of the confusion lies:\n> \n> \"Thus began his second conquest of the mortal realm. As before, his ambitions were great, only now empowered by necromantic sorceries he could never have previously imagined. From the fearful, dissipating souls of the sorcerers, Mordekaiser forged a weapon fit for an emperor of death—his brutal mace, Nightfall—and seized control of the army they had raised.\"\n> \n> It's not immediately clear that Mordekaiser is now using necromancy, because being summoned and bound in armor can qualify as being empowered by necromantic sorceries (whereas previously he was just a human). Additionally, nothing previous to this paragraph explains why and how he suddenly learned necromancy by killing some mages. It's not a proper flow of understanding, because we're not told he learned it in purgatory from the whispers of Ochnun, and it's not established in League lore that you learn the magical trade of sorcerers if you kill them, so the understanding that he may be using necromancy is poorly established, and feels forced in trying to link it to what we understood as a previously un-magical warlord. Even willing yourself to resist fading from the Spirit Realm doesn't immediately grant you necromantic powers either, so overall, it seems really glazed over, whereas his old lore has him firmly established as a necromancer/warlord hybrid who was well learned in both crafts.\n> \n> I also feel that the removal of his mortal weaknesses weakens him as a character, and takes away the mythological nature of him as an entity. Joseph Cambell is one of the leading experts on myth and legend, and I feel like there's a lot to take away from his insight on the human epic, the hero, the villain, and saving the day. Myths and legends persist to this day because of how classic the tales are. Having old Mordekaiser as the villain who's 99% undefeatable unless you disturb his remains was the perfect setting for making him a mythical character, like the hero Achilles. It gave him this gravitas, but also didn't leave us reeling when seeing \"heroes\" up against a character who's near undefeatable, because we know there's a weakness that the heroes only have to find. It also gave more importance to his recurrence, and the way that his skull would find a way back to his body, kind of like Sauron in Lord of the Rings wanting his ring back, and having this evil relic that's traveling back to it's master to make him whole again and grant him full power.\n> \n> This whole removal of this weakness, and binding him to his armor instead goes against that kind of epic tale, and weakens any kind of story or characterization that could have developed from that. After all, if LeBlanc or her cabal once snipped his ties to reality from his armor, what's to say they wouldn't immediately do it again if he deigned to show up again? His defeat at the hands of his betrayers was TOO simple and too easily replicated. It didn't have an epic action nature to it, like previously where someone snuck into the most guarded citadel in Runterran history to steal his bones and flee with them to dispel the wicked warlord. That's an epic adventure tale, not just a mage taking some magical scissors and clipping the ties his soul had to his armor.\n> \n> Regarding the thoughts about necromancers and the Shadow Isles, I totally understand that. However, old Mordekaiser encapsulated the idea that \"not all necromancy comes from the Isles\" quite well, because it was very established that his arcane knowledge predated the Isles, he was immune to the Mists, and his own magic took absolute authority over the Black Mists, implying his flavor of necromancy operated on a whole other powerful level than what subsisted the undead on the Isles.\n> His placement in the Isles didn't feel out of place, nor did it really feel like he was a pure Shadow Isles champion, because you really got the idea in his old lore that he was using the undead of the Isles to rebuild his armies so he could resume his former conquests, more of a launching point to get himself started with the resources available rather than claiming sole authority on the Isles.

While the shadow isles were great for his undead ghost army far far away from everything else.\nAnd it looks really forced to me how they made him so overpowered that his will power is that strong that he in a way beat death itself while being a human...\nBecause of his rage and torment that held him together. Okay, I can say for sure that there are billions of others that died and were enraged and tormented but still faded...\nWhile the Shadow Isles were perfect for him and made much much more sense to his character and plan. It made sense since all of that there happened because of magic and spells and he was once a necromancer so it made sense to why he would stand out in a way. It made sense to how he would control the mist and bound the souls to his will.\nAnd this kinda kicks down Lb a bit. He purposefully let that happen.
