In a vacuum, anyway.\n\nI like her new Q. It&#039;s short ranged, and while the CD is a tad low at level 1 (1.5s) it&#039;s got a steep energy cost, so I think it&#039;s ok.\n\nThen there&#039;s the W. After playing with this, everyone&#039;s fears are justified. This is busted as hell. I can basically assault any champion I want under a tower for at least 5 seconds, because all I need to do is move back into this massive cloud and suddenly the turret can&#039;t see me. This is broken BEYOND all reason, and shouldn&#039;t be in the game. Furthermore, _the duration of the cloud is extended every time you move in or move out of it._ That&#039;s fucking bonkers on something that&#039;s not even an ultimate. So what you get with this shroud is a huge zone of vision where NO enemies can see you, and then on top of that, as you do your hit and runs under the turrets, it&#039;s duration gets extended. Way to go on making a totally balanced ability there Riot. This ability will single handedly ruin mid lane mages or anyone who can&#039;t move fast enough away from her.\n\nThen we have the E. This, too, is utterly busted. I used it, it activates the passive, while simultaneously vaulting you backwards, and then _tripping her passive&#039;s zone you have to cross for the heal attack._ Then, on top of that, you get to leap back to the target you marked, and the leap distance is astronomical, it seems as large as Kai&#039;Sa&#039;s ultimate. This is absolutely disgusting.\n\n**EDIT: I experimented with this more. Put a dummy just near the edge of the enemy turret in mid. Used E on the dummy. Then I used R to dash away from it, and got as far as the allied inner turret (between the outer and inhib) before I had to press E and I dashed back. It was about 2/3rd of the distance of a Sion ultimate. This shit is stupid.**\n\nHer ultimate then, is also horrible. Her first press of the skill vaults her in a distance. It stuns enemies she vaults over for a fraction of a second, think Nautilus&#039; passive. Then her second hit of the button launches her in a direction, dealing more damage and then dealing additional damage based on how low any enemies are, like Evelynn&#039;s ultimate.\n\nWhat we have then, in the new Akali is just pure, unbridled mobility, combined with about every feature that will make her cancer to lane against, and even more cancer to kill or hell, see. This VGU looks good in terms of model, but the kit is so unbelievably busted, I cannot see ANYONE getting to play her for weeks to months because of the sheer power in it. If she has weaknesses, they&#039;re very small, and difficult to exploit. \nI would beseech Riot to take this back to the drawing board. Remove this bullshit &quot;obscuring&quot; from her Shroud, give her a much smaller range to leap to a marked target with her E, and remove the fucking stun from her R. No assassins with this much power should be able to AOE stun, even for small times.","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2018-07-17T23:23:57.664+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":4,"body":"Tooltips and Scalings via [Surrender @ 20](http://www.surrenderat20.net/2018/07/717-pbe-update-akali-update-pool-party.html) ~~(will update with base stats when they get posted)~~:\n\n\n> ##Base Stats:\n> * Base HP: 550\n> * HP Per Level: 85\n> * Energy: 200\n> * HP Regen: 0.7\n> * HP Regen Growth: 0.1\n> * Base MR: 32\n> * MR Per Level: 1.25\n> * Base AD: 64.4\n> * AD per level: 3.3\n> * Base Armor:  23\n> * Armor Growth: ~\n> * Attack Speed: 0.625\n> * Attack Speed Growth:   3.2\n> * Base Move Speed: 345\n> * Attack Range: 125\n\nNot sure if the armor growth is a typo on their site, or if she just doesn't have scaling for that.\n---\n\n> ##Passive: Assassin's Mark\nDealing spell damage to a champion reveals an energy ring around them. \nWhen Akali crosses the ring, she extends her kama and empowers it.

Because I have and some of this is just plain wrong or is massive hyperbole.\n\nFirst off, her passive DOES NOT heal, only her Q does when cast near full energy. Her passive hits deal extra damage, restore a bit of energy, and have an extended auto range that is still pretty small.\n\nSecond: Yes, her W does hide you from turret but you act like it makes you immune. The turret still immediately takes shots at you when you pop out of obscurity to attack or do anything other than move and the shots still hit you when you fade back into the shroud. You can still take a lot of damage from tower if you're fucking around in tower range with W.\n\nAnd her E. It's basically Lee Sin's Q with a backflip attached. Yes, it procs her passive and can carry her very far, but it also has a long cooldown going from 16-11 seconds. It's also a thin skillshot and is blocked by minions.\n\nHer ult has a huge cooldown and puts her in right in the enemy's face. Enough said.\n\nAs for weaknesses, she's still a squishy assassin but now has less healing than before and arguably *less* mobility (moving far with E does not mean she has a ton of mobility...) that's all on long cooldowns. Champs like Lux, TF, Brand, Annie, etc (look at all those immobile mages) are still going to bully her hard in lane if not harder now that she can't just use her targeted R dash with 3 charges to get onto them easily.\n\nNew Akali isn't even close to as busted as you're trying to make her out to be.","replies":[{"poster":"GrReaper96","date":"2018-07-18T03:46:24.790+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"The moment he focused on how her passive heal i called bs","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chaorite","date":"2018-07-18T13:31:10.045+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You explained my point perfectly lmfao","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SuddenAntagonist","date":"2018-07-18T08:54:13.534+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":3,"body":"The moment I read what you said about the W, I knew you were full of shit. Been on the PBE and have played her in several games. You CANNOT hit W and harass under turret. The thing will rip you a new one. Yes, leaving it extends it for about a second, which opens you up to damage from all sources, which unless a skillshot and you dodge it, will connect even once you're invisible again, which also reveals you for a split second, showing which way you're moving in it.\n\nThe E is in no way busted. It is a skillshot with not a large amount of range, that's easy to miss because it's thin, and sends you away from the throw point, meaning, if you miss, you lose out. An interaction you didn't mention is, if it lands in your shroud, you can E to it, which still isn't broken. E is also worthless in terms of damage. It scales with AD, but terribly. It's a small mobility boost, and not even a great one at that unless you're a skillshot god.\n\nQ is short ranged, has a low cooldown, but can only be fired twice before needing to wait a while (3 times if you W immediately after). The heal is on the Q, and only procs if you have nearly full energy when casting it. Nuff said.\n\nThe Ult isn't even broken either. It, in fact, requires decent planning to use. The first cast does a \"mini-stun\" which is basically not worth mentioning as you will not get to take advantage of it anyway. The first cast also scales off of AD terribly and does like no damage. The second cast is where all the damage comes from, scaling with AP and doing %missing hp, approx. 2 seconds after the first cast. Do you know how much can happen in 2 seconds? Not to mention it's a skillshot, so you have to actually land it to deal the damage.\n\nTL;DR: She's fine so far. If anything, she's a high skill champion that is hard to abuse and people need to figure her out still.\n\nThis is my findings after approx. 9 hours of her release on PBE, playing her 4-5 times total.

AD mids will fuck her (btw Yasuo is a cancer matchup for her). Any mid with any amount of waveclear can shove her in and roam/recall however they please, and she cant push back. Armor is the only base stat gripe I have right now.\n\nPassive: Exactly as OP said.\n\nQ: Her Q is so short ranged and it feels bad to use to cs. She gets shoved in every lane and can't cs well under turret. Q sustain helps, but try hitting a player with a brain, considering it's so low ranged.  Be thankful it procs on mininons. The energy cost is also pretty nuts early. Probably the worst ability in her kit as it is now.\n\nW: People overreacted on this. In mid lane, you will miss the shroud blink after using this shroud. It's pretty easy to predict where she is when she first casts it, because no blink. If she uses it aggressively, you will know where she'll be because her kit is super telegraphed. She has to be on top of you to Q. Her E is a risky skillshot that is blocked by minions and by the shroud itself, and her R honestly does not go that far. There's very limited places for her to go in the shroud for her to actually be able to abuse you. Defensively, however, is more scary. The duration is lower, the ms given is lower, and it no longer slows. Also YOU CAN SEE HER UNDER TURRETS AND WITH TRUE SIGHT. You just can't target her, but hey, see how many times you'll get to be under their tower. It's good for playing with turret aggro. It makes people cancel auto attacks, and it helps with outplaying and dodging with E. A good thing is that the clunky delay after casting shroud is gone. The restealth is near instant. All in all, there are clear pros and cons to this shroud. By the way, the cooldown starts when the shroud ends.\n\n\nE: Probably the best ability in her kit. After getting revolver, if you land E, consider the fight won. The problem is landing it. Even if you hit it, it's super telegraphed, so try to bait out cc before taking it. No real complaints about this ability. Think of it like a slower Lee Sin Q on a higher cooldown with less damage. The combos using shroud and E are pretty good, but not worth doing in a 1v1 scenario.\n\nR: I have mixed feelings about this ability, however, I still feel like Akali spikes hard at 6 like she always has. The R is a low-mid ranged skillshot. The possible combos with it are amazing too. The second R is bugged, and if you pass by a minion when casting it, the minion will eat the execute damage, and the champion will take none. Speaking of the execute damage, it's pretty nice. The 3 second delay between dashes is kinda hard to deal with in a high pressure situation, and the amount of time you can hold the second dash is pretty short, especially considering its gonna go on a ridiculously long 120 second cooldown after. Also, trust me, with this and her E, Akali doesn't even need her W to dive you. \n\nIt's only day 1, but as she is now, she can't really mid lane effectively. Levels 1-3 are miserable. You will get harassed, beat up, shoved in, zoned, you name it. If you're against an assassin, they will have more than enough time to visit your bot lane while your struggling under tower. I'm pretty sure her roams aren't bad, but getting there is the problem. She spikes hard at 6, as usual, and again with gunblade, but like old Akali, for her to really get a lead, the enemy has to make some severe mistakes. Of course, jungle intervention is a big deal, and that can have big effects, but Akali mid is still bad otherwise. She has to play near perfectly to do anything mid lane. You have no room for error or you end up useless.\n\n\nNow top lane is a whole different beast, and I'll talk about that in a comment below.","replies":[{"poster":"Somebody Love Me","date":"2018-07-18T10:48:29.047+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Akali top is oppressive as hell.

There's a lot of skill matchups here, but she is definitely much more playable top lane than mid.\n\nStats: Her base stats are justified here. Her low armor makes it so she can actually be somewhat traded with. Her movement speed is kinda noticeable here, especially with her passive. I believe in terms of raw stats, she still gets outdone by most top laners.\n\nPassive: This, plus grasp is stupid. Extended range plus empowered auto, plus the rune triggering makes it so you can't really outtrade her, and extended trades kinda hurt, since she still is good at those.\n\nQ: This ability actually gets annoying if you're melee. She'll heal if full energy, and keep on Q'ing you when you try to cs since it's on a 1.5 second cooldown. The energy cost is high, so you'll want to trade when she's out of energy, right? Well she'll just W, gain her energy back, and Q you again, then passive auto for more energy. Level 1, she can zone you off with this ability alone. \n\nW: Hurts melees as well, since they can't auto her.  If she somehow manages to get you under your turret, she'll be able to bully you there since she instantly restealths.

Just like on live - Walk out of the fucking circle of death. It's not that complicated. You wouldn't stand next to one of Illaoi's tentacles, would you?\n\nE: The return is in line with all kinds of \"return to target\" dashes. LeBlanc can W into a TK ult, be taken across the entire map, then press W again and return. The only difference is that Akali's is targeted to an enemy she hit with something before, while LB just returns to somewhere she already was.\n\nR: A tiny stun isn't much to whine about. The damage looks huge, but that's just when someone's at low health. Like Veigar's ult, it won't do much damage if someone's at full health. We also don't know the maximum duration between dashes, so it could end up being fairly short.","replies":[{"poster":"D357R0Y3R","date":"2018-07-17T23:53:45.358+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":7,"body":"you need to leave and return in W 6 times to extend it to 8 seconds\n\nand everytime you do it, you get a tower shot","replies":[{"poster":"Spicy Rice","date":"2018-07-18T00:56:30.157+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":6,"body":"Unless you have minions in tower range, in which case you basically can sit under someones tower attacking them with no reprecussions","replies":[{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2018-07-18T01:55:10.263+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"You have to time your attacks super well to do that.

In addition, if your under tower and doing that, your tanking a turret shot every time you reveal yourself, and contrary to popular belief, until late game those will hurt, a lot. \n\nHer E isn't really a dash, it's not fast enough, from the distance you described it'll take her at least 5 seconds to reach her target, and not only that but you can see where she's coming from. Morgana Binding, Lux Snare, any CC will stop her during the dash and because of how telegraphed it is, it's pretty easy.\n\nI understand how hard it is to deal with but in the early game(just like current akali) she's pretty weak, poke her out so she can't go in on you, then play safe when she hits 6, also her Kill Pattern takes a lot longer than Evelynn, Talon, Zed or Katarina. You have plenty of time to say, press Exhaust, flash away, dodge her numerous skillshots or kill her by landing yours.\n\nFinally the PBE is not a good judge of whether something is balanced or not, mostly because of the shaky servers and the lack of matchmaking balance, in all likely hood you were placed against someone who was much better than you are, against someone of the same level as you just take the previous advice and adjust your playstyle accordingly.","replies":[{"poster":"Eons3","date":"2018-07-18T03:53:40.543+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dashs are not interrupted by cc outside of knockups/aways.

It's a 11 second cooldown when maxed (and shroud will be maxed last), and it's not like she's invulnerable, you just can't AA her. It's got about as much counterplay as her old shroud, minus the fact that it doesn't reveal her under tower which is just dumb. With that in mind though, literally the whole counterplay to it is to move away from the shroud, she really can't do much if you're not in it/close to it. The removal of her true stealth as well as the removal of turret aggro dropping would make this rework really good, by turning the old obnoxious Akali where you could mash your keyboard randomly and still get easy kills into a slightly less obnoxious Akali that has a LOT more counterplay, and has healthier gameplay patterns both inside of lane and outside of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ionian Vulpix","date":"2018-07-18T03:17:01.611+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You ready for Lethality Akali?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sleepcoma","date":"2018-07-18T00:50:45.345+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"I gotta say she's really fun to play","replies":[{"poster":"WøOxer","date":"2018-07-18T08:23:55.538+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sleepcoma,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fccA93YG,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2018-07-18T00:50:45.345+0000)\n>\n> I gotta say she&#x27;s really fun to play\n\nAnd not fun to play against her.

Also it no longer has a charge system, the TWO dashes have together one cooldown, one that is on current pbe numbers equal lategame to ahri ult and early/mdigame even longer.\nAlso while new w is stronger under a tower it is weaker in general in fights not udner a tower as you no longer slow with it, no longer can dodge skillshots or cross terrain he dash and just holds not as long anymore, so no longer palying hide and seek for an eternity till akalis jungler comes,s he gets energy back or creeps kill you.
