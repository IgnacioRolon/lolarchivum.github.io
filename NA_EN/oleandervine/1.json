He can be an ass sometimes, and I can have disagreements with him, but in nearly ALL scenarios, I will prioritize his side of the story over anyone else's and it would be extremely hard for an outside force  to break our connection.\r\n\r\nSo therefore, who the fuck is Ronas to Kayle that his deeds and his death was enough to shatter a twin bond between Morgana and Kayle? You guys greatly underplayed his role in their lore quite significantly, when he's one of the most pivotal characters in their arc. Some random stranger, even if they're your number one follower and prodigy, would have an EXTREMELY difficult time coming between twins, no matter how diverse their ideals.\r\nYou presented Kayle as compassionate enough towards Morgana's alternate views to work with her in allowing some of the unjust to be redeemed, which tells us that Kayle is very willing to make exceptions for her twin, even if it goes against what her followers believe. So when this random jackass Ronas decides HE wants to take matters into his own hands _and imprison and punish the closest living relative and twin of his deity_, why does Kayle side with him? Is she fucking him? Is he the father of her babies? Is he secretly a half brother from her mother? It takes a lot to break a bond between twins, and you seemed to imply it broke fairly easily over some outsider without Kayle even entertaining her sister's point of view, despite the fact that Kayle KNOWS her followers disagree vehemently with her sister's methods.\r\n\r\nSo you've definitely got some explaining to do here. Having Ronas just be a random name in a the lore isn't going to cut it, not when you're trying to have us believe that he just walked in and broke the bond between the twins like it was nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot LegendLarry","date":"2019-03-08T20:53:01.998+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":4,"body":"This is an excellent point and I think you've provided some possible answers to the surface question of \"who is Ronas and how was it that this particular person, named in the biography, could break the bond between twin sisters\" in your post.\n\nI'm going to take a stab at answering the question behind the question, if that makes sense, which is will there be more stories about Kayle and Morgana that delves further into the events that lead to these two twin sisters going their separate ways on rather bad terms?\n\nThe only answer we can provide right now is potentially.

Ronas’s death and the riot might have led Kayle to believe Morgana left Justice’s path. Especially if Ronas truly did just mean to imprison and Morgana just killed him, which could actually go against the idea of justice, since if she was just imprisoned, she would’ve just been found innocent by Kayle.\n\nI too would like to know more about Ronas’s role before his death, and how he was the final splitting force, but I do appreciate at least one other instance of the starting split with Zeffira.\n\nActually, random thought. Did Kayle know Morgana killed Ronas? I know it says she arrived to find him dead and the city in a riot, at which point Morgana flew up to stop her from destroying the people.

That's the major problem here. The lore doesn't convey this _AT ALL._ And for someone as important as Ronas, and the role he plays in the sisters' division is pretty damn important enough for him to have more back story than \"he was her best follower who tried to kill her sister and died instead.\" In fact, that whole incident is something that should be a focus in the lore, and should have probably been built up in their color stories, instead of just random myths about them judging people. If he is indeed Kayle's crush or lover or whatever he was that she had developed feelings for, we should know that upfront, instead of wondering why this random guy, who by all means is probably another face in the crowd that follows Kayle, is responsible for causing an unrepairable Rift between the twins.","replies":[{"poster":"BoringLittleF","date":"2019-03-08T20:21:09.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Oleandervine,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=5JbvbTHf,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2019-03-08T19:36:43.568+0000)\n>\n> Yeah, but the majority of what you just said is extrapolation and conjecture.
