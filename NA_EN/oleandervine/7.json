I do. And I&#039;m constantly reminded of it to this day, a whopping 3 years later, after her texture update in the Shurima event that launched Azir. These textures _STILL_ show up when Cassiopeia dies in almost every skin she currently has. She turns to stone, falls over, and the moment she strikes the ground and cracks, she reverts to this ancient texture. It&#039;s off putting, irritating, and it&#039;s been a graphical error for 3 years running now. \n\nI get that you might not care a lot about Cassiopeia because she&#039;s not Ahri or Ezreal, but that&#039;s no excuse for this to remain as it is. This seems like it would require some of the simplest work to correct (just replacing the affected model with the new texture, in gray), and yet another year has passed and it&#039;s still a thing. Please fix it. Now that she&#039;s getting a new skin, it would be an utter shame if it was marred by this oversight, and our snake lady deserves better than this.\n\nEdit: Thanks to Weathered below, here's a video of what happens:\nhttps://youtu.be/-mhmmcaloxk","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2017-08-25T18:11:18.030+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":8,"body":"Why would you downvote this?

She's wicked old, and isn't the most... organized. \n\nCass has a couple states - obviously her living form, and then a death. The animation only plays until she falls over, and then the remaining cracking/breaking apart and dust are all VFX in conjunction with a texture file. \n\nGiven that context, a fix is a tad more complex than assumed, BUT, I've been talking to a couple disciplines this morning to see what kind of fix would be needed and the dev work that would be involved. \n\nI don't have a ton of info for ya right now, nor a definitive 'hey, sure, we'll fix it next patch', but it's on our radar and is being tracked in a ticket. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2017-08-29T01:14:49.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome!
