The common solution normally is to switch to Borderless Window while playing, but that doesn't help in my case. The \"No Signal\" error keeps popping up even weather I'm on my main display or a T.V (which seems to cause the problem for some people) It's extremely annoying to have to hold spacebar or left click while watching gameplay when I feel like i shouldn't have to, and I would like to know if anyone else is experiencing this issue or if it's being looked into along with the regular gameplay \"no signal/out of range\" issue, I get that it's not nearly as bad as being unable to play a game as it is to just watch a game, but it's still been making me upset for quite a while.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-19T22:20:29.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder if this has to do with the graphics settings you have in place for spectating. Let's go ahead and reset your config settings really quickly following these steps.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[{"poster":"I Cricket I","date":"2017-10-20T04:41:26.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":":( Nope doesn't seem to help (tired it a few times) but like I said before though, it's not that bad because all i have to do is hold a key/left click while spectating, but it's still a weird problem to have.
