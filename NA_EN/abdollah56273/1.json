Swain planified to seize the throne, so he had to get rid of everything that could prevent him from doing it. Urgot has been sent to Zaun into a trap. Swain was mostly hated by many in Noxus as he came back from Ionia alive, crippled and disgraced by the Noxian failure. So, Swain didn't really betrayed him, he just took some precautions... :p\nIn Swain's story, if you take some hindsight on the situation, Urgot has no political purpose, he's just a threat like any other element under Darkwill's reign. Then, speaking about Urgot wasn't necessary in the events.","replies":[{"poster":"Whyte Lyon","date":"2018-04-05T20:16:12.821+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As much as your opinion is the closest thing to accurate, the actual answer was confirmed by Interlocutioner (Swain & Urgot's writer) as simply because...\n\n> Swain saw Urgot as a fanatic who couldn't be swayed or reasoned with.\n\nBasically the core reason Urgot was exiled was that he's too much of a dogmatic (closed-minded) nut case to keep around.\n\nWhich would make him a liability to the Empire and its new values.

The reason I'm interested in the Swain/Urgot thing is also the contrasting dichotomy of their ideals, Chaos vs Order. I guess I'm biased because Urgot is one of my favorite champions. And despite his appearance and his radical ideas, I love how the VGU team made him undeniably intelligent. And even if his ideas seem violent, you can't help but get swayed by the words he says.\n\nDon't know if that was intentional, or just my own personal interpretation, but Riot did a really good job. And it might just be my personal perception, but I think of Urgot and Swain as equals when it comes to intelligence and ideas. They both have equally valid arguments for their ideas and actions (relative to the political and social realities of Runeterra of course).\n\nBut hey, I'm just rambling.

The important thing is to _have_ a standard, so players know what to expect when they read a piece, and to keep us focused. \n\nWe need that because, we had a tendency to end up telling stories within bios in the past. IT WAS AWESOME. It kept Runeterra and the characters alive. But the question became, why not tell these stories in _actual_ story form—in comics, Principles of Strength, etc. \n\nAs someone who writes bios more often than the longer form stories, I'm with you all in hoping we follow through on that promise, and don't leave these characters hanging. I try really hard within the 600 words allotted to at least _imply_ stories, so you can build them in your head.

Seizing the city would prove a capital, if not absolute, advantage over all the other nations around Runeterra. Assets, technology, production, manpower, money, naval control etc. If Swain did plan this in advance, he flipped a coin, or actually knew how would grew Urgot from this. As a thoughtful man he created \"options\". If Zaun was to be in open conflict with Piltover by some sort of coup led by Urgot, it would in fact give an opportunity for Noxus to take over the city. Whatever would happen from the conflict, chances that it would fail are nearly impossible. The region is under control and both sides would be weakened, then, Noxus simply could do some quick paper work to make Piltover pledge under them, and if they don't want to they wouldn't be able to stop Noxus from taking over the city following the conflict. A masterful plan.\n\nHowever, we must consider that Urgot has... six legs and if he is five steps from realizing that... wait, he would just quickly realize that Swain is ten steps ahead... oh man, poor Urgot, he got played, clear and simple, twice. {{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2018-04-06T02:33:56.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah honestly the demon is such a huge part of swain's identity or whatever now, his source of power and knowledge, it was really weird how little it was explained","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2018-04-06T05:43:14.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I've always seen it as sort of incidental to the rest of him.
