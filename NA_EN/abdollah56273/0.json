On my current EUNE account I've poured money, heart and sweat into it. So it'd be great if I could transfer my account to Garena in Taiwan. If that is not possible, is it possible to transfer my mainland Tencent account to Garena?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-23T21:46:44.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but at the moment it's not possible :(  There have been transfer windows to Garena servers in the past, but usually these sort of transfer windows accompany the launch of new regions.
