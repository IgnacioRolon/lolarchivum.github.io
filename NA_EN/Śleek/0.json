I get some blitzcrank bot saying it has reviewed my ticket and has \"Solved my case\"\r\nhttps://gyazo.com/a3692a7a96bbf17b9f4f4ced8cc4d82f\r\n\r\nIt says to request a human I did this 8 days ago. I completed the survey and I still have not recieved any support from a human or any updates on my ban.\r\nhttps://gyazo.com/3377195173723ef263501c07aea7b383\r\nhttps://gyazo.com/2fa5c6a2a7b387d6b4aeff0defa2c08e\r\n\r\nI can not actually download this game and review what happen because when you're banned it doesn't let you go to recent matches and actually download your recent games because it disconnects you from the friendlist and matchmaking. I was at mid lane at the beggining of the game and my jungler Sejuani is recieving a leash from our top laner at the TOP Side Red Buff. We get invaded and as soon as we are getting invaded I start running to help the sejuani but she dies 2 seconds later. She said to me \"keep farming\" after she died. Then she started to troll the entire game and everytime she purposely trolled me or died by inting she would say \"keep farming\". I hope I get a riot support employee to please review the footage and find that I am not in the wrong. I did not say anything toxic. I even asked the enemy team if it was my fault the sejuani died because I was \"farming\" and the enemy mid laner vouched for me and even says the Sejuani is in the wrong and is clearly trolling the game. This is a false ban in the automated system.

Your chat log probably deserves a chat restriction but you've probably had a 25 game chat restriction already. The system goes from 10-game chat restriction, 25-game chat restriction, 14 day ban, then permaban.\n\nJust a heads up that your account is going to be looked at under a microscope now and your next punishment for anything is permaban. It takes a long time of actually playing to get dropped back down punishment tiers. Not playing an account for months does nothing.\n\nSo you gotta get rid of the arguing and insults. I would try to keep the micromanaging down as you do a metric fuck ton of it and all it does is aggravate people and start fights really.
