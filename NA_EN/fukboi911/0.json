I usually get 200 pg but i have been getting 500-600 ping lately. I thought i might have gotten ddosed or something, i did everything such ing on Na server, which is no problem to me since im adjusted to the delay and feel no problems at playing at that pinas \" ipconfig /renew\" , \"ipconfig /flushdns\" etc etc.. nothing has improved it so far.Also tried disabling firewall changing my dns to \"8.8.8.8\" and \"8.8.4.4\" (google dns).\nAt morning tho like 2 am -9 am i have decent ping(200-230) but then as soon as it hits 1pm the ping rises, I have contacted my ISP they said there is nothing wrong with my net as it gives me 35 ms on http://beta.speedtest.net/run \nI don't have a very good net but i get like 15 mbps Download speed with 10 mbps upload speed.\nplease help me.\nty in advance","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-24T21:48:07.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're ping is ultimately going to be higher because your distance from the NA server is so far.  Changing your DNS can certainly help and there could be some issues to how your ISP is routing to us, but any troubleshooting done can't exceed that distance.  You can run through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide for some additional steps, otherwise, selecting a closer region might help a ton!  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
