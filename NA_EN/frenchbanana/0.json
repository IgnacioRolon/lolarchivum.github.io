I only had time to play 1 game but again, I was really hyped. Right as we get into our game, we get an afk (that didn't buy items or move at all, she just kept dcing and rcing). The remake window never popped up and my friend had to afk so we just wasted 20+ minutes and now we're probably just going to stick to R6","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-18T03:41:32.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds pretty rough, to say the least. There's a pretty good chance that player was legit trying their best to get back in the game, and remakes will only be triggered if the player is AFK for at least 90 seconds before the 3 min mark, and only if first blood had not happened. Despite not being able to remake, it does really suck you were stuck with a leaver, were they ever able to get back in the game and play through? At 13 min with someone still AFK, it might have been a decent idea to surrender and get into a better game, sometimes these things happen unfortunately =(.","replies":[]}]}
