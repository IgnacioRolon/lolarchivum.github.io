You find forcing people to take Demolish just so that a minority can have \"some\" choice (because I bet it will be automatically picked by those who can use it reliably) as an actual improvement?\n\n\"Valuable Demolish\"? Are you joking? Many people complained about this particular set of Minor Runes from Resolve because they considered all the options bad until Boneplate came in and became the real defensive option. People want defensive options when picking Resolve, not some weird mechanics that in the end help a very particular play style/set of champions, without covering even the main users' actual role.\n\nI totally dislike Boneplate since it discourages extended trades (for opponent), but at least offer an option that has a similar role/range of users.","replies":[{"poster":"Iota Theta","date":"2018-10-24T18:53:13.242+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chiming in briefly here.
