Counting Darius separately just because his AoE happens to be a cone seems a bit arbitrary, especially since it's 99.9% of the time NOT used to get vision.\n\nAlso, what do you mean with \"capable of stealth gameplay\"? For instance, I don't see what Annie or Braum or Draven do in that list. Gut feeling is your definition might be a bit too large to be relevant.","replies":[{"poster":"Cheekynorth","date":"2017-09-25T18:27:24.335+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stealth gameplay probably means hiding in bushes.

It should raise the question though, why are there so few cones of vision? \n\nStealth is behavior. It requires a certain mindset. Certain elements in League, like brush and terrain, offer concealment, and are therefore conducive to stealth gameplay. Another example, though I can't find the video, was of a Korean Elise being told the river was warded. Her ally pinged out the exact spot of the ward, and the Elise, understanding the vision system, knew that given its location she could skirt around it, just out of it's sight range. She did just that, remained unseen, and flanked the enemy mid-laner. She was using stealth in the true sense of the word.\n\nStealth gameplay is not possible in every game. There has to be a certain critical mass of mechanics and elements - the game's systems have to be conducive to stealth gameplay. Games like Doom (1997 or 2016) don't have the systems in place to support stealth gameplay, despite a player's best attempts at sneaking up on enemies and using cover / terrain to deny line-of-sight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vouloir Oublier","date":"2017-09-25T20:49:05.477+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah {{champion:99}} E & R and much more","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2017-09-26T08:09:37.137+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Both the infographic and the essay are tremendously good work, and I thank you very much for posting this! I very much agree with what you said: stealth gameplay in League is full of potential, but heavily underdeveloped, and I agree that part of it comes from the MMO design of stealth being implemented purely as invisibility. I also very much agree that vision is similarly not implemented in the most interesting manner: wards are utterly boring, and I feel one of the reasons why there's such a discrepancy across ranked divisions in their usage, and the associated quality of play in the game, isn't so much because people don't know how to use them, as it is that most care so little about them as a gameplay effect that they have to actively remind themselves to ward, as it very much comes across as a chore rather than an interesting activity. \n\nOn top of that, though, champion abilities capable of revealing opponents often do so out of convenience, instead of truly contributing vision or detection as a unique, powerful asset, and this I think has led to a fair degree of (ironically) invisible power, where some effects just happen to have an impact cue or reveal attached, and where champions who would normally comes across as vision providers don't really fulfil that theme (Lux, for example, only reveals with her E and ult). Building upon both stealth and vision systems could add a whole new layer of gameplay what would come particularly in handy when designing and balancing assassins.","replies":[{"poster":"DrugsForRobots","date":"2017-10-17T13:45:02.512+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you.

Riot, on the other hand, seems to limit themselves to thinking of stealth only as a handful of mechanics specific to certain champions. This is why they seem to struggle how to balance or what to do with stealth. As they don't think of stealth gameplay, they aren't implementing enough mechanics or elements or using their systems (like audio) to support stealth gameplay.

Conversely, a stealth hero can make a good decision on their timing to go in when someone isn't paying attention to get the jump on them.
