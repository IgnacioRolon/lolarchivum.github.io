If I try to launch league again, i'm told that an instance is already running and given the option to close it and open a new one or cancel. I've tried both of those, uninstalling and reinstalling via the Hextech Repair Tool, which usually works for most of my problems, i've tried running as administrator and nothing works. Not sure what to do now, help would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-20T02:48:44.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When this page fails to load, it's typically caused by a poor connection to our login servers.
