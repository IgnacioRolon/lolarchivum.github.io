I was quite sure I had syndra, but I wasn't completely sure as I hadn't played her in a while so i thought i shouldn't go to riot support with it. But today I checked the skins market and saw that both Project: Ekko and Ashen Lord Aurelion sol were skins I didn't have, when im completely sure that i had both of those skins, because i played quite some games with my Project: Ekko skin. I have no idea what happened because I got no money or rp back or anything, And this is extremely annoying and frustrating for me, because Project: Ekko was my favorite skin and Ekko is my main. I hope something can be done about this, because im not fussed about champions, but ashen lord aurelion sol and project ekko is almost 20 euro worth of rp in skins and I don't want to lose that.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-22T18:33:48.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you still having this issue, or have you already reached out to our agents in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)?\n\nLet me know, thanks!","replies":[]}]}
