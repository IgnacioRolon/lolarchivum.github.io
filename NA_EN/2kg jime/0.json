So i after trail and error, i found the account has been transferred to Latin America North. So i tried logging into the account, everything is the same, user and pass, but the account is banned, so i can't even transfer regions back to U.S. So i can't post this from my main account, (lordjime). I submitted a support ticket to riot, at 10:45 am today, about 7-8 hours ago, and i haven't heard anything from them. I looked at the email, and none of the links work, also riot is not sending me emails to change my password or anything. I'm kinda at a lack of what to do. The support ticket is (#29819094) i'm not sure if this is to support in LAN or what, but i honestly have no idea what to do. I have never left the US, and been pretty much playing league in the same place for 3 years. This is the first time something like this has happened to me. If there is something i should do, please let me know. -2kg jime. -lordjime","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-11T00:01:26.797+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've pulled up your account and I do see where it looks like it could have been compromised, but rest assured that your account will be protected until we can get it back in the right hands. I do see your support ticket in the queue, so you won't need to worry about getting responses in Spanish! Due to the current amount, it's taking a little bit to work through all the tickets, but rest easy knowing that we'll be able to protect your account until it's safely back in your hands.","replies":[{"poster":"2kG Jime","date":"2017-04-11T00:03:30.643+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much, you just made my day so much better","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-11T01:31:44.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"2kG Jime","date":"2017-04-10T23:16:12.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I finally managed to change my password, note i don't speak or read Spanish in any way.
