These are my opinions, if you disagree you are entitled to your own, so feel free to share your thoughts.\r\n**\r\nI don&#039;t know about you guys but there are some things I hate about League of Legends. To start off, I know it is a team game but, your success is heavily reliant on your team. Often teams that have an early game lead will win the game, especially season 6, you can&#039;t count on every person on your team to do an amazing job, people will die and they will fall behind. This makes it so even if you are doing good by yourself, your team can be doing so bad it won&#039;t even matter, because come mid game the enemy team will group up and assert map pressure, and there is nothing you can do about it.\r\n\r\nAnother thing I hate is the IP system. Sure, Riot gets to place an incentive for buying RP in order to purchase champions faster, but with a game so competitive having a currency that takes a long time to accumulate makes it so a lot of people, unless playing for a long time, have a limited champion pool. If Riot made it so IP gains were a lot larger I think this would really help out some of the newer player base that needs champions to start playing ranked.\r\n\r\nMeta and frequent shifts. Riot is constantly changing their game. Mainly for balancing purposes, which they made the mistake of releasing over powered material in the first place, but also changes that drastically shifts the meta.  This kind of plays in with the whole IP system thing. If a person is trying to get up in ranks they will try to increase their chances of winning by playing whats good. So, if they finally get 6300 IP for a new champion that fits their role and the next week that champion is trash they can&#039;t really do much but deal with playing a low tier champion or just playing normals to save up for a new one. Another thing about metas in League of Legends is that they are too oppressive. For example, s5 they bring a lot of item changes and buffs to tank champions, this enforced a strong tank-only meta. Right now I think it is worse in a sense because there is no_ **one **_ strong class, but more of a plethora of OP champions. Pair this up with the meta in terms of playing the game, it really doesn&#039;t feel that different from game to game and really does feel unfair to any player picking something that isn&#039;t meta. Every game is decided by who picks the OP champions, which are in abundance, and who gets the early lead. Occasionally teams will throw over baron or getting caught out but teams that are ahead usually stay that way.\r\n\r\nLastly I hate the pace of the game. In previous seasons there was plenty of room for both teams to become stronger. But now with longer death timers, early-mid game champions being in favor, and even more emphasis on objectives with the implement of dragon buffs and the rift herald, it truly is a snowball meta, and the early game is practically previous season&#039;s mid game. If Riot wished to keep this fast pace and no-room-for-a-comeback gameplay, they should at least adjust some things. For example, the gold given by killing a minion should be increased to emphasize farming, kills should give less xp and gold, and overall experience gained should be increased, perhaps have some innate mechanic where champions gain xp every second that the game goes on. This would compliment the pace of the game better and would just be overall more enjoyable.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-04-02T19:15:49.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love this game but sometimes I hate it as well.  However I wanted to address my opinion on some things so here we go.\n\nSuccess has always been reliant on your team.  Its a team games so that does make sense.  However after playing a bit on my smurf I have seen that early leads only start really deciding games plat and up.  Anything below and its a usually a slaughter. People on both teams getting caught left and right, the team that's winning swings back and forth after every fight and no one knows how to actually end a game.  I do agree though that it feels harder to come back from games now, but I think that's more a symptom of moral and attitude rather than actual problems. \n\nI actually have the opposite problem.  I have way to much ip that I can't spend.  Like over 75,000 ip.  I think that the current ip rates aren't that bad as long as you don't fall into any noob traps (remember tier 2 runes? I wasted so much before I realized they were shit).  I honestly don't play more that 20-30 champs total and having 2 full rune pages is good enough for most champs. I own 8 but I pretty much only use 4.  I wish they would implement some sort of ip sink.\n\nMeta shifts I don't really mind either.  I still play what I enjoy playing.  I only dislike it when the meta shifts in to something like the cinder hulk meta where one strategy is way to op.  You can climb with pretty much any champion in the game.  Sure some metas it will be easier than others but maining urgot can still get you pretty high.\n\nThat last point I also feel like the game has become faster paced but therein lies the problem.  Look at any of the higher ranked games and you start to get very boring games real fast because everyone knows how to capitalize on mistakes and thus the risk just isn't worth the reward as it could possibly lose you the game.   Lowering champ kill gold/assist and increasing priority on minions would further send the game down the path of do nothing and just farm until your enemy makes a mistake and then win.\n\nJust my 2 cents.","replies":[]}]}
