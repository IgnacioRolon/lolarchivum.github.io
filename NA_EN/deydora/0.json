If there is not a way to increase them, is there another resolution you would recommend me to use to be close to what i was at? unfortunely i have already wiped the Macbook or i would go double check which resolution it was at. \r\n\r\nThank you for your time!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-09T03:48:09.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since League doesn't officially support 4k resolutions quite yet, the highest resolution I'd suggest for now would be 1920x1080. It's a little unfortunate you can't make full use of that monitor with our game right now, but we're still working on getting 4k going!","replies":[]}]}
