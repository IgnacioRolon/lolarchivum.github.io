It sounds like you've done a lot of maintenance on your system (more than most can say; pat yourself on the back!), but you could try out some other simple steps to increase FPS by following the steps [**in this guide**](http://riot.com/2dlHSAF). I myself and other players have found it to be really helpful.\n\nThough it more often manifests as lag, another likely cause is Connection interference affecting your FPS, so make sure you are on a solid Connection by following [**these steps**](http://riot.com/12B7oac) as well. Better safe than sorry! Lemme know if either of these guides help you out; if not I can look for other potential solutions or get you an in depth assist from Tech Support! ^^","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeyTukAarJerbs","date":"2017-07-03T20:25:27.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Cw0Aigz55k&t=143s\n\nWatch this video. it should help you out.
