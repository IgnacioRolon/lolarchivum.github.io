As much I love this game, it has been hard for me to climb and have pleasant games because of other players. Now, I am not an expert and I do sometimes loose my focus and make bad decisions and calls, also I do understand having a bad day and playing the game to relax and forget about the outside world. However, even though I do not have a big problem with feeding and flaming because someone is having a bad day, I do have a problem with players feeding and flaming when they are playing a champion for the first time in ranked queues. \r\nRanked games are supposed to be more serious, and I get it, it is only a game, but when you lose so many game because of a player deciding to pick a champion he never played in his life for the first time and then goes and feeds, now this is what bothers me.\r\n\r\nI am writing this to offer a suggestion.\r\n\r\nHave you ever considered somehow locking champions in ranked games? By this I mean, have you ever considered making a champion unplayable for a player if he or she did not spend some time playing that champion? I think, it would really be beneficial if you were to lock or make a champion unplayable in lower elo, (up to lets say Diamond III or even lower or higher I will let you think about that) if a player did not previously played the champion a few times(2 or 3, again this I live to you) in blind pick before playing that champion in ranked games. I have experienced myself and even saw other streamers complain how someone is playing poorly because he or she picked a champion for the first time in a ranked game. \r\n\r\nWith this adjustment, I believe it will be easier to climb and more enjoyable playing ranked games because there will be no players or very few players that perform poorly because they do not know what to buy from the shop or spend time reading what their spells do. In order for a player to play a champion, he or she would have to go and play one or more games in blind or draft pick so they get to know their champion. This would not only help others climb but will benefit the player as well. Games would have less feeders and the percentage of a player undermining other player would be decreased, maybe for a small amount, but it will be a step towards more enjoyable and more competitive ranked games. \r\n\r\nThank you for your patience and time, I hope I gave you something to think about. Much love and keep up the good work! \r\n\r\nSincerely, proximo","replies":[{"poster":"Fear the Kayn","date":"2018-11-09T08:30:37.445+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't think they'd do it because smurfs would bitch and whine about it, but I think its necessary.","replies":[{"poster":"Vlada Cut","date":"2018-11-09T15:01:58.191+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fear the Kayn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=N9eiMFEI,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-11-09T08:30:37.445+0000)\n>\n> I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d do it because smurfs would bitch and whine about it, but I think its necessary.\n\n_\"It must be done\" - _{{champion:98}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frog goes moo","date":"2018-11-09T14:59:23.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fear the Kayn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=N9eiMFEI,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-11-09T08:30:37.445+0000)\n>\n> I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d do it because smurfs would bitch and whine about it, but I think its necessary.\n\nwouldn't smurfs have to level the account in blind pick and/or normal draft with their main champions?

I have played more than those three, but it is also not uncommon for a lane to have 3 bans thrown at it (i.e. I regularly see zed, yas, and akali banned in one shot). Now if someone plays those three champions exclusively then they are up a creek. Don't get me wrong I too get very frustrated when someone decides to play a champion for the first time in ranked but, for me at least, that is very few and far between. Also those players tend to not flame as much as get flamed for their predicament.","replies":[{"poster":"PichuKanna","date":"2018-11-10T03:04:50.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"going off point... but i hope you don't mean your 3 mains are zed, yasuo, and akali :P","replies":[{"poster":"Hellothiarc","date":"2018-11-13T15:50:29.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, My 3 mains are Jax, Warwick, and Xin.
