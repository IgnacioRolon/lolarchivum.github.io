People are so quick to report even you call them trash one time, this kind of mentality is more toxic than the players flaming them ingame, honestly i rarely report players ( only trolls and feeder or really hard ragers) but everyone else seems to be like a little girl who get their feeling hurt if you tell them they are bad, i cant tell you how many people i have seen who get triggered just because someone else told them they are bad even is they legit are garbage, and just go and report after the game, as if that is gonna make them better players, most of the time people start flaming after someone feeds, i have even seen people get mad because someone told them to play safe and farm undertower. So if you are a lil b***h who cant handle being called bad go play fortnite or something because this game is known to be a &quot;little toxic&quot; and if you cant handle some toxicity then idk what youa re doing here.","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2018-08-20T04:30:56.000+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"a witch hunt is massively persecuting *innocent* people","replies":[{"poster":"PlStopBanningMe","date":"2018-08-20T04:33:32.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":16,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2018-08-20T05:44:48.996+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"After reading your thread, it seems as if you still don't understand what the term means.

Riot bans people for flaming and report threatening, not for reporting.  My guess is that you flamed in game, and were caught and banned, and now you are trying to invent a fake cover story/logic to save face.  Complaining on the forums will not unban the account.
