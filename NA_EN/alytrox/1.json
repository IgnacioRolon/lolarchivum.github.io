His abysmal player base is largely drawn to him only because they like his positional style of play. Were he ever to get a spike in play-rate, you could almost guarantee that it would be due to his numbers being over-tuned. \n\nBut even still, his theme is a galactic dragon, if you were to go in game with no knowledge of that, you'd be able to figure that out just by playing him.\n\nAatrox's theme is about being a commander who inspires blood lust and frenzy in his allies. No where in his kit do you see this sort of thing being expressed. Outside of the fact that he's something of a blood soldier, which credit where it's due, they do deliver on that end.  \n\nYasuo has to do with specifically agility, wind being the theme behind him, hence why two of his abilities are wind based, wind wall and tornadoes, and his other two skills being rapid dashes of mobility, it ties extremely well to his lore, apart from the fact he's overloaded as fuck.  \n\nAnd if we're going to talk about recent champion releases, look at Jhin, he has been by far one of the most popular champions in the months after his release and when you look at why, it's because so many people love how his character delivers on his fantasy of setting up for the perfect kill, right down to his abilities, his VO, and his animations. \n\nLore may not directly influence gameplay, but it gives champions a sense of direction for how to set their game play up and their identity on the battlefield. The lore is often times the driving force for the success behind a champion. \n\nAnd as for being unbalanceable, not really, we've seen all kinds of abilities utilized in this game, a team wide buff within an AoE isn't exactly a game breaking concept never done before. \n\nAs mentioned, Fiora has an AoE heal should the target die or all 4 vitals go off. Sion had life steal for his entire team. Janna has a MS buff in addition to a disengage AoE heal, Galio has a MS buff as well in the form of a trail, Kindred's AoE grants invunerability. Illaoi's offers a stupid high level of a team zone control. And this just off the top of my head. \n\nOur next champion to be released, Kled, has an AoE teamwide MS buff as well. \n\nAnd I find it ironic how you talk about such an ult would be difficult to balance, yet the way Aatrox's kit current is, he simply can not be balanced as his kit is a stat check: either he has better stats then you and he's going to roll over you through his drain tanking, or he doesn't and he's going to get wrecked.
