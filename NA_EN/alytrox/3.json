Every time I try to bring a friend into League, they get turned off by one of these things: not having access to important masteries, not having runes that they need for any given champion, and not having all the champions unlocked. \n\nMaybe it sounds a bit greedy to want all those things, but especially if you've played dota2 before League (wherein all the playable heroes are unlocked when you start) it feels really restricting to have just a few at a time. Playing a game where you don't have the same masteries or as many runes as your counterpart on the enemy team feels really bad as well. These aspects of the game are extremely unfun for new players; absolutely everyone I've invited to play say they'd play more if not for these limitations.","replies":[{"poster":"Faith Breaker","date":"2016-06-10T19:02:24.670+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Riot doesn't want you to have fun, they want you to give them your money.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Toru Itai","date":"2016-06-10T02:23:43.483+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'd like it if i could have 30/0/0 pages again :<...

For them, it won't end up mattering if you have 1.2, 1.6 or 2% LS|SV but they'll still want some for when they eat up a huge wave or they're running away while casting their abilities to peel. Conversely, as I said, their abilities are powerful by themselves but they'll still want to scale them up as much as they reasonably can.","replies":[{"poster":"Yrzen","date":"2016-06-10T15:05:15.950+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"tl;dr: I disagree.\n\nIf you're going to need healing, you want it to be as much as possible, where items are to be considered more efficient for damage than masteries and masteries more efficient for LS/SV than items. Anything short of 5-0 should be \"not enough\", and the damage boost, not having all of its points, would be minor anyway.\n\nWe're kind of splitting hairs here, but anything short of 0-5 is suboptimal. This doesn't just apply to League, but most games, particularly RPGs with a variety of enemies. We could specifically calculate, for example, how much AP at level X with X items and X runes Veigar needs to burst down a Vayne with X items, X runes and X masteries, but that's a pointless analysis imo because of how things can so easily go another way. Therefore, masteries are best when put to extremes, to deal with any situation.\n\nFor the mixed bags, If you want a combo able to finish off targets, you'd invest fully in damage, and if you want healing, you'd invest fully in LF/SV. Trying to get the best of both worlds puts them at a disadvantage both when the optimal mastery is needed and when it isn't. (Not enough points on the mastery that would be better) Masteries (mainly non-keystones) don't hold the same power as items, So barring pure unbridled luck, (getting away with 1 hp, etc.) they can't be used to make a big difference in anything but a champion's primary output.\n\nMaybe I'm not wording this well. Here's another example:\n\nLet's say Veigar does 1000 damage with his ult. with 1% spellvamp, he can heal 10 health.\nOn the other hand, let's pretend the other mastery increases that damage by 1%, and that he can do an extra 10 damage.\n\nObviously, Veigar selects the damage. Every champion should be picking one or the other, because they want one or the other more.\n\nThere are no doubt champions that will want both, but then the same could be argued about Veigar. Even if Veigar builds a rod of ages, he would bother with it if it didn't provide great AP. If you could convert the 500 health into an additional 100 AP, Rod of Ages would suddenly be a hilariously broken item. Even if it only converted into 50 AP, it would render Morellonomicon obsolete for all but the most cdr-desperate mages, who would probably rather just build both items anyway.\n\nEvery champion in the game wants one stat or the other more. There are many champions in the game that will want both, but that's what items are for. One will always be more optimal, and balance out what items provide, thus making it better to go 5-0 in them. Maybe if there were an almost perfect balance between damage and healing already available with items, one could go 2-3 or 1-4 to make the balance perfect, but I don't think such a balance even exists. To even be called perfect, we need to base it off that same Vayne with X items, X runes and X masteries. As I said before, masteries are meant to plan for any situation, so we need to take what the champion will generally need more of and crank it up to 11. Otherwise, there's no point in bothering.\n\nLet's say Veigar needs exactly 1000 mana for anything he would need.\n\nItems can provide 800 or 1300 and masteries can provide up to 100\n\nYou would either take 900 mana with the items and masteries or 1300 and focus masteries elsewhere.\n\nItems and masteries are too imprecise to allow Veigar to ever get around 1000 mana.","replies":[{"poster":"Dengeden","date":"2016-06-11T09:42:25.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"(Thank you for putting so much thought and effort into your reply, I always appreciate that)\n\nBut here's the thing though, say you've got a champion with a low health pool but relative safety thanks to range, mobility and/or innate power. Like I said in the beginning, I only have Dopa's TF as a reliable source for that it works. Still, it makes sense, TF is more about good positioning and constantly smacking people with his cards than OSing people with one combo... but he doesn't usually build for sustained damage either (such a playstyle would encourage that). So why not calculate if he wants .4%|.8%|1.2%|1.6%|2% of the 2-3k minion waves in addition to the 1k damage to champions, 20 health from feast and his health regen? It's not like he'll get to full health with it anyway.\n\nYou're right though that for certain champions, that isn't an option. They'll focus on either maximum survival or maximum burst with no room for calculations. After all, that little bit of extra damage or sustain will add up over the course of the game particularly for a champion that specializes in either.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TheDankasaur","date":"2016-06-10T06:21:56.134+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry, I don't see the point either {{champion:64}}","replies":[]}]}
