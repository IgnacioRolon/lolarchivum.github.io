I've also really enjoyed his Headhunter skin as it provides a cool alternative look for a champion I love. One thing I have noticed about the skin is that it is missing a noise that used to be in the game. The sound I am referring to is the eerie predator-esque howling noise that triggered after Rengar would use his Q with 5 stacks of ferocity (Empowered Q) on a target. The noise begins after Rengar gets the bonus attack speed from hitting the target.\n\nHere is the sound I'm talking about. It's around 1m 30s: http://youtu.be/dPeFK_CFEg0?t=1m30s \n\nAs I recall, the noise went \"MIA\" after Rengar's kit change back in April of 2014. The skin has a few different particles and noises that really complement his predator theme. This sound was one of those noises and I hope my kitty-cat can get it back.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-01-23T17:48:02.261+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the report!
