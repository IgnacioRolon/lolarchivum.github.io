I think that this is rooting back to 6.6 because before that I was playing fine at 60+ fps and now I get an average of 45/50 fps. This problem isn&#039;t huge for now since I keep sounds at a low volume graphics at low/very low but take note that before 6.6 I was completely fine with medium/high settings without shadows. Anyways hope a rioter reads this and feeds it back to the teams trying to work on a fix.\r\n\r\nP.S. Could you put the issue in the client&#039;s implemented service status so that we know that a fix isn&#039;t available yet and people don&#039;t get confused and mad.","replies":[{"poster":"XxGbC0gPRz","date":"2016-04-14T15:09:24.357+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"**UPDATE** no update","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tg8RCCWpor","date":"2016-04-14T14:52:51.125+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes no update","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tg8RCCWpor","date":"2016-04-14T01:58:05.852+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, keep posting demanding an update. \n\nDid you know?
