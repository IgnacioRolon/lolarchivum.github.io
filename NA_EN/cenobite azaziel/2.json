I've said this before in many other places, but he's gone on record multiple times that he hated the Dungeon Finder Tool and Raid Finder Tool in WoW because he viewed these systems as a \"consequence-free group system\". He liked to hide behind the reason that it removed some amount of the social aspect, but it always came back around to him stating that these systems allowed people to quit without real consequence. His preferred way was for you to get a bunch of friends and run things together, since that was the \"spirit\" of the genre and it followed, at least to him, that it was the ideal way to play. He ended up leaving WoW before he could do anything to those systems he hates, but in League he showed up just in time to be an influence.\n\nThis is why DQ currently punishes solo players and rewards those who queue together. He wants us to play League in the \"ideal\" or \"best\" way, and this time around, he can actually institute disincentives to going into Dynamic as a solo player. Of course, in true Ghostcrawler fashion, he's swung the pendulum as hard as he could in the opposite direction, so in some cases even your friends aren't \"good enough\" to queue with (evidenced by many threads of Gold-level people having to choose between playing with their Silver- OR Platinum-level friends, but not both). And, the previously promised SoloQueue, if it ever comes, has already been stated to be void of rewards.\n\nRiot, and Ghostcrawler, don't want Solo players playing their game anymore. They've attached themselves to this fantasy that everyone should be on teams, or clubs, like we're all professional players living in a gaming house while be breathe, eat, and sleep League of Legends.

Sure, we love it when our thoughts are shared with the balance team when it comes to nerfing someone, but they do not balance the game around the idea of the playerbase. \n\nFinal personal opinion, they don't revert nerfs/buffs, because they also change other things around that time as well. Ask any good Sion player, and he'll say that Sion is good, or even great, atm because they've learned how to play with him effectively, despite half the community loops him in with being \"Sejuani'd\". Even Sejuani isn't as bad as people say she is because the people who truly play her, understand what it means to play her, and how to play her effectively. \n\nBut by reverting a nerf/buff, while things have changed in the game, especially has the chance to bring back Old problems. People don't see it that way, because they think that the only buffs there are, are actual numbers to a champion. They don't look at other item nerfs or buffs to help look at other champions, even when those items aren't used on them.\n\nLook at all the tank changes that have gone through. Look at all the Tank Ekkos, Talons, and other abusers that have started using tank items, and tell me that the actual tanks have not benefitted from those changes as well. To revert a nerf when those changes have been put in, only leads to a champion gaining unnecessary power.\n\nI'd also invite you to look over this old Post\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4801581&page=1","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
