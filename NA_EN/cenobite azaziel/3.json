If every mode has a separate solo queue, then there will no longer be teams ganging up on solo players.\n\nHowever, it's completely unfeasible. First, Rito isn't made of money. The amount of money they would have to dump into their servers in order to double their server counts.\n\nWell, it's way too much in short\n\nSecond, the queue times would shoot through the roof for all game modes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-05-21T22:42:13.320+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"sorry but uh... i enjoy winning. so i'm not going to dumbdown my playstyle for the sake of others.","replies":[{"poster":"Cenobite Azaziel","date":"2016-05-22T05:11:39.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Majestic Rossy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=chUO0ETK,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-05-21T22:42:13.320+0000)\n>\n> sorry but uh... i enjoy winning. so i&#x27;m not going to dumbdown my playstyle for the sake of others.\n\nWow. \"Dumbdown my playstyle\" in a urf game.

You seem to need another edge. Since it is your new ranked mode.\n\nTryhardind in urf is like tryharding in an all stars match (all assassins, all adcs, one for all), or trying to out run someone in a charity marathon. \n\"YEAHHH GIT GUD DUDES! YEAHHHGHHH what I won????? \" \n\"Herm... I guess this.... medal?\" \n\nI hope you don't go down the cartman road (Up the Down Steroid reference).\n\nSince you tried to e-dick (\" You suck at the game\" ) I guess you wouldn't mind that my argument is a bigger e-dick. \n\nMy account (I only use this one to post on NA):  http://www.lolking.net/summoner/br/6901184#ranked-stats \n\nYou should put all that tryharding that you do in urf mode in ranked dude. Still in gold I with +200 games?\n\nI guess \"I\" suck at  the game. Being plat last season and gold I ( same elo as you) in this season with just 10 games =/.\nI wonder... If I suck, what you think about yourself. Welp, that's probably why you tryhard in a fun mode.\n","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
