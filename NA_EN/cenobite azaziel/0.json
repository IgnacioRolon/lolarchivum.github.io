From Lyte the designer of dynamic queue. It is a big fat lie.\n\n&quot;One of the things about voice chat is that more often than not, you end up with games where only a few of the players opt into the application, and the rest are still using text. In our analysis, we found that ***text-based communication in games where only some of the teammates were in voice chat***  had up to 126% more racism, sexism, homophobia, and verbal abuse that we all agree have no place in League.\n\nAnd that&#039;s , for you guys, is the current situation of dynamic queue. 4 man premades and a solo punch bag. ***126%*** MORE toxicity.\n\nAnd it gets better: \n\nNot surprisingly, we also saw that players who were using voice chat with strangers received ***47% more reports than your baseline League player***.\n\nAnd that&#039;s the FUTURE of league. 47% more reports.\n\nSadly Lyte left, provably because he could endure the &quot;shove dynamic queues up their a**es&quot; tencent order. \n\nAny red care to answer? Two possible answers: \n1) Riot is lying. Dynamic queue is a cash grab before the game dies.\n2) Lyte was lying when he first posted about voice chat. If that&#039;s the case he should have the chance to defend himself. \n\nProbably this post will be ignored.\nI don't have a reddit acc, if anyone cares to post this here it would be a bless.

When they coded the new champion select they intertwined it with dynamic queue. With the way it is written one cannot exist without the other at this point in time. In order to separate the two it would require entirely rewriting the code for the champion select, the match making formula, and many other smaller things that we wouldn't know about. It would require an immense amount of time, money, and man power. That cost wouldn't be worth it for what is overall a rather insignificant change. But there is a silver lining, they are experimenting now while they are building the new client. With that new client comes a clean slate and an opportunity to improve their ability to respond to community feedback, as well as implement things they've wanted to for a long time but have been held back because of their outdated system.\nMy guess is that with the old client things are written in a way that makes it very difficult for the programmers to go in and change things. If the are smart with the new client they will make it so changes are much more easily made end everything is able to exist individually without the reliance on other parts of the code.

You make massive assumptions with no basis even from the statistics, such as Riot using Dynamic queue as a \"cash grab\" and that the game is dying. Both of those are false so please just shut the hell up.\n2. You claim the first set of statistics are false and made up, then use another set from Riot to make your claim, which doesn't even make sense.","replies":[{"poster":"Eevee In A Jar","date":"2016-07-01T18:50:14.194+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game is kind of dying; there's actual statistics that show this. The stats that Riot gave are propaganda because premades are less likely to report each other thus less frequencies or volumes of reports overall but those who are not part of premades are now prone to bullying, reports, etc just for not being part of the premade. This was the reason why Riot refused to implement Dynamic Queue like system in the past as they said for years but all of a sudden they go back on that word and people are openly being hazed by premades in their own team. Hextech boxes? Gamble style RP money grab? Appealing to casual players who might spend couple of bucks but leave after a few months? C'mon. The signs are all there.","replies":[{"poster":"Cookimonster316","date":"2016-07-01T19:21:28.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think a rioter said on some post (can't remember what post) that the statistics for reports were based on games that had a report in them rather than the amount of reports in a game.","replies":[{"poster":"Eevee In A Jar","date":"2016-07-03T00:48:55.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't referring to amount of reports per game either; I am aware that the stats were based off games that had report in them rather than the quantity in them.
