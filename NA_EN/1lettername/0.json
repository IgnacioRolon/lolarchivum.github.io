He was queuing with viewers of his stream (not being paid to boost). We played about 5-6 games before we all went to bed or to do other stuff. The next day coming home from school, i logged into my account and found it was &quot;permanently suspended.&quot; The account had 0 offenses prior to the ban. Riot refuses to tell me exactly what I was banned for, I&#039;m accused of either scripting or using a 3rd party exploit. I&#039;ve sent in a ticket and replied multiple times trying to get a riot employee to do their job of investigating my account (not just keeping me banned because another employee decided to ban me.) I HAVE NOT SCRIPTED AND I HAVE NOT USED A 3RD PARTY EXPLOIT. I didn&#039;t even climb to my previous elo because i was banned in promos. I need a riot employee or someone who can get a riot employee to get rid of my falsified ban.\r\n\r\nMessage me in game @ &quot;1lettername&quot; if you can help me get unbanned or have information to help me out.\r\nMy banned account name is &quot;kittykittybangme&quot; (give proper investigation on this account if your a riot employee)\r\nThe #1 rammus is willing to vouch for me, message me in game for his username.\r\n(no one in the dynamic queue was banned besides me, probably because i main heimerdinger)\r\n(no one else has, or ever had my login info)","replies":[{"poster":"themachamp","date":"2016-04-28T06:34:47.549+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":6,"body":"good luck working with riot support....or getting anyone to respond lmao.","replies":[{"poster":"shyv","date":"2016-04-28T17:39:54.370+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":4,"body":"hey that's not fair, riot support always responds\n\n4 days later\n\nwith a generic copy pasted response that has nothing to do with your issue\n\nbut they respond :^)","replies":[{"poster":"Fishee666","date":"2016-04-28T23:48:41.539+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wish I could give this 40000 upvotes","replies":[{"poster":"shyv","date":"2016-04-29T02:44:38.493+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"make 40,000 accounts","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Daxterr","date":"2016-04-29T00:35:18.028+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=themachamp,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=f7E9WQx7,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-04-28T06:34:47.549+0000)\n>\n> good luck working with riot support....or getting anyone to respond lmao.\n\nThe support team is very nice don't bad mouth them","replies":[{"poster":"themachamp","date":"2016-04-29T06:09:52.411+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Daxter420,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=f7E9WQx7,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2016-04-29T00:35:18.028+0000)\n>\n> The support team is very nice don&#x27;t bad mouth them\n\nNice has nothing to do with speed and accuracy.
