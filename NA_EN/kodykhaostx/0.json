I'm very friendly and can get along with almost anyone. I have a mic so that is a plus. Please add me. Even if you don't consider yourself a great player I am sure you can teach me something. I have been playing as Ashe to try to get some experience as an ADC. I feel like that is what I will like. So add me, let's win games, let's be friends.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-23T02:48:22.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya Kody!\n\nFirst off- Welcome to League! :)\n\nThere's a lot to learn and tons of champions to choose from, so things can get a bit overwhelming at times, I'm sure. The first thing I recommend doing is giving our [**New Player Guide**](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/new-player-guide) if you haven't already. It goes over some the basics of League and may cover some gameplay features or objectives you hadn't learned about yet.\n\nOther than that, there are some great discussions going on over on our [**Gameplay Boards**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance) and [**Team Recruitment**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment), but you may want to visit these sections after you've played a bit more League.\n\nIf you have any questions about the information I've provided, please don't hesitate to ask!","replies":[]}]}
