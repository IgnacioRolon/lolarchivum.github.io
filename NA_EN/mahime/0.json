There&#039;s no denying that, I was awful. It even got to the point where I got a 14 day ban. But I changed, I really changed, IRL too. I got more friends and was brighter in general. Now two days ago I had some real issues in my life. It&#039;s irrelevant what happened, since you can never know what the others have gone through. That slow driver you were honking at might&#039;ve been crying after losing his son. So anyways, I spent the last two days playing CS:GO and LoL, and drinking. Being drunk and having a bad time, I ended up in a few games where my team started flaming me, or maybe they just intentionally let me die or something. Normally I would&#039;ve just ignored them, but I didn&#039;t think rationally, and instead started raging at them. Now I&#039;m facing a permanent ban message, saying I can never play this game again.\n\nFirst things first; I take full responsibility for this, I know that having a bad day doesn&#039;t justify being toxic to others. **I do  deserve to be punished**, there&#039;s no arguing here. The thing I want to discuss about is the severity of my ban. According to [my op.gg page](http://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=Mahime), I&#039;ve played at least 166 games during the last month (yes, I counted them), during which I haven&#039;t gotten any punishments, not even chat restriction. So I must be at least a decent guy normally, I&#039;ve even gotten some honors from my team! Now I have two bad days, and based on three bad games I get permanently removed from the game. The chatlog is available [here](http://pastebin.com/iz7S24yi) if anyone cares. Few points I&#039;d like to make:\n\n1. I did call someone braindead. That was a response to them flaming me. I did wrong, I would take this back if I could.\n2. I did call someone braindead retard. That was shaco. The champion. _&quot;shaco is fucking braindead retard champ&quot;_\n3. I never insulted anyone personally, never called anyone by racial slurs, no homophobic stuff, no &quot;cancer to your mom&quot;, no &quot;kys&quot;.\n4. I only called people idiots based on the plays they made, or the messages they flamed me with.\n\nSo not having any warning in over a month and 160+ games, being at least a decent guy for all this time, really enjoying the game and even helping teammates, then have a few bad days where I flame people based on the game itself, no stupid racial slurs, and I get permanently banned.\n\nI think this ban was too harsh. I think a 14 day ban would be more than enough to remind me and calm me down. I&#039;d understand if I were spreading around &quot;kys&quot; and &quot;cancer to your mother&quot;, but it was nothing like that, I just got mad over the game after having a bad day in general. I&#039;m not saying what I did was justified, I don&#039;t think flaming is ever justified. But neither is shoplifting, yet you don&#039;t get a lifesentence for it. I just think the system is too harsh as is. Is there any way to contact Riot (other than this and support ticket) and actually discuss of this matter? I know I did wrong and am willing to change, and I don&#039;t think permanent punishment is justified here.\n\nOr maybe I&#039;m just blind to my own mistakes, which is why I&#039;d like to hear a second opinion from you guys...\n\n**Edit:** I just checked my old emails, it was december 26th that I got my 14 day ban. So two months since my last ban, op.gg only shows a month back.","replies":[{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2017-02-23T14:46:56.225+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"You were pretty toxic, yea, you constantly insult people on their plays or over people around.

You can probably imagine how different things would be now if you'd made the changes you recently made back when that first happened.

Even if they make an honest to goodness best effort to be upstanding members of the community, expecting them to nail it perfectly is a *bit* much. This isn't the first time I've seen someone come to this board after having maintained a clean record for 2 months only to have a bad day/week and slip back into old habits.\n\nI think that there needs to be a punishment in between 2-week ban and permaban for those players that are honestly trying to change their ways.","replies":[{"poster":"Felidae77","date":"2017-02-23T20:15:24.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is that humans often tend to leave things to the last moment.
