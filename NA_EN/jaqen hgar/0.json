There, you can submit the Network logs from your match(es) and the log reader will show if you were having ping spikes and packet loss and provide solutions.\n\nYou can also narrow down the source of high latency or packet loss by downloading the WinMTR Network Diagnostic Tool, then use that to run a traceroute (for 5-15 minutes) to your server's IP found on the Network Guide. You can run tracerts and pings manually, but an MTR gets it over a duration which will catch and display intermittent issues easier.\n\nHope that helps! If you still have trouble then just browse the forums in the upper left search bar and you'll find tons of great posts on how to figure out/ fix your problem. \n\nSee you on the rift summoner!
