Indirect changes can be just as impactful, and are often more impactful than direct changes. \r\n\r\nThe reason why Trist wasn&#039;t that good before was because she had an awful midgame. If you could find a way to scale and get your items without the game spiraling out of control then you were golden, but often times, the enemy adc would just pop off on her in the mid game and things would snowball out of control from there. \r\n\r\nCensor completely removes Trist&#039;s weak midgame, giving her on hit damage which scales very well with her Q sterioid, which also pairs nicely with the safety she gets from her kit and her support. Pair that with crit items giving a much earlier powerspike and Warlord giving free lifesteal, and suddenly what was previously Trist&#039;s weakest phase in the game is one of her strongest. \r\n\r\n**tl;dr** A champion doesn&#039;t need direct buffs to become overpowered.","replies":[{"poster":"Ok sure but why","date":"2017-10-10T20:37:18.653+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"A champ doesn't need to be good when the support carries\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2017-10-10T20:52:45.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So nerf Censer considering it's so important to rush that the ADC buys relic shield and it's not just Trist who abuses it. It's pretty much every ADC besides maybe Ezreal.\n\nImagine if they nerfed Trist directly so it's impossible to play her without an ardent support.

Yes, indirect buffs can be impactful, but that doesn't mean a nerf is a viable long term solution.\n\nLike llama said below, people do not generally get balance. There is a reason people at riot have to be experts to do it. Just because some salty people on the boards are upset that the weak for months tristana is finally strong again doesn't mean that they're experts on how to balance an entire game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"waiting for WoW","date":"2017-10-10T19:40:17.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think Trist is OP, personally I think crit is OP right now.
