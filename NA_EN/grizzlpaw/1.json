Specifically, his skin. Take one look at it, and it&#039;s immediately obvious that he&#039;s every bit the Thunderlord that Volibear should have been. His kit was beautifly done, and the skin was implemented in such a nice way. Belching thunder clouds, headbutting a lightning elemental, electric explosions that knock up enemies, conjuring electricly charged terrain. What does Volibear have in comparison?\r\n\r\n A raspy cough that scales with a stat you will never build.\r\n\r\n A slow telegraphed single target cc spell that is impressive in name only. It doesn&#039;t even scale with anything besides levels. Rolling Thunder? More like Rolling Blunder. \r\n\r\nAn attack speed buff which does very little for him for two simple reasons. \r\n\r\n1. **It&#039;s next to meaningless against squishies.** 90% of the time you will attempt to dive them and burst them down with a few autos into your W. If you cannot pull this off, they will simply kite you out and outsustain the pitiful 30 damage you do per AA with their 1 lifesteal item. \r\n\r\n2. **Against tanks it&#039;s basically non existent because Voli does only flat damage.** Armor and MR make his damage output non-existant. Sure it enables him to slap you a few more times with his ult, but an extra 200 odd damage is pretty negligible to a full tank sion. \r\n\r\nA bite that is actually pretty threatening, but a simple Janna shield or summoner heal is enough to remove this threat entirely.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, the feast de resistance. The ult itself. The reason why Ornn warns his team to &quot;Seek Shelter&quot; whenever Volibear is around... His Ult. \r\n\r\nBehold... A whopping 155 damage on hit at rank three!\r\n\r\nWhy is this here? The AoE element to this is negligible at best. It&#039;s already been established that Volibear tickles tanks, so hitting their frontline to proc this isn&#039;t exactly the best way to be useful, especially compared to the enemy Gnar or Sej who can Stun lock your entire team. \r\n\r\nIt helps you bring squishies low just a bit easier so you can execute them with W, but even here it actively works against you because the cast time on this ability stuns you in place and often allows the target to slip away from you. You can attempt to cast it before going in, but anyone with a brain knows that the instant Volibear suppresses himself with this ability, it&#039;s time to slowly meander away to avoid the oh so threatening extra wits end he now has to slowly maul you with. \r\n\r\nHe may be Ornn&#039;s brother, and therefore an immortal demigod, but when you compare the two. One is an impressive, epic, beautifly designed champion with tons of potential. The other... is a simple one dimensional wreck of a champion that has always struggled to find a niche for himself. Even when the meta shifts to favor champions like him, he always finds himself outclassed. A champion like him really has no business being in the same league as Ornn in his current state.","replies":[{"poster":"Nahui","date":"2017-08-17T11:29:36.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do we forget that ornn is being released in 2017 and voli has been around since nearly the beginning? Of course ornn's kit is more thematic. \n\nAnd voli's ult is nothing to snicker at. In a team fight, that damage soars. The attack speed on frenzy is meant to help with that.","replies":[{"poster":"Grizzlpaw","date":"2017-08-17T17:39:11.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm aware of this, i'm merely stating that Ornn's release brings light to how outdated his kit is.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-08-17T07:46:57.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh, he is pretty lackluster and outclassed but you are blowing it way out of proportion. He could use some % healtg damage somewhere, maybe have his roar mark enemies with lightning strikes that cause his autos to do bonus % damage and make his ulti sparks arc to further away targets? Then make his charge a bit faster when chasing enemies.","replies":[{"poster":"Grizzlpaw","date":"2017-08-17T17:37:35.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Admittedly I was using hyperbole to help get my point across. He's always been okay, hell i struggle to think of a time where he was unplayable, but his kit is painfully lackluster. It almost jarring whenever you hear Ornn make a quote about Voli in his VO, when he makes remarks like \"take shelter\". Riot tried to tie him in to a new champion that is very relevant to the lore in freijord, but it feels like it came at the wrong time. Voli hardly feels like a force wrothy of seeking shelter from in his current state. If anything just toss a black shield, or a point blank lux bind in his way and just laugh as you walk away safely.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MoonToonEx","date":"2017-08-17T07:40:42.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's high on their list of reworks IIRC soooo not seeing the point in kicking him right now.","replies":[]}]}
