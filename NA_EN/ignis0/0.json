Not a single one of those games did anyone get reported. Why did no one get reported? Because no one was toxic. Why was no one toxic? Because people are keyboard warriors and can't say half the things they want to say in voice. Even in the games where I had a 0/8 (or something like that) morgana who thought she was front line nobody flamed the guy. Yes, I understand that people can and will still be toxic in voice chat if it's ever implemented into league. But the truth is it won't be as bad as Riot makes it out to be. We can increase communication, synergy, and all the good stuff. Also mic muting would pretty much solve all those spooky toxic kids riot is afraid of.","replies":[{"poster":"Lyte","date":"2015-10-24T20:14:55.589+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ironically, I just answered a question about voice chat on Ask.fm, which is here:\n\n_QUESTION: Are you trying to make the game full PG?

In fact, we're not against offensive language per se. For example, saying \"Fuck I missed that skillshot\" or \"Fuck, that was a bad engage, sorry\" is completely fine and is not punished. You're only punished when you start focusing your language against someone else, for example, \"Fuck you asshole, wtf was that play. Uninstll plz.\" Of course, hate speech, death threats and more severe language is not OK in any context, and that stuff will be punished with pretty much zero tolerance.\n\nWith regards to voice chat, we're not opposed to voice chat. A lot of research suggests that voice chat between friends is an awesome experience, but voice chat with strangers is more hit and miss. These are known problems with voice chat and these issues exist in every game. If we do voice chat, we'd like to try some new features to tackle these problems but right now, all our development teams are focused on other priorities.\n\nTo the OP though, there's a huge difference between 3rd party voice chat and integrated voice chat. Players that already have a voice chat solution installed, **and are willing to add a stranger to their personal voice chat friends list and voice chat in a game** are a very different, self-selected population compared to the general playerbase. In many cases, you could say these players are more likely to **want** to voice chat with others and very few people would do this purposely to yell at someone or be toxic to someone. If we had integrated voice chat, it would be available for **everyone** in the game, which has very different player behaviors.","replies":[{"poster":"SkippyWare","date":"2015-10-24T21:25:40.429+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":4,"body":"thanks for not adding it, as a grill i can confirm the harrasment by using the community event things","replies":[{"poster":"Maj Winters","date":"2015-10-25T23:21:54.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SkippyWare,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=kUgY8BYE,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2015-10-24T21:25:40.429+0000)\n>\n> thanks for not adding it, as a grill i can confirm the harrasment by using the community event things\n\nSorry that you get harassed.

I view voice chat as more something I do with friends when we want to be super tryhard, or just have a pleasant chat while we play League to catch up.\n\nAnd that's without factoring in the \"screaming 12-year-olds\" and related voice chat nightmares. (To ward off the inevitable \"just mute them\" responses: first, muting is a last-ditch response to toxicity, not something that makes it irrelevant, and second, once voice chat becomes a feature, it becomes expected that people will use it, meaning that using the \"mute\" option bears the cost of eliminating a significant share of communication bandwidth.

It's available!\nWhy no keep track of timers? It's in game now!\nWhy didn't you practice that build on <Insert perceived tier of lower play than what you are doing now.

Voice Communication is costly on both aspects and would potentially remove customers.\n\nAfter all of that, then we have the potential abuses to worry about. Harassment of Grill Gamers, Toxicity/verbal abuse that cannot be readily tracked without some severe privacy intrusions, Squeakers ala the COD community, people who don't understand mic etiquette and have their vacuum cleaner going on right next to their mic and destroying your ears.\n\nLots of little problems with the idea of pre-built in Voice ,hell WoW has had it built in for a while and they haven't gotten it right yet as people STILL use things like Teamspeak/Vent/Skype for raids.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Celebrias","date":"2015-10-25T03:49:55.870+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"My friends and I use teamspeak.

It definitely correlates with my opinion of how language should be addressed and it will now be used to win arguments relating to toxicity and what is and is not bannable.

When a player has to use the \"Mute\" feature, the damage has already been done. Your experience is already worse, you are already less likely to play another game, and you already don't enjoy League as much as before. The \"Mute\" feature is a last resort to prevent any further harassment or abuse. Just because a feature like this exists doesn't mean it's OK for players to spew hate speech or be racist or verbally abusive. The vast majority of players in League hate these types of behaviors, and we should respect these players and not tell toxic players it's OK to be dicks just because a \"Mute\" feature exists.\n\nLyte said this a few months ago. \"Just mute them\" is never a solution. Whether it's voice or text, it doesn't matter.\n\nReporting toxic people on voice chat is a huge hurdle as well. Riot would have to listen to an entire recording instead of simply scanning a chat log unless you somehow provided timestamps with your report. Who the hell is going to remember exactly when the Thresh told you to kill yourself? No one I know of provides timestamps with reports right now.\n\nAlso \"a couple of my ranked games\" is a laughably small sample size.\n\nAll this is in addition to the great point Lyte himself brought up, where the type of person who actively seeks out communication with teammates through a third party program are generally the type of people who purposefully will not be toxic; and do not represent the vast majority of League players since I don't know of anyone in a single game of mine that has announced \"Hey guys, here's my skype name. Hit me up.\" in champ select. And I've been around since season 3.","replies":[{"poster":"Celebrias","date":"2015-10-25T04:05:17.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"Just mute them\" is a solution for the **individual**. A war on toxicity is like the War on Drugs. It exists. It's never going away. Riot's community team will never be able to stop more than several million people's toxicity.\n\nWhen I say \"it exists\" I mean it exists in the entire gaming community as a whole. Every single multiplayer game has trolls, manchildren, flamers, and baiters, and generally just people that make whatever game it is less enjoyable for others. **Every single game**. Not just League. This is a battle that cannot be won on a large scale. Little bits and pieces here and there can be banned for whatever offence they have, but actually winning? Not going to happen.\n\nThe only ones who win are the ones who mute the others. They're the ones that are still able to enjoy their game. In the end, that's all that matters. If eventually, that person who was muted gets banned for bad behavior, so be it. It no longer matters to the person who muted them. They're muted and technically no longer exist.\n\nBasically: people need to step up for themselves and learn how to mute people. Sitting on their hands, taking it and saying \"why doesn't Riot do anything about this?!\" is victimizing themselves. Putting all the weight on Riot and Lyte to solve every single issue in their game when they give you the tools to ignore and/or block people that are toxic is just straight up wrong, not to mention *impossible*.\n\nMuting people might not solve the problem at its source, but its source is impossible, **literally impossible** to get to, because it isn't **just** in LoL, it's everywhere.

If you have to mute someone, the damage is done. They've already done something to you to make you mute them. The mute button stops the bleeding, but it doesn't close the wound. Your game experience is already worse, the mute button stops it from being much worse. A mute button is not a strong argument for limiting toxicity because of this.\nUnless you go into a game and immediately mute everyone before they say anything. But then you risk muting teammates use the chat for it's intended use like asking to group or suggesting a lane swap or asking the support to play more aggressive or calling for jungler help.\n>Putting all the weight on Riot and Lyte to solve every single issue in their game when they give you the tools to ignore and/or block people that are toxic is just straight up wrong\n\nJust the same, the mute button's existence doesn't give people free reign to be a dick. Toxicity will forever exist, but that doesn't mean Riot should accept that and  stop making decisions that can reduce that potential toxicity. Not allowing voicechat is one such step. Being able to verbally chat with your teammates is a huge boon, but it has so much potential for nastiness that it's not worth the risks.\n>Muting people might not solve the problem at its source, but its source is impossible, literally impossible to get to, because it isn't just in LoL, it's everywhere.
