I hope this situation will quickly abate, and that it doesnt affect you personally too much.\r\n\r\nThank you for your great work trying to make the game and the community a safer and friendlier place for all of us.

It is unsportmanslike, it ruins the game - but it doesnt affect verbal behaviour. Everybody has bad days, and occasionally one rotten apple will fall from the branch that enjoys simply ruining the experience for others - but this does not mean you can sink to their levels. \n\nRiot encourages their players to show that they are better than those who stick out in a negative way. Their goal is that eventually, everybody will be able to play the game with a positive attitude, regardless of how the match goes. \n\nLike stated in the summoner's code - its better to say nothing if you dont have anything constructive to contribute with.\n\nWith that said, i obviously do not condone with that behaviour. Its simply not as severe as verbal toxicity. A troll or a feeder can ruin one game, two at most if you have extremely poor luck - but verbal abuse can scar someone personally, changing their experience of the game as a whole. A lot of players become scared of the chat, or even of playing at all, due to the amount of abuse the community frequently dishes out. They want to enjoy the **video game**, but they are scared away because some people are unable to accept their level of skill.\n\nWhen you're playing a game for fun, you cant help it if there's somebody better than you, can it? That you lost a fight just because you had an accident and clicked the wrong enemy shouldnt mean the end of the world, should it?\n\nSome people make it seem that way. And they're sure to tell you just that.\n\nFrom personal experience, it can be terrifying and wounding when somebody throws death threats your way just because you wanted to try this neat new champion you just got, Evelynn, in top lane with your friend Nautilus. That three people, players that were supposed to be your allies, gang up on you and abuse the heck out of you because you wanted to have fun, not knowing that much about the game, can be extremely demoralizing.\n\nPerhaps it takes a certain amount of pain and hurt to realize that.

If it really was bad and it did get to you mentally, then mute and report after the game. People say muting isn't a good solution, and I'm not saying you should use it as one, but it's there for a reason. Use it if necessary. Nowadays, I don't care in the slightest if a player tells me I'm absolute dog shit after giving first blood or something. Reasonably speaking, I know I could've played better. I just take their words in the less extreme way as criticism. Maybe it's because I've been bullied for a long time, so I developed thick skin like you say your brother has, but I genuinely don't think simply words are worth perma-banning people's accounts anymore, even if their account has been excessively toxic by their words (unless we talk extremes i.e. death threats and so on). Literally words don't matter, it's the quality of which you play the game (if you're viewing it from a player-to-player perspective).\n\nAnd don't get me wrong, words can hurt, they can tilt you and they can ruin the game (or a particular game) for you, but as you grow in gaming experience, you learn that it's natural to learn to deal with ragers, rude players, inappropriate player bases and so on. It comes with the territory of multiplayer games and coincides with a certain level of maturity. I think it's somewhat of a classic misdirection for people to say, \"If someone says hurtful words to you, make sure to tell someone.\" This may not be a bad decision, but you can do more for yourself personally instead of looking for reliance on other people. First thing martial arts and its' philosophy taught me was that there's no need for any or almost all words to actually hurt you, since you can rest easy knowing that on your best day, you'll be able to play better than the guy who's treating you at this very moment badly. That, and/or they'll likely fall flat on their ass in the future one day due to their behavior.\n\n**My reasoning is this:** Words are (simply put) avoidable. Threats and other possible personal information leaks may not be, since they can possibly be realistically targeting you and may cause harm to you. Forms of gameplay altering actions are not avoidable. That which is possibly not avoidable or isn't avoidable is what should be truly banned or is truly ban-worthy.\n\nI don't think Tyler1 was ban worthy at this point anymore, because he has very impressively (given his previous track record) toned down his toxicity. I don't remember the last time he intentionally fed, trollpicked or done something truly worth reporting in the last month, although I never watched the guy every single day, so he may very well still have. Granted, it's damn well near impossible to change habits instantly, especially one that seems to be built into him as a sort of sore loser attitude that Tyler1 had. However in comparison to his actions around January and February, he's really shown genuine improvement towards not being a complete ass. He's been using his fans as tools to call him out every time he started showing excessive toxic behavior and that did work for a decent amount of time. I don't think he wanted to change his rude ways in the past, but after his whole 'reform' speech, I think he thought to make it a reality, at least over time. If I remember right, his reformed account lasted just over a month before getting banned, which shows some form of improvement already, as his last two accounts didn't even make 2 weeks prior to that one. On top of this, if he was buying accounts, he even stopped that by showing his levelling games for his account(s) afterwards.\n\nI used this example once before, but in comparison to a guy who makes death threats versus a guy who merely tells you that you should quit because you're inexplicably bad at the game, I'd easily be able to tell you which is worse and which is worth banning. I'm assuming this will be a ban that'll be lifted one day, maybe in a year or so after a trial or two, as it's not nearly as bad as people on one side seem to make it. People on the other side seem to brush the actions off, but they'll one day understand the gravity of the situation, and probably come to the same conclusion as I have, that Tyler1's ban will eventually be lifted if he shows that he properly reformed.","replies":[{"poster":"Aldduren","date":"2016-05-05T00:39:17.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly, having toned down your toxicity is not reason enough to forgive his behaviour. That his behaviour has improved from what it used to be does not mean he's not toxic anymore, which is why he was removed from the game. \n\nRegarding the way you put it: saying that \"words are avoidable\" and recommending people to utilize the mute function is half right and half wrong - on one hand, you sadly have to be prepared to use the mute function to preserve your game experience. On the other hand, what other people say in chat is NOT your responsibility - the one comitting the crime is allways responsible for it. People SHOULDNT have to keep their mouse constantly hovering over the mute buttons to feel safe in their game.\n\nSaying that is like claiming the victim of rape is responsible because they didnt dress appropriately. Yes, you CAN take precautions against situations like that - but is it okay that way?\n\nI agree with Riot's argument that instead of having to constantly take precautions against divergents, we should instead be pushing them towards reform on threat of being exiled. It might be harsh, but you reap what you sow.\n\nPlayers that refuse to reform even after being given as many chances as Tyler belong to an extreme minority. This minority is simply so harmful to the general public that exile is the only option left, to spare the innocent majority. It's a matter of protecting those who adhere to society's laws. Toxicity is essentially cyber bullying - and the only reason it's not yet punishable by law is because the chances of a toxic player being able to bully the same person for more than one match is extremely slim. I'm sure you've experienced several bouts with toxic players yourself - if you are capable, try to imagine being forced to play with these people every single game you played, no matter what time?\n\nPlease do not misunderstand my arguments as aggressive ones - i enjoy debating very much, and this interests me a lot.\n\nOne last thing: What you say about words not being bannable is what i find wrong. Having to deal with ragers in gaming is NOT natural - it's the exact opposite. That sort of behaviour is NOT acceptable in real life, and thus it should not be acceptable over the internet either. You might say \"its just a game\", but that's exactly why it shouldnt be allowed. Its a game - most of the players go there to enjoy themselves, perhaps take a break from reality and rest a bit - they should NOT have to deal with the sort of poisonous behaviour that League of Legends has become known for.\n\nRiot has stated their pretty lofty ambitions for the League is for it to become a sport that can last over several generations. If this is to become a possibility, the rules have to be tightened up considerably - showing common sense and behaving like actual people (and not furious animals) is necessary to enable this goal. Why do we have to tolerate this behaviour? We would NEVER tolerate it in person, so why should it be okay in text? That you cant see the other person's face or hear their voice is no excuse. \n\nPersonally, i've allways seen chatting as a sort of mind to mind communication. You do not see what a person looks like, you do not hear the voice they've grown up with - all you see is their thoughts. Perhaps you agree with me - it's a lot easier to communicate through text than it is orally. \n\nThus, abusing someone in text form is much, much worse than doing so verbally. Instead of insulting them for something they have no way of controlling, you insult their personality directly.\n\nNot what they're born as or what they look like  - _but who they are as a person._\n\nBy insulting their personality you insult everything they are - all their thoughts, feelings and memories.\n\n**And that is the greatest crime you can commit to another individual.**","replies":[{"poster":"Omegascithe","date":"2016-05-13T17:55:26.251+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the late reply, I don't browse much on the forums... \n\nAnyways! Yeah that's pretty fair. I'll agree with you then, the rules would have to be tightened up more if League were to be an ongoing game in the esports community in the far future.\n\nI don't know if rape is an equally comparable situation, since I mean it more in the sense where messages aren't forced upon you, whereas rape isn't generally avoidable in the least, but I do understand what you're trying to convey. I don't know if I agree completely with that still, but I guess the behavior would still have to be toned down regardless, in order to better the community as much as possible for future generations. I never disagreed with you 100% there in the first place though. There's a time and a place for everything, and like I said, if the person's simply just annoying, go ahead and mute. If he's actually getting to you mentally by his words and offending you, then mute him for the rest of the game to help keep yourself from tilting more and go ahead and report him after the game.\n\nTo be honest, I never really thought about the thought process of text versus speech. I didn't think about the idea of how one form of communication delivers in comparison to the other, so I'm not 100% on my thoughts about it. I only ever take things seriously though when I physically see the person talking in front of me, and I don't rely very much on people's texts and such. Granted, I am a heavily visual learner, so it may be a link to that. I personally guess that's more based on the type of person to interpret which is worse, in person or in text form.\n\nOnly point you made that I personally completely disagree with is that you don't deal with ragers in real life. That I'd say isn't true. You'll always have at least one person in a workplace, or a family friend, or something of that sort to which you don't get along with due to their behavior or rudeness, without much that you can do to them. It's all too common. Even when it comes to home issues and abuse, those types of things, they're sadly all too common in our world. I think it's something we should get used to, at least to a degree (only to a degree, abuse and those types of things is not something worth living with on a daily basis). What I'm already witnessing (but keeping in mind I'm only 20 years old, so I know for a fact that I am missing some life pieces) is that the Western world is becoming very, almost too open-minded, to the point where even the slightest, normally insignificant things can offend people nowadays. There's got to be a middle ground where you can desensitize yourself from the things around you, as neither the world isn't all that polite and nice, nor will it ever be perfect. Everyone's got to have a certain middle ground where you can handle the certain figurative crap people throw at you and be able to find a method to deal with that which is genuinely deemed intolerable for a person's way of life. That line also should extend into the esports world as well since it's something that will be experienced by the mass majority of the community. \n\nThis is great, I'm enjoying this thread might I add!

I meant people that diverge from society to the point the ragers in league of legends do - throwing death threats, physically and verbally threatening other people and wishing them all sorts of harm and diseases. People like these are extremely rare in real life, because the few that do surface are quickly locked up and taken to treatment. (Or in some countries, mostly outside the western world, silenced for good.)\n\nWe all meet people with anger issues in real life, and usually its something you can overcome. Personally i agree that a certain level of poor behaviour should be tolerable - it's a crucial stage of tolerance to also tolerate those who are different than you. Heck, i grew up with a friend who would get extremely angry and curse a lot when gaming (a habit i sadly picked up after a couple years, that i'm first now recently managing to tone back down). At first it scared me, but i quickly became accustomed to it once i realized it wasnt as big of a deal as i thought it was.\n\nI'm not saying we shouldnt be so intolerant of poor behaviour as to punish ANY deviation - but at the same time i do not want us to become completely desensivized towards it. There's a balance to be found here, though one i personally would prefer to be somewhat one-sided. Anger and frustration are natural reactions to competition, and should be a part of daily life - as long as it's kept below a rather narrow treshold.\n\nI'm struggling to get my point across here. Also, am i writing that word correctly? Desensitivity? Desensivitation?\n\nBack on track, i find this topic heavily related to morals - your opinion all depends on situation, or perhaps who you have in mind.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Earth on Tilt","date":"2016-05-01T17:05:09.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"When you play 20-30 games straight of someone on your team feeding 10+ kills, going afk, or otherwise trolling.

I'm not too familiar with the situation and didn't even know of the person until this incident but from just reading on the boards the person was incredibly toxic... so incredibly toxic that he had 19 chances and still kept going. Supposedly he reformed so he wasn't as bad but was toxic enough to still get banned... Geez.\n\nIt is Riot's fault for playing favoritism and allowing a player so extraordinarily toxic to keep having chances just because he was high rank. Normal players would NEVER EVER EVER be allowed what he was. That is disgusting that our own system and Riot's behavioral team are so screwed up that this is the result. It also says a ton about how much we can trust Riot, Lyte, and the others with handling player behavior and who they are really looking out for (then again a lot of stuff has shown this problem, this is just the smashing your face in with undeniable proof incident).\n\nI'm not confident that they are slowly improving anything because Lyte, himself, is an extremely toxic and hypocritical individual. They refuse to implement basic systems to prevent toxicity such as champ select/post game chat logs, misuse of machine learning, blind pick/chat delay, and it took forever to get the queue to vote for your role (years) when it should have been implemented in S1/S2... and I am barely even touching on the problems here. The favortism issue isn't even new, as it has happened in the past several times. I wish I could say I found this incident disturbing, but it has been disturbing long before this.","replies":[{"poster":"Aldduren","date":"2016-05-05T00:49:01.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, in fact i believe a normal player could keep going with lots and lots more bans than Tyler recieved. The main reason they exiled him from the game and stopped giving him new chances to reform was mainly because of the influence he was making on a huge amount of the playerbase.\n\nYes, he was banned because he was famous. That's exactly why he was a lot more harmful to the community and playerbase than your average toxic player. When people start not only enjoying but picking up his behaviour (which is likely correlated) something has to give.","replies":[{"poster":"Xengre","date":"2016-05-05T03:24:27.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe I have ever heard a case of any other player getting 19 ban passes, in fact it is usually after the first 1-3 that they are perma'd. In order to get 19 that requires them to intentionally waive it in the system, repeatedly, repeatedly, repeatedly, etc. :P It is sad people were enjoying his behavior. :( That said, this should have never been allowed to happen for a famous/high ranked player or a normal anon, yet it was and the reasons as to why weren't an accident but intentional favortism and hypocrisy that was only ended by his being pushed further into the limelight by complaints from various pros and community giving Riot little choice in the matter. It is saddening.","replies":[{"poster":"Aldduren","date":"2016-05-05T08:45:51.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, you misunderstand. But there's the real problem - for an account to be permanently banned, you currently need a minimum of 4 punishments.\n\nIt starts with 10 matches chat restricted. That means you'll have to play at least 10 before recieving your next punishment. Next up is a 25 match chat restriction. That makes a minimum of 35 restricted matches before the next warning/punishment. \n\nNext up is a 14-day ban. Followed by a permaban.\n\nThis guy has been permanently banned 19 times. And most of those bans were on the OLD punishment system. You know how that one worked?\n\nTo give you an indication: I had pretty massive issues controlling my anger starting late season 3 / early season 4.\n\nWhen the new punishment system came into effect, ALL chat and ranked restrictions were removed. At this point, i had a bit less than 1400 - ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED - chat restrictions. I had worked it down from 2 195.\n\nEven with that many chat restrictions, i still didnt get any suspensions. That means this guy must have been so consistently toxic so as to have his chat restrictions IGNORED by the punishment system - being so consistently toxic as to EVEN WITH LIMITED CHAT MESSAGES get himself suspended WHILE already being punished. \n\nOr for all we know, he might have been so bad it escalated right past the chat restrictions to begin with and skipped right to temporary suspensions, eventually ending in permanent ones.\n\nOn the fact Riot created so much publicity around his ban - i believe the reason is how famous he was becoming. More and more people were becoming followers of his stream, so as to frequently mention and compare toxic players to him in the game. (I heard about him ingame about one week before his exile, as an ally said \"you must be a tyler1 fan\" to another flaming teammate.)\n\nRiot had to do this to set an example of him. All his fans and followers thought he was cool for his behaviour, and thus picked up on his habits, which - if you think of it like a virus - would cause the toxic behaviour to spread like the flu.\n\nThus, he was exiled - both to spare the community from his behaviour, and that of his followers - and to give a clear signal that \"This is NOT okay!\".","replies":[{"poster":"Xengre","date":"2016-05-05T20:31:28.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can be banned AS the first punishment depending on action. I believe you are misunderstanding what was shown in this post http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Boqd81O0-upcoming-upgrades-to-chat-restrictions which refers to punishable behavior that is believed to be within bounds of possible reform that is chat related, think time out/grounded. It isn't a set rule and it does not apply at all to severe behavior as it will certainly follow a different route.\n\nAs you indicated, Riot intentionally allowed him to remain despite the fact that he should have been sent packing oh so long ago. I don't think this sends a message that Riot feels \"This is NOT okay!\" when Riot actually allowed it to happen 19x and, even then, it took pro players and the community shoving this into the spot light to get it dealt with. This would be seen more as an \"If you are famous and high ranked you get severe leniency from us at Riot Games, at least until you are too dangerous for us to deal with then you will be our scapegoat.\" It happened with a couple other high ranked/famous and pro players in the past, too. Thus, instead of an example being set it was more of a \"We punished him! See!?!?! We do NOOOOOT ACCEPT that kind of behavior here! Totally! Trust us, we don't allow it! *mutter* Also, please forget how long we let it go on...~ and, personally allow, bypassing our systems intended to stop such behavior\"","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"HazyCloud7","date":"2016-05-01T07:03:11.140+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree with most of what you said, but to be fair there isn't really much they could've done to keep him from playing. Even now he will continue to make new accounts and play, the only difference is that he wont be able to stream anymore because doing so would reveal any new accounts he makes. They could've done this a bit sooner when he began streaming regularly, but I think the reaction still would've been similar. He blew up & gained a big following pretty quickly.

If he circumvents this they can keep banning the new toxic player. It would have kept him from bothering top level players, it would have kept him from the mainstream seeing that he is allowed to repeatedly get away with being hyper toxic, and eventually he may tire out of being extremely limited by runes/character choices. Besides, the same argument would mean that there is no point in banning anyone ever as they can all circumvent ban measures. I am curious if Riot will ever implement some other security functions to prevent toxic players from making new accounts similar to Valve's efforts to deal with Counter Strike.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2016-05-01T15:11:47.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why would they care about internet comments when they know they are doing the right thing?","replies":[{"poster":"Aldduren","date":"2016-05-05T00:50:21.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why would you care about what a toxic player says in-game when you know they're just being aggressive because of the game?\n\nThat's right, you know it doesnt matter but that doesnt stop it from hurting.","replies":[]}]}]}
