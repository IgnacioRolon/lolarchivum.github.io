One thing that is overlooked is that better players would less rewarded with such a change, because correctly identifying and acting upon a mistake of the opponent would draw less benefit than it would otherwise.

That makes no sense, it's unrelated and it does not consider the question of how it effects better players. So:\n\n_How_ does a better player win the game?\nOne way a player can gain an advantage that he can use to turn into a win is to take a favorable trade.  If everything in the game did half damage, he would receive half the benefit.  If a player makes a mistake, and the other player plays well, identifies it and takes a quarter of their health, he would now only receive an eighth for his correct play and the weaker player is less effected by his mistakes.\nIf you take good trades, you would have to be given **twice** as many trades.  If you hit a damaging skill shot, hitting that skill shot only rewards you with **half** the value.  If you try to push someone out, you have to do **twice** the damage.  Actually, more than twice the damage, because the other player effectively has twice as much health and is more able to stay; you only do half damage after all.  It punishes attempts to gain advantages and punishes the player for succeeding at them.\n\nAnd this isn't even getting started.  And we still are not touching on the fact that it would buff and double healing strength, it would double shields strength, it would double mana costs for the same effect, it would double cooldowns for the same effect, it would double time needed generally (good bye early game champions).  Ignite wouldn't be worth taking, you can just Heal through it even with Grievious Wounds.  Speaking of reduction, add all the thirty, forty, fifty five percent damage reductions on top of the global 50% reduction.  What reason would there be for a better player to properly make aggressive plays to gain an advantage to use?  You won't kill anything.   What reason would there be to take anything other than a late game scaling champion and sit in lane and sustain through everything?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2018-01-12T08:06:15.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Half the dmg let's see, well you can't half true dmg nor healing, so bam busted, and people would easily make it back to their fountain/tower alive, and the game would go slower, so in order to make up for it everything has to be weaker/slowmovement/longer lanes/ / good players have to dodge/land skillshots multiple times in order to win. But yeah it would reward the better players/ez champ picks/counters.","replies":[]}]}
