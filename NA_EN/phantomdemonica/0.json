The first time a person leaves they only receive a warning, which they must acknowledge. Then a person needs to show a history of leaving or afking to arrive at the 5 minute penalty. They must then leave more to get the 10 and 20 minute penalties.","replies":[{"poster":"DEANicity","date":"2015-02-13T22:36:25.418+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is great, but it's not that easy for some people. In my case I have an issue once or twice a day while playing, I always come back. Always. \n\nI do not have the money to afford a new computer, I have spent enough money as is on the in game purchases that I have made with Riot. This system is horse shit in every way possible. You are punishing good paying customers, people that do not mean to wrong others in any way, because they have one or two issues a day with their computer. \n\nYou are lumping a bunch of people all in one category in an attempt to make something better. A are lumping me in with the bad apples that actually do leave on purpose and try to ruin the fun of others.\n\nThen I read things like this, \"You are affecting 4 other people, find a resolve to your issue.\" \n\nSo my fun isn't important? I am being punished because of something out of my control in my current situation and I know there are many others like me. \n\nI can complain till I am blue in the face but the fact of the matter is that It really doesn't matter. This is the way so many people work in this world. They look at the situation, they know they have you by the balls, and they ignore it. \n\nI am about to quit this game forever because I am being punished because of people that actually do AFK on a frequent basis. Then I am expected to just be ok with the premise, simply because it affects 4 other people, regardless of why... \n\nI affect one or two games a day, yet I always come back and apologize, I can't help it. \n\nThis system that is in place is hindering my game way more than I am affecting 4 other people. \n\nI've had enough and I'm tired of it. I regret spending hard earned money on this game, If you don't care about me and my experience because you guys want to lump me with the rest of the assholes that do leave on purpose, I will not care about this game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I NEED A MEDAK","date":"2016-07-14T13:17:08.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but what if you dont know it will happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cookie777","date":"2016-03-30T20:01:06.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok this is not cool of you riot.
