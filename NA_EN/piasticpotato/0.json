I downloaded up to patch 7.17 off of a torrent which was 6.5gb and when I ran it it still needed the 1.5gb update, I managed to get it to 1gb (from like 6 hours of it doing the same  thing below) until it slowed down and tells me that it needs to reconnect even though it's connected, everything works fine, YouTube loads perfectly. I waited 10 minutes and it reconnects for me to start all over again taking another 6 hours. As of now I'm trying to download another league of legends patch off of media fire which is 8gb and it'll take a long time because it isn't peer to peer and it's most likely to cancel itself, just like the league patcher does. Is anyone willing to upload their league folder to a torrent site for me to use for download? Because at this rate that's the only thing that seems to be working out for me\r\n\r\nAlso another thing, when I downloaded the fresh league of legends client, closing off the patcher and relaunching it brings me to a repair page, which it doesn't even repair anything and I have to delete the entire rads folder for it to work again","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-01T02:34:50.739+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd be careful of torrent files for the patch and make sure you're scanning those files really well, you never know what other people might attach that could be malicious. I'd really suggest getting the patch through the League client patcher as you've been trying to do, but make a few adjustments like using a wired connection to get a more stable download. \n\nIf it keeps trying to repair and failing, you may want to try starting fresh by deleting the game files. After starting and restarting so many times, some of those game files you have now might be damaged or corrupted in a way that just isn't going to work now. If you can't get the patcher working, use the [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) to run a clean uninstall and reinstall, and make sure you let the patcher download the full patch in one go using a wired connection.","replies":[{"poster":"PIasticPotato","date":"2017-12-01T06:36:29.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"does the same thing, after 400mb it just stops downloading for some reason, everything else works fine. However this time the file size of the league folder is different(it added the 400m?) because before it said 6.9gb everytime it disconnected it and restarted and now it says 7.5gb but the patch still says 1563gb to download so idk","replies":[]},{"poster":"PIasticPotato","date":"2017-12-01T03:26:59.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the reply, all of this was being done on a wired connection, i'll try the repair tool and let you know if anything works, thanks.","replies":[]}]}]}
