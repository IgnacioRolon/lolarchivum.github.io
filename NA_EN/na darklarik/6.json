It really doesn't look like it should be a general type item, more of a niche item if anything. Yet with the type of stats it gives, it became a standard item to get.\n\nImo, what's really overkill is the CDR. It just doesn't really make sense for this item thinking objectively. Sure there is the \"spamming abilities more allows more physical damage,\" but simple autoattacks pull that objective off more reliably than CDR. If The Black Cleaver is supposed to be that armor shredding item, wouldn't it make sense for its CDR to be replaced with Lethality?\n\nWhile sure, it sounds like, \"Well shit, that would just make the tank problem even worse.\" The thing is, most people get {{item:3071}} The Black Cleaver to cap CDR rather than shredding armor. It's really kind of silly when thinking about it. A niche armor shredding item is better used to cap CDR than its intended purpose. Heck proof of this is the fact that {{champion:122}} Darius and {{champion:86}} Garen switched over to {{item:3078}} Trinity Force. They would rather have the CDR and extra damage over that armor shredding lol.\n\nAssassins would definitely still rush this item with either CDR or Lethality since they are simply designed to deal high physical damage with their abilities. However, it wouldn't be that default rush item for fighters unless if they were up against someone that would rush huge armor. Heck, even the loss of CDR on this item doesn't really affect fighters at all given {{item:3161}} Spear of Shojin now exists.\n****\nUnfortunately, It is counterintuitive to increase penetration to help fix this problem, but an alternative is making the armor shredding portion even less significant than it already is. Removing the item altogether is a mistake cause it removes a vital tool to combating tankiness. So how could {{item:3071}} The Black Cleaver possibly become more niche without encroaching on beating squishies? Well isn't it obvious. Build it from {{item:3035}} Last Whisper instead.\n\nHave you ever found it odd that despite being % armor based, both {{item:3071}} The Black Cleaver and {{item:3035}} Last Whisper are completely segregated? Is there really a good reason for it? The benefit of having them segregated is to have the benefit of having both {{item:3035}} Last Whisper and {{item:3071}} The Black Cleaver being built simultaneously. However if you think about it, doesn't that just exacerbate the issue of Assassins instagibbing high armor tanks?\n\nWhen was the last time you saw {{champion:240}} Kled have both {{item:3036}} Lord Dominik's Regards and {{item:3071}} The Black Cleaver? Never? That's right, cause he doesn't really need both. Wouldn't it be neat for {{item:3071}} The Black Cleaver being the fighter's variant of {{item:3035}} Last Whisper while {{item:3036}} Lord Dominik's is the ADC variant? We expect both to slay tanks after all.\n\nIt might seem like {{item:3036}} Lord Dominik's Regards and {{item:3071}} The Black cleaver still would overlap a bit too much. You'd be right to think that, there really isn't a reason to get {{item:3036}} Lord Dominik's Regards if it was just a % penetration boost when {{item:3071}} The Black Cleaver could have % penetration and % shredding simultaneously. So how could this possibly be made into an ADC variant in such a way that it wouldn't be abused too easily by assassins? Well, there is a way that was already implemented, but failed because of what it tried to replace: {{item:3031}} True Damage Infinity Edge.\n****\nRemoving crit chance from {{item:3031}} Infinity Edge was a mistake. How do you remove crit chance from the item that is supposed to make crit chance viable in the first place? Thus it was rightfully reverted. Of course, the fact that it could deal true damage gave it a strong late game element, but to try and replace such a vital early game item wasn't the way to go. Yet what if largely the same effect was transferred to a late game item instead?\n\nImagine if {{item:3036}} Lord Dominik's Regards gained the ability to deal true damage on crits. Not the doubling crit portion and no crit chance. Just the true damage on crits. It's not like you rush {{item:3035}} Last Whisper on ADCs anyways. If not that, increasing the penetration significantly. An AD assassin wouldn't really use this since it doesn't affect their abilities and building {{item:3086}} Zeals instead of {{item:3134}} Serrated Dirks is a bit too much. Maybe on Skirmishers like {{champion:11}} Master Yi and {{champion:157}} Yasuo, but that's normal. Plus they actually have high % penetration already since one deals true damage already while the other has it in the ult. {{champion:23}} Tryndamere is the one with the most benefit, but that's kind of expected.\n\nSince its % armor based, it still doesn't stand a chance against the big burst champions. {{item:3036}} Lord Dominik's Regards still has no health. Also let's not forget that building crit and Lord Dominik's Regards gets in the way of building lifesteal so either ADCs would be squishy or {{item:3036}} Lord Dominik's Regards would be pushed to late game.\n****\nIt just makes too much sense really. Amplifying the necessity of {{item:3035}} Last Whisper is the way to go to make sure these tank shredding items aren't amazing in every single scenario. I'll admit, this does mean overkill on tanks. However, the fact is that squishies would remain largely unaffected for most of the game. This creates the necessary divide of either prioritizing taking down tanks or taking down squishies. Ways to ensure this fact would be to do things like make the crit penetration affect only bonus armor so that the base armor of squishies aren't affected.\n\nBy forcing these items to fit into their intended role, rather than being items you get just for the hell of it, the strength of the items are limited but significant. Thus it becomes situational and isolated, minimizing targets to focus on, easing up macromanagement. Easier management means the situation can be handled and handling the situation better means a more balanced game.","replies":[{"poster":"Asud","date":"2019-06-04T05:41:33.909+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like how much thought you put in this and would absolutely love to discuss some of my ideas with you!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sir Saltarin","date":"2019-06-03T00:26:12.952+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":19,"body":"BCleaver is garbage lmao, why do you think that Darius and Garen have switched to Trinity","replies":[{"poster":"Tahminatrix ","date":"2019-06-03T01:26:19.148+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"Garen and darius both have innate armor shred / ignore and magic damage / true damage ults…\n\nNot to mention trinity synergizes amazingly with their q  / w respectively (that and the attack speed helps darius stack his passive)\n\nIf tanks came back into the meta or their q / w was nerfed then they would 100% go back to black cleaver.\n\n\n\nThe real question is why do YOU think darius and garen switched to trinity -.-\n\n\n Because  {{champion:238}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:141}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:240}} {{champion:14}}{{champion:59}}   are all doing JUST FINE with black cleaver, even against a team full of squishies","replies":[{"poster":"Cotten Eyed Joe","date":"2019-06-03T04:07:47.092+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":8,"body":"Zed - Doesn't benefit from the Attk Speed, Sheen procs or mana.

Champ select and knowing which champion to pick for your team takes skill and is a huge part of the game people gloss over. There's a reason Pro teams hire a coach for their drafts. OP is more referencing the fact that there is just a shit ton of damage in the game and everybody dies (or becomes so low they're useless) within a single skill rotation.\n\n>  I miss when the only thinking I had to do was, 'buy armor.'\n\n You should be able to hard outstat a shitty draft with an armor/mr stacking tank. That's the way the game works, it's the reason we take turns picking champions, and it's the reason we have champions designed _specifically_ to counter AP or AD threats. If you couldn't roll through a full AD team as an armor stacking Rammus, then why would you pick Rammus instead of something more general, like Sejuani?\n\n> So you're asking for a game to be decided by stats rather than proper positioning and mechanical skill.\n\nProper positioning and mechanical skill will still win you a fight even if there's a tanky ball of stats on the enemy team. There's 4 other champions on your team that can make that kitable ball of stats completely useless. You also have the option _not_ to attack this tank specifically designed to eat your damage and to instead position better to hit their carries. Or, you know, draft some other damage so that the AP threat can deal with an armor stacking tank and vice versa. It's almost like there should be some major detriment to allowing a tank to build 6 full items that increase their survivability specifically against the damage you're dealing, _wow who would've thought right?_","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2019-06-02T23:52:20.516+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":9,"body":"Do you have specific examples of this happening without the full-AD team being at twice the kills of the armor-stacking team?","replies":[{"poster":"voidscaler","date":"2019-06-03T15:54:10.405+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"well i used to be a tank player, but i stopped about a year ago because it felt like no matter how ahead i pretty much every team i ever went against would have at least one character that would kill me in 3 seconds despite my 3k health and 300 armour \nif you get that lucky game where the enemy adc falls behind hard or isnt a late game scaler/tank killer (ala jhin) and they dont really have much more then burst mages on the rest of their team \nthen yeah a tank will fucking destroy and be near unkillable \nthe problem is the disparity\na jhin will be trash for killing a full armoured up tank, or a rek sai or kha, but if they have a jinx or darius or wukong, or god forbid a twitch or vayne \nyour armour is litraly pointless as most of their damage just ignores it, or in the case of jinx they do so much damage and move so fast it doesnt matter","replies":[]}]}]}
