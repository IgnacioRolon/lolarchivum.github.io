Not long ago I tried to open a similar one on Reddit, expressing my concern on those smaller Champion Updates and what it may take to their compleition. Stuff like Renekton, who could benefit from some updated Animations (and a recall one) (NOTE: He had some VO added in 2014, but it sounds different from base. Why, I don't know), Fiora, Maokai. Shen here is the Prime example: We see him, he has barely 10 lines, missed chance at interactions with Zed (who will need new interactions too, in return), low number of animations.\n\nI understand that CU needs deadlines and there are bigger projects like Poppy or Taric. I get that it would be impossible to update the number of champions that do need balance, gameplay and/or Visual Updates to their models, either big or low scale. But what worries me is that we have yet to see an update to Renekton who i believe was the first small project in the new Champ Update production plan. Or stuff like, say, Ahri, who has a great kit but her base model looks so... squary. Enter Foxfire or Challenger Ahri, there's so much of a difference.\n\nI don't know guys, I'm pretty sure that a new team should be created for those more... \"Artistic\" reason or low priority stuff that needs so much work (VO, for example. I know it's a lot of languages to get through and it must be hell. Damn, I'd rather not count the number of champions that need new lines truly, it might make anyone afraid lol).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-01-21T23:24:05.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was wondering if they gave him a new VO.
