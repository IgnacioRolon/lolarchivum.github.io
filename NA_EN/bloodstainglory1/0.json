I&#039;ve heard and have attempted to complete it all.\r\nIt just doesn&#039;t do a god damn thing. The match making is stupid and puts me on teams with nothing but feeders.\r\nOr with players that honestly can not take objectives in the order that every single other player does.\r\nI also love getting yasuo on my team, I already know that when he is its a loss due to everyone that plays him trying to be a hero.\r\nNo one carries wards, no one can just farm before team fights or wait for their jungler to aid in the gank.\r\nI love playing this game due to the challenges, But I&#039;ve reached my peak as far as being able to ascend to the next rank.\r\nWhat DO I do?\r\n\r\np.s. I can say so much more about this but i already know the majority of this rant is going to be disregarded and troll information is gunna be shared.\r\nIf you dont have anything encouraging to say or information that I just dont already know. Then please refrain from adding any text to this forum post.","replies":[{"poster":"BLOODSTAINGLORY1","date":"2017-03-12T07:29:50.751+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know it has to do with my mentality.

Its frustrating being the only person who wards/begging your teammates to group. I'm convinced the best time to get out of silver is to start ranked at the beginning of the season.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YokoNomi","date":"2017-03-12T07:02:08.805+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Back when I was sensible enough to even get into silver to begin with, the option and opportunity to hyper carry and disregard team potency felt to be at an all time high. Whether it be as a hard cc based support, or nuclear mid. Either way, growth was rampant back then. The biggest problem with how the game right now, is that League has shed a more immense light on just how snowbally the game has become as of late, and how unfortunate it is on a lot of players. To play a game where it's even more team reliant than before, to fall with your team or push to the finish.\n\nIt's not the game we're use to, but while I do hate how it is now, it's bringing forth something that I don't think has ever actually been the case with ranked. It demands the success of the team.","replies":[{"poster":"BLOODSTAINGLORY1","date":"2017-03-12T08:34:17.010+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"prolly the best piece of advice ive heard in a long time","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-03-12T08:00:54.366+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't bother shotcalling or strategizing in silver. Just play a champion that can kill people ({{champion:161}} {{champion:143}}) and make the plays yourself. If you're not 100% you can pull off whatever you intend to do by yourself, don't. Relying on teammates to do anything in silver is a bad idea because silver teams are the most unreliable there is. Even more than bronze, because in bronze at least there's a certain uniformity to skill levels. But silver is the home to everyone at some point since it's the default MMR for unranked players. So silver teams can be made up by honest-to-god newbies that just reached level 30 or challenger players that just finished leveling up their smurf account.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nate Ze Narwhal","date":"2018-12-02T03:26:05.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"There's something everyone has to understand, and that's probability.  \n\nYes, in silver there are trolls, A LOT of them... however, they are not on your team any more than on the enemies side.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Very Hard Engage","date":"2017-03-12T12:04:50.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"literally anyone can leave silver, its just about choosing to put in the effort to learn more about the game and improve your basic skills such as last hitting, grouping, sieging, flashing, and understanding when to chase vs take an obj.\n\ncan you honestly say you're perfect in all of those areas? no? well improve them!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hexs Fortune","date":"2017-03-12T07:05:40.784+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"Honestly your mentality is the problem here. \n\nIf you really want to climb you need to focus on yourself being as consistently good a player as possible. \n\nDon't waste focus \"educating\" teammates you'll never play with again beyond the current game. \n\nIf you must use chat, say useful things in a neutral manner, such as: \"Drag in 1 min, ward pit\"","replies":[]}]}
