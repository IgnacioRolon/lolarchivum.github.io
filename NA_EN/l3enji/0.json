I think they need to do something to make the passive stronger cause no one ever uses essence reaver , its too weak.","replies":[{"poster":"aushigh16","date":"2015-05-16T13:17:19.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"putting its passive and CDR on a third item to add to the recipe could help its build path be smoother for laners. IMO the main problem is the only reason you have to buy this item is the mana passive. No other (core) item makes you wait to acquire its full potential. Just my two cents, unless your Canadian","replies":[]},{"poster":"Original Quitter","date":"2015-05-12T20:02:42.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not exactly weak it just not really good on most champions.

Pouring all that gold into 10% just doesn't feel as good as a bt or bork (given bork has the same lifesteal, but an active healing and also the extra % health bork dmg heals u as well) It just doesnt feel right for the game. Maybe giving it 15 to 20% cdr as well could be a nice enough change as well for it to be worth getting as opposed to more mana, if it just has an infinite pool of mana, that won't be healthy either.","replies":[]},{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2015-05-12T16:17:49.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're supposed to kill minions/monsters to get your mana back.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Volt Cruelerz","date":"2015-05-12T16:09:38.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was a suggestion a while back that received a mound of up-votes.
