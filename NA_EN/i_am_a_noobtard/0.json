I don&#039;t like the mechanic at all.  It favors some champions hugely over others.  I would say very simply any hero that did damage to a minion when it dies gets a cut of the gold.\r\n\r\nIf a minion would yield 20 gold on death and 2 heroes hit it before it died, they each get 10 gold.  If 3 heroes hit it before it died, they each get 7 gold (round up).  I think this would make a much better balance for heroes that can&#039;t toss powers out just to finish 5 minions at once.\r\n\r\n2) Now the one that probably isn&#039;t obvious for the title is last hitting heroes for a kill.  I&#039;ve actually hated this tactic for a long long time across many games like MMO&#039;s and FPS&#039;s. I believe the person who does the MAJORITY DAMAGE should get credit for the kill.  Not just some guy who saved his power up for the last hit.\r\n\r\nThis would also alleviate people who stupidly save hard hitting powers up literally just to get credit for a kill.  I&#039;ve seen instances where it&#039;s a 2v1 or 3v1 situation and it&#039;s already 100% guaranteed going to be a kill just by auto attacking.  But people toss out their ults just to get the credit for the kill.  How stupid is this.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-08-29T23:47:55.650+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":1,"body":"We feel last hitting's good for the game for a number of reasons, including:\n\n\n**It's an important expression of skill**\n\nLast hitting, when you're by yourself, is relatively straight forward. As soon as you add in enemy players however it becomes a lot more difficult. Last hitting well, while at the same time harassing the enemy when they try to last hit, watching the rest of the map, looking for opportunities to all etc can be really difficult. Shifting from a model where 'last hit = gold' to 'any hit = gold' or 'proximity = gold' removes or reduces a bunch of laning skills we believe are good for LoL. \n\n\n**It drives action**\n\nLast hitting in lane creates moments where at least one champion is vulnerable as they move forwards more than they otherwise would, briefly stand still when they otherwise wouldn't, use mana/CDs to farm instead of saving them or harassing etc. \n\n\n**It offers ways to make champions more distinct**\n\nBecause last hitting's important the tools a champion has to last hit with or interact with other champions as they last hit are particularly important in lane. To look at an example a notable amount of Ezreal's distinctiveness comes from how he interacts with minions in lane. His Q is a safe, cheap tool that makes it easy to pick up some farm from a distance. On the other hand he lacks AOE wave clear apart from his ult, so he can be denied quite a bit of farm if you push him to his tower.","replies":[{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2015-08-30T05:53:54.264+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Im surprised you guys take last hitting so seriously.

If they have 3 more, it's 45, and 4 more assists than kills reaches the bonus cap of 60 extra gold. This bonus cannot be more than the original value of the kill.\n\nI personally think it would be great if some of the assist gold got relocated to the support itemization to balance out the support game where the fed team support is basically another AP carry or a bruiser/tank and the losing team support has to become a warding machine.\n\nSome supports can get up to 80-90% of the teams kills as assists simply by doing very minimal things (shielding/healing/slowing etc.)","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-08-30T07:54:27.428+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"How gold from assists and bonus gold from shutting people on kill streaks down works is something we're planning to look at a bit later this year come the preseason.

That way if you're the \"losing support\" and you and your ADC manage to kill that 0/0/5 Leona, you can actually turn the lane (and the game) around by making skillful plays. This would also force the winning bot lane to play more carefully, because if they were both on a streak (one kill streak and one assist streak) and got double killed and double shut down, they would pretty much completely lose their lead for being stupid about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Hupsis","date":"2015-08-30T12:41:43.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OR they could just increase the money gained from Hunter's Machete as compensation.","replies":[{"poster":"Jesus is Savior","date":"2015-08-30T14:22:23.135+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vonler,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=iU6U7bXV,comment-id=0002000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-08-30T12:41:43.358+0000)\n>\n> OR they could just increase the money gained from Hunter's Machete as compensation.\n\nAnd then I steal all the kills, and I become broken while making my team useless.\n\nNo, they're not going to do that.","replies":[{"poster":"Velrex","date":"2015-08-31T11:20:06.564+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or they could just make hunter's machete give more gold on assists, akin to a support's new possible item thing.

So i'll make this question short and sweet. \n\nYou didn't explain why last hitting champions was also important. It feels counter intuitive and encourages pause of action in the midst of a fight to ensure the carry gets the last hit. Supports need to stop \"supporting\" and carries need to pause attacking to snipe kills essentially. It also feels like you are rewarding bad players when you allow players that fell behind to be \"fed\" gold by just being there at just the fringes or the very  end of a fight to get last hits when their teammates did all the work/damage. \n\nWhile I think dealing a killing blow should earn a bonus reward, I don't feel like it should be rewarded as much as actually dealing the most damage in the fight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2015-08-30T16:26:55.884+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't you think that the bar for last hitting might be a little high during the laning phase?\n\n>Shifting from a model where 'last hit = gold' to 'any hit = gold' or 'proximity = gold' removes or reduces a bunch of laning skills we believe are good for LoL. \n\nThe only problem some people have with this is if you give up a kill or two in certain matchups, you can't farm at all.  That means walking out of the laning phase 0-2-0 with 50 CS with the person you were going against is  2-0-0 with 90.  You can rarely come back from that.  In turn if you have a bad start, the rest of the game is an exercise in frustration as your teammates are constantly complaining about how much you suck.\n\nSo, a good skill for players to have means lots of toxicity when you get out played.\n\nThen there's supports who riot always treats like the redheaded step child in discussions of getting gold.

The longer the minion goes without dying, the less gold is earned from the mark. (Maybe 40% gold at the start, and 10% gold at the end?)\n\nPossible: Only the mark from the last champion to hit the minion counts for \"who gets gold\" purposes.\n\nSo Ezreal--especially if that Ezreal was a newbie--would still be able to get *something* besides soaking XP at his tower, but he probably still wouldn't be able to get nearly as much gold out of the wave as he would normally.\n\nIt's a change that would still alter the economics of laning, but less so than completely replacing CSing mechanics.\n\nWhat do you think of that?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-08-31T08:28:30.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The biggest problems with last hitting is that it really drives melee vs ranged matches into the favor of ranged champions especially early game where the melee champions will lose gold/last hits or eat a lot of poke and harass\nMelee champions often have to go all in to have the possibility to trade with or beat ranged champions however this is often really difficult early game as minions are rather strong early game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kobold","date":"2015-08-30T10:06:17.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is an honest question.

In the scenario of stronger minions, you would still push in on Ez, to damage tower, and he would still struggle with wave clear.\n\nWaveclear WOULD be more valuable with stronger minions, and it is already a bit too valuable in current iteration of league, and I don't think LoL would be more interesting without last hitting, it's too far into the lifetime of the game and as it's one of the basic systems of league EVERYTHING on top of it, would have to be reworked.\n\ntl;dr; No last hitting is an interesting concept for a moba, but not feasible to do with LoL at this point, which is too based on last hitting as a mechanic.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Keon Kamori","date":"2015-08-29T23:10:33.384+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"TLDR Go play Smite.\n\nThe last hitting mechanic is crucial to this game's stake in the competitive genre.

I&#039;ve actually hated this tactic for a long long time across many games like MMO&#039;s and FPS&#039;s. I believe the person who does the MAJORITY DAMAGE should get credit for the kill.  Not just some guy who saved his power up for the last hit.\n> \n> This would also alleviate people who stupidly save hard hitting powers up literally just to get credit for a kill.  I&#039;ve seen instances where it&#039;s a 2v1 or 3v1 situation and it&#039;s already 100% guaranteed going to be a kill just by auto attacking.  But people toss out their ults just to get the credit for the kill.  How stupid is this.\n\nI actually think this is one of the CORE reasons why I got bored of heros of the storm after about a month of playing - it simply doesn't have enough things to keep me interested. You go into the game, not having to worry about gold/exp[last hit] and all you have to worry about is trading/fighting with the enemy heros or shoving waves to towers as fast as you can, repeat that for the start of every game, the game gets dull, very, very fast. \n\nWhereas last hitting in lane makes it very interesting and fun, because there are a ton of things you can do during the lane phase to get an edge on your lane opponent, some people ignore the cs and just all ins you level 2/3 to kill you repeatedly, others let you push in the wave a bit, freeze it near tower and safely last hit.........I think you just gotta get good with last hit, since games like heros of the storm that takes out alot of the mechanics commonly found in league/dota becomes very boring very fast","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maikal","date":"2015-08-30T01:01:55.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your thread should be changed to: \"I don't like people kill stealing, stealing cs, or missing cs just because of my crappy auto attack animation/mistiming it rather than actually being denied it.\" No one likes any of those things.
