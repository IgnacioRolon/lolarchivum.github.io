People who refuse to surrender when you've had an afk most if not all of the game are the worst human beings.  I'll admit that the games I've won that were 4 vs 5 felt good, but generally in games like that we were never down so we never surrendered.  I get people that refuse to surrender a 4 vs 5 with a yi and trynd that are just gonna farm and split push and knock off a tower here and there all game.  So I end up stuck in a 35 minute war of attrition that i'm pretty much guaranteed to lose rather than in a new game I actually have a decent chance at winning.  You know how it feels to be a support and have the best score on your team?  Not because you are doing so good, but because they are doing so bad?  Yet these people who are 1/9 2/8 3/11 etc will refuse to surrender and hold you hostage in a game that's a lost cause, all while flaming each other as they sit with a grey screen waiting to respawn every 2 or 3 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2015-10-31T02:05:19.642+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"rather than give up try to get along","replies":[{"poster":"Clown Apocalypse","date":"2015-10-31T02:22:39.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"7 billion people on this planet.

Don't go in expecting ANYTHING out of COMPLETE strangers you're matched with RANDOMLY. Just play like you're their to pawn solo, and make the best of it. If your team coordinates, great, but you can't keep harassing them when they don't do what you want, from strategy to surrender, because \"we just didn't gel, and I claim to hate this game under those circumstances, even though that describes almost every match in League.\"\n\nIf you're using the surrender button as a way to cycle through teammates 'til you find the ones you fit with, like some secondary champ-select dodge every 20 minutes, you're doing it wrong. Please scope out your team DURING champ select and dodge there. I'll take a longer matchmaking queue over 20 minutes pretending I'm actually playing a round. Enough games are wasted BECAUSE of surrender as are supposedly gained from surrender. I'd rather play a tough but thorough, full match than 2 short-lived halfass ones that don't even count. And yes, you DO learn more when it's tough than when it's easy. Maybe more people would quit making crap-calls in late-game if they didn't think the way to better skills is spamming laning phases into quits until you get to the occasional easy midgame.","replies":[{"poster":"Clown Apocalypse","date":"2015-10-31T06:38:54.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"wtf are you even talking about?  It's not about cycling through teammates to find ones I fit with.  It's about not wasting time with people i'm realistically biting my tongue for in a match we aren't going to win.  Even if you mute the whole team, even if you aren't even participating in the argument, you don't control 4 other people and you can't just magically un-tilt your team and make them play better.  When that top laner dies 3 times and decides he's gonna start feeding now cuz the jungler won't camp his lane.....yeah surrender.  Once he starts running up the lane dying over and over I'm done playing.  I wont afk but I'm just going through the motions at that point.  That shit sucks all the fun out of the game and makes you want it over as fast as possible. \n\n I don't care what type of matches you like to play.  When I log in to my account you aren't playing it.  I don't want easy games.  I have no problem with losing.  I just don't wanna play an hour long bot game which is what it essentially becomes once I have to mute everyone and I'm irritated.  YOU don't have to ever surrender.  Taking the button away won't stop people from surrendering cuz once someone has given up there's usually no changing that.  What it will do is create more trolls who are pissed and take that anger right into the next game and spread it.   it's bad enough that 3 out of 5 people wanting the game to be over isn't enough.  Nothing like that feeding duo bot lane that thinks they can come back from anything that has already ruined the game for the other 3 people, but wont surrender.\n\nTLDR?  If you don't wanna surrender don't.  Some teams are so irritating I'd rather take the loss than play another minute with them.  I decide who and what I waste my time on, and once I disengage myself mentally from the game I might as well be afk even tho i'm not.

The rest is a bunch of sweeping generalizations that have absolutely nothing to do with the specific instances that I can recall that have me spamming /ff.  Followed by the usual spiel about how rare feeders, or afkers, or trolls really are and I'm just remembering it in greater frequency than it happens.  Total B.S.  IN 20 games last week I had 8 afk's.  That's not me remembering in greater frequency, that was me counting them in my match history.  Guess how many of those 4 vs 5's my teams tried to drag out?  All of them.  How many did I win?  None of them.  Should I have expected to win them?  No, of course not.  So why not surrender?\n\nIts funny you speak of empathy yet no consideration is given to the person who is no longer enjoying themselves and wants it to be over.  Which is a totally hypocritical argument and why you cant taken seriously.  You refuse to surrender out of some personal ethos to never give up.  That's fine...do what you do.  I surrender out of efficiency.  Infinite LP to lose and gain.  Only 24 hours in a day.  Simple math says its better to lose fast if I'm going to lose at all.
