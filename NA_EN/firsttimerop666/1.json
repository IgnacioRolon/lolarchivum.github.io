FirstTimer's point is: if you want to talk about averages, they better not be calculated from wide distributions. An average time of 20 minutes is meaningless if you only have 20 minutes tops. The OP NEEDS a guaranteed constant time of 20 minutes or less.\n\nBarring that, yes, his queue time claims are weird. Usually it's like a minute or two for both 3s and Dom. But I have on occasion seen HUGE queue times for Dominion at offball hours. Maybe he just queues at those times.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2015-10-26T14:56:49.274+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yea again, all they can do is estimate the average time, so again we already HAVE modes that are meant for shorter amounts of time.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-10-26T19:00:27.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Unless they create a mode where the game ends at precisely 20 minutes and scores are tallied.
