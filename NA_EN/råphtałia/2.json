The recall plays up until she comes out of the water to eat the frog but then she resumes being burrowed. I&#039;m sad! :c","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-06-26T21:44:24.806+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Star Senpai, \n\nWhen she's burrowed, there shouldn't be a recall animation - this is the same across all skins, and her base.\n\nIf you have something that shortens recall - Phasewalker Mastery, Baron, the full recall won't play if she's un-burrowed.\n\nEDIT: Animator says this may have broken  for the un-burrowed state - it was originally set up to play regardless. We're looking into it!
