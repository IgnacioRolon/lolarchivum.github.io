I think once Riot added the lootbox system, they abolished the bonus RP events. I haven't heard of any sales like that in a while. I could imagine it's to keep people from holding back purchases for new content _exclusive to lootboxes _ in hopes that they'd save money down the line. Or in short, to keep the integrity of the lootbox system and its value. ----Just my personal conspiracy thoughts.","replies":[]}]}
