I opened my first chest and got an Imperial Lux skin shard, but I have no idea what I should do with it. I can't upgrade it into a 'skin permanent'- and I don't even know what a skin permanent is. Should I disenchant it, or re-roll into permanent? I know what disenchanting does, but I'm so confused on the rerolling and other options. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nI also don't know if I posted this in the right section, so sorry if I messed up with that","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-17T22:55:18.349+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Contents in a chest include shards like that, which can be used to either disenchant for materials or unlocked if you have enough of a certain material.  You don't currently have the Champion Lux unlocked.  If you decide to unlock that skin shard, the skin will become unlocked on your account.   You just won't be able to use it until you unlock Lux too.  \n\nYou can also hold on to it and use it later for a reroll, unlock it and wait until you own Lux, or disenchant it.  It's all up to you!

I get the general idea of crafting better than before, but I have one last question- you said that I could unlock the skin if I have enough of a certain material; what is this material, and where can I get it? I have enough essence that I should technically be able to upgrade the shard to permanent (which I assume means unlock), but the option still isn't available for me, so obviously I'm missing something.\n\nThanks again for the help :)","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2017-02-17T23:10:06.371+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The material mentioned was champion essence aka the 675 orange stuff it would take to \"**Upgrade** to Skin Permanent\"\nYou can get champion essence from taking a skin shard and selecting \"**Disenchant** into essence\" (in this case you would get 325 orange essence)\n\nI strongly recommend NEVER using the rental option (\"**Activate **rental for 7 days (consumes shard)\") and saving your shards until you have a shard for a skin you want and enough other shards to disenchant into enough essence to **Upgrade** it into a skin permanent.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-17T23:07:14.719+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My bad, you can't actually unlock the skin without owning the champion first.  In this case, you have \"Activate Champion\" instead.  If you already owned Lux then that option would not have been made available.  Skin shards require orange essences to unlock.  If you unlock Lux then the option to unlock skin permanent will become selectable.  Let me know if that clears things up; sorry for the confusion.  :D","replies":[{"poster":"Evalanii","date":"2017-02-17T23:30:03.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for clearing things up, your help is really appreciated. I'll leave the shard how it is now, unless I need the essences from it in the future. Maybe I'll end up buying lux at some point and using the skin, who knows! Thanks again :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
