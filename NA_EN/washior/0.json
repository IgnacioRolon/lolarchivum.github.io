Opinion on this?","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"note : if you really plan on reading all of this to give me your opinion, thank you, it kind of matters to me right now.\n\n\n\nI've seen many players after doing some research asking people for their opinions about their permabanns. And I decided that I wanted to know what you guys thought about mine. I was permabanned. but before getting into that I'll say it now, because I've sent a ticket and im still waiting for an answer, they said something that made no sense. that i was permabanned followed by many severe punishments. \n\nSo far, ive been banned twice if I dont count this one in my entire playtime on league. my first time was in 2014. And I was literally a kid. I got a 2 week bann after a rengar was having an big ego cause he was fed. and when i was asking ahri if she could defend her turret, he would tell me to shut up or he wont carry me, then constantly be trolling me, not cooperating in teamfights watching me die praising the enemy team when they would kill me. All I did was calling him a noob and stupid. then someone in my team told me to ignore him and I quoted that I hate how he tells me to shut up. I never said shut up, I quoted what he said. and guess what, 2 weeks bann because riot wanted me to ignore him and mute him. that was my first bann ever. Heres the chat logs: also, why i am telling you this? its so you understand every sanctions that i ever had in my account case entirely, every banns, and tell me what judgement you guys wouldve give me. heres the chat logs : 1: http://prntscr.com/g86b36 2: http://prntscr.com/g86b6g. \n\n\n\nsince then ive lost respect for riot and believed people that would tell me they dont care about this game and bann anybody. but i havent done anything else wrong since then to get myself banned. until the beggining of this year. a few months ago actually, this time, they didnt send any log chats on my email they just show me in my league profile my chat logs and ill admit, i was toxic, i was intentionally flaming people i didnt like, i dk why i was being like this, this whole month, i hated ahri players, i would call them names and never cooperate with them. anyways. i was toxic, that was my second time, and i got another 2 week bann. \n\n\n\nfew months later, yesterday.i just played a ranked game and had a lux that would refuse to listen to us, she was lux support going full ap even tho we needed actual support items for ruimble ult, etc. but she didnt care, she was like nope im going full ap :). even after doing her full combo on zed and not killing him, she still wouldnt listen to us, then we would get baron and say do not push too far without vision, and she would go bot without any vision to get the turret and die saying guys it was a free turret. anyways. i was SUPER tilted after this game. ive been holding myself and my discord friend kept telling me to stop typing so much that it wont change the fact that shes bad and stupid. but for me, she was really trolling, \n\n\n\nafter that game, i just left discord and i did the worst choice i couldve done, instead of taking a break to calm myself down, i decided to go play a non-rank game. i was super mad, i would enter the game and then karma would tell me to not feed? i just got super salty. and told her, lol not feed? stfu ill feed if i want to. afterwards i decided to focus on the game. vayne and karma would lose their lane and ACTUALLY feed. then vayne would ask me to switch lanes and I told her a respectfully. No. guess what? she ends up coming to my lane and as soon as she started hitting my first farm and taking my golds I told her words by WORDS ''GTFO YOU FUKIN TRASH TROLL I FUCKING HATE PEOPLE LIKE YOU'' stuff like that ''YOURE A FKIN TROLL TRASH'' blablabla, afterwards stuff would happen because she came and I would yell at her telling her what she did, then she would follow me and flash to get my kills. or steal my epic monsters ive been doing, and i would tell her ''tHE ONLY THING YOU CAN FKIN DO IS FOLLOW ME LIKE A DOG AND KS YOU FKIN TRASH TROLL' then she would type ''ez'' then i would be like ''THANKS FOR ADMITTING YOU FKIN TROLL'' I was TILTED okay, I had a BAD day, everyone has BAD days. I know I over reacted and I shouldnt have. I also ended up saying something salty to karma : lol dont feed and ur 0/8. but thats it. afterwards everything I would tell vayne was ''YOURE A FKIN TRASH TROLL THATS Y NO ONE TALKS TO YOU'' and she would since the beggining respond then i would. after a moment i just decided to mute her. and. then try to calm myself by encouraging the team. i would tell gj to karma since she was finally able to one shot, twitch, etc. but YEAH. ik now i typed too much BUT EVERYONE has bad days like I say, is this even worth a perma-bann?! where are the chat restricts these days?! Any of you couldve been frusturated and ending up on the same situation! I know I abused but still. after that? Permabann?!?!,oh also, once you read it, when i say the 1/3. its because she would tell me that im playing like shit so i would bring up her score on her face. oh yeah, i also said something else, she told me i was a retard so i just called her a retard back. heres the chatlog btw : http://prntscr.com/g86f60 . 2: http://prntscr.com/g86fjj. 3: http://prntscr.com/g86g77 . 4: http://prntscr.com/g86gb2 .\n\n\n\n\nSo tell me, you guys, I wouldve understand a chat restrict, or some other kind of bann. but was this worth a permabann?\nthe employee that i asked for help said that I got permabanned followed by ''many'' punishments. and that it started by someone insulting me then i would insult back which confuses me, i dont tihnk she knows what shes talking about. So I answered them back explaining the same thing as I did to you guys, and apparently someone else is gonna take charge of my riot ticket and im still waiting to see if Ill have a chance to get unbann. but, yeah. knowing the entire story, do you guys think I deserved this? dont you think permabann is not a too much slap on the ass for such things? its not like i told them i wish they die or something, the message up my bann said im among the 0.006% players that are negative enough to get permabanned, but its just a bad day damnit! so yeah, anyways, thanks for taking some of your time to read that stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"Leylania","date":"2017-08-14T06:15:29.267+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"TL,DR for everyone; The text is uninteressting explaining of what happened in the game, just click the links (first 2 for his ban in 2014 / others are for his recent ban).\n\nYes this ban was 100% deserved. Having trolls in your team is tilting we all know that.  But this does not give you the right to flame someone in the way you did. If you know you are in a bad mood then you don't play another game. And no you will not be unbanned, bans for flaming will never be lifted. Oh and explaining the situation doesn't change a thing, it does not matter what caused your flaming, only thing that is important is what you said.","replies":[{"poster":"Washior","date":"2017-08-14T06:21:20.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But what I said was just called her trash and troll wasn't it? Flaming someone the way I did? what do you mean? Also I just felt like telling the background so people understand my point of view. and also because riot support claims its because i was banned ''many times'' before when it wasnt exactly true. Yes, I got triggered cause of her and typed caps at her over and over that shes a trash troll. but wym the way I did? I never crossed the line that game into making it personal by telling her to kill herself or some horrible stuffs like that cause I knew crossing that line wouldve been awful right?! So is that really the punishment I deserve?","replies":[{"poster":"Leylania","date":"2017-08-14T07:12:50.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The 'many times' thing is a standard/default answer they give, a Rioter on another post here said they really have to change this since banned people always get confused about it, guess they haven't changed it yet. \n\n> But what I said was just called her trash and troll wasn't it?\n\nAnd that is okay for you or what? If i ever would have said something like this to someone I would probably write to the support if they could manually ban me just because I would be ashamed of what a brat I was. I don't know why they gave you a perma for this and I really don't care tbh. It's a game afterall, if you can't control your temper maybe a little time out from too much playing will give you the chance to get a bit more mature.","replies":[{"poster":"Washior","date":"2017-08-14T07:20:45.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't know y they gave me a permabann and u don't care, 1 if u dont y r u here i find it harsh to say :( 2 I know I overreacted but thank you for saying \"idk y they gave you a permabann for this\" cuz even u now sound confused, I agree that a ban to give me some time away would've help, maybe a longer ban than 2 weeks.

I don't go into a video game that is meant to bring fun, to tell people what worthless trash they are, I have manners unlike you. But you are right I'm not better than other decent people ofc, sad that you don't seem to belong to this kind of people.\n\nAs I said before I love to read those posts to know that the banning system is working which gives me the hope that the reports I send will actually have impact and maybe have the chance to get rid of atleast some of the flamers who ruin games for everyone.

Riot stated often enough that they will not again unban someone for flaming unless it was an error. The support will give you the same answer once they are done answering you. Riot made an experiment a few years ago where they gave perma banned people another chance and unbanned them if they were able to play on another account to lvl 30 without getting a single tiny punishment. The experiment failed completly and 95% of all player started flaming again before lvl 20. This is why I told you that your account is gone forever, not because I want to \"bring down your morals\" but because well, that's how it is.
