(CLOSE TO GET BAN) !HELP!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,since i change place, my computer and connection is not doing well. I recently got put in Low priority queue for 20 min for 5 game but i think that next time its a 2 week ban. I know that its annoying to my teammate to see me disconnect and loose cause of that but i can't really do anything about it. I'm trying my best to work on it and finding a way to fix it but until that i don't want to get ban cause this is my main account and i spend a lot of money on it. Can you guys help me about it and delete the low priority queue and make me so i cant get ban from disconnecting or crashing. PLS i love this game so much and i'm tired of waiting all this time before doing a game.","replies":[{"poster":"ArrowNTheNight","date":"2017-08-15T04:27:50.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also had this happen to me, but I haven't played lol in nearly 2 months.

It's unfortunate that it's caused you to end up with those LPQ's but rest assured it won't escalate to a ban.\n\nWith that being said, let's try to troubleshoot why you keep losing your connection in the first place. You might just need to update a few [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to make sure that your connection isn't being blocked by something like a firewall or incorrect DNS settings. Test it in a custom/practice game and let me know if it helps!","replies":[]}]}
