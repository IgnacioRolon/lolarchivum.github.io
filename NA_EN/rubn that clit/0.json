URF has become the one and ONLY beacon of fun that this game has left to offer. The fact that you have refused to keep it around as a permanent game mode is already egregious, but the fact that you&#039;ve made it RANDOM makes it hard to enjoy. Let me play the champion I WANT TO PLAY WHEN THIS BEAUTIFUL GAME MODE COMES AROUND. A draft mode at least. Just stop making it random. You&#039;ve stolen the fun out of everything else. Don&#039;t ruin the one thing that keeps this game worth playing.","replies":[]}
