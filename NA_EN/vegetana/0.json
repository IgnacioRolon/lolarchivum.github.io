I propose Riot should not only do weekend special modes, but also introduce double xp and double IP as motives for more people to get on and also for more people to play the featured modes. In addition to this I think you should also make a new map option, the rift is great, but poviding an interesting alternative could bring more people to enjoy League. You could also make it a DLC pack, in the form of a seperate Client, I am not aware of the amount of resources it would take for riot to accomplish this so it doesn&#039;t neccessarily need to be a seperate client. I am going to be continually posting new ideas for you guys on this board, I hope you check it out.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-02-21T01:30:01.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They do have another map, 3 in fact. \n\n3v3 or the Twisted Treeline was the first, it is fun and a completely different game at higher levels of play. It has 2 lanes, alters to contest which give team buffs, and Vilemaw, who is the baron alternative.\n\nARAM, or the Howling Abyss (Murder Bridge) is a 5v5 mode with a single lane and random champions for each player. You also can't heal or buy without doeing.\n\nAnd dominion, or the Crystal Scar was a circular map where you captured points to damage the enemy nexus instead of pushing to attack it directly. It is now a rotating game mode instead of its own queue.\n\nThey occasionally do double weekends, idk why they don't more often, but honestly I am sitting here with 20k ip. They probably opt for more general ip instead of weekend boosts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RadiatedApples","date":"2017-02-21T01:23:34.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so DLC to play the special gamemodes?\nplease clarify.","replies":[]}]}
