I was confused as to why so I checked my match history and only found that I lost two games in a row. This never happened to me before no matter how low my mmr was so why did this happen? Is this a bug/glitch?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-06T02:18:47.393+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Losing games when you're at 0 LP always carries the risk of being demoted, regardless of what your MMR is (you cannot see this on the client, and third party sites are very often incorrect). It looks like you lost 2 games while at 0 LP which caused you to demote.","replies":[{"poster":"Securely","date":"2017-11-06T12:21:06.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand but I actually only lost 1 game while at 0 LP.\nBefore the two losses, I won a game which I gained 17/18 LP. I then lost the next game which brought it down to 0 LP. \nThe third game was the only game I lost while at 0 LP during that time frame. I thought there was some grace period while at 0 LP :/\nStill confused about this ranking system. Thanks anyways.","replies":[]}]}]}
