Rarely. Those items are often used for certain \"types\" of champs rather than \"classes.\" On-hit items are the best example of this. On-hit items being strong ends up being broken for one type of champion(on-hit), but not oneclass. {{item:3124}} meta/fad, for instance, had {{champion:23}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:96}} . How often do champs in any other class build crit? Basically never, unless you take an ADC mid, and even then, most of those don't get crit ({{champion:110}} can, people don't do it anymore though). The exceptions are {{champion:23}} {{champion:157}} who have crit as a part of their niche/design/kit. \n\nDo not forget there's an entire class devoted to ADCs, the support role.\n\nADCs seem to have some problem in any sort of meta:\n\n{{item:3071}} {{item:3142}}{{item:3035}}  :{{champion:202}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:21}}(support MF even became a thing) ({{champion:119}} can be on there, w/ Korean meta build)\n{{item:3057}} : Ap/AD {{champion:81}} (Runic echoes smite ezreal mid was even meta for a while)\n{{item:3153}} {{item:3124}} : {{champion:96}} {{champion:67}} \n{{item:3085}} (it's an ADC item only, but ADCs limit it from being used elsewhere): {{champion:29}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:22}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:429}} \n{{item:3022}} :any of them\n\nSo, what ADCs have not been listed into the item abuser category?\n{{champion:119}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:22}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:6}} \n\nHow many of those are actually bot lane ADCs?\n{{champion:6}} (questionable, but I'll put him here anyways){{champion:119}} {{champion:22}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:110}} \n\n3/5 of those are just the pure utility ADCs that are meta in LCS(and high elo) and contested picks. Varus being the most recent one. {{champion:6}} is.... obviously fairly unsuited to go bot. But he can go there nonetheless. There hasn't been enough data or experimentation on Urgot bot to draw a conclusion.\n\nNow Marksmen in general:\n{{champion:150}} (mini): {{item:3022}} \n{{champion:133}} : does use lethality, but not the more common BC/Yoummus, but Duskblade/Youmuus, which has basically always been part of her. Luc had crit and triforce(spellslinger, which is what he should be) builds, MF had crit builds, and Jhin was using crit until lethality buffs. Draven also used crit, should he be considered one of the lethality abusers. Riot has basically given up on her adcing\n{{champion:104}}: ... basically had a overbearing dominance in top and jg for quite a long time last season. Abuses juggernaut items, as well as youmuus, Death's Dance, Phantom dancer... he's like a ADC tank. Almost like Urgot.\n{{champion:42}} : moved to mid, and he's sorta become like a mage. I can't speak for him because I don't really know much about it. Supposedly really annoying to deal with in high elo. He's still entirely dependant on {{item:3078}} . \n{{champion:6}} honestly isn't really much of a marksmen. An AD caster? He's getting a rework...\n{{champion:268}} : Bullies early, hypercarry lategame. I **think** Riot said he was a failure like Kalista, but I'm unsure. Eitherway, he's always contested in LCS like Kalista, unless he's nerfed out of LCS, which ends up with him being gutted out of soloQ. He did abuse Rylai's. \n{{champion:126}} : isn't really a marksmen, even in ranged form. If you do want to see his issues, there are a _lot_ of threads. Right now, he abuses youmuus/BC, but I don't count him as a marksmen.\n{{champion:85}} : Rylai's/Protobelt, but mostly the latter. He's been nerfed out of the meta. \n{{champion:203}} is an \"adc\", but in jg and not bot, so I didn't want to include her/him/it. Kindred also depends on {{item:3085}} {{item:3022}} . Looks like people are starting to get cleaver on her too.\n{{champion:17}} : Currently also abuses {{item:3022}} {{item:3085}} . Historically, he has often used {{item:3115}} (which never was a problematic item because of how very few champs would buy it), and {{item:3151}}","replies":[{"poster":"E102 Gamma Y","date":"2017-02-14T21:22:25.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2017-02-14T23:37:12.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know enough info about Maw to recall why it was created. I know it dated really far back, though. \n\nSterak was made exclusively for juggernauts, in the juggernaut update. It amplified base attack, and didn't add bonus AD, to ensure that it wouldn't be abused by ADCs or assassins. Only juggernauts would scale nicely with an increase in base AD, and not additive bonus AD. \n\nMallet is mostly used by the top lane ADCs and marksmen. Gnar, and Teemo being the most common users.\n\nEz gets IBG because he already has good range and kiting for an adc. It gives him an unnecessary amount of self-peel. He's an ADC, meant to be squishy and killed by anything unless he plays it safe. IBG allowed him to play a lot more aggressively without punishment, which shouldn't happen. It is only abused on Ezreal. Ezreal abuses all sheen items, which sucks for other champs that want to use them. IBG, Triforce, and Lich Bane. At least Corki only uses Triforce.\n\nCleaver is used in every lane now. Mid lane assassins, top lane everything(they basically made juggernauts have to buy black cleaver), bot lane ADCs. Only supports don't get it.\n\nYou're probably right about youmuus pre-rework being an item for adcs. But it was a niche item. After rework, it was geared only for assassins. There's no reason for ADCs to be buying it. They removed so many ADC benefits from youmuus, and they [ADCs] still buy the item a lot.\n\nI mentioned those items.\n\nBotrk/Rageblade are for onhit champions, not just ADCs or marksmen. This includes melee champs as well. Examples are Jax, and pre-rework Warwick. Kayle or Voli would buy it, but they have better item choices (Nashor's Tooth, Titanic Hydra, respectively, wit's end for both of them) now. Yasuo was designed around crit, as I also mentioned in the earlier response. He and Trynd will depend on crit.\n\nWhen they reworked GP, I don't know what they had in mind for him. I know they wanted him to build Triforce, but I don't know about Crit. Prob should rewatch the champion spotlight; those items give a good idea of what Riot \"wanted\" for a certain item or champion. If youmuus wasn't featured as an item for ADCs in the older champion spotlights, it likely wasn't meant to be used for them. If youmuus was often recommended to assassins in their champion spotlights, it was probably designed for them.\n\nYou're right about Zed using Bloodthirster. Not just him, basically every AD champion used BT as the final AD item in the end. Even then, it wasn't good on most of them(if they weren't ADCs), but they still bought them when they could(Zed also had Botrk and Ravenous Hydra). \n\nSo, where would this put BT. \n\"Abused by all AD champions.\" In that case, the user list is so broad, it's not abuse. I'm leaning towards saying the same thing for Death's Dance. I forgot which champion updated they added that in, but I believe it was the ADC one.\n\nAs mentioned in the earlier post, I also believe ADC should only be bot lane carries. Riot has gotten rid of \"adc\" and replaced it with \"marksmen,\" so I opted to use their definition instead.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2017-02-14T04:30:08.691+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Poppy is a fighter. poppy  gets defensive steriods  for being low hp that most melee champions dont have . dont use poppy as your base for tanks or fighters.\n adcs are faster than poppy and nearly every other melee champion with out a shit ton of low cooldown dashes on their main damage skills and so are mages with {{item:3086}}  and {{item:3113}}  items.\nlethality was not made for adcs and was specficly made to stop adcs who were already building armor penetration from building it along with stopping assassin from snowballing to easily","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ultra Rapid Fyre","date":"2017-02-13T16:43:44.575+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":20,"body":"against an all AD team... no one is even running tabis.. or frozen heart... yea i feel no sympathy for you","replies":[{"poster":"Catastrop","date":"2017-02-13T17:46:07.702+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ultra Rapid Fyre,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pkF4WMpH,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-02-13T16:43:44.575+0000)\n>\n> against an all AD team... no one is even running tabis.. or frozen heart... yea i feel no sympathy for you\n\nFH would be worthless here because none of them are aa'ing that much to begin, same with Tabi. \n\n~~~Let's also completely ingore the fact that Eve and Kled built a Randuin's and DMP.

You just are unable to accept it, or maybe just not able to look at things from any other angle than what you see straight up.\n\nHave a nice day.","replies":[{"poster":"Quantum Velocity","date":"2017-02-14T22:19:31.904+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's also the fact that even before this trend when AD champs did go the armor pen route... they didn't go full pen.... they simply got 1-2 pen items to round out a 6 item build to stay relevant in the late game. Now with 3 items that give move speed, lethality, high AD, and active/passive addons. I could understand 1 item that has all of those things.... but 3?! The items are overloaded. If they want to keep the items as they are atm.... then they are going to need to give armor items more armor. The easier balance to do is to nerf lethality back how it was. They went from 40% to 60%.... what was wrong with trying 50% first.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2017-02-14T00:28:47.456+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe because everyone and their mother is building it, and using it way too effectively?","replies":[{"poster":"Handin Out Naps","date":"2017-02-14T01:30:38.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you are an ad champion and you cast ablities as your main source of damage, you should be itemizing armor penetration.  Lethality can use some nerfs, no one is even arguing that.  But this thread is retarded for saying that there is no build diversity when legit all of them are ad casters and should be itemizing armor penetration.  If you want build diversity introduce more items, but then there will be way too much lethality.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
