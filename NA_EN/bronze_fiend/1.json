Tried CTRL-ESC also CTRL-ALT-DELETE won't help either. \r\n\r\nBefore, i could only alt-tab if i was spamming it just as it prompted me. All my friends have such problems with it. I am sure a lot of you do as well. I remember encountering problems with alt-tabbing while in loading screen for like 2 years now.","replies":[{"poster":"stokastic","date":"2016-08-09T22:50:35.999+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shot in the dark here, but alt-tab doesn't do anything if you have no other active windows open.

This could be caused by some OS or hardware problems or it could be a simple setting. Let me know, thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Bronze fiend","date":"2016-08-11T17:04:48.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm only playing in full-screen. It is \"working\" now. By working i mean just as it used to work all these years. I can only alt-tab during loading screen if i spam alt-tab just as the loading screen is prompted. If you're not fast enough, you'd have to wait like 10-15 seconds in loading screen to be able to alt-tab then. CTRL - ALT - DELETE won't work either but the settings will prompt. Anyway, choosing task manager or pressing alt-tab therefore won't do anything, just bring you back to the loading screen.\n\nHope i was clear enough.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-11T18:25:35.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you switch to Borderless windowed mode to see if you experience the same behavior?

And even if it wouldn't, i'm pretty sure i don't like the borderless mode. I will try, if i don't forget to change it at the end of the match.\n\nEDIT : I doubt it's caused by a windows settings. By the time i posted that, i had just installed windows 10. And it's been happening to me on 8.1 pro 64bit and windows 7 both 64 and 32 bits as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-11T23:53:16.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can make the changes fairly quickly in a custom match with no bots or human players.
