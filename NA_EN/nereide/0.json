This is my first ever post and what brought me to come here and share my thoughts is today's PBE launch of the new champion, Senna. \n\nLet me start by saying that I'm really excited about her and her gameplay. I've been playing support for some time now and I always dreamed of someone that could fit my aggro play without getting too close (like pyke) so I'm genuinely happy, BUT I couldn't believe what some of the animations came to be! \n\nI'm the type of person that although i'm a \"grown-up\", I couldn't watch a horror movie even if somebody gave me a thousand dollars due to the long term PTSD/Night terrors I'd have. League of Legends is my little hapy place where I go to distract myself from life and anxiety and now i've to literally panic at Senna's W...I'm specifically talking about when seh activetes \"a mist\" around her, ally champs that come out of it look like the WORST nightmare i could ever have!! On top of this, Riot published the new model for Fiddlesticks{{champion:9}} ... why WHY?! I'm sorry but why the hell would I want something so unsettling? i understand some people like horror and f****d up things, but i don't believe the rift is the proper place for it. Kids play this game and some adults are also sensitive to certain images. \n\nIs there not a discussion about this? I believe they listen to their audience quite a bit so if anybody has similar thougt please share them with me because i'm genuinely curious to know. I'm considering not playing the base skin (her passive \"ghouls\" are not something i wanna see all around me, why couldn't they be just dark spheres?) but since i cant control the opponent skin choice, i wish there was an alternative. \n\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-1}}","replies":[]}
