If i had to chose id recommend {{champion:34}} , she's fun, has a strong kit, and nukes like no other. Also, you can't beat \"*Egnivia\"* in chat. \n\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"MaliceCity","date":"2014-02-11T23:25:31.308+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best part is typing as many egg puns in all-chat while in Egnivia form!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kumoho","date":"2014-02-14T02:50:03.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks guys!!

She has a more intuitive and easier kit imho. Almost all of her dps is locked in her E, but she can still be quite useful late game with her utility (walls, slows).
