It normally lasts 1.25 seconds. It now lasts as long as an Aatrox Q.\r\n\r\n* You gain a Turret(Q) charge upon respawning. This can bug out if you already have 2 Turrets as you respawn and you can end-up holding 4 Turret Kits.\r\n\r\n* R+W and W no longer share a cooldown. This means that you can R+W, even if W is on cooldown.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that these changes are a subset of some other Heim changes that haven&#039;t been revealed yet and managed to sneak their way through to live. Unless he gets disabled / hotfixed quickly, you can go and try all of these out right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2018-12-05T22:31:48.834+0000","up_votes":54,"down_votes":1,"body":"A bunch of Heimerdinger bugs got introduced this patch.
