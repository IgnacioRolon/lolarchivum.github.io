Xin Zhao comes in for a gank. He&#039;s got this crazy attack speed steroid, that will finish his 3rd Talon Strike and knock you up...by then, half your HP has disappeared. You are forced to flash, but he uses his crazy 600 range dash and ignored the fact you used a summoner spell, then he will slow you down and you will die. They nerf Kassadin, but they don&#039;t nerf him, who can win every single game by camping top lane? I&#039;ve honoured all Xin Zhao mains, and save RP to gift them at the end of every game.\nI'd want some help and I want to know how to deal with him.","replies":[{"poster":"Stonington","date":"2015-05-01T07:26:37.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He gets three autos off before you can run away and without using his gap closer? I dunno, I guess you deserve to die. Outplayed.\n\nXin is really reliable and has super strong ganks. But he doesn't scale well with items. He wants too much. He want's AS, AD, CDR, and tankiness, But unfortunately you can't efficiently build all of those stats at the same time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darkmind1212","date":"2015-05-01T07:15:28.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry but what you posted sounded purely situational. While yes his engages are crazy strong you have to note that he has no real manes to get out of a mess once it starts. If you are tired of him ganking you then make sure to get extra wards or don't push to far when you don't have the sight.","replies":[]}]}
