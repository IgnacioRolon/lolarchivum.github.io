Instead of the Chest and Key, a loot item similar to the Birdie Capsule seems  like a more respectable choice given the rarity of the gemstones. Here are some ideas.\n\n* 1 Gemstone: &quot;Runic Hextech Chest (WIP)&quot; - works almost exactly like the Birdie Capsule, and instead of a Birdie Bag it can be a Runic Satchel\n\n* 1 Gemstone: &quot;Class Capsule&quot; - works like a Birdie Capsule, only no Birdie Bag-like item, the appeal of this is that it will only contain content from a certain Champion class or subclass. There can either be a choice of it, or it changes every once in a while.\n\n* 1 Gemstone: &quot;The Other Box&quot; - will contain content focused on wards, emotes, and summoner&#039;s icon with a high chance for multiples\n\n* 3 Gemstones: &quot;Primal Hextech Cache (WIP)&quot; - basically Runic Hextech Chest on steroids, maybe with a 4x multiplier on value\n\n* 5 Gemstones: Hextech Ward Skin*- originally I felt the ward skin was too expensive, but if Riot feels that is not the case, then I think it is too lonely and could use a friendly ward or two of similar design and cost\n\n* 10 Gemstones: The skins as they are now, their value is in their rarity and not so much their appearance\n\n\nThe main thing is, more variety and the removal of the \"trap\" that is the hextech box (in my opinion).","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-04-11T04:09:53.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I inexplicably got the hextech ward from the shit riot gave away when crafting debuted, and it has sat there ever since, mocking me as the only real use for gemstones below 10, which i already have and will never use...\n\nIt would be nice to be able to trade them for random skin shards over a certain rarity, or maybe select a skin with the \"your shop\" algorithm..","replies":[{"poster":"Bioness","date":"2018-04-11T06:03:55.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yYxZ0oPm,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-04-11T04:09:53.901+0000)\n>\n> I inexplicably got the hextech ward from the shit riot gave away when crafting debuted, and it has sat there ever since, mocking me as the only real use for gemstones below 10, which i already have and will never use...\n> \n> It would be nice to be able to trade them for random skin shards over a certain rarity, or maybe select a skin with the &quot;your shop&quot; algorithm..\n\nI feel like Riot is really against the \"refund/trade-in\" mentality to begin with. I unfortunately don't see Riot changing their views on refunds of skins/other collectible, even in a turn-in format barring those skin shards that you can re-roll into hopefully something better.\n\nMe personally I love the look  of the Hextech Ward, but in no way do I 5 gemstone love it. I only felt keeping the price the same is because ward skins are roughly half the price of (Epic) skins which seems to be the quality of the exclusive skins.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hexs Fortune","date":"2018-04-11T04:02:41.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree the stones are not worth transforming into a key and box.
