Despite me being honor level 4, despite me having numerous honor capsules and loading screen flair i get banned for 14 days after having two trolling characters in a ranked game. Even after wanting to afk and not caring about getting a report because of how toxic they were i still played as well as i could and arguably doing the best on my team... and upon completing the game i get a 14 day suspension from playing all together. How and why is this even allowed? I stayed with the team, i made plays with the team all while the other guy ran out as soon as he spawned and tried fighting 4 people at once just to die, never helping lanes and when asking for help he would just say \"yawn\".  I know im not in the minority here i feel this happens a lot where the only way people get banned is from reviewing chat logs on the website. Which i might add is also done by a  toxic community instead of reviewing what the player does in game. someone can not say a single word all game yet uncontrollably feed and never get banned, reducing many many other players experiences during ranked games. i didnt give Riot thousands of dollars to have my experience ruined by another player and im not allowed to get mad about it and when i do i get a 14 day suspension. rant over i guess, i imagine this wont attract the attention of anyone important anyways","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-12T03:43:48.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel you, it really sucks to feel like you're being held hostage in game when other players do trolly things like that. The best way to deal with them is to simply report them in post game so we can review what happened and take action if needed. Fighting back through the in-game chat and using homophobic slurs might not help, and could have been the main reason as to why your account was banned. \n\nIf you don't remember what happened or need to open up that discussion, you're always welcome to reach out to the player behavior team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[{"poster":"nightmaresasuke","date":"2017-12-12T04:04:10.272+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":1,"body":"its not just that, its just like i stated in game, i cannot play with my irl friends anymore because of the limitations the staff have put on this game. Every single one of my irl friends got put immediately from provisionals into silver or gold with sometimes having worse win/loss ratio than me for provisionals. I now cannot Q up with any of them for ranked games because i somehow got put into bronze 5 out of provisionals and the staff thought it was a good idea not to allow anyone in bronze to play with anyone in higher brackets despite me getting silver every season before. \n\nTL:DR ~I Literally cannot play games with my friends and when i do play ranked i shouldnt have to be subjected to that type of behavior and if i am i shouldnt be the one thats banned for expressing how angry i am over someone else When i was doing everything i could to make sure we still win the game. If the staff here can cater to snowflakes that dislike Slurs they can cater to anyone. Im still so overwhelmingly mad that someone purposely trying to ruin that game THE GAME didnt have anything bad happen to them yet i get BANNED for 14 days for expressing how mad i am by calling someone a \"homophobic\" slur. Someone who gets mad at someone ruining the game that should be everyone who wants the game to continue to thrive, the chat logs enforce what im saying with how many people said they would report the other person in question.  \n\nI just honestly want to know whats more toxic to the game, People expressing how mad they are while trying to win and someone is deturing that, OR someone never saying anything \"abusive\" but constantly degrading the game state for anyone they get teamed with in ranked games and never getting any bans because there arent any logs to go by, they never \"SAY\" anything specifically bad","replies":[]}]}]}
