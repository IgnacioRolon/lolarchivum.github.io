Coddling is going to ruin them? Sure. Ya know, it's all up to those numbers. Some respond positively to flame, some don't, most don't.

When someone show me angers signals, I mute them instantly, because no matter what happen, only negative will spread from them. In no situation, angers is the answer, ever ! No matter how hard you try to show your points, negative feedback will always happen. If people are negative, it's probly not going to change but it should never be the answer to anything.

Most of the players lean towards the casual side from what I know and aren't looking to be berated by some angry, insecure wreck whose JUST looking for a way to vent life's frustrations(The criticism they give usually ain't the same as coaches, sorry). Oh yeah, and you're probably only going to see most players once or twice, so that \"you and everyone on my teams sucks but ME\" attitude isn't going to improve anyone in the course of a game or two. Your high-school basketball team? A bit of a long time commitment, there. \n\nAnd, well, the toxicity you find in league is farrrrr harsher from what you'd find your typical high school/college sport's coach shouting. And one almost always knows when to stop if he/she ever goes too far and is willing to give out compliments, the other doesn't and won't. \n\nAlso, as said in my previous post, most of the individuals who troll/flame in league are no more resistant to their own BS than the people they harass. They're insecure, stressed out, and angry at the thought of losing one of their Oh Soooo precious normal/ranked/EvenUrf games, so they flame, and it doesn't help.
