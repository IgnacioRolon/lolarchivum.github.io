And the game before that we lost we got 81 ip that game lasted for about 40 mins...... So I'm thinking the longer your game is the more rewards. Like any game past 1 hour gets 100 ip op( and bonus for win) after 1 hour it will be 100 ip there on out, cause a almost hour and a half game for nothing and a 40 min game fire more rewards ticks me off, hour down the drain","replies":[]}
