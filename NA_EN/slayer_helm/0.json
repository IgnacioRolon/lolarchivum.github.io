(im good with computers but know little about the connection side of things) (my FPS is fine lowest of 40 mostly at 60) \r\n\r\nto help myself i have contacted my ISP they said they see nothing wrong from their end i have HARD reset my router multiple times, Flushed DNS (dunno what that does) and ran a few Tracer tests and i see some packet loss. \r\n\r\nthis ONLY happens on League of legends since around the start of Season 6. i have played on a Wireless connection since season 3.\r\n\r\nAny help is greatly appreciated","replies":[{"poster":"MarshmallowBob","date":"2016-02-11T03:12:34.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to eliminate wireless as the problem, is it possible for you to play on a wired connection? If not, how close are you to the router?\n\nDo you have a 5GHz or a 2.4GHz wireless modem? The difference there is that 5GHz tends to be more stable (but has less range) because fewer devices are on that band.

This is just an easy first step to \"prove\" it's an issue with wireless; if the same issues are happening on wired it would be a totally different troubleshooting path.\n\nLet me know how it goes on wired! In the meantime, if you can also give me your router make & model as well as the wireless adapter you use for your PC that would get a head start on next steps.","replies":[{"poster":"FrankerX","date":"2016-02-11T03:31:15.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dear riot,\n\nsame problem for me since 6.1 (this somehow always happens at season starts) \ni play a custom game with a friend against 5 bots, everything is fine.\nthe moment i start a normal/aram my ping goes up to 8k and i dc all the time.\n\nno problems in other games :/ no problems in season 5 or the preseason.","replies":[{"poster":"MarshmallowBob","date":"2016-02-11T17:47:45.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry to hear you're having connection troubles too :(\n\nWould you mind letting me know if you play on wireless or wired as well?","replies":[{"poster":"FrankerX","date":"2016-02-11T17:52:43.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i play on wireless but i tried to use a wire. sadly didnt fix it :/","replies":[{"poster":"MarshmallowBob","date":"2016-02-11T20:24:05.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hm, okay.
