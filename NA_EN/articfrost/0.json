I hope the little bugger wasn&#039;t removed intentionally because him running through Bards arms was absolutely awesome.\n\nRecreation of Bug (on NA Server here):\n1) Play Bard on Classic Skin. (I don&#039;t own Bard&#039;s Elderwood skin and too poor to buy it right now to see if the skin is also bugged)\n2) Type in /dance.\n3) Bard dances, but his soul is not in it because his Meep is not dancing with him. \n\nIf Bard could cry, he would be. His dancing Meep was his BFF and Bard misses him just like Pluto misses being a planet. Please Rito, give Bard his BFF back.\n\nThanks!\n~watermaester\n\nEdit: FOR GRAMMAR!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-04-21T17:14:11.016+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Watermaester!\n\nThis is definitely a bug!
