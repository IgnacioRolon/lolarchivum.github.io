He mains Gnar and I main soraka.  Yes Gnar adc.  His skill level is around mid to high gold and as of writing this he has 771,000 mastery points on gnar.  I probably don&#039;t have to explain to you that we&#039;re doing just fine in low silver right now.  But there&#039;s always the doubting teammate.  The one guy who decides gnar adc isn&#039;t viable and either locks him in the lane he&#039;s picking or bans him just to spite us.  We always dodge when it happens and it&#039;s like 20% of our games.  Gnar and soraka is our thing and we&#039;re very successful doing it.\n\nSo that&#039;s my sob story.  It doesn&#039;t make any sense that you can ban the champion your teammate has selected.  Please remove this feature.

A champion in league of legends is pick or ban\n2.  A teammate is willing to jeopardize the game on the off chance he gets this champion\n\nNeither of these are ideal scenarios in league.  I understand that they happen once in a while but only once in a while.  The game is designed to prevent this from happening.  You're basically assuming that since problems like these might exist it's best to allow players power over each other rather than fixing the problem.  This is faulty logic.  The obvious solution is to just fix the problem.  Players who jeopardize their team will lose more games.  Champions that are pick/ban get nerfed.  Now what about the 99.9% of other league games?","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-03-10T17:00:15.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"1. you cant make ask for your argument without the fact that at any given patch... any given champ can be pick/ban.\n\n\nSo you cant want one idea without the possibility of the other happening.","replies":[{"poster":"eslayx","date":"2018-03-10T20:36:22.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And?  What's your point?  I agree it's a problem that a last pick player has power over his team to screw them over by picking a pick/ban champ and disallowing it from being banned.  But what you're saying is that the solution is more power in the hands of players?  Now you want to give the rest of the team power over each other's champions?  Isn't this the very problem you mentioned?\n\nHow do you solve a power struggle by giving everyone more power?  The answer is very clear: you don't.  You take away everyone's power over each other and put it back into their own hands.  \n\nGood:\nI get to chose my champion, you get to chose your own champion. \n\nBad: I get to chose what champion you play, you get to chose what champion I play\n\nGet the picture?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Djiz Djinn","date":"2018-03-10T18:18:44.048+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think there should be a patch to make it so your own team can't ban or pick what you've already selected and to me, your \"scenario\" is a pretty useless excuse tbh. This game is supposed to be team oriented and if YOUR team doesn't like what you have selected, then they should ask if they can first pick for you so the other team doesn't get the champion instead of just banning off the champion you desired without asking. I think it's pretty clear that your champion hasn't been banned off or troll picked by your own team enough for you to wrap your tiny little brain around this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"spiritwolf34","date":"2018-03-10T09:37:46.033+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

My own team bans or takes Gnar because they don't think Gnar works in bot or they just don't want me taking Gnar bot.\nHaving a team mate pick the champ I want before I get to pick or banning that champ just to spite my really makes me mad and why I dodge.
