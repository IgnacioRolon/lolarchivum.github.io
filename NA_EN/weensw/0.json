As much as I like the mode, to ask Riot to keep it up at such lower player base makes me feel kind of guilty. I still wish everyday I could play Dominion or Ascension everyday, but they do have a valid reason for not upkeeping it. On a scale of 1 to 10 where 5.5 is considered \"average\", I'd give Nexus Blitz a 6.5 out of 10. Aram 4 out of 10, Rift 2.5 out of 10. Of course, Dominion/Ascension to me was 9 out of 10, but I can't be selfish and just ask them to keep it, they're a business afterall.","replies":[{"poster":"Slam Dùnk","date":"2019-01-07T09:04:14.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Weensw,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QA7NFUJh,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-01-07T05:59:08.761+0000)\n>\n> Dominion and Ascension was my favorite modes, however, at one point, Riot said that the player base of Twisted Tree line was very low a few months ago, but still a lot better than the player base of what Dominion used to be.

I found it really fun the first time it was on live servers, but not as much the second time. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still fun, but it obviously needs changes if it’s gonna become a permanent mode. First of all I think the GA reward needs to go. Nothing is more tilting than losing the first event and the enemy team getting GA’s that early on. I also don’t care for the paranoia event, but that could jsut be personal preference. Also if they are going to make it permanent they would/should look at mode specific balance changes to some champions. Now that the mode has been out for a while between both of its visits to the live servers, people are starting to figure out what champions are really good and just spamming them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Naalith","date":"2019-01-07T13:56:35.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally? I think it was extremely fun at first but after doing the quests specifically for blitz I felt no desire to play it again. Last time it released I thought it was just trash, so it has improved massively in the second iteration. Perhaps a 3.0 version could hold my interest for longer but there's lots of work that needs to be done. Now that it's been out a month and a meta was starting to form and the wackiness has sort of dulled to those of us who have been playing, I'm not sure I would really ever play it again in its current state.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XxDRAGONsAK47xX","date":"2019-01-07T13:33:54.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When can we play other games again??? \n\nIts been almost 2 years since Ascension was last available.
