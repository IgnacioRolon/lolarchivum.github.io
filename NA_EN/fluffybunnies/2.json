I get matched with bronze teamates whom i cannot carry with feeding them may have done. For instance... getting out of bronze is easy as hell, but silver 5? Seems impossible\n\nEDIT: I just want to get to the rank where I actually struggle with just my laner and a jungler. Not because nearly every match im getting destroyed because someone fed not one but several enemies.\n\nI know that feeding happens in all elos, but my point is that I would actually like a challenging rank. Im sick of just beating down my laner. How can i get better by that","replies":[{"poster":"grug","date":"2017-02-14T04:41:22.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fervor on draven lul?\n\nthat might be a huge problem for you, fervor has been dog shit on draven ever since they removed the ability stack on it. you used to be able to get 2 stacks with the spinning axe i believe.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Snowman Arc","date":"2017-02-14T04:22:50.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll say it again, if you think you deserve better, you will get better. I just played some games on my smurf on bronze 1, where I had my bottom lane being 0/6 at the first 5 minutes. We still won the game with my being Elise jungle, by knowing how to play the map and what my win condition would be. My bottom lane ended up being something like 3/30 combined and we still won the game at 30 minutes. And just imagine, this was one of the hardest games to win, at first I thought it couldn't be salvaged, but I did win it for my team. \n\nAlso, not all games will be like that. Some games, the trolls are on the enemy team and you get an easy win. Even if they are on your team, if you're good enough, you can carry at least half of these games. Don't blame your team, blame yourself. Grind through the games and you will climb. If you think you belong at least in Gold, then achieving a 55% + winrate in S5 shouldn't be an issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-02-14T02:57:58.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why do you think you're the only one getting bad teammates? If you're actually good your team will only have 4/5 potential feeders, while the enemy team has 5/5. No matter how you look at it, the odds should be stacked on your favor.
