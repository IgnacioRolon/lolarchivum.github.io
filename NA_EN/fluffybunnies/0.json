Anyone know how long that may take?\r\n\r\nSide note, if anyone has a solution to my problem this is it.\r\n\r\nLEAGUE OF LEGENDS PATCHER CLIENT NOT OPENING\r\n\r\n--The league badge pops up once, and then a second time because i deleted the files in downloads, the air client something or the other, and everything in solutions. So ive looked at all the responses by riot devs/admins. Done it all and nothing has worked.\r\n\r\nWhen I double click on league of legends icon, or run in administrator the process wont even show up on my processes list. Nor is it running in the background somewhere else.\r\n\r\nThis problem occurred after I system restored to about 3 weeks prior. (due to a windows issue)\r\n\r\nI also have tried uninstalling and re-installing. Sadly I've spent 5 hours researching and trying everything i possibly can do. Done everything with no positive results other than getting the very short 2nd league client icon with a little bar which disapears within a split second","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-29T22:31:59.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Response time can vary depending on the size of the queue for a day.  I've looked into your ticket, and verified that it's been escalated to our tech team who will review the situation and help out!  In the meantime, I'm happy to provide some first steps in case that might help!  \n\nIt's really important that you don't delete any files or modify them, as doing that can end up causing more problems than solving them.  I recommend grabbing our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and performing a clean reinstall to restore your files to a fresh state.  The initial issue you're having sounds like a security setting problem with your OS that's preventing the patcher from launching.  I recommend going over each step of our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to fix this for good.  Best of luck!","replies":[{"poster":"FluffyBunnies","date":"2016-09-30T01:15:23.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"According to Riot Dev's deleting files was suggested. It was also suggested on the riot support site. Infact i actually fixed the problem by deleting more files that Riot execs did not suggest deleting. However they also did not mention to not delete the one i deleted. I'll be sure to let them know about how to fix the problem I had as I'm sure they will in fact tell me to delete what I did delete. \n\nThank you though.","replies":[]}]}]}
