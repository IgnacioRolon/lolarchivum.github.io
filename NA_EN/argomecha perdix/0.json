{"poster":"Argomecha Perdix","date":"2015-01-26T21:16:29.667+0000","title":"Shouldn't all Elixirs be able to extend its duration like the Wrath one?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":36,"down_votes":2,"body":"So one of the items reintroduced this season were the elixirs ({{item:2138}} {{item:2137}} {{item:2139}} {{item:2140}}), so far they have been fulling their purpose of adding extra stats to a build for a short period of time, on a relatively cheap price. This is great! I always buy at least one elixir during any game, with any champ.\r\n\r\nThe thing here is that if you read the description for each one, you can see, they all last for 3 minutes. Except for {{item:2140}}, which can last way longer if used properly. Every kill and/or assist extend the duration of the Elixir for 30 seconds.\r\n\r\nI'm not complaining for this, but I think there should be a way to increase the duration of other Elixirs so that for extended teamfights or sieges, tanks, mages, supports, or whoever has an elixir, can endure as long as any AD champ with {{item:2140}}.\r\n\r\nThis isn't a really big balance issue, but I think it's not fair for a mage that gets a Triple Kill with {{item:2139}}, or a tank that scores 4 assists in a row with {{item:2138}} lose their bonuses before a champ with {{item:2140}} and 2 assists, for example :P\r\n\r\nMy proposition is to allow {{item:2139}} to be extended with kills or assists like its AD counterpart, while {{item:2138}} can be extended by how much CC got reduced from the elixir (Sounds a bit weird, so let me explain: If you have 35% Tenacity, and any champ uses a 1 second stun on you, you're effectively stunned for 0.65 seconds; so {{item:2138}} could increase its duration based on how many seconds you WEREN'T CC'ed) and {{item:2137}}'s duration could be extended by taking down towers.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR**\r\nThe extended duration on {{item:2140}} is to reward players who manage to fulfill their role as AD carries/assassins, but I believe that if any other class benefits from an Elixir, and they also manage successfully use its bonuses, they should be rewarded by extending the duration of their Elixirs too. After all, Mages and Tanks need love too.","replies":[{"poster":"Shıma","date":"2015-01-26T22:02:26.717+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"League of Marksmen","replies":[{"poster":"Akesgeroth","date":"2015-01-27T07:14:22.735+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mean league of AD.","replies":[{"poster":"Marinaras Trench","date":"2015-01-27T14:47:05.727+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"you mean {{champion:119}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Risurin","date":"2015-01-26T22:34:03.750+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"sorcery gives 40ap 15mana regen and true damage on damage (5 sec cd on champ/ no cd on turret), ruin gives 250hp and 15% increase damage to turret and makes minion kill turret faster, iron makes a team run faster if behind the tank and givesslow resist+ tenacity(without taking an item slot)+size increase (tank has more chances to eat the skillshot instead of your carries). 25 ad and 10% lifesteal feel a bit weaker if it didnt had its own refresh on kill/assist","replies":[{"poster":"Skia Asteri","date":"2015-01-26T22:58:41.005+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Risurin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=oLQ5ebMo,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-01-26T22:34:03.750+0000)\n>\n> sorcery gives 40ap 15mana regen and true damage on damage (5 sec cd on champ/ no cd on turret), ruin gives 250hp and 15% increase damage to turret and makes minion kill turret faster, iron makes a team run faster if behind the tank and givesslow resist+ tenacity(without taking an item slot)+size increase (tank has more chances to eat the skillshot instead of your carries). 25 ad and 10% lifesteal feel a bit weaker if it didnt had its own refresh on kill/assist\n\nIt is not just 10% life steal.
