Ping was normal, and I checked my internet to see if it was working. Since I kept experiencing the weird lag, I decided to close the game and reconnect. First time I reconnected, it worked, but kept lagging. For some reason I decided once again try to close the game and reconnect but this time relogging. I did so, but mid loading screen I got an error saying I couldnt connect to the server. After that error, everytime I tried to reconnect to the game was a failure and kept saying I couldnt connect to the server. I experienced a blackout this morning and now this... I don't want the game to think Im a leaver. Any help? Now I'm scared to play a game cause of this issue. I already got an honor warning for these unfortunate events. Anyway, just wanted to share my experiences. Hopefully no one else is going through this as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Metallize","date":"2017-07-02T01:04:11.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Here it is](http://imgur.com/kX7F1cB) I had a lot of packet loss which explains the weird lag. Don't mind the ping, I'm used to it xD and it normally changes from 90 - 154. Ima try to do the quick fixes and see if it gets better. Thanks for the help, Broporo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-02T00:44:33.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm, you mentioned this lag being kind of weird and having had a blackout earlier on. That makes me think that something might have gone a little haywire with the way your connection is being routed to us. Let's start by testing that by using our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) with the network logs of that game with weird lag. Take a screenshot and post it here so I can see as well!","replies":[]}]}
