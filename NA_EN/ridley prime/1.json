I can&#039;t draw, but I did think of a few things each champ might be doing at the gym.\n\n{{champion:92}} in a deadlifting contest with {{champion:122}}. Two {{champion:7}} clones sit on each one of Darius&#039;s weights, each one looking at Riven with infatuation. Darius is visibly trying extremely hard, as it&#039;s a lot of weight. Riven is deadlifting with only her sword arm, looking bored. She has both {{champion:69}} and {{champion:55}} on each weight. Cass is looking at her nails, while Kat is sharpening her blades and looking at {{champion:86}}, who&#039;s doing his signature \"holding the world up\" exercise with {{champion:99}}. Both Garen and Lux are giggling at Darius.\n\n{{champion:254}} &#039;s gloves are on the ground, and made cracks where she dropped them next to her armor. {{champion:113}}&#039;s armor and flail are nearby, and the two are engaged in a \"friendly\" boxing match. {{champion:127}}  and {{champion:51}} look on, though it looks like only Caitlyn is the only one cheering...\n\n{{champion:33}} is struggling to reach the bar to do a pull-up.\n\n{{champion:120}} is training on four treadmills at once. {{champion:15}} is on the treadmill next to him, intimidated.\n\n{{champion:126}} and {{champion:68}} are more concerned with \"upgrading\" the gym equipment than actually working out.\n\n{{champion:12}} and {{champion:36}} are having a flex-off. \n\n{{champion:105}} is waiting his turn for {{champion:59}} to finish pole-vaulting.\n\n{{champion:89}} is spotting for {{champion:80}}.\n\n{{champion:131}}&#039;s on the bench, taking a drink. She&#039;s just finished her set. No one ever spots for her.\n\n{{champion:67}} and {{champion:133}} are stretching to do some gymnastics.\n\n{{champion:102}} is angrily hitting a punching bag. {{champion:58}} holds it, looking almost like he can&#039;t hold it back.\n\n{{champion:43}} is doing tai chi.\n\n{{champion:134}} is shooting some hoops.\n\n{{champion:114}} is showing {{champion:11}} some improvements to his stance. Of course, Master yi knows these already, but Fiora&#039;s awfully close to him... he&#039;s blushing.\n\n{{champion:77}} and {{champion:2}} are arm-wrestling. {{champion:106}} and {{champion:48}} are arguing who gets to face winner.\n\n{{champion:10}} is trying to jump rope, but keeps getting caught in he wings. {{champion:103}} is next to her, making it look easy with her tails of hers.\n\n{{champion:60}} is faaaaarrrr off in the corner, making a cobweb. {{champion:121}} is hiding behind a trash can, too nervous to talk to her.\n\n{{champion:143}} sits right under the window for some sun. Wait, is she sleeping? {{champion:57}} is trying to figure that out.\n\n{{champion:119}} and {{champion:21}} are too busy checking themselves out in the mirror to be working out... {{champion:154}}&#039;s giving them a thumb&#039;s up.\n\n{{champion:14}}&#039;s arm fell off while trying to lift. {{champion:85}}&#039;s laughing at him, while {{champion:6}} helps him out.\n\n{{champion:150}}&#039;s his rage almost full, is trying really hard to deadlift a tiny weight. {{champion:201}}  and a {{summoner:31}} are encouraging him. Is that a mustache growing on Gnar&#039;s face? \n\n{{champion:39}} is balancing on a Nerf (tm) bat. \n\n{{champion:27}} is taking a big gulp of... something. Looks like he just got off the treadmill.\n\n{{champion:62}} looks like he's doing pullups with his tail... wait, no, that's his clone. The real one is relaxing on a cloud.\n\n{{champion:266}}, {{champion:110}}, and {{champion:157}} are comparing their abs, though Yasuo seems a bit distracted by Riven...\n\n{{champion:18}}&#039;s doing her best jumping jacks next to {{champion:236}} Lucian&#039;s impressed with how high she can jump.\n\n{{champion:82}} accidentally got a bunch of weights stuck to him. Stupid magnetism. {{champion:54}}&#039;s trying to help him out.\n\n{{champion:111}} is trying to swim (in the air), but it seems he&#039;s being pulled backward by some sort of magnet...\n\n{{champion:23}}&#039;s doing pushups with {{champion:22}} on his back. Ashe is eating an apple. They&#039;re both blushing.\n\n{{champion:75}} is showing {{champion:19}}  that you can never skip leg day. {{champion:56}} looks down, sad.\n\n{{champion:107}} and {{champion:76}} are both trying to catch {{champion:29}}, but have to hold their noses.\n\n{{champion:238}} and {{champion:98}} are... playing rock paper scissors? \n\n{{champion:84}} and {{champion:64}} are kicking the bags.\n\n{{champion:5}} and {{champion:78}} are working out back to back on the machines.\n\n{{champion:421}} is leading her babies in... a digging exercise?\n\n{{champion:83}}&#039;s the janitor. He&#039;s not too happy about it.\n\n\nGot any ideas about what your favorite champions might be doing at the gym?","replies":[{"poster":"rinsujo","date":"2015-05-12T18:01:18.393+0000","up_votes":58,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone must draw this.","replies":[{"poster":"gubigubi","date":"2015-05-12T20:28:58.324+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":0,"body":"holy shit \nif this was ever drawn I would never need another background for my computer for as long as I live","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"rebound2","date":"2015-05-12T20:09:40.600+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:24}} is whacking the punching bag with his lamp post.\nHe keeps getting faster as he continues.\n\n{{champion:79}} is trying to leave the gym before someone notices he's gone.\n\n{{champion:412}} is the security guard, he just hooked {{champion:79}} over to the treadmill.\nHe creates The Box around the treadmill, so Gragas can't escape.\n\n{{champion:104}} is huffing and puffing on the treadmill, he just recently stopped smoking that cigar of his.
