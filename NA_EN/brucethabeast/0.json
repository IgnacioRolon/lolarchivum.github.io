I know before it was clarified that WOOXY wasnt an issue to have and use as it doesnt really change gameplay in any shape or form aside from what you yourself are seeing. Before I make a tutorial for a friend on youtube on how to recolor skins id like to make sure im not going to get into any trouble for doing so. Anybody know if league has said anything recently on \"wooxy\"? I havent seen anything but then again after 4 years of playing,spending and working on my account id really not like to lose it over something this small. Any info helps.

You can use it, but it the automated system detects an alteration in the files and bans you, they will not unban you for it even though it was just a skin change.\n\nThat's why people use to get banned for using a certain program for skin changing and wouldn't be unbanned.\n\n\nYou don't do research and just talk out of nothing? are you sure you aren't the one who ain't paint chips all your life? cause you look very stupid right now. Shouldn't expect much from someone who couldn't even look the topic up on google before posting though. \n\n\nEnjoy the rest of your life being a dumbass.\n\n\nAnd trying to say some months later? I actually feel sorry for your pathetic ass.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
