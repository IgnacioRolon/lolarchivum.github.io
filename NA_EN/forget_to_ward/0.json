Where 144hz 1080p monitors are basically the same price as a 4k monitor. Thus the question arises what's worth more. I am leaning toward the 4k monitor, i have played league in 4k and for the most part there is no problems besides the scaling. \r\n\r\nI'd like to know if they are working on a UI scaling update for 4k? Apparently there are thousands of posts and I think it's about time riot spends 2 minutes to change the max size of the scaling. I can tell right now that they wouldn't even have to change any textures, it'd be a simple number in a draw cycle.","replies":[{"poster":"Forget To Ward","date":"2017-08-29T16:44:47.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There isin't any 4k bugs man. It's literally just making the mouse, UI bigger. It's based on a percentage, so say the max is 100, they can change that number, and it'll scale no?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-29T16:35:20.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't have visibility on 4K support, but it should be okay to use as long as it's scaled down.  Devs responded to this a little bit ago in an [Ask Riot](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/community/q/ask-riot-summoner-spells-4k-support-and-reddit), mentioning that it's not a priority right now but may fix bugs found.  That doesn't mean never, though!","replies":[]}]}
