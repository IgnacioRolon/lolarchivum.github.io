At first it said that I needed to download about 6500mb. After about 5% downloaded that number shot up to an estimated 13000mb. After about 40% the download speed decreased to 40kbps, and then zero. After restarting the client, the download begins at 0% and repeats the same series of events.\r\n\r\nI tried this several times and got the same result each time. I checked my internet and found no issues there. Still, I can't manage to get through the installation.\r\n\r\nI feel that there must be some answer for this that I am overlooking. \r\n\r\n(I'm using a 2012 model MBA 11\" running OS 10.9.5 \"Mavericks\")","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-27T05:43:15.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not being able to properly patch certainly isn't a proper welcome to League.  (๑◕︵◕๑)\n\nBased on the description of your issues, I'd wager that your issue is being caused by your patcher disconnecting from our patching servers due to an *unstable connection* to them. An unstable connection to our servers is usually caused by certain network settings that conflict with League. Our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) covers those network settings that may be causing this issue.\n\nIf you encounter further issues with this, let me know. ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"Some Pangolin","date":"2017-01-27T14:20:13.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the reply, I'll be sure to check out the connection guide. :-)","replies":[]}]}]}
