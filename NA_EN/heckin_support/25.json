I would slow Kat whenever I saw her so even if she Shunpo'd, she wasn't getting far. I would damage reduce their ADC's (Riven, Lucian, etc) as they were engaging. If Kat started her ult, I'd saved my ult just for her so now she's dancing. And then she dies.\n\n\"Get randoms to cooperate?\" Then you just ping Kat whenever you see her.

Even you admit it.  You were forced into a champion you didn't want to play (because if you have to go with your second pick, you aren't getting the champ you wanted), and then you were still forced into items specifically to give you enough time to ult the Kat so you could hope your teammates burned her down.\n\nWhen, as I stated above, they could have just been REASONABLE and allowed us to ban 3 champions per team.

I played Sona because I DID want to play her and then I realized after my first hexakill match that Sona countered kat well. So I stuck with her. I love being the healer and I love shutting out champs. If there is one champ in the game that I'm really good at shutting down, I'm having a good time. Secondly, you're ALWAYS \"Forced\" into items. You have to build the items that counter your opponents' strengths and enhance your own. How is that any different from ANY other match EVER? Your argument here is fallacious.\n\nHow many did I have a kat on my team? A few, not all of them and as with any game you have those times where you ask why enemy kat seems to be doing better than your kat. all the normal stuff.\n\nYou're trying really hard to defend this stance and that's fine. I agree that pick/ban would help much like it did in Ascension. I'm not arguing that. I'm just saying that Kat isn't as hard to counter as you've made her out to be. Yi, I find, is much more difficult to counter simply because of Alpha Strike being so strong. He's untargetable and dealing a large amount of damage and continues to do so when he stops alpha-ing. He can usually start his alpha strike before my DMG nerf power chord hits him, so then it's wasted and he still deals big damage.\n\nLast night, I lost to a team comprised of a Master Yi, a Xin Zhao, a Ryze, a Renekton, a Blitzcrank, and a Sona. No Kat.\n\nthere was a Kat on my team. \nShe went 12/11/22.\n\nIt's all about team coordination. Every game. My team had poor coordination and I wasn't at the top of my game, either.

By definition, if you pick your choice champ, then are forced to play a second choice, you are playing something you originally did not want to play.

I don't think she is the biggest problem.  I do think that people who do think she is should have the right to ban her.  Hell, even I would ban her just to keep the game from going stale, because I saw at least one Kat literally every game I played.\n\nAs for your example, Yi is a bigger problem than Kat.  I said so myself.  Though maybe that wasn't in reply to you.  I forget.
