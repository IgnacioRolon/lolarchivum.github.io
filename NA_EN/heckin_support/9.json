Generally in higher elos, you do not upgrade yellow trinkets into vision wards. The cooldown is much too long to be useful and vision denial from sweepers much better. This does not all of a sudden change when you're facing Eve. The support, top, and mid all get upgraded sweepers or the stealth ward upgrade and someone just buys a pink to put down before the team fight to prevent flanks. \n\nalso did you look at the statistics?

That's beneficial to eve. Very beneficial. The severe nerfs to vision across the board is always a benefit to her because of the perma stealth. The defacto way to keep track of eve in high level play is to ward the locations she will definitely be visible, such as camps she intends to clear. Quite simply there are no longer enough wards to make this possible. Her combat stats have decreased dramatically relative to a lot of other champs within this particular patch, hence the win rate drop. However I'm still winning at a 60% clip with her, even in diamond, much better than that below diamond. I feel the dip is mostly because players have not adjusted jungling clear strategies properly with the changes made to jungle items and masteries. She basically took the same hit every champ not named lee sin or elise took as far as jungle relevance.

Now junglers can go standard sweeper and not give up a slot for stealth wards. Though the Warding Totem charge time is now 180 - 120 based on level versus 120 at all levels, you can get two charges.\n\nDiamond?

But yeah.\n\nthe deal with the teal smite upgrade is it only helped two junglers in particular. Elise and Lee sin. Those two champs never made the best use of the other smite upgrades simply because they didn't need them to be effective early. The chilling smite upgrade is op as balls and allowed champs like rek, grag, sej, eve, j4, di and a whole host of others, even picks like ww who historically has terrible early pressure to have early pressure. Effectively that item was a buff to those two champs who now picked up an extra item slot while other junglers still need chilling smite to remain effective early. Additionally since the timers for the stealth wards have doubled and you cannot buy green wards vision is almost completely lacking early in the game creating the very snowball environment we see in this patch, not dissimilar from season 2 and 3. That again was a net buff to elise and Lee. Regardless of those two seeing significant indirect buffs on this patch, other junglers are still viable to a degree its just not as close as in terms of relative disparity like we saw all this previous season where almost 20 champs were perfectly viable junglers in competitive terms. In effect there are now just 2. And then maybe like 5 or 6 others in the tier below that which are ok picks. All the devo picks fell out of viability with this patch, and everyone not named lee or elise got pushed down a tier. But eve is still a fine pick at the moment. There are better ones, but shes certainly strong enough in this patch to be viable because shes great at snowballing champs and vision changes keep her from being tracked, helping her get in position to snowball.","replies":[{"poster":"ømg","date":"2015-11-21T04:19:20.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=jaymc1130,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EyYqoYR3,comment-id=00010000000000000000,timestamp=2015-11-21T02:11:19.673+0000)\n>\n> technically 58-59 %.

There are better ones, but shes certainly strong enough in this patch to be viable because shes great at snowballing champs and vision changes keep her from being tracked, helping her get in position to snowball.\n\nI played Eve in KR Challenger I got about 48% win rate though ... but yeah. \n\nAnd what? Only Elise and Lee Sin? Nunu jungling come to mind as well because it was used in OGN (aka LCK). Also Gragas, Nautilus, and many other utility cinderhulk champions come to mind because Bengi gets Sightstone on all of them. Also if you mean early pressure by after they reach level 6, then sure Diana and WW have early game pressure. One chilling smite is usually not enough for WW and Diana to secure a kill unless they're severely overextended or very low because it's not a Nasus wither. \n\nYour comments on J4, Gragas, Sejuani needing chilling smite more than Lee and Elise doesn't really make sense. They're all mobile with CCs. I forgot when Gragas was changed from AP Mid to a bruiser, but J4 and Sejuani were definitely effective junglers before they even had chilling smite in the game. Chilling smite was always a preference and still is. Like how right now, TiP Rush will get Tracker's Knife on Lee but Bengi and Sbenu Flawless will still get sightstone with Stalker's Blade. Before the patch Rush would always get Stalker's Blade or Trailblazer on Lee but some other high elo junglers would get Skirmisher's. To see J4 with trail blazer, just watch SKT vs KOO Game 2 of the finals. \n\nViable devo picks: Tryndamere, Jax, WW, Xin. \n\nAnd at this point I'd like to say I just saw your caveat about \"viable junglers in competitive terms.\" In competitive terms ... this patch means nothing.  Your experiences in \"diamond\" NA solo queue with Eve means nothing. You cannot say there are 2 effective jungles since patch 5.22, because no meaningful competitive play will come out of pre season, when the game has changed drastically in just one patch. Competitive play resumes after the pre season, when the game is stable and more balanced.\n\nSources\nSKT vs KOO Game 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p1FLmphGuI\nTiP Rush's smurf acc: http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-history/NA1/227437374\nSKT T1 Bengi: http://www.op.gg/summoner/userName=skt+t1+bengi\nSBENU Flawless: http://www.op.gg/summoner/userName=sbenu+flawless","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CasterGilgamesh","date":"2015-11-20T23:48:29.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"she is mediocre at best worth learning to newbies but in high level play no she is not worth","replies":[{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2015-11-20T23:51:46.616+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PhantasmalKing,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EyYqoYR3,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-11-20T23:48:29.737+0000)\n>\n> she is mediocre at best worth learning to newbies but in high level play no she is not worth\n\nlol'd, Evelynn is semi-regular ban and uncommon pick at Diamond level.","replies":[{"poster":"jaymc1130","date":"2015-11-21T00:20:17.172+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dominick Destine,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EyYqoYR3,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2015-11-20T23:51:46.616+0000)\n>\n> lol'd, Evelynn is semi-regular ban and uncommon pick at Diamond level.\n\n^\n\nShes still top tier jg at high level play.
