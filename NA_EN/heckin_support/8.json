The main point is the turret doesn't do enough, fast enough. Sure the turret will take out vayne..eventually... after she penta kills your team under it because the tank tanked it for her first.\n\nIt used to be that a split push tactic could be avoided because turrets actually protected you, you could fight a 4v5 or even a 3v5 under turret. Now you only have the advantage if it's 5 man under turret, in which case the enemy just doesn't fight and split pushes the other lanes.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MakerOfFools","date":"2015-12-30T13:00:33.688+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not true lol","replies":[{"poster":"K54","date":"2015-12-30T13:20:08.237+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vayne is only champ.
