I find her to be a very unique champion who can fit very well with wombo team comps, and can fit well with almost any adc. That said, I still feel like her playstyle is a bit stale. I want to feel satisfaction, which I do when I land a great ultimate, but other than that in teamfights she&#039;s basically just going qweqweqwewqeewqewwqeqwqweqwe in teamfights. Sometimes you gotta watch what you press because the right powercord can also change a teamfight but even then she&#039;s not that much of an in depth character.\r\n\r\nIs there any plans for Sona in the future maybe?

Not a bad thing per say, just not satisfying.\n\nCould we adjust her to feel more like the Hunting Horn from Monster Hunter?  For those that dont know how it works, every button you press generates a note.  These notes can be strung together while fighting to create a tune that when finished creates a wide variety if effects based off the notes played.  This could be rewarding for players that learn to play Sona by also learning to making it feel like they are learning her instrument.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosThief","date":"2015-08-12T15:32:41.587+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"This could be incredibly complicated, but that could make it interesting.

Invoker from Dota 2. He has three orbs floating around him, which can each be one of three different colours. The possible combinations allow Invoker to have 9 (10, including his ultimate) spells. Playing on this principle for Sona - playing music with Q, W, E, and combining the effect with R - would make her feel like a mystical musician that composes and crafts powerful buffs for her team. From a counterplay perspective, it would be very interesting for the music to play a role in how the enemy could read her, and prepare for what she's about to unleash before she finishes the last note. \n\nI think there's an utterly massive amount of potential for Sona to become one of League's most interesting support, but is currently held back by an antiquated vision of her character.\n\n@RiotRepertoire do you think this is something that could be seen in the game at some point in the future?

In my mind, and Invoker style of champion that would play music in order to channel a greater spell is exactly the kind of thing Sona would need for her playstyle to incorporate the appropriate window of vulnerability for opponents to exploit while allowing her different tools to have significantly more impact.

This leaves us with a support that does more than gently drum their fingers on the keyboard, while having a niche among other caster supports (prefers large groups of allies + enemies to hit with that ult--the bigger the audience, the better) and satisfying a fantasy that her incredibly simple kit currently does not.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Neonocyte","date":"2015-08-12T21:08:08.257+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot, or at least Morello, has criticized Invoker's design quite heavily in the past, though with how tooltip heavy the game has become, they might not mind the idea much anymore. Beyond that, Invoker is a very different type of character with very different circumstances. For one, he is usually played as a mid core, though balance sometimes shifts him into support. As a mid core, he is also far more farm heavy than most mid laners in Dota. Additionally, he has very long cooldowns (15+ seconds on all Invoked skills) and can only use up to three active skills in a fight until he gets an Aghs, Refresher, or Rank 4 Invoke (Level 17). Even as a support, his tools are far removed from Sona's kit. As a side note, he has 10 abilities which can be created with Invoke (his \"ultimate\"), and three skills that are used to make his other skills and modify his stats instead of a stats level option, for a total of 14 abilities.\n\nAs for Sona, this proposal is a drastic change from her current style and unique tools, namely her heavy AOE buffs, and does not necessarily shift her more towards her thematic basis. Rhythm is a huge portion of playing an instrument, and this change would push her towards a more spammy style - the opposite of well-timed. For keyboarded instruments (as Sona's instrument seems to be based), arpeggiated chords are not necessary, since all of the notes can be played at once. Finally, Sona's QWE abilities are all entire songs at the moment, rather than individual notes.\n\nIf she were changed, I think I'd like to see more impactful buffs, better base abilities, and more focus on early game damage and ganking. The shield on W is nice, but Q and E would feel better if they gave some short on-hit buff or empowered a few auto-attacks, since they would be noticeable and usable to everyone in range.","replies":[{"poster":"Ultîma","date":"2015-08-12T21:20:41.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I was using Invoker as an example of a champion who strings abilities together in order to create spells, rather than an example of what kind of abilities Sona should have.

So why is this? I pick sona in normals to do damage and basically carry my adc through the laning phase with my oppressive poke. I also like her huge synergy with ardent censor. The three ish times ive picked sona has been with a heavy auto based team. I honestly would rather play bard than sona in ranked because he provides so much more of what i want as a player.\nI feel like sona is forced into building ap in order to be relevent, shes not like nami where you build tank and still have a great heal. \nI think sona needs to be more of an aoe support mage than a get my power chord and do half your adc's life if i build ap and nothing else tl help the team.\n\nAgain i like sona but she doesnt do enough to help the team she feels very selfish","replies":[]},{"poster":"HaugheyPuck99","date":"2015-08-12T15:19:19.486+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it might be really cool if Sona were taken in a Heimerdinger or Karma direction with her ultimate.

The rework sort of ripped that identity away from her and replaced with one time, short duration buffs.  I personally wouldn't mind if her personal power was lessened greatly to give her just more powerful aura abilities rather than these one shot buffs.  She feels really close to a magical Udyr in all you want is CDR so you can cycle through your abilities as fast as possible and weave in the correct passive enhanced auto attack for the situation rather than playing the right song for the situation to buff your allies.\n\nBards have never been notably strong without their team for them to support.  They are buffers/debuffers who use their skills to control and support zones for their allies.\nhttp://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard\n> **Role:** Bards capably confuse and confound their foes while inspiring their allies to ever-greater daring. While accomplished with both weapons and magic, the true strength of bards lies outside melee, where they can support their companions and undermine their foes without fear of interruptions to their performances.\n\nImagine if Sona had almost no solo power, her empowered auto attacks rather than being per spell cast, maybe we could have her be more like Dota 2 Invoker.  The order in which her spells are cast matters, rather than how fast they are cast.\n\nHer Q rather than being a nuke, is a larger AoE that like her old Q (pre rework Q) gives her allies combat stats aswell as gives all her allies and herself the one empowered Auto attack (new Q Aura).\n[I thought of maybe making the AoE burn enemies or interact with them somehow so it isn't 100% a support skill, but the burn would be disruptive in lane if it is like sunfire cape, and i cant think of a thematically strong debuff to go with this skill.  even skill name wise, Sona doesn't feel like a debuffing kind of character]\n\nHer W upon activating would be a small burst heal and shield to all allies inside, aswell as create a field around her that provides HP regen.\n\nHer E should just be reverted to her old E but add the AP ratios to the MS buff\n[Maybe add an AS/CDR buff that doesn't effect her]\n\nI'm not sure if i'd want to change her R, but an idea would be to make it consume power cord for augmentations (further pushing the invoker parallel)\n\n\nEdit: I just realized someone else already suggested an invoker style, i think for a music theme it might fit well, though i can understand the 'accessibility' argument.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bârd","date":"2015-08-13T03:48:48.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sona is meant to be a Musician.\n\nHow about something like this:\n\nWhen Sona casts Q, W, or E, she has a little minigame (Akin to Guitar Hero), lasting 1 second.\n\nHer Q, W, and E are replaced by High tone, Mid tone, and Low tone for the duration of the minigame.
