Only good for DPS mages that want to duel against everyone else. Even then, with how obnoxious lifesteal is, not like it really matters. \n\nFor burst mages, if the enemy survives your burst, chances are they either murderize you (ADC or assassin) or run far away that you can't even catch them to follow up (tanks, fighters, etc).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Muzét","date":"2017-11-29T23:31:13.260+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> One of the biggest culprits of this, in my opinion, is Morellonomicon.

Morello is the** only item** good enough to be rushed no matter which mage you are playing.\nThe issue isn't Morello by itself it's **the itemization**. A few months ago, I try to rush {{item:3003}} on Lux. It gave me a good sustain through the mana refund but sometimes I happened to be in a situation where my spelles were on cooldown and If I had a Morello or even a {{item:3108}} that could have helped me tremendously.\n\nTake a honest look at what AP **could** build instead of Morello. And tell me why would they rush it over Morello? It's not even grievous wounds. I mean... Why are you complaining about grievous wounds. You need to reduce your target's HP before it kicks in. **You could get rid of GW and put it on another item Morello would still be rush.** \nI even once took Morello on Swain (as a second item), I've never felt so alive with him. \n\nI'm still waiting for BBM items to come on SR so we can have some diversification.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LunarEdge7","date":"2017-11-30T04:21:58.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ToxicPrint,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=i7AMvvxq,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-11-29T22:55:29.330+0000)\n>\n> Itemization feels very non-imaginative now.\n> \n> I just wish mages had more options to chose from than Morello.\n\nThis is all that my brain can complain about.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tèrminus","date":"2017-11-29T22:56:25.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morellonomicon, Liandry's Torment, and Void Staff need to be chopped apart and reorganized.\n\nLike how Last Whisper got reworked into Lord Dominik's and Mortal Reminder.","replies":[]}]}
