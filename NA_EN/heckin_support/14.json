The only crit scaling that goes straight into single target damage is headshot and Cait pays for that by having a incredibly low base attack speed stat.\n\nMaking Ez's Q crit isn't innately horrible, but the scaling on the crit would have to be quite low.

Yes, this would encourage riskier play since he'd have to AA more, but he'd certainly still be a super safe pick thanks to his E. Remember here that Lucian is considered to be a very safe ADC and he has 50 range less on his AA than Ez.\n\n>Also, P Daddy would be the only Zeal upgrade that would be viable on Ez after this change (if it did) go through since Statikk and RFC would not work with Q since it would no longer proc on-hits.\n\nThat's not really true, those items are just good items. Other ADCs build SS to assist with their waveclear and I'm fairly certain the Ez would too. One other thing is that SS is currently terrible on Ez because of his Q. The crit on SS is tied to its source, which means if Ez procs it with his Q it will never crit. This is basically the reason why the yellow Ez build (Tri>SS>IE) fell off.\n\n>And the entire point of this change would be to make Ez do more damage,\n\nOne thing I think you're forgetting here is that Ez currently has the lowest sustained damage of any ADC. The only other champs who have mid-late game DPS simmilar to Ez are guys like Jhin, Graves and Kalista who all have far better burst than him and have a serious limitation on their DPS.\n\nIn fact the highest DPS way to build Ez is currently something like {{item:3508}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3036}} . People generally don't do this because you're basically playing a sub-par Lucian but this build significantly outdamages the blue build in terms of sustained damage.\n\nYou need to remember that strength when you talk about things like this. In terms of sustained damage, this build is pretty good already, it's outclassed but completely playable. What you're talking about in saying Q should crit fully is essentially adding an extra AA every 1 second if he took the 5% CDR in the masteries. (which he would because its value gets multiplied to insanity) In order to buff his attack speed by that much he'd need a 160% steroid, which is insane. Even that's a lot weaker though since his Q also acts as reliable poke and allows him to 'break the AS cap'. Bear in mind I'm assuming a 1 to 1 ratio and 0 base damage on his Q here too.\n\nSomething tells me that a 160% attackspeed steroid equivalent would break Ezreal.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"PeponiPoro","date":"2016-04-01T17:23:07.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2016-04-03T04:03:22.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That fucks Trinity Force Ezreal though.
