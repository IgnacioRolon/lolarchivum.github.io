She doesn't Poke/split/hyper/bully/utility better with her skills than ANYONE else.  Literally, everything she can do is out classed by another ADC.  All of Miss Fortune's power comes from the Miss Fortune player, being BETTER than the opposing ADC/Sup,  It doesn't come from her Kit, it doesn't come from her skills, it doesn't come from her numbers.  It comes from the fact that the people who play MF, are so ingrained with her play style, abilities, and matchups that they simply OUT PLAY their opponents.  Because honestly, the only people who regularly play MF are the people who \"main\" her as their ADC, and its out of loyalty and like of her character.  Not her gameplay/kit.  \n\nWhen this is the reason for her success is the lack of play and the only real players being those who main her, it is a problem.  Because anyone can pick up Jinx/Vayne/Trist and hypershred carry their team to success.  With Miss fortune, your REQUIRED to be good with her to get success.  hence her low Play %, and very slightly above average win %.","replies":[{"poster":"LaowPing","date":"2015-07-26T18:58:01.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is kind of wrong.

I think that's why most people think MF is weak, she doesn't have any obvious gimmick, she just hits hard. er early game damage is great and her mid game damage is crazy. She gets hybrid damage just for building raw AD where as a corki or an Ezreal has to sacrifice raw AD in order to go hybrid.

Also if you find the right supports to match with her like Nami, Blitz, Thresh, etc. and they know what they are doing too then you really shouldn't be in that bad of a spot most of the time.\n\nThe one thing I do agree with is that minion damage not being effected after a certain level is a huge thing that has been asked for countless times and would help out if her passive didn't go off because of it after level 9 or 11. Making her W activate her passive right away and using it as an escape has probably only saved me about 2 or 3 times so far (and this was with no minions around going through the jungle). Instead it's basically just like before in team fights but without grievous wounds and only her AS buff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Marthian","date":"2015-07-26T09:17:18.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"You fire her Q at a minion and run away as it is bouncing to a second target.
