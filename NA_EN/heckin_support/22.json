There could be copyright issues, it could be inappropriate, it could run into unforeseen problems or just be not practical for a skin.\n\nRecently we ran a voting competition for All-Stars which culminated in the player-vote for a Diana skin which is now in production. That was an interesting experiment in player involvement at a level we can plan around, but at the end of the day we have to see if it results in the best possible skin for Diana players. Personally my thought is that at all times we should be looking to maximise the player value we can put into each skin we make, and that won't necessarily be the case if we leave it up to an online competition to dictate our production.\n\nWhile that covers some of the why, I think we _could _run a competition and that it would be very interesting and fun. Who knows what the future will bring? Never say never.\n\nFinally you might like to know that we're always looking for great ideas and great artists. Plenty of skins grow from fan concepts. Also the artist of the 'Eclipse Leona', as well as the artist who did 'Daughter of the Sun Leona' and of the artists who worked on the 'Darkin Temple' all work on the skins team now!","replies":[{"poster":"Elewd","date":"2016-02-15T07:30:42.036+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think the way to avoid copyright and inappropriate stuff, would be to have internal riot voting first to select 10-20 skin art concepts then send those out to the public to vote, that way you can control what can/will be made while also avoiding any copyright problems. \nI personally am still praying and hoping i can get a snow lily zyra skin.  please ;;  or maybe just something pretty and lively instead of dark and dreary","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2016-02-15T17:37:36.413+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remember that a community run vote would statistically end in a very popular champ getting a skin in a very popular thematic.

For example the violinist Fiora skin really caught my eye, and so did the gravekeeper leona one. The sakura Zyra was also very pretty. Limiting it to internal votes wouldn't be as interesting, but you could add clauses that each submitted skin is looked at by a Rioter to make sure it is appropriate and possible (so no shower garen).\n\nEven with all the problems, you have to admit that a community run skin contest is something extremely exciting and a vast majority of players would participate. And the winning skin would definitely sell well as well. It's just one of those things that may have a bunch of issues that could cause problems, but the thing itself is still awesome enough that it should be attempted anyway. Maybe the ocean week statue would be a good comparison? idk. Imo a community skin concept would be many times more awesome than that kind of statue anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2016-02-15T19:05:10.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love contests, I think they are a fun and interesting way of engaging with players. I entered into two of the art contests run in previous years before being hired by Riot. It's an awesome excuse to go all out on a piece of art and a way to feel like you're a part of something cool. I did see in those past contests an overwhelming amount of art produced to the point where it took a big chunk of Riot's time to go through thousands of entries. I also saw a lot of anger, frustration and negative comments when the winners were announced. There were a lot of professional artists in the competition because of the popularity of LoL and the huge prizes and I can understand why a lot of players were disenfranchised by the results. So I understand why they began moving away from those kind of contests.\n\nI disagree about the assumptions that the majority of players would participate or that a winning skin concept would then sell well, there is no evidence to support that. It would be amazing if they did, but it's really not something to bank on. Ultimately our decisions are driven by one question; \"Is this the best thing we can do for players with the time we have?\" because, even if it's not a bad idea, if there is a better use of our time then it's hard to justify. The resources for a competition like that would really need to be justified, and that's why I think the All-Stars event was a good testing of the waters. So I want to see how 'Fire Diana' is received before I go pitching a community skin contest to my POs.\n\nBut all this thoughtful discussion is really helping balance the pros and cons and I still think it would be pretty fun >:)","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2016-02-15T19:22:17.337+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I don't think you can compare the Fire Diana skin to a skin contest. A) The choice of champions were limited and kinda skewed; Teemo already has many skins, and a lot of people would pick Diana over Nautilus because Diana's more humanoid (and also female, which matters for some people.) B) I know I would significantly preferred Diana to receive an ice skin over a fire skin; there are already too many skins that are fire themed, and I would have preferred ice particles, especially for her shield.\n\nThe all-star thing was interesting, but it's not deep enough for some people, including me.","replies":[{"poster":"Rendarkan","date":"2016-02-19T13:34:26.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I voted for Diana based on the time between skin releases. \n\nTeemo had Omega Squad previously and Nautilus got a Warden Skin not too long ago. Diana for me was the best candidate for a skin.\n\nI think to make it more fair and even is pick three champions that haven't recieved a skin within a certain time frame, excluding new champion releases that happened within the past say year or so and put them up for community vote.\n\nLegendary/Ultimates can get excluded as those usually get big promotional pre releases like PROJECT: Master Yi and Dragon Trainer Tris.\n\nAs far as the Diana skin goes I really hope it will either be something like Lunar Eclipse or Lunar Betrayer Diana where she embraced the sun instead.

Another major difference is the size of the audience - it's almost impossible to run a competition with multiple stages simultaneously across all regions, handling translation and collation. And that's how we'd want to do it so all players can be involved. Another drawback is that these kind of competitions don't actually involve a lot of the community and thus don't provide that much value for players. The latest YMtC actually has \"Designed by the Magic community\" printed on it and I suspect it's because there was no way of knowing that the previous YMtCs were.
