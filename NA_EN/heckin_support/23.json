Preferably one for the utility supports (Lulu, Sona, Janna, Karma). \r\nIs there a reason there isn&#039;t really an armor support item yet? I mean the frozen heart I guess, but that&#039;s more for melee, and is expensive, and nerfed.\r\nI remember there used to be an item that was like the locket but gave armor to nearby allies with the magic resist, I&#039;m not asking for that item specifically back because as I recall it was immensely strong, but I feel like the ap/utility supports need better itemization options when it comes to stuff like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Stiv1234","date":"2015-09-05T23:44:21.891+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zekes Harbinger is pretty good.
