It seems that when ever the game launches (after the pick and ban phase) it sometimes flickers and crashes my display and audio, but it always flickers and crashes when the game exits (when the match finishes), it doesn't happen when I launch the client. The freeze looks is ether black and white stripes or a solid grey screen. This doesn't happen with any other game just League of Legends.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-06T18:28:30.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn, that sounds crazy to see.

I tried that and I so far haven't had my issue appear again (after playing 2 games), where it happened after every game.","replies":[]}]}]}
