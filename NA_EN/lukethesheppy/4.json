Fine. I formally request an AMA on GD. We, as a community, have many questions regarding the direction of the game and the company, and I think it's about time they get answered. \n\nIf you agree, bump and upvote. Upvoting without bumping is a crime and is punishable by poor mystery gifts and/or Teemo junglers in your ranked games.\n\nHALL OF FAME\n\n100 Upvotes: Degleon\n200 Upvotes: Just Mid\n300 Upvotes: TBD\n\nResponse from Hate Daddy:\n> Heres the deal brother so all my Hatemaniacs can get behind this\n> \n> No but seriously, this is a fate we have kind of doomed ourselves into. We wanted a no holds barred, anything goes forum board. They claimed to give us this but in reality they didn't because its just a place where  slightly edgy things are let go but most shit is still against the rules, etc. We called them out on this, tamat had a meltdown and now this place is basically blacklisted, if it wasn't already just because of its past reputation on riots golden boy reddit where they consider GD to be cancer (which it is but so is reddit).\n> \n> Ask yourself this: do you think someone like Tryndamere is going to come here knowing full well it will stain his image just to post here? Furthermore, given the current frustration and  division  within the GD community itself, do you think they want to potentially throw themselves into this shitstorm? The simple answer is no, not right now at least. And honestly, I can't really blame them for that.\n> \n> I like Riot as a company and I think all of them, from the top down, are pretty down to earth, transparent people. But I blame them for GDs failure and mismanagment 100%. They needed to give old GD more time for starters to make the transistion period easier. They also have completely isolated GD from the rest of the boards and thats intentional, thats no accident. GD has always been their bastard child that they sweep under the rug rather than trying to fix it, they did the same thing with GD boards by separating it completely when they had an opportunity to fix it, crack down on the bullshit and just have a set direction for it, not something they go back and forth on. So while we are responsible for our own actions, the fact is Riot has never done anything to attempt to change some of GDs destructive habits and foolishly tried to preserve some of them, sending really mixed messages and with them basically leaving it to die now as lytes testing ground for stupid ban systems and r%%%%%ed smite threads, people feel shafted and outcasted by riot and thats 100% their fault.\n> \n> So what does that leave us with? Well we can do things on our end to tone some of our edgy stuff down. I am speaking from personal experience here because I know as of late, I have gone too far and I have been thinking about that a lot actually. So I am going toclean up my shit and hope everyone can tone their stuff down a tad as well. I know this isn't exactly what we wanted but if we want rioters here, thats the way we have to be. I believe we can still keep some core GD cultures in tact, but fellas, the truth is that we gotta tone it down.\n> \n> So I am going to take this opportunity to apologize for some of my threads calling people out, calling tamat and other rioters out. Most of it was troll and meant to be taken eith a grain of salt and a few giggles, but I realize now maybe thats not how they saw it in the first place. So I am sorry for that, Tamat, Riot and even you guys on GD. I have been around for a long time so I should conduct myself a bit better to be a better representitive of the community.\n","replies":[]}
