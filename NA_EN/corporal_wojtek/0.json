When I also go to play another game, my selection of the skin has switched to the base Teemo on its own (although idk if it has anything to do with it). Just an fyi.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-08-30T23:09:08.258+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the report! We're aware of the base splash improperly displaying, and are working to get that fixed up! Not sure why the chromas are defaulting back to base in each game, but I can take a look and try to figure that one out. :)","replies":[]}]}
