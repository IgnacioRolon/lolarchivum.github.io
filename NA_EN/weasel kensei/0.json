I mean its like before the rework: &quot;Hey Im jump in your face, fuck you up, jump back and this is ok because you have little or no counter and Im keep doing it till you cant farm or I kill you and either way I auto win lane. Or if you can do something about it we go even LB BITCHES!&quot;\r\n\r\nEven if you do counter her in some way, I mean youre hardly going to snowball on her since shes slippery af.\r\n\r\nIv played aginst her a few times now and the only LBs that I see that can be beat are the ones that go straight for you and you have a CC ability that can intercept her... if you dont, fuck you auto win. Wasnt part of the point of assassin rework to give them some counter play? Cause as far as I can tell for LB the counter play is the same as old LB: You got an ability that can punish her, or you dont, and if you dont, fuck you.\r\n\r\nShe does so much damage, and with so little risk to herself. Or she can play passively if youre a threat to her and good luck getting her even with a gank. Its her lane to lose. She can snowball and roam, but has a hard time being snowballed against. She even has some decent wave clear so if you try to shove, she will shove right back and roam on your roam.\r\n\r\nI think the rework missed its goals a bit, and shes a weird rock paper scissors champ that paper doesnt work on.","replies":[{"poster":"dakota saturn","date":"2017-01-09T00:04:18.068+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A few things about new LB:\n\nShe has a bunch of clunkiness to her kit now - she can't punish you in lane as easily as before and has to jump on you with a .25s delay which is enough to fire an ability or auto at her, and if she tags the wave and you with sigil, you have enough time to back off before it primes.\n\nYou have to hit her back when she jumps on you, and keep minions between you and her at all times unless you have enough mobility to dodge/break the chain.  This is the most important thing.  If you let her jump on you and don't hit her back, you will lose every single trade.  You -have- to hit her when she jumps during that .25s delay.  It used to be that you had to predict where and when she was going to W, she is much easier to hit now.\n\nHer waveclear was nerfed to 1/4 of what it was on release - it isn't nearly as good as it used to be.\n\nShe has a lot of potential to screw up.  If she hits R in the middle of a combo and you're out of range, she either has to waste her ult, or die since she can't jump back while she has her mimic R abilities selected.\n\nShe is much less useful late game than she used to be.  Champs with hard CC/displacement counter her hard late game, and ADCs can simply shoot her down during the 1.5s delay time.  The longer you can stall the game, the lower her chance is of winning, since she can't pick off lone ADCs anymore without a lot of risk.\n\nYou have to build magic resist if you feed her a kill.  Or even if you don't.  Get a neg cloak after 2 doran's rings if you're playing an ap mid, or hexdrinker if AD.  Go back if you're chunked below 70% of your max hp.\n\nShe's only good if the person playing her has a lot of practice with her combos and damage potential.  op.gg your opponent - if they have less than 50 games on her, go aggressive on her while dodging her W if at all possible.  If you can't beat her, you have to ward river, and farm by your turret with neg cloak so she can't oneshot you.  \n\nIf you don't feed her a kill in the first 10 minutes, she will probably fall off hard if your teammates aren't retarded and listen to pings/watch the map.  Pick someone who can outscale her (i.e. literally almost every single other character is more useful than her after 30 minutes).   Push objectives.","replies":[{"poster":"Weasel Kensei","date":"2017-01-09T01:44:29.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate all the tips, I did notice however that when It came to trading with her you said as I did it all comes down to REACTING to her GOING IN ON YOU.\n\nIts one sided.

She was a toxic champ cause of her kit pre rework, shes toxic now... why rework them into a different toxic champ.

They reworked the champs into a different flavor of shit.\n\nThat's the thing though - she is a champion who has a reverse powercurve through the game.  Almost every other champ only gets stronger as the game continues, while she gets weaker.  You have to play accordingly and respect her early game damage.  You can poke her down with a champ like Lux/Syndra/Xerath/Ziggs and wait for a jg gank or see if you can catch her with CC and blow her up.\n\nThat is the price LB pays for an early game domination - she has a lot of pressure to win the lane.  If you can score even a single kill on her by yourself or with jungle help, you've just significantly lowered her chance of being relevant at all in 10 minutes.  Use your gold to rush catalyst/neg cloak and she won't be able to do jack to you the rest of laning phase.  All you have to do now is make sure she doesn't get fed off bot lane.. which unfortunately is difficult the lower your elo is.\n\nI am not defending the rework - I would love for it to just be reverted, but it does open up more opportunity to trade with her meaningfully when before she could just chunk you without any chance of her getting hit.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2017-01-08T23:57:09.091+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"so you got shit on and come straight to whine about it here hmmm?\n\nI understand.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CerealBoxOfDoom","date":"2017-01-09T01:31:30.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"new leblanc can gank 2 lanes at the same time :3","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-09T00:01:34.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know what is a really funny thing to do to LB?\n{{champion:245}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:90}} \n\nBest thing ever is watching a LB dash through unraveled earth.","replies":[]}]}
