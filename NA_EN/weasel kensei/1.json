I hope you can share in my frustration when I roam to your lane as AP Ashe and I &quot;accidentally&quot; die, not to mention the mess Il make of my lane goofing off.\r\n\r\nGetting tired of people sticking their phone up there ass, then sticking their head up their ass to check their phone, and then mindlessly banning my champ when I had them in pick intent.\r\n\r\nThe number of times {{champion:63}} or another one of my pick intent champs has been banned by my own team has exceeded my number of fingers, and Im not going to bother starting to count on toes.\r\n\r\nBecause people are so damn poor, they cant pay attention, I guess we need a warning for someone banning that they are banning a teammates pick intent champ. I shouldnt have to type out dont bad x, because if they cant look at pick intent, they wont notice that either.\r\n\r\nAm I actually going to troll cause of zero attention span twits banning my champ? Probably not, but then Im not everyone. I have seen people feed cause their champ was banned. So think of this as a kind of PSA, pay a little attention. If you get to ban, just do a 2 second glance at what you team has picked. It isnt hard and if you cant do it, then your just dumb af.","replies":[{"poster":"Drehirth","date":"2016-05-15T23:59:20.595+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"sometimes your teammates know best man https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqL5ZtTFTyY","replies":[]},{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2016-05-15T23:19:20.308+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If an ally sees your pick intent and says ; \"sorry, i dont want to deal with it if the enemy gets them\" then you have no reason to be angry - they said it politely. \n\nBut when an ally doesnt say anything and just randomly bans your intended, then thats a reportable action because it is; \nA) Not communicating with the team\nB) Griefing\nC) Unsportsmanlike behavior","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2016-05-15T23:20:33.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Banning an intended pick is not reportable behaviour.\n\nRioters have said as such in the past.","replies":[{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2016-05-15T23:21:47.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EndlessSorcerer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=iTHVNE3L,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2016-05-15T23:20:33.109+0000)\n>\n> Banning an intended pick is not reportable behaviour.\n> \n> Rioters have said as such in the past.\n\nWithout saying anything to your team, yes it is. \nBy that kind of logic not respecting your lane placement is also not reportable.","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2016-05-15T23:29:52.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A player can ban any champion at any time for any reason.
