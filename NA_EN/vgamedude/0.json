Best example is professional sports like Boxing, Golf, Soccer. Many of the trainers have never achieved a professional career in their respective sport, but still they're excellent in the theory and tactics and whatever else is needed to train someone, or a team.\n\nHowever, I disagree with your statement.

To reach Diamond, you can't just 'be lucky and get by', or get carried all the way there. That's 1 step below professional players.
