Who should I pick first and why?\r\n\r\nEven if I like them both, I don't really know who to play as I see them as fun characters! If any of them isn't a good pick, any recommendations? I like champions like Ahri and these two since they seem really fun to play. What do you guys think? Let me know in here if I should pick one of them or just go for someone else.\r\n\r\nI really like champions that are mobile and good at wave clear with decent damage. I'm still a intermediate player and I just like to play to have some fun but I don't seem to have fun with champions I play already. I also want to take this a little bit serious since I want to improve my plays by learning mechanics in the game.\r\nI have read that Syndra and Ori have a high skillcap that's why I wanted to buy them.\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-02-01T21:32:46.901+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Ori is slightly better because of teamfights and Syn just got a  nerf(not too bad though).  They are both top of the mage pool though, with their overly bullying lane phases and extremely powerful ults.  Syn dominates lane and begins deleting people, Ori dominates lane and makes the enemy throw teamfights.  They both help alot, but I'd say overall it depends on the team comp and/or which one you're better with.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blue Collar Bear","date":"2015-02-01T22:16:48.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Orianna is almost always going to be better for composition. She synchronizes well with heavy diving teams that are popular right now. She also synchronizes well with a duo, such as Rengar, Kha'Zix, or even Jarvan. The reason why she syncs with Rengar/Kha is because her ball is stealthed with them, which allows for some mean combos.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RazorTS","date":"2015-02-01T21:28:55.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Syndra is very strong champ with few weaknesses, orianas ball is awkward to use and slow to move so she has counters. I would recommend picking them both and juggle them depending on matchups","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShakySurgeon","date":"2015-02-01T21:12:12.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally love Ori's ult for team fights.","replies":[]}]}
