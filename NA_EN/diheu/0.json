My fps is fine and my ping seems fine, I can see the enemies and allies do whatever they want (most likely killing me) but whatever spell key or mouse key I press nothing happens. This last for 1-2 seconds and then it responds normally. I don't really know what to do to fix that.\r\nThis has first appeared after I got a new laptop.\r\n\r\nThanks for any guess on how to fix the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Diheu","date":"2017-04-03T23:45:29.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here it is, https://ibb.co/fLHKGF\n\nIndeed I have a 2.91% packet loss which seems pretty high.\nGonna try using ethernet rather than Wi-Fi to see if it's better,\nThanks for the help.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-03T23:03:42.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anytime it looks like your champion is 'rubberbanding' or just plain ignoring your commands while everything else acts normally, there's a good chance you're having packet loss issues.
