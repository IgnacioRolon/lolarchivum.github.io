This has happened about 4 times ever since the new client was released.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan anyone help ? {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-21T23:12:05.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your update may not have installed properly and resulted in some corrupt game data.
