I don&#039;t want to sound naggy but this bug has existed for more than a year and unlike most other bugs has a 100% occurrence and is extremely visible throughout the whole game.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-17T17:53:00.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey beany, \n\nNo update on this issue.
