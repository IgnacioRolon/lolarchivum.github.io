It's honestly one of my favorite skins in the entire game next to Pulsefire Ezreal which still holds the #1 spot for me. \n\nThere is one odd thing though about Forsaken Jayce. The Q particle's lightning effect makes it a little bit more difficult to put the Acceleration Gate over it. It's so easy to do with the orb particle of his other skins, but something about the lightning particle just makes it harder. However it is something that you just have to adapt to. I got used to the timing and placement again, so I'd rather not sacrifice the awesome particle, but I did have minor issues with it with my first couple of times playing the skin.","replies":[]}]}]}
