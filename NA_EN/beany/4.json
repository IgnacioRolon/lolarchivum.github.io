I'm not 100% sure how much is lost in between the export and the upload, but it definitely exists. \n\nThe Soundcloud upload doesn't need a video to be attached to it, so their conversions are much less and it's closer to the native export of the track. \n\nHope that makes sense!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"semipriceysoap","date":"2017-08-17T21:43:09.747+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Battle Boss login is up, actually!\nhttps://soundcloud.com/leagueoflegends/arcade-2017-login-music\n\nGalio login should be coming shortly as well. :)\n\nStar Guardian to come in the upcoming weeks (after it goes onto live).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Engelin","date":"2017-08-17T21:50:51.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/aGvM5Rn.png","replies":[]}]}
