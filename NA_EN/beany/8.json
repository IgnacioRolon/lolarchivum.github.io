It&#039;s extremely obvious on his classic skin. Forsaken jayce doesn&#039;t have this bug because the weapon was designed without 4 states (melee, melee charged, range and range charged). Thanks for looking into this, i really want to use his other skins without having this permanent eyesore.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-15T20:36:46.939+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey beany,\n\nWould you happen to have a screenshot of this?","replies":[{"poster":"beany","date":"2015-09-25T09:50:19.882+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh sorry for the late reply. The bug is more or less the \"default\" state of all skins except forsaken jayce. You can see what's wrong with the current look by contrasting it with his ability preview on his champion page. I hope that despite the late reply, this bug will be fixed. Thanks!\n\nSpecifically, try using his R and then autoattack a minion on live, then check his ability preview for the transform spell to see what it SHOULD look like.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-29T18:09:24.362+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Okay, [this](https://vid.me/fV2c) is what I'm seeing when I load in with Jayce. \n\nIt appears that there are particle indicators for melee, melee charged, range and range charged. If I'm understanding you correctly, you're referring to the lack of animation that accompanies the particles, as noted in the ability preview?","replies":[{"poster":"beany","date":"2015-09-29T18:18:57.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're referring to the lack of the hammer \"closing\" after performing a charged attack' i.e on live it has that weird gap without the electricity, then yes.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2YuyBZ_zMU\n\nheres what i think you're referring to? at  0.49 mins his hammer closes after the attack. His cannon is supposed to shrink a little as well. Note that this issue only affects all skins except forsaken, since forsaken has a special design with his hammer, or at least i think its intended.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-29T18:36:44.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, we're on the same page. Just wanted to make sure we're talking about the same thing. \n\nThis is something Champion would be handling (I'm on skins). I'm currently in the process of talking to them and figuring out how this broke. For context, this isn't a top priority bug, as it's not gameplay impacting. However, we'll work to get the issue resolved.","replies":[{"poster":"beany","date":"2015-09-29T18:39:35.504+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks alot for your time!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Boyahda","date":"2015-09-29T18:26:21.668+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a really old bug and yes the animation is not working. When switching Jayce to melee form the hammer expands and emits energy (particles?) which indicates that his next auto attack is enhanced. When expending the auto attack the particles go away and the hammer is supposed to return to it's normal uncharged state (closed?) but it remains in it's charged state (open?). Here's two screenshots from the ability preview:\n\nHammer uncharged\nhttp://imgur.com/bhm172K\n\nHammer charged\nhttp://imgur.com/o8IraDO\n\nNote that this is happening in the cannon form as well but it's far more subtle and due to the fact that most Jayce players are in cannon form 90% of the time it's not surprising that people don't notice this.\n\n I hope this isn't too confusing.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-29T18:41:21.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, not confusing!
