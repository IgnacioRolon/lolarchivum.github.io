However, PROJECT yasuo still uses the thick blue line.\r\nRepro steps: 1. go into game as  high noon, blood moon or classic yasuo and charge q to third stack, observe range indicator.\r\n2. do the same for Project yasuo, but see how range indicator is different from his other skins.\r\n\r\nI know yasuo used to have the thick indicator before it was changed, so it is probably an oversight that you missed project yasuo.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-30T20:59:27.139+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nThanks for the report!
