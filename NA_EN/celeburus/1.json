In the third tale in the story, titled &quot;Three sisters ask Ornn for help&quot; Three sisters(Definitely Averosa, Serylda, and Lissandra) travel to Ornn.  The reason for finding Ornn is they wish to ask him to help them slay creatures who have terrorized their tribes.  Ornn refuses to slay the creatures, but when asked if he could build a trench, he agrees and, with his spade, dug a large trench, and from the trench winds blew that gave off an otherworldly howl.  This trench is most definitely the Howling Abyss.  Years later, the sisters returned, changed by war.  The third sister addressed Ornn this time, asking if the demigod would teach her how to make a unbreakable bridge.  Ornn scented magic in the third sister, and he says **magic always makes sturdy things weaker,** but, after being shown star fallen metal the sisters had, agreed to building the bridge as long as he did it alone and was paid with the metal.  And so he build the bridge, and left with the metal.  As he left, the Third sister(Lissandra) walked the length of the bridge, muttering strange incantations.  These incantations sealed the beats into the abyss. But, as Ornn said, magic ruins strong things, and so, because of this enchantment on the bridge, the Metal of the bridge will slowly weaken. \r\n\r\nThe thing I find Cool about this is how on our Howling Abyss map, we can literally see the effects of the magic ruining Murder Bridge.  As we play, parts of the bridge collapses as well as bridges in the background.  This is a really cool connection between the game and lore, and props to Riot for this.\r\n\r\nMy last question is: If the Murder Bridge collapses from the effects of the magic,  does that mean the Frozen Watchers will be released from the abyss?","replies":[{"poster":"FauxSchizzle","date":"2017-08-09T14:00:13.792+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"You connected the dots accurately.
