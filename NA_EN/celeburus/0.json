{"poster":"Celeburus","date":"2016-08-01T21:42:18.397+0000","title":"Runeterra Timeline?","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":30,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can I get a timeline of Runeterra&#039;s canon events please?","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-08-01T22:34:44.322+0000","up_votes":115,"down_votes":0,"body":"_We don't have an official one, but I'll be damned if I'll let that stop me! Here's one I cooked up from what we've gotten so far. Keep in mind though that some of what I'm listing here is based on conjecture as some of the historical details are muddy and difficult to place given other information (Gnar I'm looking at you):_\n\n- **Beginning of the universe:** Universe is born. Various celestial entities are birthed in to existence and set about doing various tasks that help form the early universe. The entity that would later be known as Aurelion Sol is one of them.\n\n- **Period of millions of years:** Life develops on worlds across the cosmos. Eventually sentient life emerges from this. Primitive cultures begin to pop up on planets.\n\n- **Runeterran prehistory:** The Targonians, a mortal civilization that has managed to leave its home planet and inhabit other worlds is met by Aurelion Sol on Runeterra. They give him that name and a crown which they then use to control him, and from then on develop in to a massive space faring empire. Targon leaves Runeterra behind but keeps watch over it. It remains unclear whether Targon originated from Runeterra or elsewhere in the cosmos.\n\n- **Pre-human Runeterra:** Darkin and demons exist on Runeterra in a different form to how they do now. At some point the Darkin are reduced to five members. Brackern come in to existence at some point and live in an isolated environment in what would become Shurima. Presumably beings like Anivia also emerged in this time period.\n\n- **Earliest point in human history:** Primitive humans mark gravestones with the twin masks of Kindred. This is both the first time Kindred appears in human history culturally and the oldest known record of human civilisations ever existing.\n\n- **Magelords and Protectorate conflict:** Conflict between two factions; the Magelords and Protectorate occurs. Evidence indicates these are among the first if not the fully established human nations. Aatrox appears for the first time in human history and changes the course of the war.\n\n- **Reign of the Watchers and the iceborn:** primitive human societies have spread across Runeterra by this point, with Freljordian humans being contacted by a race of beings known as the Frozen Watchers. They transform the humans in to the immortal iceborn and have them build an empire for them. Valoran is engulfed in an ice age, indicating this time period lasted thousands of years (remember ice ages aren't seasonal, they're literal ages. We're in an ice age right now). Eventually iceborn rebel against the Watchers in a huge civil war and claim the empire as theirs and theirs alone. Later the iceborn devolve in to civil war called \"The War of the Three Sisters\". The end result is that the iceborn's overarching leader Avarosa is killed, Lissandra goes in to seclusion after corrupting a tribe of humans and Serylda's fate remains unknown. The iceborn eventually die out as they cannot procreate to create new iceborn - their children are human. The Freljord returns to the state it was in before the Watchers arrived thousands of years before.\n\n- **Founding of Shurima:** The empire of Shurima is established in southern Valoran. Other nations exist at this time, such as Icathia. Presumably Rammus first entered the cultural eye at this time, and would remain a part of Shuriman culture even past the empire's fall, though his origins remain unknown.\n\n- **Rune Wars:** new human nations appear across Runeterra and come to discover \"World Runes\". The power of the runes leads to devastating magical wars that sunder the planet and decimate entire continents. Shurima was involved, but how we're not sure. Many nations were destroyed by the wars. The Brackern see the wars occurring and decide to hibernate to avoid death.\n\n- **Aurelion Sol, Sun Disc and Summoner's Rift:** At some point the Shurimans built a huge Sun Disc which led to the creation of the Ascended. During its construction a major conflict emerged in northern Valoran between two un-named factions. This conflict is what presumably led to Summoner's Rift being in the state it is currently in. At a similar time Aurelion Sol was called to Runeterra by the Aspect Pantheon to seal a void rift at Mount Targon. This is the first time there seems to be inner turmoil within Targon. \n\n- **Amumu:** At some point Amumu came to be. All we know is it was before what's next as Amumu is referenced in history at the time of Nasus and Renekton being human.\n\n- **Nasus and Renekton:** these two are born at this point and become Ascended later in their lives. \n\n- **Shurima vs Icathia:** a conflict erupts between Shurima and Icathia, culminating in an army of Ascended warriors taking the battle to Icathia's door. Icathia's presumably done void dabblings at this point, and here Ryze kills his master and claims his scroll to continue the duty of hiding away the World Runes. \n\n- **Fall of Shurima:** because of the plans of Xerath, Shurima as an empire collapses. The capital is blown beneath the sands, the lineage of emperors is presumed dead, and Renekton and Xerath are buried in the tomb of the emperors. Nasus goes in to exile and the Shurimans become nomadic or live around deltas and oasis's. \n\n- **Reign of Iron:** Northern Valoran is filled with warring tribes and eventually one man, Mordekaiser, manages to become an undead revenant and raises an empire of his own. It lasts for hundreds of years before an alliance of tribes and the actions of an unknown thief bring down Mordekaiser. His skull is brought to the Blessed Isles.\n\n- **Ruined Kingdom:** A king in a long forgotten kingdom is stricken with grief at his wife's death. His general Kalista goes to the Blessed Isles to find a way of saving her and eventually the betrayal of Hecarim and the king's grief cause the Blessed Isles to become the Shadow Isles. Maokai is turned in to the twisted treant while Thresh, Hecarim and Kalista all become trapped in the Black Mist. The Ruined Kingdom's fate is unknown.\n\n- **Founding of Demacia and Noxus:** Unknown which came first, but they came to be after the birth of the Shadow Isles. Poppy and Kled both exist at this time and become a part of their respective nation's history. Noxus is founded on Morde's old castle - the Immortal Bastion.\n\n- **400 years ago:** The ancient technique of shadows is sealed away by the Kinkou on Ionia. \n\n- **Sion:** Sion kills Jarvan 1 during a conflict between Demacia and Noxus. Sion is then re-animated through necromancy to terrible effect. He is later sealed away because of how uncontrollable he is in this state.\n\n- **Mordekaiser and the Shadow Isles:** At some point Mordekaiser is re-animated on the Shadow Isles and claims it as his own. This occurred _at the very least_ 50 years before the events of Shadow and Fortune.\n\n- **The Harrowings:** Several Harrowings target the Serpent Isles, specifically Bilgewater, over the course of fifty years. These are not the only Harrowings to have occurred but they're the ones focused on Bilgewater.\n\n- **Kusho and Jhin:** Kusho, the Eye of Twilight, incarcerates a serial killer named Khada Jhin. The trauma invoked from seeing Jhin's works scars Kusho, his son Shen and adoptive sons Zed mentally.\n\n- **Order of Shadows:** Reeling from Jhin's horrific murders Zed begins to loose his edge of training, and tries to find new ways to prove himself, finding the box that the shadow techniques were sealed in. He is banished and years later returns, killing Kusho and properly establishing the Order of Shadows. Shen becomes the new Eye of Twilight at some point and rebuilds the Kinkou Order after Zed decimates it. \n\n- **Noxian Invasion of Ionia:** Noxus invades Ionia with the intent of conquering completely. This invasion continues for several years and thus far has not been stated to have resolved entirely yet, though it is known Ionia repelled Noxus in a major way at some point. Many Ionian champions are influenced by this event. \n\n- **Swain:** with the aid of LeBlanc and some trickery involving Jarvan IV Swain manages to take control of Noxus, becoming the Grand General. \n\n- **War in the Freljord:** Ashe and Sejuani, after having built up their forces, go to war for the Freljord. Lissandra allies with Ashe as part of a ruse. This war has yet to end and is actively ongoing with no clear victor in sight.\n\n- **Shurima's restoration:** Cassiopeia's betrayal and Sivir's blood lead to the return of Azir, Renekton, Xerath and the Shuriman capital. \n\n- **Burning Tides/Shadow and Fortune:** Miss Fortune tries to kill Gangplank in a major assassination but fails. Gangplank is assumed dead despite this and Bilgewater descends in to chaos. Illaoi tests Gangplank and he then goes in to hiding. A Harrowing occurs and Illaoi repels it with the power of Nagakabouros. This isn't too long after Shurima's restoration.\n\n- **Bird and the Branch:** Taliyah hears of Azir's return and decides to return to Shurima from Ionia. This is roughly a year after Shurima's restoration.\n\n- **Bloodline:** Nasus and Xerath meet in Verauka, Sivir and Taliyah meet Nasus, Sivir escapes in to the desert, Nasus prepares to confront his brother Renekton, and Taliyah goes to Shurima (the city) to confront Azir. It's not too long after Bird and the Branch.\n\n_That's as much as I remember to stick in one timeline. I'll maybe add to this later if I can remember more. If people are dubious about this timeline just talk to me and we can discuss, because I'm probably screwing this up somewhere and I missed a lot of smaller details because ordering those tiny details right now is super complicated and awkward. This is just a brief overview as far as I can see it. _\n\n_FYI I didn't include Gnar stuff because yordle stuff is too weird right now to place that - for all we known Gnar could've met the Frozen Watchers during a period of time before humans were even a thing. _\n\n_I'd go back and edit for a few things I missed but I'm literally on the verge of the character limit for this post. Might do a more extensive boards post with timeline musings another day though._","replies":[{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2016-08-01T22:48:13.387+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"what the actual fuck\n\nmy left mouse button is broken because of upvotes that I spammed.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-08-01T22:52:39.170+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"I spend too much time on the lore of this sodding game.\n\nIt may not seem like it now but come december I'll prove how stupid my chronicling has become.","replies":[{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2016-08-01T22:54:10.620+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sharjo,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=jKME9AAU,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2016-08-01T22:52:39.170+0000)\n>\n> I spend too much time on the lore of this sodding game.\n> \n> It may not seem like it now but come december I&#x27;ll prove how stupid my chronicling has become.\n\nAnd then I say I know lore \n\n*cries in a corner*","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-08-01T22:58:07.280+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't cry child, at least you have an existence beyond this.

It must've happened before they made the Iceborn courts and froze the world. The Watchers themselves could originate from the era of innately-magical Runterran races scuttling about everywhere too, now that I think about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-08-02T13:13:01.801+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, after thinking on it for a while, I think that the creatures that yordles descended from (Gnar's mega form) evolved during Runeterra's pre-history, and Gnar's encounter with a Frozen Watcher occured during pre-human Runeterra. I've entertained the idea that the Frozen Watcher's were among Runeterra's more primitive and early sentient life forms who later entered solitude for eons before humans developed in to proper societies. We don't know what Runeterra's climate was like back then, only that where Gnar encountered the Watcher it is now a jungle. It might've been commonplace for Frozen Watchers to be around that area back then. I'm imagining a prehistoric Runeterra where the first sentient lifeforms developed from the beasts and land itself, leading to creatures like the Brackern, the Frozen Watchers and the Stranglethorn (Or whatever Zyra's plant species was called) developing and claiming territories for themselves. Ecological shift and the emerge of more complex organisms of flesh and blood led to the eventual downfall of these species in their own ways. \n\nEither way I'm imagining yordles in Gnar's form lived in pre-human times, and developed in to societies earlier than humans, but remained secluded and insular despite their unique position in the world. Perhaps they, like the Watchers, had hidden themselves away deliberately for whatever reason. Something darkin related perhaps? Speculation for another time I suppose.\n\nEither way I feel that yordles in their modern form have existed for as long as humans have at least, and probably for a bit longer. Given the legends about Amumu being potentially a yordle I assume that yordles were known to human societies for ages before hand as myths and legends, and became known fact only later. \n\nAll speculation on my part but the tl;dr is I think yordles became as they are now a bit before humans became as they are now, and Gnar dates back to pre human times.","replies":[{"poster":"Marbelara","date":"2016-08-02T13:42:38.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You put it into words better than I did ;w; Thank you!

We know that Ryze was in Icathia with his master when shit hit the fan, and we know that the Ascended went and battled on Icathia's doorstep in a major war, leading to the idea that the events are linked together and certainly after Aurelion Sol's short story Twin Dawns. \n\nPlus the Void is a universal threat. Just because Icathia dabbled in it and pretty much ruined south western Shurima forever doesn't mean that Void Invasions didn't happen before then.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-08-02T15:34:01.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, I read the Sol's lore once again and it seems you're right. I really thought the Void threat may have been caused by World Runes and Rune Wars, but from Sol's lore, it seems it is indeed quite universal.\n\nBy the way, do you think Runes and Targon are related in any way?","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-08-02T15:38:08.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd assume that the World Runes are sort of the coalescing of natural magical energies in to a more physical form over thousands and thousands of years.

Back on a Tahm speculation thread a long time ago I posted my idea on the origin of Tahm's name, it being taken from the gambler he conned and everything. I later deleted it but Trident SPQR brought a Rioter's attention to it citing me and everything. Anyway I was wondering weather this became cannon or not cause I remember seeing it on your TLDR:2015.
