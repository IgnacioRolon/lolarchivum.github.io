So, recently I've noticed that in every game I play, right after champion select, my game would sit at the champion select screen. This has caused me to lose games, and have had many punishments because of this. Can anyone help? I'd rather not get banned on an account for something I have no idea of.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-06T23:05:57.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When your transition from champion select to the game, your network has to establish a connection to the game server.
