It is VERY noticeable too and you won't be too starving for mana with the new flask.\nPoacher's new replacement is wonderful and is a better form of Ranger's, really.\nStealth wards won't be missed since you get two on your trinket to start with.\nSotO won't be missed...\nTwin Shadows was... sometimes used. o.o By supports... kinda?\nZehpyr shall be missed for those hour long games and you still got some boots, but you could use some shiny CDR and attack speed. Also, RIP SuperSpeedPony.","replies":[]}]}
