After getting carpal tunnel from playing this game so much, I had to take some time off. After a break, I couldnt perform in ranked as well, I was too rusty. I dropped elo, and stopped playing, expecting to decay a little, but Id still end up plat at the end of the season. \nFast forward 2 months, I get an email that I have been banned for using cheats. Immediately I try and log in, and I cant. My password has been changed, and I didnt do it. I email riot about it, asking for help with account recovery. I got a virus a couple months ago, so I am assuming the hacker chose to steal my lol account, given I was quick to lock down my bank and paypal. Looking at na.op.gg for my account it is very obvious that whoever is playing on my account is not me, the summoners are bound backwards, his champ pool is vastly different, and on riot's side they should be able to see that my account is being used on a different IP. \nAfter explain all this to riot, pleading with them, they still \"stand firm on their chose to ban the account.\" \nWHAT? I GOT MY ACCOUNT STOLEN, THE THIEF USED THE ACCOUNT TO CHEAT, AND I AM THE ONLY ONE GETTING PUNISHED.\nI have spent years, and every speck of my allowance and small funds I could get from yard work jobs to buy skins and champions the moment they came out. This account has over 1000$ spent on it, and Riot just does not care. They are taking the most important thing that I have put my time into over the past years of my life because somebody else STOLE IT FROM ME, and then used that to cheat. How is that in any way my fault? I have NEVER used any hacks or cheats on that account, and I have NEVER shared the login details with others. This account means a huge amount to me.\n\nTL;DR my account got hacked, the hacker cheated on it, the account got banned because of it, and riot wont help me regain control of my account or lift the ban, despite the ample proof I have provided.\n\nThis is a low level account I made a while ago, its the only one I can still log in to.  \nI have a PDF of the entire email exchange, I can share with any RIOT employee that would like to see what the exchange comprised of.","replies":[{"poster":"Lew","date":"2015-11-13T19:52:50.367+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"Sounds more like a case of you sharing the account with someone and they were boosting it for you with scripts...","replies":[{"poster":"mirageofpenguins","date":"2015-11-13T21:21:13.437+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":3,"body":"This is accurate, thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Hestia Esdese","date":"2015-11-14T02:35:44.416+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wait.

Alright we'll give it back to him at level 1 with no champs KEK\" so yea, you're fucked bro, go to a different game if you're pissed off at Rito Games or you can buy another acc. If rito is reading this shit fix your system up brah, because if you don't then I will LEGIT PAY a hacker group to shut down the servers because you guys aren't doing jackshit to save us, as you can see I'm pretty angry, I need to be calm *breathes* ok yes, uh yea rito fix that shit thx :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"GodofBunnies","date":"2016-07-09T03:01:19.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't played on my main account for like 2 years, only got a few games in with my aram account. Then in april this year I got an email said my account got a chat restriction for verbal abuse. Well, that is strange because I wasn't playing for so long. Then I tried to get on, of course my password doesn't work. I used my email to recover my password, and submitted a ticket asking riot to get rid of that chat restriction, and they more or less gave me the automated reply. I was like alright no big deal, but everytime I logged on, the chat restriction was just too depressing, so I never played anygame on it. then around may or so I lost access to my account the second time, this time recoving password via email doesn't do anything (as in no email). So it looks like the password was changed too. I reply riot email (as a way to update the older ticket regarding my account got stolen and trying to get the chat restriction lifted) to have them reset my account email back to the original. Then a few weeks after that I was perma banned for hacking. I asked riot for helps, and they said my fau;lt for sharing my account out. \n\nhere are a few points I want to make: \n1/ if I was sharing my account out, I am sure as hell not gona share it again right after the 1st chat restriction. \n2/ I made plat playing just teemo and mordekaiser, so I am not gona lose 7/8 of the matches on my rank placement match (if u played it before, u will know most of those games are pretty easy)\n3/ The fact that my account was stolen was clear 2,3 month prior to my perma ban. So the only way that was fake is that I planned on getting my account banned, which make no sense. \n\nso my account was still perma banned. alright. Then I was thinking to myself, having my account hacked the 1st time makes some ense since it could have been my close friends who know my usual passwords pattern and could have guessed my password, or a hacker brute force it the 1st time, but when I guess it back, the password is now obviously much stronger. And yet it was stolen again, so it is like some hacker really want my account (it does have like every cham and almost everything a person may possibly want unlocked). So I thought to myself and googled my summoner name hoping to find proof that it was stolen in a whole sale manner and sold like credit cards are being sold. So yeah I was looking for a  list of stolen lol accounts that may contain my summoner's name in some way (as u can see, my summoner's name is pretty unique). Well, I didn't find that, to my dismay there was a hacker gloating about cracking my account. I sent that to riot and that is what it takes for them to lift my perma ban (the 10 games chat restriction was now 25). So if u ask me, Yesssss THAT WAS SOME STUPID MIRACLE LUCK LEVEL, I mean accounts are typically hacked on a wholesaler level (at one point I had a list of credit cards hacked by a single hacker and that list was no less than 20,000 lines long - and no, I never used them), so one would expect the list of stolen lol accounts be just as big, and to have the hacking gloating about a single account, that was just plain dump luck. \nhere is the link that I found when I googled my summer's account. \nhttps://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:LEJ2HqBj92EJ:https://www.nulledblog.com/topic/168298-i-logged-onto-a-nulledcr-cracked-league-account/+&cd=10&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us\n\nso before u badmouth a player about lies when their account got stolen then perma banned. I, remember that it is possible for hacker to simply crack our account. It is very obvious if the ban was from boosted elo when most of those hacked game were losses\n\nOne more thing, it is impossible to put spyware on my computer because I got deepreze installed on it when my windows was installed fresh, so anything short of targeted hack (think Anonymous ddos you tomorrow for laugh and giggle - yeah it is possible, but not gona happen) will not get my password from my computer (as in if I download in infected files, or visit porn site will not result in any malware on my hard drive). any my password is a string of random character and numbers so it was not smartly guessed. it was not guessed, it was not stolen by key logger, then guess what the is only 1 remaining possible outcome, from riot (riot? Target hacker? That is a very real possibility - and I hope nobody at riot will have the audacity to come out here and say their system is hack-proof since nothing is) . The only reason your account wasn't hacked is your anonymity, yours is just one among many millions, so the odd of you waking up tomorrow and found it stolen is the same as mine. \n\nhttp://www.dailydot.com/esports/jason-shane-duffy-league-of-legends-hacks/\n\nThis article just reinforce my belief. Sorry for the typo and if some sentences makes no sense, I got really emotional when I rote this comment because you got no idea what it is like when your account is ripped from you by pure hacking and you get perma banned for doing zero thing anyone can possible fault you for (didn't share log in, top notch security, very strong  password). I mean what else can riot ask from player, or it just come down to, sorry kid you got banned because u were unlucky enough that the hacker took your account from our database instead of someone else, just blame it on your luck. Even thought my ban is lifted, it still evoke a lot of emotion when I see someone else in the same situation. I wonder what would have happen if some hacker take a rioter's lol account for a spin.
