Whenever I try to start LoL and try to log in I always get the \"Attempting to reconnect'' error message. I found out that reinstalling the game fixes this, but I'm only able to play one match, after that the error cycle continues.\r\n\r\nI also used to have an solid 100 FPS, but nowadays I usually get very low FPS when I'm like 10+/- minutes in game.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone encounters the same problem as me? Or maybe knows how to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-08T23:32:36.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think reinstalling fixing might just be a coincidence, and the actual culprit here may be an unstable connection.  These issues that you're experiencing are leading up to a complete disconnect from the game server, so it's super important to resolve that first.  It's very likely this will tide over to fix everything else.  :D  The steps in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide should help fix that up, just be sure to do it in a custom game!","replies":[]}]}
