But when I enter the actual match everything freezes: The clock, the ping, the level up signs, and my champions don't even show up. The worst part is I can't get out of it with the normal \"Tab Alt\" keys, and the only way to get out of this is to shut off my entire computer. What is going on and how do I fix this? I have tried restarting, shutting down, fixing my league client, fixing my hard drive, and repairing my league. The only thing I haven't done yet is the uninstall and reinstall method. Can someone please help me so I can play this game?","replies":[{"poster":"SonaMain MothMan","date":"2016-09-03T19:24:59.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update: I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling.
