I have several others that I thought of doing, but I figured I should see how these first few are received before I invest more time and energy into really going all out on this.\n\nThe two you see here:\n\n- The Amazing Katarina (knife thrower)\n- The Amazing Shaco (knife thrower)\n\nOther ideas:\n\n- The Amazing Braum (strongman with massive, weight-like shield with a decorated cannon in the middle)\n- The Amazing Sejuani (beast tamer - maybe a lion with a cat-o-nine-tails whip)\n- The Amazing Draven (juggler)\n- The Amazing Brand (fire breather)\n- Big Top Tahm Kench (ring leader)\n- High Striker Poppy (hammer game with the bell)\n- Soothsayer Ahri (fortune teller)\n\n\nIf I decide to keep going with this, I will be streaming my process on my Twitch channel: www.twitch.tv/monolithyk\n\nAny feedback helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Bobo113","date":"2017-01-22T00:01:09.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok - I'm going to make a few more of these over the next few days!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Friendly Ram","date":"2017-01-20T03:10:33.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sweeper shen?\nCymbal{{champion:62}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-01-19T23:27:16.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the flying talon?  trapeze artist?  dress him up like the flying graysons?","replies":[{"poster":"Bobo113","date":"2017-01-20T02:49:28.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol I think needs to happen","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2017-01-19T19:19:04.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We need the amazing warwick.
