If that kept popping up there's a decent chance that League was already running in the background. Huzzah for getting it figured out though! If it happens again in the future, make sure to check your task manager to close any leftover League processes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nitelite","date":"2017-07-13T19:22:54.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Finally loaded after 30 minutes of waiting.
