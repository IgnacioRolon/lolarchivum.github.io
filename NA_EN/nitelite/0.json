Whenever i use the Q ability \"when it charges up\" i get lag. So more or less i constantly have to guess where the target i'm Q'ing towards is going to be the moment i start casting the ability.\n\nThis issue happens with every champ that has a charged ability, but doesn't happen with champions who have a cast time. So the lag affects Vlad E and Xerath Q aswell (these are the only champions i play with charged abilities, so i don't know if Sion Q is affected)\n\nAnyone potentially understand why this happens, and how i might be able to fix this? It's been a constant issue for the last year, and i can't remember when it started so i haven't a clue what instigated the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Nitelite","date":"2017-04-19T19:16:17.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still need help with this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nitelite","date":"2017-04-16T21:19:22.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's still happening after doing that.
