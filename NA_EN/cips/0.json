It'd been a while since his last skin, and Definitely Not Udyr fit well with the April Fools' thematic we were going with. As you've seen, the skins in this set are a bit more light-hearted and fun. \n\nYou're correct in that Zac needs a skin. We keep a list of champions who are in need of skins, and we're slowly making our way through the list. For example, Akali just got her Headhunter skin after waiting the better part of three years for a skin. Zac is a special snowflake in terms of his model since it stretches a lot, so a lot of textures aren't going to look right on him. That's not to say he's not ever going to receive a skin again, but it's partially the reason why this goo guy hasn't received as many skins as Annie. \n\nTaric needs a bit of love in regards to his model before we attempt to give him a skin he deserves. Evelynn is in a similar boat. The reason she received Safecracker Evenlynn was because she fit in really well with the 'cops and robbers' type theme, and a 750 RP skin was something that accepted the limitations of her current rig and model. \n\nHope this clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Masterjlam","date":"2015-04-01T04:52:30.912+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah it's true, {{champion:154}}  it's pretty hard to work with when it comes to skins, and older champs need some rework, while others get knew looks. that's totally cool, but the fact that he hasn't got anything (skin related) since his release 2 years ago it's depressing and people who main him, like myself, still waiting for that skin to come out. I just hope it comes out this year and not next year.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mansana","date":"2015-04-01T02:57:05.191+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Special Snowflake\"...\n\nSnowman Zac confirmed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kouga","date":"2015-04-01T07:39:48.882+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've heard the \"Zac skins are too hard\" explanation over and over again, and at first I understood it. However - Riot knows what they are getting into when they design and make a new champion. They know that they will be releasing new skins, and the days of Recolors are long gone. So going into it, the team either had to say, \"Man, Zac is awesome. We'll never be able to release a skin for him, but let's release him anyway\" or they released him without considering the challenges of skinning him.\n\nI find either of these to be unfortunate. The latter shows a staggering lack of foresight, but the former is problematic as well. I'm not saying that Riot *shouldn't* green light a Champion design based on how difficult it would be to skin them, but I think it *should* be a consideration in a game where skins are not only one of the biggest revenue pushes, but also one of the few ways to \"customize\" your champion or to stand out from the crowd in some way. DotA has the cosmetic items so they don't need entire skins in the same way, but since Riot went with a Full Skin system, I find it really disappointing to see them just throw up their hands and say, \"Too hard. Can't do it.\"\n\nhttp://33.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmy4lxHghN1qlzb7ko1_400.gif\n\nI'd understand the statement that, \"Zac presents unique challenges. So he won't get *as many* skins as easier champions\" - I'm totally on board with that. I'll take quality over quantity. But come on guys - you are constantly pushing the envelope with your champions, whether its giving them crazy models or animations or game-changing mechanics. You can't set up the kind of relationship players have with their champions and skins and then go back on that. Our problem isn't that he only has a few skins. Our problem is he only has **one** and it was his release skin.\n\nI understand why Zyra doesn't have as many skins - she has a lot of things to work on. New models and particles for all her abilities? Each plant and spell, that's a lot of work. So we only have 3 skins, and 1 was only because she was in a Champion game. But Haunted Zyra was awesome.\n\nBut you can't just say, \"Zac's too hard, we *won't* do it.\"\n\n>That's not to say he's not ever going to receive a skin again, but it's partially the reason why this goo guy hasn't received as many skins as Annie. \n\nAnnie has *nine*. I'm not asking for nine. I'm asking for one or two over the next year or three.\n\nIf you are designing a champion, and someone says, \"Can we skin this Champion?\" and Riot's answer is, \"No\" or \"Yes, but its too hard, so probably not\" then I think the team needs to come to the decision to either hold off until the tech makes it easier to skin them, or to accept that they are gonna have a few challenging projects ahead of them, but commit to it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sweetie Brella","date":"2015-04-01T04:27:17.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No one remembers Yorick Mori ;(.","replies":[{"poster":"coeurloyal","date":"2015-04-01T20:58:32.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yorick is still on the Taric/ Evelynn track.

No reason to make him a skin then turn around and have to remake it for the VU. \n\nZac is a hard champion to make skins that are not just recolors. Riot wants to actually make him a good skin. Otherwise like purple Zac, no one's really going to buy it. \n\nFor how old Udry is, he hardly has a lot of skins. He too is hard to make skins for because they're all kind of the same in a way. They have to get really unique for him. Which they did for the last one. \n\nIf we're going to wonder about skins not coming out, I think Zed should be on the top of that list. Sure he got the SKT skin. But that's a limited skin and not really for everyone. He's got enough going on that they can't be that hard up for ideas or interesting things they can do for him. Lucian is on the same boat, but is newer. Jinx too. Although Firecracker was really cool.","replies":[]}]}
