You know the really sad thing? You know that even if you duo with a guy, who literally feeds on purpose everygame, afks, leaves, or just straight up trolls and you report him EVERY game.... he will never see one single big of punishment. The people he ruins the games for? They will though, they can call him out even just one time for his passive toxic behavior and they WILL be banned.\r\n\r\nRiot, you have an option, are you idiots or are you going to try to save your game?","replies":[]}
