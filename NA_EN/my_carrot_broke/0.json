[Diamond]","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":24,"down_votes":6,"body":"TL;DR     -     Just read it lol\n\nI have exactly 150 games of ranked solo queue played in season 5 right now. That's 84 wins and 66 losses, meaning that my win rate is exactly 56% as of right now. \n\nTwo days ago I started at Diamond 5 approximately 50 points, I then proceeded to win every game until 78 points in Diamond 4. This doesn't sound that impressive until you realize that I was gaining either 11, 13, or 15 League Points per win with no exceptions. That amounts to winning 11 straight games in a row. The evidence of this is attached as a picture of my ranked games match history from the League match history website. \n\nYou see that's all fine and dandy until you realize that on my 12th game, which I lost, I also lost 26 LP. That seems incredibly unbalanced and simply unfair. There should no way I should be expected to hold above a 56% win rate and on on streaks that increase my MMR that are anything even near the 11 win streak. \n\nThe next game that I won i got +19 and then -25 the next game that I lost, and then it just went back to being exactly what it was prior. HOW IS THIS FAIR?\n\nIf there is anything I'm not doing properly here, let me know, I would greatly appreciate actually being able to climb (and not relying on absolutely insane and  mostly lucky win streaks) the ladder instead of being stuck in Diamond 5 when I was floating around mid diamond 1 last season......\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: \n\n\nSome people are arguing that this is fair, yet they don't understand that I'm simply losing twice the LP that I am gaining while maintaining a hugely positive win rate, and going on massive streaks (the 11 win streak isn't the only one, I've gone on 7 and 4 win streaks prior as well, which still didn't result me in getting out of diamond 5, which is plain silly). Winning 56% of the time in a game that's designed for you to maintain a 50% win streak is a lot more significant than it seems, especially with the 150 game sample size, in which I straight up won 18 games more than I have lost. I've never complained about the clamping I experienced in Diamond 1 pre and post Master tier addition, but getting this clamping in diamond 5, where I simply KNOW that I am capable of moving ladder to something higher is just not understandable. It makes no sense to expect a player to win 3 games for every 1 that they lose in order to gain 13 LP, and then still have the risk of losing double what you gained the next game. And again, I don't have a negative win rate, this might have been a good way to allow players to improve, but I'm obviously winning more, just not enough to keep up with the silly standards. \n\n/rant\n\n\n\n\nEDIT 2:\n\n\nhttp://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Dyrus \n117W 89L (Win Ratio 57%)\nChallenger 1\n475 LP\n117W\nRiven's Cutthroats\n\nDyrus's win rate is 1% higher than mine, yet he somehow belongs in mid challenger while I apparently don't deserve Diamond 5. I got placed in Platinum 2 after promos, meaning that even if he got placed in Platinum 1, (the highest you can be placed I'm pretty sure) he should be around a tier higher than me, not 6 tiers higher than me, considering we have a similar amount of games and a similar win rate.

Think of it this way:\n\nIn a set of 20 games you win 13 games and lose 7, but since your MMR is lower than the league you are in, you gain 12 per win and lose 20 per loss, that is 156 LP from winning and -140 LP from losing, leaving a net gain of 16 lP.

If you are good enough to climb then you would have a higher than 50% winrate.  With a 70% winrate you will climb.  It just might take a while. \n\nThe system is not designed to make you climb.

I'm by no means a diamond player, but I hit mid golds and found my mmr was much lower than the average in that rank. It also explains why the system kept matching me with silver 5's and the like, while I was playing against gold and plat players. The system assumes that everyone you are playing with wants to win, which is a horrible assumption. It also assumes that half of these players won't whine/cry/rage quit the moment one, small thing does not go their way.
