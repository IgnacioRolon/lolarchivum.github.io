Still absolutely no problems at all in any other multiplayer game, and this problem only started to occur after the most recent patch. I don't see how this can be a problem on my end at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Snakzilla","date":"2017-01-26T14:37:47.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've made a post about it yesterday, got a response from the almighty Riot saying I should try their troubleshooting bullshit. Of course it didn't help not that I thought it would. But of course they're acting like the issue is on our end. I really don't know what to say about their incompetence and what's even worse is that they're ignoring the issue by pretty much telling us it's a problem on our end.

Generally, issues like high ping can be caused by connection problems either locally or even how your ISP is reaching our game server.  I suggest starting out with our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot this and rule out possibilities, then test it in a custom game.\n\nIf the issue persists, then run a traceroute to get an idea of what your routing is like to the game server.  Do this by downloading [WinMTR ](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/)and running a trace to the server based on your region:\nNA - 104.160.131.1\nEUW - 192.64.170.252\n\nThis will help us determine if there is some obstruction along the way.

These guides, like the connection, have a high success rate of resolving issues because they cover the most common reasons for the problem instead of grasping at straws.  \n\nIn cases where it doesn't resolve the issue, it still rules out possibilities so we can move forward with investigating.
