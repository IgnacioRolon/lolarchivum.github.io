In game, my ping steadily goes up and each time it hits 174, it disconnects me. My champ will slide around the map erratically, freeze in place, and at times I can buy stuff from the shop, but I can't leave the platform. There are instances where I try to leave the platform and then everyone is invisible - minions and champs so I don't know where anyone is. Anyone else having these issues?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-30T22:37:19.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm that sounds a lot like packet loss, especially when you mention you can see champs sliding around and doing really weird stuff like jumping around randomly. Packet loss happens when parts of your connection get dropped before they reach out servers, so it can be pretty hard to deal with sometimes. Do me a favor and shoot our techs a quick [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with your network logs so they can take a deeper look into your settings to see what we could do.","replies":[]}]}
