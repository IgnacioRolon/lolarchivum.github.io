This is a little annoying because the old item set creator could hold 6 before it did that. It looks like there is more than enough room to squeeze one more item into each line without making the icons smaller. It would be nice if this could be fixed to be similar to the old creator, as I&#039;m sure some people have item sets with 6 items in a block and are super OCD about having one of them below the others :)","replies":[]}
