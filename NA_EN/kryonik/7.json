It also opens up his potential builds a bit more. Let me know what you think.Also keep in mind that these changes are made to also be compatible with the New Runes System, so depending on what is released or if I can think of any base stat changes I wanna make to him, such as increasing his base mana, these ideas are subject to change.\n\nPassive - Relentless Assault: Jax gains 3 - 12 (based on level)% bonus attack speed for 3 seconds every time he lands a basic attack or ability, stacking up to 8 times for a maximum of 24 - 96 (based on level)% bonus attack speed. Stacks fall off one at a time every 0.5 seconds after not attacking for 3 seconds.\n\nQ - Leap Strike Target Range: 600 Cost: 50/55/60/65/70 Mana Cooldown: 10/9/8/7/6 \nActive: Jax dashes to a target unit or ward, damaging them for 50/90/130/170/210 (+120 bonus AD)(+70% AP) physical damage if they are an enemy. When Leap Strike is Empowered, it gains 150 bonus range and deals 50% of the damage dealt to the target as splash magic damage in an area around him (250 units).\n\nW - Empower Cost: 30/35/40/45/50 Mana Cooldown: 8/7/6/5/4 \nActive: Jax&rsquo;s next basic attack or Leap Strike within 5 seconds deals bonus magic damage equal to 25/50/75/100/125 (+20% total AD)(+70% AP). If Empower is used on a basic attack, that attack gains 50 bonus range. Empower also resets Jax&rsquo;s auto attack timer.\n\nE - Counter Strike Range: 500 Units Cost: 40/50/60/70/80 Cooldown: 14/12.5/11/9.5/8 \nActive: Jax enters a defensive stance for up to 1.6/1.7/1.8/1.9/2 seconds, dodging all auto attacks (including enhanced or modified autos), and taking 20% reduced damage from AoE spells. At the end of the duration, Jax will strike enemies in a cone in front of him, or in any targeted direction if cancelled early, dealing physical damage to all targets hit and slowing them for 30/35/40/45/50% for 1 second. The damage dealt is equal to 50/75/100/125/150(+50% bonus AD). Each attack dodged gives a Dodge Counter that increases the damage dealt by 20%, stacking up to five times. If Jax dodges an auto attack from a champion or Large monster, the slow is changed to a 0.5/0.75/1/1.25/1.5 second stun base on how many Dodge Counters Jax has. If Jax damages 2 or more champions with counter strike, he gets a shield for 2.5 seconds equal to 50(+4% bonus health) per enemy champion hit.\n\nR - Grandmaster&rsquo;s Might Cost: 100 Mana Cooldown: 90/80/70 \nPassive: Jax deals bonus damage on every third attack within 2.5 seconds or each other. The damage is equal to 50/75/100 bonus magic damage +4/6/8% of enemy&rsquo;s max health as bonus physical damage.\nActive: Jax gains bonus armor equal to 30/50/70(+50% bonus AD) and bonus magic resist equal to 30/50/70(+20% AP) for 8 seconds.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Jaxmains/comments/6s1x5d/jax_rework_idea/ Link for subreddit thread.","replies":[{"poster":"Jazin","date":"2017-08-07T04:23:06.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"FINALLY GIVE JAX' ULTIMATE %HP DMG!\nReduce the amount of flat dmg and give him some %hp dmg on his third R procc.","replies":[{"poster":"Kryonik","date":"2017-08-07T04:26:27.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did. It has flat bonus magic damage just to keep that constant magic damage but it also max health physical damage, so its not super overpowered but its there now to deal with tanks. It hurts his burst with it just a little bit but his dps against high health targets is now way better.","replies":[]}]}]}
