The gems look like stat gems that mimic the stat shards for testing, but we also saw a 350g machine gun item and what I&#039;m assuming is Doran&#039;s Dagger. Are those two items being tested currently as potential new starting items and are they going to be added at some point this season? Doran&#039;s Dagger specifically could be a great starting item for a LOT of champions and I would love to see it.\n\nItems seen at 8:16","replies":[{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2018-11-20T07:11:30.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They might just be for testing purposes. Maybe they do something that wasn't installed properly or finished yet (like maybe this was their way to set various rune combinations without the client being updated to support them.)\n\nMachine gun looks like a new starting item they're testing, whether or not it does get released.
