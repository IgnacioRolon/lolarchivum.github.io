I&#039;ve heard a lot of pain points that people think is overpowered about Jax is how tanky he can build for building little damage. I&#039;ve also heard, and experienced, that his teamfighting is pretty bad compared to Fiora or Camille. I came up with this small rework to keep the same elements of Jax the same, but also give him a way to teamfight meaningfully and have an incentive to build more damage. Passively, Jax does insane damage, so I lowered a few things, and pushed them to be situational, like with Empower&#039;s new functionality and his new ult. I&#039;ve also upped his defenses slightly to make up for the lost defenses from his old ult. Let me know what you think.\n\nBase Health: 592.8 &gt;&gt;&gt; 632.8\nArmor Growth: 3 &gt;&gt;&gt; 4\nMR Growth: 1.2&hellip; &gt;&gt;&gt; 2\nRange: 125 &gt;&gt;&gt; 150\n\nPassive - Relentless Assault: Jax gains 4 - 12 (based on level)% bonus attack speed for 3 seconds every time he lands a basic attack, stacking up to 6 times for a maximum of 24 - 72 (based on level)% bonus attack speed. Stacks fall off one at a time every 0.5 seconds after not attacking for 3 seconds.\n\nQ - Leap Strike  /  Target Range: 650  /  Mana Cost: 50/55/60/65/70  /  Cooldown: 10/9/8/7/6\nActive: Jax dashes to a target unit or ward, damaging them for 70/110/150/190/230 (+100 bonus AD)(+50% AP) physical damage if they are an enemy. When Leap Strike is Empowered, it gains 150 bonus range. If used on an ally or allied unit, half of the cooldown is refunded.\n\nW - Empower  /  Mana Cost: 30/35/40/45/50  /  Cooldown: 8/7/6/5/4\nPassive: Every 3rd attack within 2.5 seconds of each other is Empowered, dealing 20/55/90/125/160 (+25% Bonus AD)(+50% AP) bonus magic damage to the target.\nActive: Jax immediately Empowers his next auto attack or Leap Strike. If Jax tries to Empower an attack that is already Empowered, he will Overempower the attack, dealing the initial Empower damage plus an additional 10% of the target&rsquo;s Max Health as physical damage.\nThis ability resets Jax&rsquo;s auto attack timer and gives an additional 50 range.\nIf used on Leap Strike, the Empower damage is halved.\n\nE - Counter Strike  /  Range: 300 Units  /  Mana Cost: 50/60/70/80/90  /  Cooldown: 16/14/12/10/8\nActive: Jax enters Evasion, a defensive stance for up to 2 seconds, causing all basic attacks, including enhanced or modified attacks, against him to miss. Jax also takes 25% reduced damage from all AoE abilities. After 1 second, Jax can reactivate to end it immediately. At the end of the duration, Jax stuns all nearby enemies for 1 second and deals 50/75/100/125/150 (+50% Bonus AD)(+25% AP) physical damage, increasing by 20% per attack dodged up to 100% bonus damage.\n\nR - Grandmaster&rsquo;s Might    Mana Cost: 100    Cooldown: 100/80/60\nActive: Jax shows his true worth to his opponent, gaining +50% Bonus AD, +25% AP, and +20/30/40% bonus Attack Speed for 8 seconds. During this time, Jax&rsquo;s regular auto attacks also cleave targets in front of him (300 Range), and his Empowered attacks also splash in a straight line (700 Range) and grant +20% Movement Speed for 1 second. Enemies hit by the cleave or splash take 50% of the damage dealt to the initial target.","replies":[]}
