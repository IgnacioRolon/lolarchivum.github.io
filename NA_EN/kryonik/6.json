You can't see it in client when editing them and can't get rid of it. This happens to every page I make, and it is very annoying since I always put control wards in it anyways and can't even add to this new tab. @Riot, if you could, please fix this. It is very annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"Cyadd","date":"2018-06-11T16:49:13.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can confirm bug happens for me as well.","replies":[]}]}
