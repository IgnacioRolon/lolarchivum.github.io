Like I just played a game in which I played {{champion:157}}  vs {{champion:1}} . It&#039;s already being a rough matchup for me but I solo killed that {{champion:1}}  4 times. However, my teammates just keep dying and dying and in 20 minutes enemy {{champion:67}}  had 9/2/3 while our adc had 1/5 and top lane had 0/5. The top minions are under the inhibitor turret. I tried to help them but I realized mid inhibitor would have gone if I leave. Well, I decided to surrender but those who fed clicked no. I then went AFK and then they typed all chat report {{champion:157}} for AFK. How can you report someone who has higher level than you, more cs, higher KDA? I understand that people report AFKers because they are affecting game experience, was I really affecting the game experience though? I mean if you think the game is fun you can keep playing, it&#039;s not like the game you have already ruined won&#039;t be fun without me. It&#039;s fucked anyway. Can&#039;t you just get me out of the game and let me play with someone else? Why waste other&#039;s time?","replies":[{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2017-01-16T04:59:21.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now I always play to win, but I do play to have fun. \n\nIf I'm behind, but still having fun, I will generally vote to continue the game. (Why would I stop if I'm having fun?) That isn't to say I won't vote yes, if I feel like my team isn't having fun. (though I'm usually not the one initiating the surrender vote) \n\nAnd it some cases, I find it fun to play a losing game out, even when defeat is inevitable, It becomes a contest of how long you can hold out. \n\nGenerally, I hate the attitude of people who feel like we must concede a losing match. Especially when said attitude expresses the notion that a losing game is a waste of time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Noxian Pride","date":"2017-01-16T04:46:26.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To play the devil's advocate...\n\nMy understanding of this is: They had a bad game. You didn't. Since you didn't but they did, you gave up.\n\nThis is known as \"Holding the game hostage.\" And your lack of assistance makes it so you may as well have fed, because if you afk then your team **really** doesn't stand a chance, whereas if you don't you just might be able to hold them off long enough for your team to catch up.\n\nI've won a match where we lost two inhibitors before we took even a single tower. It isn't over until the nexus explodes.\n\n(Also Intentional AFK'ing is reportable so there's that.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-16T04:18:20.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Which is worse, a bad player, or a bad person?\n\nAlso you're playing a team game, respect team decisions. As for why the surrender vote doesn't pass with 3 votes, because that extra 1 person matters too much in the 5 man vote so the tilt the scale a bit with the assumptions that a match is meant to be finished with nexus exploding","replies":[{"poster":"Buster Yasuo","date":"2017-01-16T04:27:15.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But the game is going to end in 5 minutes though.

Why playi  with 5 minutes in which you probably take 4 minutes to wait to respawn.\n\nBecause wanting to finish a game is not wrong.\n\nYou know that in soccer or football where there are matches where scores are so far apart, some players just flat out don't try anymore right? Now do you just say those who are still trying to play the game should just up their arms and walk away? \n\nAgain, wanting to finish a match, regardless of win or lose, is not a wrong at all. Victory and Defeat are outcomes, they are NOT the game.\n\nNot to mention, we should also respect majority rule: If you wanna quit, sure, vote for it. But if the vote doesn't pass, then you stay, simple. As for why it needs to take 4 Yes to pass is explained above.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-16T04:32:23.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or you can just be a good sport and try to win the game.","replies":[]}]}
