Once I do, I do my normal thing of selecting champs and banning and what not.\nHowever, once I get into the loading screen, and everyone hits 100%, something is wrong. It won't let me ALT TAB out, and its been 10min since evereyone has loaded in.\nI tried reconnecting. Same thing. Still wont let me ALT TAB out or anything. I can move my mouse fine, but nothing. \nI have also tried repairing files, but no good as well. \nThis is a brand new laptop, that I literally just opened just a couple hours ago. Does anyone know a solution or tips I can try to do? Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-20T21:16:33.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's been an issue where some players are freezing after the recent Windows 10 update.

Specifically, disabling the [Xbox Game Bar ](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) should get this fixed up.
