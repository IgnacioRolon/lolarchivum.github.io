Are you sure this is the only game and your Reform Card and that you're not leaving out anything from it? I ask this because only one report is needed to flag a game for review, and premades don't have the power to autoban someone. Not only that but people have been known to lie about and/or even edit their Reform Cards to make it look less serious than it actually is, so either this is a rare false positive, the IFS showed the wrong game or there's something you're not telling us.\n\nP.S. Everyone is responsible for their own behavior, and the \"they started it/were worse\" excuse doesn't work here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-01-08T20:39:03.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It was fine at first, but you bombed it at the end with\n\n\"VirtSCP: plz report leo for verbal abuse\"\n\nThat alone.
