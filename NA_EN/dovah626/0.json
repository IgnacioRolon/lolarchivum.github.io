I mainly played Morgana and Cho'Gath mid. I played pretty conservatively, but i still liked using their Q's to poke, try to catch someone out, or escape if needed. I also liked that they both had sustain. \n\nThe 10th anniversary stuff got me in interested in League again, but it looks like the meta has changed a fair bit. Both of the champions I played dont seem to be mid laners anymore, and I'm not sure if there are similar champions in mid lane, or if I should switch roles.\n\nAre there champions I can play safely with that have hard CC, poke, and sustain? I'd prefer a midlane mage if possible, but I'm not totally sure if a mage has all of that / fits my style of play.","replies":[{"poster":"Pumpedhero","date":"2019-10-22T03:39:54.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"uh.. if u want hard CC, poke and sustain.. he has all but sustain but hes a really safe laner, {{champion:90}} malzahar....

Most of the players have less than a week of experience and are wandering aimlessly.\n\nMeta does not even exist until you are far past 30 and into more experiences games, and it does not _matter_ until very high competitive. Low ELO you can play anything you are familiar with.","replies":[]},{"poster":"vyoda","date":"2019-10-22T18:26:25.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:103}}  Safe long-range mage assassin, can poke with Q or W, has sustain from passive, E charm (CC)\n\n{{champion:101}} No sustain, but extremely safe range and 2 forms of CC; you can take {{summoner:7}} or{{summoner:21}} for extra safeness :D\n\n{{champion:79}} Can be played mid, has sustain, can poke, tank or full AP depending on your choice, lots of CC\n\n{{champion:84}} Melee assassin, can poke with Q or passive-enhanced auto, extremely good sustain if you take Fleet Footwork runes and buy {{item:3146}} \n\n{{champion:39}} Safe melee fighter, E stun,  sustain from Q, but takes a couple games to get used to\n\n\nI hope this helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"BrokenRayquaza","date":"2019-10-22T11:34:44.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, play whatever you want.

Yes she relies on skillshots, which doesn't make her that easy to pick up, but her E is a very good reactionary cc, similar to Morgana's Q. She also has great outplay potential and a high skill ceilling.\n\nIf you want to play safer or Ahri is banned, go with Malzahar. Very safe, hard to engage on and a good gank partner, however no sustain.\n\nCassiopeia is an option as well, but requires good mana management and positioning. Pick her when you feel more comfortable with game mechanics.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WTBeGirl100EUhr","date":"2019-10-22T08:49:08.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's less important to worry about what the most common role for a given champion is than just whether or not they're good in that role.\n\nMid lane Morgana isn't common but is absolutely still a viable position for her and Cho'gath is likewise in that regard. They are both simply more popular in another lane (support and top respectively) than bad in mid lane.\n\nFor the most part, very few champions combine hard CC, poke AND sustain and even fewer are mages. For mage options you have the obvious Morgana, but also Cassiopeia. Sylas if you count him as a mage and Ahri. Of these, Cassiopeia and Sylas are both much, much more difficult than the majority of champions and right now Sylas is in an awful spot balance-wise. \n\nAs such, Ahri is the only champion I can really recommend adding to your pool. She's still not **easy** but she's fairly linear so she's not so hard either. I also don't think you need to drop Morgana or Cho'gath from your mid lane pool.\n\nEdit: Swain as well maybe?\n\nTo expand on the \"fewer are mages\" comment, by allowing other champions you can include Camille, Aatrox, Mordekaiser, Maokai and Gragas.Of these, Gragas and Mordekaiser play _kind of_ like a mage but much more like fighters, whereas Camille and Aatrox are definitely fighters and Maokai is a tank. None of them have mid lane as their primary role, but all except Maokai can viably go there in the right match-ups.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mianta","date":"2019-10-22T05:06:59.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's not really any mage that has everything you're asking for. The only mage that does is Cass {{champion:69}} but she's a difficult champ to play.\n\nKarma {{champion:43}} has poke, cc, and some sustain I guess. She's more of a support, but her AP ratios are good so she can be taken mid. She has shields and movement speed too which makes her a bit safer to play.\n\nIdk about back then, but Morgana {{champion:25}}  these days has no sustain.. played almost entirely as a support.\n\nSame basic mages that are easier to get into that offer poke and CC are Annie {{champion:1}} , Anivia {{champion:34}} , and Brand {{champion:63}} , Lissandra {{champion:127}} , Malzahar {{champion:90}} , and Neeko {{champion:518}} , but none have sustain. \n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2019-10-23T18:25:57.822+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some I'd recommend would be the following: \n\n{{champion:127}} Good poke and CC with an ultimate that can heal her if self-casted as well as decent mobility with her claw.\n{{champion:90}} AoE Silence, good root with ultimate that can also deal some damage to tanks via Null Zone (his former W), and the Voidlings let him go a more hybrid style of build with the Hextech Gunblade {{item:3146}} item.
