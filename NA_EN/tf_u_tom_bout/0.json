I changed my password as of Sunday and was able to login. I'm now trying to login again and have come across the same issue. The password I'm entering is correct and when I am attempting to get the password reset link sent to me it is not coming through (this just worked Sunday mind you). Also attempted to have my username sent to me and no luck getting an email still. I created a help ticket with riot and the only way I can access it is through logging in with my account info which is not registering in the system seeing as I've had the same account information for almost 4 years now. Ticket #30380423.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a smurf account that allows me to login just fine and has no problems. Nobody has been playing on my account so i don't think it has been stolen. I would just like to know where this ticket stands and also an explanation as to how this happened 2 days in a row when I've never had a problem before.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-24T22:11:38.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This issue might be caused by something else entirely, and not credentials.

It's an easier access for someone to compromise your account, so you want to keep that stuff close and safe.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"nolife124","date":"2017-05-24T05:58:28.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'm having the same problem i don't know why its happening. it also took me out in the middle of a game.\n","replies":[]}]}
