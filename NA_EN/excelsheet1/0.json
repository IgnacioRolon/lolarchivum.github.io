His early game is painful (so I'm guessing that's part of the reason he isnt played that much).

All of his abilities are to do with \"the concept of time\" also he is one of the strongest characters in ARAM and if there were statistics for it I would bet when people get Ziliean they don't dodge in ARAM very often. That might just be you and/or your friends.\n\nThe speed up and slow down are time-oriented, his W is a time skip for all of his other abilities, his ult turns back time on an ally if they die, and his Q is a time bomb that freezes time if you land 2 of them on the same target.\n\nAlso, I agree with everyone else, the champ is incredibly boring, but to say he is not time-related at all is down-right dumb. Also, he IS an enchanter, but if there was a \"time guy\" role he would probably be in it with Ekko.

They are just running faster.\nW is a non visual \"spell reload\". And what the hell even IS his Q. It's got nothing to do with time. How on earth can you EXPLODE someone with TIME? And to top it all, Zilean literally has ZERO to none animations when casting his skills.\nAnd people DO dodge when they get Zilean in ARAM. Why do you agree he is boring, then say its a blast to play him, while you know you will be stuck with a boring champion for 20 mins without your free will?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-11-22T02:20:44.814+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Boring AF, he has one actual ability.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2019-11-27T23:52:59.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His kit is outdated and feels awkward to play.\n\nQ needs to be changed to auto cast at max range if you attempt to cast it outside max range.\n\nW needs to be changed to just be a passive; i should be able to press QQ or EE instead of QWQ, as the W press doesnt always trigger when done quickly.

You can pull off great AOE stuns, bait your ultimate, and bring a ton of utility to your team.
