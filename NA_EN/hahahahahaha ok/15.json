Here&#039;s why this will solve toxicity:\r\n\r\n1. By charging people to play league, you get rid of all the poor (which correlates with dumb) players, and also most likely wipe out the community that has to hinge on McDonalds 1000 ping free WiFi to play.\r\n\r\n2. Toxicity is self reinforcing; by getting rid of all the poor flamers, you are inherently attacking Toxicity by rich players.\r\n\r\n3.

How does Riot calculate for lottery-winning flamers that have no education vs. Ph.D carrying doctors that are incredibly nice and going through a rough spot in employment/finances?  Also, internet is relatively cheap nowadays for a fast connection.  Most people can stomach ~$50 a month for cable internet.\n\n2)  See point 1.\n\n3)  They make plenty of money in the current system.\n\nIt's been shown many times over that providing a free system with the option to buy cheap accessories (Skins, Hextech Crafting, etc.) is FAR more profitable than setting up a subscription system or fee that gates everyone behind a paywall without being able to even see what the game is like first.  Even Blizzard with the mega-titan MMORPG of WoW set up a \"free-to-try\" system many years ago (I still have little slips in the original Vanilla boxes for \"BRING A FRIEND\" with these codes) for this very reason.  They also occasionally grant \"free-to-try\" on weekends for Overwatch and Diablo 3 to let people have a taste of what they could buy to let their audience judge the game before spending their hard-earned money on it.  It's one of the main reasons games like Lineage 1 had trouble getting traction here in the West and inevitably shut down after a while, as it's difficult for someone to justify paying money for a game they could likely not enjoy with no option of returning it or trading it in for something else.  This is also why \"Demos\" have always been popular and even AAA games (like Outlast, Resident Evil, and many others) tend to release a free demo for both Quality Assurance and for people to \"get a taste\" of what's in store for them.  Nowadays there's a slew of free demos on nearly every console's online store.  Back when I was growing up, I remember specifically having the X-Box Magazine subscription JUST for the purpose of being able to get these demo discs to try out games - either that or go to one of the local stores that rent video games and try it before you buy it.  Spending full price on a game that you may dislike isn't economical for anyone other than the hyper-wealthy.\n\nYou can search for open positions and apply for a job with Riot [here](http://www.riotgames.com/careers).","replies":[]},{"poster":"zacktootall","date":"2017-04-27T00:48:02.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"here is some money for your grave........","replies":[{"poster":"hahahahahaha ok","date":"2017-04-27T16:50:25.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Gift me elder wood hec","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Silly Neeko","date":"2017-04-27T00:47:32.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone must have just been banned for toxicity.
