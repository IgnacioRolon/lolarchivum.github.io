Mathematically I&#039;m pretty sure you barred silvers from premaking with plats so how on earth do you allow them to meet in the same game? I&#039;m not even talking about solo/duo ranks, they were silver in flex. \r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe it&#039;s cause I&#039;m soloing in flex but damn riot, you had a year to figure this shit out lmao.

Most people just play solo/duo. With fewer people to go around, the range of MMR has to be widened so queue times don't get obnoxious.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThrÃ«at","date":"2017-01-24T07:10:50.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, I'm D5 in the queue and the match making is no different than when I was P5 after placements. Flex queue is not a competitive queue it is a casual queue, just treat it like it is normals.\n\nSome games I have D3-D1 on my team, the occasional master/challenger and other games I'm paired with a few golds and a plat and vs all diamonds. There is no balance in skill.","replies":[]}]}
