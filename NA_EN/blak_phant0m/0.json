The blank mask devoid of anything resembling a face in my opinion fits perfectly with a ninja, and a camera makes perfect sense.\r\n\r\nHonestly the only thing for me is the scarf color because the purple isn&#039;t found anywhere else in the model, but its faded enough that it doesnt break the deal.\r\n\r\nI just wanna say excellent work on these skins and please, please keep zeds mask so i can really be behind this skin XD.","replies":[]}
