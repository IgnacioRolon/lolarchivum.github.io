As soon as the champion select ends, and the client minimizes (I don't need it to close because usually my pc can handle it), and the game opens. Before I can see anything in the loading screen, my monitor cuts to black, and in order to continue using my pc, I have to restart it. Alt-tabbing, using the windows key, ctrl-alt-delete, nothing gets it to fix itself. I don't get any errors. I play on Windows 7 if it matters.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-26T18:42:18.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info here, it helps a lot!  This sounds like a driver our hardware could be failing, or maybe a resolution problem failing to render on your screen properly.  This can't be a connection issue, though, because it would need to be more severe to make your pc freeze like that.  My suggestion here would be to run through each step of the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to troubleshoot towards a fix.\n\nJust in case, a config reset might help as well if the resolution is contributing to the problem.\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings. \n\nTest it out in a custom game and let me know if those steps work for you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-26T17:54:58.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What are you playing on?
