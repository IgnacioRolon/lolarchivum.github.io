Its the only one in the last 20 this action was taken. It's also clear from the game stats from other games that this player, in the game op posts, was not even attempting to try to play and win. It's also pretty obvious this is not an annie player. While the account has mostly poor performances (suggesting this player is indeed just bad) that one annie game looks completely different from the rest of the games. Its clear looking at the game history that the annie game was intentionally trolled, it was not a computer issue, there is a ranked game as malphite immediately following it where the player played well and basically what I would expect of a silver level player.\n\nLooking at all the evidence I can see, it still looks to me like the annie in the screenshot intentionally trolled in this specific game, in ranked, and should be punished for it immediately.\n\nI do not tolerate that kind of behavior from ANY player, regardless of Riot employee or not. The fact it is a Riot employee who intentionally trolled this game only makes it worse.\n\nI understand my view on this is not a view shared by everyone, I am extremely intolerant of that type of toxic in game action as I believe it is the worst thing a player can do in a competitive game and I would vote to ban players after a single instance of intentionally trolling and feeding while also refusing to cooperate with the team. That is how I would handle it, that is how I handled it in the past with Tribunal, and I will stand by that viewpoint until the end of time. That type of action has no business in a ranked match, ever, and it should be met with immediate and swift punishment.

While the account has mostly poor performances (suggesting this player is indeed just bad) that one annie game looks completely different from the rest of the games.

You will find stuff like that. If I get trolled and flamed in a normal match I will straight up sell all my items for tears and intentionally feed. My gaming experience was already ruined by other players so I will enjoy my time feeding away and stacking muh tears.\n\nThat does nothing to change the fact that I have never been punished for that. I've never ever done it in a ranked match... but I will do it from time to time in normals. And if it goes unpunished in all game modes we have a serious issue.\n\nThis annie player, in my opinion, should be punished for the actions taken that game. Its clear as day that game is an aberration and was trolled by the player in question. The fact that its an aberration means the punishment not need be permanent. The fact it was clearly trolling in ranked play means it should be punished immediately. The fact it was a Rioter doing this is cause for serious concern and the employee should be notified that this is NOT the example they are expected to set and no further examples of this behavior will be tolerated or it will cost them the job. \n\nThat's how I feel about it. I have a zero tolerance policy for that type of thing in ranked play. Zero. The vast majority of the player base ALSO has zero tolerance for that type of thing in ranked play. It has no place in ranked, ever, under any circumstances, and is by FAR the most toxic thing a player can do in game. For these reasons it is worthy of punishment without question.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jaymc1130","date":"2016-01-31T00:55:14.354+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=jimlaheysadrunk,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PlEAFNPl,comment-id=00060003000000000000000000030000000000000000000000000003,timestamp=2016-01-31T00:13:02.956+0000)\n>\n> i never once said its not an issue.  this annie obviously doesnt do this often, or possible ever.  that is not deserving of a ban.  \n> \n> people who do this continually, every game, should be punished.  people who feed in retaliation continually in games should be punished.\n> \n> you cant however just start banning people who do this one time.  you just cant.  just like you cant ban people for saying fuck once.  there has to be a limit, and in a game like this, where emotions run high, there has to be some amount of lean.\n\nDoing it ONCE in a ranked game is ban worthy.

This is clearly a player who refused to participate with the team and is a prime example of how awful Riot priorities are.
