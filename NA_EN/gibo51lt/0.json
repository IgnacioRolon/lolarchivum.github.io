Vayne started inting and went something like 0/5 while flaming Soraka, Soraka got mad and started running it down mid too while flaming Vayne back. I talked sense into both of them, they both said &quot;Ok but just for you mate&quot;, they muted each other and only talked to me, they played the game well and we won the game in the end, I got 3 honors from my team.\n\nI know I did some things wrong, like using caps lock and asking &quot;are you 12 year old?&quot;, but cmon...\n\nHere&#039;s the chatlog with very minor changes to make it more clear who&#039;s talking to who (I changed words like &quot;you&quot; to &quot;soraka&quot; and &quot;dude&quot; to &quot;vayne&quot;, nothing that affects the actual conversation):\n\nGibo51lt: omg fail stun sry\nGibo51lt: cho afk\nGibo51lt: akali can snowball mid after lvl 6\nGibo51lt: kill hjim\nGibo51lt: akali you should gank mid\nGibo51lt: AKALI CAN YOU HELP YOUR TEAM?\nGibo51lt: vayne omg\nGibo51lt: 4v5\nGibo51lt: don&#039;t go afk\nGibo51lt: they hvae cho afk\nGibo51lt: vayne\nGibo51lt: you wanna get banned because of soraka?\nGibo51lt: well riot don&#039;t know that\nGibo51lt: all their algorithm see is you go afk\nGibo51lt: vayne so what\nGibo51lt: this is free elo\nGibo51lt: akali carry easily\nGibo51lt: you play to lose ?\nGibo51lt: or to win?\nGibo51lt: soraka stop flaming her back please\nGibo51lt: jsut mute her\nGibo51lt: and let her play\nGibo51lt: stop it omg\nGibo51lt: vayne and soraka mute each other\nGibo51lt: and play\nGibo51lt: for win\nGibo51lt: pls\nGibo51lt: vayne stop she&#039;s not worth it\nGibo51lt: soraka you&#039;re reported too if you troll\nGibo51lt: soraka you&#039;re no better than vayne if you do that\nGibo51lt: no just push\nGibo51lt: let her last hit\nGibo51lt: she will carry late\nGibo51lt: soraka chill\nGibo51lt: soraka chill he&#039;s not gonna report anyone lol\nGibo51lt: &quot;fck you all&quot; what did I do soraka ??\nGibo51lt: don&#039;t let vayne ruin game for the rest of us\nGibo51lt: omg\nGibo51lt: well let her say anything she want\nGibo51lt: mute her\nGibo51lt: JUST MUTE EACH OTHER NOBODY ELSE CARES ABOUT YOUR FIGHT\nGibo51lt: YOU ARE TWO RANDOM PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET, WHY DO YOU CARE OF EACH OTHER?\nGibo51lt: soraka you come league to play or to talk ?\nGibo51lt: if you come to play and have fun, then ignore vayne\nGibo51lt: I am not on anyone&#039;s side\nGibo51lt: i don&#039;t care who said what\nGibo51lt: I just want you both to be quiet and focus on game\nGibo51lt: I don&#039;t care who started\nGibo51lt: &quot;but she started&quot; are you 12 year old?\nGibo51lt: I come here to play after a stressful work day\nGibo51lt: and all I see is people fighting each other\nGibo51lt: when there&#039;s an enemy to fight\nGibo51lt: yeah and vayne also hopes you lose all games, so what?\nGibo51lt: you&#039;re two strangers online\nGibo51lt: I just hope we can play the game and have fun together and kick the enemy&#039;s ass...\nGibo51lt: n1 stun vayne\nGibo51lt: nicee\nGibo51lt: 1-3-1\nGibo51lt: nah not yet\nGibo51lt: we need one pick\nGibo51lt: then we can baron without risk\nGibo51lt: vayne we can probably, but get one pick so it&#039;s safer\nGibo51lt: 1-3-1 ?\nGibo51lt: 2-3-0 better\nGibo51lt: gg guys\n\nThere was also another game in my ticket where I did flame, but the thing is, that other game happened like a week prior to this game. What this means is that the first game alone wasn&#039;t enough to get me banned, Riot still allowed me to continue and show that I can improve. Which I did, and didn&#039;t flame ever again. Until, apparently, this chat log that I posted above. Which almost unarguably isn&#039;t flaming since I helped my team get their shit together and am the only reason we won the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot
