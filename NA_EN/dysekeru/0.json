I lost 3 devestating losses. 20LP each. I uninstalled cuz this week I lost 12/13 games. I won the next game 16/2 Hecarim. I barely gain any LP. I lose the next game and lose another 20LP. Seriously Riot. Go screw yourself. I am so freaking tired of your game. THIS IS THE MOST BS I'VE EVER FACED IN A GAME. THE MOST F'D OVER I'VE EVER HAD IN A SINGLE GAME IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. SERIOUSLY. I AM TIRED OF THE FEEDERS AND THE AFK'S. \r\n\r\nSeriously why can't I just get a replacement for people like that. We were going to win the game but this baddie twitch went 0/8 and finally just quit the match cuz he was so bad. I spend 46 mins of my life FOR NOTHING. JUST TO GET AN AFK AND TRY TO WIN 4V5 FOR NOTHING. TO LOSE 20LP FOR NOTHING. ALL MY EFFORT I PUT INTO THIS GAME??? FOR NOTHING. I'm freaking done. ^^^^ this game.","replies":[]}
