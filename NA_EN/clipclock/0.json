Due to stuff from previous seasons I was compensated 520 BE \n\nSo I started playing not thinking much of it, but as it turned out there were 2 things amiss here. Firstly for whatever reason I _never_ received the 50 BE for first win of the day either today or yesterday. Secondly there is a _chance_ of acquiring Blue Essence on leveling; I did this yesterday and received absolutely none. I did end up receiving a level, but received absolutely no Blue Essence from that either. Given the table provided by Riot Cactopus in \"Leveling and Rewards - Early Impressions and Adjustments\"(1) I should have at least received something I could disenchant into 540 Essence from that. However, what I received was a champ worth 270 disenchanted and overall a fraction of what it costs in the store. If Blue Essence should also be retroactive I should have also had more Blue Essence from previous levels or Brand and several Loot Boxes.\n\n\n*sources\n1: http://www.surrenderat20.net/2017/11/red-post-collection-balance.html#10 ; \nURLhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/hAaYMrEs-leveling-and-rewards-early-impressions-and-adjustments\nWebsite Title Boards \nArticle Title: Leveling and Rewards - Early Impressions and Adjustments\nDate Accessed: November 12, 2017\n   Discussion board written by Riot Cactopus in Dev Corner\n\nThe third and largest problem however is that Blue Essence does not scale well. Some champs cost 6300 Blue Essence; pretty much on par with what it was in the old system, but it actually takes longer to acquire Blue Essence than the old LP and you receive less overall compared to the old system wherein you could grind. In terms of measures 50 BE a day would leave you at 126 days total to be able to grind up towards this (presuming this is an intro level bot game you don't really get exp from due to you being higher level). Or in a more regular case where you are leveling up which to re-observe the table \n   Takes approximately 11 levels total for the 1 champ give or take from level 1 not including random factors of value brought about by dissolving champs, ward skins or whatever else comes out of loot boxes.\n   So acquiring a new champ takes _a lot_ more resources to actually acquire now than before in terms of time spent and reliance upon factors beyond ones own control to be able to acquire a single champ faster.\n                 Or so it would seem.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-12T22:39:15.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry about the confusion there, Cactopus might have talked about that change a bit early or didn't make it clear enough but this 50 BE for the First Win of the Day mission has not gone live yet. Make sure you read through his entire post again for the fine details!\n\n> Our plan here is to convert some of the XP from the First Win of the Day boost into straight up blue essence. At system launch, FWotD granted 575 XP. _**When we ship this change (aiming for sometime during patch 7.23)**_ it'll instead grant 50 BE and 400 XP.\n\nI did go ahead and double check what kind of rewards you got on level ups as well, and it looks like there's a little confusion as to what kind of rewards you're supposed to get. So no, that level 18 capsule didn't give you any flat BE at all. It _**DID**_ give you two champion shards though. Were you able to see how much those disenchanted for and how close that value is to the chart Cactopus posted?","replies":[{"poster":"ClipClock","date":"2017-11-13T00:25:23.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the response; sorry for the abruptness of the message.
