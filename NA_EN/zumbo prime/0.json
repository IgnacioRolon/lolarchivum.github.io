I had already owned Project Leona and her icon during the big Project event, and never ended up getting it. Only asking because I recently saw somebody who had the border.

In order to have unlocked her loading screen border, you would have had to purchase her during the first week the skins were released. Unlike the PROJECT:Disruption borders, this border was included automatically without having to craft anything.\n\nYou can find our original announcement of this event [here.](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-pbe-feedback/3qXbIdqV-initializing-project-first-strike-project-sync) Let me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Zumbo Prime","date":"2016-10-23T00:02:29.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the answer!

The first-strike boarder for Project Leona was only given to those who purchased the skin during the very first week of it's release, from 9/8 to 9/15 of last year. If you did not purchase it then, then there is no way to obtain the border.\n\nThe more recent Project First-Strike event only gave out the loading screen borders for the newer Project skins, Ashe, Ekko, and Katarina, as well as Yasuo since he didn't get one during the first Project event.","replies":[]}]}
