My internet was completely fine so the issue had to be server side. I disconnected from the game and now I'm at the queue for ranked game with no way to re-join the game i was in. How does one fix this?\n\nEdit: Apparently all 10 players that were in that particular game were kicked out of it about 9 minutes into the game and the results were not recorded.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-07T03:30:44.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like you might have experienced a game crashing server side. It's pretty rare, but when it happens everyone gets booted just like you did. Nobody will be able to reconnect, since the game doesn't exist at all anymore. No worries though, you won't get any penalties and should have been able to requeue as normal.","replies":[]}]}
