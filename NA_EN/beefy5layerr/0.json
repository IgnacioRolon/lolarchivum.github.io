Im not sure if this is one of the many (many many many many) Glitches or bugs out right now but it seems a little unfair to me that a skin can be such a game changer (Because this skin has saved my ass from a few ganks) And i do not feel this is fair to most players.\nSo rito nerf plz.\n\nRiotKateyKahos 1 month ago: Thanks for the heads up!
