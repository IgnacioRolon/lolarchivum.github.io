I get the error \"An unknown DirectX error has occurred and League of Legends cannot start. Please make sure your video card is using the latest video drivers from the manufacturer.\".\r\n\r\nWhen I play on my hundred year old 1280x1024 view sonic monitor  - I do not get this error. I can play fine. If I switch over to windowed mode on this monitor I can play in windowed mode on my large monitor. \r\n\r\nThe game was working for me in fullscreen mode on my 1920 x 1080 resolution monitor when it crashed in game and I could never relaunch at full screen on this monitor now for the last 2 days. Since the game was working on my other monitor and can be played in windowed mode on the effected monitor. I don't see how this is a driver issue - is there any way to fix this? \r\n\r\nI can't play nearly as well on a monitor that I'm not accustomed to!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-16T22:38:18.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you may need to double check for any DX or graphics driver updates just in case. Typically that type of error points to some kind of bad interaction between League and your graphics software. If that doesn't help, run a quick repair through the client options and let me know if that helps.","replies":[]}]}
