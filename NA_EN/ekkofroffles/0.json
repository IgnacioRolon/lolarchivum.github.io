Case in point, I have played 117 matches with Garen this season, and 16 were against a Teemo, with most of those insta-locks after I&#039;d already picked Garen.\r\n\r\nThe next highest total is Darius, another &quot;counter,&quot; with 9 (4-5). Pantheon, also on the list of &quot;counters,&quot; is up there too with 7 (3-4). I&#039;m not happy with my sub-50% win rates against the latter two, but in lane, where I should be &quot;countered&quot; most, I still tend to win more often than not.\r\n\r\nAnyway, back to Teemo, I see him almost twice as much as Darius and my win rate is 75% (12-4). Even more glaring is the KDA discrepancy between us. Me: 173/45/167 (7.56). Him: 133/163/127 (1.60). I average 2.8 deaths per match. He averages just over 10. 5 of those 16 matches, I was &quot;perfect,&quot; not even a single death.\r\n\r\nLike my last match, when I went against someone who, sadly enough, appears to be a Teemo main with 82 matches and a 50% win rate. I won lane handily enough to cause Teemo and Cho&#039;Gath to lane swap, finishing 9/0/0 with a double kill. Teemo finished 2/9/1. He came near killing me **once** (survived with _3 HP_), but that was only because I went in with my E still on CD, and worst case scenario we kill one another there.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s because of matches like this that I will literally beg for a Teemo when I pick Garen. At this point, I know the matchup better, and am more comfortable in it, than any other. And that right there is why counters aren&#039;t really a thing in low ELOs. As long as you know your champ well (i.e., better than your opponent knows his) and don&#039;t go in with a defeatist attitude, more often than not you&#039;ll come out victorious. Basically, at low ELO, it&#039;s more you &quot;countering&quot; yourself than anything. \r\n\r\nTo illustrate this, my absolute worst match-up is Riven (1-5). Yes, one of the champions **Garen** counters. Next worst is Nasus, another champion I&#039;m supposed to counter, at 2-4. Though that one generally goes like so: 1) I win lane 2) I roam to assist other lanes 3) Nasus farms up his Q 4) Nasus joins his team and bad things happen 5) We lose. When I see either champion, my confidence drops. Though that&#039;s partly because, with both, you can win lane and still be screwed. Riven can just go feed on your teammates, even if you ping them a half dozen times that she&#039;s missing and to be careful, and Nasus can just AFK farm his way to relevance.\r\n\r\nStill, like I said, &quot;counters&quot; in low ELOs are all in your head. With enough experience and skill, you can win any matchup. So, go ahead and keep picking Teemo into my Garen. Heck, give me a Pantheon, Darius, Kennen, or just about any of my &quot;counters.&quot; I&#039;d rather that than a Riven or Nasus who knows what they&#039;re doing.","replies":[{"poster":"Kappeerino","date":"2015-04-23T16:52:59.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":22,"body":"16 games is nothing, people play that in a day.

And when around 200 or so matches total looks to be about average for the ranked players I face, meaning you're not liable to find a sample size that big for one person facing a particular matchup, as it would mean they literally played that matchup every match, which I'm pretty sure is a statistical impossibility.

For instance, I picked up Amumu and am 8-1 with him my first 9 matches.\n\nSo, no, counter-picking with champions I don't know is not going to do a damned thing when the only champions I'm comfortable enough with for ranked are not said counter-picks.","replies":[{"poster":"T RexHasLongLegs","date":"2015-04-23T18:04:48.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Beyond that the issue is probably what you're playing. I'm not sure what you're playing top over 70-80 games but is it a bunch of different champions?\n\nEvery champion and every play style has their own best set of win conditions, as well as sort of the minimum basics to play them. I'll give ADC as an example because they tend to be more consistent, and although I don't play them (can't really) I know why and can explain it.\n\nThe minimum requirement to play adc is farming and dealing damage. If you don't cs well, don't orb walk, don't know how to use the mechanics of the kit, then you are below the level of even a bad ADC main. You can bring your ADC win rate up by just improving mechanics (my mechanics are the worst part of my game). However, to get a good win rate on ADC and carry your self up the ladder, eventually you need to learn ADC win conditions. On the simplest level it is \"position well in team fights, and push objectives after wins.\" Dealing damage is great, but what separates a minimum level ADC from a good one is their ability to position. If you're complaining about peel in bronze and silver you should look at your play and figure out position errors. Teammates probably didn't peel well, but it's bronze, that's why they are in bronze, so instead you focus on your positioning and how to deal damage while staying safe, this skyrockets your damage out put because you don't die and are continuous damage. Increased damage leads to more team fights won where you're still alive from good positioning and then you just need to take towers and win..... your job as ADC isn't damage, your job is pushing towers. You probably do it the best on the team and no one cares if you don't do damage in a team fight if we still win the fight and we are able to push down 2 towers instead of 1 because you're alive and kill towers fast. That's ADC win condition.\n\nWhen I jungle and support (if I'm playing well and really trying to climb rather than just trying to play something different bc I'm bored and don't care if it takes a little longer to climb if my team can't carry) I play Nunu and Janna. Their win condition is to not feed, control objectives (consume for drag/baron and tower/adc shield for pushing/stalling), and scale up to where they body guard whoever isn't doing terrible that game. (I may die in lane as Janna, but my overall KDA is over a 5 because I get SOOO many assists in team fights mid game since I can keep my team alive and even in a losing game we stall out, and I don't die mid game)\n\nHeimer, my main for mid and top, does massive damage, but his win condition is still objectives and towers rather than kills. A lot of games my kills will be low, but my damage to champs is high because I push people off towers and take them w/ my turrets rather than fighting for kills, or I use turrets to zone at drag and they do damage but no kills because I want the objective and will worry about the kills after instead of before. My win rate on heimer is 65-70% over about 75 games this season, not because he does damage and carries, but because he drops towers, and when my team is struggling I can rotate to that lane, drop their tower, and then our jg can help the lane bc we have a tower and the enemy doesn't which is a huge advantage.\n\nPick a few champs and learn them the best instead of spreading out. You don't need to counter pick to get out of bronze, you need to learn to play one champ even half way decent for at least 3 or 4 roles (and one has to be support, if you aren't comfortable on at least one or two supports don't play ranked) and play to their win conditions. Don't play a role you aren't comfortable with (most cases people will let you support if you can't play a carry role for a particular lane) and don't play a champ you aren't comfortable with when you can play one you know really well.","replies":[{"poster":"EkkoFroffles","date":"2015-04-23T20:40:55.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Garen, Wukong, and Malphite primarily. But the light switch just flipped on for my for Darius, so he'll be joining those ranks. Likewise, I see Lissandra joining them to increase my variety with some AP and CC.\n\nIn general, I've tried to keep my focus to a select few champs for each role, ones I know the \"win conditions\" for as you put it. For jungle, for example, I played nothing but Amumu for a couple days before taking him to ranked. My 8-1 record with him shows that was wise. Took the same approach with Naut support and won my first match going 0/8/23.\n\nMostly, though, it's all about finding champs I'm comfortable with. If I don't feel truly at home with a champ, no amount of practice will make me as much of a threat with them as with one I do. At the very least I want them to be fun so the grind of learning them isn't dreadful. Like Lee Sin. It'll be a while before I take him to ranked and can make LCS plays, but he's the funnest champ for me and even needing to improve with him I can still do some things. But with Sion, for instance, he's such a dumpster fire in my hands, and I hate him so much, that I don't feel like even bothering.","replies":[{"poster":"T RexHasLongLegs","date":"2015-04-23T22:39:16.659+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"See how you like Liss, if you like her I'd recommend trying to improve and main her. You can get the mechanics down and play mid OR top w/ her and that gives you a much better chance of playing the same champion frequently so you can focus on getting really good with her and getting out of bronze if you want to.\n\nIf you're good w/ amumu you have my support to run him every jungle game you can. I love that little guy, but my initiations on him have been pretty bad this season and I'm 0-4 on him I think lol. His hard engage is good in almost any team if you can avoid getting counter jungled and killed early, and you don't engage when your team can't follow up (IE if you flank them and your team is close that's great, if you bandage toss in and lock them down for the perfect engage but your teammate were even just slightly behind you and they had blown their gap closers recently and had them on cool down then not so great bc they have to walk and miss the chance to drop damage during your cc.)\n\nMy suggestion, and I hope you take this as being helpful and not an insult, is that you improve your support. I win a decent number of my support games and I think I was like 9-1 with annie support in bronze 3 when I started the season down there. A good utility support can make a bad team okay and an okay team good. 4 man tibbers stun wins a lot of team fights late game and something like janna can make your team really hard to lock down and kill. Your support win loss ratio is by far your worst so if you can position better and help your team better (also maybe look at common warding spots and think about the objective you are going for next and if the common spots you want vision for that objective have it yet or not and then warding BEFORE you go to the objective. Not warding in advance of starting to try something is a really common mistake I see) then you should see LP gains.\n\nLastly, think about your Garen builds, pure damage can be bad, but building decent damage w/ your tank items on Garen is often better than just going straight tank. W/ his silence and some damage to go w/ being a massive tank your ult can often drop a squishy like a fed adc before they get out of the silence. Dropping their biggest threat while still being tanky enough to have some hp left to stick around the fight makes team fights easy for your team. Other than that I'd suggest sticking to Darius and Garen (plus liss when you add her) unless you love the other two. I'm 4-1 w/ malph this season and love the champ, but part of why I win with him is because I usually pick him as a counter pick. If they don't have a lot of dashes his ult is great and q slow is pretty strong. Most importantly though is that if they have a jg or top who relies on attack speed plus the adc malph is probably 10 times better than if they just have casters and an adc. His AS slow as a counter pick is a HUGE difference in his strength in any game. Similarly I like Wu in any game w/ a yasuo, or something that is pretty wombo combo like wu, amumu, ziggs/kennend, and i dunno, like alister support or something. Other wise he's kinda a weak top right now, and while that might not matter much because a modicum of skill w/ even a bad champ can outweigh meta strength in bronze, if you're struggling to gain LP in low bronze reserving Malph and Wu for more situational picks, and realizing wu is probably better in the jungle than top right now may help you climb. Also as fun as Lee Sin may be, you probably don't want to play him except in normals. Honestly a good mechanics lee sin who uses the kit right could probably be pretty bad at everything else and still make gold, but because he is so strong w/ good mechanics he is balanced for that and is kinda weak if your mechanics aren't good. If you're low bronze then you just don't have the mechanics probably (a lot of gold players probably don't honestly) to make him worth playing given how they have to balance him. Lee's win rate is pretty bad in low elo, it's because of his balance. Play other stuff and get your mechanics on that better and when you hit high silver or low gold MAYBE consider picking up Lee. If you don't have the mechanics to get to that elo at least (and realistically probably high gold/plat mechanics are what you want) then lee just isn't worth playing when you could play something easier. If you like the mobility check out stuff like reksai, kat, lb, nid, ez, kass, and probably most importantly since you main top and I didn't see it listed, IRELIA. She is really strong top and has a huge power spike w/ trinity so you can start doing work early in the mid game which is huge in mid/low bronze bc if you can roam and snowball early a lot of teams start raging and fall apart if they get behind early.","replies":[{"poster":"EkkoFroffles","date":"2015-04-23T22:58:11.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I loved Lissandra from the first time I played her. It's just a matter of getting consistently good with her. My personal test to see if I'm ready for ranked is usually to see if I can keep up a high level of play for at least three straight matches with that champion. With Malz, for example, I held my own in 4 straight matches, with two being dominant performances and 1 showing that I can come from behind, as I think I started 0/3 to Vel and worked my way to 8/9/3 in a match when myself and our Jax top were the only real threats. So, in short, I need to play Liss some more before I'm comfortable making the leap to ranked.\n\nBut I'm that way with a lot of champions now. Been working a ton to improve my versatility and that has meant trying tons of champs. Gone through all the free ones the past couple weeks and bought a ton. And I can only really devote the proper attention to one champ at a time. Yesterday it was Malz. Today Liss. Tomorrow probably Leona, with some more Naut, even though I played nothing but him for days at first.\n\nAs a result, champions like Irelia have been largely forgotten about. Her, Jarvan, and Panth are ones I know I could probably excel with if I put my mind to it, Jarvan especially, but since top has been the least of my concerns they've fallen by the wayside. Shyvana's another possibility, and she can jungle too. Those are the only ones left that I really see myself doing well with. Unless I practice Shen or Hec a run or end up loving Kennen or Diana whenever I get the chance to play them.\n\nRek, Nid, and Ez were all busts for me. LB seems to have a somewhat high skill cap too, though I can actually not make a fool of myself playing her like I do with Zed. And Kat's yet another champ that's on my list to practice.\n\nWith regards to Garen, unless I really need the added tankiness, I tend to buy IE, BC, or both and find that, with the crits on his E, are enough. Especially when I get fed pretty often.\n\nOh, and support is definitely one of my top priorities now, since it's either I get top or jungle or am stuck supporting. Working on my mid too, though, so it's not \"top and jungle are taken, so support it must be\" every time. And knowing that I can do well with Graves in the event that I'm forced to ADC, which jas only happened 3 times in 218 matches kind you, is comforting as well. I can stop saying that if I ADC we will likely lose now. Heh.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AFK Push","date":"2015-04-24T05:50:28.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wukong is an amazing top, he can easily win the game for you from a good teamfight and some roams.

If she plays safe and farms, she'll eventually outscale Garen, but if Garen can stop her comboing with his Qs and bully her enough early on, then Riven's in a bad place.\n\nLiterally all I had to do my last match against her was Q her whenever I saw her start up her combo, E her, then step away and go back to farming. Rinse, repeat until I had an opening for a kill. But I stupidly let her roam without tagging along and my teammates fed her, even with fair warning.

These \"counterpick websites\" are also retarded in my opinion, people like you and me can comment there. I will tell you that i have played this matchup from both sides quite often, and while Garen has the advantage in early trades there is nothing he can do to stop her from farming and he defintiely cannot kill her if the Riven just focusses on csing, Now I know from my days in Bronze back in Season 3 that no one ever thinks about csing while laning but only about getting kills, so thats why the Riven in your matches might try to engage onto you and then yeah..get silenced and lose the trade. But if the Riven just plays carefully and gets cs there is nothing Garen can do about it, he has no kill pressure or the potential to bully her like for example a Renekton has.","replies":[{"poster":"EkkoFroffles","date":"2015-04-24T22:13:22.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Diamond 2 ( http://www.lolking.net/guides/294971 ).
