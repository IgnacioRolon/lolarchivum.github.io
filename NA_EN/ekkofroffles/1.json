And Ekko is basically just all my favorite things rolled into one champion, most likely another unpopular opinion.\r\n\r\nLeast: {{champion:36}}{{champion:75}}{{champion:19}}\r\nI own two skins for Mundo, including a legacy skin (Toxic Dr. Mundo), but if you asked me to name the most boring kit in the game, I'd say his. His ult just makes him and his HP regen faster. His E is just an attack steroid. His W is basically just a Sunfire Cape. And his Q, the bulk of his damage, is a skillshot. Nasus is the ultimate AFK farmer, which gets old fast. Then there's Warwick, reduced to the AFK farmer of the jungle whose only worth is his ult, which isn't even that fearsome anymore.\r\n\r\nAgainst...\r\n\r\nMost:\r\n{{champion:114}}{{champion:86}}{{champion:17}}\r\nFiora and Teemo because I love seeing people get all worried about them, only for me to curb stomp their squishy heads in. Garen because I like testing myself against other Garens.\r\n\r\nLeast:\r\n{{champion:107}}{{champion:92}}{{champion:35}}\r\nRengar and Shaco are the best at popping out of nowhere and deleting people. And Riven... well, I wouldn't mind her so much if people didn't feed her virtually every time I'm up against one.\r\n\r\nWho would you pick?","replies":[{"poster":"Lv99RougeRogue","date":"2015-05-22T02:51:48.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shaco's ability to gank through lane is terrifying, and riven is just plain annoying no matter what.  While mundo's kit is simple i also find him extremely fun to play. We need more champions with simple kits. There's nothing complex about him and there aren't really any surprises, but it's really easy to be bad as mundo. Its also rewarding when you're good. I'd say the only thing that mundo really needs is greater item diversity in the game, but that can be said about pretty much any champ.","replies":[{"poster":"EkkoFroffles","date":"2015-05-22T03:28:32.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm fine with simple kits, seeing as Garen is my main, but Mundo's is not just simple, it's boring... **and **I suck with him. So those two things combined make me hate the guy.","replies":[{"poster":"Lv99RougeRogue","date":"2015-05-22T21:40:33.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I'd say garen's is a tad bit more complex due to timing on W and Ult and knowing when to use your silence. But the whole \"I suck with him\"  thing explains it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"dalekiller11","date":"2015-05-22T11:55:35.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is tricky for me, because I try to pick out fun champions to play, so I don't own many boring ones\n\nMost fun to play:\n{{champion:90}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:53}} \n\nMalz:\n Love the ulti and the space aids, a combination of picking one unlucky jerk who just doesn't get to play League today, and the fact that if you can land an \"E\" before they wander away, dazed, means that they die off in the fog of war, alone. So fun\n\nVel'Koz:\nThere has never been a more fun ultimate than just blasting somebody out of existence with a purple laser. Thats it. you have won life.\n\nBlitz:\nFor those who have not yet experienced the pleasure of picking off an unsightly Yi, dragging him through a wall and into the throng of your waiting team have not yet lived life to the fullest. I recommend you pick him up (if you don't own one of the most recognisable champions in League) today.\n\nLeast fun to play:\n{{champion:16}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:20}} \n\nSoraka:\nWith a kit that stands with only one surefire poke, a heal from your own health, and the hardest to hit stun ever, this champ is one you should save your Ip on. Even if she's just 450.\n\nGalio:\nHe's just not fun. I have seen him a total of zero times in all my normals, playing him once, then never looking back.\n\nNunu:\nAlthough an incredibly viable jungler at the moment, his lackluster abilities are not especially fun to execute when all they involve is a slow, then an auto to death. Then tank. Meh.\n\nMost fun to play against:\n{{champion:67}} {{champion:432}}{{champion:80}}  \n\nVayne:\nLike most Vaynes, the one you're probably playing against is incompetent, especially at a lower elo. Wathching them waste their ult is one of the funniest thing you can see on the rift.\n\nBard:\nI love chasing this guy. I had one dude make a portal, try to use his ult on me when I got out, and snare himself. It was Awesome.\n\nPanth:\nThe Ult. It's the easiest thing to dodge in the game. Aside from that he's actually fairly good at the moment.\n\nLeast Fun to play against:\n{{champion:9}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:17}} \n\nFiddle:\nThe fear lasts FOR EVER.\n\nLeBlac:\nI imagine people who main here as sadistic, evil, Puppy slaughtering jerks.\n\nTeemo:\nI don't actually have to explain this do I? I mean really?\n\nThank you!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-05-22T02:19:22.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As:\n\nMost: {{champion:69}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:268}} \n\nI love some late game ap hypercarry, and cassio and azir also provide a challenge to use, while being very rewarding if you play them well. And about eve, I just love all her theme, the stealthy femme fatale. \n\nLeast: {{champion:25}} \n\nMorgana is very boring to me, mainly because she has long cd and is very simple to use.\n\nAgainst:\n\nMost: {{champion:4}} {{champion:6}} \n\nTF is a nice opponent who can put a lot of pressure in the side lanes with his ult, nevertheless, he is not that oppresive. You gotta play careful against Urgot, he has strengths but clear weaknesses aswell, I think they are both very balanced.\n\nLeast: {{champion:238}} \n\nLet's face it, he is just not fun to play against. He has amazing wave clear/splitpushing, he has burst, poke, he is energy based, he can sustain well once he gets a cutlass. He has mobility, counterplay pontential, dive potential, etc. If you are one of those hypercarries you are not going to have a pretty time against Zed.","replies":[]}]}
