DC issue where you can't reconnect!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Everyone,\r\n\r\nJust had a (normal) match where I DC'ed, and got booted to regular client screen and couldn't reconnect into the match. (There was no \"reconnect\" button)\r\nSo far I've seen at least 2 other posts of people being DC'ed. \r\nI don't know if I was the only one that got disconnected from the match, or the whole match blew up. I have no idea if people will report me, since they don't know that I can't reconnect, but really wanted to.\r\n\r\nMy internet connection wasn't interrupted, so it wasn't that. I've experienced quite a few disconnects lately at all hours of the day while no one else was using the internet.\r\n\r\nIt would be really great if Riot would actually reply to this, or any of the other posts that cover the same issue so that we may actually know what the issue is.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nH33P","replies":[{"poster":"P3NANC3","date":"2017-08-27T23:15:30.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My apologies.

Hence it might not be as much of an isolated incident as suggested.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-27T22:54:11.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oooooh trust, I've been making my way downtown through the boards seeing these as well.
