In case I can't lock in a champion \"I have left champ select\" despite that there is nothing I can do.\r\n* Other times the 'disconnect' bar appears in game despite my ping being normal, nothing wrong with my connection and no one else using it. I've also had the disconnect bar in a custom game, with no enemies...\r\n* There are random lag spikes almost every game.\r\n* Yesterday I had an instance where after exiting (because 'disconnect' bar) with the intend to reconnect, there is no 'reconnect' button.\r\n* The loading screen has started freezing this patch, which I notice way too late, since I never had to pay attention to it before, resulting in me joining games late. \r\n\r\nAnd of course no one from Riot is actually responding to anyone's posts on the problems they have... since I've seen posts on here regarding the various issues I've noted here above. It would be nice if Rioters responded to anything else than memes and concept art... and Yes, I've sent bug fix reports too.\r\n\r\nAt this point I don't even want to start a match anymore because of the odds that I won't be able to finish the game... \r\n\r\nIf I were to guess it's that your servers are performing sub-optimal, to phrase it politely.\r\n\r\n\r\n(PS. - I have my ingame settings at nearly the lowest possible, the client is in potato mode on a 1 year old computer with no other programs running.)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-28T00:16:07.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those disconnects likely don't have much to do with the patch itself, as it sounds like you're having problems with something called packet loss. \n\nI see a lot of these packet loss issues around Help & Support periodically, and they typically pop up when ISP's start having issues with their routing.
