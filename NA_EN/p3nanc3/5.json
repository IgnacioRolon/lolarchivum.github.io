You can goto your profile to see how many of each honor you've received, but it doesn't say if you have the ribbon for that honor type.","replies":[{"poster":"P3NANC3","date":"2017-05-19T04:39:56.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks =D\n\nThat is unfortunate, but it is not the end of the world :)\nOn the other hand, Riot will probably create an amazing experience when they craft their new honor system :)","replies":[]}]}]}
