Is there an issue on Riot's side?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-29T18:10:16.023+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like your network might be blocking you from reaching our patching and authentication servers.

I was just playing ranked Monday with no problems and this has never happened to me on league unless it was client sided. I got on today to update to patch 7.13 and now all of a sudden I can not log in to the game unless I install and use a VPN which is laggy and uncomfortable. This has been bugging me ever since the patch update. I have tried hard resetting my modem and router, changing settings in my router to have more bypass power, my firewall always stays off, Hextech Repair tool is trash and does absolutely nothing, full repaired the league client, used command prompts \"ipconfig/release/renew/flushdns as well as netsh winsock reset, changed dns servers on network adapter and router to 8.8.8.8/ 8.8.4.4... I don't know what else to do. I even read somewhere that checking Internet Explorer advanced setting TLS 1.0 could help.(I don't even have Internet Explorer and have played League just fine all this time). I downloaded anyways just to try it and still no luck. I would reinstall but that literally NEVER works for anyone, I've seen too many threads talking about reinstalls are a waste of time and it's too basic to achieve anything. If you find a fix let me know man.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-29T18:13:01.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm curious if there might be routing or ISP issue causing hiccups while trying to reach us.  While off the VPN, download [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and run a trace to 104.160.131.1.\n\nThis will give us a better overview of what's going on.
