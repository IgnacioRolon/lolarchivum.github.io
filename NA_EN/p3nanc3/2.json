Confirm with your friend, and let me know if you run into any issues.  Thanks again!","replies":[{"poster":"P3NANC3","date":"2017-04-20T05:22:00.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it was a minor bug that popped up. We were on voice chat, so made sure neither had the champs. It also specified the 'mystery champion' part, which should also not have been the problem as we have plenty of 'pool' room,but I think it had more to do with the technical side that Xayah and Rakan are \"mystery champions\" but with a 100% gift chance or whatever (hypothesis).\n\nWe were able to gift each other a bit later. So, all is well. Riot has produced some happy faces as these champs are awesome!","replies":[]}]}]}
