Its do with with getting a S on rengar.\nLast time I played rengar when I sorta gave up getting Mastery 7 was when I went 25/3 got 4 drags and a baron with 170 minions at 35 mins as jg. That was only a S-.\nMy friend tonight played rengar and went 10/3 with 1 out of 2 drags and 120 minions at 25 minutes. He got a S.\nWhy did he get a S and I only get a S- regardless of doing better in every aspect of the game.\n\nEdit: You guys are asking for assists, I was 25/3/6 he was 10/3/7","replies":[{"poster":"DoktorKaiser","date":"2016-11-05T15:29:06.374+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What are you guys talking about, wards dont impact the score at all, my friend got multiple S+ on support without buying a single ward (he is new to the game), only things that have impact are CS, KDA, kill participation (really important), barons/drakes and general stats for other players who played same champ in same position.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Awesomedude8888","date":"2016-11-05T18:19:23.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know this is just a QQ thread when OP omits the number of assists that the Rengar has had.","replies":[]},{"poster":"pandorahearts330","date":"2016-11-05T15:21:43.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wards and CS, did your friend have more assist then you?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2016-11-05T14:55:30.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wards and CS are really heavy on S score (and i think that farming should be less important because you can't steal others farm to get and S). i got an A on Aurelion Sol with 20/7/8 score with 184 cs at 41 mins and I also warded not a lot but constantly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-11-05T14:48:16.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably ward count was low or the algorithm thinks that 10/3 in 25 is better than 25/3 in 35?  idk just suggesting.
