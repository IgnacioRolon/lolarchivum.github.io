I thought it might be my internet, but today I was playing CPU games to try and test it, and after my ping spiked the game straight up crashed and closed itself. Why is this happening?","replies":[{"poster":"Firestarter","date":"2017-09-25T12:49:36.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-21T04:42:57.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eeeeee snap that's no good. Ping spikes that high can sometimes be attributed to packet loss, so let's start looking there first. Grab the network logs from a game that had those crazy spikes and let our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) scan them. Take a screenshot of what it says and post it here so I can take a look for you!","replies":[]}]}
