I cant download 15000 mbs because everyone is on almost all day including night time. I got it down to 6000 mbs left. I closed the client to play another game and when I return it starts up and says 6000 mbs left. but after a couple seconds it says installing and then goes back to 15000 mbs?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-07T22:09:17.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is kinda weird that it showed the old download progress at first, that must have been some weird visual error.
