Be tough, not mean. Stashu is not evil and has some pretty good ideas we'll hopefully see after this set of changes goes live.\n\nSo [I've](http://i.imgur.com/wJ8Hp0U.jpg) been part of the Cass discussion for a while, and it seems a [good number of you guys](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/ygxuK4gR-quick-cassiopeia-update-re-pbe-and-421?comment=000a) [agree with me on some stuff](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/oljxsEnc-i-dislike-cassiopeias-stacking-passive?comment=00030000), so that's cool. I just wanted to make a quick thread to remind everyone what this is all about. Tensions are high, an awesome champ [took a baseball bat to the face](http://i.imgur.com/o22LOqf.gif) and left on the curb for a few months, and nobody is happy about it. We're not happy, Stashu's not happy, and I'm sure the other Rioters working with him aren't happy. This whole thing has been a damn [train wreck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO5O59EuXRo) since the beginning, but we're starting to get back on track and have our voices heard!\n\nWhat's important to remember is that this isn't about [getting the entire rework reverted](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/ygxuK4gR-quick-cassiopeia-update-re-pbe-and-421?comment=000a00030000), or getting Stashu removed from the rework, or proving who was right all along about what identity fits Cass the best. We're all following these threads because we want Cassiopeia to be the best snake wizard lady she can be. We've all got the same goal in mind, and we could stand to be a bit more civil with each other.\n\nCalling out Stashu when [he says something outrageous and disappears for half a week](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/ygxuK4gR-quick-cassiopeia-update-re-pbe-and-421?comment=001d0001)? I'm all for that. If he's not communicating enough, let him know repeatedly, and we get a night like yesterday where he was on for hours responding to multiple posts in multiple threads. Telling Stashu [to resign](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/ygxuK4gR-quick-cassiopeia-update-re-pbe-and-421?comment=001d000100050000) or [calling to have him removed](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/T5czn627-stashu) [from the rework](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/eRmscAd4-riot-can-anyone-other-than-stashu-rework-cassiopeia) because [he and the rest of Riot is incompetent](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/ygxuK4gR-quick-cassiopeia-update-re-pbe-and-421?comment=000a0003000000000000) and spouting that [Cass is dead](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/ygxuK4gR-quick-cassiopeia-update-re-pbe-and-421?comment=0059) because of him? Not as cool. That's not improving snake wizardry, that's causing a fuss and getting us nowhere.\n\nEDIT: **To clarify, the following is not me saying the next Cass iteration is what we want, only that it's powerful, and we need to remember that this isn't about making Cass stronger, but about making Cass more fun (i.e. Less E focus, better passive, etc.)**\n\nAlso with the 4.21 changes coming out, I figure I'll give a quick forecast for those of you without PBE accounts. I think she'll be very, very strong in the right matchups. Like, [holy shiet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld2nWfIap2k) you have no idea. That poison amp on Twin Fang is so strong if you use it right and it's actually way more fun to manage than you'd think. A late game hyperscaling champ that can all-in you at level 3 with Q-E-E-Q-Ignite for a kill from near full HP? [That's not supposed to happen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULGaxScqbV4). Just remember that her being strong doesn't mean she's in a great place. There's still a ton of room for improvement.\n\nThe passive is still a [snake in her boot](http://i.imgur.com/h02JMZh.jpg), so to speak, but if Stashu's latest posts on the subject have been any indication, [it sounds like we'll be getting an actual gameplay passive to go along with the current one](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/8Vz3Nbpo-riotstashu-i-think-i-know-how-casss-passive-can-work-everyone-else-hear-me-out?comment=000200000000), or maybe even multiple gameplay passives that you unlock as you stack up. We may even see some \n[Petrifying Gaze tweaks](http://i.imgur.com/AU2VF.jpg) and [totally awesome Miasma buffs](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/8Vz3Nbpo-riotstashu-i-think-i-know-how-casss-passive-can-work-everyone-else-hear-me-out?comment=000200090000) in the package.\n\nAnyway, keep up the good discussions, Cass players. I've played this game for nearly 5 years and I've seen every major rework since Katarina, and I've never seen a champion's community so united in making sure she's every bit as badass as she deserves to be.\n\n[Scampy out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiUR9zf2mXk)\n\n(If you've clicked all the links so far I hope they entertained you.

The implementation obviously left plenty to be desired, but as far as the intention-- a late game high DPS hypercarry mage who takes high mechanical skill-- I really like it. They basically turned her into one of those champions who feels like she can 1v5 if played properly, and those champions are always the most fun to play in my opinion. The PBE changes right now also look nice, but I'm really hoping that cass can soon take a break from having major kit changes each patch so I don't feel like I'm wasting my time learning the changes.\n\nOpinions favoring the rework are obviously not popular, so I don't expect this post to be either. But I really do like the direction of the rework and hope to soon see Cassiopeia have a stable identity.

Thanks for giving the update a chance!\n\nThat's dispiriting.\n\n[The problems with her rework is rooted deep within the very rework. Your rework is flawed on a fundamental level](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/E1kLKJaz-stashu-have-you-ever-considered-making-cassiopeia-not-revolve-around-twin-fangs-e?comment=000d) and you will not be able to salvage this with tiny laser-guided changes just so you can preserve her current play-style. Because her current design at it's very core IS the problem.\n\n\n\nYou took a sledgehammer to demolish her old kit when it was flawed (nobody honestly believed she was perfect), but satisfying. I'm sure she can be torn down a few more times to get right, atleast until she is what she is supposed to be rather than this AP brawler.\n\n\nAnd again. [I really don't think you realize the problem with her rework.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/E1kLKJaz-stashu-have-you-ever-considered-making-cassiopeia-not-revolve-around-twin-fangs-e?comment=000d) It has nothing to do with how badly she sucks atm. If a champion is bad, just buff them, balancing is the easiest to resolve (relatively speaking). What many of us want is what made her fun to be preserved. Not...well...read the thread I linked to. Pay particularly close attention to point #1.\n-----\nLet me take other reworks to compare.\n\n{{champion:14}} and {{champion:268}}.\n\nBOTH champions are very much under-tuned upon release, hell, Azir was borderline unplayable due to his myriad of bugs (many which are still around might I add).\n\nHowever, they have a kit that FITS them. Even when I did badly as either of them (and with Sion, REALLY badly), it was still satisfying, it was still fun. With this Cassiopeia, it's unfun even when I do well.\n\nNotice how Sion is a tanky heavy-weight juggernaut in both identity and gameplay. How Azir is a horribly squishy soldier-reliant emperor who stands at the back (a bug preventing his soldiers from attacking when they're too close practically enforces that lmao), and his gameplay reflects that.\n\nNow notice how Cassiopeia's kit doesn't fit her at all as I explained before.\n\n\n> if the changes are dramatic they can really cause some of these sorts of problems.\n\nThe reason many people want her rework reverted isn't because they were 100% content with her old kit. It was flawed in multiple areas too! However, they want it reverted to get as far away from this rework as possible with Cassiopeia.\n\nHence, why she NEEDS to have many more overhauls. If the prospect of reverting the rework is just plain impossible, then the next best course of action is simply to do whatever it takes to make her as different as possible from the mess she is now.\n\nSo that she isn't a **hyper-carry** anymore.\nSo that she doesn't revolve around her E.\nSo that she will have powerful AoE again rather than being the **single-target mage** she currently is.\nSo her Passive...is better.","replies":[{"poster":"Narasimha","date":"2014-11-29T14:34:56.887+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:268}} \n\nWhy on earth do you have him under a rework?","replies":[{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2014-11-29T23:26:13.786+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The rework was referring to Sion.

I want to keep improving the champion where possible, but, if the changes are dramatic they can really cause some of these sorts of problems.\n\nSo uh, if I can, since I just re-read this....\n\nPeople seem to *want* dramatic changes in the vein of \"Noxious Blast is the best skill\" instead of \"Twin Fang is the only skill\" that the rework currently promotes.\n\n> I hope you stick with her through the changes, and I'll try to make any further changes laser-focused so as to fix problems without causing this sort of upheaval. Thanks for giving the update a chance!\n\nBut we **want** that upheaval. We want it to **go back to the way it was**.\n\nReworks shouldn't drastically change the way a champion plays unless it really is a full-blown redo of the champion (Soraka, Sion). Cassiopeia still has **four** of her five effects being the same, though numerically adjusted such that two of them seem to exist to force the player to both have skill and to enable one of those remaining ones.\n\nI mean, you **from an absolute objective standpoint** nerfed 60% of Cassiopeia's kit so you could buff 20% of it absurdly and let that last 20% serve to make her gated by time pressure.\n\nimo-- No numbers need to be analyzed there, since you just shifted her focus from \"AoE Poison\" to \"Single target DPS vs poisoned\".\n\nThe problem is that that 60% of her kit was the reason people played Cassiopeia. They really loved how it worked.\n\nLike how the people that play AP Kog'Maw just want to Bio-Arcane Barrage. Over. and over. and over... And they have fun with that. They're **not** playing optimally and **they know and are OK with that**. They're **having fun** in a **game**.\n\nThe rework prevents **the people that liked Q/W Cassiopeia play** which required managing Deadly Cadence (re: using 60% of kit) **can no longer have fun doing this** because they **feel absolutely worthless**.\n\nWe can **numerically** but not **conceptually** show that.\n\nWe want **conceptually* a mage that focuses on **poisoning things**-- not a mage that **focuses poisoned things**. Do you see and understand the difference?\n\nTwin Fang, Cassiopeia's E, 20% of her kit, was JUST THAT.\n\n20% of her kit. The _optimal_ 20%.\n\nBut lots of people didn't play her optimally and knew they weren't playing her optimally. And she was reworked anyway... into something that they couldn't have fun with.\n\nAnd now they are mad because they can't have fun.\n\nSo... to you, Stashu:\n\n#It is only a game. Why do you have to leave your players mad? Give them what they want (since they already had it) or explain *extremely thoroughly* why they can't have it. These people want a thing, but you don't give a straight answer. They would be best able to understand your perspective, **IF AND ONLY IF** you give to them \\_what it is that you think\\_ in both high-level thought (say, the design goals) and in layman's terms (\"since we want Cass to do X... we gave her Y... we want her to do X because Z...\").\n\nThat, in my opinion, is the way to make sure your players know what YOU want.\n\nThat is the way to make sure the PLAYERS know what WILL NOT happen.

Lane bully, weird passive/E/ult considering her character, yadda yadda. Fine, she could have benefited from a rework. However, this rework **doesn't actually fix anything** except for making her strictly weaker in lane. I don't understand why it's acceptable that this skirmish-oriented and spam-happy bully is what we're currently calling Cass. Even if she is strong, don't you think there's a problem?\n\nWhy is all of her power still on her E? Why is she embracing the curse by being an overt-but-weak bully until she just gets to kill things? **Why is this kit okay?** Because I seem to be one of like maybe 5 people total saying that it's not.","replies":[{"poster":"Scampy","date":"2014-11-29T15:24:10.836+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I hope you read on to the part where I agree with you.\n\n>Just remember that her being strong doesn't mean she's in a great place.

We may even see some Petrifying Gaze tweaks and totally awesome Miasma buffs in the package.\n\nSo far, all we've read has been about relatively small changes.

Here are my opinions.\n\nI have several issues with Casseopia. I may not be as helpful as some of these other players in this thread, but I used to play her a lot before I moved on to other champions. My issues with Casseopia are the following:\n\n1)\tShe has a passive that is only useful the more enemies she has poisoned. When she finally gets to the passive stacks they are underwhelming. From what I can tell the passive only stacks on enemy champions. Getting 400+ stacks on enemy champions hardly ever happens.\n2)\tAll of Casseopia’s abilities are easily dodgable. Her Q ability can be run past. Her W ability can be dodged just by moving around it. How is a player supposed to poison enemies with abilities that are easily dodgable? That is the problem.  I think she is a lot like Karthus, who I think also has problems with his abilities in terms of hitting enemy champions. At least Karthus has decent range on his abilities and they can be used to place it strategically. Unfortunately he suffers the same fate as Casseopia does with the Q ability.\n3)\tHer Q ability was changed recently. There is a longer cooldown on it and the cast range was changed. Her Q ability is basically useless now.\n4)\tI do not feel like her current abilities and special ability truly capture the essence of the character. I was so excited to read about Casseopia because she reminded me of a Disney villain. When I got to playing her she did not feel right for the character. I thought Casseopia was going to be a champion that was sneaky and only went in for the kill when the opportunity called for it. When I first saw Casseopia I envisioned her being able to summon snakes to fight for her.\n5)\tCasseopia has no sustainability. Her ultimate can be used to escape from fights but that has a long cooldown and can only be used in a few situations.\nChanges I think need to be done and own ideas:\n1)\tGet rid of the special ability. The community has even told you, they do not like the special ability. If there was a way to have her abilities hit the enemy champion then I could see the passive idea working. Unfortunately the problem is her abilities are all dodgable, and worse than Karthus. If you are so intent on keeping this passive stacking special ability, you need to fix her abilities then.\n2)\tI do not know why but I kind of feel like her ultimate would be a good ability. The part that applies a stone effect on enemies should be removed, but it would be nice to have an ability that gives her an opportunity to move back or escape from a fight. It needs to be tweaked and edited but that is just my idea about it. She should get an ultimate that does something else for her and not force players to wait for it on cooldown. Casseopia is slow and it sucks to have to wait for her ultimate if it is on a long cooldown. There are so many possibilities you can do with this character, and this is what we get? There is no imagination.\n3)\tThe most useless ability for me is her Q. I detest abilities that go over the mouse cursor. They are slow and have a really limited cast range on them. Players can simply just run away from it, even if you try to place it strategically in front of their path. The ability is useless in range and usability. I kind of want to see her E in place of her Q. The new Q should apply poison to enemies but also do more damage on enemies that are already poisoned. The damage on it should be adjusted but that would be something more useful than what she has now. She needs to have at least one ability that can poison an enemy. The Q should be changed regardless.\n4)\tTo be completely honest I do not feel there is anything wrong with her W ability, but the fact that he Q ability is also dodgable is why I am mentioning it. Either her Q or W needs to go and be replaced with something that can at least poison one enemy. Even if you try to strategically place it, enemies can still dodge it.","replies":[]}]}
