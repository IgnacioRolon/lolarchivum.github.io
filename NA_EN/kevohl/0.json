Luckily I didn't jump right into a Ranked game and instead fired up an aram game. League has resolution settings for 4K monitors and it looks great, there was so much more detail then when I was playing on my old hp laptop. But there were some UI scaling issues that are honestly ruining playing league.\r\n\r\nFirst, the mouse courser is devastatingly small, when I'm in a team fight or trying to click on a specific minion in a wave it is incredibly easy to lose sight of the courser and not click on the right enemy. How is there not corrected scaling options for this?????\r\n\r\nNext, the chat is too tiny to read without squinting, the shop descriptions and icons are equally tiny, and the health bars over everything are also scaled way down to where I can barely tell who has how much health.\r\n\r\nBut the worst part is that the map becomes completely useless. The map itself is still the same size as it was when i played on my old 1080p laptop, however, on a 2160p (4K) screen the icons representing Champions, towers, drag, and minions, etc. become absolutely tiny that you have to stare at the map to figure out which champ is which.\r\n\r\n4K has been becoming more common in monitors and laptops and I've found archived posts from over two years ago stating that they had these same problems. I feel that gamers like to have newer and better equipment, yet Riot seems to be neglecting us. I mean not a single employee has tried it out on a 4K screen and noticed the issues? I cant imagine it would be hard for them to adjust UI scaling for High Res screens. Can anyone tell me why this hasnt been fixed in over two years time??\r\n\r\nAlso if anyone has any tips for at least fixing some of the scaling problems I would appreciate them.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-21T16:37:20.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I can imagine a lot of the UI was designed well before 4K became affordable and applicable for gaming. While there's currently no full support for 4K, we're certainly looking into it.\n\nIn the meantime, a lot of players can play on 4K with no issues when running Full Screen and changing the scale of the UI using the in-game settings under **Interface**. I should also mention that if you alt+tab at all during a match when in Full Screen mode, it will completely mess up your UI scaling and will require you to launch back into the match. There's no workaround for this as far as I know.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Zeredder","date":"2017-08-12T07:54:55.428+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any update on this?

I can live with the small chat and shop items, but the small mouse courser and map icons are definite issues.

Under the *Compatibility* tab, check the box at the bottom for \"Disable DPI Scaling\".
