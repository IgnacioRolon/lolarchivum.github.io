Riot isn't treating it like a seperate game outside of the reward system.\n\nTo be blunt, if the client is going to eat more resources in order to support TFT the reward system should be linked.  There's no reason we can't level up, earn essence, and spend that on the Emporium for Little Legends or Map Skins.  They don't even have to offer all of them since they want money, they could offer older ones.\n\nThe thing is the game is built with a consistent reward system in place in every mode but TFT.  TFT you eventually stop getting rewards and I don't understand it.  And Riot treats this like a new mode rather than a new game, TFT ends up in \"Quick Gameplay Thoughts\" often because its attached to the client and its factored into their decision making.  It shares the same assets and is tied to the same client.\n\nIf TFT had its own client entirely there'd be an argument for it being an entirely new game.  As is, whether you play it or not it is affecting your game experience because the client is altered to eat more resources.  Its tied to the RP system with Little Legends and certain Map Skins as is.  Why couldn't it also be tied to the BE system?  Even if it was its own game with no link to these systems and no link to the client, I think it'd be desirable to have a reward for each game played.\n\nSeriously, almost every free to play game has perpetual progression to reward you.  Underlords gives XP for each game, every MOBA gives XP for each game, even paid games like Overwatch with this type of system offers you XP for each game.  And these turn into new champions, new skins, ect.  Even if the reward is incredibly minor or is a point system that you can save to spend at specific events, even a tiny reward is more than nothing.  As is, TFT has a hard cap on how often you can be rewarded for playing it.  Its a model similar to Hearthstone which even Riot seems to think is bad since they're building LoR with perpetual rewards to upstage it.\n\nEdit: Also I find it funny you didn't address RGMs.  We were getting XP from Odyssey and the Thresh game mode which are built like totally new games with a League control scheme being the only correlation.  There's precedent here.","replies":[{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-11-22T18:44:50.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Edit: Also I find it funny you didn't address RGMs.  We were getting XP from Odyssey and the Thresh game mode which are built like totally new games with a League control scheme being the only correlation.

TFT has the same names of champs, and the single skill they have is based on one they have on SR, but the map, opponents, style, planning, items, mana, and every other function of the mechanics or entirely different.  Again, I'm astounded you're not recognizing the vast difference between TFT and all of the other game types/modes.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
