It's 350, that's right boys 350 units. You nerfed Yasuo because he had too much mobility. Why can't we tone it down to like 340 or 345? It seems stupid he gets the second highest base MS with two gap closers.\r\n\r\nAlso what is with his ulti? It has stupid base damages and considering it has insane amount of utility why does it do stupid damage?\r\n\r\nHow about his sustain in the jungle?

The best way to nerf his mobility would be to reduce his movement speed but other than that his q range is strong but not game breaking. An extension on its cd would probably be the best nerf for it. The w literally can not be nerfed right now. As I said his sustain is pretty weak right now and extending w cool down would worsen it and on top of that the range isnt abnormally large on it.
