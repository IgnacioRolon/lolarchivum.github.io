That sounds like a long time, but considering that the stacks last for ten seconds, it is moderately easy to stay on four stacks by constantly standing in a minion wave or harassing your opponent. This also isn't factoring in cooldown reduction, either. At 40% CDR, it is on a 2.7 second cooldown, which means you can hit max stacks at 10.8 seconds of spamming the ability. Each stack increases all forms of Vladimir's spell vamp, self-healing and health regeneration, which also stacks with itself multiplicatively. Spell vamp is only 33% effective in AoE, which Tides of Blood is counted as. However, it is 100% effective on single-target spells, such as Vlad's Q. Each stack of Tides of Blood increases all these effects by 4% per stack at level 1 to 8% per stack at level 5. However, as I said, these stacks are multiplicative, which means you don't get 8%/16%/24%/32% from your stacks at level 5, you get 8%/16.64%/25.9712%/36.048896% increased healing effects from your stacks at level 5. If you combine this with the item Spirit Visage and the mastery Second Wind, if you are below 25% health, you will get 42.56%/53.9648%/66.281984%/79.58454272% increased healing effects. Your spell vamp, health regen, and self-healing for all of your abilities is increased by 80% with just Spirit Visage and a mastery and four level 5 E stacks.\n\nSo, what does that mean? Well, if you drink a health potion, you would probably get about 270 health instead of the usual 150 health. Vladimir's base health regen is 17.2 at level 18. With all of what I just mentioned, it will be 30.96. Your spell vamp would also be pretty extreme. If you JUST had a hextech revolver for spell vamp, it would go from 12% normally to 21.6%. Spell vamp applies during the damage of an ability. Let's just see what Vlad's Q does with only 2 items, a mastery, and 4 stacks on a level 5 E while below 25% health:\n\nQ on-hit damage: 90/125/160/195/230 (+60% AP)\nSpell Vamp applies 100% to single target abilities\n21.6% of 230 is 49.68, or about 50 health. This is just from base damage alone.\nLet's assume you have a low 120 AP. 60% of 120 is 72\n72 + 230 is 307\n21.6% of 307 is 66.312 health healed.\nThis may not sound like much, but we are using max rank Q and not counting damage/heal from E, with only 1 spell vamp item (3 items technically, assuming you're not using Deathcap as your 120 AP item and that we ignore extra damage from Luden's)\nAnd this ability at max rank is on a 4 second cooldown without CDR.\nSingle target and undodgeable. With only ONE spell vamp item, ONE AP item, and a Spirit Visage\nAnd I'm not even factoring in the bonus health given from the ability itself, which is not affected by spell vamp but still scales off AP.\n\nThat's all I feel like typing for now. You can probably just extrapolate and imagine what a full-build Vladimir would be like with all of this.","replies":[{"poster":"AyRe CoNteMpT","date":"2015-06-27T19:43:32.388+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":8,"body":"yeah you know, there is this champion called poppy who is probably the strongest carry in the game at full build because she is immune to EVERYTHING and instagibs even tanks. why does nobody play her? because you wont get to the point where you can do this consistently because of her really horrendous laning and impact early game, plus her jungle clear super sucks. very hard to play that champ.\n\nvladimir is the same. he is literally 100% the same as poppy except they use him in pro games. if they would use poppy, you would see poppys in soloQ all day and they would suck and feed just like vladimir players do. she is literally not worse early and not worse late. her only downside is that she cant really push waves, which vladimir can and which is really the only thing that makes him viable.\n\nyou could say ryze is similar to vladimir in that he kinda needs to get a few items but he gets them a bit faster due to them being cheaper/better andhe also has a stronger laning phase, but still not the best. i would say, ryze is on the verge of viability, but still a rather bad pick.\n\nthe reason it works in LCS and not in soloQ is because of the teamplays. you see basically not a single game where people \"just lane\" and then after 20 minutes group sometimes for something. they always do some early rotations to at least try and create scenarios where their champions can be utilized and then protect them so they can actually get the gold they need. tho they dont do that because its like \"the best\" strategy but only because its \"meta\" right now. \n\nas in every game, the meta shifts constantly and even without patches in many other esports-games you see the meta changing even after years without a patch and people finding new ways to beat things and suddenly some things become completely unviable not because they have been changed, but just because people figured out the weaknesses. and saying \"they are pros, they know their shit\" is so ignorant. pros dont know ANYTHING about the game that a regular person cant know. like, bonzo98 from bronze 3 can literally know as much about the game as doublelift in theory.\n\ni remember the days when \"pros\" played high-killpressure champs and actually fought in lane, not like now where they play the gayest most passive bullshit possible. and im 100% sure that the day will come when pros will actually start playing fighters again and actually FIGHT for dominance and create pressure. and then nobody will play vladimir or ryze because they dont have pressure, they are literal cheese champions.\n\nand just to get back to the point of vladimir: he cannot lane against MOST champions. like, he goes to lane, he gets traded and dived and killed over and over again or just simply lanefrozen and zoned because hes SO WEAK and so shit and the only option he can be allowed to get to 2+ items is a team that builds around his lategame and works towards getting him gold for 20 minutes. that doesnt happen in soloQ and thats why the champion is just not viable.\n\nthe same would happen if a pro team would pick like darius vs vladimir in toplane and then work towards denying him. if the team puts effort into isolating toplane and denying the vladimir his teams help, darius can shut him down to a point where vlad has 30 cs when his team surrenders at 20. \n\nyou cant look at LCS and then say \"but people play X there so it must be good\". they play X because everything has certain strengths so they work out X strengths and play towards them as a team. it doesnt mean X by himself is viable, it means he has a certain power that this team wants so they put effort into drawing that power out because they believe for some reason that it helps them win the game.","replies":[{"poster":"BetaDude40","date":"2015-06-28T02:20:30.251+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never said a single word about his viability in the LCS. I didn't even mention the term \"LCS\" until just now. Why are you throwing words into my mouth I have never said? I don't care about what pro players think of him or what they would do as/against him.\n\nVladimir's entire tactic is to just out-sustain you to death. Purely and simply, that is his goal. There are several factors, combined with the champion itself which can make this unhealthy\n\n**1. Vladimir has no mana.** This is one of the biggest issues I have with him (or mostly any manaless champ, really) in that he is unconstrained by anything except cooldowns to continue attacking you. And, let's face it, those health costs aren't going to affect you after you get your core item. On other champions, like Gnar, this is mostly an annoyance. But on Vladimir, when you can actually get substantial amounts of health from nothing but spam, then it's a huge problem.\n\n**2. Vladimir can be untargettable.** This is less of an issue I have in the laning phase and more of an issue I have in any general circumstance. Being untargettable is a very powerful form of utility, and while his offers no gap closers, it is the longest untargettable ability in the game. I understand that the health cost for this ability is actually pretty substantial,  but between 20% of your current health or getting hit by tons of damage, I'd easily take the former. I'll give that Vladimir seems to pay more for having this ability in his kit than others (e.g. Fizz, Ekko). But yeah, it also heals him. Because, you know, he doesn't already have enough sustain.\n\n**3. Vladimir is entirely point-and-click.** This is something that is obviously controversial territory. On one hand, point-and-click abilities tend to be purposefully made to be substantially weaker than they're skillshot counterparts in exchange for their much higher rate of hits. On the other hand, this can lead to much more effective harassing, damaging, and is much more difficult for enemies to react to in-game. It's not necessarily bad, he pays for it by having low range, but it's a health problem nonetheless. I'm also not saying to make everything he has skillshots, either, because I hate it when that's the only solution the balance team can come up with. It's not a hugely bad problem, but a problem nonetheless.\n\n**4. Vladimir is rewarded with tankiness for building damage, or vice versa.** The absolute number-one complaint from every player who complains about Riven, no matter what elo, is that she is rewarded with a very effective shield for building nothing but damage. To be fair, Singed also has an ability like this, except like Vladimir's, it's a passive and remains with him throughout the game. I personally think the general idea of getting the best of both tankiness _and_ damage is something you have to tread very lightly in. In the case of Vladimir, it's only health, but with the interesting quirk in that it also works the other way around, where he gains AP for however much health he builds. Given, the exchange rates aren't the highest (AP = 2.5% bonus health; Health = 140% AP) and they seem to favor more towards building AP than health. However, this is quite an interesting issue, in that Vladimir, if he gets behind, can indeed build tank and still do damage assuming he gets enough health. I'm also not counting health and AP modifiers making issues with his passive (Items like Rabadon's, or Masteries like Juggernaut) and increasing the exchange rates by more than they should.\n\nI understand Vladimir's strengths and weaknesses, and I honestly believe that the strengths he is given are just way too good for someone built entirely around sustain. At the moment, I don't have any solutions that could put him in a good spot, but I might eventually have an idea to get him into a place where he's not so binary and tough to deal with.","replies":[{"poster":"AyRe CoNteMpT","date":"2015-06-28T08:12:17.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i UNDERSTAND all of your problems with him but i simply dont agree.\n\n1. many champions have no mana and i cant see where vladimir is more unleathy and toxic than many other champions, even some mana ones. champions like riven, katarina, zed, gnar, rexai, lee sin are absolutely insane and have way more raw power than vladimir in their kits. even tho katarina can be said to be kinda weak in lane, her very long range and even higher safety makes up for it tho and i really dont see this many katarina whine threads.\n\nand honestly, all those champions ARE weaker than strong fighters due to them all having some sort of mobility other than movespeed and no mana. they are just weaker and their only power is extended poking and trading that out-sustains not only enemies health but also their mana, but thats when you play another weak champion they are ALLOWED to do that. you COULD play a STRONG FIGHTER and deny them everything BECAUSE of their weakness. in league of legends, people really refuse to beat weak champions with strong champions and instead complain about their scaling. its NOT a design flaw, its a mentality flaw.\n\n2. yes, untargetability is pretty annoying but vladimirs is one of the LEAST annoying ones because of its long cooldown, low damage and the synergy with the rest of his kit. i would complain about fizz any day before vladimir. you know whats even worse than untargetability? knockups. and many more champions have knockups than untargetability, and THATS really unhealthy.\n\n3. well, vladimirs ultimate is somewhat of a skillshot but other than that, there are like MANY MANY champions that are almost entirely point&click and it doesnt hurt them either. like, who cares. skillshots have other advantages to make up for their lack of consistency. they usually have longer ranges, you can hit invisible/hidden champions, you can check brushes, you can sometimes hit multiple people. thats why there cant be a long range targeted ability, but with vladimirs range he basically gives you a kill if he ever Qs you if you dont play a shitty champion.\n\n4. vladimir is the prime example of a scaling champion, maybe along with nasus. both of them scale so tremendously on being left alone to farm and they get really oppressive with some items later on, but why is nasus not being played much anymore? because people actually push him out of lane now and even kill and dive him because hes just THAT WEAK and the only way he can live through laningphase is by maxing his spiritfire and farming with it because he literally cannot touch minions against most champs but then again, that prevents him from stacking his Q and therefore scaling strong.\n\nthe same goes for vladimir, but the problem here is that people try to \"counter\" him with other weak laners and \"outscale\" but \"outscaling\" is a myth that doesnt exist. either you are able to fight and dominate, or you leave the entire game up to luck. you literally say \"i will not participate in this game for 20 minutes and if its still even enough for me to be relevant, lets go and try to win\".\n\nmost games are decided way before 20 minutes tho, not only on pro level but ESPECIALLY in soloQ, which goes heavily against the viability of vladimir and similar champions. seriously, let him scale if he wants to and just play the game its supposed to be played.","replies":[{"poster":"BetaDude40","date":"2015-06-28T13:03:51.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you're misunderstanding the entire topic of the post, really. Toxic =/= strong, it just means poorly designed, and for Vladimir's goal of out-sustaining his enemy and what he is given to perform that task, it is quite toxic. Toxic kits tend to be complained about more often on stronger champions, simply because they are strong and toxic at the same time.\n\nTake, for example, pre-rework Sion. He wasn't a strong champion, but he was often regarded as being one of the most toxic champions in the League. All a Sion then would do is leave E on the entire game, charge and detonate shield for some waveclear to assist in getting your bonus health, and Q if someone feels threatening. He had absolutely no power in teamfights unless he purposefully charged his shield beforehand and then tried to stand in the middle of the enemy team. After that, he would stun the carry and then become a meatshield. Alternatively, he would be one of the most annoying split pushers in the game, with a lock-on instant stun every 4-ish seconds. You pretty much had to have 2 or 3 people to deal with Sion alone, but he was almost entirely useless in teamfights and had no presence there. It was unfun to fight him, it was unfun to play as him, it was just generally boring and extremely binary.\n\nThis is a similar issue with Vladimir, although he is also a pretty strong champion. You claim that his power spike will take a while to achieve, but really, even if you skip the long-drawn-out methods I said a couple posts earlier, a hextech revolver will surely get him at least manageable. What you say is to counterpick him by intentionally bullying him out of lane with some type of early game bully. This is just way easier said than done, due to his harass and sustain being pretty good even at these early levels, despite their significantly longer cooldowns. Plus, counterpicking does not exist in blind pick or teambuilder, so that option of fighting him is practically exhausted. Both Nasus and Vladimir share some amount of sustain, otherwise they would simply be bullied out of lane, but this isn't always the case.\n\nIf you were to take a non-ranged fighter into a Nasus, with the intent of harassing the ever-loving hell out of him, his farming may be hindered, but it's not going to stop him from farming under tower. Plus, Nasus has one of the greatest peels in a single ability that has ever been created, which is especially useful on those low-mobility champs. It's not impossible to bully out a Vladimir, but he's going to get a revolver and then it will be so much harder for you to affect him. It's not fun to play a game where you have to babysit this one guy and make sure he doesn't get as much farm, so that at least when he gets his revolver, you'd have a chance to get a {{item:3211}} or something.\n\nMy other post explaining the power behind his abilities was merely just a post showing how strong he was. If you could heal more than half a health potion in the damaging portion of a single, 4 second cooldown no-cost ability with only 3 items, not counting any other runes, masteries, or health from practically every other source, then I'd probably say something was wrong.\n\nKeep saying to just bully him out of lane and that he is extremely weak. This is how all carry-oriented champions start out. They just have to play a game of survival for the first 10 minutes and then once they get some items they simply outscale their opponent. There is a reason that Nasus and Vladimir are NOT underplayed (at least just from personal experience in lower elo, although they are far from as uncommon as you make them sound) is because of their carry-oriented kits. A game is very unlikely to end before 20 minutes, but games can go on upwards to an hour, with some extreme cases lasting significantly longer. Hypercarry/hyperscaling champs remain useful throughout this entire time. Yeah, you could pick Darius and go against Vlad, but unless he absolutely stomps Vlad, Darius is going to fall off due to his poor late-game scaling, and Vlad will just slowly increase in power. This is normal for people like Nasus, where the only response is just to stay in lane and hammer the hell out of them until they go farm a different lane, or they buy a core item that increases their damage or survivability even more.\n\nVladimir is not as strong as other people, but he is so much more of a pain to go against that I'd just rather not. With the AP item changes and poor MR itemization, Vlad will remain to be pretty strong, even if put a good ways behind, simply because all it takes is a few items to get back in completely. He scales, but he scales too hard, and when his goal is to out-sustain, it will cause significant issues.","replies":[{"poster":"AyRe CoNteMpT","date":"2015-06-28T13:26:46.164+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i do understand the point and im not saying vladimir is like the best champ design in the game, but he is so weak and so useless, its literally a waste of time to talk about nerfing him.\n\nalso, you are using the word \"bully\" over and over again. there is no \"bully\" in this game, there is only \"i go and let him poke me for free because im a fool\" or a \"if he wants CS, he will die\"\n\nyou talk about revolver because it gives him sustain so if i deal 10% of his health in damage he will heal it back so its \"hard to bully\" but if you play a strong champ, he will take 80% and the next time he will try it, he will die.\n\nvladimir basically has the same weakness as trandamere. to sustain, he needs to fight, but if you zone him from even being able to fight, he cant lane.\n\ngood thing most fighters in this game are able to do this easily. also, vladimir is easy to gank despite common belief.\nall he can do is walk 2 seconds untargetable and then thats it. most junglers and laners have enough cc and/or damage to kill him in 2-3 seconds, ESPECIALLY if he has to overextend to get farm because the fighter froze the lane.\n\nmidlane vladimir is a bit harder because the lane is so short, but there are some midlaners who outscale him bigtime (cassio, azir, even ryze) so if he picks vlad and wants to \"scale\", you can go azir and still dominate the lane while outscaling him at the same time.\n\nbtw, most fighters who can beat vladimir early can beat him all game long and thus \"outscale\" him aswell. \n\nPS: you talk about spectres cowl and such. i will repeat what im saying in every thread about champion complaints: if you try to beat a champion in his field of power, you will lose. vladimirs power is doing really bad trades and then sustaining up nevertheless. this means, if you buy defense against a vladimir without having killpower allready, you lose the game and you deserve it.\n\nPPS: tho if vladimir got a really nice rework, i wouldnt mind.\ntho i think he is one of the champs in game who are most true to their class (vampire) and as such, i kinda like the idea. even tho i dislike him very much ingame.\n","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Halo","date":"2015-06-28T02:50:50.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh come on. Thats not the only problem poppy's got. You didnt even mention that she doesnt have a single ranged ability or harass and that any champ with any mobility can kite her without a problem. Shes got more bad matchups than elise for gods sake. \n\nYou cant fucking compare vlad and poppy. They are way too diffrent. Vlad is a lae bully that is really good at sustainging the lane no matter what while also harassing the enemy down. Hes go real good teamfight an is generally a pain in the ass to play against. Hes also got one of the easiest laningphases in the GAME.\n\nPoppy on the other hand might be a strong carry but. She is easily kiten because the only cc shes got is one that requires a wall and also pushes the enemy away. She is not invoulreble when she ults. She jus cant take dmg or get affected by anyone but the person she ults. This means that unless the enemy have someone without any cc or dmg it damm hard to find a good target to ult. The only ingage she got is running in and clicking e and that is all the stickyness shes got. She is extremly voulreble to long range harass too.\n\nYou wanna know why none plays poppy in lcs nor in soloq for that matter?\n1. Shit laning phase \n2. Farm reliant\n3. Doesnt contribute to teamfight almost what so ever. \n4. She isnt a tank (usualy) \n5. No sticky potential (counterd by mobility)\n6. What she does others do better and safer. \n7. Shes one of the most if not the most mana hungry champ IN THE GAME. \nlvl 1 she can use 4 q:s and level 8 she can use around 7. She is extremly mana hungry.\n8. Shes got no sustain or shield what so ever. The only way to avoid dmg is wit her passive. \n\n> i would say, ryze is on the verge of viability, but still a rather bad pick.\n\nYeah right.\n\nps: U dont have a single game with poppy or vladimir.
