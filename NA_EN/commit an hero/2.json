Tombdragon nailed what I was trying to say, that Lee is that whole saying \"You can be whatever you want to be.\"  Your team needs a tank?  Lee can do that.  You need an assassin?  Lee's got that.  You need a peeler?  Lee's your man.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-12-20T02:37:04.071+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just a few base stats at level 18.\n\nChamp A: armour 87, MR 53, HP 2016, shield maxed 200 HP + ap\nChamp B: armour 90, MR 53, HP 2038, 85 +17% max HP\nChamp C: armour 93, MR 53, HP 2016, 220 HP + ap\nChamp D: armour 86, MR 53, HP 2096, none\n\nSo not counting utility (mobility, stuns, ect..) or damage, only 1 of those looks really tanky. Although 3 of them are \"tanks\" by Riot's labels. Being \"tanky\" is very dependent on items over kit. I'm not saying Lee Sin IS a tank. I'm saying he can be a tank. (He is one of those 4 champs)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
