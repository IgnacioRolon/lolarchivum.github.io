And that's not even at peak times. There's probably a massive number of those that are reports of trolls and toxic players. Regardless of the %, even a small amount is still going to be a large amount throughout the course of an entire day. They cannot just stop and respond in-depth to every player who reaches out to them, they've even said they tried that before and it was impossible to maintain.\n\ntldr; Give them time, things aren't magically fixed overnight.
