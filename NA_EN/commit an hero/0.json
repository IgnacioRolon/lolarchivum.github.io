You did make a great point that it isn't mean for only tank champions. 45HP is pretty big early but falls off later in the game. \n\nCan we talk about Strength of the Ages. I don't see it being picked up very often or in rare cases. Such as Tahm Kench as he scales very well off of health. If this is meant to be the tank Mastery then why does it feel so awkward compared to every other Keystone. \n\nTake for example Bond of Stone gives a 2% Damage reduction but increases to 8% when near an ally. (Being changed to 3%/6% next patch from the looks of it) or Grasp of the Undying which makes you steal 3% of your HP from an enemy champion. These Keystone will always have a benefit at some point in the game. They'll always give you something. \n\nHowever. if you or an Ally missed the cannon then you are essentially delaying yourself. This Keystone feels like you are on the clock. If you don't have a great game or just certain things don't align then you are behind. It should take roughly 23 minutes if you get every cannon. Which is fairly balanced for the amount of HP you are being awarded. Not sure how long it would take as a Jungler as I haven't done the math on it. \n\ntl'dr Strength of Ages mechanics feels gimmicky at best. It's a stacking mechanic that'll give you a mediocre benefit if behind.","replies":[{"poster":"LeeDark","date":"2015-11-28T00:24:09.270+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a jungler, it is four full clears of the jungle, if you include the crab.  More likely, you'll get 6 or 8 in your first clear, then 4 or 5 in the next clear, and back to 6 or 8 afterward.  This would make it 6 full clears, each delayed by ganking, which is the real problem.\n\nStrength of Ages encourages tanks to power-farm the jungle like they would with Devourer.  But tanky junglers, like Sej, Rek'sai, etc., tend to excel at early ganking.  The Keystone and playstyle are diametrically opposed to one another, while Bond of Stone synergizes with a tanky jungler's playstyle.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2015-11-28T15:21:55.037+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my experience the best keystone for most Sej/Amumu style tanks is the one you didn't mention.\n\nGrasp of the Undying is super strong on more offensive tanks since it procs off of your HP. When you have a lot of HP the mastery damage and heal get to be significant and since you don't die quickly it's not unreasonable to expect to proc it multiple times, especially since it gives you sustain to help with this.\n\n>Strength of Ages encourages tanks to power-farm the jungle like they would with Devourer. But tanky junglers, like Sej, Rek'sai, etc., tend to excel at early ganking.\n\nSej doesn't and Rek'sai isn't a tank. \n\nRek'sai's a fighter jungler at her core. She excels at early game pressure. This means the only tier 3 defence mastery you should ever consider on her is GotU. You honestly should probably stick to Fervor of Battle on her though, it's pretty much just the best keystone for anyone who can make good use of it.\n\nSej on the other hand has sub-par ganks pre 6. They're not Shyvana tier or anything but she certainly doesn't \"excel at early ganking\". She gets outperformed in early ganks by any traditional early pressure jungler, (hence the name) she picks up post 6 but she's still far worse at ganking than people like Lee and Elise.\n\nSej actually does play a farm game early. The only time you can really gank as Sej is when someone offers you the kill on a silver platter. You also do need to farm as Sej since she scales hard into the late game, her powercurve is very similar to a devourer jungler. \n\nI'd say overall Strength of Ages synergieses fairly well with Sej's playstyle, definitely better than Bond of Stone. The reason why Bond of stone is better is because 300 HP just isn't that good compared to other keystone masteries.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CrazedPorcupine","date":"2015-11-28T06:44:02.121+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Could we look at Zilean in terms of which masteries are good on him?\n\nThunderlord's isn't that great because of the large window between Zilean's Damage points,\n\nStormraider isn't good because Zilean's burst is so delayed,\n\nDeathfire Touch isn't good because Zil's damage is AoE, and so get's penalized\n\nWindspeaker's blessing isn't good because His ult is the only healing he has on his kit.\n\nOverall, none of the Keystone choices are good on Zilean, and it's sub optimal to go 15/15/0 on him.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ExecutorDill","date":"2015-11-28T03:17:39.612+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So why hit veteran scars when unyielding is at the top of the tree?

While some of this rise in power for individual champs is to be expected (Rammus wrecks ADC's and Trundle is strong whenever super tanks are strong), when a class as whole is standing out above their peers it's probably a good idea to look at the underlying power from systems that support that class.  In this case we feel the Resolve tree is offering too much multiplicative scaling to tanks in too many different places.  \n\n**We feel that Veteran's scars is a great candidate for conversion to flat as it reduces the crazy item scaling tanks are getting right now, opens up the tree to more characters, and creates an easier to grok choice vs. the %healing and shield mastery.**\n\n---Final note, some of you may be asking: \"Why not just nerf Mundo? He's the real problem!\" If it was just Mundo that's exactly what we'd do, but right now we're seeing immense strength across the whole class of characters so feel it's better to nerf a few masteries than hit 6 champs.  If this leaves some of the already  weaker tanks in a bind we're likely to buff them up. We had a similar thought process when we hotfixed Warlord's Bloodlust.  You can hit Yasuo, Trynd, and other early crit users, or you can look at the thing that they all have in common: crazy synergy with Warlord's.","replies":[{"poster":"Ipols","date":"2015-11-28T23:13:47.947+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey I understand the reasoning you explained and I'm not totally against it, I also don't play tanks so I hope I'm not biased.

Not only this patch, but every patch since the juggernaut items, tank scaling options have been limited further and further. From cinderhulk to thornmail to randuins to these masteries, to garen swapping to flat resistances W to the slew of excellent midgame juggernaut items with relatively much poorer lategame tank scaling, it feels like tanks just aren't welcome in the lategame, which is a blow to how I enjoy league of legends.\n\nAt the same time AD champions have been presented a handful of dedicated tankslaughtering items in the preseason, and more and more champs in this game do % max health or % true damage which leaves items feeling less and less satisfying in the first place.\n\nI don't understand why a low-damage high mobility and tenacity champion like old Garen can't exist in League's lategame.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Clown Apocalypse","date":"2015-11-29T16:47:43.011+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Except the only reason people are breaking out all of these tanks is because you guys buffed the hell out of adc's.  Of course Rammus is getting picked a lot and strong right now.  He counters  broken autoattack champs.  Aka adc's.  Aka yasuo.  aka yi.  aka tryndamere.  45 health is worthless and makes that mastery not even worth putting a single point in for a tank.  You make two new items to shred tanks and that's not enough?  You have to shred the tanks even further before the game even begins and items are built?  People should be strong when they specifically itemize against what you are building.  You have champs and items specifically designed to deal with people who stack hp.  Instead of nerfing tanks until they barely feel like a tank.....how bout you start making videos about counterplay to the things people claim are so op. Show them what kind of champs and builds are good against the things they complain about. You guys really make it hard for a person to keep up with all the nuances of the game with this constant buff and  nerf cycle.  A person may learn how to counter certain champs, then you come along and nerf the hell out of the most common way of countering that class of characters.  \n\nYou have like 120 champs.  You guys really need to start letting some things remain consistent for a while.  I didn't play for a month once and had to learn the game all over when I came back because in just that time you guys made new items, changed the jungle, buffed people, nerfed people, rebuffed people etc.  Then when I thought I had learned the changes....you changed the jungle again, buffed and nerfed people, rinse and repeat.  I'm all for you guys fine tuning your game but it seems more like a constant cycle of breaking things and putting them back together all season than actual tweeks to gameplay. TBH I don't know how you guys didn't see that warlords was going to be broken.  As soon as someone leaked the screenshots off of PBE people knew it was going to be a problem, for the exact characters it was a problem for.  In fact you had to nerf shiv just to indirectly nerf yasuo even with the warlords changes.  I think you are going to find out that most people would rather have the % healing than 45 hp which is pretty much a single level one auto.  Late game it's negligible.  The % healing will scale with lifesteal regen everything.  You are going to turn veterans scars into noob bait. Climbing ranked is becoming who can abuse what you guys broke the most before you nerf it. Sorry for the rant.
