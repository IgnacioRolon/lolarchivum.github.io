Now if he was building pure AP and one shot me okay that&#039;s fine he built damage to do so. However, that&#039;s not the case anymore. For some unknown reason there was a Bonus HP ratio added onto his ult. Now before his E changes he wasn&#039;t that strong because he didn&#039;t have a reliable way to get onto you. Now that he has a slow onto his E it&#039;s practically impossible to get away from him.\r\n\r\ntl;dr assassin&#039;s have to build damage to do damage however they were made to have more windows of opportunity for the enemy player.

We're very much aware there are some strong opinions about Cho and Stoneplate out there and it's a topic with a range of opinions on it internally too. We talked about that particular interaction a lot before launching Stoneplate. \n> Feast's a really high true damage spell, capable of getting to around 1000 damage late game on a tank build, with Stoneplate pushing that up a few hundred more assuming a normal number of Feast stacks. That's more true damage than we'd normally be happy seeing from a champ in a single ability. Cho's got some pretty pronounced weaknesses however, in particular his long cast times, lack of mobility and limited reliability. Between those and the need to build Stoneplate, be around 3+ enemy champs and get into Feast range we concluded it was appropriate to allow the Cho/Stoneplate interaction to exist. So far that's still our take on it at present too. \n> Having said that completely agree it can definitely feel really rough being on the receiving end sometimes and Stoneplate's still pretty high on our watch list. The ability to use strong combos with it allow some pretty interesting uses and makes it appealing in a range of different circumstances. So far that seems appropriate, possible we do have to make some changes to Stoneplate and/or other things if the power of those, especially relative to their counterplay, gets out of line, whether that's Stoneplate+Cho, Stoneplate+Locket or something else again. The increased reliability Cho gets off his E slow's also noteworthy, and it's possible that while this was ok with an unreliable Q that the increased target access he's now got might prove too dominant long term.","replies":[{"poster":"Shuyin178","date":"2017-08-02T03:39:09.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ok I need to point out a few things to you.\n1.

Atleast 700 base damage on ult at level 16.\n\nThe stoneplate interaction is fine.  In order to even get the damage that Stoneplate+R does Cho needs:\n* Somewhere around 6K health outside of Stoneplate, which requires major HP items such as Cinderhulk or Warmogs, lots of stacks, and HP runes\n* Needs to be near 3 enemy champions, all of whom can interrupt him long enough for something like RG to wear off and considering how BIG Cho gets...\n* He has to get close to someone worth ulting.    This shouldn't happen without team assistance unless a carry screws up and gets hit by Q and even then peel is really strong currently.\nAll of these conditions for around 1.4k true damage.
