Usually this points to some type of connection issue.  When you are in Champion Select, the PvP.net Servers are trying to tell your client what to display.

In order to rule this out as a possible root cause, make sure to complete all of the steps in our [Connection Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).  It has the most common solutions that should get everything to appear as it should.\n\nLet me know if it doesn't work at all!","replies":[{"poster":"CorruptAura","date":"2016-06-22T03:25:01.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol its not my net, i have checked my connection when it has happened before that is the weird part it has happen to some of my friends they would click accept on queue when it pops up and they got there champ select screen black and had to close there game","replies":[]}]}]}
