These are the common reasons for consistently high ping, though the distance factor is unavoidable aside from moving or switching servers.\n\nIf you'd like to see where your high ping begins, you can run a tracert as per the [Network Guide here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs). If the issue appears to start from your end then you may be able to improve your connection by following the steps on the [Connection Troubleshooting Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).\n\nLet us know if you need assistance, and how the troubleshooting goes.","replies":[{"poster":"FalleNx","date":"2016-08-08T14:32:34.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, i'm leaving near the server - i get usually 79 m/s.
