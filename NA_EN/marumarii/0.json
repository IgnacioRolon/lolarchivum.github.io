ARAM's RNG is truly random from the champions you own + the free weekly rotation champs. There is no weighting on any groups or champs whatsoever. When using a reroll, you obviously can't reroll a champ that someone on your team already has, so the system randoms again from your remaining pool (you are also guaranteed to not reroll the exact same champion again, so your pool is technically n-1). Rerolled champs go back into the available pool for everyone else to random if they use any subsequent rerolls.","replies":[{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2015-01-10T16:34:51.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=L4T3NCY,realm=NA,application-id=LFfTlAky,discussion-id=EGAvXiuu,comment-id=000500010002,timestamp=2015-01-10T00:10:40.346+0000)\n>\n> I wrote a detailed explanation of how ARAM's champ RNG works last year on the old boards.
