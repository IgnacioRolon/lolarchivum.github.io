I just noticed that I got my 999th win and was curious if I could win my 1000th with Riot. I have B-tier memes and play Bard/Nunu.\r\n\r\nAnd if you aren't a rioter and wanna play with someone who has B-tier memes and plays Bard/Nunu, hit me up!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-07-26T04:44:11.099+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only B-tier memes, huh?

Sad news though, I'm too addicted to the game to not play on some of my only free days, so I already got my 1000th win D:\n\nIf you're still up for B-tier memes though, hit me up, I'm b1naryb0t on NA. Weekdays are most of the time I'm free.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-07-27T19:42:00.928+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ut ohhhh. That's cool, we can still play.
