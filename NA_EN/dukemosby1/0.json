It makes no logical sense to occur. It's a ridiculous mechanic that necessarily gives an Ezreal player an advantage. Given his current level of popularity, it's actually an ideal time to fix this long-ignored issue.\n\nTo the point - I'm practically certain that Riot did not release Ezreal with the thought that his shift would work this way. It was something that just happened to occur due to how things were programmed, and over time Riot decided that they \"liked it\". Perhaps because a lot of ADCs hate on Blitzcrank and leaving them with a champion that could effectively ignore his main ability was a better solution than removing or unfairly nerfing the champion. Who knows. It seems very unlikely that Riot made Ezreal with this mechanic \"intended\" though. Much more likely that it was an accident that they've just happened to support.\n\nExactly like Ahri's charm. It was an accident, as should now be obvious since they \"fixed\" it. They only fixed it though, because people started complaining about how strong Ahri was. In actuality, the mechanic was fine and was something pretty neat and unique about her and that's probably why it stuck for so long. \n\nJust my 2 cents at least. This is not intended, it's just something Riot has chosen to accept as part of normal gameplay. It's no different than saying that AFKs are intended, they aren't - but the fact that you don't get loss prevented when you have one is normal and acceptable gameplay (as you still get a win when enemies have one, and introducing loss prevented or mercy on AFKs would introduce a slew of other problems - although I don't want to thread hijack so I won't get further in to that).","replies":[{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2016-04-01T02:27:41.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"it is intended most likely because if it worked the way you think it should, a slower reaction on arcane shift would actually be rewarded compared to a faster one where you get hooked at the same time. ezreal's e isn't stopped by anything other than death once it's cast. you're just gonna have to get over it lol","replies":[{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2016-04-01T12:34:33.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd say just the opposite.\n\nCurrently the speed that results in this mechanic requires the ezreal player casting before the hook hits. If it were an instant cast without the reaction, he'd outright dodge the hook (however, the blitz player would have the ability to predict the blink and still hit the hook, which in my opinion is desirable counterplay). \n\nA slower speed would result in him being hooked, and unable to cast the ability while being dragged in. He could blink after the hook (potentially dodging the knockup) but would not be able to exit the hook displacement unless he first used cleanse/QSS before applying his blink (as one can currently do with flash).","replies":[{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2016-04-01T20:25:03.505+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sounds awful \n\nBait out e or otherwise accept that ezreal is a decent counter pick to blitz","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sqkerg","date":"2016-04-01T00:58:52.679+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":8,"body":"Sorry to spoil your fun time but Riot decides what is intended, if they say it is, it is.
