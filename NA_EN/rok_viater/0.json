Every year around this time it gets exceedingly hard to climb because everyone seems to want that next rank. But this year seems especially brutal as a Solo Player, I'm wondering if it's just me.  I usually play until I lose like 2-3 games and then play something else but usually i have more wins than losses. But this week, Every day I log on i feel like I lose my first three ranked games because I get those people who are uncarryable. almost all my recent wins were in normal matches.  I'm not normally one to blame my team, and I know i made mistakes in these games. But I've been getting some of the most toxic and clueless people recently.  Toxic people I normally try to talk down, that's not working. Clueless people normally listen to pings if you let them know why not to do something, that's not working.  I was in high gold (now Gold 5 again) but every match feels like I'm back in bronze 5, No useful communication or teamwork.  Anyone else having this problem? or do I just have to watch my games again and it's just me.","replies":[{"poster":"Dragfin","date":"2016-10-07T14:18:59.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Grinding is a term that was invented by the casual player. Play the game and learn, you rank up. Don't play the game or don't learn anything when you do play the game, you don't rank up. It's that simple.\n\nIf you don't have the time or you can't manage your time then you are a casual gamer and want things given to you without working for what so many other players have worked for.\n\nThe casual gamer will create excuses as to why they don't rank up to try and hide this fact.\n\nI am silver 4 and will stay silver 4 because I don't play ranked. It has not one damn thing to do with the players I play with. It's all on me.","replies":[{"poster":"ROK Viater","date":"2016-10-08T03:07:56.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean last season i was Plat 1, this season i'm gold 5 your argument doesn't really make sense because I'm still playing everyday like i have been.  So if I was good enough to be plat 1 last season but now i'm not even able to get plat 5 is it really all on me? or did something else change? oh.. it did, dynamic que.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2016-10-07T14:21:35.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So far it seems slightly better to me, but yeah, the season gets worse after the Victorious skin is announced.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-10-07T08:26:21.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk, I think it's the end season gatekeeping from everyone.","replies":[]}]}
