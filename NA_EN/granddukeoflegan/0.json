It could be due to an issue with security certificates or even due to another setting blocking this connection. Given the error message is pretty generic, make sure that you complete all of the steps in our [Login Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761944-Login-Issues).  While these steps commonly fix these login errors, by no means am I saying that this is purely on your end; but at the very least it will allow us to rule out some root causes so we can narrow it down.\n\nIf this error message is still a constant source of despair, often causing a string of harsh statements directed at the client, then don't let it win this war just yet!  Make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to one of our Tech Specialists so we can take a deeper look and get this resolved ASAP.

Windows 7...\n\nI've noticed a quick fix is to disable (apply) then re-enable (apply) SSL 3.0 in the internet options. Super annoying to have to do that ever single time I want to play, but it works for now. (Note this doesn't seem to work until you fail to log in once, sometimes doesn't work multiple times, sometimes works w/ disabling peer to peer xfers, sometimes works with re-enabling peer to peer. Idk. Its super annoying).\n\nI would also LOVE to point out something super interesting here. I'm having this problem on two DIFFERENT computers, connected to the same network/router/modem. So it doesn't seem like it's something client based... Any help would be appreciated.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Presto XI","date":"2015-02-10T21:31:46.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same issue.  WIn 7.
