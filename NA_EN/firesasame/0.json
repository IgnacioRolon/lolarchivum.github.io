It always gets lost. **So I would suggest to Riot that they implement a wishlist to the league store**, especially for the skins. I know a lot of people who find wishlists helpful, kinda like how you put games on your steam wishlist. If anything it helps organize things and makes them easy to find, especially people with bad memory, since there are a ton of skins and not everyone wants them all.

I could see some other benefits as well, such as friends being able to see which skins you secretly want before sending you a gift. I'll do my best to pass this along, but you should pop this idea over in the [**Client Discussion**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) to see how the devs and other players feel about it!","replies":[{"poster":"Firesasame","date":"2017-08-21T19:09:30.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Comment on other discussion](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion/TJp2WQEL-wishlists?comment=0001)\n\nHey! \nThanks for the suggestion! Broporo. I put up the same post in Client Discussions last week.\nAlthough, it looks like it is one discussion that gets overlooked. Which is why I linked my comment on the other one here for you to check out. I did a search for 'wishlist' and it actually turned up a lot of results. I thought it was rather interesting because most don't have any comments, mostly 2-3 if they do have any, and you can see the interest is there!\n\n****edit\nI realized I could just put the link here instead of you going to the comment...... and then the link... MY BAD!\n[wishlist search](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/search?query=wishlist&amp;content_type=discussion)","replies":[]}]}]}
