They were there before the blue essence changes, and there afterwards. Were they apart of that blue essence shop?\r\n\r\nThey aren't under the champions tab, nor under the hextech crafting tab. If it's not there, that's sad, but I'd like to know.","replies":[{"poster":"Valeeva","date":"2017-12-10T20:29:55.430+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately they were part of the Blue Essence Shop, so they are gone for now (if the store ever returns).","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-11T02:40:25.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These were in fact tied to the Blue Essence Emporium now.
