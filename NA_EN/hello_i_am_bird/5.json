Riot needs to get their shit together or fix this or I&#039;m quitting League!&quot;\r\nWhen mages are buffed &quot;Mages are way too strong. I can&#039;t believe that Riot buffed them so much. Riot needs to get their shit together or I&#039;m quitting League!&quot;\r\n\r\nWhen assassins are strong &quot;Oh my god, Riot I get deleted in .4 seconds, it&#039;s so unfair and there&#039;s no counterplay! Gut them and leave them to rot, I don&#039;t even care.&quot;\r\nWhen said assassins get nerfed &quot;Riot, you went way too hard on these poor fellows. I can&#039;t even play them anymore they&#039;re so bad&quot;\r\n\r\nI get that there are meta shifts and some champion will always be fotm, that&#039;s kinda the point of fotm. But oh my god, you people need to make up your minds.\r\nOverall, the gameplay boards don&#039;t know how to leave shit alone. If a champion does well in their lane when played correctly, then that champion is FINE. If another champion is stronger for doing less work, that&#039;s a problem with that champion. I hope I&#039;m not the only one that wants Riot to nerf instead of buff everyone.\r\n\r\nWhen I think of this, I remember S5 when Riot was nerfing everyone, and people were up in arms. They said they would much rather have champions buffed than nerfed. Now in S6, everyone is complaining about too much damage.\r\n\r\nIt just feels like Gameplay wants to find something to complain about and circlejerk about. Perhaps that&#039;s the natural way of the boards, but can we all just chill out a little bit, take a step back, and assess how things REALLY are and carefully think about our balance ideas before we go spewing them onto half the Hot page.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-10-17T07:47:41.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the problem with people with biased opinions. Like some hate assassins; I think almost every assassin is pretty weak unless they get a huge lead, but people will call me stupid because i don't agree with their opinions. i'd much rather face any assassin right now than let's say...

I'm on the side with assassins being poorly designed. When ahead, they make it so that one person doesn't get to play the game, plus a lot of extra damage on other targets. I'm fine with them deleting someone and all, but the fact that they tend to act more of a sustained damage dealer with occasional burst isn't fun. Now, on the inverse, if they are behind, THEY ARE BEHIND. \n\nSome assassins aren't fun to play against, Leblanc, I'm looking at you. And you're right, mages were okay, but people wanted to play assassins more than mages, and mages have an inherent disadvantage there. The majority of the player base just wants a balanced game, but that's hard to do in this. There will always be people complaining, but there's nothing wrong as long as there is evidence.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Troll Armada","date":"2016-10-17T07:11:47.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that's kind of what keeps this game interesting....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Glowshtick","date":"2016-10-17T07:10:50.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"DON'T YOU TELL ME HOW TO LIVE MY LIFE\n\n_flips table_","replies":[]},{"poster":"Digital Daddy","date":"2016-10-17T07:08:33.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is so true","replies":[]}]}
