It can perform any game at almost max graphics (which should make League a piece of cake)\n\nHowever league is the only game that i've had issues with so far, the screen gets jagged and shakes around the character. \n\nIt has honestly been the leading factor in me not returning to League and to make matters worse. I have this new 23\" monitor and I cannot for the life of me get the game to be at a far away distance from the screen anymore, everything is SUPER zoomed up. \n\nI've tried everything, changing settings from 1920x1080 to every other one. Either the mouse size stays MASSIVE and it's all messed up and goes windowed, or the minimap goes bonkers.\n\nI just want the game to look like it did on my small laptop but run better (like it should)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-27T03:53:35.769+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like there may be some issues in your configuration file saved server-side. We should be able to resolve this if you perform a reset of this file with the steps below:\n\nFirst off, I'd like you to **log into League** then jump to your config folder, which should be in the following directory:\n\n>**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config**\n\nDelete the following files:\n>**- input.ini** \n>**- PersistedSettings.json**\n\nOnce you've deleted those files, hop into a custom match to confirm the changes went through for you. Please let me know if this resolved your issue or not.","replies":[{"poster":"xXMrPeanutXx","date":"2016-12-27T06:13:16.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply.\n\nI found said files and deleted them, restarted the client, started up a custom game but nothing seems to have changed. The resolution still has the character really close to the screen and the hero get jagged and shakes while moving around. I tinkered around a bit in customs some more but couldn't figure anything out","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-27T21:50:31.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn, that sucks. :/\n\nWe'll need to take a close look at your system logs in order to troubleshoot this further, so I recommend we escalate this to our super-savvy tech team!
