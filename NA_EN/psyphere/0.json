Consider pantheon's stun. By your thinking, it should stun Fizz mid-air as well. But Fizz e counters Pant stun.\n\nOn the other hand Blitz's E is a skill that empowers his next basic attack. So I'd imagine it would be treated as a basic attack mechanic too. Apperantly, Riot disagrees.\n\nEdit: A similar skill is Fizz w, for example. They both reset the aa (auto attack) timer and empower next aa. But once fizz w starts winding up, I don't think he would land the aa on another fizz, like blitz does. Neither should he, imo.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
