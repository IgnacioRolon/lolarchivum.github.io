I've played since 2010, but for a long time, I felt like I still didn't understand the finer points of the game - this series is really awesome for explaining things like where to stand while CSing, what to do in team fights, and the nuances of each lane.

Best jungle path I've found, and take almost every game. Take your buff (red is absolute best for this strat unless your champ straight up can't function wihtout blue like amumu or fiddlesticks, for this we will assume you started red), don't use smite on the opening buff just tough it out, go immediately to the enemy blue. Here you will have about three options. 1) the enemy blue is still there, ward across the jun wall and proceed to take the blue\n2) the blue is gone. In this case go around the corner to their gromp. Most of the time you'll find some goofball there with no smite left up cause he used it on blue and something like 1/3rd remaning health. Use your smite on the gromp to get your hp back once it's in kill range while you proceed to beat the piss out of the other jungler. They either die or bail, not much else they can do.\n3) there is no blue and gromp is still there. Just clear their jun. You might find them at wolves. If so, treat it like step 2. On your way out grab the scuttle. ALWAYS GRAB THE SCUTTLES.\n\nafter that you can basically just do whatever you want in whichever jungle as long as you are aware of enemy laner locations. Don't be afraid to use dashes and gap closers to cross walls instead of going around. Backtrack as little as possible, and always be looking for chances to fuck with enemies, especially their jun. Your job isn't so much to kill enemies and take things as it is to try to tilt as many enemies off the face of the planet as you possibly can. Also, enemies who talk in all chat (except the really light hearted people that are obviously just having a good time with the full game of players, you can tell the difference) are more likely to rage.

My friends have been playing for upwards two years (and more), but I usually end up telling them what to build; they're playing video games, not reading about that kid we learned of in math class. Half the items in the game are goddam percentages, nobody wants to sit there and work that out, or decide if 30% is going to be helpful or a waste of money.\n\nThe big issue is League's community. Wanting to improve, learning, all these things-- when they're not tryhard, they're simply unanswered. I've literally been in games trying to actively engage the other four players to try and find what we can do to win only to be met by total silence.\n\nLeague's community is trash. It's absolute goddam garbage, where you can get shit for doing well. In no other game has doing well been responded to with negativity on my own team. But in League, it'll happen. Just because the players are that puerile and shitty.\n\nThe new experience is largely what you make of it bringing players in. Lucky me, I've been playing MOBA-styled maps since about 2005 or 2006; coming to League in 2013 for S3 was about as easy a transition as any, though it took me a good year to wrap my head around build orders, priorities, and how to properly deal with Lux. When I brought my players in, I stressed a simple idea; it's better to live than to die in virtually any situation.\n\nThere is no 'new player experience' in League. Smurfs, bot accounts, trolls, and more new people who only sort of have a vague idea of what's going on. It's a nightmare and Riot doesn't want to acknowledge it because they're having troubles enough dealing with the game at the upper echelons-- over a hundred items and champions means balance is going to be a complete mess whatever happens. None of the commanding concepts ever get an explanation, but you get flamed if you don't adhere to them. You ever seen someone running something totally meta and thought, \"God, they just have no idea how to do that\"? Youtubers are as close to explanations as you get and they'll be a reference at best, but since it's an answer, it's what people take. There's more to the game than any one component, but they don't ever treat it like the sum of its parts; they take parts separately. Like bots.\n\nLeague of Legends is breaking. They refuse to admit it because it would look bad; they refuse to do anything because of the sheer work put ahead of that task. It will slowly fade out over the next two years, before it meets a quiet, unfortunate end. Not with a bang, but with a fizzle and a pop. Like pop rocks!

He'd probably only been playing for like a month when he referred me. I legit went Sivir mid in a bot custom with him, did next to nothing, and watched the Zilean bot carry us hard. He made a joke I didn't get once about Galio support, and the instant Galio came on free week I played like three games a day of Galio support, rushing Athene's after Targon's Brace and then just like stacking health and mana regen because I didn't like the idea of running out of stuff and because I had really bad mana problems because I was using Q and E for waveclear as the support (and I expect you know how bad old Galio's mana costs could be if you didn't respect them). Hit mastery 4 like that. Then he left free week and I mained Janna playing her like she was Sion. I always charged my Q. Can't remember if I even knew that I could release it early. I just left it in the middle of lane and hoped it hit someone at max range. Always used W active to proc Spellthief's, never basic attacked. I never peeled either, I just went straight in. I'd just walk into the enemy team (pretty sure I didn't have Flash unlocked yet) and try to knock them into my team with ult. Meanwhile I was trying to do a full clear as AD Zilean jungle in a custom, because I thought his Q was only useful for clearing the jungle, and even if I landed it on someone it did seemingly no damage; I actually thought that having an AoE stun was like a prerequisite for being able to jungle healthily because the only jungler I'd ever watched clear was Ekko. Furthermore, I couldn't navigate the shop at all, so I just got an item set for everything off mobafire if I couldn't think of one myself, including three for Kassadin, whom I immediately committed to mastering. Five games after buying him blind I realized that I was the worst Kassadin player in the history of the game because I couldn't manage his mana and I always went in hard on everything as soon as I hit level 6, used Q to farm, always held E really long, and thought his passive and Q shield made him literally unkillable by mages. Later, I bought Galio and actually figured out that I wasn't good at him. Somewhere along the line I bought Swain on patch 6.9, and that's about where I \"stopped being bad\".

And when smurfs get tilted at them (because thats how the league community works) they just lose all desire to even be a part of the team.\n\nIn recent weeks I stopped queuing with anyone. Only solo. And muting my team, because 70% of the games are nothing but ragetards in all chat talking about \"report jungler no ganks.\" and \"omg youre playing Orianna, your a shitter.\" and everyone's favorite statement, \"GG no counterplay.\"\n\nLeague is terrible for new players. And opening ranked to them at level 30? Yeah throw all these new people in bronze that have zero clue how a game works so they all last 45 minutes and go either way. That's Elo hell. (Not there anymore thankya jesus.)\n\nThe LEAST riot could do is add an encyclopedia page where all the info on league is, like creep strengths, jungle camps, tower mechanics, etcc.","replies":[{"poster":"Pinkaj","date":"2017-06-07T03:28:38.868+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed.\nThat's why guides exist.\nBut they aren't by Riot :/","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Legacy Hydralpha","date":"2017-06-06T23:33:06.599+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"[EVERYTHING IS REVEALED.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6fhetu/i_found_out_why_the_tutorial_gives_you_thornmail/)\n\nTL;DR: Thornmail helps new players fight against Trundle and keep their minion wave pushed ahead.
