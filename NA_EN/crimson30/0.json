I just can't see any other explanation.  I live alone... nobody's going to break into my house and only mess with my League of Legends client.\n\nIt's almost funny that the person who closed the second ticket commented that \"the suspension was justified\".  There's this subtext of certainty laced in the support responses that makes me wonder what sort of \"investigation\" they do; I'm guessing none.  I do wonder what I've done that's so different from any other random new player.  Given how little I played, I wouldn't be surprised that this happens frequently and most people probably just don't bother fighting it.","replies":[]}]}
