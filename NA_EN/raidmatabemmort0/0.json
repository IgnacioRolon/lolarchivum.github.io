What about discouraging that behaviour?\n\nWhat about including another option in the \"Honour Page\"? You could include a \"Prevent this player from earning League Points\" option. If all teammates vote for that, the troll player would end with ZERO League Points for that win and a notification.

All it took for you to label somebody as toxic is that person disagreeing with you.\nThere are more than enough people who confuse disagreement on strategy (or even just bad stats) with trolling.\n\nThe largest problem, though, is that this will affect people unevenly. If everybody had the same chance to become a false positive under this system it would still feel shitty, but at least it would be balanced out.\nBut that's not the case:\n- Players who go for less popular strategies (no matter how viable) are more likely to run into people who disagree with them.\n- Supports that lack any flashy abilities will find it less easy to defend themselves against people claiming they are useless.\n- High risk, high reward champions run a high risk to get less LP because of \"feeding\", while their high reward still only nets them regular LP.\nI hope those are enough to convey my point. If not, I'm sure I can come up with more.\n\nAnd just so we are clear here: I'm not even talking about people abusing the system. I'm talking about situations where people might actually feel *justified* in their use of the system. The chance that people may intentionally screw over people they believe to be innocent is a whole problem of its own.","replies":[{"poster":"RaidMataBemMort0","date":"2019-05-20T15:58:31.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think there is a difference between \"you are\" or \"a big chance you are\".

People who can't see why somebody might be doing badly through no fault of their own, or why somebody might have made a certain decision (especially if that decision backfired), or why somebody might pick a certain championâ€¦ or even just why somebody might just legitimately be bad at one part of the game.\n\nAnd when you give people who are unable/unwilling to actually understand another person's motivation the direct power to judge other players at the push of a button bad things are bound to happen.\n\nOne other thing I until now struggled to put in words:\nThe safety guard for requiring four votes doesn't work as well against those cases, either. That's because even if we consider the votes to be independent in a colloquial sense, they are definitely not independent in a statistical sense.\nPeople don't just randomly decide that somebody is a troll. There is always something (even if that something is a misconception, misunderstanding or otherwise inconclusive) that sparks somebody's suspicion. And even if we ignore how common scapegoats and bandwagons are, the chance that all four players come to the same (possibly wrong) conclusion because of that thing that happened is still going to be fairly high.\n\nEdit: Going to add in some made up numbers to help convey my point more rigorously. Just might take a bit.\n\nEdit2: Here we go. Let's say the chance of a randomly picked player **falsely** suspecting another player to be trolling is about 5%.\nNow if this was a completely random mistake, your safeguard would lower the chance of somebody being punished false positively to an incredibly low number. After all you need to have this happen four times \"in a row\".\nSo the chance for a proper false positive punishment would be 0.05 \\* 0.05 \\* 0.05 \\* 0.05 = 0.000625%\nThat's one in 160.000\n\nBut the suspicion is not a random mistake. This 5% chance is comprised of very specific events that cause the suspicion.\nLet's say, for the sake of the argument that 90% of the time somebody picks Teemo, that person is falsely suspected of trolling by a random player. Teemo has a pick rate of 2%, meaning about one third of the cases of false suspicion by one player are Teemo picks.\n\nHere's where it gets interesting: \nYou have a 2% chance of Teemo being picked, and then a 90% chance to the power of four that all other four players suspect that pllayer of trolling. That yields 0.02 \\* 0.9 \\* 0.9 \\* 0.9 \\* 0.9 = 1.3%\nThat's one in 76. Our false positive rate has just sky-rocketedâ€¦ and so far we only took a closer look at about one third of the cases.\n\nWorse still: If **you** decide to pick Teemo, the chance that somebody picks Teemo isâ€¦ wellâ€¦ 100%. And Teemo's pick rate is an incredibly important factor. The chance that any Teemo is suspected of trolling by all four other players is 0.9 \\* 0.9 \\* 0.9 \\* 0.9 = **65.6%**.\n\nObviously the numbers I used here are completely made upâ€¦ but I'm not trying to estimate the actual chance of false positives; I don't even think I would be able to. I just want to highlight why requiring four votes is not necessarily as strong a safeguard as it may sound intuitively. Mostly because our intuition is typically based on simplified and generalized statistical averages.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-05-20T01:13:38.331+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is just a way for four players to gang up on a teammate.
