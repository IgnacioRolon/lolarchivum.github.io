Also, most successful ashes don't get very many kills, rather, they have far more assists than most adc's. Which may be another reason for her current unpopularity. Kills are satisfying, and not getting kills on a role who's job is to do dmg feels kinda lousy.","replies":[{"poster":"Whitakker","date":"2015-03-20T13:40:16.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hence why Ashe is commonly termed a \"utility ADC\".  Her damage is outstripped by most other marksmen, but she brings a ton of usefulness to the teamfight with her hard/soft cc and vision.\n\nAnd a competent Ashe player is an absolute nightmare to lane against.
