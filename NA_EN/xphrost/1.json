However after the screen disappears to the loading screen nothing comes up and then when i try to log out and \"reconnect\" it just does the same thing. Every time i would log out and hit reconnect it would never load i would be able to bring up the league tab and hit it over and over each time the screen would disappear but not connect. Ive gotten TWO leavers i would like to have my rank fixed and the loss' taken off, if you look at my history i do not have a tendency to leave games....EVER.","replies":[{"poster":"xPhrost","date":"2016-09-27T21:24:09.649+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi so i have still to get a reply, can someone from Riot at least acknowledge this and tell me where to go from there.....","replies":[{"poster":"xPhrost","date":"2016-09-27T21:25:56.644+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"TWO games of RANKED this happened in and all of a sudden too, i played a few games before hand which were fine then randomly it stops working and made me get TWO LOSSES AS AFK.
