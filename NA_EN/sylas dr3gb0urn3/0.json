But since the release of Tags this feels like a once a week thing.

This diagnoses means that I am NOT BI-POLAR, but can and do exhibit Bi-Polar traits based off of unique situations. ie, mother died, and i might display anger at her illness, instead of sadness at her death. ie, mother died and i might display happiness that she is no longer suffering from whatever ailment killed her, where as my siblings would be distraught.  If you think calling me Bipolar is an offensive comment towards me, when I am in fact Borderline, you are clearly mistaken. I am what I am, I am my own special creation. Understand that which you use as ammunition, before firing your gun.\n\nIn addition, this is not relevant to my post or to the conversation we are having.

They are not the same issue, they are two completely different issues. And when it comes to Names, and Tags, which is what THIS topic is about, the offended person has No way of defending themselves. There is no mute feature on the name tags. If you want to make the TWO SEPARATE issues into one, the better way rather than attacking ME, would be to post to RIOT and ask them for a NAME and TAG MUTE feature, like World of Warcraft has. However, I am not RIOT. IT's best you take it up with THEM if you want to make my two completely different statements about two completely different topics into one Bi Polar view point. Be sure to offer some solutions to the problem, you can even use my solution if you want, instead of just attacking them, like you did me, when you do it though, and do try to stay on topic when you talk to them. Have a great evening and I wish you success in your endeavor to do so.\n\nAnd when you do succeed, since I kinda do see your misguided point, Then my \"warrants change\" opinion WOULD be revised to the same as the Mute Them topic. At that point, there would be a valid way of defending myself. Until the reality of Mute Name or Tag, exists in League of Legends, then this conversation. as I have previously stated is not relevant to my original post. Furthermore, it is not relevant to the other post either. If you want to take Topic A and Topic B and create Topic C, then it needs its own unique thread, IN which TOPIC C is the sole focus.","replies":[{"poster":"Sylas Dr3gb0urn3","date":"2016-08-23T00:44:31.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was just informed that, there is indeed a NAME and TAG MUTE feature in the IN-GAME settings.
