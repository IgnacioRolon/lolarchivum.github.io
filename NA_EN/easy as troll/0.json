But what happened after my fourth game was that a notification came up and said I was in a new promotion, my record got clean up (2:2), so I will have to start it over for my promote game. You can check my match history, from December 19th the last 4 ranked games. Just thought this is a bug, so hope you guys can look into it, thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-20T19:31:04.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it sounds strange that you resulted in another series so I took a look into this.  It turns out that you've had several [queue dodges](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging)  during your series, which counts as losses.  It's important to stay in champion select and play through the game, otherwise you may need to redo your series as in this case.  Hopefully that helps clear things up!","replies":[]}]}
