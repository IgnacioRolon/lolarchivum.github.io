Azir summons soldier (W) and shurima shuffles towards the enemy (E, then Q)\r\n2. While in the Shurima shuffle, enemy roots Azir at a distance far enough away that the ult would miss.\r\n3. Since Azir is already dashing he will continue forward towards the enemy as shown in the video.\r\n4. Azir uses (R) and it passes through the enemy (presumably being treated as though it was used at the location where Azir was rooted.\r\n\r\nInclude how frequently you can get the issue to occur and any video or screenshots of the bug that might help clarify it.\r\n\r\n{{champion:268}} This is the first time I have noticed the glitch, it might have happened previously but I probably just assumed I was bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2017-07-20T23:11:51.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like you just missed it.
