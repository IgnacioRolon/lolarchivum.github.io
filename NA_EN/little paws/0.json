{"poster":"Little Paws","date":"2015-01-10T22:42:29.655+0000","title":"Nasus Playstyle","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":7,"down_votes":4,"body":"I don't know how to write this without sounding \"whiny\" so I'll do my best.\r\n\r\nFrom what I've seen from the large amount of games I've played that involved nasus in some way, his playstyle is completely linear. You ignore your lane opponent in order to farm, even if they are harassing you. Your passive, which gives you 10/15/20% lifesteal allows you to stay healthy in lane almost regardless of the amount of pressure your other laner can produce. If your under tower, it makes it easier for you to simply farm your q.\r\n\r\nAnd ultimately, that is what nasus' play style is. Ignore your laner, and farm your q. Unless your opponent is someone that is fairly oppressive ({{champion:122}} , I'm looking at you here. {{champion:17}} , I see you behind darius -_-), you will outscale them before the end of your laning phase assuming that your team does not feed horribly. \r\n\r\nThis absolutely does not feel rewarding to play against, or to play. I am an avid nasus fan, I enjoy the scaling on his q, I enjoy how his slow is unique in league, and I enjoy how his ult makes you feel unkillable. However, the play style is a problem. His laning phase is either you somehow manage to force him out of lane (which isn't happening because his sustain) or you will be almost useless to your team.\r\n\r\nBefore anyone says \"you can roam\" yes, yes you can. Doing so may net your team 1, or 2 kills, but Nasus will still be where he is. He will be farming, and a farming nasus is a problem. You can't ignore him because, lo and behold, he'll 3 shot your turret. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy problem is as thus: Nasus' playstyle rewards the player that doesn't actually want to play. It rewards the person that doesn't want to interact with their opponent, it allows gameplay to become stagnant until that player feels its time to actually play. And that shouldn't be what league is about.\r\n\r\nLeague, like it or not, is an interaction between 10 people at any given time. If your top lane, it is an interaction between those 2 people, and they should be interacting. The person that doesn't want to play shouldn't be rewarded for it, it shouldn't be \"okay\". \r\n\r\nTl;dr: I wish nasus had a different play style, one that allowed more interaction between him and whoever he's against.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to know everyone's thoughts on this. If thats a healthy play style, why? If it isn't why? I want to hear both sides.","replies":[{"poster":"SlackerboyTC","date":"2015-01-10T22:53:06.699+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"at least nasus gives you a chance unlike cough cough {{champion:84}} {{champion:105}} cough*","replies":[{"poster":"Antonidas1","date":"2015-01-11T02:50:00.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Let him stack his Q and he's worse than both...

Like it or not, it allows new players to learn to CS, without being a liability to the team.

Either him or{{champion:23}}. \n\nIts hardly toxic, if he doesn't want to interact then force him too. Its just annoying. His power is inevitable like Vayne. A lot of champs have the let's just farm play style. At least Nasus doesn't bully out the enemy level 2 and then proceeds to afk farm into an invincible juggernaut like Ryze did. If a champ is going to have that play style they really shouldn't interact heavily as it has a chance of allowing them to win lane with aggression as well as get farmed up. As well if they don't have some way to survive early game then getting farmed up is impossible. Sure Nasus is a overly simplistic version of these ideas but that mostly comes from his age. I personally don't like it but I can't call Nasus unhealthy just cause I don't like him personally.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omiwom","date":"2015-01-11T03:42:06.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's also a bad playstyle because the Nasus feels superior to everyone else and plays a sort of 'god' role.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2015-01-11T02:47:04.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Go away, you hold the assassin icon and pretend to like Nasus and playstyles.

I play at least three champs from every single role.

I don't play zed because I think he's too over powered. I don't play fizz because he allows very little counterplay.

But it's there. If you manage to kill fizz or akali, and keep them from getting kills, you'll win. If you manage to kill Nasus, he's going to go right back to farming. Good luck stopping him. That's just how it seems to me.","replies":[]}]}
