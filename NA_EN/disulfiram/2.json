(No heals, no shields, and he can't stay effective without items / with support items as well as other supports can.)\n\nThat aside, you are underestimating the value of assists and all the other sources of gold.\nThe team of that 30/0 Fizz are not gold starved from not getting the kills themselves.\nThey are also fed from assist gold, cs, and towers.\n\nYou have to realize, it's not \"your gold, teammate A's gold, etc.\"\nIt's your team's gold vs enemy team's gold.\nIt doesn't matter who gets the killshot, it's beneficial to all 5 of your team members.\nEven when you're talking about carry and support, it doesn't matter if the support happens to get the kill.\nThe carry still gets the assist, and the real gold advantage for them as an individual is from the cs they get after.\nIn more direct words, kill stealing doesn't exist.","replies":[{"poster":"HotarÂµ","date":"2019-08-09T21:32:24.801+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Couldn't have said it better myself, well done\n\n+1","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-10T04:16:41.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well that's not true.
