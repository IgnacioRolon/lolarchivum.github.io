Uninstall.

There are amazing Bronze players that just have horrible decision making when it comes to buying items. Proof is that you think sight stone is a weak item and you do \"better without it\". Vision is the key to winning 99% of all games.\n\nWhich is why you are at the rank you are. \n\nLearn and progress, refuse to learn and stagnate.","replies":[{"poster":"Ravenhale","date":"2016-04-19T18:48:12.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd argue taking objectives is the key to winning 100% of all games. I feel like I've lost many games because my ADC decided to play ARAM in the mid lane. If I don't go with, I get scolded for not helping. If I go with, I get to watch minions crush our lane while we prance around mid lane waiting for some fool to get out of position. I really don't understand this \"group mid\" mentality. It always seems to happen before death timers are long enough to even warrant a death match in the mid lane. Oh, we finally aced the team but two of them are already back up, so I guess we don't even get a turret out of this.\n\nI build Sightstone religiously and I don't believe it makes a difference to my team. It makes a difference to me, which is why I always build Trackers as a Jungler. Vision keeps me alive and helps me make good decisions. I can't vouch if it does anything for my team, since map awareness isn't the strongest trait among my fellow rifters.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nice Fellow","date":"2016-04-19T18:17:26.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After reading this I knew you were bronze, looked you up, and sure enough, you're as bronze as they come.\nMaybe the LCS support players shouldnt build ss either.{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"resumed","date":"2016-04-19T17:28:20.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the good thing about maining support is youre hardly ever going to be laning against another support main so you're likely at an advantage and you run into ludens echo nami and ancient coin leonas","replies":[]}]}
