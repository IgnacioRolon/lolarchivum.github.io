I've now uninstalled a few programs that i thought may be interfering with my connection to the servers  as well as disabling windows firewall, and now i'm able to log in instantly instead of taking 5 minutes, but i still cannot connect to chat or load the client content. Although, I was able to connect with no problems at all on a different machine that is connected to the same network. Does this mean there's a program (or a few) that are causing the problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-03T15:27:51.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the update, and I'm glad progress is being made!
