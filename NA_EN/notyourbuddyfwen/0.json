Has anyone else experienced this issue? They were literally my ONLY gifted skins and they're both missing so I'd really appreciate if a RIOT employee could help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-07T18:03:23.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey that sucks, and we definitely look into this and see what happened.
