I had this sort of issue not too long ago, sent in a support ticket, and got it sorted out.  \n\nIf the above mentioned step doesn't resolve the issue try a full repair.  If that doesn't work try deleting League's \"config\" folder completely.  For me, it turned out I actually needed to reinstall my graphics drivers to fix the problem.  Still an easy fix, just an odd one.  If none of these end up resolving your issue a Support ticket is your best bet.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
