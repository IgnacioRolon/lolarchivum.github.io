I thought it would be super fun! \r\n\r\nThen I realized that the only way I could play singed is if I queued with at least 2 other people who wanted to play singed - but this was not ideal since the other 2 random people have likely never played singed before, and thus 1. wouldn&#039;t know how to play him, and 2. would be mad that they were forced to play singed and might just troll and int.\r\n\r\nAnd the enemy team has the same issue: likely 1-2 people on the enemy team know their champions very well, and the rest are just feeding their asses off like i did in my riven game yesterday.\r\n\r\nThe result of all this is some very sub-par gameplay. If I am queued up with 5 singed mains, we dominate and win super hard. If I am playing with people who don&#039;t main singed the game is a mess and is likewise not very fun.\r\n\r\nSo please, Rito, make it so we can choose the champion we want to play in one-for-all mode, and then queue us up with other people who want to play that same champion. This would make for much more interesting and fun games, and we could actually test which match-ups favour which champions, instead of just seeing if the 1 person who mains the champion on their team can carry harder than the other person on the opposing team.","replies":[{"poster":"legendarygoo","date":"2016-11-26T21:13:09.173+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you say \"choose the champion we want to play in one-for-all mode, and then queue us up with other people who want to play that same champion\", wouldn't that take a long time?

Map pressure is map pressure, the 3/1/2 was probably pushing lanes and not fighting as much as the other singed. Also Protobelt on singed is bad, so there goes your evidence on the \"best\" build?  The 3/14 and the 3/7 did worse than he did, and that's not accounting for anything that happened in the game.
