A computer does all this now, correct?\r\n\r\nSo, how does it \"scan\" chat logs for toxic players? Does it only scan for curse words? If so, then as long as a player does not swear, then he or she won't get caught... right? \r\n\r\nHow does the system recognize a toxic person who does not use swear words?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-31T03:56:13.120+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't go into too many details as to how the system works, as that would give players the golden keys to how to avoid it entirely xD! I can say however, there are words and phrases that can be automatically detected and flag your account for action. Beyond that, there are some cases that might need to be manually reviewed after receiving reports.","replies":[{"poster":"XxTexanCowgirlxX","date":"2017-07-31T03:58:11.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha this is true! But in general, if a player avoids using the basic toxic language, they can never be punished, correct? Because the system will never recognize it. \n\nI had this guy flame me all game, yet he never swore, and he was so proud of himself bc my report would mean nothing. :(","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-01T00:20:37.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if they aren't using foul language, they can still be reported in the post game lobby if they are harassing you.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
