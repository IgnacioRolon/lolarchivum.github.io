An example would be the new Battle Professor Graves skin. His hair changes color, his clothes change color, and his gun changes color. If I own a chroma where his hair is black and one where his hair is white, I should be able to choose which hair color I want. Obviously this wouldn't work for all skins with chromas (Like Zac who is primarily 1 color), but It would be a cool new feature that would definitely sell more Chromas.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-05-14T20:28:40.190+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be a technical nightmare that would likely require a lot more work under the hood that you expect, and cater to a very small number of players - it would be neat, but dont count on it ever happening.","replies":[{"poster":"Logang4Lyyfe","date":"2019-05-14T22:06:51.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't agree that it would cater to a small number of players.
