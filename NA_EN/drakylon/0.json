Mordekaiser 98 (or so) % ban rate? Juggernauts dominating every game? All stemming from a considerable rework that drastically changed the landscape of the game, released _right before_ Worlds.\r\n\r\nAnd now you&#039;re releasing a completely reworked champion **on the very same patch that Worlds is going to be played on.** This means you&#039;re going to be unleashing a completely unbalanced (PBE and internal playtesting are not such great places to get a good read on balance) and potentially buggy (PBE and internal playtesting aren&#039;t perfect at catching bugs either) champion into the biggest League event of the year. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the Yorick rework introduces a few unique mechanics for which we&#039;ve yet to establish a good standard of balance.\r\n\r\nRiot, Worlds is not a good place to introduce a fresh new champion to the world; at least, not in competitive matches. The best case scenario, that Yorick is well-balanced and bug-free, is not only the least likely but also still has its issues: Your pro players will have a limited amount of time to prepare for this new champion as people work on finding the optimal way to build and play him. And then there&#039;s the more likely scenarios. The first, that Yorick is drastically underpowered and therefore ignored, is relatively harmless. But the worst cases -- the Juggernaut case, a buggy mess, or both -- can potentially be disastrous for both the players and the spectators.\r\n\r\nRiot, I urge you to either devote a hotfix patch to at least attempting to balance Yorick before Worlds, or, preferably, disable the reworked Yorick for this event. I doubt anyone wants to see another repeat of last year&#039;s Worlds.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2016-09-12T07:10:51.938+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"We were worried about that sort of thing.
