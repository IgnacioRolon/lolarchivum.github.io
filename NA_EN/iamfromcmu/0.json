But, only one champion - Master Yi - is a big balance breaker in the game. Because Master Yi has one of the best avoiding skills, it is impossible to kill Master Yi in the late games. Also, when Yi uses his Ultimate, it seems that his Q skill cooldown also gets reduced, which makes him almost immune to all the damage. \r\n\r\nTherefore, I argue that Yi's Q cooldown should be nerfed in ARURF/URF, unless this mode will be very disgusting game for those who faces Master Yi.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading my argument and feel free to talk please.","replies":[]}
