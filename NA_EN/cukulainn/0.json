I listened to them not expecting much. It's hard for me to get into new music. What I heard blew my mind. It's all I've been listening to for the past week.\nI love pentakill and would absolutely love another album. I've shown it to some of my friends... They love it too. Some of them don't even play league. \nKudos dev team. You outdid yourselves with this one. Truly amazing music.\nI would also buy shirts and other merchandise.

Enjoying a melody, or enjoying a song that has more or less melody, is indeed subjective, but the post I was responding to was saying that most metal simply doesn't have any, which is a false statement.\n\nThis thread is a bit like saying \"I wasn't really into neo-realistic still life art before, but this stuff is great!
