Troll or late game carry?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"(FIRST POST SO IF I GET THE BOARD WRONG IM SORRY) I was Veigar support and had saw nothing wrong with the idea, until a couple minutes ago. I went into a Draft game mode and got flamed by 3 of my teammates 5 minutes in. Two of these players were queued and decided it&#039;d be a good idea to just mock my gameplay and the fact I was &quot;trolling&quot; because of my champion pick. Trying to assure the team that I have played Veigar support in the past, they proceeded with the salt and claimed that our team had lost from the beginning because my choice of support. I did report these players at the end of the game, with the enemy team leaning on my side throughout the situation. However, I wanted to know your guys&#039; opinions on Veigar support. I have read a few threads to why Veigar support isn&#039;t entirely a bad idea, but why is it hated so much? Or perhaps, were these people just trolling me?\r\n\r\nI will be leaving a poll here, although you guys can continue to post your inputs.\r\n\r\nThank you guys.","replies":[{"poster":"Ryagi","date":"2017-02-12T05:18:38.254+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} Any champion can play any role as long as you know what you are doing and you are not in friken lcs master tier where they will instantly prove to you why veiger shouldn't support.

Because even if they dont initially get hit by the stunring.. they are stuck inside it, so draven almost cant miss his knockaside... which also then knocks them into the stunring :-D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Proxy345","date":"2017-02-12T05:28:48.404+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"His E is so much easier to walk out of than it used to be in the past because of the delay.

You don't end up with the legendary 1200 ap, but you do end up with 200-400 ap, and a fair amount of tank/cd.  You also shouldn't use your ult, as it becomes more of a panic button to save your adc in a duel, or pick up one that'l get away (no cast time woot).\n\nbasically, its all about your mindset","replies":[]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-02-12T06:11:42.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it depends on how you play it.  if you took Dring and are stealling your adcs farm, then troll.  if you took a gold gen item, are harassing enemy laners and setting up wards/kills then support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alex h8721","date":"2017-02-12T05:18:37.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its ok for a passive farming lane but not necessarily w/ an adc like draven who wants to snowball, veigs E is much better for stopping an all in than hitting an offensive stun","replies":[]}]}
