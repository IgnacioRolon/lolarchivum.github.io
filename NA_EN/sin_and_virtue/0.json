People can troll and feed a game all they want, and all they have to do is either not say anything, or feign innocence with something like &quot;sorry guys :( lagging&quot;. But the moment I say something to the troll that could be considered rude? I get a chat restriction, I get a temp ban, etc.\r\n\r\nWhy is there not some sort of system that allows the mods to view a game&#039;s footage, so they can catch these trolls and punish them properly? Why are they allowed to do whatever they want, but I can&#039;t call someone a feeding b*tch, without getting banned?\r\n\r\nI just got a 2 week temp ban for cussing a guy out because he was purposely feeding, running into towers, following me around in the jungle and messing with me, taking my jungle camps, etc. Yet nothing happened to him despite him ruining the match for my team. EVERYBODY in the enemy team was on his side, saying he was just having fun and I was in the wrong for cussing him out. Why is that okay? Do people not have balls anymore? Can nobody handle some cuss words when they&#039;re ruining everyone else&#039;s game?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-01-30T05:25:15.539+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":4,"body":"We do have systems for detecting intentional feeder, and they work pretty well.
