I'm tired of Cait and Jhin most of the time.\n\nAlso, Now ADCs can appreciate their supports more instead of being a bit selfish, now that ADCs are the new Support to some extent.\n\nHowever, ADC itemization needs to be looked at so that we dont see former Marksmen running from the lane into other lanes and ADC/Bot being the new supp. Would be hilarious if you longer get Supp 90-95% of the time if you have Supp second, Fill second, or Fill primary.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2017-01-08T18:44:06.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meddler is going to nerf the jungle and see how ADC's do after that.

If they make jungle camps give any less gold or xp, top is going to turn into a duo lane.  \n\nThe real issue I think is that adc builds have been stagnant for pretty much forever.  Glass cannon every time.  Early they're too weak,  late they're arguably too strong. \n\nIf Riot takes action it should only be to fix these two extremes.  In the meantime, bot lane can start building a hexdrinker like everyone else who builds AD into an AP match up.  Give maw back its armor pen and boom, you've got something to work with against mage adcs that helps your overall build goals. \n\nSimply put its a different lane that requires different adaptations. At present that means building a hexdrinker and maybe merc treads if theres enough cc to warrant it.","replies":[{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2017-01-08T19:46:46.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well they also got rid of the on-hit from fervor too and took armor pen away from a lot of spell based ADCs so thats another reason thers so few strong ADCs rn","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-01-08T19:30:36.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it's unsustainable to be an immobile glass cannon when there's so much damage flying around.
