I don&#039;t see how this is Random. I would expect to see more of the other champions in my collection to make an appearance, and not see the same one over and over and over again. They should add an algorithm to prevent the same champ from appearing more than once every 3 or 4 games, cause this is getting rediculous.","replies":[{"poster":"ViciousSummoner","date":"2018-03-11T06:28:23.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's usually always like that.
