Sometimes the game crashed but I would have enough time to re-log in and pick my champion or ban, but the problem is I can never go back to the original room when I tried to re-log in. I would stay at the home page and the client will tell me I am already in the game... Just please someone let me know how can I solve this problem, this is so hurting when I was doing ranked game.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-14T04:54:13.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Crashes in champ select are largely caused by connection issues to our servers caused by an *unstable connection*.
