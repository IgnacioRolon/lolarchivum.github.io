I'd like to see how RIOT working on their beautifull game, but i can't understand whats going with thir servers and support. After great fix EUW in June i have 1 DC every 3-5 ranked games. This is more then annoing. I cant play and have no fun anymore. I sent 3 tickets to support and has answers like \"check ur firewall\", connect to ur ISP and execute connection tests.\nI done all i can.\n1) I have no firewall. And yes, i disable Windows firewall at all.\n2) Send them game logs, tracerts and connection test results. No technical responce about they gave me, but i still want to see something like \"by the text of log we can say server is not respond to client by some reason, we can check the reasons\".\nI even start to understand what happening inside game by myself just reading the logs.\n3) Reinstall LOL\n4) Connect to my ISP to sure my inet is stable. Ofc it is stable, coz all internet services r online and working fine.\n5) I disable IPv6\n6) I switched to public DNS 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4\n\nHow can u blame my internet or computer if i had no this bug before server changes? And yes, i changed NOTHING on my side about 2 years.\n\nWhat kind of dancing with tambourine i have to do more to play this game without afraid of free loose, raging and reporting me by my teammates for this bug? I will do it surely, or just give me to leave this new fixed server.\n\nThank u for understanding and supporting this thread, it may help thousands of people.\n\nFrom my side i will try to play ranked sometimes to have statistics and watch for bug. Played 2 games today w/o issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Porc0ddi0","date":"2014-09-16T17:13:02.222+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"My personal experience with this issue started this summer, at first i thought it was a random misfortune (pun intended), but when i began gettin this regularly i promptly contacted the support to report this problem. Needless to say, before doing that i double checked all the usual things (firewall, IP, router, provider, you know what) and followed the normal routine of restarting the client, then the modem, then the pc...i also had an expert coming to check if i had any issue with the connection: everything was fine. So, the support replies with auto responses, advicing to check firewalls and connection etc (of course i mentioned in my ticket that i ALREADY checked), so i turned to the net, searched this firewall issue and...i discovered that the net was FULL of users with the same issues, and the worst part of it was that i ONLY found users' thread and discussion. Not a word from the developers, despite hundreds of users claiming to have sent tickets just like i did. I tried in every way to contact a real person of the support, wrote on the facebook page of a rioteer, sent emails worldwide...nothing, not a response from a rioteer. EVER. \n\nThere's a forum which is supposed to serve this purposes, ironically called \"Help and support\", containing countless reports about this exact problem, people from all over europe asking for the support they were supposed to find, and NONE of these has ever had a reply from a rioteer. It's like speaking to some ranting child plugging his ears with the hands. From a certain point, people stopped asking for a solution and started asking ONLY for a statement about this thing, even a \"we don't know how to cope with it\" would have been appreciated...we got nothing instead. \n\nThere are people who seriously investigated the thing by their own (since the lack of a support), and discovered that the problem is actually affecting THEIR servers, explaining how packets were actually sent by the user but got no response from the riot server. This would explain also the coincidence of the exact problem between users with different connections, providers, etc...I'm no expert but if you check the forum you'll find the details. It is just sad that USERS had to do this while riot was (is) still answering to check firewalls and look for help in the forum.\n \nNow, after a 7 days ban, i quitted LoL for good. This game was funny once, but now it only twitches (yes, yes) my nerves each time i think of it. The way they managed things is simply unacceptable on their behalf. They're not a small underground company, they have engineers and technicians paid with our money, working relentlessly when it comes to advertise and develop new skins and bundles etc etc, so how is it possible for them to get stuck with a problem like this? Well, it's not. So why they act like this? My best guess is that they don't want to 'scare people' by releasing a public a statement about this...people (like me and many others) would start asking why they didn't do anything in the first place (because we are talking MONTHS here), and how they think to compensate the thousands of users who have lost league points, got banned and reported and so forth...not to speak about users who never had this problem and may take a break from playing ranked or wait to buy that awesome new skin or champ.  Well, i just can't take it. That's the kind of behaviour you would expect from an underground, little shady company which lacks the resources to solve their issues and just tries to keep the money flowing, not from riot...and still, look at what point we are. I keep on following this thing because it's just not fair, i'm still writing the support almost every day in the hope of getting a non automated response, i keep posting on forums and all the rest, NOT because i want to see it fixed so i can go back playing (i'll NEVER play it again), but only to see how they could answer my questions.

We work tirelessly behind the scenes and one-on-one with players to ensure that any and all problems playing are resolved.  However, I wanted to clarify some points you raised.  There have been times in the past couple of weeks and months where our servers experienced stability issues.  Some of these have even been due to DDOS attacks, which we discussed here:\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/server-status\n\nDuring these types of issues, multiple players in game can experience the same disconnection issues.  When we have these widespread server issues, we immediately put up a ticker message in a client and update our [Server Status page](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/?en_US#na).  Recently, there has been no serverwide issues causing players to be unable to connect to games.  Because of this, we would be remiss if we did take a look at the most common reason for connection issues, local networks.  \n\nIf we can consistently rule out that the local network is not the root cause (by reviewing logs/data provided by players through a ticket), this will help us find the root cause of the connection issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Positioning King","date":"2014-09-17T01:56:22.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, I appreciate the response. I was curious so I checked my ticket history and I see this was actually early April. I recall DDOS issues being discussed *among forum users* but, and I cannot stress this enough, there was not a single red post acknowledging the issue at the time and no indication within the client that anything was amiss.\n\nI can't figure out how to get to the old forums so I have no idea how to look anything up, but if you're curious, the aforementioned game was around 9am PST on Saturday, April 5, and I submitted a ticket a couple days later after some more issues, #11292564, and of course was just told that you can't retroactively apply loss-prevention (which I'm totally cool with). But, again, I would have liked the ticket response to include some kind of \"I'm so sorry this happened and we are researching the root cause\" as well. I'm sorry, but when multitudes of people are consistently being dropped from games or unable to connect in the first place, I hope you can sympathize that it is frustrating to be told \"if you are continuing to experience issues, I can help you troubleshoot your connection.\" I cannot fathom a scenario in which three of ten people in a ranked solo queue game fail to connect and the problem is on *my* end.\n\nUm, sorry, I am usually totally onboard with Riot's decisions and I am very self conscious about coming off as a complainer here. So let me close by saying that when I played a ranked game a couple weeks ago and everything was going all wonky, and we lost, and I saw the LOSS PREVENTED screen, I was happy.

This is definitely something that Riot did in their client and/or server code back in client patch 4.15.  I never had issues anywhere remotely close to what I'm having now since that patch.  Every 2 or 3 out of 5 matches that I play I get the disconnect/reconnecting issue.  It first begin with the \"ice skating\" effect with my champion and other champions \"floating\" around the map and then the rubber banding effect and shortly after the famous \"Attempting to Reconnect\" message.  I've done every single thing that Riot has posted in their antiquated 2012/2013 connection issues posts, including but not limited to \"firewall port forwarding\"; IPv6 disabling, Peer-to-Peer disabling; IP Helping service disabling, re-installations/repairs, DNS server changes to the public recommended servers, multiple conversations with my ISP, the list goes on and on.  Its my personal belief that they did something in the network code at either the client or server endpoints which has made the game \"zero\" tolerant to even the slightest packet loss.  If you experience just the packet loss or network interruption the client goes nuts and is unable to recover, but it could also be something that is caching because even after the PC reboots the issue persists and will happen again within 90 seconds of rejoining the match and/or disconnecting during the summoner reloading screen.   Maybe a service or application incompatibility from something that we all share in common or even a process/service that operates at those network layers.  What ever it is the problem seems to be affecting certain players and under certain circumstances, Riot knows about it I'm sure, but just doesn't want to dedicate the time and/or resources into resolving the issue because it probably isn't affecting a majority of their low ELO high revenue consumers.  Also, if there is a known permanent fix, they could be putting it off because of a possible \"significant\" impact on the existing code framework in 4.16 which is probably another reason why they have been ignoring it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OOKAMISHURA","date":"2014-09-16T10:20:36.431+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the exact same problem!

I feel like i've been scammed: i report a problem to the support (thinking that's the reason why a support service is there for) asking to help out the community, and only get auto answers in return. I write again, clarifying the point, suggesting to work around the problem (like WARNING the community or reset the leaverbuster or simply saying \"we're trying to figure it out\"), i send links of discussions where expert users had reported technical details, i even write personally to a rioteer on facebook, because i truly want to get back playing...well, i get nothing. NOTHING! After this i get banned for trying to apply some kind of fix that users (people who ACTUALLY care) shared on the net, and i try to contact the support again (though my previous experience had been so discouraging), this time reporting that i got an unfair ban for an issue that i already pointed and had been ignored. I thought they would have been AT LEAST concerned for a user having SUCH a poor experience with their 'services', even only for aziendal reasons...but nothing, again. Auto responses suggesting me to check the 'help and support' forum (ironically enough, i got this answer to a ticket in which i asked THEM to check the 'help and support' forum...this is real).  \n\nSo, at this point i stopped playing my hard-worked-money-earned account, wondering about how could riot miss the basic point that customer's satifaction and quality services are..sorry, SHOULD BE number one concern for any company, let alone those companies (Riot i.e.) of tremendous success with a huge and steady money flow and an ever growing number of customers. Imagine going to the world's most famous fast food and being served food that you can't eat, let's say a rotten burger...you go to the counter and report the problem. Can you imagine the guy simply IGNORING you? Could something like this keep on happening steadily for moths? Ok it's a little forced maybe, but you get the idea.\n\nNow i hope that players will see this fixed, and hopefully get compensated in some way for what they lost and for having been prevented using something they (in most cases) had paid; hope that riot will spend some of that money figuring out how to give back league points and reset the leave counter of those who suffered this issue; hope they'll get a time machine too, so to give back the time we spent raging for this when all we wanted were just 45 minutes of fun. \n\nAfter all of this, my question will still be: how could riot let this happen?","replies":[]},{"poster":"ArashXX","date":"2014-09-17T15:07:01.654+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right after the new patches, the server keep DCing me at random times and not letting me reconnect to the match.

I have done EVERYTHING both Riot suggestions and online searches and nothing has changed. But what truly truly baffles me is how a company as big as Riot is (thanks to US THE FANS AND PLAYERS) can ignore countless forums, complaints, tickets, e-mails, and the like for so long. I mean at this point it would make Riot seem incompetent to come out and say \"We didn't notice.\" Even if this is only happening to 3% of their customer base worldwide that would still be several thousands of complaints. What is really going on? I get a creeping fear that maybe Riot is in the works with some ISP to fabricate this for a future means of revenue production which may in fact fuck us all over a la Facebook. I really really hope this is not true but one really must wonder \"if this is truly a problem why haven't they responded...unless (to them) it's NOT a problem.\" {{summoner:11}}  bg","replies":[]},{"poster":"f0ib1e","date":"2014-09-16T14:28:50.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"FIXED - if you're in America, the Latin America North serves are working just fine.
