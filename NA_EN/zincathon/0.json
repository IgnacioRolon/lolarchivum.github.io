So what I found was a brawler's glove gives 8% crit dmg on Ashe. With the runes though it'll give 11% crit dmg. So the runes increase the % of the crit chance on the item, to make Ashe's final crit damage. A small oversight on my part X_x My bad! So then the question arises, should the runes affect her final damage or her modified damage. Final damage meaning her passive is calculated and then the runes applied, or her modified damage meaning the runes apply to her passive calculations. With other champions the runes stack with IE and such. Anivia can basic attack a minion for 60, 120(crit no runes), 144~ (runes), 174~ (runes and IE Excluding the 80 AD bonus).

The crit damage runes are covering the difference. If you're arguing the maths again, this solution was not for you. However, Crit Damage runes DO have a difference on your champion in the game, and the exact same difference that it does on anyone else (that is, X% higher crit damage... or exactly 0 effect without any Crit Chance). The only difference on Ashe is that your damage is averaged over its entire chance range, and then propped up a flat 10% for a little boost.\n\nDon't forget, we are talking about the permaslow champion here; she isn't going to be given some random boost from those runes because they decided to smooth out her damage curve. Heck, she has 3 different damage steroids now (well, one Attack speed). Their intention was not to give a 40% damage boost on top of that when it doesn't even work that way on normal champions. Normal champions get only a 20% boost, assuming 100% crit chance (from 200% damage to 240% damage... in terms of percent increase over original, that's 20%).\n\nSo, once again, Crit Damage doesn't effect you without Crit Chance. That is this game. Some people get inherent Crit Chance (Trynda, Shaco), but without that, you'll need to add some early game to see any difference, and that difference *will be multiplicative based on both stats*. If you're missing one of the two, you will most certainly see poorer values in your damage (well, within reason. You start the game with +100% Critical Strike damage, so Crit Chance can pay dividends alone).","replies":[]}]}]}]}
