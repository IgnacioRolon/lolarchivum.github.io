I will share my thoughts to the overall story, art style, characters and world building. And as you can expect, this will contain spoiler,  so don’t read this before you haven’t read the issue! Serious, the comic is by far better than my summary.\n\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/468671979269128194/646754441323872267/Unbenannt2.png\n\n\n_**~~Story~~**_\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/468671979269128194/646787563708874793/Zed.png\n\nAfter a brief introduction about the Ionian War and a map which shows the location the story plays, the comic starts.\nZed, looking at a statue of Master Kusho, his former master, thinks about Kusho and Shen. In his monologue he admits how much he admired Kusho and that he was the person who killed Kusho. Interesting enough, Zed seems to address the reader directly in his thoughts.\n“Why? What makes you think you have the right to know why?”\n\nZed and six more members of the Order of shadow, including Kayn and a new character named Jovn Tau, are supposed to meet with Master Althon, Kusho’s nephew which refuses further militarization of the region. Although, meeting is probably not the right word, they did come with purpose of killing Althon.\n\nAlthon arrives, he attacks Zed and Zed kills him. In this fight we get some interesting information about Zed’s name - it is not his name given by birth. He used to be called Govos and later was renamed by Kusho to Usan.\n\nMeanwhile, Shen investigates why the spirits of the Olgathee forest are furious. Akali arrives, mentioned that Zed is not far away from here and urges him to go and get his revenge. As expect, Shen declines her offer but Akali has set her mind – she will go after Zed no matter if Shen joins her cause or not.\nSwitching back to Zed, he and Kayn are discussing the current finances of their order outside a tavern until they get interrupted by a woman which has a message for Zed. She says a rich man wants to meet him in a place, she gives Zed a scalpel which used to belong to him in his time in the Kinkou Order and leaves.\n\nThe scalpel brings back memories for Zed – he recalls how Shen and he first time found a village slaughtered by the Golden Demon. In the aftermath of this event, Kusho and Zed tried to save as many villagers as they could. Zed, with his heart full of guilt for not being able to save every person and have to leave people to die, was comfort by Kusho. He did well, Kusho said, and then the time would come for Kusho to step down, he would pick Zed as the new Eye of Twilight. He gives Zed the Name Ulan, which is the Ionian world for the strength of compassion.\nBack in the present, Zed and his men follow the invention.  But as Zed already suspected, this would be a trap. In ruins of the village, his acolytes only find two corpses arranged by Khada Jhin. In the last shot we can see Jhin waiting patiently for his guest to arrive.\n\n_**~~Art Style~~**_\n\nThe art style looks similar to the Lux comic while it doesn’t suffer from the same problems – weird faces and the difficulty to follow the movements. The action looks fluid and is easy to follow as reader. I also enjoyed the use of bright colors, especially for Ionia which is so colorful. However, I noticed that most of the Order of the Shadow members are often drawn with muted colors and look really pale, almost sickly. I wonder if it is only to guide the eye to Zed (which is brighter than the rest) or if it has some more meaning behind it.\n\n_**~~Characters~~**_\n\n_***~~Zed~~***_\n\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/468671979269128194/646795843344662534/EJ0HqfwWoAEoElY.png\n\nWhile I still don’t like how Zed looks, I love his character so far in the comic. I’m surprised in which direction he currently is guide to since all other canon material we have makes him incredible aggressive and harsh (maybe aside the Jhin color story). But [Odin](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/765RkwlE-a-quick-recap-about-the-upcoming-zed-comic-what-we-know-and-what-the-can-expect?comment=0007) also said something similar to me a while ago.\n\n> As the comic’s goes forward, Zed’s face and it’s stoic sadness begins to sink into your heart and that comments on, and contrasts with, the raw aggression of his helmet and armor.\n\nOn interesting thing is to see how much he admired his former master Kusho. Odin is right, he is hiding his stoic sadness with raw aggression.\nSo, let’s talk about Zed’s former name. Overall, it seems that Zed used to be a boy of a peasant from a northern provience which was picked up by Kusho. His old name, Grovos, seem to be more like a common name. More interesting to see is how important names seem to be in Ionia. You name has to reflect your personality. Then Kusho renamed Zed to Ulan, it was a honor. The strength of compassion. I wonder – how much is left of this compassionate boy?\n\nAnother interesting thing is that Zed actually was considered as Eye for the Twilight. While I personally always thought Zed was trained for something, I always thought he could maybe have been the Fist of Shadow – the aggressive force of the Kinkou Order. Not the neutral force. Not the leading force of the Kinkou. I really didn’t expect that.\nFurthermore, we also know that Zed has (or had) some healing abilities. While he also can use the scalpel and needle, he also uses magic to heal a villager. I wonder if he is still able to do so.\n_***~~Shen~~***_\n\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/468671979269128194/646788161262977025/Zed2.png\n\nWe haven’t got much insight about him yet. He was doing his duty and we can assume he doesn’t go after Zed for revenge but after Akali to keep her safe. Also, his unmasked face looks great, I love it.\nAlso it seems that Shen, at some point was in love and betrothed to a woman named Yevnai. \n\n_***~~Kayn~~***_\n\nhttps://media.discordapp.net/attachments/468671979269128194/646788604743647244/Zed3.png\n\nFirst of all, finally some canon interaction between Kayn and Zed! Back then I heard that Kayn was supposed to be Zed right hand, I didn’t really believe in it. For that ingame Kayn seem to be too full of himself. Not only that both talk on the same eyelevel, Kayn is a more critical person then I expected. Seeing him like this actually some a breath of fresh air, which I enjoy. And he is still himself, wanted to fight Althon because he warmed up. Running without armor because who needs that? Truly not Kayn.\nAlso, interesting to see how Kayn’s corruption is not the same as ingame. So far only his left underarm is affected while ingame his complete left arm, shoulder and left eye are corrupted. Also he doesn’t have braided hair nor his iconic blue streak. I wonder why he started to braid his hair. Probably Rhaast urged him to do?\n\n_***~~Akali~~***_\n\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/468671979269128194/646788839381401600/Zed4.png\n“Here is a horse, you come with me NOW!” Akali acts like her voiceover. I’m surprise to see that she really thinks she can take six men out to challenge Zed. Shen probably feels like he has to make sure she doesn’t kill herself.\nNice to see she still cares about Shen. But she really is not respectful person.\n\n_***~~Jovn Tau~~***_\n\nhttps://media.discordapp.net/attachments/468671979269128194/646789251849256970/Zed5.png\n\nWe don’t know much about him yet. Seems like more brawls than brain so far, likes to drink and thinks the world owns everything because he fought in the war.  In Zed’s monologue he also calls most of follows “boys” which seems a fitting description of Jovn so far. So, how many issues do we give him before he gets killed of?\n\n_***~~Jhin~~***_\n\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/468671979269128194/646789463254499363/Zed6.png\nAside from the last shot, we haven’t see Jhin yet only his action. Personally, I don’t really believe the “his art is so beautiful and terrifying at the same time” because the pieces we saw so far were not impress at all. Also, does he always turn humans into “flowers”? In the Jhin color story, a villager also saw flower. So far I actually expect more variability and more horror from him. I’m not impressed so far. Let see if I can be proven wrong.\n\n _**~~World Building~~**_\n\nA lot of new words so far we have to get used to it (I miss the glossary from the Ashe Comic.) More Shadow Magic in action. We learned about the importance of names in Ionia and Zed’s former names. We know that the Order of Shadow is intervened with the Navori Brotherhood (we know it before but still). We learned that the Order of Shadow has some rich patrons which support them financially. Zed was supposed to become the Eye of Twilight, Shen was engaged. Some new information to think about.\n\nThe serie just has begun and already hits hard into the feeling. Can’t wait to see how much world building and story progress we get in the next 5 issues!\nNow, I still have some question left.\n  \n _**~~Questions~~**_\n\n1.\tIs Althon actually human? He looks more like Thanos to me than a human being…\n2.\tWho are the patrons which Kayn mention? Can we assume that Zed and his acolytes do mission regularly for money and influence? Kayn’s comment does suggest such a thing.\n3.\tWhat does Yanlei mean?  A pejorative world for follower?\n4.\tSo, Shen was engaged to someone named Yevnai. Did Shen married her? Also, why in the hell would a possible Eye of Twilight marry someone? The Eye is supposed to be neutral, being a husband and father is far from being neutral.\n5.\t“We are not thieves.” Said Zed, while both the Xayah Color Story and Wild Magic does indicate, yes, they are stealing magic and life essence. How can he say such a thing if they are stealing the magic and bound souls to their weapon?\n6.\tWill the ever know which meaning the name Shen and Zed have? We can assume these have some meaning.\n7.\tSpeaking off names with meaning – how often do people name someone like this? We know the word Syndra means destruction, giving into the darkest desires. I always thought the world got that nuance after Syndra was forced in her slumber, now it seems like she actually could have been named destruction by her parents.\n8.\tThe amulet which Kusho gave to Zed, what does it mean?\n9.\tSo is Zed now a mage or not? He probably used healing magic in that one picture, does it mean to command Shadow Magic, do you need to have a connection to the magic?\n10.\tSo there in the hell is Kayn’s blue streak in his hair? Why does ingame Kayn braids his hair? Serious, it seems weird that he misses his blue streak…\n\n\n _**~~The upcoming Issue~~**_\n\n> ### https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/468671979269128194/646791807426101277/EJ0awEZXkAAzTM1.jpg\n(Will be released on the 18th December)\nAnyway, thanks for reading my thread!

(Check out the WB art on universe!)\n\n2. Hmmmm indeed!\n\n3. Yanléi is the actual name of Zed’s order.  It means “The Tears” as in the Shadow’s Tears. Also known as \"The Tear's of the Shadow.\"  \nThe shadow’s tears are a magical ichor which gives Zed and his followers the ability to use shadow magic— (when tattooed or ingested) \nWe will be learning more about this.\n\n4. Hmmmm.  Yes...Hmmmm.  This feels like an important detail.\n\n5. They don’t see this as the same thing. But honestly you ( and Xayah!) are right. It is theft of a resource but he doesn’t see it that way.\n\n6. Actually their names already have meanings in a couple of our earth languages.   I didn’t work on these champs— but I assume \nwhen they designed them, the team intended the names to reflect the meanings already associated with those words:  \nZed means \"Holy Justice\" or \"God’s Justice.\"   Zed also is a stand in for Zero, 0, or naught.    (An interesting contrast  IMO)\nShen I believe means spirit, holy, or deity. \n\n7. Most  (not all) names have meaning.  On Ionian and on earth.  Aphelios literally means \"furthest from the sun.\" \n\n8. Yes… another good question… .  (To quote Bug's Bunny \"Ain't, I a stinker.\")\n\n9. A lot of characters can do magic in Runeterra.  A mage is someone that specializes in just magic.  \nShadow magic will be explored a bit more in the comic.\n\n10. Basically relates to using the scythe.  Will see a bit more on this much later in the series.","replies":[{"poster":"MamaCarrotCake","date":"2019-11-22T19:57:29.930+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I may make a guess on number 4?\n\nI’m going to guess she is dead either from Jhin or Zed.

I would guess this with Shens fathers harsh treatment towards his son has led to Shen being so cold, almost afraid to really feel again.\n\nThough I admit I have some bias as I like Akali and Shen as a duo so take what I say with a grain of salt. Overall an amazing comic so far.\n\nAlso Kusho is Shens father and Shens marriage was arranged so I imagine The Eye can have a family, just be rather cold to them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lady Faceless","date":"2019-11-22T15:55:56.073+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, thank you so much for the answers!

Back then I heard that Kayn was supposed to be Zed right hand, I didn’t really believe in it. For that ingame Kayn seem to be too full of himself. Not only that both talk on the same eyelevel, Kayn is a more critical person then I expected. Seeing him like this actually some a breath of fresh air, which I enjoy. And he is still himself, wanted to fight Althon because he warmed up. Running without armor because who needs that? Truly not Kayn.\n> Also, interesting to see how Kayn’s corruption is not the same as ingame. So far only his left underarm is affected while ingame his complete left arm, shoulder and left eye are corrupted. Also he doesn’t have braided hair nor his iconic blue streak. I wonder why he started to braid his hair. Probably Rhaast urged him to do?\n> \n\n\n\nYes, absolutely. I was surprised to see the marked difference between his in-game personality and what the comic reveals. \n\nThough this is perhaps (just like in the Odyssey short story), made to reflect the changes in the character. Just like his physical design (less corruption, no blue streak, both human eyes, etc), it is meant to show the 'before' and 'after'. We can also notice the lack of Rhaast's voice. He's quiet, sleeping, hidden in the cloth, he -isn't really there yet-. \n\n \nWe can easily infer this comic is set in a previous timeframe to the 'present Kayn'.\n\n Then, we have his speech, which surprised me the most; filled with contractions, makes him feel 'younger'.\n\nI really liked his strategical concern for money, always searching how to 'get funds' for the Order's campaign. He's truly Zed's Right Hand.\n\n\nI'm eager to see the next issue, Jhin as a disruptive element will affect the characters and feed us more details on their personality. \n\nPD: I so want to see the relationship between Kayn and Jovn!","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2019-11-21T22:14:05.302+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah as the series goes on, we will see a lot more of Kayn and how his relationship works with Zed.

I like it when Riot dips into more mature and darker themes. They make you really question how things would have turned in other scenarios because their personality is full of nuance. In Kegan's case, I felt that if he met someone more therapeutic than Ryze, he would be better off. \n\n> A good act doesn't nullify a bad one. Yes, Zed fights for Ionia and picked a lot of war ophans, but he also is ready to steal the magic of the land to killing the vastayan in the progress.\n\nI didn't say that everything Zed does is heroic. There is grim practicality behind his decisions. If he doesn't use the magic of the land, then Noxians certainly would because if there is something Noxus can use, Noxus will use it. He doesn't seem to have faith in the First Lands defending themselves just like the balance intended. So he is guided with the belief that the ultimate villains and ultimate victors are only defined by the who's on the winning side. It's more of a tale of turning into the very enemy he fought for. It's dark, brutal and definitely not fair. Yet, this is more satisfying by other Ionian reboots (at least for me)\n\n>Only because Zed is not the classical villain (he is more of an anti-villain) doesn't make his action right.\n\nI didn't say it was right. But it's quite interesting to explore. Zed's bio got a lot more ambiguous as time went by. He practices a very militaristic approach against all foreigners and took Kayn in as a way to mock Noxians by killing them with their own \"weapon\". From that perspective, Kayn is more like his revenge project, someone who Zed would train to do everything for his praise - but won't really care about. \n\nHowever, in the comic Kayn is not shown as being fearful of Zed like a harshly trained assassin would be fearful of his cold and superior master. In fact, he openly asks Zed about his decisions and is the one to remind him about the financial issues. Kayn does all of that in a calm, almost relaxed way, which shows that they share mutual trust. \n\nAlso, while Zed calls Shen's path weak and criticizes his father, it's funny how Kayn, who wasn't trained by Shen, never has anything bad to say about Shen. It's respect and even regret (which is NOT typical for Kayn when it comes to killing others). Even Akali treats Shen worse.  Since Zed affects Kayn a lot, we can assume that somebody has never said a bad thing about Shen in Kayn's presence. \n\nAlso the comic implies that there are two sides to Zed. He is still saddened and bitter by how the things turned out - and he preferred to face Althon himself because he felt it was the right way to do so. However, when the mask is on, he is that cold assassin that knows no mercy and kills without hesitation. As if that's what he made himself to be because he knows there is no other way.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"IlyaK1986","date":"2019-11-20T22:36:46.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Comic was decent, only a little action, and the order's motives aren't exactly clear.

I prefer League's typical art style, but the Lux comic looked good, even if it had some weird expressions sometimes (mainly on Sylas in particular, for whatever reason). Zed comic looks ugly, way too much like a Silver age comic and not in a nostalgic homage way. There's even a point where Master Althon is talking a crap ton in two panels, yet those panels clearly show action that lasts like one second. Such a Silver age thing to do. \n\n> Personally, I don’t really believe the “his art is so beautiful and terrifying at the same time” because the pieces we saw so far were not impress at all.\n\nWe didn't really get to see Jhin's victims, they were obscured. I honestly think that's for the best because it leaves it up to the imagination rather than to try and actually illustrate something that is both beautiful and horrifying. Anything they tried to make would have to be PG13, so wouldn't be anywhere near as horrific as its meant to be. \n\n> Also, does he always turn humans into “flowers”? In the Jhin color story, a villager also saw flower. So far I actually expect more variability and more horror from him. I’m not impressed so far. Let see if I can be proven wrong.\n\nI'm not really sure how you can judge Jhin's presentation seeing as he was barely in the comic at all. It was all setup. The reason Jhin's work is so awful is because his victim's FACES look like the flowers. Just try to imagine, what does one have to do to a human face to make it look like a flower? These people are mangled. Its also kind of Jhin's thing, and serial killers typically have a specific \"calling card\" of sorts. Jhin does every killing really artsy and likes an audience.\n\nAlso, in-game, anyone Jhin kills does one of his trap explosions, which are flowers, so its kind of nice nod to his gameplay (or the passive is a nice nod to the canon story, not sure which came first). \n\nI overall enjoyed the story as well. I was happy when I realized Kayn would probably be in this, and he is great so far, so I am particularly happy about that. Not really trying to be overly critical of your opinions. These few things you mentioned just bothered me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2019-11-20T18:52:22.632+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, the artstyle is a little weak for me.
