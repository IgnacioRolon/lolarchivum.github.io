It seems to me a dull and boring character motivation, but the deeper problem is that Riot felt the need to explain his motivation at all.  Riot's writers seem to think they have to humanise every character, no matter how inhuman, just to get people to like them. It's an insult to intelligence. I prefer beings like Nautilus to be more than human - unfathomable in their goals. Far too many of League's backstories are now:\n\n\"X was once an ordinary man, who loved to do Y. One day, unfortunate incident Z happened to him, and he was transformed into the inhuman creature known as N\" (who is basically just an ordinary human with normal human motivations who looks a bit weird and has supernatural powers.)\n\nSeriously, Riot, try to create some genuinely non-human characters. Don't try to humanise them, don't try to explain them, just describe their mysteries in a compelling way.

Also the Narrative discipline shouldn't be afraid to attempt exploring new grounds on old lore, there is plenty of interesting opportunities to fulfill a character with new perspectives.

Nautilus has almost always been devoid of most emotions other than revenge, which is why when his revenge failed he was just aimlessly wandering the oceans. It added to his inhumanity, it made him seem like the mystery that consumed him may be trying to emulate his human nature, but not being good at grasping onto emotions, so it defaults to indifference.

It&#x27;s a written work- you are *meant* to fill in the gaps with your own imagination. That&#x27;s the *point* of the medium.\n\nFirst of all, you're missing my points. I was asking _how does he make ships pay the tithe before sinking them?_ He comes across as an evil asshole if he's just willy nilly sinking ships who are either unaware of an ancient tithe paying practice, or even if they don't pay a tithe when he's immediately beneath them. How is a ship supposed to know when to properly pay a tithe? \nAlso, he's not \"making a ship\" pay the tithe by sinking them, that's counter-productive to the argument I was making. Nautilus supposedly wants ships to pay a tithe or he sinks them. He's got physically no way to request the tithe from them, so his only option is to sink them. It'd be like a toll booth with a road that goes around it sending you a fine for $100 because you didn't pay the toll.\nAnd in regards to this potential \"magical ability to detect if people have paid a tithe,\" come on now. Did you listen to yourself or even read ANY of Nautilus' lore? He was presumably consumed by something unknown and eldritch in the oceans. The only thing he remembers is that his old captain didn't pay a tithe before sending him to inky waters, so assuming that he's got some magic ability to detect when people are being cheapskates is ridiculous, even for fantasy writing standards. We don't have any reason to believe that whatever eldritch thing he is now has any magical powers related to money, nor do we have any indication that magic is even remotely associated with protections for the tithe paying. The only thing we know is that the tithe paying is a superstition that Nautilus remembers, and he associates the payment of the tithe with not being consumed by the waters. There are gaps to fill in, yes, but that would imply there's a lot of magic at work that we haven't even seen or gotten hints of. All we know is that something consumed him, and that's it. We don't know it's nature, and we don't get an impression of crazy magics around it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Doctor Dyment","date":"2018-05-29T22:26:06.246+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would be lying if I said I am not disappointed that Nautilus is no longer a monstrous thing on the hunt for revenge, but I suppose with Pyke's story and many others it would have been far too similar to keep intact.

I like that, and I like it a lot. A few questions if anyone on the lore team is reading this:\n1. Is Nautilus still attempting to keep an eye out for his former captain, if he ever did see him again?\n2. Is the lore about Nautilus holding off the a part of the Harrowing all by himself still canon, and if so does this imply that deep down Nautilus still has the compassion of a human, however buried it may be? (This is the one I am most interested in)\n3. Does Nautilus even vaguely know of the affairs of Bilgewater? Does he even remember Bilgewater at all? If he does in any respect, what do you think his feelings regarding our current cast of characters would be? Theoretically of course.\nThe lore team has done a fine job with my favorite champion in the League so far, and I look forward to what they do in the future with him.","replies":[{"poster":"SooFr0sty","date":"2018-05-29T22:47:13.411+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope they keep the harrowing part canon, it is by far my favorite piece of lore in League of Legends.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GenoXx","date":"2018-05-29T22:24:32.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"RIP Narrative...

However, it misses one big thing, and arguably his most defining feature: His anchor.\n\nThe whole point of the anchor in his old lore was that it was his only clue and hope towards finding those who betrayed him, and instead of putting his anchor down and leaving his grudge behind him he carried it with him. This story doesn't really even touch on that, and it almost comes as a surprise that he still has the anchor at the end, since it barely talked about him carrying it before. Instead of talking about the most important part about the champion, it keeps talking about the tithe thing for some reason. It would be like if Braum's lore barely talked about his door-shield and then randomly mentions at the end that he uses a door as a weapon.\n\n\nOther than that, I like what they did with the new Nautilus, and the idea of him working with a salvage crew, as well as the fact that he normally freedived instead of being clad in armor. That aspect is definitely better than the researcher for the League thing he had in his old lore.","replies":[{"poster":"KuroCaliber","date":"2018-05-29T23:08:52.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, his anchor was mentioned: \"Nautilus grabbed the anchor chain, his last connection to the world above, and hauled himself up even as the thing below sought to drag him down. But the weight was too much. Just as his giant metal fingers were about to breach the surface, the chain snapped. Nautilus screamed within the suit, but none could hear him. He tumbled back into the inky maelstrom, clutching the sinking anchor in desperation. Dark tendrils enveloped him, and he could only watch as the dimming outline of his ship faded away. Then everything went black.\"  So it's still a memento from his betrayal and something that sunk into the darkness with him!","replies":[{"poster":"CleverCactus","date":"2018-05-29T23:32:14.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, it mentions the anchor, but it doesn't talk about why he continues to carry it.

Old Naut lore still had it so that finding his old crew was possible, but new Naut lore had him under for so long the crew and captain had disappeared.  Also it mentions 'his' anchor at the end, not 'an' anchor, meaning most likely it is the one that fell with him.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
