Looks pretty similar, the whole atmosphere, the ground, the magic energy in the air. And you can see an old castle in the background. Even some mist. That's why I think Shadow Isles is most likely.\n\nResolve:\nThe mountainous terrain is actually a pretty fitting description for Freljord.\nAnother picture of LoL universe of this area.\nhttp://universe-meeps.leagueoflegends.com/v1/assets/images/factions/image-gallery/freljord-rakelstake.jpg\nAgain, looks similar. Mountains, pine trees and no zivilisation. And the design of the rune itself says Freljordian more than Targonian.\n\nInspiration:\nThe runes in the middle of the gyroscope show stars, a common motive for targon.\nIt is on the top of a mountain, not at the down end of it like the Resolve tree. More fitting for Mount Targon, since the whole theme is \"closer to the stars\". And the circular motives of the gyroscope are common for Targonian designs as well.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sparkle","date":"2017-09-26T17:29:25.405+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"You guyyyysss. <3 \n\nI just sent this to the art team (so many people helped us with these!!) and they're so happy that you all are happy.","replies":[{"poster":"Raven Redeemed","date":"2017-09-26T21:51:38.199+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They look amazing!\n\nQuestion: will there be any animation to these in the client?
