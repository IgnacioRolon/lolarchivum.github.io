I can get some of the phrases simply because they are really obvious, but a lot of it is just unintelligible noise to me.  The voice filter is just so harsh, Kogmaw is easier to understand than him.\n\nChampion voices are such a big part of why people like playing champions: For example I could never play a ton of Zoe simply because I really dislike her voice, regardless of the rest of her kit/lore.  You can see it in all sorts of dubbed shows, when voice actors change there is a ton of dissatisfaction among the audience.  With that in mind I really think that the designers steer really far away from the original sound of his voice (which was one of the nicest VO to listen to in League simply because the actual voice itself was so well done, regardless of the actual content) without actually providing anything better.\n\nI can understand going more Monstrous/Aggressive to fit with the war theme, but the previous Aatroxx's voice was already a really good embodiment of war, while also being easily understandable.  I guess it all boils down to the question of: Why would I want to listen to Aatrox talking now?  I have to spend more time trying to understand what he is saying than playing the game.  Champion voices should cut through the context of the game to deliver lines that get you in the mood, not draw you out of it trying to understand what they are saying.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leverette","date":"2018-06-12T19:41:35.092+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WAAARGHbobo,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=8ipQEKvE,comment-id=00090002,timestamp=2018-06-12T16:34:03.699+0000)\n>\n> Remminder, you’re listening to just the “highlight reel” of Aatrox murdering people— not the full VO experience we mapped for walking from fountain, lanning, team fight, late game, challenging people, etc... etc..\n> \n> {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}\n\n**I wish to respectfully and maturely discuss a point of view I believe to be very important, which I know many also feel.  This is said out of love, not spite or anger.  It would honor me if you would receive this viewpoint.  Disagree if you like, and I will accept that.  Just so long as we know this viewpoint is understood, it will set many at ease.**\n\nFirst off, yes, this new interpretation looks pretty cool.  I think it's clear many agree on that.  He's definitely cool and we definitely want him.  But lets talk about current Aatrox.\n\nCurrent Aatrox is a stoic, calm, poetic being that ignites passion within the soul without having to scream and shout.  He is truly a war demon.  I know that a shouting angry man may seem like a better candidate for that role, but hear me out:\n\nOne of the most iconic aspects of a demon is that they try to get humans to commit sin.  Humans relish personal glory, but demons are a different breed and they tend to thrive on creating sin.  We don't know why they like it, but they like it and it's interesting.  Current Aatrox accomplishes this better than most any other demon character in fiction I know of.  He is calm and quiet so that he doesn't put you off.  Obviously you wouldn't even be willing to hear out someone who is clearly, bombastically evil and even admits it outright by saying things like \"I am the world ender!\"  Current Aatrox is smarter and more effective than the other demons of fiction.  Rather than saying something insulting about humanity, he instead calmly reminds you that _you already know_ your kind is deranged, and he manages it in subtle ways that make you think it's your own ideas.  Let me give some examples:\n\n\"Peace is the greatest lie of all.\"\n'How many years of true peace has the world had?  Yeah, that's what I thought.'  That's basically what Aatrox is saying here, and you just can't argue against that.  Yet he isn't forcing the idea upon you in a way that makes you want to resist.  Rather, he simply states an indisputable fact that you can't really disagree with, which softens you up to the rest of his perspectives and makes you more receptive to what he's trying to tempt you into.  He makes sin sound so reasonable.  After all, if it is ultimately inescapable, why not participate and create a just world with your own hands to ensure it is done properly?\n\n\"They will greet you as heroes.\"\nHe's reminding you of something you already know: Even your own people agree with him.  Nothing is bad about what you're doing.  Everyone else also agrees.  It's okay.  Be their hero and save them.  Go. To. War.\n\n\"Honor will not save them.\"\nHere Aatrox plays with our human condition, convincing us that having ideals and morals like honor will only amount to death and suffering if it prevents us from swinging our blade at a threat... and what is _moral_ about willingly allowing your loved ones to perish?  Instead he emphasizes other good morals like courage and valor, uplifting these human notions as positive and making you see his perspective (war) as heroism rather than cruelty.  Death comes, but you can be _moral_ and save all of your people.  All you have to do is fight back.  It sounds so good when you put it that way, doesn't it?  That's because Aatrox is the perfect war demon.\n\n\nThis new Aatrox seems to completely abandon that personality.  I respect that we haven't heard all of his dialogue, but please also consider that in no way is \"I am the world ender!\" ever a convincing way to get people to trust you and willingly forget that you're evil.  Nothing else he says can wipe away the stain of his clear malevolence, which is also easily reflected in his arrogant, angry tone and mannerisms, which are all very clearly meant to create feelings of despair, inferiority and pitifulness in your pathetic human kind.  He is very, very obviously evil, and is an absolute failure at his original objective.  I know that sounds disrespectful to the hard work that went into making this character, but let me ask you: Would you trust this new Aatrox?  Certainly not.  You clearly feel his malevolence radiating from him.  He may be able to kill many by himself, but gone is his ability to lead people into sin, for he is so very obviously not to be trusted.\n\nI'm not saying he isn't cool and that we don't want him!  But!  Considering he plays nothing like old Aatrox and has nothing like old Aatrox's personality, but is ultimately still fun and interesting, I just think you should've made this character a new, third Darkin.  He IS cool, we all agree on that.  But none of the people who know Aatrox currently would agree that this is the same being.  Instead, that beautifully artistic character is gone forever, and it feels like we're just pretending that isn't the case because this new cool screaming demon man is awesome.  He is!  But he is not Aatrox.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sinistra","date":"2018-06-12T19:25:06.276+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"I hope at least the poor chimpanze got paid well enough for the motion capture you did with him for the aatrox movement animations.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darkone7001","date":"2018-06-12T18:47:42.482+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bro yall need to fix that voice, like, make it more clear to understand that sounds so garbled.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ElectroScalar","date":"2018-06-12T21:55:09.108+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"I said this many times, and I'll say it again. Drastic changes to champions' personalities will always be met with a very strongly split playerbase. This just creates problems.

Old Aatrox was envisioned as an elegant, sinewy left-handed swordsman, turning the tides of war, always helping the losing side, encouraging more bloodshed. Prolonging war, essentially. New Aatrox is a hulking brute. I am still heartbroken from the change to Viktor's lore.
