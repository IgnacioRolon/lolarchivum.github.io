Upon opening the rune page section, I was revealed a secret message that alarmed me.  It stated my account had been comprimised and that I should change my password. Then shortly after, my account was then accessed from elsewhere. I changed the password to something basic because I was going to run a virus scan, and then make a new email, and password. I attempt to log in, and im confronted by a popup that says my account is being transferred to a new region. I am unaware of the region, and working on changing everything now, has anyone else encountered this?     http://prnt.sc/ck5vnu  &lt;----- lightshot of the changed runepages     \nhttp://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=jazzalicious &lt;--- opgg if link is suspicious\n\n\nUPDATE\n---------------\n\nSo now I am no longer able to log in, in order to add to my support ticket. Ontop of that, it says I have made a 20$ RP purchase. Through my email I have been notified of where I have been accessed from. Should I create a new support ticket?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-20T16:29:32.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rest easy, we have an account team that can restore things to order and get you back in game!
