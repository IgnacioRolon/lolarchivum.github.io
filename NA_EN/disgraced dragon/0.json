It charged me the full amount again but on my recent purchases it says it charged me the discounted price. This bug seems to occur when you click on the skin that&#039;s discounted in order to view it and then buying it.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-18T18:45:10.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey BigButtStrongMan -\n\nTo clarify here, is this a visual bug, or are you being charged the full price, as opposed to the discounted one?","replies":[]}]}
