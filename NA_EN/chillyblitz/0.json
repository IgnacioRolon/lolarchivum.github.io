It seems like that SFX/VFX could be problematic since it's such a stark contrast that it could make a difference even outside of high-level play (where they're already occasionally selective about what skins provide competitive disadvantages)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-04-12T17:48:16.629+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi!

The other yi skins have a very clear color change when his E is active whereas this skin's is much less impactful.\n- The sounds when using his Q don't sound impactful enough. It sounds more like metal is hitting metal when it should sound epic as if Master yi is creating a constellation. Perhaps the sound should increase in pitch after every hit to signify that Master yi has jumped to the next target (slightly).\n- The sounds for this skin's W is horribly similar to sounds bard would make. There should be a bigger difference or more distinction to set this skin apart in this regard unless this is what you're going for of course which is fine.\n- When comparing these colors with Cosmic Raver Kassadin's, you can clearly see some differences even though the colors should be more consistent across the cosmic skins.\n- On the \"cape\" for this skin, the cosmic elements should be more noticeable. Cosmic Reaver Kassadin's cape has this effect much more pronounce.\n- When getting a kill in \"ultimate form\" the blue color indicating that you got a kill is kinda lost within the ultimate's blur.\n- Master Yi's ultimate sounds too much like Sion's ult sound.\n\nPositives\n- The animations are near perfect. I love the W, Q and R animations as well as the hit splashes\n- I love the extra attention to detail regarding the voice changes.\n- The recall animation is pretty awesome although it's lacking the constellations in the background like Cosmic Raver Kass.\n- The overall build/artwork of the skin is nice and isn't too chaotic. (There may be an excess of holes on this skin though. Cosmic Reaver Kassadin only has one I believe on the chest whereas this skin has a lot more but that's more of a design decision).\n- The color choices regarding the clothes is excellent along with the star for an eye.\n- I hope the sound for Master Yi's ultimate is global (everyone in the game can hear it if they're close enough).\n\n\nOverall, I think it's a great skin but it has more potential than this. I keep bringing up Cosmic Reaver Kassadin because I believe the inspiration for this skin should be taken from that one. I mean just look at this skin.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1m8-_sxYc0\nIt's so much more high quality than Cosmic Blade Master Yi's is atm and is the same price 1350RP. It doesn't really feel fully like a Cosmic master Yi in it's current state. I know it's only a teaser but I hope they greatly improve this skin for release.\n\n\nThanks for taking our feedback! I hope mine helped as well!","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChillyBlitz","date":"2017-04-12T07:13:51.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cheers man :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gaptain4","date":"2017-04-09T08:48:19.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello there am also a yi main :) I just wanted to share my thoughts about this skin\nThe quality of the skin is too good and the particles are awesome but there are some issues with Q (Alpha Strike)\nThe particles are too slow..W has a sound like bard..E is looking great but when u ult and do an AA master yi comes out of his rage and his head out as i have noticed this.....Idk if this is a bug i wanted to share it..\nWaiting eagerly for this skin :D{{champion:11}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Skelenth","date":"2017-04-06T20:59:18.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Am I the only one who finds the swords crossguard extremely ugly?","replies":[{"poster":"ChillyBlitz","date":"2017-04-06T21:53:51.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Skelenth,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=MqLzrgO1,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-04-06T20:59:18.185+0000)\n>\n> Am I the only one who finds the swords crossguard extremely ugly?\n\nyeah it looks pretty unappealing, will take some time to get used to for sure","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DragonRider007","date":"2017-04-23T06:11:34.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So why isn't this skin out yet?
