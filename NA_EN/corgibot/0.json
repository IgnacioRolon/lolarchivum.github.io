It's become a rather regular problem that has gotten on all of our nerves given that they did not experience this issue on the old client. It seems unfair to have to wait 5 to 15 minutes because of something beyond their control, if there is a fix I would really appreciate knowing about it so I can relay that information to them.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-27T21:34:39.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have your friends try running the new **low-spec mode** in the client options. It will reduce some of those flashy animations on champion select and should be able to let them get their bans and picks in quicker!","replies":[]}]}
