I have nothing running but league and pandora, but its happening probably every other minute where i click and my champion is just stuck doing whatever he was doing, and i can see maybe like the health bar going down or the game like studdering trying to make my champion move and then a few seconds later I get \"attempting to re-connect\" and it connects a few secs later. I've tried some fixes can't say which ones offhand and tried the internet troubleshooter on league's site. Just give me any ideas that might help please I didn't have this lag before.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-21T17:48:51.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your symptoms definitely sound like those commonly reported with packet loss and high packet buffering problems.
