I am currently gold 2 and in my last game I had a silver 2 top laner, who decided he wanted to intentionally feed about 5 minutes in. This isn't the first game this season either. I constantly get low silvers in my games and it makes no sense. Even more frustrating that I know this person wont get banned even after saying he was intentionally feeding in chat.","replies":[]}
