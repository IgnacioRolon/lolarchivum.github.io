In recent times i have been experiencing constant game crashes and i still can&#039;t find out the reason why. there doesn&#039;t seem to be any trigger but it happens very often, like every other game. A new problem that has also raised is that whenever i play ranked and only ranked i can&#039;t connect to the server, which it prompts me to try and reconnect which it doesn&#039;t. And when i proceed to close down the new tab to the game, the main league tab doesn&#039;t say reconnect to the game and yet it says showing game stats which is the end screen after you finished a game, this is however not completed and just goes to the main page in the league client saying that my status is online even though i am registered in a game. Due to this i have received many leaver busters even though none of these problems is my doing. Another problem that i have been been facing is that whenever i try to open league it gives a message stating that this application cannot be opened and i only opens when i spam the application to open. when it does it always says that it has recovered a recent patch and needs to update which takes another 20 min every time that i want to even open  the application.\r\n\r\nThis post has been put up as i am looking for a solution to the multiple problems that i am facing and i am just sick of waiting 20 min due to leaver buster every time i want to play and i am just tired of my game crashing and ruining the game for 9 other players in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"ViciousSummoner","date":"2018-04-05T00:23:16.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Initiate full repair on client through options.\n\nEnable low spec mode.\n\nEnable close client when launching game.\n\nIf you ever fail to load in, just simply force quit the current client through the Activity Monitor app. In doing so you can completely stop all processes running League. If you manually close the client it takes a while for all processes running League to stop. After doing so open a new client and try to reconnect from there. It's always safest to just force quit your client because it can possibly lock you out indefinitely with the bug of returning you to the home page, refusing to reconnect, or simply won't show the reconnect button.\n\nThere is also a crash where you will fail to load into the game and it will prompt you to either cancel or reconnect. If you are playing in full screen never hit the reconnect option. In doing so you end up locking yourself indefinitely in the blank loading screen. There is no way out except with a force shutdown.\n\nThe Mac client suffers a lot more problems because it seems as though not many people use a Mac or some just simply don't report their issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Virtuøsø","date":"2018-04-05T11:27:44.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thx for all the help but do you know any method to stop the game from opening a previous patch, there is a need to update overtime i open league and depending n the recent patch, it can take around 10-20 min","replies":[{"poster":"ViciousSummoner","date":"2018-04-06T00:49:59.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think I've had that happen to me or maybe I'm just not remembering correctly.
