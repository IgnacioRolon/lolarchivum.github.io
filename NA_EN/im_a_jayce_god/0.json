Thus once the door is finally closed on the legacy client it's full steam ahead on giving the new client full focus.\nIn short making a new client is hard, and getting it running alongside the old client at the same time just means more work for everyone.\nI don't look forward to using the new client myself (I've only used it a few times for arams and each time I never knew who I had going into a match until the loading screen), but I think we should hold off on verdicts for a while. If it took them a year to get this far, then I say give them till the end of 2017 and see how well this new ship is sailing. And if you REALLLLY don't like the new client, then sadly you have 2 options. Deal with it or just not play league until things are cleared.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2017-04-16T13:16:16.580+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"They haven't updated anything after that in the Legacy client.

You realize in case they release a patch that changes in-game client (map and playing), they do very little work on out-game client (interface for account and starting game). So releasing a patch altering in-game client shouldn't take much time or effort on out-game.\n\nUnless their code is really that bad, which wouldn't surprise me, most things affecting out-game client can be added as simple new files and simple new keywords and the rest should be handled by the core. Adding new skin into line of skins doesn't mean you actually create a brand new code, unless you fucked something up. Usually it needs to add new keyword into register and even some of that work may be done server-side.\n\nAs for RGM, most of the things yet again are parts of code already implemented, needing very little work plus most of the modes are already done and they are just being enabled and disabled. It really shouldn't take any work (yet again, unless they screwed up) to enable/disable access to certain queue and yet again, it can be done server-side, even needing no patch what so ever.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2017-04-18T15:23:13.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The new client has only been in beta for 5 months, not a full year.
