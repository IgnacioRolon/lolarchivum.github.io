Remember that we always need to remain respectful of others and their opinions even if they disagree with us.&quot;\r\n\r\nYour notice of insults and inflammatory comments seems notably restricted.  If someone uses profanity in any way to me it is an insult. If I write a thoughtful thread and someone answers it in lowercase letters in monosyllables that is also an insult. It is a dishonour for a thirteen year old child to go up to two intelligent adults speaking to each other and contradict one of them words far beneath their level of discourse.  Your rules are childish and hopelessly naive. Why do you allow profanity on these message boards? That is far more of an eyesore than the words peasant and imbecile, which you erased. How old are you? What is your religion and moral integrity?  There are some great inconsistencies in what you advocate. A man that enforces &quot;respect&quot; and at the same time suffers people to use the worst profanity does not know goodness or morality. It is notably inconsistent and makes you seem to be a silver-tongued bully than anyone of any substantial morality. Don&#039;t speak to me of propriety. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&quot;I&#039;m going to apply a lock to this thread since it technically doesn&#039;t belong in Gameplay either.

The intent of all the comments in the linked thread, and even here, was never to discuss with other people, but mainly to insult them for daring to disagree. That’s why I said it seemed almost trolling, there was no discussing, only insulting and deflecting. If someone posts a thread, and you and others comment expecting something to discuss, and just get insulted and told to leave, what would you think should be done about the thread?\n\nRegardless, the intent of the comments was to insult those who responded, at which point they were taken care of. If someone did similar with foul language, they would have the same treatment. Key response is to report those incidents for the mods to look over, and when they get to it (because I am sure they get a fair number of reports), if it’s true, they’ll take action much like they did with the linked thread.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gravesinger","date":"2019-01-03T00:44:29.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Read through the comments in this thread.\n\nThe level of egoism and condescension is _astounding._","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dr Dog","date":"2019-01-03T15:31:26.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im surprised you didnt catch a ban honestly, jikker is my favorite mod on here and by far one of the most fair and more laid back mods, if you got someone like periscope or most any other mod im sure you would have gotten a 24 hour ban","replies":[]},{"poster":"mtothe6thpower","date":"2019-01-03T07:32:02.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=B1GTYMER,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=YyNdTKwB,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-01-02T20:02:43.541+0000)\n> \n> Your notice of insults and inflammatory comments seems notably restricted.
