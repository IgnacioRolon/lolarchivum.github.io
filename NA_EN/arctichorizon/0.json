I just dont understand how this can have happened, especially in ranked as it has the legacy HUD as of now.","replies":[{"poster":"Slyfoxkan","date":"2015-07-23T20:54:38.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ranked is fine. its  the heads up display thats probably crashing everything and the shop is helping. i can play ranked games no problem","replies":[{"poster":"Kreemy","date":"2015-07-23T21:12:26.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Slyfoxkan,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=W0nuMXl4,comment-id=000100010000,timestamp=2015-07-23T20:54:38.634+0000)\n>\n> Ranked is fine. its  the heads up display thats probably crashing everything and the shop is helping. i can play ranked games no problem\n\nThere must be some other issues with my client then, I have repaired it through the launch screen but it didn't help.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Balthichou","date":"2015-07-23T17:50:31.454+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad to see you guys are working on it.
