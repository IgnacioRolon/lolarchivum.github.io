We can get a more in-depth traceroute through [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/).  Download that and run a route to 104.160.131.1.  In general, bad hardware or an unstable connection can certainly cause some trouble so you're likely to see that well before you start hopping around through a traceroute.  For this reason, your best bet would be to use our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot any local problems that might cause you issues with our game servers.
