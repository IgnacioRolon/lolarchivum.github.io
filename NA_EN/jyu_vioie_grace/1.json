In most of my games i have around 300-400 ping, and in a lot of games I have 1000 to 4000 \r\n\r\nping. I even had around 7 or 8 games where im over 10000 or 20000 ping. I only have ping under 100 in some games. It makes it \r\n\r\nreally hard to play the game. Does anyone have any ways of stopping lag? It would really help me. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-28T21:34:59.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Graphics settings definitely won't have any affect on your connection to the server. Huge inconsistencies in your latency (ping) to the server are generally caused by issues along your route to the server, either by pathing changes by the ISP or local network settings. The guide that *Rineyy* linked is a good place to start in order to resolve this. \n\nIf you still see issues with your latency after following those steps, please reach back out to me about this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2016-07-28T08:16:11.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Troubleshoot your connectivity issues.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/su16_keyart_1920x1080_0.jpg?itok=6nj8mHjj","replies":[]}]}
