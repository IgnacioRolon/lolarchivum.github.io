I try to log in and it says my account is suspended for 2 days, doesnt show any chatlogs or anything, and when i checked my email, ALL it says is i have been suspended for &quot;violating the rules&quot; with no explanation as to what.\r\nSo i put in a support ticket to riot asking what exactly i did that was deserving of a ban? because i really dont have a clue why i would be. Its been 2 days, with no answer from riot, and they also changed the ban from a 2 day to a 2 week, with stll no information as to why.\r\nWhat is going on?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-10-23T02:21:15.407+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chances are it had nothing to do with you crashing, unless you have been constantly disconnecting/leaving.","replies":[]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-10-23T01:36:03.366+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"well sometimes it takes a few days to get  response ... i mean they have to go through all the other support tickets get to yours go back and research and review the data that relates to you and your ban and then come up with a reply\n\nbe patient ....\n\nyour ban will be over soon...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Picanha96","date":"2016-10-23T03:52:27.787+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Then ask!
