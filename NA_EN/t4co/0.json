We were both on discord and talking just fine during the whole thing, so it wasnt our internet connections. Upon closing the game the client just appeared as if neither of us were ingame, and the match wasnt there on match history, its as if the game just ended itself 15 minutes in and the match no longer exists, what gives?","replies":[{"poster":"T4CO","date":"2017-04-28T03:54:26.155+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking up my own name on lolnexus brings up the game as if the game is still going on, but i dont have the reconnect option on the client, and was able to start a custom like normal as if im not in a game.

I just started a ranked game and we passed the remake timer so I know it definitely wasn't a remake issue. I was maybe 10 mins into the game then I suddenly d/cd although my internet was fine. I relogged to get back into the action but there was no option to 'reconnect' and no sign of my match in my match history. I guess it was lucky because my team comp was kinda lame. Would be nice to find out what the problem is here.","replies":[{"poster":"Capt Booty","date":"2017-05-17T14:27:24.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know Broporo answered this question, but it has happened to me quite a lot recently.

We added a couple of the players from both teams afterwards and it was the same thing - game just dropped, everyone had an \"attempting to reconnect,\" then when we exited out there was no option to reconnect to the game, even though LolNexus says the game is still live.

It really sucks, but fortunately, if either one happens then that match won't be recorded and won't actually count for or against you.","replies":[]}]}
