I tried lower my graphics to the lowest quality and I even tried repairing the league client multiple times but nothing seems to work. I don't know what is causing this but it is preventing me from playing in most of the game modes. I could really use some help on fixing this so I can play league properly again.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-25T18:17:21.562+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a recent issue that we're investigating.

Try the following navigation to fix that up.\n\n- Navigate to your League of Legends installation folder. (Typically C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n- Scroll down until you find \"LeagueClient.exe\" and delete the file.\n- Open the client by using \"lol.launcher.admin.exe\"\n- Repair the client by selecting the “?” button in the top right-hand corner of the Patcher window (the first window that appears) and under the options menu, select Repair.\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
