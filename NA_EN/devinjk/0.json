Artifact flopped because a.) the market system in it was awful and b.) it was very complex for a genre where the most played archetype is Aggro/Burn often. The games took very long too, which isnt what most card game players want.\n\nThis seems much simpler, and people are more attached to League lore and characters than Dota characters.","replies":[{"poster":"DevinJK","date":"2019-10-19T22:35:58.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will admit, the lore that the cards in this game provides is really interesting and does flesh out the LoL universe.\n\nI definitely will try the game, but card games aren't my favorite type of game, I've tried Hearthstone but I'd imagine it's not the same. I could be surprised though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"2000shadows","date":"2019-10-16T02:45:01.837+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"nope, not going to be playing that dumpster fire ","replies":[]}]}
