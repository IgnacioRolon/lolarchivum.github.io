When loading into game before the champions appeared I received an error message. Tried to relog into the client and the \"Sign In' button is grey'd out for me and can't be clicked. Attempted to resolve with the hextech tool to no avail. According to the front page of the board there seems to be other users experiencing the same issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-24T18:32:18.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Strange...maybe something is going on?

Ended up resetting my modem after posting the comment and it seems that was enough to prompt the \"client patch\" notification and allow me to log back in. Went ahead and followed your instructions just in case. Attempting to start another game right now, we'll see if the issue is cleared up. As an aside of pure PJSalt, having low mmr in d5 and losing 21lp for a remake feels pretty bad, would be interesting in the future to see if maybe a more normalized loss of lp for connection issues like a dodge penalty possibly.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-24T18:26:21.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Power cycling your router was a good step, because this issue can usually be caused by a network issue struggling to reach the authentication server.  I don't see any issues on our side with authentication servers currently, but it's always good to check.  In this case, I recommend going over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to clear any blocks along the way and reach us.
