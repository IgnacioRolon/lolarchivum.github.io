Players that are dodging your ARAM matches are getting hit with a dodge penalty. Not quite sure why players do this, due to the fact that ARAM will give you a random Champion to test out. It's supposed to be light hearted and fun. \n\no｜๑╹Д╹｜ツ","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-06-06T18:03:58.940+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure if this falls under your jurisdiction, but do you know if there are any planned balance changes for ARAM?
