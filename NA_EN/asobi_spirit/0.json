I had a question, regarding the good ol' Username. As this account was made many many many years ago, the username I created was: --snip--(No password for you boys, sorry!). Back then I couldn't even spell --snip--, and I was still obsessed with TF2. Nowadays, I play more League, more often than I eat breakfast I add.  And since I wanted to change my summoner name, I was wondering if I could change the good ol' Username I log in with. If anyone has any tips, please Share them. :D","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-23T18:38:02.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alas, it's not currently possible to change usernames.  The good news is that usernames are not visible at all to anyone but you (modified your post to remove that), I can totally understand the inconvenience of trying to input a misspelled username.  ><  Sorry about that!","replies":[]}]}
