I got silver 5 in season 7 and didnt get my rewards such as the loading screen silver border. Later researching, I found out that is because I got banned for 14 days for being toxic during 1 game where someone really tilted me. Can someone please tell me if my account is eligible for ranked rewards during season 8 or never can get ranked rewards because I think I changed from the past.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-20T04:52:57.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having been disqualified from 2017's ranked rewards won't automatically disqualify you from a shot at next years! You'll start fresh and will be able to get next years rewards as long as you don't disqualify yourself again.","replies":[{"poster":"FireYoutube","date":"2017-11-20T04:55:50.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much. Season 7 was when I started league and I wasnt fully sure of my boundaries. Now I am fully aware of punishments towards bad behavior and will not do it season 8 so I can get my rewards!","replies":[]}]}]}
