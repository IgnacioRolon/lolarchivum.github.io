I see a lot of people playing for self or with there friends worrying about their K/D ratio. I played like this for a long time until I started watching Ranked matches. It seems that at the end of the day to move up in rank all that matters is that your team wins, Is this true? Even if you are doing very well for yourself within the match if your team loses you lose points. Does individual skill play a part in determining your ranking? And if it doesn&#039;t why are their people playing for self?","replies":[{"poster":"TheXtractor","date":"2015-06-10T13:30:17.834+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its about using your personal skill to benefit the team","replies":[{"poster":"TeemoJenkins","date":"2015-06-10T14:44:04.439+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheXtractor,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=aATjwEcq,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-06-10T13:30:17.834+0000)\n>\n> Its about using your personal skill to benefit the team\n\nThis sums it up perfectly - doesn't matter how hard you win lane if you can't team fight.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Truely Fabulous","date":"2015-06-10T14:42:28.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Normals for self, ranked for team","replies":[{"poster":"CreativeMatrix","date":"2015-06-10T16:33:27.667+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to play brass in an orchestra.

If youre team is lucky enough you will have an ADC who crits every hit. You can be on purple side if youre lucky enough. There will have less people disconnecting on your team while on a lucky team. \n\nOf course you need skill to make sure you dont lose lane and get ahead. Your team might even get ahead, but once the enemy team gets lucky enough theyll win.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darkmind1212","date":"2015-06-10T17:41:18.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are going into ranked games its best to bring a friend along.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-06-10T16:58:07.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a balance.
