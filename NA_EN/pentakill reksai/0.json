Need help!!!!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello League community, recently I've created new acc on NA and what I see is that my \"normal\" ping is 250ms on games and at the beginning I thought it was my PC or internet problem, but it appeared that its always the same ping. Anyone that may have an idea why this ping is so much??? My current stay is on Greece, so I first thought it may be the distance I have from Europe to North America.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-13T22:17:07.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is quite a large amount of ping!  Based on your location, it looks like you have a very wide physical distance between your location and our game servers.  You can use our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to tune things up, but keep in mind that you can't exceed that very large physical distance.  Your best bet would be to play on a closer region.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]}]}
