Smurfs they make the kids  12-5 that need chat moderation not play bc they cant get past lvl 10 without getting stomped on buy the smurfs  So &quot;your content has been removed for racial homophobic slurs&#039; ? what even IM BLACK YOU REMOVE MY COMMENTS FOR TALKING ABOUT MY OWN RACE riot your the one who needs to grow some here kids dont play this game and if they do they aint lvl 30 that also means 99% of the time they aint on the forums  \r\n\r\n\r\nAND yall spending more time removing harmless stuff (yea that msg of mine you removed that was a complement) rather then cleaning up some of the salt in the game yall doing this pointless stuff get your priority&#039;s in line","replies":[{"poster":"Ast√¥lfo","date":"2016-09-09T16:38:54.018+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Or you know, it's called \"acting like a civilized human being when interacting with others\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Karunamon","date":"2016-09-09T16:16:33.653+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like someone got chatbanned and is annoyed that they have to follow the same rules everyone else does.\n\nYou can talk about \"growing a pair\" when you take responsibility for what you put in the chat box.

Trash talking and cursing out teammates is not. \n\nThe vast majority of the player base, and, more importantly, Riot themselves, agree that certain behavior, racial slurs, insulting players skill, taunting enemies, and just in general acting like a jerk, is not allowed. \n\nAt this point you have 2 choices, improve your behavior and treat other players with respect, or continue on your current path and end with your account permabanned.

It's not about being offended, or anything like that. It's just childish to see someone spew nothing but profanities in their post. If your vocabulary only consist of words like that. Maybe get a dictionary and learn some new words. You wouldn't go to your job and act like that, so why do it here when all people want to do is enjoy and relax playing a game?","replies":[]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2016-09-09T17:55:15.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rather than.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-09-09T17:41:07.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Although profanity is mainly a way for people who got salty to try and report you over, the way you explain it is just terrible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Colgate Gator","date":"2016-09-09T16:25:56.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's funny that you claim people need to grow a pair while you need to grow up.","replies":[]}]}
