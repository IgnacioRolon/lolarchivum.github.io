The game will be running great, saying I&#039;m getting around 250-300 fps with a ping of 50 ms, then I&#039;ll throw an ability and it&#039;ll just freeze for half a second, then go back to running smooth.  It happens when others throw abilities too.  And chain 2-3 abilities at once, I could be blind for almost 2 seconds.  Team fights are almost unplayable.  And the entire time I never get a drop in frame or spike in ping.\r\n\r\nI have a good computer (Intel I7 6700, Nvidia GTX 970, 16 Gb RAM, etc) so I wouldn&#039;t think it&#039;s frame drops.  But I also have decent Internet (6-7 Mbs down, 4-5 Mbs up) so I wouldn&#039;t think it&#039;s lag either.  So I&#039;m just at a loss.  I thought maybe someone else knew about this and a way to fix it.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nAlso, I never post on here so I have no idea if this is on the wrong board.  Sorry!","replies":[{"poster":"Arcus Diabolus","date":"2016-10-04T00:35:36.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"95% of your problem seems to be rooted in expecting your computer to run like a god all the time with no wavering whatsoever. \n\nTurn down the FPS to a reasonable number, like 60-100 FPS at most and you should find your game running very smoothly at all times. \n\nYou need to understand that FPS is the enemy of quality. If you want quality, you must sacrifice FPS and vice versa. For every single frame you expect your game to render, it must do so again and again at the speed of your FPS.  When you have a quality spike, the time it takes to render each frame spikes. When you have several frames expected to render already as one is still loading, you will tend to run into periods of time where your computer will mess up until it can catch up. \n\nSo yea, reduce your FPS to something reasonable and you should be fine. You don't need to play over 60 fps for any reason ever anyway. Nothing is going to happen in the course of 1/60th of a second that you wouldn't have seen (or been able to react to) without your current FPS.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-10-03T01:25:44.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First, 200-300 FPS.. just, Lol.

I upgraded from Windows 7.  Just updated it but the problem has happened since before my update.  And idk what a DX3D shader is, let alone have one lol. \n\nI'll try turning on adaptive vsync and see if that helps though. Thanks for the help.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-10-03T23:46:32.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Upgrade right back to 7, if you want stuff to work. Also you have already repaired your LoL install, i assume?\n\nVsync probably wont fix it, it just caps the GPU at the refresh rate of your screen - anything higher than that just decreases quality and overworks the GPU. There is no such thing as a retail monitor that can display 300 Fps, no matter what the CoDBabies tell you.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AdeBug","date":"2016-10-03T23:19:26.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes Ryze's and Sion's ults.
