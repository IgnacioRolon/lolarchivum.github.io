I cut all the files from the Riot Games folder in my C: driven and moved them to my E: drive. Once logging in, the game seemed fine, but now the client is acting incredibly slow at times. I couldn't ban champions in champ select, and i couldn't pick lanes during a draft pick. So, frustrated, i cut all the files again and moved them back to my C: drive to fix the issue, and am still facing the same issue. For whatever reason, when ever this happens to my client, my internet on my second monitor just stops deciding to work, and i have to wait for it to settle. It's gotten worse now and i've begun to disconnect form the client all together and can't even play a ranked game, let alone any draft.Trying to repair found now corrupted files and didn't fix anything either.","replies":[{"poster":"Jujuace","date":"2016-08-16T21:46:52.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After using the hextech repair tool to reinstall my client, the client seemed to run a bit smoother, but i'm still facing the problem where my computer will just stop, trying to play ranked, and the \"ready to play\" button will show the ready button to press to get into champ select. upon pressing, the button disappears and i'm just sitting there waiting for the game to tell me i have failed to accept the afk thing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-16T18:17:10.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like the game files may have become corrupt during your transfer.  I suggest downloading the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to automatically perform a clean reinstall, and start you off with a fresh slate.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
