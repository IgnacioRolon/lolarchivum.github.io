Unless you kicked the power cord off, a pc will shut off due to safety precautions and faulty hardware.  A [leaverbuster ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) penalty would only occur after multiple leaves and not just 1 game.  It would also apply regardless of intent because it still causes others a negative experience.  Hopefully, that helps clear things up but let me know if you need help with your shutting down issue!","replies":[{"poster":"LOST4EVR","date":"2016-08-19T18:48:24.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I've found Power issue where is main cabel to plug in PC it's bit broken so yeah I'll fix it as far as possible Thanks!","replies":[]}]}]}
