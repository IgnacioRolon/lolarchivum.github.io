I don't think that's nearly enough time. \r\nI queued up for a ranked game and when the game went to the loading screen, it said I was disconnected. \r\nI started monitoring my Wi-Fi connection and restarted league. Still, I was getting a disconnected message, but my diagnostics was not picking up any issues.\r\nTried restarting again, but this time I'm hit with a slow log in, further delaying me.\r\nFinally I load again, but now it said the game no longer exists. \r\n\r\nIt's disgruntling to try your hardest to reconnect to find that the 3 minutes are over.","replies":[{"poster":"Raxistaicho","date":"2016-10-25T21:50:24.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, 3 minutes doesn't work at all, Riot needs to knock it down to 2.
