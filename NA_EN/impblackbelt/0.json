Refuses to reconnect after a few minutes, so I exit the game. The beta client says I'm disconnected, even though the rest of my internet still works. After closing the client out entirely, the client won't even log me in, stuck at authenticating for 5-10 minutes before giving me an error and kicking me back to login.
