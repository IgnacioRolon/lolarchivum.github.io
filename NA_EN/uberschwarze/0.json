Just prepared to patch for 7.7 on the updated client and I got an error message saying that the patching had failed. Error code 004.

With the new 7.7 update, I randomly got the 004 error and haven't been able to play any game since. I've did a clean reinstall THREE TIMES(!) and let it patch for hours on end, with no result. Anyone got a solution? I can't help but think Riot just send us an update with an error inside it, because it doesn't make sence it would suddenly stop working.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-05T20:55:51.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This error code is usually the updated client's way of saying that it's failing to stay connected to the patching server and grab updates.
