However she is still in champ select with me dodging because I cannot select a champion, as I am not at the screen. I have looked around but can find nothing similar to this, so I have made this post.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-13T02:03:30.886+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It almost sounds as if something cut off your network's connection to the game server you were going to be playing on.

I have used most of these listed options now, as well as the hextech repair tool. After the hextech repair tool alone I did not receive the issue, however it was not an every game one to begin with.
