See I always had semi decent mechanics for the champs/roles I played but would still lose. I would blame my team and other people for not helping me win. I would get mad and not have any fun. I recently started a new mindset and things have been going great. So here are my secrets to success.\n\n\n1. Don't play league soloq if you are having a bad day or bad mood. This causes tilt.\n2. Don't blame your team even if they suck. If you die it's your fault and yours only.\nI need to make a sub bullet on this because this is the biggest issue I think. If you die, it's your fault. Yeah your team might suck at team fighting and yeah they probably focused the wrong person, but you died because you played it bad. Coming to grips with this hurts your pride and can tick you off but it is true. \n3. It is crazy how toxicness can ruin a game, I know this because I was pretty toxic. Just press mute, or if you can't say something nice then don't say anything. Though praising your team for good plays really raises morales.\n4. Sometimes you might loose. It happens, sometimes a team might have that one player who doesn't group and yeah he might cause you the game but I can say that this happens maybe twice out of 20 games.\n5. Never surrender. Over these past 20 games there has been at least 4 that were considered \"lost\". Drag out the game, one ace late game can let you push all the way to nexus.\n6. This is to answer some of the comments, can you split and win? Yes. Will it help you as you climb? No. I've come to realize how important team play in the last couple of days. As you climb you will see that people get better and you can rely more on your team. If the enemy is smart, they send one champ to stop the split. There enemy gets a 4v4 and its 50/50 whether or not they win.\n7. Play for fun. This is huge. If your not having fun...why play? This can make a huge difference in toxicness. ITS A GAME! ENJOY IT.\n8. Pick your fights, just because your team is going ham, you dont have to. Realize that if you have a cleanup champ, then do just that... Don't be initiating with kat (unless you get that first reset)\n9. Team comps!!!!! Dodge queue if you have to. If they have a huge team advantage take the 5 minute wait and queue up later, lose 3lp instead of 15-20\n\nIll add more later :D\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2015-03-10T20:40:33.609+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"OR main jungle/ top, split push while greedy low elo players fight mid lane. Just push all lanes where the enemy isn't currently at and watch as you reach level 18 while everyone else is 14-15. Works better with champs who take towers ( udyr, shyvanna, wuking)","replies":[{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2015-03-10T20:45:23.021+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"just be smart about it. cuz if those greedy players get wiped in a 4v5, yer screwed.","replies":[{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2015-03-10T21:10:15.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Thryale,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NjZOgPi9,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-03-10T20:45:23.021+0000)\n>\n> just be smart about it. cuz if those greedy players get wiped in a 4v5, yer screwed.\n\nNot true. I just keep pushing. Let them revive and defend nexus towers. At least you'll get inhib to give you SOMETHING as opposed to you backing and dying trying to defend 1v5 and not getting anything","replies":[{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2015-03-10T23:47:13.958+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"that doesn't exactly work at the 40 min mark.

Can it work? Yes. Is it sustaining for climbing and playing at higher elo? Not really. Eventually you will have to learn how to team fight.
