Right now we seem to be routing both directions towards the Dallas interconnect point with them.

Before we start looking at factors that may be causing these issues on the ISP end, I'd first like to confirm that the issue does not lay on your end of things.

I've noticed a few patterns. Everyone seems to be from the same general area Between Louisiana and Texas. The lag only rises at night, which could be explained by peak traffic but that really can't be the case.  It's seems everyone that has been experiencing the rise in latency has Suddenlink as their ISP. Once again, i don't think having Suddenlink as an ISP is the problem but the facts say differently until proven otherwise. Even if peak hours traffic would cause our connection to lag then we would be experiencing said lag with other games and media devices but we don't. I hoping Riot will see this and be able to shed some light. There are many posts on the boards with similar experiences. I personally didn't even know about Boards till i sought out a solution for this problem. No telling how many others are experiencing this lag and aren't vocal about it.\nEdit: Spelling","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SonicBliss","date":"2015-12-01T03:42:44.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So there are two things that can cause the problems you are having:\n1. Evening is when Peak Hours generally affect your internet speeds. This means that your ISP is having trouble delivering the proper internet speeds to your modem because of an influx of too many people trying to use it. Basically, avoid playing during peak hours or change your ISP to a better one.\n2. Something else may be eating up your bandwidth. For example someone in your house could be watching Netflix or a similar streaming service on the same network as you and eating away at your bandwidth so it's harder to connect to the Riot servers. Try closing any  programs that aren't League of Legends, including anything running in the background like steam and make sure no other device in your household is connected to your modem/internet then see if you are still encountering lag issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Seotaijì","date":"2015-12-01T03:53:43.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are more than two possible reasons for this lag but option #1 is highly unlikely as we all have different ISP.
