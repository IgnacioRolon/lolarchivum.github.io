It was one of the things that define the Champion.  it is perfect for waiting creep waves or making some banter (like lulu&#039;s laugh) and it won&#039;t stop until we make it stop. But new skin has only like 2 seconds laugh emote. I wonder what is the reason behind this. I love the new skin and I plan to buy it day one but this is bugging me a lot. I saw some youtubers who review the skin is dissapointed at that as well. What do you think?","replies":[{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2016-09-21T09:55:25.084+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"That's the point.

So removing a thing which many people love to use is way to go? plus her new VO sounds crazier than her old VO. if that's the point why remove the laugh?","replies":[{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2016-09-21T10:37:31.963+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"As much as her laugh is \"important\", I think it's forgettable. If anything it's just her quotes themselves or her Kit that is more iconic then something that is used to Taunt. The looping laugh was unqiue, but not so much iconic or necessary. \nShe doesn't sound Crazier to me, moreso just annoyed at the turn of events. She depicts herself more as a clicky rebel, then an actual lunatic in the SG skinline. \nThe point is to take a shot at her classic skin, hence the joke towards her laugh no longer looping.

I can see where both of y'all are coming from; its a jab at the classic counterpart and its annoying spam-ability, but at the same time it seems like such a staple of her character and personality at least in my opinion.  That and the skin itself plays on the idea of a crazy gun-toting psychopath endowed with celestial powers, divine golden rules ~~of engagement~~, and forced to go to a fancy training academy a la Beacon to learn about restraint and a thing or two about friendship with her new teammates.  One can imagine the inner conflict.  Id be ok with the choice of you could keep using the laugh emote over and over, and then at some point 4 or 5 uses in Kuro just gives up and lets her infinite cycle through.  Best of both worlds, wouldn't you say Riot?","replies":[]}]}
