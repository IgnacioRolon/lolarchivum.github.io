Sometimes I just get a black screen, sometimes it will show a frozen loading screen, but with no players. I'm unable to tab out when this happens, so I have to ctrl+alt+del to open task manager and end the program. It's a hit or miss whether or not I can reopen the client and load into the game successfully. I've never had issues like this with Skype or other voice communication software (such as Ventrilo). Has anyone else had this issue or have any suggestions for me?
