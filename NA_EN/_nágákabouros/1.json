That Day One Chest is designed to give you a random skin of 975 RP or lower for one of the champions you owned. If none of those skins are available, it will just give you a random skin for a random champion. \n\nIn your case: the only champion you owned when you opened that chest was Illaoi. Sadly, the only skin she has right now is Void Bringer, which is over 975 =/ . Since the Day One chest doesn't count 1350 RP Skins, it gave you a random one which turned out to be Woad King Darius. I hate that you ended up with a skin you can't use right now, but I won't be able to switch that skin for a different one.","replies":[{"poster":" Nágákabouros","date":"2017-06-03T06:14:42.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"okay, i don't like the bad news but thanks for explaining","replies":[]}]},{"poster":" Nágákabouros","date":"2017-06-03T00:52:49.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now i baught yasuo because he was in my shop (i didn't own hin when i opened hextech)","replies":[]}]}
