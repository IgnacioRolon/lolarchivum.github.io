My reasoning for this appears underneath Fiddlesticks tattered cloak, those Eyes peeping through the rips &amp; tears of his body.\nhttps://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/02_Fiddesticks_Concepts_itlamu210ooklfvzf5hz.jpg\n\nWhen I think of Fiddles having more than one voice, I'd like to think that they're all coming from whatever is underneath that Tattered Burlap visage.\n\nThoughts ladies &amp; gents?","replies":[{"poster":"iiGazeii","date":"2019-08-25T00:47:18.766+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd love to see Fiddle get multiple voices, but not at the same time. I want Fiddle to play back \"recordings\" of his victims. Give him lots of unique voice lines of past victims, like the sounds of children crying, people calling for help, various sounds he would have used to lure people to him. As the game progresses, he'd also gather lines from his victims, playing back their taunts and on-kill lines.\n\nImagine the opener to his ult being a little girl saying \"He's coming~\" as he channels, or he transforms to something horrible and you hear a woman scream \"A monster!\".\n\nLike a monster from horror movies, he'd have no voice of his own, just sounds and words he's gathered over centuries to lower people's guard and lure them to their death.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-25T00:19:45.266+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen people suggest this before, but the same issue keeps cropping up: They'd have to pay 5 VAs. Chances are that meeting the design goal will mean it having very bizarre speech patterns and mimicking the cries of its victims (For instance, as it's attacking its enemy it will say \"No, please stop! For the love of all that's holy stop!\" because that's the reaction it comes to expect).\n\nAlso Fiddlesticks B is best Fiddlesticks. He looks like an executioner.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2019-08-25T00:25:06.827+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Paying 5 people isn't hard.. Kayn and Rhaast are voiced by two people.

I rank them C, D, B, A.\n\nThe eyes on C are an amazing design choice (imagine how arched his back would have to be to make them visible in a top down view) and the upright head makes more sense for a mimic.\n\nHe does lack a Scythe, but that can be fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-26T03:37:56.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"B actually kinda looks like the original, though, and I'm sure that'd please more Fiddle mains than not.","replies":[{"poster":"mzicio","date":"2019-08-26T09:06:31.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm confident that the general consensus on the reddit is that C is the best one.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
