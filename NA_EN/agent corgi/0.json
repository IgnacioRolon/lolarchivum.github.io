I can make you a fine bargain... but you gotta be willing to pay the price.\" Strike a deal with Tahm Kench, the River King.","url":"https://youtu.be/u9RM4HwwoKs","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/u9RM4HwwoKs/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"&quot;Boy the world is one River, and I am it&#039;s king. Ain&#039;t no place I ain&#039;t been, ain&#039;t no place I can&#039;t go again. And the price is a miniscule thing. You see, I got hungers that ain&#039;t easily fed but those finest tables ain&#039;t never got a seat for me. So I need men like yourself, to Let me In.&quot;\r\n\r\nI remember back when I first heard this excerpt from Tahm&#039;s Trailer, this combined with the Voice acting completely won me over. When Phreak mentioned that Tahm was a &quot;Silver-tongued Demon&quot; in the he champion spotlight, I couldn&#039;t agree more with that lable. Tahm even has up to 15 minutes of special interactions with Enemies/allies/purchased items.\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/s7nn0mvqPpw\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso as a fan of Tank Supports, he also has one of my favorite playstyles to date in the supporting role.\r\n\r\nTo the team that designed this champion, thank you guys.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2018-06-04T15:52:29.651+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanx!

A vast majority of all the VO/SFX since his release have been great.\n\nLike, look at the list, by order of release:\n\n* Tahm: best taunts, wonderful accent and acting\n* Kindred: great emotions and synergy between the two half\n* Illaoi: not the best VO I think, but I really like her character and philosophy, so she still has a dear place in my heart\n* Jhin: the opposite, I really do NOT like his character, but this VO is really great, with all the ambiance sound, and the half-lost musing\n* Aurelion Sol: the acting on this one is formidable, and the \"starry SFX\" are a perfect match\n* Taliyah: nothing very striking, but she has a very genuine and optimistic feel that I enjoy\n* Kled: I can't help but laugh every time I play Kled, and I do play Kled a lot. Not only is the acting an extraordinary feat, but the scripting of the VO is also wonderful. All the triggers when you kill someone in a clutch duel, all the \"dialogues\" with Skaarl, it really adds to the ambiance.\n* Ivern: it's Taliyah++. Like her, he's super optimistic and cheerful, but he also has this little undefinable thing that really makes him feel very different and characteristic, and I really love his absurd side.\n* Camille: not a fan, I find this VO a little too \"simple\", but it's straight to the point and efficient, and it works well\n* Rakan/Xayah: the \"couple\" lines are great, and even beyond the technical side of it, they really add a lot of depth to their relation without having to dig into the lore outside of the game.\n* Kayn: the VO in 3 parts was very original and works well to give you a different feel game to game\n* Ornn: the gruff old man VO is cool, but what I really love are all the SFX and ambiance music. (Side-note: I still regularly listen to the Path to Earth-Home regularly :) )\n\nSo, over those 13 champs, I'd say 10 are extremely good and original. That's a good success rate, if you ask me :)\n\nAlso, even if they are a bit older, a special note for Braum, Rek'Sai, and Bard.\n\nOn the other hand, I'm a little disappointed in the last 3 champs, they aren't bad by a long shot, but I don't think they rise to the level of the above list. In my humble opinion, they are all like Camille, efficient but not remarkable. Though, I do like the SFX when Pyke executes you with R. But I hope for more great things.\n\n(Sorry to have derailed your Tahm appreciation into a VO/SFX appreciation thread ^^')","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blakiepug","date":"2018-06-04T17:10:08.489+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tahm Kench is my favorite champion. :3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ifneth","date":"2018-06-09T22:35:03.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:223}} “I will not, must not, and _can_ not be benched.”","replies":[]}]}
