The contrast between the two characters is what makes the champion. \"Don't make the Yeti angry, you wouldn't like him when he's angry\" has turned into \"you can't make the yeti angry.\" This is a very disappointing change for me and it discourages me about the future of this game. Are they really going to ruin the thematic of all the old champs? Most of the recent reworks have been okay, and stayed true to the champs theme (with the exception of Gangplank, rip), but if this is truly what the Nunu VU looks like, I'm concerned with who's doing these Visual Updates.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahpe","date":"2018-08-13T01:41:17.392+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"How are they changing the thematic drastically?","replies":[{"poster":"Psychedelia","date":"2018-08-13T01:45:05.214+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":39,"body":"Willump is supposed to be a Yeti, a dangerous beast capable of destruction, etc. The whole theme of the champ is that this whimsical child was able to gain the friendship of such a beast, and they travel around together beating things up.
