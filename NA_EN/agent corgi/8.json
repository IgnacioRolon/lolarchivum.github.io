This will be text only.)\n[Edit: **I am in no way, shape or form asking for Mordekaiser to be buffed.** This is just a simple concept for a skin &amp; a champion shouldn't have to be buffed just to recieve stuff like this, regardless of who that champion is.]\n-----------\n\nSo with the recent additions to the Dark Star Line (Jhin, Shaco &amp; Karma) &amp; Mordekaiser recieving a complete relaunch, I asked myself \"what if Mordekaiser joined that line-up?\". \n\nWith his new lore (being an ancient spirit of a warrior king that simply refused to fade away into oblivion) and simply how cool his ultimate would look with a Darkstar Theme, I began piecing this skin together &amp; I'd figure I'd share what I have.\n------------------\n[Basic Rundown of Skin Lore, W.I.P]:\nA Constellation that simply refused to be absorbed by the Darkstar, Mordekaiser became a Malevolent Cosmic Entity hellbent on consuming the cosmos. Gaining more &amp; more power with each Galaxy Consumed.\n-----------\n[Passive: Darkness Rise] \nGalaxy VFX with Darkstar Colors (Similar to Aurelion's Q, only difference would be the color scheme.)\n\n[Q: Obliterate]\nThe impact zone would have a dark purplish hue to it. Not much changed here.\n\n[W: Indestructible]\nFirst cast: Morde's chest would be surrounded with a Purple/Black energy cloud.\nSecond cast: The energy cloud would be absorbed into his chest.\n\n[E: Deaths Grasp]\nA Claw similar to the one seen in Darkstar Cho'Gaths Joke Animation (where Cho high fives a disembodied hand) sprouts out of tbe ground, pulling enemies towards Mordekaiser.\n\n[R: Death Realm]\nMorde points his Mace at an enemy, bringing them to the edge of the cosmos, just outside of the Darkstar's Gravitational pull. The arena would have a Galactic theme &amp; you might be able to place the Darkstar itself somewhere in the backround.\n--------------\nThis is all I have jotted down at the moment so far. I feel that this could very well be a decent 1350 skin for Mordekaiser if they chose to create a new skin for him in the future.\n\nThoughts?\n\n[EDIT]\nAs of January 15th 2020, Riot has announced that Mordekaiser will be recieving a skin and they showed off some Official Concept art of Dark Star Mordekaiser. \n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}} \n\nhttps://imgur.com/o9oOihE","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2020-02-06T00:27:20.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's all read them post dates, cuz this'n's old old, so I'm locking it. \n\nIf you have any questions about this moderation action, don't hesitate to reach out to the Boards Moderation Team via:\n\n* The [**NA Boards Discord**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/7rtKBZLi-boards-moderation-discord-verification)\n* The [**Discuss the Boards**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation) sub-board","replies":[]},{"poster":"MalignMetal","date":"2019-06-18T15:05:19.423+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"The downvotes  are just Morde haters.
