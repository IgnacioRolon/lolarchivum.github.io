To those beyond its borders, Noxus is brutal, expansionist and threatening, yet those who look beyond its warlike exterior see an unusually inclusive society, where the strengths and talents of its people are respected and cultivated.","url":"https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_GB/region/noxus/","image":"https://universe-meeps.leagueoflegends.com/v1/assets/images/factions/noxus_splash.jpg"},"up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"After reading the Updated Biography from the Noxian Lore update, I&#039;m actually Impressed with how the Lore is being rewritten since it explains alot about champions &amp; gives us insight as to what kind of person/creature they are in the world of Runeterra.\r\nWhat stuck out for me &amp; pretty much has my full attention is Leblanc&#039;s relationship to Mordekaiser. Previously, I thought Mordekaiser had ties to the Shadow Isles &amp; nothing more than that. Now I feel like there&#039;s more to Mordekaiser than we&#039;re being led onto since they mentioned the Immortal Bastion (which basically was his Stronghold) in the New Lore.\r\nHonestly between the Lore Updates &amp; some Interactions I&#039;m seeing with Mordekaiser, I&#039;m hoping Mordekaiser is selected sometime later this year for a VGU. This way we can see how he is connected to the Immortal Bastion &amp; Noxus in the new continuity. \r\n\r\n&quot;My army will soon storm your gates, Revenant.&quot; - {{champion:83}} \r\n&quot;You give the dead purpose, Mordekaiser. I give them meaning.&quot; - {{champion:30}}","replies":[{"poster":"Znoxyboy","date":"2018-02-06T16:25:29.237+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morde was updated with this long ago (2016/2017 I think) so this is nothing new. but if you're interested you can go read the shadow isles lore and the morde lore on universe ^^","replies":[]},{"poster":"DWT12345","date":"2018-02-06T00:54:23.703+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mordekaiser's had that lore for quite awhile.

I've been enjoying Mordelaiser's lore scraps quite a bit since they started getting updated but didn't think there would be anything major in anyone's lore outside of the shadow isles since he was so old.  The 'well' mentioned in there reminds me of Varus' lore too, cant wait to see how that all connects.","replies":[]}]}
