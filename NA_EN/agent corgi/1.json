The theme has a 3:5 ratio of sections with flute vs. sections without.","replies":[{"poster":"Talondor","date":"2018-08-24T17:27:18.244+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi DarkSoul1994 & thanks for your question! Very early on I had some explorations that were purely carried by flute, however it felt more lonely than we wanted. Given that it's now both Nunu & Willump, it made us think that perhaps there could be a duet-like quality to the piece where Flute & Viol Da Gamba play their own lines, double the melody, and even call/answer in some sections. One way of listening to the piece is as follows...\n\nFlute = Nunu\nViol Da Gamba (Cello sound) = Willump\nLow Orchestra & Drums = Freljord\nVoice (at the end) = Layka\n\nWhile Flute still played a critical role in the piece, once we interweaved these various musical elements between background/foreground it started to feel warmer. Ultimately attempting to hit that balance of warmth, hope, and adventure in the face of a very cold and sometimes lonely Freljord.
