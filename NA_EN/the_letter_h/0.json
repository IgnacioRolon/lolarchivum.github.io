It seems like there has to be something going on with them, and since people are starting to get confused (I've been seeing questions like this all over), it seems like we deserve an explanation as to why the skins are so late in showing, and especially why you don't have a release date.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-25T00:21:36.444+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We purposefully don't give out a release date because we sometimes do encounter problems or bugs very late in the development right before we want to ship them to live.  Rather than dash people's hopes with a release date that we miss, we say during the patch to give us some wiggle room to polish them up as much as possible before releasing them!  We want them to make a great first impression after all ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"anacondazz","date":"2016-05-25T02:12:37.293+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the heads up!

Usually it takes 3 to 7 days because next week will be the end of patch 6.10 cycle and releaseing 3 new skins few days before next patch would be dumb. God knows why they are delaying it so much but maybe there is few bugs that they want to wait to fix it until next patch.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TheBruiserAbuser","date":"2016-05-23T23:59:11.875+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean they always say \"During patch \".\"\" the skins will be available\" never the day the patch releases.
