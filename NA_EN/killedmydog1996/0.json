The mute wasn&#039;t the reason as to why I created it because I&#039;m unbothered, however, I met the player yet again today and found their attitude still shocking. \n\nFor context: \nI &quot;flamed&quot; yesterday in response to the enemy; the Tristana (player in question) remained quiet, and his or her 4 friends did too, up until they broke down the game and were about to close out-- at which point they agreed to surrender. \n**I am not contesting the mute**, however, having it removed after this would be nice. Punishment of this player and their friends is what I am looking for here. \n\nNot only have they intentionally lost a game-- using /ff as a tool to lose just as they are about to win, being in a 4-man premade, having 1 random person lose out for no other reason but their &quot;haha we won but we lost funny&quot; joke.  I&#039;m pretty sure they&#039;ve broken a rule there, but:\n\n\nPlaced with this horrible person yet again, they send this message in /all chat. \n<removed by moderation>\nTranscribed: &quot;What did your feedback report say yesterday Teemo?&quot; and &quot;Oh, that&#039;s right you can&#039;t use all chat&quot;\n\nNow I thought that reporting players would block you from playing with/against someone again. \nThe player clearly didn&#039;t report me to make the game a better place, they&#039;re a bad person too; they did it, simply, out of spite for me-- much like their surrender vote. \n\nProof that they&#039;re premade: \n<removed by moderation>\n\nNow I know that this community is warming up for some sick metal gymnastics, but the single point this thread serves to prove is that: **These players, who abuse the report system to later brag and taunt their victims and intentionally lose games** should be punished, as was I. \n\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-12-13T04:48:21.590+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't allow for naming and shaming.\n\nWhat you described sounds pretty unique in terms of what's reportable/punishable, so I'd submit a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) about this matter.\n\nIf you have any questions about this moderation, feel free to reach out to us in the [Boards Discord](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/7rtKBZLi-boards-moderation-discord-verification).","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-12-13T07:34:36.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Periscope,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=ExRvYm1U,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-12-13T04:48:21.590+0000)\n>\n> We don&#x27;t allow for naming and shaming.\n> \n> What you described sounds pretty unique in terms of what&#x27;s reportable/punishable, so I&#x27;d submit a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) about this matter.\n> \n> If you have any questions about this moderation, feel free to reach out to us in the [Boards Discord](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/7rtKBZLi-boards-moderation-discord-verification).\n\nThere is a problem with this removal.\n\nThe image where the shamed players were named is still displayed in the Boards thread listing, and therefore still accessible in that page's source as a thumbnail element.\n\nIt doesn't seem to be cache-related, because I've hard-refreshed (bypassing the cache) as well as visited the thread listing in a separate browser, and the image is still there.

If you act toxic and get reported then there will always be the possibility of being punished.  If your teammates act toxic and your report them, then the same holds for them.  If you and your teammates all act toxic to each other and report each other then you all may get punished.  \n\nSo, odds are if they were as toxic as you said and you reported them then they got punished to.  Maybe you were at a more severe punishment level then them.  Thus, your punishment was “worse”.  \n\nTLDR: You can only control your own behavior and only your own behavior can get you punished.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mlm olo mlm","date":"2018-12-13T07:21:35.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I guess there is no easy solution.
