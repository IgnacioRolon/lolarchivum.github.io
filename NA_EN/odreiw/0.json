No such email arrived, in inbox, spam, etc. I manually told it to send a verification email. Similarly, no such email arrived.\n\nI can&#039;t submit a support ticket about this, nor can I submit a support ticket about what I actually care about.\n\nEdit: I'm gonna post one of these every day until something happens.","replies":[{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2017-07-28T06:47:37.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Visit [this link](https://account.leagueoflegends.com/na/en/protect) to verify your email.
