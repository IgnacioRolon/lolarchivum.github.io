So I tried doing a couple of different things like running as administrator and reinstalling. When league finished installing it still had the same problem. I looked around some forums trying to find a solution when I found that some you could open the client via the folder for it. (leagueclient.exe) When I tried this I got the message\n\n C:/Riot Games/League of Legends/LeagueClient.exe \nThe file or directory is corrupted and unreadable  \n\nAfter I saw this I thought maybe if I just uninstalled the client via the control panel and reinstalled the game it would fix itself. Unfortunately it didn't. If anyone knows how to fix this please let me know league is my \nfavorite game that I have probably put around $150 in, which would suck if I couldn't play it\n\n\nEDIT: I managed to fix this by manually removing everything league. By that I mean I put league in the recycling bin, delete it there, went to the control panel went to programs and features in the control panel and deleted it. and finally this one will take some knowledge. if you have a windows computer open the start menu and type regedit and hit enter. Once your there click on HKEY_CURRENT_USER. Go under software and keep scrolling down until you see launcher app, client and there is a thing in between but I forgot what it was, but it is the only thing between them so it shouldn't be too hard to find. delete all of those. Then reinstall the game and it should work. I have never seen anyone create a board on this so I hope this helps if you had the same trouble I did","replies":[{"poster":"D a t i s","date":"2018-02-09T02:08:10.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same problem, for some reason my client got corrupted.\n\nC:/Riot Games/League of Legends/LeagueClient.exe\nThe file or directory is corrupted and unreadable \n\nI fixed the problem:\n\nBy default in the game main folder (League of Legends main folder) there is only 4 exe file,\n1.

It'd be a little hard to run the game if the entire client itself is corrupted. We should be able to fix this pretty easily by using the [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool). \n\nGrab that tool, and run it with **reinstall and clean uninstall**. That will make sure you start fresh without any damaged files. Let me know if that doesn't work out though!","replies":[{"poster":"notaturtle2","date":"2017-05-27T04:01:40.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did everything you said and it didn't work.
