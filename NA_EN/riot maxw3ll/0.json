After assessing players' feedback, we ultimately decided that we went too far in pulling damage out of him in our quest for a more CC-laden tank. We agree that part of Zac’s pattern of diving the back line and doing damage is core to who he is as a champion and unfortunately, Zac players felt that after diving in, he wasn't able to accomplish anything more than just knocking people around. With that in mind, we're reverting his reworked ultimate and W.\r\n\r\nFull Changelist:\r\n**Q - Stretching Strikes**\r\nCOOLDOWN :: 13-9 seconds >>> 15-9 seconds\r\n\r\n**W - Unstable Matter**\r\nNow does 2% of a target's max health per 100 ability power as magic damage\r\n\r\n**R - Let's Bounce **\r\nREMOVING OLD ULTIMATE\r\nNEW ULTIMATE :: Zac bounces 4 times gaining 20-50% movement speed over the duration, but is unable to use Q or E and can't attack. The first bounce deals 140/210/280 (+40% AP) damage on a target, reduced by 50% for subsequent bounces on the same target. The first bounce on a given target knocks them back for 1 second, and all bounces on the same target slow by 20% \r\n\r\nThe ultimate is a straight revert to what it was before we changed Zac-- four AoEs, each 1 second after the last that do damage and knock up once per cast. The W is another revert, where we basically just added in the AP ratio we took out. Q is not being changed, but the cooldown is a little longer to pull more power out of Zac’s CC and into his damage. This should open up build paths for AP bruiser Zac again, although we expect full tank to still be the default build. \r\nThese changes should be on PBE soon for testing/feedback, with a tentative plan to ship the final changelist in 9.11. We hope to generate some conversation on what y’alls opinions on this list are and go from there.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowParker","date":"2019-05-13T18:52:05.029+0000","up_votes":81,"down_votes":7,"body":"So,\n\nI know the new q is a painpoint for a lot of players because they could do top zac before.

Oh we uh....are doing a uhhhhh rework and just reverting changes from 2 years ago?\n\nThe ult now gives the player options, they have a super fed nasus or someone else I can choose to ult them over a wall out of the fight.

Seems super lazy and boring.  Why not leave the skill in the Zac players hands.  If I make a clutch jump and land on the carry (assuming full charged jump) then I should be able to relocate them.  And if I miss that jump I should be punished for it.

They are a tank with a lot of CC, sustainability and survivability built into there kits. \n A tank's role is to absorb damage and CC the opponent. Every champion that is label a  tank has a form of CC. So this quote doesn't make much sense, \"we ultimately decided that we went too far in pulling damage out of him in our quest for a more CC-laden tank\". Zac as a champion is not supposed to deal damage, Zac's main function,  like most other tanks, is DISRUPTION. I have played Zac pre and post rework and the play style is very similar. From my time playing I have not noticed the reduction in damage.  In old zac's build no damage items were built, for the exception of the seldom liandry's torment. But for the most part was built pure tank. His job isn't to one shot a carry its to put your team into a better strategic position than the enemy.  So, i am unsure why a tank needs to deal additional damage. I would rather him have a better opportunity to out play than deal damage.\nSecondly zac's utl. His current ult is so, much more impactful compared to his old one. Zac's current ult is a  game changer. And ony one that says \" felt that after diving in, he wasn't able to accomplish anything more than just knocking people around\" is not playing the current zac. This sounds to me much more like the old zac. zac would dive in, disperse and disrupt the enemy team. I never looked to deal much damage it was more to put the enemy team at a disadvantage. This is where a major issue comes in. The damage might have been increase on old but so, was his survivability. Back with old zac GA was still available to any champion but now it is allocated to only AD champions. Previously when I would play zac GA was my third item. Jungle item(cinderhulk), Warmog, and GA. The GA allow Zac 2 forms of a revive. So when he would dive into the enemy team, this extra form of a revive was very beneficial.  But now that Zac does not build GA any more, this is why Zac's current ult is much better it gives zac that extra form survivability. \nZac's current utl is so, versatile,  It can be used to peal, escape and  catch. It has so many uses and it gives Zac the ability to outplay which he was lacking previously. The ability to dive into an enemy team and have the power to pull a portion of the team away is Zac's best asset. The feeling when you have  a good ult(example abducting a fed carry) is like nothing else. Old Zac never had that, feeling of accomplishment, because he really had nothing to outplay with. The ability to outplay the enemy team  is very hard with old zac because he lack the necessary skills, he would really just dive in and \"wasn't able to accomplish anything more than just knocking people around\". \nWhen I saw this post it does not fit with zac's role as  a tank  and it reminded me a lot more of old zac than new. So again I do not understand the reasoning behind the changes. Zac is not over powered nor is he under powered.  Zac finally has the ability to out play, turn a game and be more impactful. Why take that away.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheSecretWeapon","date":"2019-05-13T19:37:34.131+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"The only thing I would change is giving back the old W flat damage back.

Then I use the current ult to relocate those people who engaged on my ADC to away from my ADC - sometimes even over walls so that they cant get back (unless they have flash or some other way to get back). \n\nthe old knockback was not anywhere NEAR as good as a peel as the current ult is.  The ult can be used in so many ways as it is now, can be an escape for Zac, pull someone over a wall to peel, engage and pull them back to your team.  Hell ive even pulled the other jungler over the wall then jumped myself back to smite baron/dragon.  none of that is possible if its changed back to a simple knockback.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Wendígo","date":"2019-05-13T19:04:22.593+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"Can we revert Skarner too now with all these class update reworks getting reverted?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jando","date":"2019-05-13T19:08:49.545+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":6,"body":"With 500k mastery points and over a thousand games played on Zac (prob 10% of that being on the reworked Zac), this post brings me a level of joy that I didn't know I could experience.

Currently he has no escapes other than to channel his slingshot, now he can channel his old ult and live possibly with the added disruption and MS. Plus having him bounce around the enemy team creates a great deal of chaos that I loved and missed dearly in his old kit. His passive IMO staying at 5 mins is a huge problem with him right now. I think a good way to fix that is for every blob that revives him also lowers the cd by 30 seconds or 1 min. His current ultimate is such a hassle to have them just run off your body or just flash away. The only way I can imagine fixing that is basically making them unable to flash or simply walk off your body mid ult. Those are easy and really good QOL changes for either version of him. I personally have found his new ult useless since release since you're unable to even move, it simply took away way too much of his old mobility. With this revert I wont simply think freelo whenever the enemy team picks Zac now. I will look at him now again as an actual champ to fear.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lazy Justice 1","date":"2019-05-18T00:22:01.328+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Back when before his first rework in 2017 I play A LOT of Zac in the top lane. I loved how he played in top, but the rework really made him unfun to play in that role. The changes to the W don't bother me too much, although I go full tank, it's nice for the ap bruiser Zacs to get some love. After reading some of the comments here I agree that putting in both Ults and Qs much like Pyke Q could be very interesting. Making Zac a champion focused around quick taps or holding down the button to differing abilities. He already has something like that with how he can charge his E, why not go all the way in on that concept and make him stand out that way?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Red Fr0st","date":"2019-05-29T18:12:13.627+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool , 2 weeks of \"testing\" and 0 replies , good revert , thx riot","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mrcookiejar","date":"2019-05-24T05:42:37.322+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Here we go...\n\nThis is a good start, but please go all the way or just turn around. \n\nZac was not originally designed as a tank. We can pretend that the original creators wanted him to be a tank, but that would be wrong. The fact that his numbers and abilities were gutted and replaced with low damage, crowd control abilities to make him more in line with actual tanks proves this. His original kit makes no sense on a tank character.\n\nWhy would a tank need to dive a backline? That honestly makes no sense. Why would a tank leave the squishies unprotected, jump over the other opponent's front line, and land in the opponent back line? Doesn't that seem like something a DIVER would do? Dive??? It's no secret that E is Zac's signature ability so why would we change him. Zac is an AP bruiser by design of his abilities. That said there are only two options that will help Zac.\n\nOption 1: Fully revert the Ultimate, and W to their pre rework state.\n\nThe W (unstable matter) should be restored from 15 / 30 / 45 / 60 / 75 to their original 40 / 55 / 70 / 85 / 100. The amount of damage you guys took was crippling for the amount of cc we received. The heavy handed nerfs allow Zac to be invaded by any competent player at level 2 and pop a flash or passive from unhealthy level 2 Zac. This is the largest nerf Riot has done to Zac that has negatively impacted his playstyle. The nerf was completely unwarranted and a kneejerk reaction to his overloaded kit.\n\nThe previous R allowed someone to do almost all of the same things the current R does, it just required more skill. By landing from your E behind or in front of the target, you can knock them 400 units in the direction of your choice. The only difference between the ults is that with the new ult you can take enemies over walls. Unfortunately all it costs was most of Zac's clearing ability, damage, ability to trade, and ability to build ap bruiser. \n\nThe Old Zac pre rework allowed different builds to succeed due to the variety of his kit. The new zac forces everyone to go tank.\n\nOption 2: Keep Post rework Zac\n\nThis new middle ground compromise zac is just a shadow of both of them. The W change is a placebo buff and is a step in the right direction but the actual numbers need to change too. Either keep tank zac, or revert him. A compromise is a sure way to make zac not do enough damage, or make him not be able to tank effectively either. Please revert the W. Please revert the R. Or just leave him be.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Velasan","date":"2019-05-14T20:53:08.433+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"I don't get it.

It is much more unique then the old one and much more interesting. I really don't understand why they wanna change it back to some generic ultimate?  don't care too much about the other changes tho, but the old change seems very out of place. Why make Zac less unique and less strategical instead of focusing on other parts of his kit. I don't see how this change would make him more played or more viable.","replies":[]}]}]}
