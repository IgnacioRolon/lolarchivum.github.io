I quit league for a long time and i recently said **** it, i'm going to try it again. Still had the message. Attempting to reconnect, 3, 2, 1.... But i DID after a lot of searching , find a fix. for anyone else who's having this problem. (Since it seems like a lot of people do now.) **Punkbuster** was conflicting with my League launcher with it running in the background. Go to your task manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc) and make sure _PnkBstr_ AKA **PunkBuste**r isn't running in the background. Terminating it through task manager before i start up league, fixes the launcher completely. Hope this helps someone. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-02T01:51:46.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ayyyyy I'm glad you were able to figure that out! Punkbuster usually doesn't cause any issues since it's meant to close out when you exit the game that was using it, but it seems like it didn't close normally this time. Might be worth checking in the future if this happens again, but if that solution doesn't work in the future give the ol' [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) a college try as well!","replies":[]}]}
