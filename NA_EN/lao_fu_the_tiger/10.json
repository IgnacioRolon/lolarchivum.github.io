These are just my random thoughts.\n\n> A prodigy from the rough streets of Zaun, Ekko manipulates time to spin any situation to his advantage. Using his own invention, the Zero-Drive, he explores the branching possibilities of reality. As well as experimenting with multi-dimensional probability, Ekko spends his days running wild with the other lost children of Zaun. Though he revels in this freedom, when there&#039;s a threat to his friends, he&#039;ll endure anything to defend them. To the unknowing observer, Ekko accomplishes the impossible with ease, time and time again.\n\nI&#039;m not huge into lore, I don&#039;t really keep up with it, and I don&#039;t know a lot of the story. I casually read pages of lore to see how my favourite champion fits into the story, and that&#039;s about it. I would assume the majority of players fall into this category, with a select few who know zero about lore and a select few who keep up with it extensively.\n\n**From an average player, excited to learn the background of a character in which I was genuinely interested, I feel disappointed.**\n\nI&#039;m not hating on Riot. They&#039;ve done great stories, great lore in the past. But this, this is just... sad, almost.\n\nLet me sum up what my thoughts were after the cinematic:\n\n1. Who is Ekko?\n2. What is his story?\n3. Why is he fighting?\n4. Why did the memorial breaking upset him so much?\n5. What&#039;s the story behind his invention?\n\nAllow me to now interpret Ekko&#039;s lore in what we call ** layman&#039;s terms, the simplest  and most straightforward, simple, zero-depth way to explain something.**\n\n> Ekko manipulates time to spin any situation to his advantage.\n\n* He travels in time to turn any situation in his favour.\n\nToo bad this is nearly word-for-word what hte lore says.\n\n> Using his own invention, the Zero-Drive, he explores the branching possibilities of reality. \n\n* He invented the Zero-Drive.\n\nCool. Why? Where did this idea come from? I don&#039;t understand. I thought there&#039;d be more to this device than simply \"kid invented it.\"\n\n> Ekko spends his days running wild with the other lost children of Zaun.\n\n* He plays with his friends.\n\n> Though he revels in this freedom, when there&#039;s a threat to his friends, he&#039;ll endure anything to defend them. \n\n* He exercises basic human decency by helping friends in need.\n* He&#039;d catch a grenade for ya, throw his hand on a blade for ya, and jump in front of a train for ya.\n\nWho cares? Most people would stand up for their friends (unless they have crappy friends).\n\nSo out of what I consider to be the 5 biggest questions that come out of his trailer alone, a whopping 0 were answered. Why not? I don&#039;t understand.\n\nI&#039;m not huge into the debacle between Caitlyn, Vi and Zaun. I enjoy hearing the big picture, but I haven&#039;t done extensive reading into those places, but I can definitely imagine that people who DO invest their time into those cases have a plethora of other questions that, unfortunately, will be unanswered.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2015-05-15T21:34:54.628+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":9,"body":"The paragraph you're seeing there is meant to be a brief summary, not a biography.

I wasn't sure how they did things now. I'm just new into learning champions' backgrounds, and I hadn't really paid attention to how these bios were done since I haven't kept up with recent bios.\n\nBasically, what I'm trying to say is something like this. I love Swain. When I read his little blurb, it doesn't dive into details, and it doesn't really tell a ton about his background. But the blurb is surrounded in mystery and invites you to want to learn more about his person. Ekko's just... doesn't to me.\n\nI dunno. Call me a fool.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2015-05-15T22:06:38.161+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":0,"body":"To kinda expand on what's happening so you're in the know, Roit decided to change their approach to writing and displaying lore, which led to them making these short blurbs, by short blurbs I mean the single paragraph bios like Ekko's here. The intention was for lore to be put on the website and for the client to have this small blurb with a link to more lore on that champion including longer stories and whatever else they have in store.\n\nProblem is the website's broken as shit! Even now you can actually go to the champion pages and visually see where things are broken. They've been working on a fix and are committed to this change since it's been 9 months since these problems reared their ugly heads.\n\nAlso as a HUGE note, if you see \"League of Legends\" actually in a champion's bio, then you're seeing one other problem; with the change in writing and direction they also removed the League of Legends from the universe itself, so the organisation called the Institute of War that ran the League of Legends in the League universe ain't a thing anymore. What you can basically take away from this is the following:\n\n- Everything released from and including Darius to now is totally canon and totally what it's supposed to be.\n- If a champ has lore that has a line like \"and then they went and joined the League\" almost like a footnote at the end, you can remove that line and it should be fine. There might be some changes to these guys in the future but for now it should be ok. A prime example is {{champion:115}}.\n- {{champion:9}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:25}}{{champion:56}}  {{champion:111}} {{champion:61}}{{champion:44}}  are in a weird situation where their lore hasn't been updated for this change, yet they're kinda intrinsically tied to the League even though it doesn't exist, making them exist in a weird limbo. Some of them (Nautilus and Orianna) aren't in as bad a spot because of the nature of their stories, but suffice to say their lore's a bit iffy and you might want to avoid diving in to that for a while if you're get invested in stuff.\n\nSorry for the info dump but from what I gathered from your post I figured getting this stuff out of the way right now would be best. Hopefully this made some kind of sense, if not I'll figure out a better way of putting it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot ShadowStorm","date":"2015-05-17T00:15:23.274+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":45,"body":"> The paragraph you're seeing there is meant to be a brief summary, not a biography.\n\nSharjo, thank's for pointing this out. I really want to highlight this - we've been using these short summaries in the client since Azir. These go out with the champ when they go to PBE, much like other champion game/client assets.\n\nBut we have ALSO released longer-form stories outside of the client, generally around the time of the champion's release:\n\n{{champion:268}} : [Arisen](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/zmvrQ7I6-short-stories-azirarisen) | [Shurima Event Storyline](http://promo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/shurima/story/index.html)\n{{champion:429}} : [Invocation](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/UTTHinkA-short-stories-kalista-invocation) | [The Pledge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnT8jVCyh_E)\n{{champion:421}} : [Scourge of the Desert](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/creative-spotlight/reksai-scourge-desert)\n{{champion:432}} : [Mountain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX8iSobsKTY)\n\nThis also happened with Braum, along with his longer in-client bio: [The Feats of Braum](http://promo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/braum/)\n\nI get that there are mixed feelings on this approach, and differing opinions on how successful these kinds of stories are. Those are fine and valuable discussions to have, and I don't want to downplay those feelings at all.

It wouldn't help if you came in with attitude of smugness, whether you intended it or not.\n\nAnd if Ekko's story is not good?

This seems to happen whenever a Red posts as you'll see something such as a Red participating in a forum game, and then there'll be a thread about it hating on Reds for posting on forum games instead of say, doing lore or fixing that broke ass shit zed, but they don't take a step back and realize that LITERALLY everyone on these forums is a human, and that includes Reds, and sometimes they just want to jump on the forums to relax and they obviously don't work 24/7. This constant negative attitude causes, at least I feel that it would cause, a lot of Reds who want to join in the community but don't because of the backlash it can cause, and that makes me sad. I really wish that people would take a step back, and realize that just because a Red posts on something, doesn't make it THEIR fault or mean that they are not doing their jobs. They are standing at the bottom of the castle with pitchforks, knives, torches, and other weapons, and then they wonder why the Reds won't come down to 'talk' with them.\n\nAs it's been said multiple times in this thread, past actions predict future patterns. That's exactly why the Reds don't post more often, for each time they do on a controversial subject they get constant flak. If you put your hand on a hot stovetop and burned yourself, would you touch it again unless you KNEW it had cooled down?\n\ntl;dr People keep using a pitchfork metaphor, but do you know what the 'put your pitchforks down' statement is regarding? It's a statement referring to mobs and their pitchforks and torches, which means saying that you will put down your pitchforks when stuff gets done is you guys admitting that you are just going along with a mob mentality, and that gets violent, hateful, and lacks logic. So please, for the sake of everyone here, can we actually escape the mob mentality please??\n\nP.S.

Unless someone was _already_ here or read it on one of the many \"Surrender@20\" LoL news sites, they wouldn't know it exists.  The videos you refer to also were more about the Ascension FGU, Sivir and Cassiopeia than Azir, so those don't really apply.\n* Kalista's story, like Azir's story, was released on the boards.  Same rules apply.  The video was just a poor summary of the lore itself and there's a disconnect between the two.\n*  Rek'Sai, iirc, was the only one that people around here praised because it told a _story_ about Rek'Sai (you know, what Narrative is supposed to be doing with these champions?).  \n*  Bard's video tells us _nothing_ about him, other than \"Look, we got the \"Last Airbender\" cartoon people to make us something Studio Ghibli would do!\"  Other than that and some vague answers in an AMA, we get five sentences that translate to _\"Bard has a cosmic, secret past.\"_\n*  Braum's little loading screen event, again, tells nothing that we wouldn't have gotten from his lore.  You might try to spin this around and say \"See, we didn't need any text lore for Braum,\" but it doesn't work.\n\n> I get that there are mixed feelings on this approach, and differing opinions on how successful these kinds of stories are. Those are fine and valuable discussions to have, and **I don't want to downplay those feelings at all.** But the fact remains that while we're only putting short bios in the client, we have still been releasing other story components for the champion.\n\nWhy the hell should one take such a huge priority over the other, to the point where we doubt the existence of Narrative ?  There should be a way for the company to consistently release long champion bios and text stories about the world of Runeterra in addition to their character profile cartoons (Jinx music video) and other marketing tools.  Riot's full of the best, creative minds in the video game industry.  Start putting that creativity towards the lore and not just eSports, skins and live balance.\n \n> Ekko was announced just this week, and has NOT been officially released yet. It is too early to claim that this is all he's getting, so **can we please lower the pitchforks until Ekko actually releases, and THEN assess the quality of his lore?**\n\nRiot ShadowStorm, thank you for putting a name to the condescending, holier-than-thou attitude we've been getting from Narrative over the past three and a half years.\n\nWe'll put the pitchforks away when you, Riot's Narrative department, and the entire company for that matter, start treating us like members of the community you claim to be all about, and not like the gutter trash you occasionally throw a glance to from your high ivory towers when we get a little too loud.\n\nHow about Riot interacts with us in a meaningful way?  How about Riot gets to work fixing their tech issues and getting us the long stories we've been told we would get months ago?  How about Riot treats us like they treat other fans instead of sewer runoff?\n\nSo thank you, once again, for putting a name to all the crap we've been getting from the company for the past 3.5 years.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Matezoide","date":"2015-05-15T21:52:30.270+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":6,"body":"It is never coming.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2015-05-15T22:09:18.619+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":4,"body":"Says you.","replies":[{"poster":"Matezoide","date":"2015-05-15T23:25:23.670+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":3,"body":"It is common sense.

I enjoy hearing the big picture, but I haven&#039;t done extensive reading into those places, but I can definitely imagine that people who DO invest their time into those cases have a plethora of other questions that, unfortunately, will be unanswered.\n\nPar for the course, really.  People are still waiting for some resolution for the Freljord disaster THREE YEARS after the story was first started.  Riot and the Narrative team _claim_ they're working on this stuff, but they shouldn't be believed until they start releasing content.  Even then, the team will be harshly judged on their released stuff and any significant changes to what we already know will be shat upon.  And, they will _deserve_ every single venomous comment and spiteful criticism because of how poorly they've treated us over the past four years.\n\nThen again... that's if Riot isn't already lying to us and really don't care about their lore beyond champion releases and the occasional update.","replies":[]}]}
