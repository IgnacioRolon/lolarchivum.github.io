Especially when it comes to difficult topics such as balance, story, and art. Gameplay and Balance as a Board can open up the door more easily to conversation with this ideology. It's more difficult than it sounds but it provides the best kinds of discussions.\n\nFor example let's take Ahri. PBE buffs or nerfs? Let's set the stage for a second with a hypothetical point, counterpoint:\n\n#Point: \nAhri's current PBE changes make her feel less in-line with her previous play style. She feels less meaningful and more point-and-click [provide supporting data and samples here]\n\n#Counter-point: \nThat being said, her changes power spike her in a way that does compensate for the lack of burst lost from her charm. The power was shifted and not lost. [provide supporting data and samples here]\n\nThe latter are kinds of discussions that our Gameplay and Balance guys would likely really enjoy having.

If me or RavenHusky ever met him irl ohhhhh boy.... the fandom....) but I appreciate your attempt nonetheless.\n\nOut of curiosity, and I know its a topic that Riot is pretty hell-bent against but, in your opinion why aren't there individuals at Riot or specifically a member or two of each department whose job entails: for X hours sit down with your team and the community and try and get out what information the team needs, and give the team what information they need.\n\nI realize that the biggest argument against is Riot doesn't want to force employees to interact with us. They want employees to feel empowered to do so without getting the axe because they promised/said something they shouldnt've. But, on the flip side, the excuse/explanation coming out of every department (Balance, ChampUp, Narrative, etc.) on why they don't communicate more is because balancing work/forums is difficult.\n\nIt would make sense then that if there was somebody who had some dedicated time to this on a weekly basis that the argument of balancing problems (the time ones, not gameplay) would be much dissolved.\n\nSo yeah, thoughts Sweet?

I'll use the recent zed comments as an example. Don't just say Zed is a healthy assassin, tell us why you think he is. Once we know that we can begin to have a constructive conversation about Zed's balance and what is fair to consider reworking. It is a real problem that we don't know why you (Riot) think Zed is a healthy assassin. Does that mean that assassins should excel at everything and outclass every other role? i assume not but that's very much how that comment came off. \n\nNote: Zed has a high pick rate (he is fun to play as) a high ban rate (he is not fun to play against). These show us that Zed's kit is overloaded. On the other hand his low win rate tells us that his kit is undertuned. I don't mean to say that zed is OP when he isn't, just using him as an example of failed discussion. \n\nPersonally i would like to see zed's shadow only be able to be gone to or not, instead of being able to shift back and forth as many times as zed pleases. **POINT** This would mean that when he all ins, he's all in. With that change Zed stops being infuriating to play against because he can no longer towerdive with impunity **COUNTERPOINT** but that is quite an intense nerf so you could buff something else in his kit to compensate his low overall win rate. Is that a fair change? I don't know because i don't know the balance teams priorities. If the balance team thinks its healthy for an assassin to be impossible to catch then that suggestion is not fair, and i should make another suggestion. But if i make that suggestion and get no response i have no idea if it was read and considered, read and dismissed because of the balance teams philosophy on how they need to balance Zed, or if it was even read at all. When we give suggestions like this we need to know if we are in the right ballpark with what is considered ok to touch or not, but we get nothing. \n\nIf the Gameplay and Balance guys would really enjoy having these types of discussions we would really enjoy having them but scrolling through all of last weeks threads i only see a few red comments that actually discuss gameplay and balance in any way. Meanwhile there are just as many non-constructive and overly defensive red posts where they complain about how unhelpful or non-constructive the boards can be. When we see those kinds of posts it's really disheartening because it shows how many reds look down on us when they do read our posts. \n\nProps to GhostCrawler and Meddler for having a positive presence (three constructive posts each) on the gameplay and balance boards in the past week. \n\nIts easy to be dismissive. It's hard to correct the problem. There is room for improvement from both sides of the discussions. \n\ntl;dr \n\nUnfortunately we (the non-riot community) lack context for these conversations because of riots relative silence and or generic statements. \"Zed is a healthy assassin\" is an infuriating thing to read when his balance and design is so obviously overloaded. \n\nWe (the players) can talk all day and give many suggestions, but the discussion has to be two way in order to be a constructive and meaningful discussion.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sweet","date":"2015-02-04T23:25:58.370+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=sixdogman,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gyUaWfuf,comment-id=000c000d,timestamp=2015-02-04T18:33:56.089+0000)\n> \n> tl;dr \n> \n> Unfortunately we (the non-riot community) lack context for these conversations because of riots relative silence and or generic statements. \"Zed is a healthy assassin\" is an infuriating thing to read when his balance and design is so obviously overloaded. \n> \n> We (the players) can talk all day and give many suggestions, but the discussion has to be two way in order to be a constructive and meaningful discussion.\n\nThink this last point is a good one.

One of the tricks I was taught prior to getting into the industry was when you're reaching out to extremely busy people to get feedback (most often managers or subject matter experts who get hit with hundreds of emails or requests daily) providing solutions or suggestions that are thoughtful or provocative are a good starting point. \n\nWhat would you do to Morde to improve him?

The answer to that is multiple. If you were to ask me, I think the idea that he was \"unfair\" is wrong and he should simply be buffed back to his previous state. However, the devs have clearly stated that this goes against their design philosophy. So the options would be either a major rebalancing of his abilities or a total rework à la Sion. In the case of the former, I would double the maximum amount of shield he has, change the decay to be much slower and happen when \"out of combat\", like fury, I would give a strong buff to his W and would change his passive to also increase the damage he does based on the amount of shield he has. This would essentially turn him into a strong tank who forces opponents to target him or suffer the consequences as his shield builds up. In the case of a total rework, I haven't really tought about it, but I'd keep the shield mechanic and the health based aspect of his abilities (we want him to be a master of pain). I would like to keep the pushing aspect of Morde strong. Like, why not make it so when he kills a minion with a certain ability, they return as a \"ghost minion\" on his side which lasts about 30 seconds?\n\nEither way, I think I just broached the issue here, as in why people are getting angry. You can see the different answers I gave but they all rely on knowing what the devs have in mind for the game, their \"design philosophy\". I think much of the frustration from the people posting in the gameplay and balance forums can be summarized as \"We don't know what the ultimate goal is\". There's been efforts to explain what is meant by \"toxic\" or \"anti-fun\" and the such, but there's rarely any \"This is what we're aiming for\" discussions. As an example, a statement which often returns nowadays is \"How can the developers think Zed is okay in his current state?\" What makes them think Zed is okay? What makes them think the other champions are also okay? If they're not okay, what are their plans to remedy that? Etc.\n\nBasically, to give constructive and useful feedback, we need certain information. Information which many feel is being denied to us.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GigglingAngel","date":"2015-02-04T06:04:47.479+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Sweet,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gyUaWfuf,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2015-02-04T05:39:34.011+0000)\n>\n> A good way to attract conversation from our teams and from the community is to make discussions that have points and counter-points.

She feels less meaningful and more point-and-click [provide supporting data and samples here]\n> \n> #Counter-point: \n> That being said, her changes power spike her in a way that does compensate for the lack of burst lost from her charm.

Yes, we want change to some things, but they also do take time. And I don't feel like people are patient enough.\n\nAn example is Ahri (in her current live state). People complained and complained and complained about the fact that Ahri was \"gutted.\" They complained that Ahri was getting Olaf'd, and that Ahri was no longer going to be any good, and that the move speed buff was worthless. Plenty of hate-filled threads were made about tearing apart their favourite champion.\n\nOne week passes.\n\n\"Ahri is OP.\" \"Nerf Ahri, but do it X way.\" \"Her Q is overloaded. Tone it down; it's too powerful.\" \n\nIt's proof that the community operates largely on assumption with little to no evidence. And these threads are **perfectly** okay in my book as long as they openly state they are expressing their initial thoughts based solely on reading, and that they simply aren't sure yet, rather than \"F U RIOT YOU KILLED AHRI\" before she was even released, only to QQ about her later.\n\n**td;lr: It's not so much about the content of the post.

Because it hasn't gone anywhere in years.  There are some really serious problems with the game in its current state, most of which I think can be filed under confused direction by the company in whole (by each of its parts).  And like OP points out each time a thread gains traction it dies off.  And like others have stated, real threads with real concerns and good points almost always go unnoticed.  How do we communicate with you guys directly?\n\nPersonally, I feel like my biggest concern that has gone unaddressed for a while now is the ranked system.  I know you guys have professionals, statisticians, an entire team based around balancing, etc, etc, but from the outside looking in the entire system makes 0 sense mathematically.  None.  The entire system is based on playing a large amount of games and how you perform over said large amount of games.  It has nothing to do with your skill level or ranking, though the two aren't mutually exclusive.  I know I don't get to see the data you guys have (I've asked for it numerous times just so I could understand), but as a guy with a phd in mathematics the system is totally unfair towards the player.  Even if you sit back as a layman and just *think* about the system, it makes no sense.  At the end of the day the forums gave up on trying to make you guys (Riot) understand the problems that were seen because Riot ultimately said \"we can't think of a better system\" and \"shut up\" over and over again.  \n\nDo you know how frustrating it is to see all this?  And I know you want us to shoot you solutions - I don't have one.  Ex Riot employee after ex Riot employee has hinted at the fact that there is some agenda you all live by, and as a company you should have one, but the context has always been that you guys have a direction and we're ultimately just being dragged along with it.  I know you can only do so much on the communication and data collection front, but I swear to you some of these problems could probably be solved in less than a day if the problems were just acknowledged.\n\nAnyway, not coming to this thread mad with fist in air, I'm just starting to become disconnected from the game after so many years.  I love the game, I love the playstyle, I love each and every one of you community members and Rioters, even those of you who flame me for 40 minutes for misplacing a ward in the bush, but I just feel like I'm losing touch with Riot.  I guess what I thought this game could be isn't what everyone else wants it to be.\n\nJonathan","replies":[]},{"poster":"Baculus","date":"2015-02-04T15:59:21.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"No, the discussion method doesn't work.

Yup.\n\nI completely disagree, and feel you're missing the point of the thread entirely.\n\nDiscussion does work. In fact, it's the ONLY think that works. And the proof is, ironically, within those \"hate threads.\" Is Riot responding to the original poster of the thread? Not usually at all. The responses are to those who express civility in their posts. The comments are directed towards different people who took the thread and composed it better. Their posts may be in opposition to something that has been changed, but at least they are acting like adults when they express their complaints rather than children. \n\nBusinesses listen to \"raging, angry consumers,\" but they typically never submit to their demands; being angry and raging is a state of irrationality in which people speak from emotion more than logic. Before you disagree, I'm not saying their anger isn't founded in logic, and I'm not saying that they cannot be logical at the same time. However, somebody who wants to speak and influence another party must not only be logical, but composed and open to reasoning rather than maintain a rigid stance. This has nothing to do with butt-kissing; it's a fact that people are more willing to talk and listen (and even concede they're wrong) when the disagreement is displayed in a calm, rational manner. In short, a **discussion should always feel safe, without the fear of any party flying off the handle at a moment's notice.** \n\nThere is absolutely no need to reward civility. Do you get rewarded by the government for being a \"decent citizen?\" No. Did you get rewarded by the teacher for not talking in class? No. It is expected. But you will certainly get punished in those circumstances for acting in an uncivil manner. Likewise, on the forums, you won't get rewarded for being a decent human being. You will, however, be disappointed in the concrete response you get from Riot in the form of game changes if all you do is rage, no matter how backed up you are by the community. That is, at least until somebody from the community makes a post that  actually discusses the problems in a proper manner.\n\nI won't acknowledge the servers comment, since Riot just released a thread regarding the ongoing status of those changes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Alorasence","date":"2015-02-04T22:12:24.258+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot responds to intensity and passion, both positive and negative, more so than passivity.
