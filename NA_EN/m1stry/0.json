Breaking the rules doesnt make you a villain... the world isnt that simple. Yes calling for reports is considered toxic. When would you ever need someone else to report, when you could just do it yourself? Its an attempt to single someone out and get people in the game to single that person out. What if you did nothing wrong, but every game is filled with people telling everyone to report you? League would kinda suck after a while, wouldn't it? So its against the rules. Remember, 1 report has the same effect as 9. There is never a reason to ask for others to report for you. And there are no stipulations in the rules that allow you to break the rules (like if they said the N word, now youre allowed to ask for reports... thats not the case. You need to start reporting on your own, not asking others to report). Its sad tthat Riot does such a poor job of explaining this shit to players.

The problem here isn't that you got to their desk for a manual review because of multiple reports in a particular match. The problem here is that anything innately close to being 'Negative' behavior can get you punished and that you did have stuff in your logs which they could label as being 'Negative'. \n\nRiot's policy is just how it is. Next time, mute and report. If you can't deal with it and feel like you're about to pop a vein without flaming or arguing back, just get off the game and take a break.

There is no responsibility to be taken, this system was set to snowflake level, and now anything you say will get you punished. But don't worry you'll get punished too, I guarantee it, everyone single person will. Because they expect for people to never get mad, or be completely mute, neither will happen in this game. So keep thinking you're \"good\". It'll be all the more funny when you get banned for it.\n\nI've been playing since 2011 and - like most players - have never been punished. You, on the other hand, have just gotten your second punishment and you're not even level 30 yet. If you don't behave according to these \"snowflake level\" rules, whether you like them or not, you'll eventually be permabanned.","replies":[{"poster":"M1stry","date":"2020-01-27T08:13:04.672+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"You have?

If you're looking in my match history and you can't see any record that I've played before S10, try scrolling down. I'm not sure how I would even get to 88 without having played in any prior season when it only started less than a month ago.\n\nEven with my gameplay fragmented across multiple accounts, this one has gotten to 88 while yours has accrued two punishments by 28.\n\nFor the last time, either change your behavior or you'll eventually be one of the tiny fraction of a percent of the playerbase that manages to get permabanned. It's up to you. I don't have anymore time to waste on this conversation, so I bid you goodbye.","replies":[{"poster":"NF Remilia","date":"2020-01-27T15:09:56.017+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to tell you since i see you are new player .

My main is only level 118 and im having it since season 1 so its perfectly normal for him to be low level and playing from season 1. I as him , have few accounts so im not playing only on my main.

I've seen multiple times where someone was only \"somewhat\" negative like above and get instant feedback simply because we all agreed to report them.\n\nI've also seen homophobic and racially motivated slurs go unpunished because only one person reports.\n\n\n\nThe fact is, riot cant say \"Your 1x report matters just as much\" and \"if your reports are flagged as false, they have less of an effect\" at the same time. It simply doesn't make sense AT ALL.\n\nThe fact is, riot doesn't care about actually carrying out a good system - they only care about appearing that a system helps people make their feelers feel better - it gives a tool to toxic kids to report players, and doesn't punish real toxicity - like trolling and soft inting.\n\nThe truth is, the system is broke but they don't want to spend money on human review, so they just role with it and flash ESPORTS everywhere and damn any sense of negativity in the public eye.","replies":[]}]}
