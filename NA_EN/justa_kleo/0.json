Implying a Jewish person doesn't have a soul is discriminatory, insulting, and hateful. Whether you meant it that way or not is, ultimately, not enough to grant an exception to the rule.","replies":[{"poster":"JustA kleo","date":"2019-10-22T02:37:28.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"so bottom line... youre totally fine with me using a 2nd account to basically bypass a permaban, which you wont revert even tho i never meant any harm?","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-10-22T02:39:11.025+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JustA kleo,realm=EUW,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=x5Mt5EjF,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2019-10-22T02:37:28.847+0000)so bottom line... youre totally fine with me using a 2nd account to basically bypass a permaban, which you wont revert even tho i never meant any harm?\n\nWe do not typically mass ban accounts save in extreme circumstances.

I do 100% agree that even the suggestion that certain groups of people don't have souls to possibly explain some in-game phenomenon should be removed from Boards, but that's a far cry from stating such as an individual belief. It's possible that the former stems not from horrible, horrible racism, but rather from a dearth of social self-awareness arising in part from cultural differences between NA and Europe. Outside of certain European countries where a statement of racial inferiority is actually illegal outside of an explicitly educational setting, it might be recognized as distinct from a personal expression of hatred.
