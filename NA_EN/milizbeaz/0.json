But useless. I checked Firewall, AntiVir, Graphic Drivers, Net Framework, i deinstalled and installed the Game twice. Nothing worked. Now im very sad :/ and dont know what to try else. Some of my friends can still Play. So this is not a Problem that matters to all.\nAh and by the way im EU West. I will try NA maybe this helps. BUT PLS RIOT FIX YOUR SERVER/CLIENT PROBS!\n\nUpdate: I tried NA Server and it worked.

Since you've already taken some general troubleshooting steps, that helps narrow things down a bit for me! \n\nIt doesn't look like you've tried updating your port forwarding settings or DNS server settings, so check out this [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for how you can do that and let me know how it goes.","replies":[]}]}
