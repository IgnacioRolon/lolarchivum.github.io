Is your game installing directly to your internal primary drive, or an external storage?  An external storage would only temporary download updates, so it would requires redownloading every time it restarts.  My recommendation in this case would be to download the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and try a force repatch to wipe any bad files, repair them, and get new files.\n\nIf the issue persists, run through our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide as well in case anything beyond running as admin might be blocking your files from saving.
