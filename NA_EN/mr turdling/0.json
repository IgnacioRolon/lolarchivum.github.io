I waited... waited... waited... and was not reconnecting. So I exited the game. Got back in, was at the home screen. Did the game really end that quickly? I was gone maybe 3-4 minutes. It is possible, but I don't think so. I check my match history. There isn't anything there. I log out, and log back into my account... still no record of this game occurring. Just checked again, and there's no record of this game happening.\r\n\r\nWhat is the deal? Why did this happen? Anyone else ever experience this? I'm a little irritated, because I was having fun in that game.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-11T22:35:19.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"More than likely what you experienced was a game crashing on the server itself. It doesn't really happen all that often, but when it does, everyone is booted from the game and won't get any penalties for it either. You should all have been able to requeue again as if the game never happened!","replies":[]}]}
