They may have a basic framework for him such as lore and abilities but the artistry and creation of the model is a lengthy and drawn out process (excuse my pun). They have specific animators and artists working just on him but it is still a process that takes time and serious consideration on their part to make him the way they want him while also trying to keep us happy and not go too far off from that. I would recommend listening to that podcast because it was very insightful and helped me at least to understand how Riot goes about these reworks. It was from League Community Podcast on Soundcloud.
