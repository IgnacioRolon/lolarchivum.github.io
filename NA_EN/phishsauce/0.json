WELL GUESS WHAT GUYS IT ISN'T. client starts it back over from the beginning. like what is the RIOT league of legends company even doing?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-08T03:00:19.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue you described is actually usually tied to a poor connection to our servers.
