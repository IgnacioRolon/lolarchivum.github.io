Personally my mine grip is how skins are distributed based on popularity instead of who needs a new one most. Eg, lee sin has had 1-2 skins every year, since his release in 2011. Yorrick hasn't had a single skin in those 4 years despite there being many great ideas for alternate fantasies. He literally hasen't had a single skin since he came out that wasn't there on release. Just because a champ is unpopular both with the player base and with riot (Based on whats been said about him) doesn't mean they should just be left to rot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2015-05-14T11:51:34.350+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't known who came up with that backwards logic, but it kinda reminds me of the balance department.\n\nSure some alternate skins are nice too, but those obvious skin are great exactly because they are  obvious.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Penta Penguin","date":"2015-05-14T23:51:33.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But you'll still keep them on sale instead of having integrity","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-05-14T01:46:55.901+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"In that case, when are we going to get a Vi skin where she wears giant hex-tech boots and kicks people to death?","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2015-05-14T06:42:47.208+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":12,"body":"If we felt that was the coolest idea for a Vi skin, sure why not.
