Let&#039;s see if we can attract a few more Rioters to this forum.\r\n\r\nSo, who is your favorite champion, storywise? And why?\r\n\r\nPersonally, my favorite is Quinn (and Valor). Her story is absolutely amazing -- she is a highly ranked soldier in a place where your caste determines everything. Her very existence is probably a cause of conflict among Demacian nobles. (I have a headcanon where the only reason why Quinn was allowed to do what she does today is that Prince Jarvan IV created a new position just for her, so she could continue to serve Demacia to the best of her abilities.) Plus, I like the concept between having a giant bird of prey as a companion.\r\n\r\nQuinn also has interesting connections to Talon. They have remarkably similar fashion senses, and she seems familiar with his assassination style. I can&#039;t tell whether I want them to have a sibling-friendly-rivalry or romantic relationship, though. I can&#039;t go further with any headcanons about that until I decide which one seems like a better fit. (Riot please at least tell me if Talon is Caleb!)","replies":[{"poster":"Celindrea","date":"2015-05-20T11:01:07.413+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riven. I highly enjoy the fact that she forced herself to wield giant swords just to prove how goddamn Noxian she was, and determined she was to stay that way up until her final battle in the Noxian military. The moral conflict at that point is also something I find really interesting. Yes, she did slaughter countless Ionians, but she believed it be for a just cause, the Noxian cause: that they were simply stronger than they were and that's just how it goes. And yeah, it wasn't until her own troops started to drop like flies did she realize that this whole thing just was not working out for her. (granted her league judgement does state that she and her men didn't particularly want to dispatch civilians, they were just kind of ordered to, but still) Also I dig the whole, \"I'm gonna ditch my past ideals and since my sword is the symbol of those past ideals, I'mma break it!\" thing.\n\nYasuo's lore I like because apparently he was a prideful prick about his mastery over the wind technique of his school and that later came to bite him in the ass when no one even tried to defend him when accused of murdering the Elder.

Specifically, there are two lines from her judgment that really cemented this for me. As she's fighting through the ambush:\n\n> The Ionians had the advantage, but Riven wasn’t one to surrender. If they could defeat her in combat, they deserved this victory. The strong *would* prevail.\n\nThis to me is the \"pure\" Noxian value to which Riven holds. The strong will survive, whoever that turns out to be. I like that Riven goes into battle with that mindset, and knows that she may someday find that she isn't the strongest.\n\nBut then, the Zaun death machines open fire:\n\n> *Only the strong survive*, she repeated… but that was meaningless here. Nobody would survive. By all rights, the Ionians should have won this fight, but they too would die. How did this follow the Noxian way?\n\nTo me, this is when she realizes that Noxus - her Noxus - is broken, so she shatters her sword to match it. But I like to think that she keeps the fragments with her. I think she believes that while Noxus is broken, that it doesn't have to be.

If you were to tell her story from the beginning, with out knowing she becomes the opposite of what she is, you might not guess she would become the Scorn of the Moon. But, events take her down that path. \n\n(SPOILER ALERT) \n+\nLike in Lost, you see Jack on the island, but when you see his flashback he's like \"THERE IS NO WAY I'M GOING TO AUSTRALIA TO GET MY FATHER.\" And yet you know he's on the island, so he goes to Australia and gets on Flight 815, but at that point you're like, \"Oh man, how's he gonna get there, he is so vehemently opposed to it right now. But he has to be there eventually cause he ends up on the island.\" \n\n  \nShe was a Solari and something along the way changed her so much, that now she's filled with such anger towards them. I really like what I believe Iron Stylus said on a story post about her from when she came out. \"What's more tragic than having to kill something you love.\" Or, something along those lines. I think it's really cool and interesting to know they had a relationship where Diana probably looked up to Leona and loved her. I don't really ship them, but more of like a sibling style love. And then to feel so betrayed that now Leona's her worst enemy. Even if Leona was away, or had no idea it was happening, and Diana still feels betrayed.  I think that is a really interesting thing to explore. \n\nI'd really love to see her journey from inquisitive Solari who feels connected to the moon. and tries to change the minds of the Solarian Elders,  to her current self. I think the relationship between her and Leona would be great to explore and see how that changes. And, how she becomes so deadly with her Moon Scythe Sword thing. The whole story of her I think is awesome, and I sympathize a ton with her.  It brings to mind The Dark Knight quote, \"You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\" or whatever. I feel like she totally believes she is in the right, but is going about it in maybe the wrong way. But I love her  for it. \n\nAlso, honorable mention to Jinx/Vi. (Again with the Batman references I guess.) I like to think of the obvious similarities between Jinx and the Joker, and how that relates to Vi.

I feel like a lot of it is reduced to her identity as Jinx's rival after Jinx was released, and the \"canon\" lesbian in the League (that is still sexualized to some extent - like the boobs on her Officer skin and her skintight Neon Strike skin - but I think Debonair is a step in a better direction, though I've had enough of the community calling her a dyke and reducing her character to just that.)\n> \n> Big kudos to Riot and Gypsylord for creating a character I genuinely care about and identify with, in a way I haven't felt about a fictional character in a long while. As a girl growing up loving games and presented with strong male archetypes as protagonists, Vi is a breath of fresh air and the depth of her character feels empowering. I do play a lot of Leona, Sejuani, Soraka, Diana, etc. but Vi is someone I can relate to - you can be female and punch faces in, you can be strong, and you can be smart, even if it's not the kind of \"smart\" that society would normally think of.\n> \n> I didn't really get \"into\" the game until Debonair Vi came out (that's when I decided to say \"fuck it\" and drop my money on getting Vi and her skin, back when my account was level 10-15 or so), and since then I've been playing her top and jungle until my account was 30, and only then I've branched out and tried other champions (because I kept getting beaten in lane as toplane Vi lol). I don't play her as much anymore, and thanks to Mata's incredible showing at last year's Worlds I've taken a shining to the support role, but Vi continues to be my #1 favorite champ.\n> \n> Once again thank you Riot and thank you Gypsy for making such an awesome character :D\n\nVi used to smoke??????\n\nBut I completely agree with you, I think {{champion:254}} is one of the most awesome characters ever made in fiction, her back story is interesting and mysterious, she is a complete blast to play, and her personality and sense of humor are awesome.  I mean, she puts the PUN in PUNch for crying out loud!  Also she's left-handed, which is both rare for video game characters and extremely awesome!  And its also cool how she goes through all that turmoil in her past and still wants to do good (Of course, as long as it involves punching bad people in the face, but still).\n\nYes, it is a shame when she is written off or reduced for the reasons you mentioned.  When I first saw {{champion:254}} , I didn't think she was a lesbian (just incredibly punk rock).  I was just blown away by her overall design: she was both jarring and awesome to look at.  But the more i saw her interactions with {{champion:51}}  just made me realize how adorable of a couple they would make, if not a little bit comedic as well XD.  But it's whatever, the fact is that people are going to speculate or write characters off based on things people think ( poor {{champion:44}} is an example). Vi is awesome regardless of her sexuality.\n\nI could go on saying how awesome she is, but it would basically be a rehash of what you already said, so you already beat me to the PUNch! (sorry -_-)\n\nWhat especially amazes and interests me about her lore is the \"VI\" tattoo or brand under her left eye.  GypsyLord said that she had it for as long as she can remember, and that it actually is the roman numeral for 6, and that her name Vi comes from it, not the other way around.  \n\nThis then begs the question: Who would tattoo or brand a large number onto an extremely young child's face, where everyone can see it, and why?  \n\nWas she a slave?  Was she a biological experiment of some kind?  Is it related to that gear tattoo or brand on her neck?  And of course it said she was orphaned, how?  And why is she out on the streets in the first place?  Was she abandoned there or did she escape something?  And is she actually more from piltover, or zaun?  And she apparently has a sister, is she by blood or bond or some other common factor they both share?  Maybe related to the tattoos?  Maybe to the numbers?...wait we do know a champ who signs her names with an X (or a 10 in roman numerals, if it is in fact, a roman numeral)...{{champion:222}} ?  Maybe...maybe not\n\n And we know that {{champion:51}}  was looking for a criminal who left a card with the letter C on it, which could either be the roman numeral for 100, or just, you know, the letter...\n\nAnd will whomever put that number on her face in the first place eventually be revealed as a new champion?  Will they look at Vi and say  \"Hello number 6, we missed you!\"?\n\nIs this building to anything?  It could be cool :D\n\nSo I also want to shout out to GypsyLord for making one of the most awesome characters in fiction ever!  You are awesome, and so is Vi!!!!!\nAnd sorry, this turned out longer than I thought it would be -_-","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Voidac","date":"2015-05-21T20:44:23.081+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:127}}. She's like the only one who has her shit together. She has a plan and she has all the time in the world to make sure it's done right. She's patient, years spent getting everything ready for the eventual return of the Frozen Watchers. And even if they don't return, she's amassed  enough power to definitely do some damage. \n\nUp next is {{champion:112}} who was hurt so bad (emotionally) that be began replacing his own body with his inventions. Now no one can steal his creations.\n\n{{champion:115}} tried to hard to impress those he respected and looked up to, only to result in them looking down on him. Even still, he came to their aid. He CHOSE to save them, even after everything that's happened. True hero, this one.\n\n{{champion:110}} Varus, man... Poor guy. Seriously... these kinds of decisions are hard to make and either way you're screwed. \n\n{{champion:63}} Brand isn't evil. He's wildfire. He wants to cleanse this world of the corruption of humanity and science to make way for a new world. And in the words of Parthurnax, \"Who are we to stop the birth of the new world?\". Brand is that force, a force of nature (or a creation during the rune wars) that seeks to stop the destruction of the world my cleansing it with fire. Seriously, google \"wildfire and plant life diversity\". It's the same concept.\n\n{{champion:134}} Holding her back was like pulling back a rubber band. Something's gonna snap. When she learned what they were doing to her, it didn't sit too well with her. \n\nJust some of my favorites simply because of their lore. Lore defines a champion, gives them purpose.

He was a man that had his life's work stolen from him simply because of the greed of another. He fell into depression, and was no longer able to face the world. But even then he wanted to make the world a better place. So he did what he did best: He built something. Something that could remove the sadness and anger that was consuming him, something that could ensure nobody had to suffer ever again. \n \nBut emotion clouded his judgement. He couldn't remove his sadness, anger, and resentment. He simply transformed it. And this transformation consumed him more literally than emotion ever could. This transformation became his obsession. And in his obsession he came to a realization that would change everything. Humans are broken. Not just emotionally, not just physically, everything about their existence is flawed. And what does an engineer do with flaws? He fixes them.
