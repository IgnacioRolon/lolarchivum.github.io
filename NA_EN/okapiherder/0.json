Also doesnt LoL have one of the largest player bases in the world? i get that the new update isnt global yet but still, there should be more than enough players to test out the new champ selection without completely getting rid of a perfectly functioning game mode. \n\ni would love to give feed back about the new champ selection, but i cant give honest feed back if im going to be biased before the match even begins. with all the trolls and toxic players i got put with i cant give honest feed back while knowing team builder was perfect. as someone who only plays team builder i liked it because i didnt have to deal with toxic players as much and with team builder it more about have fun rather than being super competitive. blind/draft/ranked all have way more competitive players and way more toxic ones as well.\n\ncombining team builder and blind isn't a good solution either i think. that would still be combining two different player bases that dont interact well with each other since team builder is more about fun,learning champs, and an over all better atmosphere. blind has a much more competitive/toxic player base (and again im fine with players wanting to be competitive but i just dont want to deal with being yelled at while im just trying to enjoy a game). \n\ni personally think that riot just doesn't understand that different communities in LoL play different game modes. draft/rank: players who are competitive and enjoy climbing the ranks. blind: new players (who usually are bombarded my toxic players since they dont know how to play yet), competitive players who are not ready for draft/rank yet, some casual players, players who fill for fun. team builder: more casual players, players who are just looking to have fun, able to play with friend very easily, some players only like playing one role/champ ,learn new champs while still able to be in a pvp environment (i know people say just play custom games or play vs AI, but its not to same to learn new champs against AI)\n\nno matter what i think Riot might have jumped the gun here a bit with this new update, i think the new champ selection has a lot of potential and will be great in the long run for draft/ranked. but i think both blind and team builder have their place in LoL for a reason and if the end goal to to combine the two then i think it will just cause more headache than cheer for the community","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2016-01-18T21:20:03.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because the new champ select takes the stuff they like from team builder (less toxicity from people not getting the role they want, the ability to have more time to talk about comp) while removing the stuff they hate (long queue times, mainly.)\n\nI'm not saying they succeeded, but that was their logic.","replies":[{"poster":"11Kyuss11","date":"2016-01-18T21:21:59.956+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hellioning,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=E0GBfoa1,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-01-18T21:20:03.982+0000)\n>\n> Because the new champ select takes the stuff they like from team builder (less toxicity from people not getting the role they want, the ability to have more time to talk about comp) while removing the stuff they hate (long queue times, mainly.)\n> \n> I'm not saying they succeeded, but that was their logic.\n\nExcept the new champ select doesn't allow me to get the role I want...I have to choose between two roles.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2016-01-18T21:29:46.288+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because of the queue times; old team builder had an issue with queue times, especially during off-peak hours or for really high or low MMR brackets.\n\nRequiring two roles instead of just one is their way of lowering these queue times.","replies":[{"poster":"BestTristMyHaus","date":"2016-01-19T17:44:04.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hellioning,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=E0GBfoa1,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2016-01-18T21:29:46.288+0000)\n>\n> Because of the queue times; old team builder had an issue with queue times, especially during off-peak hours or for really high or low MMR brackets.\n\nNumerous people have asked for \"ignore secondary choice, I'll TAKE the longer queue time\" but we don't have that option.  I get the deal with it, and I'm actually OK with playing a secondary role.  The problem I have had (so far) with the new queue is it seems like I ONLY get the secondary role (slight exaggeration, I get my primary a FEW times).  But if they don't have some system in place to insure you DO get your primary with some worthwhile level of frequency, then giving me the \"choice\" of two roles that's going to mostly force my secondary because my primary is \"too popular\" kind of sucks and just frustrates me MORE.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2016-01-19T23:22:47.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A) It doesn't just raise queue times for that particular person, it raises queue times in general.

For the entire time in which she's been a League of Legends player. It's nice because she's good at what she does, but it sucks because queueing with her means nobody gets to play ADC.\nI think a key element to being a worthwhile player, is being able to play with diversity. It's much better than playing ranked or draft and being last pick, calling your role when you load into lobby but hearing \"lol no its pick order.\"\nAnd then next thing you know you're stuck in a role you know little to nothing about, and getting chewed apart in game by your entire team for feeding or losing lane, when _they were the ones who forced you into that role in the first place._\nThis way, although there have been reported issues of people just ignoring their assigned role (but rarely), all five people on the team are able to compromise fairly. \n\nTeam Builder matchmaking was also a bit unfair.\nWhen new to a champion -- we'll use a first-time Draven for example -- Team Builder would say that you'll be matchmade against an ADC that's also new to that champion; yet I couldn't count on all my fingers and toes how many times I'd load into a game with my duo while he is first time with a specific carry and I am first time with a specific support, and we get stuck laning against a Mastery 5 Vayne and a Mastery 5 Sona. What??? Matchmaking adjustment is supposed to go away once you're Mastery 4 with that champion. Why are us first-timers being matched against players who are avid in that role with that champion?

It was originally intended to be moved to ranked but it seems they never got around to it, and now we know why.\n\nThey see the new draft as an extension of this project, that it takes what they learned from team builder and applies it to a ranked scenario while still allowing the players some room to maneuver if their pick gets banned. But remember that one of team builders biggest draw backs was its relatively high queue times, further splitting the community would likely ensure that their effort would be a failure because of the increased wait. So they nipped the problem in the bud by limiting your queue options to ensure that the new draft would have a big enough player base to offset its increased discrimination in creating random groups.\n\nBasically the new draft attempts to do everything that team builder was supposed to, and hopefully will do it better. This makes team builder not only irrelevant but also a hindrance as splitting people among different discriminative queues will only increase the wait times on both. Admittedly this is a problem for someone that only wishes to play a single champion, but heres hoping that the queue works well enough that you will usually be given your preferred choice.\n\nHow well they succeeded at this is anyone's guess right now, there probably wont be a definitive answer for a couple of weeks at least as the kinds are worked out of the system, but I think that is the reasoning behind it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Andrionar","date":"2016-01-19T10:13:56.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"They removed Team Builder, becouse it wasn't popular enought.","replies":[]}]}
