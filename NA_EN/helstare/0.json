As NoxianPyime mentioned, you can only get 1 chest per champion per season. If you've already gotten a chest with Illaoi this season, you won't get another from playing her regardless of your mastery score with her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NoxianPrime","date":"2017-09-24T04:39:10.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I think the way it works is you can only earn 1 chest per champion per season, so if you've already earned a chest on a champion, you wont get another one whenever you get an S.\n\nThe way you check if you've gotten a chest on a specific champion is by going to your champion collection, hovering over said champion, and it should say \"Chest Acquired\" under how many points you have on that champ. if you haven't gotten the chest yet it wont say anything. There should also be a thicker box around the champions you've gotten chests on.","replies":[]}]}
