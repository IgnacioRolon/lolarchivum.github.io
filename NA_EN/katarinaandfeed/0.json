This may change in the future but the reasoning behind this is that we'd rather leave it to the players imagination to create whatever rivalries and alliances they choose (such as that awesome Dark Star Thresh / SG Janna art).\n\nProgram being sentient AI that have wrestled control over a city from their human creators is pretty much on the money. I imagined Lissandra as more of a hive-mind queen, controlling everything from behind the scenes.
