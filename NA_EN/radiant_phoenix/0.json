Then after killing league 2-3 times via task manager i manage to connect waaay too late into the game (from minute 1 - 4) \r\nIm not sure when this started but probably since ive been using the new client, as i said..not sure though. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have a solution to this? It doesent happen every game but it still annoy's me alot, especially in ranked. \r\n\r\n\r\nPS: it would be nice to know that im not alone with this problem","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-24T16:50:45.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can still run into issues reaching specific servers even if your internet is good,  For your specific issue, it sounds like your network is having problems transitioning from champion select to the game server.
