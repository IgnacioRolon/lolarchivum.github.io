[Guide]","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"People ask on these forums all the time about how to build a PC, and what components they need to buy. The purpose of this thread is for people to get both the confidence and the knowledge to get your first custom up and running. Tonight I am going to write on how to select components, and later I will edit to add a proper guide on actually have to assemble your computer.\n\n*If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.*\n\nOkay let's first look at what we need to have for a proper PC, and what they do. We need the following:\n>CPU\nGPU\nRAM\nStorage\nPSU\nMotherboard\nHousing/case\nCooling\n\n**First up we have Central Processing Unit (CPU). You can think of the CPU as the main brain of PC. It performs instructions and calculations. Some common terms for a CPU are:**\n\n* Frequency. A frequency at which it runs at. An example would be 4.0GHz. This number is really only useful when comparing same exact types of CPUs. In typical settings your frequency is your Front Side Bus multiplied by your CPU's Multiplier\n* L1, L2, L3, cache. This is best to be thought of as very fast short term memory for the CPU. A high amount of this allows you to perform larger sets of instructions.\n* Cores. You can think of a core as roads for your CPU. With more cores you will be able to multitask better.\n* Threads. Threads are essentially additional lanes for your cores. It doesn't directly effect your CPU's possessing power, but it allows for more data to be sent to your cores.\n* Die process. You want this to be as low as possible. The Die process in which the CPU was created with represents the size of each transistor in your CPU. The smaller the Die process, the less Power and Heat is produced.\n* Unlocked. An unlocked CPU indicates that the CPU's Multiplier can be freely adjusted. This makes Overclocking a breeze and is recommended to have for any gaming CPU.\n* Cooler. If you are going to be gaming, the stock cooler with your CPU is simply not going to cut it. More will be explained later in this thread.\n\nNow you have two brands to consider for your CPU. You have Intel and AMD, and they take massively different approaches to how their CPU's are made.\n\n* Intel tends to use fewer Cores and use additional threads. They also use smaller Die processes and have very straight forward designs, allowing them to be consistently strong across the board. A downside to Intel is that not all of their CPUs are unlocked, and unlocked CPUs will charge you a premium. You will want to use Intel if you have the budget to spend more than $200 on a CPU.\n* AMD decides to work harder and not smarter. They feature more cores, higher clock speeds, and higher Die processes. Since most games and programs do not use more than a few cores, most of AMD CPUs are not fully utilized. AMD CPUs are typically the best bang for the buck in the &lt;$200 range.\n\nHere are some gaming CPUs I recommend (All of the following are unlocked):\n\n* Intel Core Haswell i5-4690K ($239.99) - This Quad Core CPU is considered to be the ideal gaming CPU. If your budget allows for this CPU, it will not let you down. You can expect this CPU to run all games at maximum settings without any issue. If you are buying a PC for gaming, this is the best CPU you can get without massively overpaying for incremental improvements.\n* AMD Vishera FX-8320E ($134.99) - This Octa Core CPU packs a large amount of raw power at a very low price. Rendering, Streaming, and Intense multitasking would be some reasons you would want this CPU. Some games may struggle with this CPU due to not utilizing all 8 cores. With a typical OC you should expect to be able to run most current games at maximum settings.\n* Intel Pentium Haswell G3258 ($69.99) Anniversary Edition - This Dual Core CPU is ideal if you are strapped for cash. You should expect to run a good amount of games at higher settings. Games like LoL, Dota, and CS: GO will have no problem running at max with this CPU.\n\n**Now that the CPU is out of the way, we are now going to talk about the most important component for a gaming PC. The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). The GPU is responsible for all the visuals that get sent to your display and you want to spend at least twice as much on the GPU as you do the CPU. Common GPU terms are:**\n\n* Core and Memory speed. Like the CPU clock speed, this should only be used to compare the same types of GPUs. When selecting a GPU this is not really important.\n* Memory bus width. This is very important if you want to play games at highest settings or at high resolutions. Once again you can think of this as additional lanes for data to flow to, and from your GPU. A bus width of 384-bit or higher is overkill if you are playing at 1080P with a single monitor.\n* Video Memory. This is short term memory for your GPU. If you are playing on a single monitor at 1080P, anything higher than 2GB is not really needed.\n* Cooler. Unlike CPUs, a specific type of GPU (such as a GTX 760) can come in many different styles and coolers. A higher quality cooler will allow your GPU to have a slight increase in performance, provide a longer lifespan, and keeps it cool. Reference coolers indicate that it is coming with the stock designed cooler, which is usually not that effective... attempt to stay away from these.\n\nHere are some gaming GPUs I would recommend:\n\n* GIGABYTE GV-N970WF3OC-4GD ($349.99) - Based off of the new Nvidia GTX 970, this card will dominate any game at 1080P with a great price.\n* Sapphire Vapor-X 100362VXSR ($299.99) - This card is based off of the AMD R9-290, it provides a massive amount of Video Memory and Bus Width. This card is ideal for someone who wants to play at Quad HD (2560x1440) or wants to play with Multiple monitors without having to spend over $500.\n* MSI GTX 980 GAMING ($579.99) - Based off of the 970's big brother, the 980, this is the fastest card on the market currently. Only get this is you will be playing at Quad HD or 4k Resolutions.\n* EVGA SuperClocked 02G-P4-2765-KR ($209.99) - This GTX 760 will allow you to play almost all games at 1080P with maximum settings. \n* EVGA 02G-P4-3753-KR ($139.99) - This 750ti card sips power and will be able to play most non intensive games at maximum settings at 1080P. If you strictly stick to LoL or Source games, this would be a great card for you.\n\n**RAM stores what your computer currently has open, so the CPU can access it again quickly. I am not going to spend too much time with RAM, as it long as you follow these simple guidelines you will be fine:**\n\n* Only buy RAM from reputable brands such as Corsair, Crucial, Gskill, and Team.\n* 1600MHz and 1866MHz RAM is usually the best for the price, buying any higher would most likely provide you no performance increase.\n* 8Gb is enough currently, you can spring for 16Gb if you have the cash.\n* All DDR3 RAM will be compatible with modern DDR3 motherboards.\n\n**By building a custom PC, you will be able to get a proper storage setup that will make booting and general computer use lightning fast. First let me explain the two types of common storage devices:**\n\n* Mechanical Hard Drive/Hard Drive Disk (HDD). Almost every computer since the beginning of time has one of these. They are essentially based off very old technology and are very cheap for what you get. They are slow and very reliable, however they provide you with a large amount of space for storage. \n* Solid State Drive (SDD). Most high end modern computers has one of these in them. They are smaller, use less power, are lightning fast, reliable, and impact resistant. **Getting a Solid State Drive will provide one of the largest performance gains for general computer use.** If you spend any more than $850 on your build, you should ensure you have one of these. The only downside these these wonders are that they are expensive and do not provide much storage.\n\nSo HDDs provide bulk storage, and SSDs provide quick and reliable speed, so how can you get the benefit of an SSD without spending a small fortune on one? It's simple:\n\nMost people will buy a smaller SSD (around 120Gb for $100) and buy a HHD for bulk storage (1Tb for $60). This allows the user to Install Windows and frequently used programs and data on the SSD, and save things like Music and Pictures on your HDD.\n\nFor the SSD I highly recommend a Samsung 840 Evo (120Gb version for $100). It provides features that other SSDs do not have such as on the fly AES 128-bit encryption, Ram caching, and good read and write speeds.\n\nFor the HDD I typically pick up a Western Digital Caviar Blue (1Tb Version for $60). They are simple and great HDDs. I tend to go with them because their RMA process is quick and easy if the drive ever fails.\n\n**Power Supply Units (PSUs) are often overlooked when it comes to decided on what to get. Getting a quality PSU is extremely important, as this component has the ability to fry everything if it fails. Some terms for PSU are:**\n\n* Wattage. Most people tend to believe that Wattage is the only thing that matters when it comes to a PSU, but that is not the case. Having a PSU with enough watts is a good starting point, but it is not the only factore.\n* 80PLUS rating. This certification represents how efficient this PSU is at optimal stress. The typical ratings go from 80PLUS (~80% efficiency), 80PLUS Bronze (~82% efficiency), 80PLUS Silver (~85% efficiency), 80PLUS Gold (~87% efficiency), 80PLUS Platinum (~89% efficiency), and 80PLUS Titanium (~90% efficiency). A high efficiency rating will require your PC to draw less power from the wall, and gives you a good insight into if that PSU is using quality components.\n* Modular. I highly recommend getting a Semi-Modular or Fully-Modular PSU for your build. It basically allows you to only use wires that are needed, and you won't have a Hentai tentacle monster with thousands of wires cramming up your build. It will make it easier to assemble and makes your PC look much nicer on the inside.\n* Rails and outputs. If you are using a single GPU, it is best to have a strong single rail. By having more weaker rails you risk having the one that is powering your GPU overload and fail. You also want to ensure your PSU will have the proper outputs for your GPU. Consult here for more information, as I am not the best at explaining this: http://www.newegg.com/product/CategoryIntelligenceArticle.aspx?articleId=199\n* Brands. This is very important. Only buy Corsair, Seasonic, XFX, Raidmax, Coolermaster or other reputable brands. **STAY AWAY FROM APEVIA, XTREMEGEAR, THERMALTAKE, CYBERPOWER, and iBUYPOWER PSUs.**\n\n**Motherboards connect everything you have together and communicates all of your components. While a good Motherboard won't improve performance typically, it is very important for compatibility, overclocking, reliability, and features. Common terms are:**\n\n* Socket. Your CPU and Motherboard must consist of the same socket. Ensure you get this correct.\n* Platform. The platform at which your Motherboard uses defines what features that comes standard with it. For the typical user this will not make a huge difference.\n* VRMs and VRM Cooling. Regardless if you are planning to Overclock, ensure that the Motherboard you are considering has adequate Voltage Regulator Modules and that they are cooled properly. Having a poor Motherboard in this fashion can potentially cause your CPU to downclock and impact performance and reliability.\n* PCI Express Slots. Any modern Motherboard will at least provide one PCI Express x16 (Gen2 or Gen3) slot for a GPU. If you are planning on running multiple Graphic cards, ensure you at least have two PCI Express slots running at 8x (for Gen2/AMD) or 4x (for Gen3/Intel). Just because your Motherboard may have multiple \"PCI Express x16 slots for SLI/Crossfire\", it doesn't mean that it is running at that speed.\n\n**Choosing a case is one of the best parts of building your own PC, but ensure your case has the following:**\n\n* Proper Intake and Exhausts with Dust Filters\n* Is compatible with your Motherboard, CPU cooler, and Graphics card size (Newegg will have physical specifications in the details tab)\n* Has proper cable management features, for your sanity's sake.\n\n**CPU cooling is important, the typical stock cooler you get with your CPU is garbage and should be replaced. You have 3 types of CPU coolers:**\n\n* Air. Very basic and very effective. These coolers are cheap and are typically pretty large. A great Air Cooler would be the Cooler Master Hyper 212-Evo/Plus. Some Air Coolers will be easy to install, and some will be difficult.\n* Closed Loop. This is a prepackaged Liquid Cooler. They provide great performance, but are usually costly and need to be replaced within a couple years. Most are very easy to install.\n* Custom Liquid Cooling. If this is your first build, do not even think about it.\n\n**Example Builds:**\n\n~$600 Budget build for LoL and other non intensive games\n>http://pcpartpicker.com/p/7M9gCJ\n* Intel Pentium G3258 3.2GHz Dual-Core Processor\n* Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO 82.9 CFM Sleeve Bearing CPU Cooler\n* ASRock H97M PRO4 Micro ATX LGA1150 Motherboard \n* Team Vulcan 8GB (2 x 4GB) DDR3-1600 Memory\n* Western Digital Caviar Blue 1TB 3.5\" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive\n* Asus GeForce GTX 750 Ti 2GB Video Card\n* Rosewill R5 (Black) ATX Mid Tower Case\n* Corsair CX 500W 80+ Bronze Certified Semi-Modular ATX Power Supply\n\n~$1000 AMD Build for Streaming and Quad HD gaming\n>http://pcpartpicker.com/p/VzQkbv\n* AMD FX-8320E 3.2GHz 8-Core Processor\n* Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO 82.9 CFM Sleeve Bearing CPU Cooler\n* Asus M5A99FX PRO R2.0 ATX AM3+ Motherboard\n* Team Vulcan 8GB (2 x 4GB) DDR3-1600 Memory\n* Samsung 840 EVO 120GB 2.5\" Solid State Drive\n* Western Digital Caviar Blue 1TB 3.5\" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive\n* Asus Radeon R9 290 4GB DirectCU II Video Card\n* Fractal Design Define R4 (Titanium Grey) ATX Mid Tower Case\n* Corsair CSM 650W 80+ Gold Certified Semi-Modular ATX Power Supply\n\n~$1200 Ideal Gaming Build, Max any game at 1920x1080 with 100+FPS\n>http://pcpartpicker.com/p/xyYsvK\n* Intel Core i5-4690K 3.5GHz Quad-Core Processor\n* Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO 82.9 CFM Sleeve Bearing CPU Cooler\n* Asus Z87-Pro ATX LGA1150 Motherboard\n* Team Vulcan 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR3-1600 Memory\n* Samsung 840 EVO 120GB 2.5\" Solid State Drive\n* Western Digital Caviar Blue 1TB 3.5\" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive\n* Asus GeForce GTX 970 4GB STRIX Video Card\n* Fractal Design Define R4 (Titanium Grey) ATX Mid Tower Case\n* Corsair CSM 650W 80+ Gold Certified Semi-Modular ATX Power Supply\n\n~$2000 Overkill 4K Gaming/Rendering build\n>http://pcpartpicker.com/p/VYvrwP\n* Intel Core i7-5820K 3.3GHz 6-Core Processor\n* Corsair H80i 77.0 CFM Liquid CPU Cooler\n* Asus X99-DELUXE ATX LGA2011-3 Motherboard\n* G.Skill Value 16GB (4 x 4GB) DDR4-2133 Memory\n* Asus GeForce GTX 980 4GB Video Card\n* Fractal Design Define R4 w/Window (Black Pearl) ATX Mid Tower Case\n* Corsair CSM 750W 80+ Gold Certified Semi-Modular ATX Power Supply\n\n~$1500 My build (Not cost efficient anymore)\n>http://pcpartpicker.com/p/TzJKNG\n* AMD FX-8350 4.0GHz 8-Core Processor\n* Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO 82.9 CFM Sleeve Bearing CPU Cooler\n* Gigabyte GA-990FXA-UD3 ATX AM3+ Motherboard\n* Team Vulcan 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR3-1600 Memory\n* Samsung 840 EVO 120GB 2.5\" Solid State Drive\n* Western Digital Caviar Blue 1TB 3.5\" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive\n* Asus Radeon R9 290X 4GB Video Card\n* Corsair 600T White Graphite ATX Mid Tower Case\n* Corsair CX 750W 80+ Bronze Certified Semi-Modular ATX Power Supply\n* Asus VG248QE 144Hz 24.0\" Monitor","replies":[{"poster":"Five man ganked","date":"2014-10-27T09:09:18.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]}]}
