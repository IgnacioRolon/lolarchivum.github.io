It is an SDK to add effects or rending technologies to \"optimize\" for Nvidia based GPUs, without having to properly add effects themselves like HBAO+. If this technology worked as Nvidia intended, it would only strangle AMD cards into resulting into poor performance. \r\n\r\nThe reality however, is in their effort to cheat their way out of producing better products (Like Intel and their compiler)... they actually fuck everybody over. There has not been a single Nvidia Gameworks game to date that has performed properly.  Just look at AW compared to Ghosts, the game runs on the same engine, but one is Gameworks enabled and one is not. Can you guess which one?\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/gHSO9qP.png\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/QOxbSjf.png\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/2VWii0x.png\r\n\r\nPlease do not buy Gameworks enabled games, as it is poor practice for both GPU manufacturers and Game Developers.","replies":[]}
