I may play Akali if she's not banned, and AP trist if I feel Annie would be a poor choice.\r\n\r\nI don't know why, but Annie stomps ridiculously hard in low plat... kinda weird since she has no mobility. I pretty much always go Mejais since they buffed it. If you have having trouble climbing in the low ranks, you should give Annie a try.\r\n\r\nMy typical general build:\r\n{{item:1056}} {{item:3041}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3102}} \r\n\r\nI'll also play with who ever, as long as you rank is not low enough to mess up my LP gains.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/lol_iseestars","replies":[]}
