Let&#039;s face It, this new splash is awesome. It looks practically the same as old Evelynn you know and ~~love~~ hate, but at the same time it solves all the existing problems she has. She&#039;s attractive, she actually wears some clothing, spikes on her leggings look like something she can actually use now and this art shows a lot more character. She also has this cool neck-chest armor-like thingy. And overall she looks very new and shiny while still being 100% recognizable as the same Evelynn from the League of Legends beta.\n\nRiot, you shouldn&#039;t be missing out on this opportunity and make this splash her Visual Update. When the time comes, just remake her ingame model so it fits the new splash art - and here&#039;s your VU right there. Don&#039;t make this great work go to waste!\n\nTL;DR New splash fixes all Evelynn&#039;s problems and it should be her VU.\n\nhttps://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cqp4Kwkuyds/Vw6QJOvIo7I/AAAAAAAA500/Tkwtl57Ek_QxEetrHOvKa8_CK05ips1rQCLcB/s1600/Evelynn_Splash_0.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"bloodmoth","date":"2016-04-14T12:44:39.413+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey, came here to support this! thanks for the invite.\n\nits just really hard to actually imagine them making anything better than this, and that isnt to say that they lack the capability, its just that this absolutely nails what the character is, was and should be all in one go!\n\nIts sexy, its vicious, its sadistic, its elegant..\nThis is all from a concept that was basically mystique in bondage, this artist managed to take one of the laziest designed champs and produce something truly unique out of it! This splash alone makes me want to make evelynn one of my mains!\n\nHeck, Im the kind of guy that finds sexualized female characters to be embarrassing, i generally cant stand the token ... slut (ie Ivy from soul calibur, though there was always voldo to balance it out) But i find myself drawn to this image!\n\nIts... perfect! Its exactly what it should be, its context, style and everything is just spot on\nYeah shes sexy, her body language conveys that, but its all a means to an end and you can see the intent on her face, where her mask has been removed and now she is relishing in the kill.\n\nHer original splash seemed completely random from skin tone, hair style, fashion sense, streamers, studs, symbol on her head, color scheme etc, and till now i didnt really consider any of it worth preserving, but this seems to harmonize it all into some cohesive theme, and after seeing this picture i cant imagine evelynn without anything she has here, from her hate spikes, streamers, the symbol, her talons, the contextless blue skin, the wild hair style, all those random cues make perfect sense in this picture somehow.\n\nAnd its not enough that this actually looks good now, its completely unique, she has her silhouette, you could recognize this evelynn from a shadowed line up of all of leagues other champs fairly quickly, main draws being the talons, the streamers, the hair and the thornlike spikes\n\nBeautiful like a rose, sexy as hell and vicious as a cornered honey badger\n\nWell done","replies":[{"poster":"mirAcIe","date":"2016-04-15T09:39:13.192+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thanks for the support.

It feels strange to be so enthuiastic about this splash because I'd rather not be associated with one of *those* people who is weirdly obsessive with sexualisation as a concept but it is so hard to envision Evelynn being better than this. The second I found out there was a mysterious female assassin in League who ran around invisible to sneak up on people, I wanted to play her. Unfortunately her splash and model being hideous and not at all threatening completely ruined the fantasy and on top of that, her kit was pretty disappointing for it. Pretty crappy VO too.\n\nGive her a completely new voiceover, remake her model to match her new splash and update her kit to push her more towards being an assassin and less towards being a weird tanky bruiser thing.
