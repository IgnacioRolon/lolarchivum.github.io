It's pretty obnoxious because you enter and leave stealth way too often and sometimes you're in stealth \"just because\", not because you want to ambush someone, so you don't need that kind of reminder 24/7. The detection circle is enough.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nameless Voice","date":"2016-11-09T20:03:25.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just came here to post the same thing.\n\nFirst thing I do in the preseason patch is to check how Evelynn is at jungling now.\nTurns out, the jungling isn't as much a problem as the fact that I can't see a thing in this tinted world.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xyzoom","date":"2016-11-09T19:17:04.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"smoke yellow-pink screen :) \n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brutalitops01","date":"2016-11-09T15:20:32.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stealth glow?

It happens way too often on Evelynn and it doesn't feel good to run around with pink glasses on all the time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OrcrO","date":"2016-11-10T04:21:23.121+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"What a bunch of incompetent fucks.
