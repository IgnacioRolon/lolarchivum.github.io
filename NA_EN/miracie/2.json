Buy Magus + CDR shoes, get 40% CDR, hit 4 people with R, 2 people with Q, one champion twice with E, and you get an reset within 1! second. Or if you assasinate a single target: Hit R, Q, E, Q, Q and you still get the reset within 3 seconds.\n\nAnd you do even more damage with CDR shoes than with Sorcerer shoes: CDR shoes increase the Q-DPS by 25% while Sorcerer shoes increase the DPS by just 12% against a target with 42 MR. E does physical damage and R can't kill anything anyway. But you can lower the CD.","replies":[{"poster":"Vermonster","date":"2015-03-31T00:47:17.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You get the reset anyways if you kill something.

I mean if you think about it, 30% movement speed for 3 seconds is like moving 90% of the distance you move in 1 second, so with boots and rank 1 W you just move 328 units more than you would have. For a comparison, Graves/Lucian dash are 425 units (and near instant) and Ezreal is 475. Rivens is 325, and is also pretty instant. Obviously her W gets much better the later the game goes, but it is really really horrible early on, mostly useful for the slow removal. With the passive movement speed on it, it was a much more relevant skill for the entirety of the game instead of just post level 13 when the skill would actually get more than a single point in it.\n\nEven with 40% cdr the skill is like impossible to reset, either you or the enemy are already dead by that point, and after the 3 seconds when your W wears off, you are pretty immobile until it comes back. Especially since you usually have to  use it to even get in range since you don't get the passive movement speed to begin with, meaning you can't even cleanse slows with it... it's just overall extremely hindering of her to not have the passive movement speed stack. It's unbearable","replies":[]},{"poster":"mirAcIe","date":"2015-03-30T17:48:40.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Widder88,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xjzEYUKi,comment-id=000300010000,timestamp=2015-03-30T16:48:23.168+0000)\n>\n> Your build is good.

The trade off that we got with that change is simply not even close. Old W >>>> New W, that's all we're saying. The amount of spells you have to land to get your W to reset in the mid game almost equals the amount you'd normally land to kill someone anyway (and you'd get your reset regardless of the new W mechanic). Capping out at 40% cdr in the midgame is not an optimal build tbh. There are a lot of other concerns and it doesn't change the biggest issue with this change which is:\n\nNow you *might* get a reset before getting an assist or might not, but you still lose out on all the MS that you could use to potentially outplay your enemies. It's just straight up worse and we simply don't understand how in the world someone decided she deserved a nerf.","replies":[{"poster":"Widder88","date":"2015-03-30T19:25:21.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=mirAcIe,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xjzEYUKi,comment-id=0003000100000000,timestamp=2015-03-30T17:48:40.559+0000)\n>\n> I don't know why do you keep ignoring my points and still want answers, I think I made it pretty clear.

As long as your W active is active it is reduced to 11 due to soft caps. When W active timed out, 16 flat ms was nice, but not really strong compared to the active. 30% ms means 95 flat ms.

You need just R, Q, E, Q, Q. Its  easy to do within 3 seconds. If your target is already dead after this, you have done your job.

I don't know about you, but a lot of people used that to their advantage when positioning yourself in combat to dodge stuff etc etc. It was your field to play with, now it's gone. You have another field to play with (trying to get a faster reset on your W), but you can do it by killing people as well.
