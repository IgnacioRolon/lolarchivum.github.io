A good Yorick is like a good Nasus.

His R lasts for 10s. When you take into consideration that his ghouls last about 4ish seconds on average if not being AoE'd down, which usually means they have to save their AoE's for just his ghouls, he'll still sustain 2-3 ghouls in a team fight until his Revenant (Or the person the ghost is of) dies. \n\nEach ghoul also has 35% of his max health and 35% of his max AD. This means they do a lot of his damage and still manage to sustain a large amount of health while also taking 50% less from AoE abilities. \n\nPretty much.

Can't remember the name of it now. Didn't have a clue how to play him but realized he was something so I bought him and learned him. I am not a super great player but from my opinion he is not OP and not really underpowered either. \n\nIn most of the games now you deal with super assassins that gap close and jump away, and every other non assassin champ that has mobility and range. They can shoot down the minions from distance, they can just jump away. With the low move speed he has trouble even trying to close with most popular champs despite the slow minion. the q speed boost does no good when he can't get in range to get a hit for the speed boost in the first place. But if you get a champ that doesn't have that range and mobility then he can do great. \n\nHis biggest problem that I see is that he is designed for past seasons and is countered by too many new champs or old champs with mobility reworks. If his q granted the speed boost on activate, then I think that would put him in a decent spot vs newer champs. Maybe make his minions start hitting when they spawned instead of sitting there. The other downside is that he needs the tear first, giving other champs an earlier power boost, and that to spam the spells needed for the manamune upgrade, he just doesn't have enough mana to keep it up. So you get the choice between getting damage or mana early, with the former meaning that you take longer to get tear stacked up which is pretty much mandatory. That would be okay if he was powerful enough to take the hit to early game dominance that other champs get. But it's entirely situational on the enemy team how good he can be right now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AetherKingdom","date":"2015-04-21T03:14:55.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yorick doesnt need buffs","replies":[]},{"poster":"Space Bum","date":"2015-04-21T03:02:44.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Want to fix Yorik?
