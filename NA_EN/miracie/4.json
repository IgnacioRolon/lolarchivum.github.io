This meta heavily favor's her because the number of targets she can hunt down ranges anywhere from 3-5 when it should only be 2-3 that makes a huge difference because until she get's voidstaff she won't be doing much damage to a tank and there are plenty of champions you can pick that hard counter her as well, some of those champions aren't meta because the other champions pushed them out. \n\n{{champion:25}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:5}} \n\nAll of these champions either have an ability that hard counter's her W, or are better duelists early and can simply invade her to make her lose out on her level 6 power spike, i'v been hard punished by Lee Sin's quite often to the point where i wasn't 6 until 10-12 minutes into the game, usually i'm level 6 at 8 minutes in, delaying my time to be a good jungler by a lot, lowering my gold income by taking my camps, and getting themselves fed off of me because i can't do anything about them, it requires a lot of teamwork to stop invades as Evelynn, she can't duel them at all.\n\nAlternatively any champion that can build Edge of Night, Banshee's Veil and Mercurial Scimitar has ample counterplay to her as well, all three of those items hard counter her W and increase your MR forcing her to go Void Staff earlier than usual. And, to top it all off she also does horribly against tanks and simply grouping by mid to late game forces her into a possition where she literally can't do anything without sacrificing herself aswell.

(and even if there is someone closer it passes trough and can still hit)\n\nCharm is a point and click, not a skillshot. On top of this, it prioritizes the first target hit with Q so minion blocking is very effective.\nSecond, who the hell stays stilll when charmed? The main reason she isnt olayed by pros is because grouping up screws her assassination ability.\n\n\n> 1.5 seconds is still quite quick.\n> Only doing 1 spike and 2 other ability or basic attack hits still deals  240 + **135**% + (45 +30%) per Q hit\n\nThat is because herE is max hp based and deals a low amount of flat danage. It is why Q is maxed forst because it allows her to kill swuidhes where as her E is more for tanky targets and late game scaling.\n\nShe is like talon, at level 3, she only has 2 damaging abilities. The damage is necessary, and because it is skillshot based it is full of counter play.\n\n\n> Note that we are not really talking about the death ball fights, where everybody get&#x27;s one shot, but rather a gank situation in which she can get her 1.5 seconds (which is of course horribly delayed burst) off.","replies":[{"poster":"Rouwhorst","date":"2018-08-15T20:30:22.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was referring to the Q which is a skillshot.\nThe spikes prioritize champions over minions so standing in a minion wave doesn't help not getting charmed.\n\nTechnically nobody stays still when charmed, they move towards the charmer.\nMoving... sure but so does eve, invisible, possibly from an angle, with larger Q range than detection range.\n\nShe has her W which reduces magic resist so it sort of does damage.\nSkillshot based, sure but only the first part.

The burst, even before these recent patches is capable of occurring in much less.\nHell in one second, an adc can shoot you in the face 2.5 times, or 5 times in the time it takes to charge the charm.\nChampions such as lissa dra, yasuo, zed, ahri, any other damage based champ would destroy her while she stands there for 2.5s while it charges.\n\n\n\n> This is bad because W is supposed to be a huge part of counterplay vs Evelynn that makes the perma invis design less frustrating. \n\nNo it isnt.\nHe huge counterplay is the lack of a gao closer, and her camo range being at its biggest yet, bigger than her pre rework state.\n\nThe counterplay is her charm oointing at her location for you.\n\nHer counterplay is having weak early ganks and a 2.5s charge time on her cc.\n\n>Some of this might be due to the inflation of damage from Runes (esp electro/harvest) so after these changes go through Riot should see how she settles.\n\nThis is a significant factor.\n\n> If after that she still remains a problem they should look into making her W more mandatory in order to recieve a kill (after a certain amount of MPen {{item:3020}} {{item:3916}} W basically has no impact on the amount of damage you deal and the ability for Eve to kill.

Again, if her W became mandatory it would be bad. 2.5s charge time is an eternity. For example, try to duel any adc while waiting for your charm to charge..or mage. Or anothwr assassin for that matter.\n\nBest counterplay to any assassin is proper team play. It is why dhe doesnt see alot of use in proplay if at all. She punishes people running around solo.\n\n\n> \n> {{champion:157}} Yasuo is just frustrating and needs sweeping changes.
