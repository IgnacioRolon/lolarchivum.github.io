The final day to receive them is the 23rd.\n\n> Due to the nature of this particular gift and the way it varies by account, we’re not able to simultaneously grant it to everyone. This means it may take a few days for the gift to show on your account. We’re asking for a bit of patience through next week as we pick up all the stragglers—if you don’t have it by 9/23, let Player Support know. Additionally, players using the alpha League client may receive the gift but not a notice—double-check your account before opening a ticket. \n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/riot-games/announcements/thank-you","replies":[]}]}
