{"poster":"KellenGrace","date":"2015-03-09T01:58:09.149+0000","title":"Let's Talk Succubus","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":24,"down_votes":10,"body":"So here's the thing. Eve is problematic because of her ability (if she's not nerfed into the ground at the moment) dominate gank-heavy jungle style by virtue of her capability to circumvent wards entirely, making it very difficult to anticipate her ganks.\nAs a result, in her current state, she is inherently unbalanceable (barring gimmicky weirdness like the new ward idea). That means Evelynn isn't allowed to play. Riot has always alternately allowed her to be a thing, in which case she's nigh unstoppable, or simply removed her from the game. So I have a proposition for you guys.\nWhat if she didn't have permanent stealth anymore?\nNow, I know, y'all are gonna say \"it's central to her playstyle,\" and \"without it, Evelynn's not Evelynn.” That's fine, but I disagree. Here's why.\nThe strength of Evelynn's ganks is dramatically enhanced by their ability to simply drop out of nowhere with her permanent stealth. However, the core of it comes from her w, the ability to pursue or escape nearly instantaneously. As a result, I would like to see her run alternatively, and in a way Riot can balance without modeling certain counterplay styles uniquely to address her.\nIn this rework, I’ve changed her passive to “Torment,” gaining further consistency with her central theme as a violent seductress. Torment provides an effective method by which her abilities can gain increased power and crowd control effects, but must be used with careful consideration to maximize their potential. With the addition of the Torment effect on Dark Frenzy, Evelynn retains the element of surprise, so long as she plans and position’s carefully. Additionally, if she uses the mobility afforded by Dark Frenzy’s passive effect, which now provides her with up to 45% movement speed entering the fight, which decays throughout the time she spends in combat, she can even potentially utilize the invisibility afforded by Dark Frenzy’s Torment effect to escape a fight that isn’t going her way. She even regains her previous ability to actually drop some hard cc on a target with Ravage’s new effect. Because she is now so capable of dashing into a fight unnoticed, her ultimate now builds on her central theme of the diabolic tormentor, draining the strength from her opponents to augment her own, and making her a terrible destructive force for a short period of time.\nAnother thing to note is that Evelynn is now required to decide whether or not she wants to initiate a fight, or wait to maximize the strength of her combat prowess. Like the cunning seductress she is, she must choose precisely the right time to strike at the weakest point. If she is ready to do it, the results are terrifying.\nShe also has lost the mana generation ability of her passive, so I have raised her mana regen slightly, and lowered the cost of Hate Spike. Additionally, she is now squishier, emphasizing the importance of striking the opponents’ vulnerabilities above all else, rather than simply being able to dash in and sustain a prolonged duel.\n\nWith these changes, Evelynn retains her core identity, she adds versatility and calculation to her playstyle, and her bag of tricks gains some marked uniqueness, beyond simply “semi-invisible halfass tank assassin.” Or “she who must always be nerfed.”\nSo here’s the actual meat and potatoes, folks. I hope you like this as much as I liked trying to put it together!\n\nArmor: 32.5-100.7\nMagic Resist: 22.5-76.5\nHealth: 492-1932\nMana: 285-1257\nMana Regen: 9.1-19.6\n\nPASSIVE:\nTorment: After not damaging or being damaged by another champion for six seconds, Evelynn gains one charge of Torment every 15 seconds (Affected by CDR). She also gains one stack of Torment on kill or assist. Evelynn can store 2/3/4 charges of Torment. Torment gives a special effect to each of Evelynn's abilities.\n\nQ: Hate Spike: RANGE: 500 COST: 8 / 13 / 18 / 23 / 28 MANA COOLDOWN: 1, Missile Speed Decay removed.\nACTIVE: Evelynn fires a line of spikes through a nearby enemy, dealing 50 / 70 / 90 / 110 / 130 (+25 / 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 % AP) (+20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 % bonus AD) magic damage to all enemy units in its path. A charge of Torment is used the first time this ability hits an enemy champion, slowing all targets hit by 25/30/35/40/45% Max Health for 2 seconds and dealing 10/15/20/25/30(+3/6/9/12/15% AP)(+4/8/12/16/20% AD) additional Magic Damage. A charge of Torment cannot be used with Hate Spike on the same target more than once per 6 seconds.\n\nW: Dark Frenzy: COOLDOWN: 16 seconds\nPASSIVE: (Range 1200) Evelynn gains a percentage bonus to speed when moving towards targets with less than 50% health for every 6 seconds she is out of combat. decays 1 stack per 3 seconds in combat. This effect stacks up to 3 times, and one stack is gained with each autoattack on a champion.\nFLAT MOVEMENT SPEED PER STACK: 5 / 10 / 15 / 20 / 25\nACTIVE: Evelynn removes all slows affecting her, gains 50/60/70/80/90% increased movement speed for 8 seconds and ignores unit collision. Champion kills and assists refresh Dark Frenzy's cooldown. A charge of Torment causes Evelynn to become invisible for the duration of the ability, until another ability is used or Evelynn deals damage to a target. If used in combat, this effect takes 1 second to activate (delayed up to 3 seconds when taking damage).\n\nE: Ravage: RANGE: 175 COST: 40 / 45 / 50 / 55 / 70 MANA COOLDOWN: 9\nACTIVE: Evelynn slashes a target twice, dealing 40 / 60 / 80 / 100 / 120 (+ 60% AP) (+ 70% bonus AD) magic damage and gaining 10/15/20/25/30(+.5% AP) health per hit. Evelynn then gains 60 / 75 / 90 / 105 / 120% bonus attack speed for 3 seconds. A charge of Torment causes the target to be stunned for .2/.4/.6/.8/1 seconds.\n\nR: Dark Sacrament: COST: 100 Mana RANGE: 175 COOLDOWN: 120 / 90 / 60\nEvelynn gains a bonus 50% tenacity for up to 6 seconds or until the ability is activated again. Activating this ability a second time causes Evelynn to cling to a target, channeling and suppressing the target for 1 second. Following this, Evelynn deals 50/100/150 damage(+80% AP) to the target, and gains that much health. For 2 seconds after the suppress ends, Evelynn is immune to CC, the target's AD, and AP are lowered by 20/25/30%, and Evelynn gains a bonus equal to the amount of each attribute lowered in this way. This persists for 4 seconds. A charge of Torment empowers Dark Sacrament, increasing the amount drained to 30/35/40% and adding 2 seconds to the length of the effect.\n\nObviously, the numbers would likely need to be tweaked in PBE. However, I truly believe that this would resolve many of the reasons Evelynn has been problematic in the past. I would love to see her returned to legitimate play, and I don't want to wait for Riot to come up with the proper gimmicks to make that possible.\nSo what do you guys think? Let me know in the comments! I really want to hear your opinions.","replies":[{"poster":"BerserkInferno","date":"2015-03-09T03:46:30.324+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"She's not a seductress. She's never been.

I also feel that a name change for her passive would be appropriate, but that's a trifling detail. The mechanic itself is pretty solid. What if she got stacks of her passive for champ kills? That way she wouldn't fall off so much once team fights started.\n\nI'm not denying that she is a sensual character, I'm just trying to say that it's not the crux of her theme or personality. (like it would be for a succubus) Unlike ahri, who is actively trying to be seductive, evelynn is merely comfortable and confident in who she is and isn't afraid to flaunt it. Therefore it adds to her sensual nature without being overbearing nor the core focus.\n\nTo put it simply, she's the type of person that if found naked, wouldn't bat an eye and proceed to eviscerate you, while someone like ahri would probably pause for a moment and strike a seductive pose to throw you off guard.\n\nEDIT: also, I haven't read eve's bio in years.

She doesn't have the majority of characterizations of one. If we're talking about modern Eve, she's from the shadow isles. {{champion:82}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:60}}  are all demons. So it makes sense that she would be a demon as well, Succubus.\n\nTalking about Launch Eve, she has always been about BDSM. Her outfit was intended as Scarizard has said on the Forum Archives. Succubi and Incubi (btw we should get one in this game) are always about getting pleasure from others' pleasure or others' pain. That is exactly what Eve's Lore and quotes refer back to.\n\n\"Your pain is my pleasure.\"\n\"I like when they scream.\"\n\"I got the touch.\"\n\nEven the names of her skillset focuses on the succubus nature. \"Agony's Embrace\". \"Ravage\".

I definitely see this as an opportunity for riot's lore team to expand upon their universe when they rework eve by giving vampirism a stronger place in their world as well as fleshing out just who/what eve is.\n\nAlso, just because eve is allied/aligned with the shadow isles does not necessitate that she originated there. Considering her half vampirism, she could be some form of Zaun experimentation. (if I'm not mistaken, I believe she was originally from Zaun before the shadow isle event)\n\nAlso, just because succubi are demons does not inherently mean they are about pain and suffering. Some succubi act much like ahri did in her lore and merely entice their prey to suck them dry.\n\nAs I mentioned elsewhere, one of eve's core themes is that of a predator.

I don't see why you feel the need to insult me, particularly considering that I'm attempting to actually move her back to viability, rather than continue to try to make her permanent stealth \"work,\" something that has never ever been effective, and results in her being continually rendered \"Evelynn status,\" something so much a tradition that it's become a term in its own right.\nPlease pay attention to the modifications I've made to her ult, which gives her an identity beyond simply \"AOE kindaslow with a crappy shield.\" She's not viable as she is, and she never will be, even if Riot makes some kind of odd ward specifically to address her.\nI really don't see why you feel the need to be so hostile about this. I've mained Eve since the beginning, and I really want to see her realize her potential, move back to an assassin, a force to be reckoned with, rather than the joke she constantly becomes because it's so difficult to balance the permanent stealth. She needs to be changed, and I'm proposing a way to do it. She's never ever going back to release Evelynn because release Evelynn is not viable by Riot's own admission. She'll always be what she is now, with brief periods of her returning to effectiveness before being inevitably nerfed again unless we *do something*, so I'm trying to, because I love her and I miss her being effective.

This proposed kit relies on *momentum*, rather than the common and low strategy \"nuke\" tactic. She's there to debilitate and hunt, relying on the concept of *pain,* rather than simply blowing someone up.

This is dangerous in modern League, with all kinds of mobility and peel to make sure you can't get to and stick to your target. Slows are not going to be enough, and the 1 second stun can only do so much. Without outright giving her a gapcloser, she's going to get kited and killed often.\nThen again, you really can't load her down with a lot of stuns or snares either. Imagine how frustrating it would be to have her appear from stealth and chain CC you in place for three seconds. She'd gank better than a {{champion:111}} at that point.\n\nA possible solution could be to give her some kind of MS boost to chase down a target that Eve has marked in some way. Similar to {{champion:77}} in that once she picks a target she can just run them down. Possibly even gaining some tenacity if within some distance. However, unlike Udyr, she can't use that mobility to escape, only chase after.\n\nAnother solution could be a silence. Silence prevents a lot of enemy mobility, but Riot doesn't like silences on assassins. However, since this kit isn't a burst assassin, they might be alright with it. Sticking to a silenced opponent is much more realistic and reliable.\n\nFinally, you could give her some delayed damage or DoT. Think poison or bleed damage, or something similar to a {{champion:238}} ult or {{champion:26}} {{champion:18}} bomb. This means that Eve won't have to stick to her target to deal her damage, but that damage can also be counterplayed with shields or heals.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
