I have lost my account, \"runrunTJ\", after uninstalling and reinstalling League of Legends, also unable to log into it on my Boards.  As a level 30 who has been playing for 2 years, I doubt that I accidentally forgot my Username or Password.  Upon asking for help from \"Forgot my Password / Username\" I never get a response from my gmail.  Riot, please help..\n\nEDIT : To add, I admit that I currently do not know the gmail I used to officially create my account, after checking.     \nThat probably made this a lot harder.  I'll try finding my gmail soon to make this account.","replies":[{"poster":"IAmActualGarbage","date":"2016-09-28T03:06:51.181+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh my god Targons Blade thank you sooo much","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-27T23:38:28.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can submit a request to recover you account in a [support ticket.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) Be sure to fill out as much information about the account as possible so our account specialists can help you out.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"IAmActualGarbage","date":"2016-09-28T03:30:54.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Targons Blade,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=6V3w2U6m,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-09-27T23:38:28.928+0000)\n>\n> You can submit a request to recover you account in a [support ticket.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) Be sure to fill out as much information about the account as possible so our account specialists can help you out.\n> \n> Let me know if you have any questions.\n\nThe problem is that I don't know the email I made with my account.
