The client realizes that you might not be able to stay connected throughout the game, so it can't reliably connect you to any games.\n\nWe should be able to get that button lit back up by going through the steps in this [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).

I had to disable one of my PC-Protection apps because it went into overdrive and stopped League. Contact Riot support and they'll probably tell you to do the same.","replies":[]}]}
