Again, it&#039;s not a big deal, by no means is it something that needs to be rushed ASAP, but I hope it&#039;s on the list of things that need fixing.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-11-06T17:51:42.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Lenidax! ^-^ \n\nThanks for the report!

I personally try to reply to as many skins-related issues as possible. To play devil's advocate, it can become difficult to reply to each thread, as well as tackling our daily in-house work, especially with the release of larger patches; Star Guardian or Elementalist Lux. I know I've had issues keeping up with replying in the past, which is why I've started tracking all skins-related bug fixes in the patch notes. It's a central location for any/all fixes we've done. It isn't perfect, but it's a start for better visibility. \n\n**I mean, i would really love this feature on the bug boards in which, if a rioter looked into it and logged in, the post will show green, or the title, or a sign or something (a thumbs up).

I don't manage the structure of the boards, so I can't speak to what kind of work that'd take. Happy to suggest it, though! \n\n**How about letting us search in your logged bug files to know which ones are logged in?

I made 3 detailed Bug reports with repro steps and video clips and everything, and I still don't know if a Rioter has even seen them. I guess so, I know you guys read a lot of stuff on the boards even when you don't reply, but I don't **know** and that's a bit disheartening... (For the records, it wasn't on Skins.)\n\nOf course, the \"green posts\" suggested by AnataBakka would be perfect, but even a simple copy/pasta would be great.","replies":[{"poster":"AnataBakka","date":"2017-11-06T19:45:53.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"exactly, it's got more value on the bug reports since players may report the same bugs if they happens constantly and annoy them. \n\nThere's something that gets on my mind tho. I would be ok with that, but others may not, right? Some people may then post threads like \"Why did you think my bug is not a bug\", and this may annoy rioters. \nStiil, making a big thread saying \"We won't comment to every post and posts asking why we didn't consider it a bug won't be looked on\" may keep those posts away.\n\nI think having a bot automatically reply when a rioter tells it too is the best choice.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
