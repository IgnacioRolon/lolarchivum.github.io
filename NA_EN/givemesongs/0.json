My general ping over to Chicago is fine - Pingtest has it at ~30 ping.  http://imgur.com/a/kdNG7 \n\nIt's a different story ingame.  I ran a log-reader and this is what I got.  http://imgur.com/a/XMzaB\n\nI ran WinMTR and it looks like there's some obstruction to the Riot server specifically?  \n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/CuTNK  \n\nIs this something fixable on my end, or is it a problem further down the pipeline?\n\nEDIT: Nevermind.  Looks like this is something on my end.  Hopped on a different game and had 300-400 ping to everyone as well.  I guess I should just contact my ISP?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-28T18:22:17.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does sound like you've got a connection problem reaching our game servers, and my first thought was possible packet loss.  Your information in these images do seem to affirm my suspicions and your ping is skyrocketed as soon as it starts hopping along your ISP's node.  \n\nTry out the steps in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to try and fix this, and I recommend putting emphasis on the DNS change section.  If that doesn't work then you may need to contact your ISP to see what the deal is.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"givemesongs","date":"2017-01-28T18:36:30.705+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fixed, thank you!","replies":[]}]}]}
