Lately I've been having massive problems with even getting towards the loading screen for a few games now. I never managed to even connect ones and have been nailed with being a leaver.  I have decided to use the hextech repair tool to reinstall the game, I've let permission through the firewall and everything and thought I might have just fixed it. \r\n\r\nI go and make a custom game to verify if it has been dealt with. Sadly I have not even come close to enter the loading screen and I receive the same message telling me that I am unable to connect to the server, that I must check my internet connection and try again. How is this possible? I managed to enter the main page and everywhere else without any sort of problems. My connection is the problem it says? How when I can enter everywhere on the internet including other games without a single problem.\r\n\r\nI sent a ticket recently to Riot Support and after I sent the message I have been unable to log in the page, since it \"signs me out\". After I checked my email I finally get a response and I send riot the logs that they need, only to get a message saying that they are glad that everything was fixed. Fixed? In what moment did I say that my problems have been solved?\r\n\r\nI hope someone can actually assist me, I am not trying to be disrespectful towards anyone but I actually feel insulted that they just threw my situation aside.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-07-31T20:56:17.585+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If nothing in Riot's connection guide (Rineyy linked it) is helping you, you might try using a VPN. I recommend [Hotspot Shield](https://www.hotspotshield.com/).\n\nAs for your ticket not being appropriately answered, it could've been your ticket was unclear or that the Player Support member simply misread. You can always reopen your ticket and talk to them again. Try to keep it neat, minimal, and respectful to improve communication between you and them.","replies":[{"poster":"DeShanc","date":"2016-07-31T21:33:36.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh my god the thing worked .-.

I recommend you continue to work with the agent you have a ticket with to track down where the issues are along your route. I looked into your ticket and it does seem the specialist mistook what you said as saying the issue was resolved. Since they have your logs and a follow-up reply, they'll be getting back to you soon.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DeShanc","date":"2016-07-31T21:21:19.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will download and see if that helps >~<","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2016-07-31T20:42:09.173+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Disconnection before the loading is likely due to your network not establishing a stable connection with the game servers.\n\n[Troubleshoot your connectivity issues.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/su16_keyart_1920x1080_0.jpg?itok=6nj8mHjj\n","replies":[{"poster":"DeShanc","date":"2016-07-31T21:20:44.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll try my best and see what I can do with the options there.","replies":[]}]}]}
