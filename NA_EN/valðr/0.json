And a lot of the time even if I&#039;m not honored everyone honors and we all gain a little bit of progress.\n\n I&#039;m really just wondering if its logical that I can get to honor level 3 before the season ends? I play daily, probably 5-10 games a day depending on the day, and get honors like I stated above. Is it possible that I can get honor 3 before the season ends??\n{{sticker:vayne-pose}}","replies":[]}
