I'd compare their DPS in the practice tool but you can't set the dummy's health, so she does comically large amount of true damage per vital to it (since it has 10,000 health). Yassuo at least seems to think it's not too hard to beat Fiora as long as you hold onto your tornado. I could be wrong though.

It's its ability to make him literally immune to any damage from her for two seconds.

Yasuo stands a chance if he can mind-game her Riposte and if the Fiora's reactions are too slow for her to Q when Yasuo Q's (mine are). Otherwise, Fiora's damage is just much higher, in terms of burst. She's got a 410% base AD ratio, substituting one of the base AD ratios for her Q's base damage, followed up by a 200% attack speed crit. Then her Q and E respectively add 110% AD and 100% AD + 200% AD + 200% AS boosts every ~2 seconds and ~5 seconds.\n\nAlso, Yasuo is squish. Especially mid game, at 3 items, Fiora will be half healthing Yas with the inital burst combo. Late game, Fiora can invest in more tank items and still retain incredibly high damage, whereas Yasuo's damage will start to fall off as he builds less cost effective items, while Fiora is investing in tank items.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Elkington VI","date":"2017-02-25T14:07:38.370+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":7,"body":"I didn't even know Fiora had an AS slow.
