Theres one thread that has 350 likes and over 400 comments talking about yasuos kit being toxic and something needs to go.\n\nI really think Riot should consider Yasuo as a champion to be nerfed in the next patch. Hes sporting one of the highest play rates with an above 50% win rate.","replies":[{"poster":"The Last Ballad","date":"2016-08-01T03:31:52.301+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are a persistent person.

Ok well 900,000 of those people dont have a boards account. \n\nIf you're going to try to pull statistics on a math major atleast know whats affecting those stats kid.","replies":[{"poster":"AsphodelNext","date":"2016-09-05T01:37:49.218+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you actually knew your stats, you'd know to say that the statistical significance of a sample is based on the size of the sample, not the size of the population. \n\nFor example, suppose you want to measure the average fire ant thorax length. You only have to measure a reasonably sized sample of a few hundred, even though there are billions of fire ants. Similarly, political polls measure in hundreds, even though the US voter turnout is in the hundreds of millions.\n\nThe real statistical issue here is selection bias. You say most people don't have boards accounts; it's possible that the method of surveying by polling boards users biases the results. In addition, there is also response bias, where people who do not have very polarized opinions simply do not respond.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Last Ballad","date":"2016-09-05T01:04:53.618+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yet you are still using the .0004% to prove the will of a substantial amount of people.
