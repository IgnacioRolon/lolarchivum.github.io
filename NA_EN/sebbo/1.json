Meanwhile, MD is mostly used on champions that already have decent clear, just to shove even more or delete the cacnon minion and go roam.\r\nTherefore I suggest you up the %dmg you deal to minions maybe by 5% and 2% after the first use, and if you use it on a cannon minion, you deal 1/2 or 3/4 of its healthbar.","replies":[{"poster":"Seer of Mind","date":"2018-04-19T15:25:08.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"MD is really useless, its only bonus dmg to what ever minion you use it on, they need to replace it or just remove it overall","replies":[]},{"poster":"C9 Squeeky ","date":"2018-04-19T14:59:57.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should just remove it TBH.
