Removing the Health Scaling on his True damage is the main culprit to olaf's lack of success. Building Items on Olaf is pointless because he doesn't do enough damage to warrant it. This means playing Olaf is pointless because he doesn't exert the kind of pressure needed to truly  carry games as olaf.  \r\n\r\nWhat's the point of building tanky on olaf if you do no damage? All you bring is a slow. You don't have any real CC outside of that. \r\nWhat's the point of building damage on olaf if you can't survive long enough to do the damage you built for? You have no way of getting in range quickly enough to deliver your damage.\r\n\r\nSo you'd think there's some kind of middle ground. But there's not. There are no items olaf can build that allow him to live longer AND do more damage. Either these type of items don't do enough damage, or they don't let him live long enough. \r\n\r\nAnd the icing on the cake was losing much of his offensive capability in all aspects (lower true damage, no armor penetration, minimum range on Q) and then you took away his defense when he ults (which by the way, makes no sense. No other champion is like that, and 6 seconds if being immune to CC isn't some end all be all ultimate, you're just picking on Olaf. Or your design views on Olaf are really really bad).\r\n\r\nLike when I play Olaf, I don't feel good about it anymore. He has too many challenges to overcome to win a game.","replies":[{"poster":"Darth Kitti","date":"2014-08-30T19:43:41.590+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"I have to completely disagree. I have been having fantastic success against all my lane opponents as olaf. He is a monstrous lane bully, I have been able to completely shut down most traditional lane bullies like renekton, Ryze etc. The fact is I have too much sustain as olaf compounded with the absurd damage on his e, and I will shove you out of lane or you will die. I have easily 1v2'd the enemy laner and jungler coming out alive because of his passive. I will always get a BotRK and then go full tank. And while it is true that I won't be able to insta-burst anyone down that isn't my job. My job as olaf is to stick to the enemy adc and make their life a living hell, which is easily done with the BotRK.","replies":[{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2014-08-31T00:43:49.031+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"the problem is not winning lane 1v1 with olaf...the problem is doing something in teamfights other than getting kited/blown up if you´re not already ridiculously far ahead.","replies":[{"poster":"Cloud Potato","date":"2014-08-31T01:48:14.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And if you're ridiculously far ahead, you steamroll the enemy team because they can't kill you.

Either CC-immunity is no big deal and it should be spammable+olaf gets a shield, or it is a big deal and should be removed from black shield.

Feel very weird turn red but not run fast...\n\nI think that he can be reworked keeping the same identity (Berseker) in his role but making him more viable.\n\nFor example @RockBall I like that idea of 2 charges in his Q is wonderful (Corki ult but only with a cap of 2 charges)\n\nFor me have a lot of sense he have 2 axes so its obviusly he can throw 2 axes. This new mechanic need an increase in the cd but add more chance to sticking and chase. Also add the option to refund a 30% of mana cost if pick an axe (60% if pick both) can help to evade the oom in lane.\n\nNow make his E into a gapcloser with a low range (Maokai W 525) can help him a lot specially to gank or chase people but like the Q need to increase the cd slighty.\n\nThis two changes can help a lot an make much viable.\n\nNow the passive, W and ulti can manage the Berseker part.\n\nMaking a sinergy with the three to give Olaf the identity of Berseker.\n\nSo the passive can remain like the actual but now have more relevance.\n\nThe W need to change, first take off the AS buff (too redundant with the passive) and replaced by AD buff, But this AD is not a flat amount, this AD work like the passive, so when Olaf activate the Vicious Strike he gains AD increases by 1% for every 1% of his missing health, Also buff the life steal amount to make more useful. (10 14 18 22 26 % LFS )\n\nAnd now the Ulti need changes first keep the passive defenses ALWAYS. In the active part take off the AD flat bonus (put into the E) and replaces with MS buff (15 25 35 %). And finally gain a new mechanic that increase in 50% the passive and Vicious Strike amount during the duration of Raganarok.\n\nSo this really give him a Berseker identity specially when he is nearly to death, So now Olaf turn into a champ that everybody fear when he is weak specially under the Ragnarok effects.\n\nIs the same set but with nice changes to make his identity of Berseker more revelant and make him more viability.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Skaarrjj","date":"2014-08-30T19:41:31.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't understand how riot could butcher a champion who literally has to  walk up to you to do anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Noctis Lunaris","date":"2014-08-30T19:45:28.030+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:72}}","replies":[{"poster":"Skaarrjj","date":"2014-08-30T19:48:40.513+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's be real.
