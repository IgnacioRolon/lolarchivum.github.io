I was wondering, Mr. Scruffy, what your view on the matter is and what, if any, changes will be made to address this.\n\nFEEDBACK: If you look at my match history, I've been playing a LOT of Sion, and I believe I have a very firm grasp on him.  I believe his \"Q\"  could use small extra \"oomph\" during the late game.  Maybe a boost to his AD/lvl, a small offensive scaling with the health gained from \"W,\" or something.  It's pretty spot-on for the most part, though.  Late game it's mostly for utility, anyways.  His \"E\" feels a little lackluster later game, although it's amazing in lane.  Maybe this is an intended trade-off.  I don't know.  A LOT of people seem upset with how lackluster his passive is, probably the most common complaint I've heard about him, but I believe it's close to the mark.  I didn't realize it when I first played Sion but he's unique among tanks in the sense that he aggros CC from the opposing team.  His abilities demand respect, and leaving his Q or his passive to go on a rampage can spell doom for the opposing team.  With that being said, I believe his passive could use a very mild buff.  It's not fun when you can't even land a single hit with it.  I highly suggest an increase in the duration of the Death Surge ability, maybe 0.5-1 second extra.  I believe this would be better than him bleeding out slower because it just feels bad knowing you got nothing out of his passive if they're just barely faster than you.  Aside from his skills, he still feels like he needs quite a bit in terms of stats.  Mercury treads are almost always a necessity on him for the tenacity.  It's also a bit difficult to always find room for one AD item or CDR for him.\n\nOverall, my opinion from extensive play time with Sion is that first and foremost, he is a VERY fun champion!  Thank you guys so much.  He truly captures the feel of a juggernaut and makes me feel like the final boss.  He could use just a little bit of love, though, but he's not as bad as people make him out to be.

Sion is trying to make up a 500 hp deficit on his scaling up hp before he is even MATCHING what he should be at if he was just a normal bruiser.  Right out of the gate, he has a glaring weakness he has to make up for... on what should be his best aspects.  I could understand if it was a 200, or even 300, hp deficit.

The damage for a skill that requires you to do nothing else for 2+ seconds though, which easily gets outscaled by AA damage in that same time, let alone ease to dodge...

Makes the lane less of a minefield when ulting down a lane.  Perhaps have a very unique mechanic to Sion, the ability to shatter the tower rubble so it no longer exist, and faintly less unique, if his ult hits a (living) enemy tower, does moderate damage to it, but stopping him.\n2.  Wider hitbox.  If not this, let him, upon a second activation, do a leap (Similar to what he currently does) but instead of just stopping, he slams the ground for a higher AoE radius around himself knockup, although at half the damage.

Also, maybe leading the camera a little in the direction you are heading would be nice so that you have a little time to aim.\n\nI understand that he is supposed to drain health quickly and giving his passive tenacity and/or a slow wouldn't be so great. Tenacity has proven to be kinda op (zac and singed know) and the movement ability he gets is there to *help* stick with the enemy (getting a phage or mallet works well on him if u have problem doing so) but it does feel kinda annoying to build so much health only to lose it so fast i think maybe reduce the life steal and give the drain a flat but increasing amount kinda like how swains ult works but with health instead of mana so that way you do still drain health rapidly but you are somewhat rewarded for getting health and resistances instead of for building ad and resistances as it currently is. It is kinda saddening to build so much hp and not really be rewarded but, I guess with his shield scaling off of health and having 2 sources of % damage and insane amounts of ad ratios on ult and q it might make him too strong idk.\n\nAtleast to me the sion's the kind of champ i can build how i want; I can build tanky but still be a threat with his cc and % damage from passive, go AD and nuke people with q and ult then do insane amounts of damage with passive and pray to god no one cc's me, or go ap and surprise people with the damage from w and e. All these builds still allow sion to be the big scary monster he's always been which I am extremely grateful they somehow managed to preserved that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Finnical","date":"2014-10-29T14:03:33.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like the idea of him smashing the rubble. Because the enemy team can hear him ult they would likely know what he did, especially if they were allowed to hear the tower break. In addition breaking the tower could slow him for a moment, giving the enemy a second to react. I fear if all the towers got cleared out it might be a touch too strong.

Something like:\nP:  A%\nQ: B%\nW: C%\netc.\n\nBecause I feel like the chart that the Rioter would make would differ significantly from player charts. I get the feeling they put a lot of power budget into his Q and Passive, but the unreliability of both of those moves should lower their effective power budget. I mean, his fully charged Q could do 3000 base damage, but if you can't ever land it outside of extraordinary and rare circumstances, it shouldn't cost that much of his budget. My personal chart would looks like this:\n\nP: 10% - Either very powerful or very useless. And given how commonly a slow or harder CC is built right into champion kits, or built with {{item:3153}} {{item:3022}} {{item:3025}} {{item:3146}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3116}}  , there's no reason to believe Sion is going to get a lot done with his passive the majority of the time.\n\nQ: 10% - Same as the passive, either devastating or nothing. The move also roots you in place for the duration, and can be cancelled. Half-charges can be useful since that's the best you should be hoping for, but half-charges aren't nearly as big of a threat as a full charge.\n\nW: 30% - Lots of power here. Infinity scaling HP, a shield that scales off of max HP, AND an AoE %HP damage ability all in one. The downside of having the shield be popped before the ability can be reactivated is a setback, but there's so much power here without it.\n\nE: 20% - This ability feels like it pulls it's own weight, and that's about it. It's reliable enough while still being a skillshot with a long and thin AoE, and having it's range be boosted by bowling the minions can be a great way to bring the pain to opponents hiding behind their minions. The attached slow and armor shred aren't really too noticeable unless the ability is maxed.\n\nR: 15% - You can go far, just don't hit a wall. You can have the same impact as a {{champion:54}} ult, if the global warning sound didn't tip off your opponents. You can miss and still gank, if you don't mind Sion's momentum carrying him 4-5 Teemos beyond where you told him to stop. At least it's on a very short CD for an ult, and it's impossible to miss at point blank range, where I find I get the most use out of it because it's reliable there.\n\nTotal: 85% - Less power than your average champion. Sion has great damage and lockdown ability, but only if you actually connect with his moves. And in the League of Mobility, that is one big \"if\". It feels like I'm playing 85% of a champion, and the rework did almost nothing to alleviate Sion's longstanding ability to be easily kited. When I look at newer champions like {{champion:157}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:222}} and see their kits have all this neat (and more importantly, RELIABLE) power/utility packed into them, it makes me disappointed that {{champion:14}} did not get the same treatment. You could make an argument for {{champion:150}} and {{champion:268}} power/utility either way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Razgriz","date":"2014-10-29T01:48:55.136+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> 1).

I can land a 1 second Q most of the time. The whole thing about the ability is it is great in teamfights or in the jungle where they don't have a lot of options to move. If they spend too much time moving in a teamfight they're spending that time not doing something else and they'll still usually take some damage anyway because Sion will activate it again just before they get out of it.\n\n2) He just needs to be able to Flash while ulting.","replies":[]}]}
