Run through our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide, which should fix things up!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-18T21:21:49.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like you're having problems getting the client to launch? Most of the time that's a sign that your OS doesn't have the right admin settings in place to allow League access to certain files. Update your permissions following the [**permissions guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) and let me know if that helps.
