I also understand its bannable to use outside programs while playing this game? I just simply want to unbind my enter key so the chat box never shows up and cant be opened even during fights. I&#039;m not used to playing games rated G that involve death and blood but just want ot make sure that a keybinding program wont get me banned.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-07-23T03:20:54.364+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game client cannot even detect simple macros or rebinds..
