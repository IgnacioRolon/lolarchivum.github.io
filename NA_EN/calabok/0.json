Once I satisfied, I took her to ranked, and was 7/1/8. Had a triple kill too -- as the jungler.\n\nSo, not everyone is some stoner who needs a month to learn something as simple as a champ in League. ^^\n\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2191115922/228953398?tab=overview\n\nAnd, I only ever got one kill on that Yasuo, by the way.

All the players of Taliyah, no offense intended, suck pretty badly. I was in a normals and this taliyah, although not intentional, kept feeding brand. Thanks to the fed brand, we lost in the end. What pissed me off was she used her ult so it blocked my way. But still, taliyah either is not so hot a character or the players suck bad.","replies":[]}]}
