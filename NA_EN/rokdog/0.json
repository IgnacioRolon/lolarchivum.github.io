It may seem odd being thanked for doing something that 1) you probably enjoy 2) is the dream-job of many and 3) also comes with a paycheck, but last year I got to experience gaming in a way I never had before. My friends and I took a road trip from Arizona to California for the 2013 semi-finals at the Galen Center near USC. Among our company was my best friend of over a decade who I used to stay up late with playing countless games of DotA All-stars during Frozen Throne's hey-day. He's the same friend who introduced me to League and it was love-at-first-sight. His name is Louis, and despite suffering from his second round of cancer, he was a total trooper and went with us. He got to meet Sky Williams, C9's Hai, Snoopeh and many other League \"personalities\" and got some great pics and had some great conversations.\r\n\r\nWe screamed until we were hoarse while watching the match live, but Louis didn't. Not because he wasn't able to or wasn't excited, but because it's not who Louis was. Every one of us remembers him as the player who never raged. He studied Buddhism and was one of the best damn examples of living it that the West has ever seen. Always calm, always accepting, always patient. He won battle after battle against his cancer, but in the end it won, and claimed his life this year in June. The Season 4 World Championship happened to fall on the 27th birthday he would have had on October 19th; I can only imagine his smile at that.\r\n\r\nI apologize for the heavy story, but I felt as Season 4 came to a close, it's important to me and helps give me a little closure to know that I've told you how you have all provided me and my best friend with countless hours of entertainment and some amazing memories. So from the bottom of my grieving heart, thank you. On top of being an amazing company with record-shattering growth, you're still very personal and down-to-earth with your players as the recent Q&amp;A with Kalista proved. Please please please never lose that. Don't go the route that companies like Activison-Blizzard has. It's what has kept me here since season 1 and provided my friend and I with the kind of memories that we have.\r\n\r\nThank you, Riot.\r\n\r\n- An extremely (how much is extremely anyway?) grateful fan","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sweet","date":"2014-11-12T21:01:09.674+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey Rokdog, thank you for sharing this â€” even though it must have been difficult.  \n\nIt's a beautiful thing when you're able to connect with like-minded players and form bonds of friendship. Or when games enable you to build stronger relationships with existing friends. It's part of the magic that make games special. I remember my guild from WoW was my family for many years, just like my co-workers at Riot are like my family now. Many of us here, maybe all of us, have similar stories of friendship, love, dedication and even hardship. \n\nLouis sounds like an amazing guy and it sounds like we lost a good one when he finally 'left the game'. My sincere condolences, though it won't ease the pain in his passing, his memory will live on with you and now with everyone you have shared it with. \n\nFinally, **thank you**. You are the reason we do this every day. You are the reason we work hard. We are here for you, and each and every player out there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ecliptika","date":"2014-11-11T23:58:19.752+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your story is so bitter sweet.
