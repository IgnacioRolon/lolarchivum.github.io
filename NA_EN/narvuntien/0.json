Couldn't buy items and the minions were standing still, but I (and my team) seemed to still be moving. But no attempting to reconnect popped up to tell me I had disconnected.\r\n\r\nSo I  to quit to attempted to reconnect to fix it.. but the game would not load back up. I was just stuck at \"in game\" next to my name in chat and a otherwise blank client\r\n\r\nMy internet appeared to still be working.... although it stopped working whille I was attempting to reconnect.... I turned my modem on and off again....still didn't work but my internet worked immediately after I closed the client.\r\n\r\nJust want to say i didn't rage quit but the game didn't regester a disconnect so I am worried I am going to lose honor for this :(.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-21T17:07:05.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe you that you didn't rage quit!
