Starting a couple of days ago my ping has been at a steady 135 ms delay and randomly goes back to normal mid game. There are no downloads or any sort of scans running on my computer at the time. Has anyone else run into this problem and/or know a fix?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-22T03:47:06.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That specific process should only be active while in-game I believe, and it takes so much data simply because of everything that's happening in-game and all the data going between your pc and the servers. No issues there ^_^!\n\nThe abnormal ping however, I'm wondering if this is related at all to the issues Verizon has been having lately. Let me know if you're on Verizon or not, and we can run a couple tests to see exactly what's happening.","replies":[{"poster":"Meat Beat Mania","date":"2018-01-22T03:56:24.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm on Verizon. :^(","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Night Falls","date":"2018-01-22T14:09:05.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was in a party of 5. Usually we all get 30-35 ping. Starting Friday the ping spiked to 130-135. All of us spiked at the same time every game. We all live around the same area, all with Verizon. We kind of just assumed that the lag was caused by a high influx of players due to the weekend and new season. Everyone's trying to do placements and climb xD.","replies":[]},{"poster":"zennana","date":"2018-01-22T00:49:07.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its league of legend ux.exe who did this : \nduring the champion select :\nhttps://ibb.co/bBMfww\nhttps://thumb.ibb.co/bBMfww/chs.jpg\nduring the game :\nhttps://ibb.co/fvoX9G\nhttps://preview.ibb.co/dbvC9G/gm.jpg\nyou can see how much he is using the band, and thats why we all have lags, its because riot is sending a lot of UX data. plz riot fix this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"zennana","date":"2018-01-21T23:35:19.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the problem is that a proccess called LeagueOfLegendUX is using a lot of the brodband, and i think that riot is collecting a lot of users data, thats why we got this lag pbm, i lost many games too because of this, so please RIOT stop this UX process","replies":[]}]}
