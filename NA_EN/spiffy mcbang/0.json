If there is, I can repost there.)\r\n\r\nI normally play support, but I needed a backup position so I started picking jungle. I just got into a game as jungle, scrambled to make sure all my runes and masteries were in place, and... wound up leaving at the start so the other players could remake the game because I forgot to switch exhaust to smite.\r\n\r\nI know it&#039;s my responsibility to make sure everything&#039;s correct, and I&#039;m not trying to shirk blame, but this happened once before months ago and the game wasn&#039;t even worth playing because of my mistake. There also have to be plenty of others who only play jungle once in a while for whatever reason to whom the same thing might happen. So I thought, if the client can automatically apply our ARAM summoner settings (ie. snowball) when we go into those games, could we also have the client automatically make one of the summoners smite if it isn&#039;t already? Then if someone blanks on checking their summoners, the worst that happens is they&#039;re running smite/exhaust or smite/ignite. Their entire job as a jungler isn&#039;t screwed.","replies":[]}
