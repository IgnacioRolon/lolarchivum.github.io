The reason for this is because Riot isn't going to change Fizz back to his original state or lower his ratios after they changed him from an AP assasin to an AD bruiser. Riot is not going to gimp his ratios anymore since there are still people playing AP fizz and it will further upset them and make the champ even worse than it is now. \n\nOn the other hand, if Riot buffs his ratios to where they were before the reign of the AD fizz, the old AP fizz will simply re-emerge and create more toxic one-shot playstyles. The only thing I can see Riot doing is nerfing (possibly removing) the damage amplification or lowering his stats and then give his ratios a slight buff so AD fizz can be toned down to a controllable level. Hopefully we will see more AP Fizzes back online as what Riot would have wanted.\n\nNidalee, however, just needs some fine tuning for her damage or CDs and that's it so she's way easier to hot fix.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xx420n0sc0p3sxX","date":"2015-03-07T19:37:18.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fizz or Nid, def not Lee lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Inquizelus","date":"2015-03-08T01:11:12.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"All 3 got gutted already, though..","replies":[]}]}
