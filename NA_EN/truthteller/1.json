A strong mobile jungler like him needs to have some kind of trade-off if he decides to build nothing but tank items and still gets to do a shit ton of damage enough to oneshot a carry or support. Right now, it makes zero sense for someone as strong as him to deal absurd amounts of magic damage for an aoe ability with AD scaling (Tempest). I think this should be the least Riot can do, if not we're probably not going to see any more Lee Sin nerfs for the next 100 years. \n\nFor some of you that are saying this change is going to gimp Lee and/or are unconvinced, let's take a look at {{champion:92}}  and {{champion:91}} . They both have abilities that scales with bonus AD and all of them deals physical damage including the passives. Do you recall any of them for having a shitty early, mid or late game? Me neither. Now imagine if one of their primary aoes (W for riven and W for Talon) did magic damage instead of physical, do you **SEE** the problem yet?\n\nThis change should have taken effect on him a long time ago. I'd rather play against a glass cannon Lee that oneshots me by building AD and armor-pen in 1 second than a bruiser or full-tank Lee that can do practically the same thing under 3 seconds mid game.\n\nI know Riot isn't going to listen to me but I want to find out who actually agrees other than those obnoxious Lee mains that trash talk everyone for a bad game. I'm really not asking a lot here and I firmly believe that he should be CORRECTLY rewarded for landing a narrow skill shot.\n\nEDIT: I sincerely apologize if I made this unclear to some of you but there will be no changes to his shield.\n\nINB4 downvotes from Lee mains","replies":[{"poster":"Jefftiffy","date":"2015-03-07T19:47:43.138+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"His entire kit does physical minus tempest.

Have you even read my post?\n\nhuh what? \n\n1st talon doesnt have the greatest late game... he is a snowballing champion that excel at doing just that, at 6 items, there is a lot of solo laners that scale way better. Think of him as Zed without shadow mechanics. still decent damage, and definatly can kill a carry, but he is very prone to engage, stuns, and poke, and there is a lot of way to counter his burst.\n2nd Talon usually builds at least 2/3 of the Penetration items. he does so he can actually do damage. So unless Lee Sin does the same, he isn't going to do any damage later. In fact, if he does, he is likely to just get destroyed by his squishiness and lack of actual sustain damage, hence why bruiser/tank builds are favorable on Lee Sin for late game. At least that way he get his ult on and try to make plays, because he wont really do a whole lot more in team fights.\n\nPoint still valid.\n\nBTW, having mix damage on his ability means that the flat damage is reduced by armor, while the % is reduce by resist. This mean over all less damage at all stages of the game considering standard armor seals and resist glyphs. Champions will get tankier as the game progress, so this will affect him further more. Also, aside from maybe aegis of the legion (40resist + 20 to your teammates +200 hp) and maybe thornmail (100armor), there isnt any items that makes me think that armor or resist items have a significant cost discrepancy.  Maybe you should rethink about your miracle solution a bit more before trying to suggest \"balance\" in this game :)","replies":[{"poster":"Truthteller","date":"2015-03-08T02:33:37.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your thoughts, although I do realize that I have made an error in clarifying, but that doesn't necessarily stop me from stating the obvious strengths of Lee which is his magic damage.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"53872273_DEL","date":"2015-03-08T01:45:43.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Take out lee's lifesteal and spell vamp..
