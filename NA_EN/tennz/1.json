But ranked games are emotional for me and many other players. We live and breathe league. Ranked should not be considered for the casuals and thus Riot should be more lenient on what types of toxicity is allowed. Calling someone shit or retarded for making a terrible decision in a ranked game should be allowed. And flaming them for a loss should be completely under the guidelines. I'm a plat 1 player (could easily get diamond) and see nothing wrong with a teammate who wants to flame me. If it's justified I will say \"my bad\" or if they go too over the top then I'll mute the person. The thing is people at higher ranks generally win more than they lose, so its impossible for them to flame everygame and maintain their rank, so I just don't see the point of banning or chat restricting people over this. NOrmal games are a whole other animal because I believe these games should be casual and treated as such. If riot wants to ban and restrict people over flaming in normals, then I completely understand this. \r\n\r\nAlso hate speech such as homophobia, and racism I agree should not be allowed period.

At all. If Ranked is more serious, then it should be taken more seriously - meaning _absolutely **no** infighting whatsoever._\n\n> Calling someone shit or retarded for making a terrible decision in a ranked game should be allowed.\n\nNo, it shouldn't - especially not calling someone \"retarded\". If you want to harass people and use hate speech, go somewhere else.\n\n> ...and see nothing wrong with a teammate who wants to flame me.\n\nYou may not see anything wrong, but here's a few things for you:\n\n- Flamers play worse because they're focusing more on flaming than playing.\n- Flamers drain team morale, making _everyone else_ play worse, because the asshat who couldn't control themselves is demoralizing them.\n- Flamers are more susceptible to get worse and worse as the match goes on - the more it lists away from where _they_ want it to go, the madder they get, and the worse they play.\n\n> Also hate speech such as homophobia, and racism I agree should not be allowed period.

And nobody gets better by people being toxic towards them. I stated you could talk but you would have to keep it constructive and not an attack to provoke a reaction. Being competitive is irrelevant in this area. Just because you are competitive does not give you the excuse to be mildly toxic as you stated. In all other competitive scenes people are just constructive, and many times will discuss what went wrong post game. In league it is just the blame game in post game chat which brings people into the next match with residual tilt.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hyquiem","date":"2018-07-30T05:36:29.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"See now it just cuts to the point that the high elo players should be given things above low elo... but the only reason your probably high elo like in anyother game with a ranking system is due to you being an old player in the game.
