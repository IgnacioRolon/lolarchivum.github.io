And was told that being critical of my teammates performance (albeit absolutely no flame) is against the rules. Has Riot games been overtaken by some leftist SJWs? Apparently so. I&#039;ve never seen a game with such a low bar for inappropriate behavior than league of legends in 2018. I&#039;ve played this game for nearly 7 years and have not received a single ban until now.
