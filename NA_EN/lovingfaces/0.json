Match history lookup+","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im looking for the ability to look up all matches myself and another player have played together. I have googled my butt off and just cant seem to find a website that has the ability to put in 2 different summoner names and they would bring up our match history together. Does anyone have a tip or trick or maybe im just missing the website? thanks guys!","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-06T22:34:25.882+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm....I'm not aware of any 3rd party website that does this to be honest.  It sounds fairly interesting, but I wonder how much of a demand there is for something like this as it sounds fairly niche.\n\nI wish I had a better answer, but I wanted to at least post in here and confirm there is no direct way from a Riot source :(","replies":[{"poster":"LovingFaces","date":"2016-06-06T23:38:24.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK. I do know there is a pretty good demand. at least for my group of friends and friend list. Also this is a great way to find out what my stats are like with my duo supports. (I main adc and have a list of supports that I play with)\nsomething I could review with them and find where our faults are. now that there is a replay system we can at least commentate our selfs. But this would be a great add on! any chance i can get any more news on what this could turn into? would you be bringing it to a board meeting of other godly nerds who mod my favorite game?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zythnn","date":"2016-06-06T23:04:32.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"can i use a custom skin if it only changes the look no more\n{{summoner:2}}","replies":[]}]}]}
