I&#039;m not an aggressive player and I hate  taking high risk decisions. As such I don&#039;t like the pressure of having to do well early and I don&#039;t like diving into the middle of team fights so I hate assassins and really any melee except the ones like GP who are back liners in team fights because of ranged abilities. However, I also like champions with enough self-sufficiency to be able to split push because low elo players just aram mid and I want to get away from the clown fiesta while collecting all the farm available and closing the game myself. What champions possess all those qualities and what role should I play?","replies":[{"poster":"Geshultz","date":"2018-02-20T20:49:01.592+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, {{champion:164}} and {{champion:114}} are both pretty self-sufficient and can get into range and out of range with ease.
