Even if they were causing a problem, the best thing to do would be not to type and just report them after the game.\n\n> Ramen226: 4 queus are dumb as fk anyways\n\n-- Totally negative. I've met some of the coolest people while playing as the 5th wheel - and likewise I've met some really cool 5th wheels when we've been a 4-man team.\n\n> Ramen226: and your fgriend is trash who fed gnar\n> Ramen226: he fed zed 4 kills and then went top and fed gnar\n> Ramen226: he should be playing bots\n> Ramen226: i love playing with a 4 man that has a trolling zoe\n\n-- Now you're just being rude what with insulting people.

You're probably not a negative player by nature, but your behavior certainly worthy of report and a sanction. Depending on your previous sanctions/punishments it 'could' be a suspension or even perma.\n\nIf you've have no prior punishments and this jumped straight to a 14 day suspension I think that's a little harsh.\n\nJust my take.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-11-25T01:23:39.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, it is warranted.\n\nThe logs for punishments show only your messages because your ban is based on only your behavior.","replies":[]},{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2018-11-25T01:11:47.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's an escalating punishment system. 10 game chat restriction, 25 game chat restriction, 14 day ban, permanent ban.\n\nThose are the only possible punishments. After you get a 25 game chat restriction, your next punishment is a 2 week ban. for the same level of toxicity that would warrant a 10 game chat restriction.\n\nYou can disagree with it, but Riot doesn't want toxic players in their game. Their ideology is 'stop being toxic in chat or stop playing our game'.  After this 2 week ban, your next punishment is a permanent ban. People have gotten permanently banned as soon as the very first game after their 2 week ban. \n\nStop raging in chat, stop arguing in chat, stop insulting people in chat. Don't get reported.

The amount of reports doesnt matter, its the relation to the amount of games. 9 reports from one game counts as a single report. You need to have gotten reported in several games recently.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2018-11-25T01:11:31.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Context isn't relevant to the IFS when it comes to chat related offenses.
