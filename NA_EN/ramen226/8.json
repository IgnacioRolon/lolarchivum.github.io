There are other effects but that is the only important one for the post. THIS BONUS ATTACK DAMAGE SCALES INFINITELY.\n* At 2.5 attack speed you auto attack 150 times per minute.\n* {{champion:11}}  Equipped with {{item:3124}} attacks 225 times per minute.\n* This comes out to 225 stacks per minute.\n* Except it doesn&#039;t because press the attack counts as an on hit effect that will double stacks every other auto.\n* 225 / 2 = 112.5 x 3 = 337.5 stacks per minute.\n* Press the Attack grants 6.3 attack damage per stack at level 18. \n* {{champion:11}} {{item:3124}} at 2.5 attack speed will gain...\n\n    **2,126.25 attack damage per minute or 35.43... ad a second**\n\n\n\n\nLethal Tempo\n\n* Lethal Tempo grants attack speed for 3 seconds, 1.5 seconds after damaging an enemy champion (regardless of where they are on the map btw.\n* If a player is already at the max attack speed, they will instead exceed the attack speed limit. \n* Using my previous build with {{champion:11}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3031}} {{item:1419}} + 80% attack speed from lethal tempo at level 18...\n\n   3.42 attacks per second...Ok wait a second.... 2.5 x 1.8 (for the 80% from the lethal tempo) should have been 4.5... Ok so lethal tempo either adds on to his base attack speed or it really only lets a played exceed the attack speed limit, but if it does so doesn&#039;t grant additional attack speed. Either way I realized I was in the frame of mind that it would be a normal game. And 3.42 attacks per second is fucking incredible for a normal Yi build (that doesn&#039;t include his ult or another minor rune i forgot to take). So instead I decided to...make some altercations to my build to see just how fast we could go. \n\nhere are the final results.\n\n* {{champion:11}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3124}} {{item:1419}} was the build of choice.\n* I took the &quot;Legend: Alacrity&quot; rune which grants bonus attack speed + more attack speed per take down (maximum of 5 stacks)\n* Total bonuses: (Ultimate = 80%) + (Lethal Tempo = 18%) + (Lethal Tempo = 80%) we have the definitive maximum attack speed one can reach within the game.\n\n4.38 attacks per second x 1.6 for {{champion:11}} Double strike\n\n\n**7 AUTO ATTACKS A SECOND**\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \nI thought that was the most insane thing I&#039;d ever think about you being able to do in league.\nUntil a thought struck.\nNow\nThey&#039;re technically both keystones.\nAnd you can really only have one keystone.\nBuuuuuut....\nNow just stay with me ok...\nHow much ad could you stack per minute.....\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nIf you had the attack speed bonus from lethal tempo but the ad stacking potential of press the attack...\nTurn back now if you aren&#039;t prepared because this next bit isn&#039;t for the faint of heart. \nFor the remainder of the calculation I&#039;ll be using the number of auto attacks Master yi gets at 2.5 attack speed instead of the attack speed itself. (3.75)\n \napm = attacks per second\napm= attacks per minute\n\n* What&#039;s important to note is that there&#039;s a neat cycle for how Lethal Tempo works. There is the 1.5 second startup from when you damage an enemy champion, the 6 second duration, and the 6 second cooldown. This puts Lethal Tempo into a constant cycle of 13.5 seconds.\n* 4 sets of these 13.5 second fit into 60 seconds cleanly but it leaves open one last 6 second window. \n* After 1.5 second startup you get 4.5 seconds of sweat attack speed bonus. \n* You would be attacking at his base attack speed for 7.5 second each cycle, 1.5 for the startup, and 6 for the cooldown.\n* You would be at 3.75 for a total of 31.5 seconds. and at 7 for 28.5 seconds.\n* For the sake of small numbers we&#039;ll round them off at (3.75 aps for 31 seconds) and (7 aps for 29 seconds)\n* 3.75 aps x 31 = 116.25 apm while lethal tempo is inactive.\n* At 7 auto attacks per second for 6 seconds that is 42 auto attacks while Lethal Tempo is active for ONE cycle btw.\n* **7 x 29 = 203 for the time that lethal tempo is active**\n* 116.25 + 203 = 319.25 Attacks per minute or 5.3 attacks on average a second\n* 319.25  x 1.6 for the Rageblade doubling stacking every other auto = 510.8 stacks per minute \n* **510.8 x 6.3 = **3,218 ATTACK DAMAGE PER MINUTE or 53 A SECOND**\n\nYa know what fuck it. How much could you stack if lethal tempo was ALWAYS ON.\n\n* 7 attacks per second x 1.5 for the Rageblade passive double stacking = 10.5 stacks a second =\n\n**66.15 ATTACK DAMAGE A SECOND**\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n\nOk now that we&#039;ve had our fun I gotta say something. None of this is even optimized. As i was writing out the stats I started thinking that i can get a faster attack speed from nashors which could push it even further. Not only that but i searched on youtube to see if this would actually work... and nobody does it with {{champion:11}} \n\nInstead the first video that pops up is about {{champion:203}} reaching 10.3 attacks per second by continually stacking her passive.\n\nOh by the way, at (10.3 x 1.5 for rageblade passive) 15.45 attacks per second you would be stacking 97 attack damage a second and you would auto 376.2 times a minute.\n\nI didn&#039;t want the post to go to waste though so...here it is. Hope you enjoyed it\n\nOh i also went back and changed the number  A TON so if there are inconsistencies then that's why. Anything highlighted is accurate though.","replies":[]}
