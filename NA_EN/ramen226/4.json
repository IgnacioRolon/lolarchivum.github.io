You can't get punished in the middle of the game, that isn't what the \"instant\" in IFS means. It punishes after you report them after the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Ramen226","date":"2017-05-10T21:24:19.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Read the edit.

Why isn't one game of repeatedly using this kind of profanity not punishable to at least some degree. Like a warning or a minor 5 game chat restrict in case he really was just having a bad day. \n\nThat aside I find it unlikely that a player would have a clean record and then all of a sudden jump to using racial slurs. Meaning that this shouldn't be the first time someone reported him for slurs. So imo they're way too lenient about slurs and other stuff like that.","replies":[{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2017-05-10T22:37:30.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It totally is punishable.
