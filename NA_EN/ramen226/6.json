I usually start these by comparing the win rates of the members of our teams and this is what gets me fucked up. \n\nEvery lose I get in promos my team has a significantly worse win ratio than their team. For an example I&#039;ll use the stats of my last 2 games, both loses.I&#039;m a top lane main so the rates will go like a scoreboard is organized from top down. (for the second game i added in the mmr of each player, i would&#039;ve done it for the first game but i didnt think about it and it takes too long to load. The * means that too many duo games were played and the rating is probably inaccurate.) \n\n1st game\nMe 55% vs 65%\nJg   35% vs 47% (their worst player)\nMid 40% vs 55%\nAdc 53% vs 60%\nSup 35% vs 60%\n\n2nd game\nMe 55% (1395) vs 53% (1452)\nJg 45% (1383) vs 70% (1387)\nMid 70% (1403) vs 65% (1414) \nAdc 45% (1355****) vs 54% (1450)\nSup 30% (1355*) vs 50% (1370)\n\nI find it kinda wonky that 90% of the opponents I faced had win-rate of 50% or greater where when it comes to allies it was only 25%. Not to mention that the mmr of the players in game 2 were higher than everyone on our teams.\nNow win ratio isn&#039;t necessarily indicative of who is going to win, but it&#039;s an important enough stat to be taken into consideration when drafting teams. I understand that these teams are inevitable and with hundreds of thousands of games played a day shit like this is gonna happen, but it happens a little too often during important games to be acceptable.\n\n\n\nEdit: For those saying that it's not a large sample size, understand I do this with every loss I feel i couldn't have prevented to see if it really was my team under performing or it's confirmation bias. I also do this with wins that feel we couldn't have thrown if we tried to see if their team was significantly worse. SO when I show you 2 games you have to realize that I do this all the time and it's the same story (almost) every game. I'm only showing 2 because I don't have the rest of the stats on record and I'd rather not make stuff up to try and get my point across\n\n\nEdit 2: I see a lot of people are saying, \"Well if you win your mmr goes up and you place against tougher opponents.\" You're ignoring the whole point of the post. I said why do my team mates get worse, not why my opponents get tougher. If i were getting put in matches with higher skilled people across the board I'd understand but that's not what's happening. When in my promos to silver 1 i should be playing against people in that division WITH people from that division. But instead the people on my team are worse than the division I'm trying to get into and my opponents are BETTER than the division im  trying to get into. Saying that winning increases my mmr so i should get worse teams doesn't make sense. Especially because i clearly don't belong in the division I'm in if I'm constantly going on large win or lose streaks. (if its true that my teams get worse as my mmr increases)","replies":[{"poster":"koshkyra","date":"2017-09-26T02:57:59.076+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":4,"body":"This.\n\nI had a 5-game win streak in ranked this week\n\n6th game: every lane besides mine lost a little bit, we ended up losing the game (oh and they fed the jungler like crazy lul)\n\n7th game: toplaner gave up first blood before minions even spawned (it wasnt even to an invade, he was trying to 1v1 a mundo as jayce, wtf?), team fed 10 kills before the 8 minute mark, i was the only lane doing good until they decided to feed my ahri 3 kills after i gave them an mia like 20 seconds in advance and even said to them \"guys gtfo bot ahri is def coming\"\n\nWhat elo do i get competent teams in?","replies":[{"poster":"RaptureRage","date":"2017-09-26T09:51:21.237+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"thats the problem since season 7.

They are only tangentially relevant, in that people with an overall high win-rate have climbed in skill/MMR some time in the past (maybe recently, maybe not).\n\n> Now win ratio isn't necessarily indicative of who is going to win, but it's an important enough stat to be taken into consideration when drafting teams.\n\nIsn't this exactly what people want less of? Where you get much tougher matches any time you go on a win streak?\n\nI mean, personally, I think win-rate could be a decent indicator for fast-climbing individuals, as long as MMR remains the primary factor. That is, anyone on a win streak could get slightly tougher matches, and (as it currently works) they would receive more MMR for winning those tough matches. But on the other hand, win streaks are very important for getting through promos, which is already a big point of pain. So overall, I think it's better to just leave win-rate out of the conversation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GirlBrains","date":"2017-09-26T20:28:42.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot does infact incorporate a system they dont tell you about which evaluates players on performance beyond win/loss ratio. (Gpm = gold per minute). Riot is deeply afraid of losing its playerbase so they actively add new mechanisms to bring players closer to a 50% win ratio so they play more games. Which is why if you had a game where you went 30/0 your next game you will probably be matched with horse shit for teammates","replies":[]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2017-09-26T20:17:56.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's partly because your MMR surpasses your skill, relates to their win streaks _and_ loss streaks, and a lot of other factors.\n\nIf you're on a winning streak, they tend to pair you with people on a losing streak, and visa versa. This is to check if you actually _deserve_ that promotion/demotion. It's to see if you just had shit/amazing luck with teammates, or you're actually good/bad. If you just had bad teammates, being put with a teammate on a winning streak should mean that you'll win. If you were just lucky, being put with losing ones will do the opposite.\n\nThis also affects your mental state. If you're losing, you'll feel more and more shit, and you'll start playing worse, getting stuck in a defeatist attitude. You'll end up doing worse and worse, and each failure makes you do worse. Riot intentionally tries to break this, by essentially \"giving\" a player on a bad streak a win once in a while.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cloudah","date":"2017-09-26T16:20:03.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably because if you win more you raise your MMR therefore you are placed against higher MMR opponents?","replies":[]}]}
