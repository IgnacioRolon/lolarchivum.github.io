But nobody has said that about the text chat. Why?\r\n\r\nBecause it sounds stupid to say. The point of muting someone else is because I as a player have made the descision that the risk reward of: Them continuing to harass me VS. Them having a change of heart and becoming a productive member of the team is too great a risk to continue to let them communicate. We&#039;re allowed to prevent a player from talking directly to us but just about everyone knows what they&#039;re trying to say when you see the &quot;???&quot; pop on screen.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve already made a few posts about muting pings but I kinda just realized why the argument opposed to muting pings really doesnt make sense seeing as they already allow us to mute the text of a specific player. \r\n\r\ninb4 riot sees this and thinks the point of it is to remove the mute player option altogether,","replies":[{"poster":"Girard","date":"2017-03-31T02:18:54.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-03-31T14:20:36.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If somebody ????s me all game, I'll just have to turn off my sounds althogether, then nobody communicates with me anymore.
