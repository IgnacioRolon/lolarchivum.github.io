Survive-ability and DPS so low that it becomes a meme and everybody laughs and jokes about it for the entire season. Everyone laughs and claps about how amazingly fun it is that anybody can make an entire role completely useless. \r\n\r\n* Season 7 and now the tables are turned. You actually have to protect the ranged dps and can&#039;t rely on playing bumper cars with tanks and fighters to win. Not a day goes by where there isn&#039;t a post with 50-60 upvotes complaining about &quot;adc meta so boring why can&#039;t i just burst them down and make the role obsolete.&quot; Supports, the role designed to protect and empower this ranged carry, are now capable of protecting and empowering the ranged carry. Not a day goes by where people complain about how ardent makes adc&#039;s good.\r\n\r\n\r\n* The support is good everybody congratulates them and talks about how amazing they are.\r\n\r\n* The support misses every hook, has a bad build, has bad positioning, and is all around someone who needs more practice in normals before moving into ranked, nobody says a word. \r\n\r\n* The adc gives ANY type of advice and they get flamed by the entire team for being toxic and at least one guy says in /all to report them for being an ass.\r\n\r\n* Support dies and blames adc. Everybody blames the adc.\r\n\r\n* The ad carry carries the support out of laning. Everybody says gj to the support\r\n\r\n* Enemy assassin walks past maokai, jarvan, and janna and kills the adc. &quot;It&#039;s not that we aren&#039;t peeling, you just have bad positioning rofl&quot;\r\n\r\n* Adc decides that grouping isn&#039;t the best option and decides to pick up the wave at bot lane. Instantly at least 2 people are pinging you to group or flaming you for intentionally feeding.\r\n\r\n* Adc plays well all game. Nobody wants to peel or die to save you and blames you for dying and, inevitably, losing. \r\n\r\n* Adc play poorly all game. Everybody blames them for the loss. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#039;m starting to think that the community just hates adc&#039;s as a whole. I&#039;ve gone entire games without saying anything and in the post game lobby I have people saying to report me for flaming all game. Anything the adc says is interpreted as flaming regardless of how constructive it is or not. There was a post a couple days ago that was talking about removing crit chance as a stat all together or that EVERY marksmen should have a reload mechanic. And people were AGREEING with it. I was wondering how people could actually take that kind of statement serious when i realized it was just a marksmen hate thread. \r\n\r\nFor some fucked up reason the community has just decided as a whole that EVERY marksmen is toxic and that the role should just be obsolete or better yet removed entirely.","replies":[]}
