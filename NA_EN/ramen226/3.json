I'm not sure about *most* recent, but it at least needs to be in the game that triggered the punishment.\n\nThis is probably so that you get immediate feedback. It would be a little odd and disconnected to see, say, a message if you hadn't reported anyone in a month and some guy you forgot about but reported a month ago finally pushed over the line.","replies":[{"poster":"Ramen226","date":"2017-03-28T21:36:53.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude I'd just be happy to get the msg. \"Some dickhead you played with at some point got punished.\" WHo the hell wouldn't wanna get that lol","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"jpguy902","date":"2017-03-27T20:27:29.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you know they aren't getting punished?","replies":[{"poster":"Ramen226","date":"2017-03-27T20:31:44.728+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not getting the message that says they've been punished and depending on what they were doing I'll look at their match history the next day.
