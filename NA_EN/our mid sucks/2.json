Don't lie, I know Riven can facemash her combo and do damage but she's going to lose the game if she does that past laning phase and you know it. Don't lie, I know Yasuo does a lot of damage but how many times do you see these god awful morons just fly all around the battlefield only to die?\n\nWe try to pretend like people playing high skill cap champions are bad to make us feel better, I know you do cause I do it too. But realistically, these types of champions, Zed, Yasuo, Riven, Lee Sin, they actually do require the player to understand the mechanics of the champion and they require practice to play at a decent level. \n\nMost of you can't ward jump, and even if you can I know most of you can't ward kick, you rely on flash kick if that.\n\nMost of you rarely hit both your Shurikens on Zed and then wonder why your damage is lower than other Zed's you see. You also rarely get your E slow off and never keep track of your shadows.\n\nMost of you can't hit an auto after every Q on Riven, you fail every Q jump over walls and you somehow miss your ult or don't use it when it's needed or you just run randomly into the enemy team and get chunked.\n\nMost of you can't play Yasuo without someone else on the team having a guaranteed knock up to babysit you. Most of you randomly E Q into an enemy but your E takes you too far and you Q thin air and lose trades.\n\nThe point is, champions like these are not fun to play against when your opponent has an understanding of how to play them, but it does take skill. Even if we hate to admit it.\n\nBut then theres things like Master Yi or Caitlyn, where just a mild understanding of their abilities will get you very far.\n\nCan you honestly say you prefer champions like Riven/Yasuo over champions like Master Yi?","replies":[]}
