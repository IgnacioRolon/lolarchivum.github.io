I mean like... Raging about the other enemy champ/player in TEAM CHAT and didn&#039;t say anything in all chat because i have that set off. You get banned for speaking your mind or talking in your chat? Even if it&#039;s rage or flaming or expressing? IMO that&#039;s retarded because it&#039;s like literally taking away your freedom of speech. I mean honestly if your team doesn&#039;t like it or want to hear it they can mute you right? Right. So why should I get punished for just speaking my mind and raging in MY TEAM CHAT? Why is riot forcing us to LITERALLY only be &quot;sportsmanlike&quot; and limiting our speech? It&#039;s like if I said &quot;F**K&quot; in chat, I can get banned for that. I say it in public and there&#039;s no problem. Am I the only one (And I&#039;m sure I&#039;m not) that finds this pretty ridiculous??","replies":[]}
