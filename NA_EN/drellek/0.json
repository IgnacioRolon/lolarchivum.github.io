Everything works perfectly fine in the client but after champ select, the loading screen never fully loads and doesn't show the portraits for any champs. If I alt-tab and then go back then it will show all of the champions on the loading screen for a second and then the screen goes black. Eventually it will get in game and the same thing happens. If I go to LOL tab it shows the game screen for a second and I can move or do something real quickly but then the screen goes black and nothing I do affects the game. Any idea? I have tried to update videos drivers, I've reinstalled league, and many other things but nothing has helped!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-09T18:49:19.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This black screen usually indicates a network issue failing to connect to the server and download assets.
