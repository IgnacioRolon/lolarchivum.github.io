Ever since the servers moved I've always had 30-35 ping and never higher however earlier this month my in game ping has ranged from 60-75 every game. I ran WinMTR for a few minutes and this is what it gave me pinging the NA server.\n\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                             192.168.1.1 -    0 |  183 |  183 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                             192.168.0.1 -   98 |   38 |    1 |    3 |    3 |    3 |    3 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   37 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   37 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   37 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   37 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|      10-1-3.ear3.Washington1.Level3.net -   50 |   61 |   31 |   19 |  274 | 2200 |   24 |\n|                            4.16.252.202 -    0 |  183 |  183 |   45 |   53 |  132 |   51 |\n|                          104.160.137.35 -    0 |  183 |  183 |   49 |   53 |   63 |   50 |\n|          ae35-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 |  183 |  183 |   56 |   59 |   81 |   59 |\n|                           104.160.131.1 -    0 |  183 |  183 |   56 |   61 |   73 |   60 |\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting &amp; Cloud Provider\n\nThe no responses are from my isps DNS servers because they blocked pinging but I figured I'd post this anyways. They also refuse to allow me access to the modem and will not let me switch it to googles dns servers or openDNS and block all third party modems from using their service so that's what I'm stuck with. \n\nHowever if I use a personal VPN and connect to Chicago I get the same ping that I used to. \n\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                               10.1.10.1 -    0 |  177 |  177 |   31 |   34 |   44 |   37 |\n|ip-253-39-52-196.chicago.us.northamericancoax.com -    0 |  177 |  177 |   31 |   35 |   44 |   36 |\n|             vl51.br01.chi02.as46562.net -    0 |  177 |  177 |   31 |   37 |  45 |  42 |\n|             vl50.br02.chi02.as46562.net -    0 |  177 |  177 |   31 |  39 |  47 |   36 |\n|                           104.160.131.1 -    0 |  177 |  177 |   31 |   35 |   44 |   34 |\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting &amp; Cloud Provider\n\nThis is what I get connected to the VPN. Sorry the forums kind of broke the formatting on these. I'm assuming it probably has something to do with that washington node but I've tried to contact my isp multiple times just to be told that they can't do anything.

It's pretty unfortunate how that ISP has things setup (ie refusing you access to the modem settings.....rip) but it does sound like using that VPN has been a pretty successful workaround for the time being. I definitely don't want you to need to use that method every time, as it's just not optimal of course, so I'd like to get you in touch with our techies to see if they can figure something better out. \n\nHit them up in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with some network logs and those traceroutes and they'll be able to dig a little deeper than I can here.","replies":[]}]}
