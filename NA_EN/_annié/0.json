So, every time I get up to 13,900 IP I decide to come up with a new name.  After changing my name so many times, I kind of ran out of ideas, and decided to make my name \"BUTTHOLE SUCKER\".  I understand that this isn't the most \"normal\" name one could have, but considering that the game is rated T, figured that my name would be fine.  I wanted something unique that people would look at and maybe smile or something, because its not the type of summoner name you see every game.\r\nSadly, about an hour ago, my name was changed to \"noname48834\", and when I exited and relaunched the client it prompted me to choose a new summoner name.  I'm not really sure what to make it now - I don't want some boring name like \"WarmSpoon93\" or \"LargeBike32\", and while I have some slightly more funny and creative ideas, but I'm not really sure what Riot will and will not allow.\r\n\r\nAccording to the terms of use it says:\r\nSelecting a Summoner name that is falsely indicative of an association with Riot Games, contains personally identifying information, or that is offensive, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, sexually explicit, racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable.\r\n\r\nMy previous name was \"Lewd Annie\" for a very long amount of time, and that seemed to be perfectly fine in Riot's eyes.  (I was an Annie main, and like everything else with Annie in it was taken.)\r\nI also had the name \"Rengar Hentai\" for multiple months, which was also deemed okay. \r\n\r\nI just want to make sure this won't happen again before I change my name to something Riot doesn't like.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-20T02:42:21.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeeeaaaa I can definitely see where someone might take offense to that name, as it's pretty close to being sexually explicit. The phrase that was used can often be a sex act, which is why it was deemed inappropriate.","replies":[]}]}
