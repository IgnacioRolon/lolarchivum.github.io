Not only that, but my computer makes this strange buzzing noise when it freezes as well. I've tried playing a game 4 separate times and my computer has frozen all four times. The only thing that has changed about my computer since I last played (which was about a month ago) was that I got the Windows 10 anniversary update. I've uninstalled and reinstalled using the Hextech Repair Tool as well as running the HRT to no avail. Has anyone else had this issue? If so, what did you do to fix it? If I need to provide some more details I'm happy to do so.\r\n\r\nThank you","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-25T22:47:34.953+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've seen this issue quite a bit specifically after the Windows 10 Anniversary update enabled the Game DVR feature inside the Xbox game bar app. This should be resolved by [disabling the game bar entirely](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html).\n\nLet me know if that worked.","replies":[{"poster":"Pomogranate","date":"2016-09-26T14:07:56.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes that worked! Thank you! That's really strange since I had never even opened the Xbox app in my entire life so I had to make an Xbox account just so I can turn that setting off.
