It was about 3 days ago that my friend and I came back from school to play league of legends together, we try to login to our account and it says that our username or password is incorrect, we tried typing slowly about another 6 times then gave up and went to play on our smurfs. (which is this account i'm posting on} We didn't think much about it we just thought league of legends was having trouble remembering the older accounts. So we played on our smurfs for about two days, each day trying again to login to our mains, and then yesterday when my friend got on his smurf he noticed that someone was on his main. He called his brother and asked if it was him, he called everyone he knew to ask and they all said no. He tried messaging the guy on his account nicely to please hop off his account and the guy on his account said no. We tried to convince him messaging through our smurfs and he would block us. I have yet to see anyone on my account but I think my friend's and my account got hacked. They must of changed our passwords so we can't get back in. I have tried many times to recover my account by using the Forgot Your Password button but when it sends me a verification email I don't get the email. I do remember the email associated with the account also so I'm not sending it to the wrong email. My friend and I are getting really depressed because I spent over $100 of rp on my account and my friend has spent over $200 on his account. Nothing is working and I really want to know if there is a way you can help. My account username is, --snip--and my friends account username is, --snip--. We really need help, thankyou for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-12T21:24:26.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've snipped out the usernames for security reasons.
