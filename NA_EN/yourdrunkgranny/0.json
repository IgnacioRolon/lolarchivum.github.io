Riot should be nerfing sej, gragas, hecarim, irelia, nunu, kalista, and etc. WTF is this shit? Riven is so easily countered, falls off late game, already been nerfed from that bullshit black cleaver change, and now they&#039;re going to slow her and even make her ult slow? Riot&#039;s retarded. How is this even possible? She has like 10 counter champs : Darius, Malphite, Hecarim, Nunu, Irelia, Garen, Renekton, Olaf, Pantheon, Teemo, Fiora, and etc. Riot&#039;s retarded. She&#039;s also a very high skill cap. Seriously Riot? WTF explain yourself. These nerfs are not necessary.\n\nRiven&#039;s Q: 13 second CDR with having 1 cc at the end for like 0.5 seconds, and Q does no dmg until late game. Only used for passive stacks and auto cancel.\n\nRiven&#039;s W: Stun that&#039;s short ranged and less lasting than most stuns and cc (def less than irelia&#039;s stun)\n\nRiven&#039;s E: Nerfed so hard u have to time it to perfection and only used for shield and escape for 1 second.\n\nRiven&#039;s R: Only tool that allows her to do damage, and you&#039;re nerfing her finisher kit so that Rivens can&#039;t get kills. \n\nEven if riven snowballs, she can only snowball early to mid and she&#039;s basically useless late game other than splitting and 1v1ing people. She doesn&#039;t have a good teamfight potential because once she goes all in, she needs flash to escape or she&#039;ll get cced to death.\n\nShe's not even used in competitve gaming, she's used in solo queue. People don't know how to play against her which is why she might have a high win rate, but that doesn't mean she's overpowered. Riven is easily countered, falls behind late game, has no sustain in lane (lowest health per sec), and she's just horrible in today's meta. You can just stack armor (thornmail, randuin's and sunfire) and its over for rivens. What is wrong with Riot.\nYes, she has good burst and that's because she can cancel animations with hydra and other kits. That's really hard to pull off, and that's the only reason why she's played, because its high risk high rewards kind of playstyle, and she's the only \"fun\" champion that is in league of legends. Riven can be kited and cced down so easily it's stupid, and you just nerf her because people are upset about not knowing how to play against her because you let riven melee/near your range. She needs to use flash to get near her opponents in order to burst them, unlike leblanc, zed, ahri, lissandra, and etc. She has nothing to get close to people other than her q and e which is predicatble, and she has no escape after committment and has to wait for cdr to come back up, which is why people stack 40 percent cdr and try their best to spam for skills and escapes, but its NOTHING compared to Zed, leblanc, fizz, Lissandra, and other champions that has range, damage, assassin potential and teamfight potential. I really don't feel that this nerf is needed at all. If riven's being nerfed, why aren't you nerfing Zed, Leblanc, Lissandra, irelia, sejuani, nidalee, gragas, talon, rengar, and etc. She's strong when fed, just like any other champions. Don't nerf her because she gets fed and gets a 1v3 win, because riven is a melee god and if you're fed, you cannot do that to her with ult and everything.\n\nSigh, Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"VeggieBurger","date":"2015-05-07T03:59:15.517+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"it's barely a nerf.

New black cleaver doesn't provide 10 armor pen and the 50 ad. It also doesn't use brut as a build path, which is a big early riven nerf because it provides armor pen, 25 dmg, and 10 cdr. So new cleaver is a SLIGHT buff to riven late in terms of CDR and 30 percent shred, however it's a horrible early/mid build path, which is why you can't even build black cleaver nowadays and build youmuu's now which sucks for riven imo.","replies":[{"poster":"FirstSergeantBim","date":"2015-05-07T04:40:17.177+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"How many comments are there already about Riven \"snowballing too hard early, but not having a good lategame\"?

I don't think 5 MS and a little missile speed is too much to ask for in compensation.  \n\nBesides, I'd bet they changed the missile speed because Riven was getting so many multi-kill shots with that thing.  The speed reduction will probably allow Riven to only execute her intended target instead of the whole team.  Makes sense.

She is a very high skill cap, and it's obvious you don't play her or aren't in a high elo if you disagree, if she was a freelo champion she would be spammed horrendously and perma banned in lower elos, which she is not. Hecarim destroys many top lane matchups while being tanky not just riven, and riven gets destroyed by most tanks. If you've ever played riven you know what it's like to vs a garen, or a champion that legitimately does nothing but builds tanky and will destroy riven in lane.

However, if you don't think she's difficult to master, you're the one who is delusional. It has been amply demonstrated that she has a fairly high skill ceiling. I don't play Riven, and that's simply unfair to say they're arrogant for pointing it out when she is called a no skill champion.\n\nThat being said, that has no bearing in a Bronze/Silver game.

Riven is a very high skillcap champion with such simple counterplay to beat her, want to win vs riven? secret is: be a tank and don't feed her. her movement speed nerf, ok I understand that a little bit, but there's already so many champions who do similar amounts of damage and move just as fast that are even better in this meta. Udyr for example, moves just as fast as a riven with 40% CDR using abilities to move, but probably even faster. Her ult speed reduction is a joke, riven needs to be on top of you to all in you, and usually needs to flash or juke you in order to get on you without wasting half her abilities to get to you. Her ult can barely hit someone running, and what's the point in having a range to it if you're going to nerf the movement speed, so in practicality, when the speed matters is when you're using it at a range, and they're most likely running away if you're trying to execute them... but now you'll have like a 75% less chance to hit them because it'll be even slower. It's already not hard to outrun riven ults, it happens often and even more often when riven has to flash to hit it. For her ult to hit and be lethal, you're assuming that riven has won a trade with you, and with tank meta, that's much less likely to happen. Riven suffers late similarly to leblanc when teams group, and dies to any cc. Reducing the speed on her ult effectively reduces the effective range greatly, so now she's going to suffer more. If this champion absolutely needs to be nerfed again, because Riot no longer wants people to invest time into practicing high skill high reward champions, why not just play hecarim and do the same thing if not better, she needs to have her ult range increased somewhat greatly. If you're going to make a hard to play champion who suffers in lane vs most matchups, and has to be very good to just win skill matchups, you need to buff her in some way. If I go into a game, spend weeks learning riven, making sure I don't make any mistakes just to go on par with a matchup i should win? but then someone just plays a tank like garen and immediately wins hard even if I'm up 3 kills? that's a joke. There's so much wrong, but there is also some justice to the nerf, not that I still approve. There's a lot of things I wanted to say, but didn't say, so please if you have a problem with my post, reply to it and I'll be happy to answer back. Also I can't believe I almost forget to address her shield nerfs, if you're using her shield defensively, you're most like not running at them and are probably running away, and if they're shooting askill shot or medium speed ability, your shield is now going to be worthless. It's already been bad running from tower shots etc because if you shield away it already runs out before the abilities hit you, but not you need to be immediate with it, so use i to run, but you'll still get hit by any damage chasing you in air. Most importantly riven isn't even a champion you can pick into anyone or any lane, she has such a niche it's scary, her counter list is ridiculous. Want to play riven? well she gets countered by almost every tanky champion top lane, want to go her vs high damage champions? no mechanic champions like pantheon beat you anyway, want to play her vs the most optimal matchup? say high damage and squishy range people like gnar and vlad? well that only works if you flash or they misplay, they can play safe the whole game vs you. I would love to have an actualy intellectual conversation with rioters and players on this, I know this is very bm, but most players who hate her are low elo, vsing someone who is better than them. Riven is hard to play, and for the most part at a disadvantage when vsing an opponent of equal skill level, of course if she gets ahead she can carry lower elo games, anyone ahead can do that...I'm so annoyed I'm all over the place with this rant, so if you have a problem please address it with me and I'll be more than happy to debate this when I have time.","replies":[{"poster":"Diablo","date":"2015-05-12T16:16:35.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reading the posts already, I'm already scared to receive any responses, YourDrunkGranny was right in so many aspects, cleaver boosting her late game but being bad for her early, riven can't team fight. she's not reliable and easy to nuke, it's why she isn't spammed in competitive like crazy. Solo queue being competitive?!?!! that's a joke and riot knows it, 5 people who will probably disagree on everything expected to work together? that is a joke. Riven has 5 escapes? lets see, each one barely moves her, it removes any damage if she tries to run with them, it's preventable by cc in a sense it will stop qs from being chained and then she temporarily only has a dash and 1 q, which isn't a real escape. Champs like udyr? sion? leblanc? pretty much anyone with a movement ability are so much better for escape in many more scenarios. Yes riven has her scenarios for escape, but there's so much better in the game, EVEN though hers is pretty good. But because for her to be relevant by needing to build AD, she needs these \"escapes\" for survivability, so it's essentially self-balanced. \"She is used in competitive gaming, thats what solo que is. Riven can be kited but she has a stun thats like on a .00001 second CD. Also if you cant play a riven into a Teemo Fioraor an Irelia then maybe she isnt the champ for you :)\" are you serious? you can play riven into temo firoa and irelia, but you start at a disadvantage with your high skill vs someone with no skill. A plat riven can easily be destroyed by a gold teemo, fiora, or irelia if they actually know what they're doing. her stun has no range to it, and is hard to hit effectively unless running at the champ, when you're running away, it's very hard to hit the stun without getting hit by damage first. So many champions with modified AA's that gain barely any range, like a garen silence, will out range it. She already isn't strong in this meta, and there are so many better ways to change her, but if you nerf her, you'll be kicking a dead horse, so why not kick the live horse and nerf hecarim? wait you did, thank you for doing something good!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Darth Pixy Misa","date":"2015-05-07T04:37:41.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"What if the best way to fix Riven was to Reduce her damage and make her tankier?\n\nBoost her Hp regen to 5.7(.6 per level)\n\nDecrease Broken Wings to\n1st and 2nd deals 10/25/45/60/80 (+30/35/40/45/50% Attack Damage) physical damage to all units she comes in contact with.\n3rd Use: Leaps forward and slams the ground dealing 10/25/45/60/80 (+30/35/40/45/50% Attack Damage) physical damage.\n\nBuff Valor to\nRiven does a quick dash in the direction of your cursor and becomes shielded, blocking up to 90/120/150/180/210 (+100% bonus Attack Damage) incoming damage for 3 seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2015-05-07T05:42:03.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably not the best plan. Giving the shield a short duration is useful because it has a low cooldown and a high potential value, so she has to time it right in order to get use out of it. Low HP regeneration exacerbates her need to use the shield properly during the laning phase. Buffing both of those up will make her a significantly more oppressive laner, and the lowered AD ratio isn't going to address the problem. Then, she'd just be weaker in the late game, without really getting any increased durability to shift her playstyle.\n\nIf anything, I'd shift her to be a bit more reliant on the shield to stay healthy. Make her squishier and easier to burst, but still allow the potential for her to absorb that damage into the shield if she has good timing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sythriel Draken","date":"2015-05-07T04:22:01.889+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I agree. They are going about these nerfs in the wrong way.  her movement and projectile speed isn't the issue, what's the issue is the cooldown on her dash.

If you have an issue with the CD on her dash, then it sounds an issue with her mobility.  They're nerfing her mobility.  If she moves more slowly, then her dashes have less impact.  Furthermore, she got a huge buff from the changes to the Black Cleaver.  That thing gives her so many good stats and it made her even more mobile than she was before.
