I remember when Riot was talking about how they were updating the coding for projectiles, that Yasuo's Windwall was a projectile in it of itself.

I have many games with Yauso under my belt, and I've had more than a  few mirror matches where both my opponent and myself have done the W+Q cancel at point blank range.
