Any other suggestions? Tryed flushing dns, setting up new portforward ips.. So yea, please riot or someone else, that has this problem and had fix for it, tell me. Thanks.\nI forgot to mention that, after several minutes it logs me in, but I still cant do anything. Cant start a game, cant see my missions and etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-06-29T22:54:54.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, this one seems kinda tricky since it's letting you in after a while but still won't let you do anything. \n\nAs I understand you, sometimes League won't start at all, and when it does the Play button or the tabs for your profile and collection just don't work, right? Can you tell me exactly or give me a screenshot of any of the error messages you're getting? That might be able to help me identify what's causing these problems. ^^","replies":[]}]}
