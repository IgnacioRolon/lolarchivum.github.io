I cannot login, and it says \"Unable to connect to the login queue. Check the server status here, if it looks good then follow the guide\" (and the guide is the link above). Anyone else having this problem? The WIERDEST thing about this, is I actually logged in once successfully but I by accident logged into my wrong account so I had to exit, and I cant get back in xD\nAny help?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-11T20:20:43.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From looking over the boards it looks like there might have been some slight issue with the login servers earlier today.
