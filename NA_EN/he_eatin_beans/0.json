Lissandra did her best, but wasn't full health when the battle started, and because of Riven getting herself killed, lost most of her chance to kill a tank, a class that already does well versus mages (outside of standard laning procedure). \n\nDo I think Tahm needs nerfs? Yeah, hit his AS or Q-delay, maybe give him a little something later in the game to make up for the fact that he can drop like a dead rock. Do I think the enemy team made a lot of mistakes in facing him, in their ability to know when to fight, or when to not go back in? Yes.

However, I've seen countless TKs wreck top lane and then do nothing for the rest of the game. So I think a lot of this has to do with people not liking to lose lane even if it means they will win the game anyway. Nerfing TK would just lead to a different lane bully taking his place. There was a time when picking Renekton top was guaranteed to win you the lane.

He actually makes the game unplayable and unfun because he shits on anyone top lane which is mind numblying absurd. its absolute bullshit not even sorry for the language because you dont even need to be good at the game to win as him.\n\nDarius stomps on TK. Mordekaiser stomps on TK. Galio is a good counterpick to TK.\n\nKarma top is an absolute counter to TK. Kayle is an easy lane into TK if you don't int early.\n\nFiora will counter TK.\n\nSome of you people exaggerate so much. TK is a gimmick win lane early become useless mid to late game champ.

I left out Akali because she actually takes brain cells to play.\n\nI also in another thread mentioned Garen, especially if you rush MR and save W for his Q so you barely get slowed and can just kite out as you poke him with QE over and over till he's in all in execute range.\n\nBut people will whine regardless. I'd rather face a TK any day over a half competent Darius, Irelia, Riven or Morde. All those scale far better, tear up teamfights, and can 1v2 rather competently while TK is absolutely useless against ganks since he has no escapes, no burst heals, and only single target damage.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
