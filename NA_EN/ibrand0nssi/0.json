Be warned that further offenses of this nature can cause you to receive a permanent suspension.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to let me know any other questions or concerns that you may have.\r\n\r\nGunny\r\nRiot Games Player Support&quot;\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\nStill no examples or anything that breaks the Terms of Service or Summoners Code. So if I am in a game with toxic people playing off meta (in casual mind you) and get reported I am going to be punished? I am curious if anyone can clarify what what the actual rules are and what to do because it sounds like I need to communicate with them even if they are toxic.\r\n\r\nHowever another Riot employee told me this\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n&quot; I recommend just muting players you are having issues with and refrain from saying negative comments or arguing with them to avoid receiving reports/punishments in the future.\r\n\r\nBroken Blade\r\nRiot Player Support\r\nPlayer Behavior and Game&quot;\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\nSo what am I suppose to do mute them and get banned for not talking to toxic individuals or talk with them become tilted as they ruin the game?\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE the one game he mentioned I was a jungle Teemo and I remember this game because my entire team was toxic and reported me for AFK yet I was farming, ganking and killing enemies. \r\nI knew this was going to be the only example the could present but if they watched the gameplay replay, or even looked at post game results they would see  I clearly was playing. The only thing I did that maybe could be a problem was I was joking about being a permaward since they were being toxic. But in that time I was able to hide and help my team by stopping them from getting baron with shrooms and poke running.\r\n\r\nNow Yes I get it that they go off of an automated report system but the gameplay replays are available so why do they not watch them and see that the report is not valid?","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-04-23T01:44:21.621+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only way to sort this out is to keep talking to the player support specialist in your ticket. You can explain to him the purpose of your actions, and they can see what happened and verify it. I believe your punishment *was* done after a manual review though, as the automated system that handles AFK behavior issues Leaver Penalties (loss of LP and a queue timer), not bans.
