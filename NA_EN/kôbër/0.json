I am forced to constantly uninstall and reinstall league to get the game to update and it keeps getting more and more annoying. It will hit 33% then fail and tell me to check the logs. I'm not a coding expert so I have no idea what I'm looking for in these logs. After i hit retry it calculated differences then fails up update again. Rinse and repeat. Anyone know how to fix it without having to uninstall/reinstall constantly?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-06T18:07:56.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the screenshot and information, that gave a lot of context to help!  At this phase, the patcher is downloading files to update your game but is being blocked.  This is usually due to a bad or slow connection problem failing to grab those assets.  I recommend going over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot and fix this for good!
