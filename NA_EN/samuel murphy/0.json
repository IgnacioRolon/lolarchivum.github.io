After just a few waves I had forced him out of lane twice I was up a level or two and I was up by a good amount of CS. Then randomly for the first time in over a year I got the dreaded &quot;Attempting to reconnect&quot; popup and the {{champion:45}} auto attacked me to death while I stood there motionless (according to my buddies on coms with me).\r\n\r\nI reconnected a few minutes later. Behind him in CS, down a level and 1 kill behind. And honestly pretty dang annoyed. \r\n\r\nFrom there I died 5 more times, forgot to ward the river and misjudged his DMG time and again. \r\n\r\nThis isnt to say I dont have games where I go 0/6 at the end of laning. But I am good about warding and when I am behind I rarely go for kills in lane unless I have help. \r\n\r\nI am usually good about &quot;Its just a game&quot; but I just kept taking it personally. Crazy how much tilt can impact your game.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-08-24T21:02:28.522+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMO it is much worse when it is a factor outside your own control, like networking or someone playing darius.
