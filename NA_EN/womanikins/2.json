When I play i try reconnecting cause there are times where I'm lagging all game until I reconnect. People might say, it's to prevent people from leaving game. First off, no it won't. Secondly people can just alt tab the game if they want to avoid 5 seconds. So why not get rid of it entirely?","replies":[]}
