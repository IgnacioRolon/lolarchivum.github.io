Sometimes when your fighting someone or chasing someone and you Q it does not work. I am definitely in range as my character is auto attacking the player, but even if I button mash my keyboard to death he will not use his Q. Can you please fix this bug, it happens a lot and I was speaking to other players and it happens to them as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Iha Ziharo","date":"2014-10-17T01:05:34.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/jmEkBsUm-warwicks-skills-lock-up-for-10-20-s-after-ult-finishes\n\nthere are three different threads linked in the thread above about the same bug.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iha Ziharo","date":"2014-10-17T01:03:56.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"apparently we can't bump posts in this new forums / boards\n\ni just tried to bump my thread about the same bug... happens after i ult.  can't use Q or W for like 20 seconds.\n\nit's really a completely game-breaker for warwick.\n\nriot is really a fucking garbage company that does nothing about the real issues in the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klagor","date":"2014-10-16T19:13:00.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think What happens is that when using your abilities just before you use your ult, they do not go on cooldown visually.  So it looks like the ability can be used, but it's actually still on cooldown.  It is a bug, and it is annoying.  :(","replies":[]}]}
