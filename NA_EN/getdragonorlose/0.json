As support I want to do as many hits in shortest possible time to upgrade Frost Fang, which top lane vs melee is much better to do than bot lane. As Zilean i give my passive Xp to team mate, so technically we don't lose Xp in 2v1 top lane. \n\nIt's kinda meta breaking, so is there any official rule that i can't go sup top lane , as some people call it \"trolling\" and \"report troll\" ?","replies":[]}
