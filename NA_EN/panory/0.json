(and I'm a completionist so giving up that premade icon hurt me a bit)\n\nI mean, they state in their ask riot that mission who force you to play off role, lower your chance of succes or straigh up ask you too much to complete them (predefinite order + premade without public chat + 6/7 only hard mode mission) are mission player don't like.\nWhy the hell would they push a batch of mission with only those kind of annoying ones :s","replies":[]},{"poster":"alaskaneagle","date":"2017-09-18T22:58:24.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"54367\n\nSaw this bug before but after we played again it was counted.
