I&#039;ve created a lot of skin concepts before (and will continue doing so when possible), but I recently wanted to try out some visual update sketches. Some of these are SUPER rough and sketchy, but these are for fun and practice. \r\n\r\nI could have done more drastic design changes for some champs (Taric, Pantheon, Urgot, Eve), but for now the sketches I did mostly have minor edits/changes. Should certain champs be changed in major areas like Sion, or have they built a legacy/fanbase that their original theme, attire, and portrayal are important (but tidied up and more streamlined to match the current aesthetic). It differs for each champ.\r\n\r\nHow epicly awesome should Cho&#039;Gath be without being too complicated (animation, number of new models needed, and so on), considering all of his other skins would have to receive the same treatment. His body/carapace could consist of segmented plates that allow him to expand and grow when he feasts. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope you enjoy the sketches! They&#039;re not perfect by any means, but exploring is fun! Taric&#039;s first sketch looks waaayy too similar to Jarvan, the colors for Caitlyn are kind of a mess, BUT HEY feel free to give your input.\r\n\r\nIf you wanted to check out my other work, my deviantart: http://vegacolors.deviantart.com/\r\n\r\nTake care, everyone!","replies":[{"poster":"Ironclad Dragon","date":"2015-08-10T19:20:12.587+0000","up_votes":81,"down_votes":0,"body":"This art... these modernizations...\nhttps://michaelscomments.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/dis.jpg?w=460","replies":[{"poster":"General Keith","date":"2015-08-10T23:12:41.301+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"Upvoted for Ice Cream Sandwich.","replies":[{"poster":"MeesterMoo","date":"2015-08-11T05:53:34.092+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Upvoted for relevant meme","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TheFirstGokun","date":"2015-08-10T19:55:20.259+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"The kind-of-cloaked-but-not-really Evelynn makes me so happy, and I love how you kept the hair but gave it a new twist.

I feel like it looks too high-tech. Too much Zaun, not enough Noxus.\n\nThat said, the rest of those are all amazing and I would be very happy with any one of them. I especially like the LeBlanc, particularly the left one. It's amazing how much classier and more threatening she looks when she's wearing something resembling actual clothing. The Evelynn is very nice too. I like what you did with her hair. It looks really ethereal, which helps to sell her shadow isles origins.\n\nThe Cho'Gath I... actually don't know how I feel about it? He looks badass and cool, but for some reason I also feel like he reminds me too much of Baron or a minion. He looks less like a playable champ and more like an objective boss fight. But maybe that's the point? 6 stack Cho SHOULD feel that way.

The surface of the plates shouldn't be smooth is what I'm trying to express. Cho'Gath represents terror, there is nothing smooth about him, his character is terrifying, so his physical self (I feel) should reflect that terror.\n\nUrgotVU just wouldn't work. He's too sleek and smooth. His lore is that he was a butcher in war, ruthless and probably sociopathic. From Noxus. He is reanimated as a zombie weapon, similar to Sion, and the techmaturgists who worked on him are from Zaun. They won't care if he looks crap or ugly. He is a living weapon and he must be effective at murdering people, nothing else. He had a revolting, murderous personality in life and in death he should be just as much.\n\nThese are just my take on the characters in relation to your VU.","replies":[{"poster":"Ze Ocelot","date":"2015-08-12T23:02:51.329+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks so much for the feedback!

I actually want to keep those parts of him intact, especially because of his lore, but my sketch is too simple to show the ugly side, lacking in textures.
