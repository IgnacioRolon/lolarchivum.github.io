It&#039;s ending in a few days though\n\n_**I went to Gamestop last week and traded in games in my garage I was never going to touch again and made $600.** _\n\nNormally, Gamestop rips you off when it comes to trade-ins, but you can legit get pretty good values off this deal if you&#039;re looking to get games this year, since trading for Gamestop credit gives you more value than trading for cash credit. Oh yeah, if you want pure cash, you don&#039;t get the 60-70%.\n\nYou need a pro membership to go from 60% bonus to 70% bonus, but I just asked them if I could use the credit I made off the trade-ins to buy the membership, giving me the extra ten percent despite me not owning the membership walking in.\n\nCertain games trade-in for quite a lot, sometimes even MORE than you can buy, notably:\n\nPvZ :Garden Warfare 2 ~$47\nShadow of Mordor GOTY ~$32\nAmazing Spiderman 2 ~32\nNeed for Speed (PS4 ONLY) ~$32\nNeed for Speed Rivals (PS4 ONLY) ~$32\n\nIf you&#039;re especially crafty you can basically make money off this trade, plenty of people have been buying out the games from other retailers and then trading them in for more at Gamestop. But they might be catching on since there are a few reports of Gamestops not taking the above due to the absurd trade-in.\n\nNintendo games, especially Pokemon Mainline games and Fire Emblem games (DON&#039;T TRADE THE GAMECUBE ONES), go for quite a bit as well. Heartgold by itself was about $40~ trading in. Some newer games obviously are close to their original value as well, if you don&#039;t want them but can&#039;t sell them off ebay or something.\n\nSo if you got stuff rotting in your garage, Gamestop gives you a decent worth of money. \n\nWhat does all this mean? Absolutely fucking nothing because the Switch is still out of stock.","replies":[]}
