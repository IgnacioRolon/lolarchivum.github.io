It is true the AP is wasted, but look beyond that and realize just how powerful the active is by itself. At first glance, it's quite strong, but not enough to warrant 3.1k gold.\n\nHowever Garen's ultimate scales very strangely, having a large base damage as well as missing health scaling. The missing health scaling scales with the % amplification as well. I supplied the math on my guide, won't go over it here because lolphone.\n\nYou're looking at 1.5k magic damage to a standard ADC not counting MR. That's a LOT for two buttons that are single targeted spells AT A RANGE COMING FROM AN BRUISER/TANK LIKE GAREN. (Level 16 ultimate)\n\nAgainst tanks? You can delete tanks who dive into YOUR ADC, making GAREN an excellent tank killer as well.\n\nThe AP is wasted, but the gold is not. DFGaren shines late game, where normal Garens flop. It's not just for the surprise factor.

Garen doesn't need attack speed. The crit doesn't hurt, but AD is much more valuable because it boosts the damage of his two other damaging skills.\n\nBlack Cleaver+DFG+I Edge gives DFG Garen the maximum damage output while being able to take in two tank items.\n\nHere's an alternative build if you're feeling ballsy however:\n\nBlack Cleaver, DFG, Infinity Edge, Stattik Shiv, Trinity Force, Sorc Shoes. Maximum damage. You are glass, and they are waiting to be smashed.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"7ha7guy777","date":"2014-10-23T18:46:04.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"don't forget DFG gives cooldown reduction","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rozzeta","date":"2015-01-31T16:59:32.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't you see all those Lee Sin Kills?
