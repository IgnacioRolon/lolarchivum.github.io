Riot please update this.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dear Riot.\r\n I have a 27\" 4k monitor and I simply find it too hard to play league now. The health bars are too tiny. Also the biggest issue is the cursor. I cannot even see it in team fights and it's really hard to farm. Please try and see if you could  do something about this as I'm sure other people have this issue as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-14T21:33:47.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're looking at implementing full 4K support, but in the meantime, there is basic 4K support. One of the biggest issues at the moment is that if you play in Full Screen mode and Alt+Tab, it causes your UI scaling to get fudged up. Try testing in a custom match to see if that was what's been causing the issue for you.","replies":[]}]}
