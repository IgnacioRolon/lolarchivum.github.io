I lead with questions to ensure the feedback I'm giving is actually in line with the values we may or may not share.\n\nFor example, my mother used to hound me every day about becoming a doctor. She'd ask me, \"Why aren't you taking this class, don't you want to be a doctor?\" or \"If you're going to be a doctor, you shouldn't do that.\" It got to the point where she had a mini-intervention with me to discuss why I wasn't listening to her feedback. At that point I had to tell her I wanted to be a writer and had been shaping my life according to that. After a year of convincing, she finally came around and then her suggestions and feedback actually made sense - \"Why not take this job instead, if you want to be a writer?\"\n\nIn this context, if you come in and say \"why didn't you nerf Yasuo before this patch?\" that presumes many, many things and makes it nearly impossible to engage. We have to defuse your argument based on your values before coming to our own values. The moment that happens, you say \"no, ensuring the balance of Yasuo should the #1 most important thing to your team,\" and we have to revisit why that may not be the case.\n\nOn the flip side, I'm trying - and our designers are trying - not to also lead with opinions but to ask why you might be scared or concerned about something. It could be there's a deeper reason and we can adjust for that, rather than the superficial one. Finally, all of these guys have years and years of experience working on games, and they draw from those for their own conclusions. Most players - and this is a blanket statement - draw from their very personal experience. No player is 'worried' about the holistic fun of the game.

It would be appreciated. A lot of players, including myself, don't necessarily have that trust in Riot. Trusting someone's decision making because of their intentions is a poor choice because the two are not linked; the ability to make a good decision over a bad one is not the same as the ability to know which decision is good and which is bad. A lot of us have especially been burned by ChampUp, where trusting someone's intentions can leave a champ in a poor state for months and months.\n\nSince you want us to outline our assumptions before we ask questions, I'll lay out mine. I proceed under the assumption that the general balance between AP and AD has been fairly good for the past couple of seasons. Mages were seen. ADCs were always seen. We are a ways from league of cleavers. The efficiency-pass through that has functionally buffed AD and functionally nerfed AP occurred because I believe Riot said that AP items were very efficient. Where is the disconnect here? That seems (and appears to be born out) a sure-fire way to put the game in a state of imbalance.","replies":[{"poster":"Xypherous","date":"2015-11-12T23:16:41.786+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":">  I proceed under the assumption that the general balance between AP and AD has been fairly good for the past couple of seasons.\n\nI don't believe this is true once you look at it under the lens of game impact.\n\nConsider the consistent player sentiment across seasons: Your mid-lane is incredibly impactful and likely carries your game. AD carries are frustrating when fully farmed but feel like they lack agency throughout most of the game.\n\nWhile players have brought up several decent reasons for why this is true (scaling / the impact of mid-lane) - it seems very likely that this effect could also be simply produced by the fact that, on a raw gold basis - mages were simply getting more out of early gold.\n\nThe other portion of this that I typically struggle with is that **class** imbalances tends to be a matter of perspective more so than actual balance.  \n\nThat is, people have a view of how the mage vs. carry fight should play out.  This view can be significantly different from player to player but because each class is more -or- less mandatory - class imbalances are largely unaffected by win-rate until they start completely replacing the core functions of another class. \n\n(For example, Cleaver made AP obsolete - because you no longer needed mixed damage to function well.  Likewise, any super melee hybrid defense/offense meta tends to make ranged entirely obsolete.)\n\nTherefore, whatever the current state of the game is **tends** to be perceived as good from a class balance perspective - whether it's true or not.\n\n> That seems (and appears to be born out) a sure-fire way to put the game in a state of imbalance.\n\nLuckily, due to some of the above factors, class imbalances are actually fairly robust to changes like this as the change needs to be extreme enough to make it so that another class can replace said class entirely.\n\nBecause most classes have a core function that is very difficult to replace - classes tend to have a lot more 'sticking' power even when the class in question is factually weak.  The prevailing thought among the AD curve currently is that the previous ADC curves are weak but mandatory - and thus, despite needing to pick both an AD and an AP carry - their respective power relative to one another is one forged from necessity of mixed damage types and tower sieging rather than actual balance between their power ratios.\n\nThat is, because ADC's aren't optional - you can make them as weak as you can - people will still bring them due to sieging.  Like-wise with the support/tank etc.  Therefore, you can be in a state where AP is incredibly strong and AD incredibly weak and still see a high prevalence of AP vs. AD.\n\nLikewise - you can't stack damage sources of a single type and expect to get away with it - thus some source of magic damage will always be required.\n\nThat's not to say that this state is good or anything - just that it tends to be harder to change.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-11-12T23:20:32.362+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"ADCs shouldn't get agency if they're keeping their high end power.\n\nYeah, I realize that's rough to say, but it's true.

I agree that ADCs aren't optional but would say that there is no other class besides ADC that can't be replaced by something else. We have had League of Assassins where there wasn't a Mage in sight. You can replace tanks with disengage (you can't lump tanks and Janna together in the same group like you kind of implied by saying support/tank). You can replace AP mages with wholesale with assassins (generally AD) or even caster ADCs like Varus in the mid lane. You cannot replace ADCs because as you noted they are needed for tower destruction. It's just not true that other classes have sticking power. And I don't think ADCs can ever be satisfactory until they are replaceable. There needs to be a trade-off made. Every class in LoL has an effect that can be replicated or mitigated by choosing a different class except for ADCs. Mages poke, lock down, burst. All of those effects can be replicated to lesser or greater degrees by other roles. No other role takes towers.\n\n **Mages are not the same thing as mid lane.** Mid is influential because it is, literally, mid. In the geography of the map, the middle lane controls positional access to each side. Knock down the mid tower and the enemy jungle is open. No change to ADCs will change this. The player in mid - either assassin Mage or Yasuo - is able to roam top or bot because of their geography. No change to ADCs short of allowing them to pick teleport will stop this. The player in the middle lane *should* be the more impactful because their performance has a larger impact on the overall strategic flow of the game.\n\nI fundamentally don't think that ADCs should not have much agency because the dream of 1v5 is an unhealthy one. They should always be reliant on their teams. They are supposed to be the sustained damage dealer. They should only have high damage output over extended periods of time. They should not be duelists - dueling requires either burst damage or a way to avoid damage, both of which increase agency. There should not be a point in any game where the ADC just has enough gold to kill everything. Mage agency beyond unloading a combo - once they are on cooldown they have to run. ADC players don't feel the same pressure because autoattacks are essentially always up. Because they don't have that same moment of real powerlessness that is a Mage fully on cooldown, they don't feel like they need to rely on their team the same way. ADCs need clearer windows to feel agency.\n\nEDIT: a rephrase I thought of that is perhaps a hit clearer: ADC players might not feel much agency because I doubt many of them see tower taking as their primary job. They probably see their primary job as killing everything in the fight. Since they are the only class that can take towers, they will always revolve around this fact. If an identity isn't replaceable then they are balanced to some degree around this lowest common denominator. They need to have clear multiple roles that don't just involve killing everything (because that's not a healthy fantasy for the other players in the game) and be the only class that can take towers (because that limits what else they can be allowed to do).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2015-11-12T22:45:27.427+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, thanks for the reply!\n\n>On the flip side, I'm trying - and our designers are trying - not to also lead with opinions but to ask why you might be scared or concerned about something.

This also means most questions that actually contain value usually also contain an opinion of sorts (as most informed questions stem from experience/knowledge and not just to fill a void from my point of view). So i agree that leading with opinions would in fact be tyranny of sorts - instead i think it´s important to voice ones opinions and listen to others to then maybe reflect upon it and find a consensus. So opinion sort of is the beginning of all conversation - if you don´t have any opinions, how would you be able to reflect upon an answer in the first place?\n\n- While players usually draw from their personal experience - for a lot of players this refers to more than a decade of gaming, so it´s a rather vast experience - and ultimatly most designers can only do the same (sure, they are a little more informed about the design in general and underlying issues - but the goal for both is most of the times the same - to create a great game that is fun to play - as a whole, not only because abusing a single champ might be fun for a week). You´ll find badly informed decissions on both sides, but all in all i think there´s a lot of valuable feedback from playerside (though sometimes hidden in a lot of frustration)...and not much of it seems to get the attention it deserves, if any at all.","replies":[{"poster":"PWYFF","date":"2015-11-13T00:18:45.624+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":6,"body":"So I think where the misinterpretation stems from - and I can correct in the future - is between having an opinion or enforcing an opinion.\n\nThe sentiment I'm going for with \"no opinions as questions\" is more along the lines of: please don't make demands, or frame demands as questions, because that's not a discussion, that's a negotiation.\n\nI would love for people to have opinions and to present them with the intention of discussion, rather than the intention of hostility. I know that some people don't intend for that but still come off as hostile, but that's where education comes in. I won't just abide by \"well, just answer the question\" because if you've seen any of Greg's (Ghostcrawler) discussions, they often start out hostile and aggressive while he mediates. I just don't think that's healthy and it doesn't teach anyone manners.\n\nSo we agree that opinions are good, and I like opinions that want to be challenged or investigated. I'll clarify that rather than be snarky.\n\nFor the second point, I see your point but I'll challenge you on the concept of mindfulness. As a player, I am focused on my desires, my wants, and what makes a fun game **to me**. I love action games with any form of customizatin or progression, I love deep RPGs, I am getting used to CCGs, I dislike straight action games like Super Meat Boy but I believe it's a fantastic game for what it is.\n\nWith a game like League, people like it for a variety of reasons and I want to make those reasons clear and understood by all parties before we get to discussion. We all want to create a great game that's fun - but League is fun to us in different ways. I love the combination of strategic and tactical elements, but some people just want to sit top and beat the shit out of someone. That's a lens.\n\nSo yes people can draw from their experiences and talk about their desires in relation to their experiences - I love that. I think not everyone is trained or used to examining why they love what they love, or what lies behind their enjoyment of a game.

So not really knowing what you yourself want to achieve sort of makes it a little hard to give you the feedback you´d need - leaving a lot of vague formulated anecdotes about what feels fun and what doesn´t. \nSo well, while i believe it might be really hard to fish for good advice in an infinite ocean of player-opinions...maybe a little more clarity from your side could go a long way here? \nt´s fine and nice to let the community ask questions about anything, but ultimatly i think it´s not all that enlightening - so why don´t you try it the other way and ask the community about more specific feedback on things you struggle with (or are proud of)? - I don´t think it hurts to not only have the developer perspective but also see the game a little more with the actual players eyes (and even if you ultimatly reject most of the input, every reflection can lead to unexpected breakthroughs).","replies":[{"poster":"PWYFF","date":"2015-11-13T01:18:19.317+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Absolutely on your points!

You can almost guarantee you'll win the game provided you can drag it out for 15-20 minutes after it's mostly decided... and since you're ahead, avoiding fights that aren't crushingly in your favor isn't all that hard to do.\n\nThe intent for the new system is to reverse that - if nothing significant happens, the team that is behind will tend to catch up on gold. At the same time, the team that is ahead gets more opportunities to try to press their advantage. Our goal is that games that are getting out of hand either end faster or experience a comeback faster. Overall comebacks should happen at about the same rate or possibly a bit more often, but if this mechanic specifically reduces the number of comebacks, we have a lot of ways of increasing them without giving up on the advantages we're after with this system.\n\nI don't believe that wave manipulation is totally dead - if you're just a little bit behind, slow pushes and freezes actually work better than before, since having extra minions around far outweighs the advantage - but I do realize it's likely to be more difficult and less valuable than before, at least in snowballed games. On the other hand, rotational play, objective control, and sieging become more valuable in those games.","replies":[{"poster":"Huang Shaotian","date":"2015-11-13T00:31:08.345+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I asked this before in another thread dedicated to this topic soley but no answer. \n\nHave you given any thoughts to edge cases such as ;\n*people abusing their team mates to leave to increase/decrease their average team level? \n\n*Assuming dc's wont effect average level, games with AFKers/Trolls/Dc's being now even more impossible to win due to the inability to ever push your lane out and take objectives?\n\n*Getting your weakest player to disconnect when you're ahead to force the enemy team out of their base?\n\n*temporarily disconnect as support for a minute to force minion waves out everytime the enemy freezes?","replies":[{"poster":"qetzel","date":"2015-11-13T01:26:42.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even several thousand gold down a 4 vs 5 is almost a guaranteed loss.
