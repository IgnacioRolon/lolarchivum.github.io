Sorry!\n\n[**You can officially download Ziggs' Arcade Blast here!**](http://d3a99h1uu682xq.cloudfront.net/ZiggsArcadeBlast-0.2-64bit.zip)\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BX8qAN0jtw5/\n\n[**Read our last editorial update here!**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/thunderdome-team-pvc/VEKq8mo2-the-final-countdown-editorial-update)\n\nThanks so much to everyone who participated and helped make this game what it is. From the votes, to the late night donuts being sent to the office, to the nonstop memes, to the live playtests. \n\n48 hours ago, we had an idea and some votes. Now we have a mini-game!\n\nYou can [see our behind-the-scenes content on instagram](https://www.instagram.com/riot_thunderdome_pvc/).\n\n[We'll be hanging out in Discord all day](https://discord.gg/GgkSZvF)\n\nBelow is a full archive of our updates in chronological order.\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR**: For [Thunderdome X](http://thunderdome.riotgames.com/), a small team of Rioters - we&#039;re calling ourselves Team PVC (Player Voted Content) - are running a 48hr game jam experiment, where we&#039;ll take your votes as to what mini-game we&#039;ll build in 48 hours. Throughout this process, we&#039;ll be openly sharing developments, taking your input, and putting out a lot of fires.\n\nDevelopment and concepting run from 8/16, 12pm PDT and **end 8/18 @ 12pm PDT**.\n\nFeel free to refer back to this thread as the &quot;mega-thread&quot; of major developments and a chronological rundown of what&#039;s going on. We&#039;ll also be posting whatever else we feel like on the boards, but will notify the Discord as well.\n\n---\n\n**So what&#039;s this all about?**\n\nEvery so often at Riot Games, we run an internal, 48 hour nonstop hackathon called [&quot;Thunderdome,&quot;](http://thunderdome.riotgames.com) where any Rioter can take on any role to tackle any challenge, provided they can finish their work within 48 hours. Every year, Rioters from all over team up and jam on a wide range of inspirational projects.\n\nThis Thunderdome, a team of devs, artists, engineers, producers, and comms folks are attempting something new: a 48 hour, player-input driven game jam with open public discussion. We&#039;re calling ourselves **Team PVC** (player voted content). \n\nTypically the goal of most Thunderdome projects _isn&#039;t_ to ship something to the public, and it&#039;s important to note that this is also **not** the main goal of this team. What we&#039;re primarily experimenting with is **how open can we be with our development in a 48 hour game jam?** Our goals are to kick off some interesting player discussions, build a good base mini-game, scope creep the hell out of everything, put out the fires, and then hopefully release said game once we&#039;re done. We have no guarantees we&#039;ll hit any of these, but we can certainly try. Come chat with us as we go, and let&#039;s learn something together!\n\n---\n\n**UPDATE 8/15/2017 9:38PM PDT:**\nhttp://imgur.com/a3M8bd3\n\n---\n\n**UPDATE 8/16/2017 1:53PM PDT:**\n[Check out our full editorial update so far!](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/thunderdome-team-pvc/bmoF3cFE-brainstorming-dust-has-settled-editorial-update)\n\n**WE ARE MAKING A 2D PLATFORMING, ARCADE-THEMED MINI-GAME**\n\nAfter an intense 1hr brainstorming session to kick off Thunderdome, the team has settled on a few things:\n- **Ziggs** will be our main character\n- We'll focus on a few single-screen platforming levels vs. long side-scrolling dungeons so we can focus resources and depth of gameplay\n- WE WANT DESTRUCTION!!! but don't want to scare the engineering team with too much destruction (and bugs)\n- Ziggs is defined by tossing bombs and satchel hopping, let's try to get that in!\n- We want enemies and boss fights!\n- Ziggs vs. Brand sounds sweet\n\n---\n\n**UPDATE 8/16/2017 10:03PM PDT:**\nWe have another major update! You can check it out @ https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/thunderdome-team-pvc/sr9b8ent-end-of-day-1-recap-editorial-update\nAlso we have a working mechanics prototype, which you can check out @ https://www.instagram.com/p/BX4aPoCjq4z/\n\nTL;DR of tonight's update as we go into the 'overnight' stretch of late work is... game development is all about order of operations. Some pieces of the puzzle can get started with minimal dependencies (concepting, modelling, level design), but others are very dependent on \"selling\" their counterparts. Visuel effects (particles, ambient floaty stuff), for example, needs to be attached to an attack or an effect. Sound effects also need to see what they're being attached to, to really 'sell' the fantasy.\n\nWe're just about coming out of our first phase of newly created assets, but now we're about to enter phase 2 of really, fully fleshing out the work. Wish us luck! We'll see you tomorrow!\n\n---\n\n**UPDATE 8/17/2017 10:36AM PDT:**\nThe leads just had a meeting to assess if we could hit our 12pm \"playable build\" milestone. All signs look good, although we've still got to get enemies behavorally programmed, hooked up with VFX, and implemented. Mechanically we're looking solid, and level design is in good shape. We're also trying out bumpers, more on that later.\n\nFor now, check out some sweet level paintovers:\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BX5wUvIjRLn/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BX5z6GujS9d/\n\n---\n\n**UPDATE 8/17/2017 1:00PM PDT:**\nFull deep dive @ https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/thunderdome-team-pvc/QgB3IgLA-24-hour-check-in-fingers-crossed\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BX6F4uLDo3x/\n\nWe have a playable build! So far so good, it looks like our non-stop drive to a playable build was a success. This really lets us look at the game to understand what's working, what's not, and why. It's insanely hard to just \"think\" of a mechanic and how it'll work. Put it out, play it, and then iterate.\n\n---\n\n**UPDATE 8/17/2017 5:00PM PDT:**\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BX6d3uwjl-j/\n\nFull update @ https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/thunderdome-team-pvc/K7wepRAA-wheres-the-fun-editorial-update\n\nIt feels like it's been forever since we shipped a playable build to the whole team, but that was a mere 5 hours ago. It's impressive what a playable build has done for focus, however. With everyone running through levels and trying out mechanics, we're distilling out what works and what doesn't at a breakneck pace. Now we're at a cross-roads. \"Where's the fun?\" We need to figure out which path we want to take, whether it be an acrobatic platformer, a trick-shot run-n-gunner, an enemy horde fighter, or some combination of the above. Our next goal? 10pm, feature lock. Polish, iterate, improve the framerate (which is sadly getting rough on our minspec test computers).\n\nSecret goals? We want to try to ship a secret pre-alpha build for our discord buddies to try out and give feedback on. Let's see if we can.\n\n---\n\n**UPDATE 8/17/2017 11:47PM PDT:**\nFull update can be read @ https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/thunderdome-team-pvc/XoXIzJjo-12hrs-left-what-we-learned-when-we-shipped-a-thing-and-how-we-made-the-cut\n\nWe've been through a lot, but in just under 36 hours we were able to ship a playable, one-level alpha build to our jolly, donut-obssessed family on discord. These folks have been instrumental in providing us real-time feedback, and insatiable in their desire for donut discussion. That said, they've also sent some donuts to the campus to tide us through the night, so there's an upside here somewhere.\n\nSo far, feedback has been fantastic, thanks for sticking with us! 12 hours to go!\n\n---\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BX8bjRNjhRH/\n\no god\n\n---\n\n**UPDATE 8/18/2017 11:29PM PDT:**\nWe're compiling and waiting to see if the things we compile are broken.\n\n---\n\n**UPDATE 8/18/2017 11:40PM PDT:**\nWe hit a snag with the boss fight but don't worry things are fine everything is fine this is fine.\n\nWe're fine!\n\n---\n\n**UPDATE 8/18/2017 11:52PM PDT:**\nTwo bugs we're looking into. One, you have to mouseover the bottom half of a button for it to work (whoops). Two, the enemy counter doesn't count down when you kill things on level 2. Also whoops.\n\n---\n\n**UPDATE 8/18/2017 12:04PM PDT:**\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BX8jSxyjz2r/\n\nThe engineer and the producer.
