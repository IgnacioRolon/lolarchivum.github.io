Balance outliers like Corki, Graves, and Rageblade had stuck around for so long without meaningful changes that I was concerned that Riot was happy with them. Good to see that Riot is confronting the issues that the Boards have had the most complaints about. \n\nHowever, I'm curious as to why Riot still thinks that towers are too weak. I don't believe it's necessarily an issue with towers themselves, but in that the playerbase has gotten much better at towerdiving and juggling aggro. Wouldn't buffing a tower's first-shot damage be more important than increasing their ramp-up damage? Most players aren't under towers for more than a couple shots anyways, especially early game.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-04-06T19:54:02.964+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":0,"body":"Towers currently drop a lot of their ramped damage when they swap targets during a dive.

One thing that I feel that it is missing from them is an ap armor item. Zhonya is more fitting to burst mages and ap assassins, as they're squishy, have to commit to a target, and the invulnerability is useful not only to survive from a sudden burst, but also to wait for cooldowns to get another kill or leap back to safety. It feels like Abyssal Scepter is more appropriate both to squishy assassins, ap tanks and battle mages, as it relies on sticking closer to your target. Usually, however, I think RoA+Rilay+Liandry are the only truly good items for battle mages, while rabadon, void staff and sorcerer shoes are more bursty options that are still picked because there's no better alternatives to those sort of mages.\n\nYou may have a different idea than me, though, but it seems like battle mages are the equivalent of ap juggernauts, or close enough to it, especially the immobile battle mages.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-04-06T20:56:40.024+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"We do expect Battle Mages to build tankier on average than other mages and they'll generally have things on their kits to support that (Vlad's passive, Ryze being rewarded for building mana since mana's found on tankier items, Swain's need for mana in the same vein etc). \n\nI'd agree Battle Mages are the closest thing there is to a mage version of a juggernaut, in terms of shorter range, tougher, lower mobility, more defensive power than others in their class.","replies":[{"poster":"Nefas","date":"2016-04-06T21:00:57.436+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Might Swain (and Karthus for that matter) get any buffs since the nerfs seem to have hurt them quite a bit?

Even when she's ahead, she has a hard time killing ADCs, while newer roles like juggernauts completely invalidate her (she can never kill them, and since she has to get up close to deal damage, they can kill her very easily.)\n\nI can see why people play her as a tank, even though that's completely \"wrong\" to me - it's because she's just not good enough at assassination to fill the role she was originally designed for.\n\nI'd love to see her refocused more towards an assassin again.

It feels to me like there's a lot more to it than just towers being too weak or other objectives not being worth enough. It seems that the team that initiates the swap has all the advantages, and the only option left for the other team is to do the exact same thing or fall too far behind.

Pro play does often favor taking the safe, equalizing play when available (you go for our outer tower, we go for yours). We have in the past seen Dragon be a major driver of early conflict when the reward's been sufficient though, with teams prioritizing taking it over towers. Smaller objectives also have some value there as a way to help create situations where 'just go for one of their towers' isn't so often the correct response.\n\nRisk defending towers is the other lever we're looking at. As player skill's got better, both in pro and regular play, towers have become increasingly dangerous to defend, with good agro juggling especially allowing much earlier safe ish dives. That means that defending a tower while outnumbered's the wrong choice more often than it should be. Our first step there's going to be making tower damage ramp harder, particularly when they're swapping targets, making dives riskier and defense therefore a bit more appealing. We're also looking into whether minion damage against towers early on's potentially too high, resulting in pushes that grind through a tower too quickly early game (as with agro juggling players have also gotten a lot better at wave manipulation over time).\n\nIf putting sufficient power into other objectives, stronger tower ramp and potentially better defense against minion damage isn't sufficient to create a more dynamic early game we'll then look into other options. Not certain as to details yet, that'll depend on how those changes go. I'd expect additional work to make it more practical and rewarding to defend towers early to be where we start though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SuperLuigiLXIV","date":"2016-04-06T19:40:23.192+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably not going to see this get much attention, but...\n\nWhy does Aatrox still pay health costs on his Q and E? Furthermore, why are they % costs?\n\nOther champions who pay health costs have far more reliable ways to regain that health. It's not possible to stop Vlad from using his Q--he might not use it on YOU, but he'll just as happily drain a minion to pay for his stuff. Mordekaiser pays flat health but also gains a percentage of the damage he does as a shield, and he does a LOT of damage--the Q alone pays for itself many times over. Mundo's entire kit works around regeneration, and to top that off, he gets health refunded on his most spammable ability so long as it lands--which, frankly, is not that hard. Zac can be bullied off his bloblets by the right champions, but he pays less than Aatrox and his kit allows him to build resistances, making it less dangerous for him to be at lower amounts of health.\n\nBut Aatrox? He pays % health costs, but his regen mechanic is a flat amount based on his AD. This makes health a TERRIBLE stat to build on him. At the same time, he's essentially a melee-range ADC, and is extremely reliant on auto attacks to get anything done, but he has a much harder time both approaching and sticking to champions than his fellow divers Tryndamere, Yi, Wukong, Vi. Xin, and Yasuo. He does less damage than them, he's squishier than they are, he requires too many stats compared to them, and to top all that off, he can neither approach nor escape as well as they do. The ONE thing he's got going for him is that he has mixed AoE damage from his E and R, and that is clearly not enough.\n\nI don't know how to fix Aatrox without a full rework.

Some mages just want to make use of their lv6 power spike as soon as they can (current state malzahar) or get to their core items as fast as possible (like rilay on current malzahar/ aurelion sol), before grabbing the much needed mana items. So mana items would make perfect sense as second items for them, if it wasn't for the fact that they need to built up and you're kind of forced to pick them first.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sealvester","date":"2016-04-06T19:40:52.916+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sure it's on your guys' radar right now but at the moment the Grasp+Sunfire+IBG combo is a serious issue.  The fact that so many champions that aren't even supposed to build tanky, (Ekko, Jayce, I've even watched Tank Shaco) can build this way and still do a large amount of damage is just not OK.  \n\nIt's fine for tanks to be a real threat and all, but right now they are just way way way too powerful because of how cheap and efficient their build path is, and seeing grasp+cape+IBG is making top lane extremely stale.\n\nAt least do something about grasp, it feels like it's crowding out other keystone options in top lane.\n\nOther than that I think the game isn't too far from being unbalanced.
