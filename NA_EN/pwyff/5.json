Here, post your questions here and I'll tell you if they're interesting. Hah.\n\n\nI have a question about the Deathfire's Touch mastery, if you don't mind. It seems to me that the idea behind DFT is that poke champs would excel with it, whereas more combo oriented mages would prefer Thunderlord's Decree, for the added burst in their spell rotations. There's a problem, though, in my opinion, in that DFT inhibits the abilities of some of our League's best poke champions. Xerath, Ziggs, Vel'Koz, Karma, Lux, Corki, Kog'Maw. All of these champions' primary poke spells are AOE, and thus only gain half of the bonus from DFT. This means that these champions (with the exception of Vel, who clearly should take TLD) blow their Keystone on something weaker than a Luden's Echo proc! It just seems so counter-intuitive to the spirit of the mastery's design. \n\nAt this point, the mastery's full potential (i.e. single target damage abilities on a 3s cooldown) is limited to Ezreal, Gangplank, Kennen, Ryze, and Teemo. Only Ezreal among them really embodies a poke champion.\n\nSo my question is this, do you feel that this should be changed, perhaps by removing the aoe limitation but adding a cooldown? If not, why? If this mastery is not intended for poke champions, who is it intended for? There are few single target poke spells to begin with, and most of them aren't on champions that would usually prefer this mastery to begin with.","replies":[{"poster":"PWYFF","date":"2015-11-14T01:33:30.001+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":5,"body":"So this is definitely, 100%, a super leading question.\n\nAnyway.\n\nYour comment that DFT inhibits the abilities of some of League's best poke champions I'm not sure if we're seeing the same thing. It's an additive 'burn' to champions on all of their poke abilities. The loss of a single-target damage burn is compensated by the fact that aoe-damage is insanely efficient as a spell-to-cost-to-damage ratio. You're only looking at it from a single-target burst damage / burn perspective and that's very odd to me. So personally I don't feel it should be changed because then the design space absolutely overlaps with Thunderlord's Decree. One is a single-target focused burst mechanic with aoe implications, the other is specifically intended for either constant applicable damage or an aoe-burn application.","replies":[{"poster":"Wisenheimer","date":"2015-11-14T01:54:00.203+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the main problem people seem to have is that even if DFT is good it doesn't feel good, similar to the problem liandry's suffers from or used to suffer from.

Just wondering if there's any chance for some variety (and not everything to build out of Zeal)\n\nI think you may be asking for variety for the sake of variety. Right now component items heavily signal intent in terms of upgrading purchases, and the challenge we faced (and talked about in our dev blogs) was that marksmen just want one thing: damage. In pursuit of that, multiplicative damage is pretty much the best way they can stay relevant in the game, meaning crit becomes a difficult stat to 'pull out.' If we were to add new items, they'd have to be meaningful enough to compete with crit as a desirable stat, meaning we'd have to figure out how to offer what marksmen want (damage) in a different way. Impossible? Definitely not. A goal worth pursuing at the cost of other opportunities? I wonder!\n\n>Why is the Oracle Alteration (almost) the same color as Sweeping Lens? Farsight Alteration changes the color.\n\nBecause I think the sweeping mechanic is shared by both and so having the two share thematic coloring makes sense from that capacity. Farsight was colored blue for its initial overlap with CV (rest in pepperonis). Once again, coloring for the sake of unique coloring I'm not sure if it's worth the investment.\n\n>While talking about colors: why is Eye of the Equinox in a different color scheme than Relic Shield and Targon's Brace? Other eyestones share the color pattern with their GP10 component.\n\nI think we went for the core thematic - a shield - but perhaps didn't feel beholden to green. \n\n>Are there any plans to add new (tank?) items to deal with stealthed champions? Some of them got exponentially scarier in the lategame, when there's no room for pinks in the equipment. Something skillshot-based, or on-attack, perhaps?\n\nBecause I just sent out an email on this: Removing true sight was a deliberate decision because, ultimately, stealth champions have their power budget allocated to being difficult to detect. Giving 'standardized' counters that everyone gets for free  means the champion's just kind of... not stealthed after a certain period of time. With the trinket changes, sweeper still detects bodies and we want to see a world where a stealth champion's 'power' of stealth comes with the ability to conceal their health. If player adjustment is a hard - \"we must buy pink wards\" - to the point where it becomes mandatory to play against stealth champions, we'll fix accordingly. But if players understand this and know how to work with sweepers, maybe we won't need to.\n\n>Immobile mages like Vel'Koz, Malzahar and Lux have been sitting at low pick rate and high winrate for quite some time right now.

We'd love to see how everything is shaking out rather than gut reacting to things that immediately appear too weak or too strong.\n\n>What would you do if suddenly the meta made the ADC class entirely optional just like the other classes (tanks, mages, assassins) are?\nIs the topic of not-necessarily-ADC meta a point of reference in balance discussions at all?\n\nRather than discussing it by symptoms (\"what happens if ADCs are only played in the jungle?\") we'd like to understand the implications of a change like that. Marksmen don't suddenly get phased out for no reason - there's a cascading number of effects (ie: \"taking turrets is no longer difficult for anyone, even inhibitors\" or \"ramping constant damage is no longer needed because games can be ended with enough burst damge from mages\") that will inform a lot of our future decisions. We've discussed a world where marksmen don't appear, I just think it becomes very \"explode everything in 5 seconds\" kind of thing.\n\n>At PBE, Staff of Flowing Water was part of the Preseason for a day or two.

I was just wondering aout the risks of AD + AS item (other than BotRK/Triforce), or having one of the multiplier items build of something else than Zeal. But yeah, I'm probably in the minority thinking of Firecannon and Shiv's identical recipes as a problem. I just think it's nice when an item is defined by its recipe as well as by its passive.\n\n> Because I think the sweeping mechanic is shared by both and so having the two share thematic coloring makes sense from that capacity. Farsight was colored blue for its initial overlap with CV (rest in pepperonis).\n\nTo be fair the change of color would have been much more needed if one of them revealed stealth and the other did not, but still - color coding helps a LOT while referring to specific items. \"Get the blue smite\" - \"Okay\". \"Get the red trinket\" - \"Which one?\". Both smitems and trinkets have long, two-part names, and it's not easy to type it out every time (and is it \"oracle trinket\" or \"oracle alteration\"?).\n\n> I think we went for the core thematic - a shield - but perhaps didn't feel beholden to green. \n\nHere, let me help:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/pgoM3XW.png\n\nProblem solved.\n\n> If player adjustment is a hard - \"we must buy pink wards\" - to the point where it becomes mandatory to play against stealth champions, we'll fix accordingly.\n\nI think the new sweepers are pretty rad, but the problem in lategame teamfights will remain. Supports already leave their last slot for pink wards, but this would possibly deprive tanks/junglers of their last item slot as well, forcing to carry pinks around.\n\nThrow some pre-made solutions on the board to be ready when needed. Mandrake Ward as an active drop or as the green trinket would work as well. I think Kha'Zix, Akali and Vayne will be manageable, it's just Rengar who'll cause trouble.\n\n> Holy moly you started with an interesting discussion topic but quickly devolved into enforcing an opinion. I'd be curious to understand what changes we deliberately made to Zyra to make her 'dead' mid lane, or if the meta just passed her by.\n\nI think the whole \"question\" was loaded, it was an observation for 90% of the time. As for Zyra, you didn't \"make\" her dead in the mid lane, just the nerfs to her base damages (burst) and free CDR made her no longer powerful enough to go 1v1 there, retaining only her CC/DPS potential, much more appreciated in the bot lane. I'm just afraid that when you nerf Brand, the exact same thing will happen - he'll be dead mid lane, and only viable bot lane. And considering he's reliant on items after all (at least Rylai's and Liandry's), the experience of having him underfed in bot lane is far more painful than losing the mid lane, as in the mid lane you'll always have gold for at least one item that you can hope to turn the game around with.\n\nSo I guess a better question would be: do you think that Brand is too strong right now, and where is he stronger than he should be? A completely acceptable nerf would be removing his ability to proc Tribute on Spellthief's Edge with DoTs (perhaps retaining it on Frostfang), or shifting his damage from base to scalings (or just nerfing some base damage from Q). Right now he's performing well in short games and not-so-well in longer ones.\n\n> We'd love to see how everything is shaking out rather than gut reacting to things that immediately appear too weak or too strong.\n\nTrue about Riven, but with Zed it's been a more long-standing issue and I've seen you adjust him on the PBE already. Anyway, thanks, that one is solved for now.\n\n> We've discussed a world where marksmen don't appear, I just think it becomes very \"explode everything in 5 seconds\" kind of thing.\n\nHey, Curse of the Sad Bullet Time was sort of entertaining.

If you feel like the skill disparity on the PBE is too high, why not have placement matches position you around your live MMR? One of the main issue is that in any given game, you will always have Silver-Plats on both teams. Why not make the matchmaking actually relevant (since matchmaking can't be relevant if the MMR isn't, and your MMR isn't relevant when you have 8 games played)?\n4. What is the true reason behind the hotfix? I'm guessing that it's not \"well, Graves is strong\", so it must be more complex than that. Is it simply that you guys feel like the power discrepancy between Kog and Graves is too big which will make a long lasting negative impact on Kog'Maw?

The old critless build gave her a steady stream of dps that made it easy to determine when to rend. However since crit has become the optimal dps build timing rend has become really awkward. Your attacks do more damage now so your target's health drops with less attacks, which means less spears before you rend, and random crits makes it difficult to anticipate how much damage your next attack will do. The end result is I find myself sometimes overkilling targets with auto attacks or only being able to rend for a small amount of damage.\n\nSince rend is the main focus of Kalista's gameplay I think she'd feel better to play if she interacted with crit differently, kind of like Ashe.

So far I personally enjoyed league as a more strategical-approach to the Moba-genre, but this preseason really got me confused about your intentions/long-term-visions.\n\n- Have you ever considered to not focus on SR for a Preseason, but just leave it as it is (with the ocassional juggernaut-patch to keep things fresh every now and then ofc) and instead use all those ressources to finally really bring Dominion and TTT to life? Those maps are really great to play from my perspective and have lots of unexplored potential.\n\nAs:\n\n- right now there are two main problem from my perspective with this preseason:\n\n - Diversity/Items:  on the one hand you made an effort to make each marksmen stand out gameplay-wise, but on the other hand you then funneled all of the marksmen to operate on crit. There´s no alternative anymore...before the revamp you could actually play some ADCs as AD-Casters, or bruisers, or hybrids, or as a \"classic\"-carry - depending on your item-choices. Now those options really don´t exist anymore. Crit is not only slightly better, it´s mostly the only real option. So you actually took a lot of diversity out of the game by making every item \"viable\" for everyone...\n\n - \"games are brutish and short\": well, i guess your data should support this...but average game-time really took a huge hit, leading to many games finished with 1-3items in the inventory, lategame became sort of a non-viable-utopian-dream. And there are 3 main factors causing this:\n \n   - less vision than before, amplifying snowballing due to making any environment not protected by towers unsave when behind\n   - less effective hp on turrets, leading to very early inhibitors/more dark areas on the map\n   - the \"ad-meta\", as ad snowballs just more than ap/tank for two reasons:\n        - most of the dmg is linked to auto-attacks, so you can´t dodge it and outplays become a non-factor, it´s all about stats\n        - they don´t only kill Champions faster when they get more items, but also take objectives faster.","replies":[{"poster":"PWYFF","date":"2015-11-14T02:06:18.857+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">What´s your personal take on the Moba-genre at Riot - should the games be more strategical, or more actionpacked? So far I personally enjoyed league as a more strategical-approach to the Moba-genre, but this preseason really got me confused about your intentions/long-term-visions.\n\nPersonally, I think a good balance between strategic and tactical. I want to know that there's a team out there who isn't super mechanically gifted but wins on superior drafting, map positioning, and rotations, but there's a team out there who's just shit at the previous three but can eke out wins on sheer executional talent. \n\n>Have you ever considered to not focus on SR for a Preseason, but just leave it as it is (with the ocassional juggernaut-patch to keep things fresh every now and then ofc) and instead use all those ressources to finally really bring Dominion and TTT to life? Those maps are really great to play from my perspective and have lots of unexplored potential.\n\nThis is me speaking personally, but while I do think Dominion and TT have great potential as game modes, I just fundamentally believe SR is the most 'true' version of League and we would be remiss to ever *not* prioritize its development. As with any development company, we have to understand what our vision is for the future and develop products that push that vision along - not ones that are interesting for the sake of being interesting. Dominion and TT are super fascinating from a design perspective and the space seems very cool, but I think the cost of actually developing its ecosystem and balance will - in all honesty - require a full-on teams much like SR takes to support. If I were to be even more candid, I think we didn't really understand the scope of work we were taking on when we pursued Dominion or TT and we've paid a cost in terms of trust as a result. But once again, these are just my thoughts on the matter.","replies":[{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2015-11-14T02:28:42.408+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"first of all, thanks for the reply (albeit, while i´m happy you share your view, i hope you consider carrying the questions to the official Q&A to get the official/broader statement on it aswell).\n\n>Personally, I think a good balance between strategic and tactical.

It feels like games end before they even get going. Trying to defend the turrets when they melt like butter to anything that hits them just seems impossible to defend. \n\nI feel like the weak turret issue is compounded by the low damage they deal and AP carries ability to nuke towers like ADCs. I just want to understand this direction better, because it is making late game scaling champions irrelevant. It is extremely difficult to stay in a game longer than 25mins and not be overwhelmed at your nexus. \n\nIn addition to this, the game feels very swingy at the moment. There are no close games. It's just an absolute stomp in either direction, as far as the games I have played. I've either gotten a small lead and removed my opponent's entire agency to respond to me, or gotten killed once or twice and been irrelevant the rest of the game. \n\nI do feel like Turrets need to go to the gym and get put on muscle juice.
