What&#039;s interesting to you? What would you like to hear about on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis?\r\n\r\nOver the next few weeks to Christmas, we&#039;re going to be introducing key designers and design leads on here - the intention being that they&#039;re all going to start up informal monthly dev blogs on key topics of interest (ie: Champion Balance with Jag). I&#039;d love for you to keep your eyes peeled to throw in any other suggestions for topics you&#039;d like to hear from them.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll stick around all day to talk.","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2015-11-24T21:47:34.383+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"One thing I would like are extensive discussions for champions that don't really fit into the game due to their kits being either too hard to balance/messy or unhealthy for them to be strong.\nDiscussing core aspects that make the characters who they are and get input from their player base would prevent outrages like Cassiopeia or Mordekaiser...\n\nSpeaking of which, I personally would love to have some discussion going for Mordie.","replies":[{"poster":"Anchan","date":"2015-11-25T00:25:36.244+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I concur, I really want to play Akali but I feel she doesnt have a real place in the game right now. Everytime she is kind of viable she has to get nerfed down cuz her kit is too strong and simple and \"anti-fun\"(?) to even allow her to be kind of viable. \n\nIts really sad liking this girl and its kind of frustrating when after years I cannot find any notion of Riot that would indicate \"yeah we realize there is a problem and we're trying to solve it\". \n\nLike, I know there are more important projects for champions that need more attention, but sometimes all I wanna see is that she's not totally forgotten. \n\nIf you need ideas (just for balance team): \n\nPut her Q to her passive, similar to what you did with Poppy. Like, her first AA is a ranged attack, the following 5 seconds she is close ranged with bonus lifesteal/magic damage if she hits the target she hit her last ranged AA with. And only this target, not the other guys. So if she range-AAs their tank or support, well, she probably wont be able to burst down their carries.\n\nThan you can give her some mobility or cc for her new Q and nerf her overall damage, so she only does real good damage vs the target she hit her last ranged AA with. Balancing will be much easier if she cannot easily 1v2 once she is fed, and even if behind she might be still able to burst a carry if she gets her AA off safely.  \n\n\nJust wanted to get this off my chest. You guys do great work, but its really hard to notice, even if one is always lurking on reddit for the latest infos. Maybe its because you have so many different players to care for, so that the individual player gets kind of left behind. Like, I dont rly care about fun-maps, but I know many ppl do, so I can see Riot putting effort in this area which is kinda wasted for me as an individual. Same with Summoner Icons and what-not, but I dig the champion reworks and sometimes skins. \n\nIts hard to please everyone, all of the time. Would be cool if its possible to maintain discussions or info-leaks about each champion at least once a year. Would be fine if its just \"we dont know yet\" or \"who is this champion\", but the uncertainty (?) is killing us lol.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2015-11-24T22:31:55.074+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"- The {{champion:82}} plans you promised to show last week.\n- Something about the Immobile Mages work in progres.\n- State of {{champion:44}} rework.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2015-11-24T22:12:22.138+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Healthy and unhealthy champion designs. \n\n I want to hear about reactions to champions being made that Riot is happy with or proud of compared to others which cause an \"oh dear god what have we done?\" reaction and why, in addition to comparing your reactions to community response to them.

What sort of more in depth statistics are used for balancing? I'm thinking along the lines of things like, how do you balance across skill levels for champs that are heavily gold/item dependent (do lower elos play poorly with some champs because they can't get the items until 40 minutes in kind of thing, or are they actually equal due to way more kills at lower elos)? What proxies do you use to determine if a champion is balanced? This might relate more to development: is there a standard champion for each role to balance around when developing new champions or reworks, kind of like the Renekton bar that was referenced a season or so ago for top lane?\n\nI'm interested in hearing about the statistical and analytical side to balance, and usually all we hear about is that a certain champ might be too strong/weak and so we're testing incremental stuff or whatnot.

We want to know what's going on, why things are the way they are, and just to feel like we're in the loop. Ultimately, a lot of companies are out of touch with the players on things, and I think they should close that gap. A good example of this are Hearthstone deck slots. People have asked for additional deck slots for more than a year now. Blizzard has come out with various discussions about it, about why we can and can't have it, but the net result is that almost everyone you talk to would like them, that they haven't come out yet, and that they're rarely willing to let us in the loop. The same is true for League, that we ask for various things and we'd like various things to happen, but Riot doesn't do them and doesn't talk to us about it.\n\nI'm a programmer myself, and I understand how things work. There are all sorts of reasons why things can't happen, or why things get delayed. Projects get scrapped, whatever, I understand how it goes. What I don't get is why players are always left in the dark. Yeah, it will obviously be a let down when you tell us something like the Magma Chamber or whatever is coming soon, then never comes. But personally, I'd rather know what things you're working on. When you don't tell us that you're working on anything, we kind of get the sense that you're simply not working on anything. That obviously isn't true, but when we look at the things that are getting done, it can certainly come across that way.\n\nA good Riot-based example is the replay system. What's going on with that? Last we heard, there were technical issues that they couldn't sort out that made it impossible to give us. I strongly disagreed with those technical issues and how they couldn't provide us with replays, or why things had to be the way they wanted it done (which was server-side as opposed to client-side). But the thing is, we never have a chance to say anything or hear anything. Riot keeps us in the dark, gives us one update, and then crawls back into the cave. We don't have to operate like that, we want to stay informed. We want to feel like we're a part of the decision making, or that our voices and opinions are being heard, because let's face it, we're the ones playing the game.\n\nAnyway, that's my opinion on it and what I'd like to see.

Could you please provide us Riot's plan on Urgot?","replies":[]},{"poster":"SunSlayerKD","date":"2015-11-25T01:19:32.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Excuses for perhaps looking at stuff the wrong way/ being too selfish in these. \n\n-First of all, I would like to hear if there are any plans at all to make variations on Summoner's Rift. I know, I know: \"oh god, another one\".\n\nI don't expect you guys are woking on full map variations, so I was thinking...\n \nYou guys already made (and are continuing with making) themed minions (Pool Party, PROJECT, Snow Down). These are really nice, but are you planning on going further with these? E.g: adding pieces every year or so? \nI'd love to see Sand Towers at summer or Snowman towers during Snow Down. if so, slowly but surely the maps would change into a more seasony look.\n(maybe also the VS in loading screen being more summery/icey/mechanical(for PROJECT))\n\nI'd also like to know why the decision was made to only keep the things like PROJECT minions||Butcher's Bridge|| icon-specific Poros/finishers temporarily.\n\nIs it too much stress on the servers? Is it because it wouldn't be as special anymore? Is it too much work to keep maintained for an extended time?\n\nA lot of work went into Butcher's and I have seen ideas like making it random on which you'll fight. I understand you'll want to keep things more special and seasonal (like the icon-specific poros & finishers), but seeing as there was SO much work put into this & the next Harrowings might not necessarily be about Bilgewater as much, I thought I'd ask.\n\nFor PROJECT minions/loading in-game, there isn't really a seasonal cue, right? Are you planning on returning them whenever there will be something Mecha/Battlecast/PROJECT released or around the same time that the five newest PROJECT skins were released (which might then also be the time more come out)?\n\n\n-Second, what is your guys' opinion on crit chance going from a nice extra to an absolute necessity to an abundance on ADC? Do you feel like there is a problem with the RNG in the laning phase (up until 2-3 items)? What do you guys think about the idea where crit on items (with some exceptions like Yasuo & Ashe) is disabled for a limited time/grows to the item's full potential over time/does less damage? \ne.g:\n2A) Let's assume the game is 10 mins ongoing and you buy a 15% crit chance item. In the latter case, you could get like 10% immediately (10 mins) and gain 1% per minute until 15 mins when all items gain their full crit potential. \n2B) The game has been going for 10 minutes and you buy a 30% crit chance item. This means 15% immediately, as it increases with 2% over time until full potential at 15 minutes.\n2C) Game has been going for 20 minutes and you buy a 30% crit chance item. This means you just instantly get your 30%.\n3) Instead of 200% from the beginning of the game, crit does about 150%. This makes the fights less dependant on RNG, since it does less damage. Over time, this increases until normal.\n\nI remember back when BloodThirster was usually the first item rushed, IE was a really strong item, but the crit wasn't as necessary to feel like you were doing damage than now.\nAfter IE-rush became the standard, ADC duels became less of knowing your damage and planning it out, but more of planning out a part and hoping you crit to win. You don't crit, but the enemy does, purely by chance => you lose the duel, even if you might have planned it out better.\nThen, the tank meta happened (Cinderhulk, a buff to armor, Juggernauts even) where it felt like you couldn't do any/enough damage unless you crit (or you were a champion that automatically shredded tanks like Vayne & Kog).\nNow, preseason. I haven't played too much so if I'm wrong, ignore the last part of the question ;)\nIt seems like crit has become even more of a necessity on ADC, as many more items grant it now as to open up more build paths.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2015-11-24T22:27:59.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Updated Skin Splash Arts, like what you did with Poppy and few patches ago.
