I think it'd be great to have part of the follow up process be to create a thread (like this one) for communication specifically about that project.\n> \n> Morde had something like this in the Dev Corner, and look at the difference in how Boards perceives the way his rework has been handled vs say, Cass: \"I don't like what Riot is trying to do with Morde but at least they're giving him attention / Riot just hates Cass.\" It's particularly important to note here that the general consensus about how the rework is handled is positive **despite** the general consensus on the rework itself being (slightly) negative.\n> \n> IMO, the Dev Corner should function more like the Red Tracker, but only track posts where the OP is a Rioter (and perhaps, also make it opt-in, so Rioters can post off of the Dev Corner, but still on the Red Tracker). Alternatively you could just offer a filter to the Red Tracker for this purpose. This would somewhat alleviate the perception that HIMM Sandwich refers to about *Gameplay* communication particularly, as a lot of the Dev Corner posts would otherwise belong under Gameplay.","replies":[]},{"poster":"spavined","date":"2016-01-07T00:50:28.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:33}} OK.","replies":[]}]}
