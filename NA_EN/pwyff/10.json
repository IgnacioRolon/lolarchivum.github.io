In previous lives I&rsquo;ve played video games competitively, ghost-wrote college essays for tuition, wrote terrible movie scripts for free dinners, and did the whole video game journalism / editor-in-chief bit before arriving at Riot Games.\n\nI come from a mixed competitive gaming background of: **FPSes** (CS 1.6, Natural Selection, TFC), **MOBAs** (DotA, HoN, Bloodline Champions), and **MMORPGs** (Ragnarok Online, FFXI, vanilla + TBC WoW), so my favorites tend to fall along those. In between games of League, DotA 2, and Duelyst, I was trying to speedrun Fallout 4 before dropping everything for the new Bloodborne DLC, but did not get very far. I think I rerolled twice, explored fifty million supermarkets, recruited Nick Valentine, decided to forcibly set my carry weight limit to 20,000 so I could hoard more things, realized I opened Pandora&rsquo;s Box of cheat codes and shortcuts, set my melee stats to five billion, punched a few Deathclaws, and then couldn&rsquo;t go back to a normal life.\n\nOutside of *those* things, I read, write, walk, and talk a lot (often at the same time).\n\nI currently own: 0 cats.\n\n**WHAT AM I DOING AT RIOT?**\n\nA tl;dr would be that I&rsquo;m a communications lead, working on all things to do with&hellip; communicating. One of my first big projects was to improve the way we talk about change in League (particularly in design), and you may have noticed the experiments we&rsquo;ve run over the years, especially with the patch notes.\n\nThese days, I&rsquo;m focused more broadly on how we talk about what we do and why we do it. With the preseason just shipping and the 2016 season update on the horizon, I&rsquo;m in the process of helping with our next Riot Pls update, getting this Dev Corner to a functional place, and thinking about what people actually want to hear about.\n\n**WHAT AM I GOING TO TALK ABOUT?**\n\nI&rsquo;ll probably use my monthly slot as an open forum to talk about what new things you&rsquo;d like to hear from other teams. If there&rsquo;s a pressing topic you&rsquo;d like to see discussed, feel free to chuck them in and I can understand what we should be thinking - or talking - about. Or if it&rsquo;s just a miscommunication, I can talk about that as well.\n\n**WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR FROM ME?**\n\nHonestly? Let me know. I can tell you stories about life at Riot, or how teams work together, or about the cat I don&rsquo;t own.","replies":[{"poster":"aperson1","date":"2015-12-14T22:07:31.268+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Complaint:\n\nI don't know how involved you are in its production, but the Patch Rundown is basically complete fluff. All I see is a bunch of Rioters patting themselves on the back over a change while the 4th guy awkwardly sits there and laughs.\n\nI was looking through old patch notes on a nostalgia trip and came across [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drNRCr8KTPA) old preseason 3 Patch Preview video. Instantly at the beginning of the video I know which changes are going to be discussed. Despite being less than half as long as the patch rundowns it easily covers just as much information, and I could skip to any part of the video and instantly understand what change they were talking about without having to sit through some stupid in-joke. \n\nI'm not saying Rioters shouldn't have any personality whatsoever, but your changes affect a lot of people's enjoyment of the game and if you're going to talk about them you better, well, talk about them. \n\nSorry if I'm yelling at the wrong guy about this.","replies":[{"poster":"PWYFF","date":"2015-12-14T22:21:13.442+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, you're talking to the right guy.

Having someone explaining why a change has occurred won't make me always like the change (Swain W change still uncalled for imo) but, it does allow us players who have biased views to see Riot's side of things. I don't have the skill or patience to sift through thousands of match data to accurately say why a change happens. \n\nAnd just reading a bland note that basically says:\n\n\"Swain too strong according to rito have fun landing it on Yas and ever getting to hurt him\"\n\nis not as nice as having actual people talk about the change. I would have to state that my only beef with the current patch rundowns is that some changes are just glossed over while others get 3min plus of discussion. I know the talks are meant to be on casual level but the discrepancy in discussion time of certain subjects seems like bias towards pushing certain changes and ignoring others that may have people upset.","replies":[]},{"poster":"aperson1","date":"2015-12-15T00:05:05.228+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is IMO, I don't mean to speak for anyone else:\n\nI think \\#2 is the best use of the Patch Rundown, so if there's a change a lot of people are really going to be up in arms about the community can simply point to that video. If your explanation isn't consistent or sensible enough it's very easy for the community to tell you this. I feel the more minor changes are pretty easy to understand through the little blurbs you put in the patch notes.\n\n\\#1 isn't really going to be possible to accomplish with a conference-style discussion among Rioters. Only you guys will be able to appreciate your interactions with each other. I also speculate that there are a lot of people enjoy the game and follow conversation about it really deeply but don't really like Riot's company culture. If you really want to convey personality, I think you should use [Ben Brode's talking head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIpWnb4NyrM) as an example. It feels a lot more personal to me as a player, even though (or is it because?) he's talking relatively seriously in a semi-official capacity.\n\n\\#3 isn't really going to happen in a one-shot video format. Especially when you bring in pros and pro analysts, sometimes it almost feels like they are afraid to criticize the patch in front of the people who made it. Plus, it's hard for the average Joe to relate to guys who are constantly thinking about what's strongest at the highest level.\n\nI think a cool alternative option, if you guys have the time and energy to do it, would be a few hour developer livestream (could be solo, but I think a panel would make more sense) at some set time after the patch. Read chat, answer questions. You have a large playerbase, so getting a lot of diverse responses will be really easy. Yes, it will probably be awkward at first, and there will be a lot of general stupidity and a lot of toxic bashing from angry anonymous players, but if you truly want to get into a real back-and-forth discussion that is easily the best way. Plus it's also a great way to, as you put it, \"humanize\" the team - regular live interaction is a great way to \"sharpen\" a personality to your viewers. And if it doesn't seem to work out you can simply scrap it.\n\nThere aren't a whole lot of studios who have the opportunity to do this kind of interaction, so I hope you at least give it a thought.","replies":[]},{"poster":"randomy","date":"2015-12-17T00:55:57.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Patch Rundown should never repeat anything said in the Patch Notes.  ATM there’s a lot of “why this change” and the designer on deck literally repeats the line in the notes.  There’s no expansion going on there.  If there are devs and pro players in a room together, I don’t want them delivering information I could deliver myself.  I think it’s fair to expect players to read the patch notes – or watch one of the community’s TLDR videos – before coming to a high-level discussion.\n\nI think there’s definitely a place for “Patch Summaries”, but that’s the sort of thing that should be embedded in the top of the Notes, narrated by just Scarizard or whoever.  The format being presented currently is more of a “Patch Discussion”, so maybe the misnomer is causing frustration when people load the videos for the first time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Orisi","date":"2015-12-15T03:30:25.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that two videos would probably be better than one for this sort of content discussion.\n\nBefore the most recent iteration you had a single rioter stood chatting in front of a board that displayed most of the big impactful changes, could show some of them in action, and maybe take the time to throw out the thinking behind the choices made in the same general way that the notes themselves do; it acted as a visual rundown of the written notes and I felt worked quite well.\n\nF you brought back this style of patch rundown, you could keep the current iteration as a patch 'round table' released halfway through each patch discussing what reaction has been to the patch, and how Riot intends to act on that reaction even if it's just to wait and see. Take questions from the Patch Note comments that are fairly common or well-supported and address them, even with a guest present as it is now to help chivvy conversation along. This would help to prevent discussion of patch notes that are fairly self-explanatory, don't cause any real community dissection and allow a more focused and in-depth discussion on the contentious issues.\n\nIt also has the added effect of giving a regular weekly video update; patch notes, patch discussion, patch notes,patch discussion. A solid pattern of information with dialogue interspersed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ashe Jungle","date":"2015-12-15T01:10:10.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just putting thoughts down on a page here, so forgive if they feel a bit jumbled.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Riot Pwyff,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=orGt4Gw6,comment-id=000f0000,timestamp=2015-12-14T22:21:13.442+0000)\n>\n> Nah, you're talking to the right guy. So I've got Scarizard directly trying to tackle this issue next year to get the Patch Rundown to a more authentic place.\n> \n> The question I'd ask is this: what should the patch rundown be for?\n\nI personally don't like seeing patch contents in the patch rundowns. I've usually read the patch notes by the time I watch the rundowns, and that makes it feel like a waste of time. If I wanted to read the patch notes, I'd read the patch notes.\n\nThere's an interesting thing where right now \"Patch Rundown\" as a title feels more like it should be a summary of the patch notes. \"I don't have time to read the entire notes, let me just quickly watch / listen to the rundown so I'm not completely out of it.\" \n\nHowever, it turns out I only feel this way because such a thing doesn't exist. I think if you were to add a Patch Preview, I would expect a Patch Rundown to be a discussion of the rationale behind each of the changes -- more in depth. Though, this also runs the risk of too much overlap with patch notes.\n\nI think right now there's significant missed opportunity to show videos of new content in action. Something like the recent Soraka Q range nerf comes to mind. Being able to see a side-by-side of how far and fast my Q goes compared to before would be SO much more helpful than trying to understand how the changes will *practically* affect my gameplay (and clear up confusion about whether the travel time is getting nerfed, etc).\n \n> Right now I think the larger issue is we have *one* piece of video content trying to serve multiple purposes, and ultimately failing at all.\n\nAgreed very much.\n\n>If I could flip back the curtain, our goals are:\n> \n> * Humanize the League design team\n\nI think right now this is failing because it's *trying too hard.* Unless you want to hire a movie director to write an awesome script and have everyone rehearse it for a longer time frame than you have to work with, you're not going to be able to script _human._ Instead, just let it happen naturally. I doubt it's an explicit goal of the LCS to Humanize the casters (I could be wrong), but they are oh so very human, because as they talk about content, they let their personalities come through. It's much harder to do this with curated content, but I think it's still possible.\n\n> * Discuss contentious changes, **show our thought process**\n\nThis is what I'm most interested in. Some of my favorite moments on the Rundowns have been when people from the playtest team were there, talking about ridiculous things that happened in their games. I'd love to hear more about previous iterations and where they did or did not work.\n\n> * Engage in a meaningful discussion on changes\n\nI'm not really even sure what this means, could you clarify? (Feel free not to respond to the rest of my post -- as long as you've read it I'm happy).\n\nIf it's supposed to mean, \"Have the people on the show debate whether the changes will accomplish their goal or not,\" I would prefer that Rundowns not go in this direction. Every player is going to have their own opinion. There's already *tons* of discussion about how changes will affect the game on Boards and Reddit. Only time will tell if the changes actually will have the desired affect. I think it's plenty just to state the rationale behind the change (mostly already done in the patch notes). I think is is also where people like APerson1 think you're just patting yourselves on the back.\n\nIn summary, I'd rather get information than speculation.\n\n> For others, however, the patch rundown is seen as a vehicle to communicate what's changing. Should that be our goal? Are players happier if we just tell them \"this is changing and here's why\" a la patch note format, or do they want to see discussion on the topic with people they trust?\n\nI think when you phrase it that way there's a strong bias towards people answering \"discussion with people they trust.\" But quite frankly, I'm confused as to what a discussion of the patch notes is supposed to look like. If there's information that's important and relevant to the patch, it should be in the notes, so discussing it here just feels like re-hash. If it's either unimportant or irrelevant, I'm not (yet) sure why I should care.\n\n> This is basically the space we're grappling with. In an ideal world, I'd love to have two streams of content - one high level TL;DR of the patch notes for quick, easy consumption, and another focused on deeper context.\n\nI agree. Suggest 'Patch Summary' or 'Patch Preview' for the high-level and 'Rundown' for the deeper dive.\n\n> So what are your thoughts?\n\nI'd love to hear more about the design process, different things you tried, and why they did or didn't work out. Basically, *how* you came to a decision rather than *why.*","replies":[]},{"poster":"ItemsGuy","date":"2015-12-14T23:58:21.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Pwyff,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=orGt4Gw6,comment-id=000f0000,timestamp=2015-12-14T22:21:13.442+0000)\n>\n> Nah, you're talking to the right guy.

In an ideal world, I'd love to have two streams of content - one high level TL;DR of the patch notes for quick, easy consumption, and another focused on deeper context.\n> \n> So what are your thoughts?\n\nI think all three of those goals are worth pursuing (it's a lot easier to palate even the most sour of balance changes when you can see that it's coming from real people who are trying to make the game more fun for everyone, even if they have to knock your main's movespeed down a bit), but I think so far the first one hasn't been reached for in quite the right way. \n\nA common gripe I have with a lot of Riot's communication with the community is that it relies way too heavily on in-jokes and memes, which are low-hanging fruit for all intents and purposes--they have a wide reach and are generally meant to lighten the mood (everybody knows about \"tons of damage\" even if they don't know what it means or where it came from--but the fact that, for example, it's the only description available for the Trinity Force item in-game rather than existing as flavor text illustrates this problem on a smaller scale), but are complete fluff as aperson1 put it. \n\nWhen looking at Patch Rundowns, I think it's good to keep in mind their context as existing alongside proper patch notes. They're best suited for that quick overview look to see what to expect this coming patch so folks can know what to expect before going into a game without having to read through every 3 base AD change that was made, so wider assessments (\"This week, we're taking a look at Juggernaut power and a few Marksmen who have been needing some love\"), with less emphasis on exact data and more on the nature of the changes and why they were made.\n\nOn patch notes, there's usually a short paragraph explaining what changes are and why they were made, but the Patch Rundown format is good for anecdotes (\"X champion has been struggling lately, especially with the popularity of this other champion in their role, so we'll explain some situations that illustrate the problem, talk about the solution we're trying, and detail a few scenarios where those changes would be most noticeable\") and getting into stream-of-thought detail and the process behind the changes themselves. As far as humanization goes, I'm not sure if this would apply to everyone, but I think hearing things from Rioters themselves and hearing their perspectives as people who are working on improving the game would be enough to make them seem more like humans to me and less like machines that exist solely to piss me off by making Tahm Kench not run away fast--or worse, like corrupt corporate memesters seeking to placate the masses by reminding them where Mundo goes and whether or not it's to his liking.\n\nI've had the pleasure of chatting with some of Riot's designers face-to-face, and they were some of the most honest and earnest people I've met. Putting a face to a name and a balance change does more than I think you guys might be giving it credit for, and I don't think it does those guys justice to hide their passion for what they do behind memes and jokes meant to soften the blow of whatever tough decisions they've had to make.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2015-12-14T23:43:30.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is having two videos possible?

I believe the current view of pet controls is \"tolerable,\" if not very exciting.\n\nYou mention that adding pets / pet controls would add a lot more depth to the game while also offering more avenues of kit ideation (and skill expression), I wonder about that.\n\nYou can add any sort of mechanic to a game to make it more 'complex,' but good game design is about the *right* combination of complex mechanics. If CS:GO suddenly added bunny-hopping into the game, it certainly becomes more complex from a movement-shooter based perspective, but it loses out on the type of game it wants to be.\n\nI'm assuming that adding a second unit to control beyond basic movement (aka the current system) will raise the mechanical complexity of the game, but if this assumption is true, should that be where League's design focus is on? Most designers would say there's a lot of really cool space to explore with single-champion kits. Perhaps there could be a champion designed with the 'illusion' of pet play - maybe a multi-unit champion with pre-defined positioning based abilities (hello, Orianna) - but the better question is what a complex pet system offers over other new systems.\n\nNow that I've laid out the conceptual space, I can offer my own opinion. \n\nI think there's room for some cool pet mechanics in a game like League, but probably not the likes of Chen or Meepo. There's this concept of transferable skills where if you learn, say, auto-spacing (heh) with Caitlyn, that's a transferable skill to Jinx. At the very least this allows you to build macro-mastery of League (positioning, map movement, etc) while also investing in the micro-optimizations of a champion.\n\nLooking at other games with pet champions, most characters with engaging multi-unit complexity reward the player for:\n\n* Cross-map macro play (Meepo teleports and movement)\n* Multi-unit micro-play (SC2 micro)\n* A really annoying radiance bear (Druid)\n\nI do wonder if the skill investment for any of these is so different for League that a champion who rewards players on these axis just makes them a novelty. The issue with novelty champions who reward players on very unique mastery paths is is you end up with massive disparities between the haves and the have nots, and balance becomes a nightmare. Riven is a great example of this. Do we now balance Riven with the expectation that all players have learned to animation cancel? Or do we just allow this one champion who, when fully mastered, has access to more tools and more power than anyone else? I'm not saying Riven is objectively overpowered, but the more unintentional power a champion can access through clever mechanical manipulation, the higher chance a designer just didn't account for it.\n\nThis paints a real black and white picture though. Could the pet system be improved even for the current pet-based champions? Absolutely. Is it an absolute priority for engineering to restructure how unit control occurs within League? I'm not sure.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DwarvenGiant","date":"2015-12-14T21:22:17.995+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there a team in charge of maps (delivering new ones)/maps updates at Riot or are projects like _Dominion, the Twisted Treeline Update, the Howling Abyss, the Summoner's Rift Update, the small map updates we got earlier this year and Butcher's Bridge_ simply require making somewhat-temporary teams, or what?\nAnd if there is a _'permanent'_ team working on such content, are they constantly working sneakily on super secret map projects? :o\n\n-_-\n\nP.S- Sorry if I gave too many examples in the first part of the question. lol :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2015-12-14T21:22:46.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is any game in particular from which you have learned a lot, developer communication wise? or that had a certain philosophy you learnt from? or that showed you how to handle 0 cats?

Using ask.fm only I think people would not see that a large number of other people vastly disagree with the Morde changes over all. It gives a shield and cloak when you are trying to be open.

As a Big Data-enthusiast, I would really love a Big Data post. I feel like there are more and more \"Big Data\" posts, like the Vayne Ping one recently, but it's a lot more about presenting casual side-projects (like a lot of teams do) than actually talking about Riot Games' data. I would really appreciate it if you could hook up someone works with the database, from my point of view, there are at the very least 3 different \"scopes\" at Riot Games that englobes completely different topics :\n\n 1. The internal exploitation : The people who work with the database to provide information as needed to the various teams. Might also have to provide various tools to gather the data, as needed.\n\n 2. The external exploitation : Those are the various dudes working on things like the API.\n\n 3. *The architect* : The various people working on the actual infrastructure which wons a shitload of cash because nobody wants their job.\n\nAn example of topic would be the \"Teamwork OP\" video series, where they could explain what kind of information they have access to, and how they define their methodology/terms/etc. How much information is manually worked through, and how much is computed. Another probably good one would be the new tribunal system, and the various implications that a \"fully\" automated system implies.\n\nThe other one would simply be a blog about the PBE. Personally, I feel like the PBE is in a really precarious state right now. I would really love to get a blog out of you guys about where the PBE came from, what its original objectives were, how they were met, where it excelled, where it failed, what plans you have going forward... A bti like the Mordekaiser/Tahm Kench threads, but with the PBE system instead.\n\n> Chris “Pwyff” Tom - Communications dude\n\nHow does it feel being constantly refered to as she/her, with a name like Chris Tom which really sounds like \"randomly generated male name #4\"? In the same vein, I feel like a lot of people started recognizing you as the memelord doing the patch notes. Is it hard to live up to that hype and making sure your memes are always on point?\n\n> One of my first big projects was to improve the way we talk about change in League (particularly in design), and you may have noticed the experiments we’ve run over the years, especially with the patch notes.\n\nIf you look at other companies, what do you feel is the most common problems they have in term of company-player relations? Personally, I feel like there's a massive misconception both within the players' eyes and the devs that communication is only required/positive when the changes are bad, but that's just one among many. \n\n---\n\nI've also had a lot of fun asking (roughly) the same generic questions to all the devs, so you're the next one on the list :\n\n- What is in your opinion the best/worst niche in LoL right now in term of design (split push, mobile mages, tank supports, poke supports, all in mid laners, AP junglers, etc.)?\n\n- Who are your favorite current rioters and ex-rioters?\n\n- What would you say is the biggest pros and cons of the current way PBE functions?\n\n- Favorite champion?\n\n- What design from another game would you like to see in LoL (even if unrealistic) and why?\n\n- If everything was to be turned into ice cream, what side dish would best accompany your SO (or best friend assuming there's no SO).","replies":[{"poster":"PWYFF","date":"2015-12-15T02:24:03.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> big data insights\n\nInteresting - I suspect the Clairvoyance dev blog could have some of those subjects sprinkled in. Duly noted.\n\n> PBE confusion\n\nI agree - there's a lot of confusion around how the PBE is used (often for load-testing, but not for precise balance testing, due to the player imbalances). I'll see what we can do there.\n\n> Chris Tom / Pwyff being ambiguous\n\nI get that occasionally, but I'm pretty careful about keeping my internet identity and offline identity separate, so as long as I'm perceived as doing a good job I don't care if Pwyff gets the reputation of being a fat smelly lizard.\n\n> Meme-y patch notes\n\nScarizard has been writing the patch notes for some time, and they've been getting a little too meme-y for my tastes, but I think it works for his voice.\n\n> Looking at other companies\n\nI think everyone's got a style, but there are a lot of lessons to be learned. I'd agree with you that I think consistent communication is important, rather than only talking when shit hits the fan. The biggest mistake I think most companies make is an inability to admit mistakes. I'm a firm believer in 'iterative communications' along with iterative design. Being clear about our intentions and goals, showing our intention, and then improving until we hit it. It's easy to go behind a curtain and get obsessed with being perfect out the gate. I think even we do that on occasion and that's something I'd love to work on.\n\n> What is in your opinion the best/worst niche in LoL right now in term of design (split push, mobile mages, tank supports, poke supports, all in mid laners, AP junglers, etc.)?\n\nHmmm, I don't think I've considered things in those kinds of terms. If you're talking about role mechanics or functionalities, I've always been a big fan of peel supports like Lulu, Janna, or Nami. There's a fun risk-reward to being the squishy one trying to enable teammates. But then their power isn't as appreciated and it can be tough to balance them in a way that allows them to feel satisfying and balanced. I've never really been a fan of split pushers because of the passive gameplay they create, but I can see the necessity of them to alleviate death ball pressure. It's an interesting balance.\n\n> Favorite Rioters\n\nidk man but Jag is a pansy\n\n> PBE functionality\n\nI think we'll talk about this deeper next year. Getting precise balance feedback from the PBE is rarely very helpful, due to the imbalance of player skill, the ping, and the sheer chaos of it.\n\n> Favorite champion\n\nLeBlanc, Nidalee, Fiddlesticks\n\n> Design from another game\n\nI think Puck is probably the most fun hero I've ever played, but there are obviously a lot of reasons why he wouldn't work in League.
