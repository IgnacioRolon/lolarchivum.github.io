And I'm curious about what it grants you, too - I believe it was mentioned as something to help push down your lane, but I'm just generally very interested to know what kind of advantages you pick up by grabbing that thing even if you're leaving your bottom half of the map out to dry.\n\nAnd further on the whole top lane/teleport thing, do you expect that we'll still see top laners starting at jungle camps and teleporting to lane, or double jungling, things of that nature, as a dominant strategy? Because frankly I've had about enough of that stuff. Of course, with Teleport being nerfed and Ignite/Exhaust being lauded as more viable for top laners to choose if they should want them, maybe that sort of thing falls out of favor entirely.
