If you want 2 junglers, you need extremely good communication, which you can't get in soloq. Secondly, it is not viable to play with 2 junglers unless you lane swap and that also requires extremely good communication. AD doesn't have to be ranged, but meta is like that. Reason for this comes way before League of Legends and games in general: simply guy with a bow, if he have good arrows and is precise ( aka range champion), will kill a guy with a sword without a shield (aka assasins). The time melee champion, without gap close, needs to be close to range is enough for range to seriously wound him or kill him.","replies":[{"poster":"Magnus Gavin","date":"2015-11-10T21:23:55.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm sorry, but those were just examples.

The trilane and offlane are cornerstones to DOTA's highly flexible meta, and without them you either have to run two duo lanes or put someone in the jungle, since the jungle can't really support two people farming it and you have nowhere else to put that person if you want a second solo laner getting full experience.\n\nDOTA's full of weird stuff like pulling, stacking, denying, etc., which probably seemed minor to remove early on in League's lifespan ( which were likely removed to reduce the amount of knowledge needed to play effectively ) but ended up causing quite huge ripples in the game's evolution path, since they have far larger effects than they might seem ( if you try to 1v3 lane in League, you'll end up so far ahead in exp compared to your opponents; where in DOTA, a good duo lane can actually zone you and control the wave well enough to make it so you only get like 31 experience from your lane by the time they're both level 6. )","replies":[{"poster":"PWYFF","date":"2015-11-10T23:37:01.553+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's a hell of a discussion to get into, and I don't want to go too deep on it, but I often wonder about this debate and the inherent assumption that less structure is always better.

Clarity. It has to grow to a video game not an exploitable spreadsheet. I've tried to summerize the direction of 5.22 and I do quite like some parts!

An idea allowing more than one 'kit design' (e.g. juggernaut or _new_) to at least perform **one of multiple secondary roles** by a greater selection of simplified 'equalizer' items sounds great .. and ambitious. The champion's kit will more or less still play the same but likely not as optimal in that secondary role compared to a champion who suits the role. Whichever way it goes, an optimal build for secondary roles will be discovered.\n\n* How can an assassin opt to be fighter? [select recommended items] - **Sufficient and optimized. You can do it!**\n* How can an assassin opt to be support? [select recommended items] - **Sufficient but not optimal.**\n* How can an assassin opt to be tank?

Do you end up saying \"Assassin Yi is garbage, only play Yi as a Fighter?\"\n\nI think DotA does an incredible job of encouraging experimentation and discovery. I think League has a far more structured \"position strength\" system where players can quickly compete and compare against others of their position - ie: battle of the mid laners like Faker vs. Bjergsen. You still get that with position 1-5 player comparisons in DotA, but often on a more holistic scale.\n\nUltimately, my argument comes to: why do we want to be DotA when DotA is an amazing DotA?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2015-11-10T21:16:57.233+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh...

I want old Garen back. I want old Udyr back. I want Mundo with some kind of real lockdown in exchange for his overbearing sit-on-you-with-damage dive pattern.\n\nI want a slippery tank who can wade into the enemy team with defensive steroids and low damage, and wade back out with tenacity and movespeed steroids. I don't want to be a juggernaut who races the carry's HP to zero. I want to provide pressure and zoning to enemy carries with my body and presence, and NOT my cc or damage. Garen and Udyr appeal so strongly because Garen could walk in and out with Q mobility and W tenacity and damage reduction, and Udyr could soak so much damage with spammable shields without committing.\n\nI still try to make this fantasy a thing in League, but over the last few months I've lost so many tools for it in item changes. Randuins, Thornmail, and Frozen Heart have each taken sizeable hits to their lategame effectiveness, and the replacements I'm being shown like Gage, Plate, and Titanic are so woefully lacking in defensive stats because they have this worthless damage, or cooldown based utility attached. I can't go anywhere anytime with those items, and my old standbys are rusting, especially considering all the new tools for ADCs to eat me with.\n\nI understand that the mobility and survivability I demand for my fantasy playstyle will come with tradeoffs. I'm prepared to do limited damage and forego powerful hardCC. I *loved* the old Garen, running around, regenning, and throwing an impactful silence now and then. I wish there were an option for me in this game.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-11-11T09:04:02.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think \"Also: you're not here to pose opinions as questions.\"\n\nimplies \"you're not here to pose opinions and not questions\" in general","replies":[{"poster":"EnderForHegemon","date":"2015-11-11T13:21:52.601+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds like your opinion... ;3","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SonicÐeHedgedawg","date":"2015-11-11T01:43:02.682+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure if I mentioned it in THIS thread yet or not, but, while I'm not really concerned it's going to ruin the game, I really wonder why pink trinket was removed from the game.

For the most part I thought probe were feeling Deathfire is the stronger mastery, so why does Thunderlord's have an internal cooldown but not Deathfire?\n\n\nOh...

Considering the jungler is one of the two members of the team most expected to control vision due to their roaming, and since every lane is now gonna have 2 ward charges by default on their trinket (which makes it trickier to find the unwarded route to gank from), I feel like the Tracker's Knife will become the mandatory jungle item so that you can pick up a red trinket to sweep wards.\n\nIs this at all a concern for the team as well? Or is the expectation that, with the overall number of wards reduced by not being able to buy them anymore, that the red trinket will be overall weaker by enough that the minor smite buffs from Skirmisher's Sabre/Stalker's Blade will actually be able to compete effectively?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Axes","date":"2015-11-11T01:20:04.476+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's something we'll certainly be watching, but {{item:3706}} and {{item:3715}} are both very powerful, and base yellow trinkets have 2 charges - there are other strong options.

But what do you have to say about this? Do you think that the snowball potential is indeed higher? If it gets out of control, how will you counter it - will you remove some of the implemented features?
