Just leave her alone if possible please.\n\nI've been a diehard Quinn main since she was released, and I loved her uniqueness. Her dueling potential against other AA based champions (due to her blind) was really unique and amazing, and the assassination pattern on an ADC it just amazing to have with the ult+all spells with an auto attack. \n\nWith these changes, you removed what Quinn is. You removed her core gameplay. I wouldn't even mind if you removed the blind but added dueling power against ADC elsewhere (like you can dodge a set number of AA or something like old Fiora W), because that is who Quinn was. She was one of the best duelers against AA based champs, and one hell of an assassin with her ult. Now, both things just got removed.\n\nLets see the change list, shall we?\n\nPassive: I actually like what you have done with it, it is the only thing you did right.\n\nW: Unchanged, which is fair. Two charges on the active would be nice, but this way is just fine.\n\nE: I just hope it got bugfixed, no need to change anything else tbh.\n\nQ: Ok just please no, by removing the blind you removed her uniqueness. And besides now it's just a regular plain skillshot that deals damage. Boring af. Also gets a harrier mark on the enemy, which isn't bad but still just meh. You removed the core thing that made her interesting. Now it is just basically a plain skillshot. Wow, interesting. Her damage may be up, but honestly you have no idea how much does the removal of her blind change her gameplay and most importantly matchups. Literally all matchups are COMPLETELY different because of it. Vayne used to be a problem? Just blind her, and you can kill her. Perhaps maybe Sivir? No problem, wait for her spell shield to end and blind her. Now, just no. This changed her core gameplay as Quinn. It was crucial to hit the blind in order to successfully kill the enemy ADC, and it offered great gameplay since you needed to be smart about using it. Now it is just deal damage or don't deal damage, while before it is mostly for utility. I wish the blind stays, or some kind of defense against AA for Quinn additionally (maybe immune to AA after her E or something?).\n\nR: Okay this is where I'm just done with it. You changed the thing that mostly made Quinn... well Quinn. Her attacks at Valor form were something really interesting and unique, that no other champion had. Her attacking and positioning in Valor form were unique to Quinn, and it truly felt amazing. Her assassination pattern was unique for Quinn (well, not really but unique for an ADC), and I loved every bit of it finishing the enemy off by vaulting in Valor form. It felt so great as a Quinn player, while it also required skill to survive after it if you are in a group of enemies (use R right after E right before you hit the enemy so the skystrike hits him but you as Quinn vault back). It was amazing, feels like you did something awesome and yet it still had counterplay and wasn't unhealthy for the game. Now, what is this? An ability? Honestly Rammus Q is more interesting than this. Basically a movement speed buff? For real? I bet the skystrike doesn't even deal damage. And earlier it didn't even deal much damage but it still felt good to use. Not more an assassination tool, which I miss the most on Quinn since that was the most fun part of Quinn as a whole.\n\nOf course Quinn had her problems and weaknesses. AA range was one, but with the Vault and Blind it was manageable. Yes, the passive is unreliable, but also unpredictable (unless of course using E) and it was really just fun. Her E basically let enemies free damage her, in trade for massive dueling power/utility against a single target. Her assassination pattern was really amazing to have as an ADC. I really love playing ADC, since it's my main lane and basically fits who I am. But I also enjoy assassins, even though I'm not that great at finding opportunities to strike multiple enemies. Quinn made both things possible in the same time. I would play the classic ADC marksman with dueling power I love to play, while I could just switch to assassin mode to finish the enemy. It made Quinn fun, and mostly Unique. Now Q is just a bland damage skillshot, and the ult is basically a movement speed buff (wow). I honestly hope you can give something of her old self back. \n\nHere are some of the changes I would recommend in order to keep the old Quinn feel back:\n\n- You could possibly make her dodge a few AA after using Q or E, but hitting an enemy (or more if it is Q). It would make Quinn feel more like a duelist. Or just simply make Quinn immune to AA of enemies hit with Q herself so she can still duel. \n\n- Possibly make E usable from R form, but getting in melee range and get her immune to the target's AA? Maybe for a set time, or for a certain number of AA, but anyway it would bring back the old Quinn feel, both as an assassin (since you would hit your Q 100% for execute), and as the amazing duelist.\n\n- Make Valor instantly target enemies after using her \n\nOf course this is all just speculation with the given info leaked. Since I really love Quinn and who she is, I wouldn't like her identity as a champion to get removed. I hope some of the duelist/assassination playstyle still stays. Thank you for reading (if you did xd) and I really hope I can get an answer.\n\nAlso would like to hear from you, was it your intention to remove the duelist/assassin playstyle and why if it was. Honestly it can be hard to balance, but since Quinn was rather on the weak side due to her natural low range and squishyness,","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spοοk","date":"2015-10-28T18:58:09.513+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"really looking forward for corki now","replies":[{"poster":"Jack º","date":"2015-10-28T19:04:28.799+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"every 5 mins... this boost better be op, because corki is like one of my fav <3","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scruffy","date":"2015-10-28T19:21:13.754+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"When he picks up \"The package\" he gets a homeguard like buff to help him find a fight/gank. \n\nThe \"special delivery\" (the mega W cast) is basically this:\n\n* 3x range of normal Valkyrie\n* Has a knockaside when it hits enemies\n* Damage zone is way more dangerous + it has a slow\n* Normal W is put on 0 cooldown after he casts it (to let him reposition)\n\nSo this ability is best used to separate a team fight or trap enemies in bad positions.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sedim","date":"2015-10-28T18:58:42.391+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotScruffy,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=whbJ5lH1,comment-id=00110000,timestamp=2015-10-28T18:39:33.894+0000)\n> Graves\n> \n> * We finally made his shotgun a shotgun -> up close burst damage marksmen\n> * Basic attacks fire multiple buckshots in a cone -> more damage up clost\n> * Q reworked to synergize better with the new basic attacks\n\nI love the fact that you guys are playing around with changes to the standard auto-attacks.
