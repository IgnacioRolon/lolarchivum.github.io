It will make minion wave control more confusing.  If you have an advantage I believe the power should be in the heroes, not some obscure minion buff.\n\nI also do not like the hidden mechanics in masteries like Deathfire Touch.  I did some testing to see how it works.  Seems it applies 3sec off Teemo Q, doesn't work at all with Teemo E or R.  Applies 5.5sec with Brand passive.  Why does the Brand passive DOT proc it differently than Teemo Shroom.  It seems very inconsistent and there is nothing in the description to explain this behavior (I'm not sure if this is bugged or intentional).  \n\nI like mastery tradeoff choices like the Opressor vs. Bounty hunter and Vampirism vs. Natural Talent, but I feel like many mastery choices seem like non-choices.  7% armor pen or 7% magic pen... I mean that's not a choice.  If you are AP you take magic pen, AD then you take armor pen... very boring.  Instead I'd propose something like 3% damage OR 8% bonus pen might be more interesting (i.e. are you trying to blow up squshies & wave clear, or alternatively hurt tanks).  \n\nAlong the same lines I feel there needs to be an alternative Ferocity AP capstone for the Deathfire Touch DOT.  A comparable flat damage buff (or similar) might be an interesting alternative depending if you are trying to burst targets down & wave clear (in which case you'd take a flat damage buff), or if you are going to poke and wear people down (in which case you'd take Deathfire Touch).  But if you are AP there is no Ferocity capstone alternative to Deathfire Touch... no choice whatsoever.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Stashu","date":"2015-11-11T23:04:05.283+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"At a high level, Ferocity is meant to offer consistent, target-agnostic damage. Contrast this with Cunning, which is meant to offer burst damage against squishy targets. These rather tight constraints on Ferocity limited our options (specifically, burst damage and waveclear were not on the table). \n\nThe resulting tree had some pretty bland areas, as you point out. We're with you in that we're not thrilled about the 'choice' on tier 5, but we really struggled to find alternative to % penetration that offered the kinds of choices we were interested in. We thought a lot about PVE damage, or alternate target agnostic mechanics (% hp damage, etc.), but ultimately couldn't nail something down that we thought was both healthy and appealing. As we continue to update / maintain the mastery trees, however,  this tier is definitely on our radar.\n\nAs for mages, this is true. There are no compelling keystone options for offense oriented mages in Ferocity aside from DFT. However, there _are_ compelling keystone options for offense oriented mages _outside_ of Ferocity. If you prefer burst to sustain damage, consider Thunderlord's Decree. If you prefer a more skirmish-oriented style of play, check out Stormraider's Surge :D. \n\nThat said, some feel that Thunderlord's Decree is strictly inferior to Deathfire touch, even for burst mages. We currently do not believe this is the case, but are definitely aware of the possibility. If this turns out to be true, we'll look to add a bit more ratio to TLD to compete.","replies":[{"poster":"Lucifer","date":"2015-11-12T00:17:48.468+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I  really don't think the ratio is the problem on Thunderlord's Decree- It's just the really long CD. 30 seconds is so long. It's what makes DFT better in almost all instances, simply because you're procing the 20%-10% over and over, vs the 10% + Flat damage on an irregular basis. At max level + full AP, TLD is doing over 300 damage in an AOE, so I really do not think damage is the issue. It would also be useful to add some clairty to TLD. As it stands, it's really hard to see how many procs you have on enemy champions. There's been a few times that I've been pretty sure I've been way over 3 procs, and it still won't go off unless I land all my spells in a full rotation. \n\nGoing along with this, I tested DFT, and I'm pretty sure it isn't consistently applying the DOT proc correctly on many champions, and often seems way lower than it's supposed to be.\n\nI'm also pretty worried that AP champions are superrrrrrrrrrr underwhelming compared to their AD counterparts at the moment, and it might be one of the reasons games are snowballing out of control in 20-30 minutes. \n\n_(maybe some opinions in here, but you have to expect opinions at this point <3) _","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nausicäa ","date":"2015-11-12T00:13:17.503+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This entire patch just flat out favors AD champions.\n\n-AP items massively increased it in cost, while AD remain mostly the same\n-AD champions get overall buffed with masteries while AP champions take a massive hit.\n\nI fail to see how Riot continues to deny that they are completely screwing over AP in the pre season.

But then you made him into an ADC/wanted him to play in an ADC role. His supposed primary item in bot is: {{item:3044}} , but the only things it builds into are: {{item:3078}} ,{{item:3071}} , and {{item:3184}} . I mean, Entropy might not be bad, but the others aren't great now, all things considerd, and it's not available in the rift. \n\nWhat I'm getting at is: What are Riot's plans with Mordekaiser given the new itemization changes and the ADC changes. I feel the changes with Tri-force seem odd, as a majority of champs who bought didn't actually have a wasted AP stat/had some form of ap scaling that gave them a benefit. ({{champion:24}} ,{{champion:120}} ,{{champion:39}} ,{{champion:41}} ,{{champion:78}} , {{champion:75}} ,{{champion:254}} , and to a lesser extent (only because the itemization for these champs are much more varied, and thus have better access to items) {{champion:236}} ,{{champion:42}} , {{champion:81}} , {{champion:96}} .\n\nI would argue that the CDR is interesting, but not really necessary for most champs who bought Tri, as most were top lane tanks who bought cdr oriented tank items like {{item:3065}} and {{item:3110}} /{{item:3025}} . Not to say they may not, but the CDR usually got covered in one way or another without triforce. \n\n \nIf the idea is to return Mordekaiser to his AP roots, wouldn't that mean you'd essentially need to buff his e output to put him back into dueling par? \n\nI'm not sure where Riot is going with Morde right now, does anyone have anything to say/ideas?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2015-11-12T02:47:35.404+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does a Soraka/Anivia/Karthus spell \"Crit\" proc BloodThirsty Warlord?

I know the masteries and such are supposed to help, but when everyone is spread thin trying to stop minions, it makes it harder for teams to focus on team battles. I hope that the minion update doesn't go through simply because it will make losing less enjoyable. I mean, how will anyone be able to turn the tides last minute and have a come back? I understand that it is supposed to be something to make the game more interesting, but all I can see to it are downsides for losing teams. The winning team will absolutely love it, but who wants to play a game they can never win? It especially makes it harder for those champions and players who are much better late game.\n\nSecondly, the mastery pages. . . When I read them, I said, \"Looks like League pulled a World of Warcraft.\" Simply put, looking over the mastery pages and reading what they do makes it too easy to decide what to pick. You've overly simplified them. The old ones were actually fun to look through, trying to pick things that would go well for a whole range of champions instead of specializing in two or three. I understand that maybe it was meant to help people pick what they wanted, but what fun is that? There is no need to test anything or try something new. It's too easy. Maybe the old mastery pages could have been updated a little with wording, but not have half of the points removed and have people only able to go in one side of the branch or the other.\n\nAnd lastly, because I know it is on a lot of people's minds from what I have been reading over the hours, I feel that League has now downplayed APCs and tanks by boosting ADCs. Not only has a lot of ability power and mana been taken from items, but we have even lost two summoner spells that gave back mana when we needed it. I used {{summoner:13}} in almost every one of my games. As a mostly APC player, I needed it for when I played Ziggs or Syndra and especially as Sona. All of my friends also used it. And it was taken from the game because there was a belief that no one used it. Already that puts a dent in what an APC can do, as they will be constantly recalling to restore mana, which will allow the enemy to take a turret. Now that the mastery pages have been completely changed, there is hardly any room for anyone to play a tank or APC. \n\nI feel that League, though the intentions were good, has tipped a precious balance in champions. I have seen more comments about people either quitting or others abandoning APCs and tanks just because the game now favors ADCs. ADCs are easier to build than APCs and now that the time to play games has been cut in half, mages and tanks will have no room to shine as ADCs take the spotlight. I hope that the minion update doesn't go through, just as I hope that some of these issues will be fixed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maikal","date":"2015-11-11T19:45:14.403+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

You'd probably still not get sated faster than in patch 5.21 even if you were able to take 2 - 3 epic monsters just because of the price increase.","replies":[{"poster":"PWYFF","date":"2015-11-11T21:21:19.952+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"1. This is a bit of an arbitrary question, akin to asking \"why not make the damage splash like Dragon?\" To me, Baron is a stationary objective because the expectation is teamfights will occur as pitched 5v5 battles so the chaos of an additional body chasing down targets isn't really necessary. There's tension and a requirement for a team to 'pile in' the pit to take down Baron, leading to better staged fights around such a high priority target.\n\nDragon and Harold, by comparison, are more skirmish-focused objectives and so the added flexibility of moving the mob, while contributing more chaos to the fight, feels like it should be there. Is it really so hard to coordinate backstabs?\n\n2. It was just an incredibly powerful item that was overbudgeted on stats in comparison to its other bretheren. If it's brought more in line with other items, we can definitely examine champions who utilize it as a core purchase, but we're watching for that.\n\n3. I don't understand the intent of this question. One is dependent on terrain / walls to deal full damage and is balanced accordingly, the other deals massive, long-range AoE damage.\n\n4.

We don't impact ranked or pro play, so we can really shake up the game and push it towards significantly new space.\n\nWe totally go into this work knowing some people will be pretty resistant to change. It's ok. Players love this game a lot, and some of them don't want it to change, even if we believe it will be much for the better.","replies":[{"poster":"Asylum Archfiend","date":"2015-11-12T18:36:23.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a small question about that. I get that from mid November to mid January usually is your sweet spot for testing out new things, but with this many changes, how do you tell which changes had which effects? For instance, did the new AD itemization push AD champions heavy into favor which made them outshine AP or was it the AP cost increases?\n\nFor smaller things like individual champion balance (Yasuo and Graves, for instance) it can be easy to target the problems, but in the grander scheme, won't it be difficult to discover what has which effect?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ThiloughNA","date":"2015-11-12T19:59:59.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Last season I mained Teemo jungle, and it was really really fun.
