In our future forecasts we'll probably throw these under the banner of \"Live Gameplay\" or \"Riot Live Gameplay\" to reinforce that it's an entire *team* that works on shipping each patch, and not a single individual (except nerfs. That's Morello. Only Morello.).\r\n\r\nRegardless, while we set all of that up, we still need to make forecasts. **SmashGizmo** of the Live Gameplay & Balance team will hang around after the post to answer any questions you might have. Remember, feedback should be more focused on how you feel about a change rather than getting real prescriptive about the exact change you want to see.\r\n\r\nOnward!\r\n\r\n**BRINGIN' UP THE SUPPORT / TANKY JUNGLERS - **Our largest narrative for Patch 4.11 is centered on bringing up supportive / tanky junglers. In competitive play, we're seeing a common trend of early aggression junglers in the form of Lee Sin, Elise, Kha'Zix, and Evelynn. When we see early aggression as king, those junglers also have the averse affect of invading and beating the snot out of the slower clearing utility-focused tanky dudes (like Maokai). On that note, our approach here is less focused on reducing the power of the stronger champions, and more on bringing up the power of the less capable.\r\n\r\nMuch of this shift will come in the form of itemization changes. Right now a lot of the items junglers are buying are more focused on amplifying damage (which tanky support junglers don't have a lot of) or giving raw tank stats (which tanky junglers want, but then slow down even more in the jungle). We think tank junglers are in need of a jungle item that better supports their play style across the board.\r\n\r\nTo go along with our item-focused changes, we've also singled out a few junglers who we're pretty sure will fall under the bar even with item changes. We feel like there are a few tank junglers who just have no reason to be picked over fighters, so we're going to amp up some of their utility in order to solidify their identity as scrappy disruptive picks.\r\n\r\nFinally, outside of the above narrative we're looking at a few high-priority champions who've been rather dominant in the competitive scene (and in ban rates at all levels of ranked play). Those champs include:\r\n\r\n**Kayle** - this is one tough angel to crack. Like we've said before, Kayle's big problem is that she lacks a lot of meaningful weaknesses to capitalize on. Specifically, does anyone know why Kayle's this hybrid damage-support champion who also happens to be top tier at both?\r\n\r\n**Jax** - Even though Jax is intended to be a champ that scales well into the late game, he's currently so well-rounded that 'scaling well' ultimately turns him into an offensive brick wall with very few weaknesses.\r\n\r\n**Ziggs** - Right now we see Ziggs as having a unique strategic fit in the game (stalling out to let his teammates ramp up in strength), but he's a little too safe in lane and still has a lot of offensive power to push a victory when a ahead. Adding on these strengths, Ziggs is also a well-rounded, consistent champion who can do a lot of things at once, so we're looking for ways to add more risk or unreliability to his kit.\r\n\r\n**Yasuo** - Yasuo's a really strong late-game champion but his weaknesses in the early game are masked by his high offensive threat. Good Yasuos need to balance offense *with* defense, but Yasuo's just bullying out opponents before they have the chance to really retaliate or capitalize on his moments of weakness.\r\n\r\nAnd that's all for this forecast! Expect to see a bevy of changes hitting the PBE sometime soon. Once again, **SmashGizmo** of the Live Gameplay & Balance Team will hang out after to answer some questions in between his work.","replies":[{"poster":"Hadriel","date":"2014-06-20T02:05:03.835+0000","up_votes":67,"down_votes":12,"body":"I posted this before when Riot announced a nerf for Kayle on patch 4.9, but it is mostly still applicable:\n\n\"Kayle right now is being played as an AP-scaling supportive mobile ADC because of her consistent burst, her high ramping damage and her high utility.\"\n\nWhile I understand putting Kayle into words might be difficult, this description is a sensationalist exaggeration of Kayle's strengths. She is an AP scaling supportive autoattack based carry with burst mobility, with high ramping DPS and strong windows of utility. She is not a \"mobile ADC\" because, for one, she isn't an ADC, and her mobility isn't an instantaneous movement spell nor does she have high base movement speed. She is on the harder scale of midlaners to position with because she deals her damage at 525 range with only a high cd speed burst to aid her that also forces her into the choice of using for heal or repositioning purpose. This renders her rather immobile in the midlane ecosystem. Also, there is no such thing as \"consistent burst.\" A champ either has burst or DPS. Lich Bane is the culprit of something like \"consistent burst;\" address that if you have issues with it, but Kayle's kit offers nothing of the sort.\n\nOn the topic of her nerfs, I can't understand why you've decided to do so or take this approach. 525 is already low range for an autoattacker, what you propose is absurdly severe and doesn't address any problem she might pose. The percieved problem with Kayle isn't she can't be reached, that's preposterous. Under this scope, Caitlyn might as well be immortal.\n\nThe new build is problematic, but there are are far more elegant solutions for this issue than removing her from viability by giving her literally Urgot range. If she needs more risk, then do the thing every Kayle detractor has always rallied for: give her ultimate a higher cooldown. She has her ult ready for every teamfight and sometimes can afford to use it TWICE. If you nerf her ult CD you create windows in which to force fights because she has to fight at short range and always relies on having her ult to insure she will get autos off even if she dies. THIS addresses the problem you cite, \"having no weaknesses\" which is also an exaggeration. She is weak to CC, AS reduction, reengagements, target changes and assassination provided her ult is unavailable. Most of these solutions require team coordination, which is why she's a good solo queue champion.\n\nOn competitive, the newfound build seems to be overwhelming, but you need not to gut her to fix the issue: you can code e so it isn't considered ranged and inhibit Runaan's use, or make it so the secondary bolts don't apply her passive (only on primary target). If you don't want to address the item (you should, then see how she dissapears once more like the FotM she is), you can make e's splash damage unable to apply her passive. If this proves to be insufficient, you can try to nerf e's slash radius, making her even more position intensive, and her enemies better equipped for fighting against her (space out).\n\nMy point is please, don't exaggerate what Kayle can do, don't downplay what she can't, address the real issues and don't target her before she can find opposition naturally (Akali murders Kayle, a fact not widely known). Don't pretend a range nerf isn't the most severe an AA based champion can receive. Be GRADUAL in any changes you apply on her and gather data before going further if needed. This is a champion who received a 0.4 AP nerf on top of a 0.25 AP nerf on Lich Bane which was a linchpin item on her.\n\nHer ult is the issue, try a flat 120 second CD (huge nerf most severe early and midgame) and you'll see immediate changes.","replies":[{"poster":"KLee1007","date":"2014-06-20T02:13:28.566+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":19,"body":"Not that i read your opinion thoroughly but i like that you find a problem from her Ult. When i see ppl  facing against Kayle, her Ult was always the problem before killing her. I think remaking her ult from 'invincible' to a 'thick shield with lesser affected from CCs' will give others to play her out a bit.

A slow, a snare, a stun.

We tend to only see tanks become viable when exterior factors like itemization and masteries are very strong (Looking at S3 Warmogs and S4 spring mastery Perseverance).  Perhaps the tank class lacks the right kit mechanics to allow them to utilize tanky items sufficiently better than offensive bruisers to make them competitive.  Designing more selective items is the simplest approach, but I remember in S2 you did go back and individually work defensive scaling into most of their kits.

Attack Speed? or some Armor, since we don't have many Cloth Armor build routes atm, could work for that niche ?  \n\nLet me explain :  The main problem with Tank Junglers is, as you said, they cannot allow themselves to go damage because they need to tank, but they can't allow themselves to go tank early because it slows them down too much. Considering most tank Junglers have high base damage skills and low ratios (because they are tanks), if you make them level faster, the threat they output is bigger, even if they don't necessarily have much if any offensive items.

People like Zed, Annie, LeBlanc, Darius, Garen, Kennen, etc. Suffer a lot because of that simple fact : they can't do shit about her at level 6, even if they worked hard for it, in most cases. At least make it so it costs something the first two levels : 100/50/0 or something.\n\n\n2) There isn't enough downtime/too much uptime on Righteous Fury. Basically, at level 1 with no CDR, there is a 6 seconds window for people to harass her, and people often will have enough CDR to almost always have it up. In lane it allows her to farm, deny farm, harass relentlessly (mainly because her Q slows a freaking ton and you don't want to stay there getting shredded to tears). Only two more seconds of downtime would do wonders. You could also make her Melee Form a bit more significant and her Ranged Form a bit less by either extending the Melee's Range to, say, 150, and reducing her Ranged Form range.\n\n\n\n{{champion:24}} It's quite simple actually : His early game is TOO safe/strong. \n\nWhen you have such a snowbally Champion, you can't afford to let him have a Jump (that he can do on almost anything), a freaking ton of early damage, a sure outrade potential at level 6, and an AoE stun that also voids out all basic attacks in the Channeling. Hell, one could say that he could be countered by Magic Champions like Vlad, or Kennen with that in mind, but lo and behold his E also reduces AoE damage. \n\n\nSo you have a lot of options here : \n\n\n\n1) Make him unable to Jump to Wards. This would make it so Jax players have to play a bit more cautious if no minion waves are incoming. Or increase the early Cooldown of Leap Strike (which would also reduce his \"harass\" potential).\n\n\n2) Remove his E's AoE reduction -> Give him tenacity or something instead. \n\n\n3) Rebalance his Ult's damage portion for a better late game, weaker early : 80/160/240 from 100/160/220.\n\n\n\n{{champion:115}} His Sieging/Clearing is too strong. \n\nIn ALL phases of the game, this guy can single-handedly retaliate against the heaviest of pushers, and make the defenses of the sturdiest Champions crumble by simply throwing high damage/highly spammable bombs, zoning engagers/fleers (or clearing some more) with a large, -too- long-lasting minefield, and get out/push away with a genuine Satchel Charge. O and let's not even talk about his high range, high damage, lowish Cooldown Ult. He's not just too safe. He's too safe for what impact he has on a game which is almost as obnoxious as last patch's Nidalee (he does take a bit more skill though, so that's why he's ALMOST as obnoxious). \n\n\nThis makes me sad cause it's one of my favorite Champions, but here's the gutting process : \n\n\n1) Reduce Bouncing Bomb's Range to 800-1350 from 850-1400 AND/OR Reduce Bouncing Bomb's base Damage to 65/110/155/200/245 (+0.6 AP) from 75/120/165/210/255 (+ 0.65 AP).\n\n\n2) Hexplosive Minefield will last 6 seconds, down from 10. It's the highest duration zoning tool, but one could wonder if that's really needed on someone with so much poke potential. \n\n3) Potentially increasing his Ult CD at all levels could be an option in the long run if he stays strong, but maybe not now.\n\n\n4) On the other hand : Increase Satchel Charge's AP ratio to 0,5 from 0,35. So if Ziggs players want to sacrifice their main escape tool, they feel it's a bit more worth it.\n\n\nI don't have any ideas concerning {{champion:157}}. But I'm sure concerned about his power level, especially since last patch buffed Shiv/IE. \n\n\n\nNo {{champion:25}}  changes incoming ?

When balancing the game, we try to strike a balance between balancing for pro play and balancing for our average player, which means that sometimes we have to take a swing at a character even when they're trending downward in the professional arena.  Jax might be struggling a bit in competitive, but he's still causing a lot of frustration for a lot of players.\n\nLulu and Ryze are on our radar, but we're still trying to work out some of the larger issues that are currently deleting the laning phase from competitive play, which, if successful, would potentially change the landscape of these picks.","replies":[{"poster":"igogvpHP0f","date":"2014-06-20T06:44:36.272+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":5,"body":"I don't understand the logic behind this either. You haven't even given professional players time to adapt on 4.10, which was a very hard indirect nerf to champions like Jax due to the TP nerfs and the MASSIVE (I repeat, MASSIVE) doran's blade nerfs to melees. \n\nYou're assuming he's still going to be good in 4.10 when he already wasn't prioritized over ranged champions in OGN, and even when he was picked he had a VERY low negative win rate in the LCS. Bruisers are already being completely phased out of top lane in favor of ranged champions like Lulu/Kayle and nothing is being done about it. This is going to be EXACTLY like season 3 in which Riot literally let bruisers sit in a horrible spot for about half a year to the point where they were unplayable. They already get destroyed by ranged champions in lane for the most part because ranged champions in this game are allowed to have everything for some reason: damage, safety, utility, teamfight presence, etc. It blows my mind that instead of realizing how overloaded ranged champions are in this game you nerf any melee that can actually survive to do anything (see Olaf, and Jax). Here's a hint: you can't win a game with 5 melee champions at a top level because you'll ALWAYS need a ranged AD. You can win a game with 5 ranged champions if you have someone like Elise or Fiddle jungling. It's happened in competitive play many times. \n\nYou guys already deleted damaging bruisers from the game at a top level. The only good one left is Jax and that's only because he has enough steroids to do anything. Their itemization has been nerfed to the ground, mallet now is even being considered to be deleted, the champions stand no chance vs ranged champions in lane, so they're stuck building full tank. All of season 4 has been dominated by either full tank or 1 damage item and full tank builds top lane. The only melee who has broken that trend has been Jax. Ranged champions dominate bottom lane, they dominate mid lane, the only lane left for melees is top lane, and even that is being dominated by ranged champions. Instead of helping melees, you nerf the ones that can succeed despite all of this ranged tyranny. God Bless\n\nIf you're solely nerfing champions because of their performance in uncoordinated play then you'll never let the game evolve. People NEED to learn how to deal with champions to be able to get better at the game, and they can't if you don't even give them a chance. Jax is currently 4-11 in the LCS and is about to be 4-12, and this is on patch 4.9, before the massive doran's blade nerfs and the TP nerfs. You people need to stop moving so fast.

Once you get shiv or even just zeal you can 1v1 pretty much every midlaner with few exceptions ({{champion:90}}). If you have 5% crit chance, flat armour, flat mr, and some ad runes, with doran's blade start you can first blood 70 % of the games at lvl 2. So you have few paths of doing things. You can:\n\n* Lower his base armour, mr and hp so that he'l have to hide in a corner for the first few minutes,\n* Make his passive crit increaser scale with levels/ult points/ or even windwall (makes you want to put some points in w making you deal less dmgs from q and e)\n* Make his flow shield trigerrable by normal minions, so that when he takes aggro after poking with q the opponent can do something (q range is ridiculous against melee champions).\n* Reduce hitbox on third q (the tornado)\n* His wind-wall. It is not op because he can block projectiles. It's op because he casts it near him, then it travels further. Make it 'spawn' further away and not cancel projectiles that are already going through him. Every Person with good reflexes can easily block even those fast projectiles like blitz's q or nidalee's spear, even without previous vision on them.\n* Again his W. The trick that we Yasuo players really like to do is to set the windwall somewhere during the fight, and just kite around it, which is very easy because of his dash (someone is trying to pass the wall ? Dash through them .-.). So, make the wall either stay up for a shorter time, or make it block projectiles from only one side.\n\nI really like this champion, he's so much fun to play, especially if you master wall jumping with jungle creeps, and he can be used to make ridiculous outplays. Please don't make him useless. And don't use all my suggestions if you will read this post, I would personally just do one of them or two. And remember that Yasuo with 3800+2800 = ~7k gold, and you have full crit chance, good as, and crit dmg from ie's passive.\n\nMaybe create an armour item with crit dmg reduction ?\n\nJust don't make him die like Yorick.\n\nSorry for my English and such, and i hope that my post helped .-. .","replies":[]},{"poster":"jZk30piP5w","date":"2014-06-20T13:07:02.629+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think Riot is looking at all these nerfs the wrong way. \n\nFirst off Kayle does do lots of damage, but her ult if probably the most annoying thing in the game right now. The CD on that thing is just insane and it costs no mana to cast... late game every skirmish or team fight is is saving an enemy from being caught out because you waste everything to kill someone and they just walk away like nothing. While doing all this Kayle still dishes out damage from insane range.  If you make her CD's a lot longer to where she must choose when to use ult and when to save it for maybe a dragon fight in the next minute or 2 i think it would give some massive counter play to her.\n\nNext up we have Jax, the guy is maybe too strong in lane right now, but isn't that late game monster people think he is.  He often times gets blown up or locked down so hard late game that he actually becomes rather just a split push machine (same as Tyrn) if you tone down Jax's laning maybe consider a R active rework that gives him tenacity and maybe less tank stats.  It will force people to buy aromor items but you wont be useless late game due to 1 or 2 CC's hitting you.\n\nNow we have Ziggs.  This champ does exceed at laneclear, but his ult just does too much damage.  People often can use it to clear a lane from half the map away and the CD at later levels is just too low.  If you would tone down the damage and increase the CD it would really stop people from just pushing 1 lane and ulting another to push 2 lanes at once pretty much.\n\nLastly we have Yasuo. Out of all these champs this is the one i play the most. If you force Yasuo to buy defensive items it will hurt him way too much. The only reason Yasuo is flourishing right now is because skill shot mages.  He is able to safely farm until about 10-15 min to get his bork or shiv and then dual you all because of windwall and being able to stop an all in or a skill shot reliant champos such as Nidalee or Leblanc.  Melee champs or high burst champs such as Diana, Malz, Riven, and maybe more do just fine against Yasuo and prevent him from farming efficiently enough to get him core items to become that \"Late Game Monster\".  Just because a certain champ falls into the meta doesn't mean you should nerf them. People see the pro's or someone in solo-q do well with these champs and begin to master them that's half the reason why they become FOTM in the first place.\n\nTLDR: Riot looking at nerfing these FOTM champs the wrong way, some aspects might be OP about them (Kayle, Ziggs) but they mainly just fall into the meta Riot themselves have created.","replies":[]}]}
