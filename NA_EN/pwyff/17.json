There should be a decision point there at least. If Soraka wants to tank, she has to give up some of that utility, like from Windspeakers.\n\n2.)

Tank junglers usually don't net in as much gold as more damage-oriented junglers because tanks dont focus on the farm-and-carry playstyle, rather they focus on snowballing other lanes and selflessly helping their team, which is why tank items have always historically been cheap.\n\nRuneglaive not only didnt get any stat compensation, but it got NERFED by 10 AP. This is a poor excuse for a nerf if this was targeted at Elise, because now Evelynn, AP Amumu, AP Ekko, Diana, and Nidalee suffer as well.

It's second passive of turning damage you take into a bleed instead is certianly quite interesting, but overall i think it's not going to be stronger than any lifesteal that is available in the game right now.  Considering Death's dance will only heal you for 12%, and then 4% of the damage when using spells that hit multiple targets, compare that to BT where you can get 20% lifesteal instead. Cooldown reduction is also alot more easy for marksmen to get with the new Essence Reaver, so that pushes marksmen away from the item even more. All that said, the second passive may be enough to justify buying it/may be a stylist choice for some players, but I think there are definitely atleast some trade-offs. Perhaps something a midlane varus might like, or an ezreal, but it's definitely not going to make any character indestrustible.\n\nAs for the new PD, that does sound strong to me, and will really help when dealing with a single frontliner like a shyvana/mundo who are just running at your face trying to melt you.
