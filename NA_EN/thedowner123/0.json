So I left the game and wanted to go back in the game. But i was in the client (Home of the client with Loot and Store and Profile etc.). Our wifi is working fine no issues. I can go on youtube and google etc. Is there a bug or something with the client? If i get a 20 minute queue timer, can you please remove it. It's not I was inting or some shit. Please fix this Riot Employess.\r\n\r\nThank you! :)\r\nIGN: TheDowner123","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2017-08-24T17:55:55.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm....just to clarify, when you got the \"Attempting to Reconnect\" pop-up in your ARURF game, and left, did you not see the option to get back into the game when you got back into the client?  Is there any record of this match appearing in your match history page?\n\nIf it seems like the game was never actually played, I think you might have hit a new bug introduced with Ornn.  Some of Ornn's abilities, when interacted with other champions, could cause the game to completely crash for all players (as if it never happened).  This bug should already be fixed or fixed in the very near future, so hopefully you won't encounter it again!\n\nIf anything comes up again, feel free to hit me back up!","replies":[{"poster":"DDPimp","date":"2017-12-09T18:25:50.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok so i que i get the group it goes to launch the loading screen of the actual game and....nothing dosent even do that...the button RECONECT is sat there and dose jack s*** mno matter how many timews yoyu opush it , iv logged out and relogged, iv rebootewd my comp, iv switched regions for the updates and back again, iv repaired the damn files......and now guess what!!!? thats right im now got reported for afk'ing games because.....what...i dont know know and neither dose any body else","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mr1111","date":"2017-08-25T04:12:01.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it happened same to me and i cant play any games neither on my nordic nor eu west accounts. i just came here to see if it's only me because all my friends are playing without any problems.
