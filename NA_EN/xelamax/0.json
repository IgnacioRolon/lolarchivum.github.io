It happens multiple times a day. Sometimes the button will light back up again and all I needed to do is wait, but it doesn't always come back real quick. It's especially frustrating when playing a lot of games with friends, but invites are put on hold because of this weird play thing. I don't want to waste time waiting to see if the \"Play\" button will come back on its own, so I just relog. Sometimes it's still grey when I relog and relog again. It's getting real irritating.","replies":[{"poster":"TzaGear","date":"2017-03-24T21:05:04.057+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add 2 others with a stable connection having the same problem.

I completely uninstalled and reinstalled League of Legends. One of the patches must have loaded weird. Since reinstalling, I haven't had my play button go grey for no reason, but I'm on the lookout for it just in case.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-22T18:36:53.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the Play button is intermittently going grey then you could be facing an unstable connection that's basically causing you to lose your pulse with the client.

My husband and I run off the same internet, both hardwired in at up to 40 mb. He gets it occasionally too, but we never have trouble in a game, and our connection checks out fine.  We aren't losing anything. Our internet's been working fine during our games. It's happening to a friend of ours as well in a different part of the country. Started happening to us a couple patches ago.","replies":[]}]}]}
