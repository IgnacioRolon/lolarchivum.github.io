While hotspots are great for being able to get internet access on the fly wherever you are, they really aren't going to work very well for online pvp gaming where you need to maintain a stable connection. You aren't able to see the Match Found message in time due to the lag between your network and your phone hotspot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HeyImBasix","date":"2017-07-23T19:46:02.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You probably need real internet lol, not gonna be a problem with your PC. Your ISP and Riots servers are most likely having problems sending info between the two and so that's why the \"Match Found\" screen isn't popping up for you in time to accept it.","replies":[]}]}
