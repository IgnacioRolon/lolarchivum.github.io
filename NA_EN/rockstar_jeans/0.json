The step to use \"lol.launcher.admin\" helps because it forces an exception.  \n\nDeleting files is unnecessary, though, and will only force the patcher to repair.  \n\nI suggest going over the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to re-configure your settings and allow an exception towards a more permanent fix.
