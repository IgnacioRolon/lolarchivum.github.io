Yes, she is extremely mobile and can be nearly impossible to kill if you are chasing her through the jungle. But the rest of the time she doesn't have it so easy. Her playstyle requires her to get into danger continuously. Nearly all her combo's require her to get on top of the enemy champion/s.

It might be balanced at okay at the challenger level where everyone has 20 ping,  but when you're playing with 80 ping for example,  you pretty much have to time in your head when he's going to land.  It feels brutal as ahri to get ulted by a zed that you know you can kill once you land your charm,  to fire your charm as soon as he appears,  only to see it slide through a shadow.  \n\nHonestly,  if zed/lb had even a full 1 second after appearing where they couldn't jump to safety,  I'd love playing against them.  It's why I like playing against fizz,  at least there are windows of counterplay opportunity to wreck his face.  It feels like against zed/Lb though,  they get risk free huge burst damage with little skill.  It's harder to land an ahri charm or Syndra stun on a non-mobile champion than it is for zed/LeBlanc to land their full combo on a mobile champion (I mean,  death mark is targeted,  right? ). \n\nThat all said I don't think either is OP.

This is true for EVERY game.  I don't think there's anything wrong with these champs because they all require you to play strategically in their own way, and they have counters (see Akali vs Fizz).\n\nThe problem is some people don't like playing those counters, and instead like champs like Xerath; who gets destroyed by Leblanc.  So what will the Xerath player do?  Complain.\n\nContrary to what many here seem to say, variety is good!  I don't want to play a game where everyone is the same, where everyone has the same exact weakness.  I like games where variety is plentiful, even if some characters are harder to deal with.  And I never understand why people go, \"PLS RITO DELETE THIS CHARACTER!\".\n\nGuess what?  Even if Zed is deleted, you'll all complain about Yasuo.

Ranked isn't the only game mode, and Riot has expressed their dissatisfaction in counterplay during the champ select screen.\n\n- Variety is a good thing, I agree. Rek'Sai is a very unusual champ and I like that she exists, since it opens up new options in playstyle. But it is a strawman argument to say that nerfing Zed/Fizz/etc's damage to compensate for their utility will ultimately reduce variety. Their safe kit isn't necessarily the problem; the problem is their kit plus VERY high damage output.\n\n- No comment I have seen so far said that these characters should be removed from the game. Instead, everyone is talking about how annoying they are to play against. What I am suggesting is a nerf, something more than what they did to Lee and less than what they did to Cass.","replies":[{"poster":"meatjunjun","date":"2014-12-14T19:18:14.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yes you can't counterpick in blind pick matches, but I just get the feeling that many who complain on these posts don't adjust their strategies to the people/champs they're facing.\n\nI come from a background of fighting games (ie Street Fighter, Marvel vs Capcom, Blazblue, etc), and we also have very difficult matchups.  Because like lane phase of LoL, fighting games is about 1v1 duels.\n\nThe difference is, I seriously think people want to play ONE play-style, and if their opponent counters it, they don't try something different.  They expect that whatever strategy that should work against X champion should also work on Y champion.\n\nUltimately, this is a team game, and if you're stuck in a back matchup, play lane in a way that you'll go even.  Maybe you'll lose out on some cs, but at least you won't die.  This should also mean that you should be closer to your tower, and you can ask for a gank.","replies":[{"poster":"EfficientDynamo","date":"2014-12-14T19:59:32.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you that people need to always be ready to adapt to difficult opponents. But as a counterexample, lets take Malzahar (someone I enjoy playing with). His E lets him farm from a distance, but in order to set it he must get relatively close (650 range) to the minions and make sure that the affected minion dies so the damage goes on to the next minion.\n\nIf I am farming under tower and fizz wants to dive me, his E will give him an 800 range untargetable jump to me, and his Q will let him dash out through a minion. My only hope is to hit him with my ult before I die, or that my jungler is not occupied with helping other lanes and can 2v1 him with me.\n\nSo yes, I have to play much more cautious against a Fizz than I would a Yasuo, but even then there is a significant possibility that he can turret dive me and get a kill with only lichbane. I think that this level of safety is inappropriate in an assassin. If he was a tank like Leona, fine. Leona can get in and CC me to hell, but then she has to rely on her health/resistances to get out rather than just jumping out with maybe 1 or 2 turret hits.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
