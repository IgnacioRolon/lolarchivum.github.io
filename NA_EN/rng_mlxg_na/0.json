Riot needs to check the report smarter. I got banned by intentional feeding but the truth is someone banned my jg champion and laughing at me. I just want to give him one lose to punish him, how Riot locks up my account? I had only fed one game in total and i did this action only want to punish him. Please tell me what I did wrong?","replies":[{"poster":"Sardonic Sloth","date":"2017-07-30T15:43:25.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is correct, but do not forget, the next ban after a 14 day ban will be a permaban, so you should clean up your behaviour.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-29T22:56:08.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even though you were only intentionally feeding in one game, that still had an impact on the rest of your team since they were forced to play through that entire match with one of their own team members playing against them. It's always good to have a backup champion, since there are now 10 bans in some game modes which raises the chance of your go-to being banned. Keep in mind as well, your favorite champion getting banned doesn't excuse inting or afking.","replies":[{"poster":"RNG Mlxg NA","date":"2017-07-30T02:45:08.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So after they unlock my account, i need to start lv up my honor system from lv 1 and my rank is still there and not dropping right?","replies":[]}]}]}
