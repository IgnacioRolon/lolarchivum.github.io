And were those funds charged back? And you're certain that it's the same account? Other than that, I wouldn't see why anything should disappear, even if you stopped playing for any amount of time. I stopped playing for nearly if not more than a year before, and nothing disappeared.","replies":[{"poster":"go yas they said","date":"2017-08-28T02:52:23.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's weird.
