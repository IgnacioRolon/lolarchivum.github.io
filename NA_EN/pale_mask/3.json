It really helps put the \"Legend\" in \"League of Legends.\" I immediately started wondering what else you guys could do with this sort of storyteller style format. You could have a Freljordian telling stories of the old gods, the devilish Watchers and their servants, and of the mighty heroes of the land. Or a member of Malzahar's cult giving their perspective on the monsters from the Void, and the fools who would oppose them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-05-31T20:27:55.967+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can personally say that I'm excited to see what all you guys will do with these audio dramas. I especially love that you're starting off strong by using regular Runeterrans as storytellers for these (tell Lars he was amazing), but I have a feeling you guys know there's still room for particularly interesting stories to tell through audio dramas.\n\nJust as an example, it'd certainly be interesting to see a first-person narrative with a Champion with, more or less, many voices (Darha/Karma,  Kayn, Varus come to mind - Varus especially) told in this style.\n\nDefinitely looking forward to what you guys'll do with it down the road, though!","replies":[]},{"poster":"UltÃ®ma","date":"2018-06-01T02:51:53.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WE.
