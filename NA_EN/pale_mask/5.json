Veigar is linked to Noxus and Bandle City. Nocturne is linked to both the spirit world and shadow magic, which is currently kept in Ionia and was used to cause destruction during the Rune Wars.\n\nThe Rune Wars came after the Great Darkin War. The Darkin were created by Targon, who are fighting the threat of Icathia and the Freljord, where the Void stirs from its slumber. Mordekaiser wants his fortress back, and is rallying large portions of the Shadow Isles under his banner. LeBlanc is pulling the strings in numerous countries for an unknown purpose.\n\nIonia and Shurima, both linked to Targon, and, through it, the Freljord, are linked to Noxus, which Demacia is linked to. Demacia is seemingly beset by demons (two of which are brought forth into the world during the Rune Wars), and houses the world runes, which Ryze is protecting. Ryze is linked to Mordekaiser and LeBlanc (who both come from the Noxii tribes), the Shadow Isles (through Tyrus), and several parts of the world thanks to the world runes. Even Bilgewater is linked to the main storyline through Tahm Kench (link to demons and the Rune Wars), Fizz (link to Bandle City), Nagakabouros (link to the spirit world), the Shadow Isles and Noxus.\n\nThat&#039;s all not to mention the vastayashai&#039;rei, shadow magic and Syndra, which are kept in Ionia (&quot;the First Lands&quot;), Piltover and Zaun, and the &quot;great darkness&quot; that Swain foresees.\n---\nThe puzzle is coming together. Everything is linked to something else. Even the smallest character&#039;s actions can have major reprecussions on the future of the universe. The Watchers are waking up. Perhaps there&#039;s something darker still waiting from beyond them?","replies":[{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2018-10-25T19:24:21.475+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"To be fair:\n\nEventually the Void is going to come, and everyone will have to stop their petty squabbles to protect the planet itself.","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2018-10-25T22:37:09.581+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Then we defeat it and wait one MMORPG for it to half-return, then we wait 4 expansion packs for its finale.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-10-26T00:34:07.124+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"What's a planet?","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2018-10-26T07:03:31.841+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:136}}: \"There is a saying on this planet - \"Dumb as a rock\".

It's not _living_ things they care about. They want to destroy all _matter._ Many of the Voidlings like to eat and/or incorporate living things into themselves, but the Watchers simply want to get rid of the existence that contrasts their lack thereof.

Noxus is merely the city that spawned around his former prison after Mordekaiser's death, and you also cannot claim that Veigar will so willingly present himself back to the monster that tortured him for lord knows how many years.

Veigar is clearly opposed to tyrants and evil sorcerers, and won&#x27;t ally with Mordekaiser should he return; rather, he will directly oppose him.\n\nVeigar doesn't oppose tyrants and evil sorcerers intentionally. Veigar wants power, and he wants more magic at his disposal, therefore, he is conquering those who are in power in areas, but those people also happen to be tyrants and evil sorcerers. I don't think he'd discriminate if an area was controlled by a good mage - he'd still try to conquer them and take their powers for himself.\nAnd obviously, he wouldn't ally with Mordekaiser. But you're assuming he would actively try to directly oppose him, which we've been given no indication of. Mordekaiser kept Veigar in captivity for years, if not decades or centuries, to the point where he corrupted a Yordle. That's no small feat, and I cannot imagine that Veigar would actively seek to present himself to his captor again. I think Veigar would accrue power very far away from Mordekaiser, and only deal with him if Mordekaiser was on his doorstep. I don't think Veigar is altruistic enough to hear that \"Hey Morde is alive again\" and then rush off to try to kill him.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"RyzeTheSmurfMage","date":"2018-10-25T19:42:47.629+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Btw I missed it how is Ryze linked to Mordekaiser except for the fact that he was born in Noxii teritories?","replies":[]},{"poster":"abca98","date":"2018-10-26T18:54:03.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"My question is: do people still summon the champions to solve conflicts?
