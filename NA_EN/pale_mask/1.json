It appears that his sorcerors did too good a job of mightifying him after he died.","replies":[{"poster":"Dyromic","date":"2019-05-30T14:26:11.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, he only enchains those spirits he himself kills or those who are killed near to him. Other souls can still access the afterlife, so Morde's Death Realm is something like a smaller area in the greater realm of the Afterlife.\n\nThe existence of the Shadow Isles and the fact those spirits are not controlled by Morde makes it clear that Morde is not Death's only master and someone after his death won't necessarily be doomed for eternal servitude (or at least not under Morde). Sion is another example of an undead who is not controlled by Mordekaiser.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Frostfel","date":"2019-05-30T02:31:42.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just imagine a Sahn-Uzal skin for Mordekaiser, would be epic.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rowanstar","date":"2019-05-29T20:08:04.124+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The bio is great but 2 things I liked about the old one: Mordekaiser always being his name (Although technically it was anyways so....and I like that his old mortal self died and he was reborn).
