However, a lot of backstory uses vague terms like &quot;decades&quot; and &quot;centuries&quot; to describe events without ever giving a definitive number.\n\nIn some cases, a war or champion biography takes place long ago and is described in such a way to appear mythical, but world-changing events like the Watchers&#039; defeat or Xerath&#039;s ascension are probably big enough to have an official date. The old lore, for instance, had events have their dates.\n\nSo, are we getting it any time soon?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-07-30T14:54:15.040+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you...

Now that the large portion of the map is finished they can focus a lot of the effort into finishing up the timeline.
