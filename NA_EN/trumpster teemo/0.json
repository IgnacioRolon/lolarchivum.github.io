I have some thoughts to share with you, Riot Games, and to the entire League of Legends community. My first thought is to address the general community conditions as they stand at present time (at the time of writing this). As I have seen over the years of playing League of Legends (Myself starting in early 2014), the community has been growing and ultimately manifesting itself into a plethora of hate-filled communication and in most games, complete disrespect by and between other players as the result. It is very, very, very rare to find a complete non-hate filled game with the community&#039;s current status as a whole. Comments that are generally portrayed as negative attitude, verbally abusive, and hate speech, are abundant in almost every game I queued into and played in the past. To take that into perspective by sourcing current conditions from the community and to apply them against a respectful and honest decent new player, the two will not mix well at all, as it has not in the past. I have known a few past friends who started playing this game around the time I have started, and once respectful and decent, have grown into complete disrespectful, hate-filled, and verbally abusive individuals as  a direct result. Along with that, they no longer cared for anyone else but themselves and I disassociated myself from them for the sake of my own sanity, which in my point of view has taught me that such a community with the above described conditions can really change a person, and not for the better. The Tribunal system currently in place may catch many unsportsmanlike players and provide them penalties for their behavior, but in my perspective, it most definitely seems that such words are never taken back, and once the penalties are over, if it were a time duration, they typically only refrain from negative hate-filled communication to prevent themselves from being penalized once more, if not the final time. The damage dealt by the manifested hate-filled majority of the community is undo-able, and the affected will in return, deal damage via communication in another game, platform, or even under another League of Legends account. My second thought is to address the investments much of the community has made into League of Legends and also merchandise in physical form. I have noticed others who have invested a lot of time, and in most cases, money into a free-to-play game for access to level boosts, cosmetics, in-game appearances, and many other items available in the in-game store and elsewhere with Riot Games as the merchant. To bring along the first thought into this, with a much hate-filled community, it only takes one or two games of becoming negatively stressed to the point of becoming retaliation oriented as a direct result from other players who chose to write hate-filled comments to other players, to get penalized. Once a player retaliates back to those parties, in matter of self-defense or what many may consider to be justice, what was potentially a large investment of time and money, can be gone in almost an instant. Let&#039;s say, years and years of playing League of Legends, and an individual enduring many hate-filled comments over this period of time, it almost never fails to bring out what is sometimes the worst in someone, and usually over time, or even all at once. And this player invested so much to try to have fun, whether time, money, most cases both, ended up running directly into the result of being penalized due to the community&#039;s ultimate negative influence into individuals who play the game. My third thought of this, taking the first two into account, are the pricing of said cosmetics and in-game appearances. Many of the prices for these appearance items are majorly over-priced, even for a free-to-play game. To think about how much one, as many have, invested in the many items in the in-client store just to run into the fate of eventually being penalized, is mentally devastating, as many actually have been through being penalized, when the initial purpose of playing the game itself is to have fun, to pass the time, or any other reason, comparable to any other game. Since the game&#039;s official release in the year of 2009, millions and millions of dollar-equivalent funds have been invested into the game by the community, which is undoubtedly good in terms of business, but when this taken into perspective as described above, it can leave investments into the game completely to waste by those who have been plagued by and/or have been plaguing the community. I have seen others write to Riot Games, asking for account access to be returned to players who have been penalized under the Tribunal system, or by Riot Games in some cases, but to no avail of anything being returned to such penalized players. One or two mistakes can lead to hundreds, or even thousands of dollar-equivalent funds to waste. My fourth thought is the response from Riot Games on the matter of what the community has manifested into, the negative-filled player base itself. When I started playing the game, I myself, if I recall properly, remember a 5-Game Chat Restriction, 10-Game Chat Restriction, maybe a 20-or-so Game Chat Restriction, a 2-Week Account Ban, and a Permanent Account Ban. Recently, this system has been overhauled into a 10-Game Chat Restriction, a 25-Game Chat Restriction, a 2-Week Account Ban, and a Permanent Account Ban. In my perspective, I see this as a perhaps very minimal effort after receiving suggestions of the community and then action taken by Riot Games itself to mitigate the issue of negative hate-filled, verbally abusive, and hate-speech communication. The reason I see this as a minimal effort of mitigation is due to my witnessing of almost every game being filled with such hate-filled communication, much of which is resulting in zero penalties being provided to those individuals after the game and the minimal waiting period window for the Tribunal to analyze the reported players, and if the game itself embedded with the communication of the reported players ever reaches the Tribunal. My fifth thought is the balancing of in-game mechanics and champion statistics and abilities. Many of the champions are either under-powered or over-powered, which, in my perspective, makes the game play itself overwhelming to the player base. It may seem the only reasonable choice is to select the easiest, most over-powered champion or champions against other players to win. Much of the game is now who can directly counter another player, as whoever counters last in champion selection for each respective lane will in most cases win based solely on what champion or champions are selected. This provides what seems to be a very potentially hostile environment between player versus player combat itself but can also directly contribute to negative communication from the player losing to the player winning, the reverse, or in many cases both. I also noticed the freedom of what players chose to build in matches is now mentally restrictive in most cases due to potential abuse by other players, who feel they, the mentally restricted, are causing the entire team to lose the match, directly contributing to negative communication. Many enjoyable game mechanics have been removed or altered from their respective original mechanics to reduce the overall enjoyment out of the affected champions and the overall game itself. The leveling process to the ability of playing ranked matches has been shortened greatly, enabling new players, or players with another account or other accounts, to reach this level. This allows hate-filled communication by other players from these much newer accounts to result in other players being verbally abused and sometimes with directed hate-speech. These players with newer accounts are without much thought themselves of receiving penalties due to possession of many accounts, or even veteran players to be playing with and against these much newer players further resulting in negative communication. At the leveling system&#039;s current rate of progression, it only takes perhaps 2 weeks of almost constant playing, accounting for daily sleep and what not, to reach the level of playing ranked games. This allows the complete integration of typically very new players or hate-filled veterans of the game to directly influence the overall content of players. When I put these five thoughts together, I have reached the ultimate conclusion of Riot Games, the game League of Legends itself, and the community that drives it. In my perspective, the community is filled with too much hate-filled communication to enjoy almost any game without having hate-filled messages directed at the average player. The amount of time players have invested and the amount of money spent by players for the game full of hate-filled players in the community is by far the worst form of investment structure when it is far too easy to get penalized in a game or two of retaliation towards those originating the hate-filled communication. The pricing in the in-client store is too high for simple cosmetics and in-game appearances, and as a result, adding up to hundreds if not thousands of dollar-equivalent funds for a handful of such items. The response from Riot Games is much too minimal to directly mitigate the problem of a hate-filled community in a very competitive game; it is near, if not, impossible to resolve the hate-filled communication issue without completely removing the competitiveness from the game, which in itself would be a paradox. It is naturally and typically infuriating to players when they lose against another player, especially with the condition of the community in mind and potentially abusive communication. Therefore this can only result in the sole  logical option of responding with much greater stiffening of the penalties for negative hate-filled communication and all of its respective sub-categories. The balancing of the game is very poor in its current state, leading to much dissatisfaction in my perspective and experience of playing the game, along with many, many others. And finally, to top all of this off, the game with its community is no longer fun nor enjoyable to interact with, without resulting in complete discontent and frustration due to the current state of game mechanics and the current state of the community. With all of this stated, my thoughts on this, and how I feel with my time and monetary investments, hoping to result as a fun and positive interaction with the community, has been completely destroyed and has left a deep mental scar that has affected myself and many, many countless others as the result of this game and community. My own personal monetary investment could have been much better allocated towards almost anything else which would have brought much more content and enjoyment, or even benefiting someone else in need. I can only hope for what is left of perhaps remaining decent players, before the hate-filled conditioning from the community reaches and influences them, will realize these critical points and take action for themselves, and perhaps actions to influence change for a much better and positively-thriving community, before it is too late for those individuals, and resulting in perhaps years of time passed and hundreds or thousands of dollar-equivalent funds invested with no positive return. With that I rest my thoughts and move on to much better things. --- Former League of Legends Summoner\r\n\r\nDated 12/10/2017 at 6:26 AM EST","replies":[]}
