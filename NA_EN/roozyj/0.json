I'm thinking of starting Mandarin this summer :)\n\nI hope I have helped. I realized that I sounded like a cad at the start and you wrote as though you did want to improve and I believe there is hope in passion. But before you jump into fanfic, **write what you know.** Then twist the memories into \"could have.\" Fiction writers are all about creating believable lies (okay and some non-fic, too haha). But hone that skill of storytelling first. Then add other stores of \"if this character were here... how would they actually react?\" Example: \n\nDraft 1: When I was five years old I truly believed there were crocodiles under my bed. My grandmother was talking to my auntie about someone terrorizing the young girls in the village by putting on crocodile masks and hiding under their bed. I haven't forgotten that story and now I keep a dozen boxes under my bed. \n\nDraft 2. When I was five years old my favourite activity at my grandmother's house was to sit at the top of her giant staircase and watch people walk below or listen to the adults speak in the sitting room or kitchen. I went to grandmother's house every weekend so Mom and Dad could have \"Special Time,\" whatever that was. One fine Saturday morning, after sleeping in and stuffing my tummy with Grandma Waffles,  I perched myself on top of that staircase like other weekends I spent there. My legs dangled from between the polished wood columns and over the wall. I was careful not to bang my heel into the wall. In my left hand I held a small pink doll and, in the right hand, I had a little red car. I swung my legs back and forth (carefully!) and listened to my grandmother and my auntie talk in scandalous tones.\n\n\"Did you hear what happened to Sander's daughter?\" My grandmother asked.\n\"No, I didn't,\" My auntie replied.\n\"Well, some young man shoved a crocodile mask on his face, hid under her bed, and waited until the evening to grab her legs! Scared her so bad she kicked him in the face and he lost a tooth!\"\n\"Why the hell would someone do that?\" \n\"Because kids these days are bored and stupid.\" \n\nI felt my eyes grow wide in my head. Not because my auntie used \"hell\" (even though I knew it was a Bad Word) but because my brain fantasized that crocodiles could live under someone's bed and grab their ankles. My five year old mind didn't register what a \"mask\" was, but it sure knew what crocodiles were. Giant lizards who would snatch little girls from under their bed just because they could. I made a vow that Saturday morning; my bed would always be crammed with boxes so no crocodile could ever fit there. I've stuck with that idea well into my 30's. Hell, my current bed doesn't even have a frame, just a couple mattresses on the ground with fluffy pillows on top. No crocs allowed. *\n\nIn the first draft I get the gist of the idea out. I get out the who, what, where and when, but not the how. I go back over the story to paint a worded picture of what I was doing at five to have caused me to overhear a story between the two women and how that story crept into my five year imaginative brain. Now we could 'Anne Rice' it and describe the exact details of the staircase, what kind of wood it was, how tall the staircase was, the layout of the house, what my grandmother and auntie were doing based on sounds, but it would take away the picture in the person's mind. And I don't want to be in Architecture Digest. (I love Anne Rice but she has a creepy fascination with house descriptions). The most I might add on the final draft is that they were in the kitchen, off to the side and I could hear dishes being moved around and the sound of water, drawing a conclusion they were washing the morning dishes. Or they could just be sitting at the table, drinking their tea and smoking cloves. To the five year old mind, however, it wouldn't matter, nor would it be something I'd remember. The conversation is what mattered. (To be fair I'm a technical writer, so I'm sure this is dry reading).\n\nNow let's take that into what you want to do- fanfiction of set characters. Give them a life before your story. Like in art, draw a pencil sketch, something you can erase at later points if you think their shirt doesn't fit right. How did their parents treat them? What kind of antics did they get involved? How many love interests have they  had? Has their heart been broken? What is the basic story of how they got to the point where you start their story. That's your outline. You can fill in the colours with your story progressing. \n\nWhen one of the characters  in your story is walking  to his car, listening to the paved parking lot crunch beneath his feet, what is he thinking? What is he feeling? Is he tired, annoyed? Hungry? _This is where you draw from your life_. Think about decisions you could have made to land in Hollywood. -Remember that time that girl in the 9th grade called you a \"loser\" because you wanted to try out for the main part in Fiddler on the Roof \"You couldn't get that part if you paid Miss Marsh.\" Miss Marsh was the drama teacher, old and crinkly, but kind in her own way. I stepped onto that stage and I sung my fucking heart out and you bet your ass I got the lead part and that 9th grade tart who called me a loser is now working at a fast food joint. But me? I got in. I got made. And now here I am, wondering if a part of me is a \"loser\" after all, trying to get this stupid film finished when all my actors are having drama queen parties instead of sticking to the damn script. - Now you've got a bit of anger with bitterness dashed into the character's frame of mind. \n\nWhen you draw your characters, there's a starting point right? One line, two lines, a half circle, a triangle... I love comics and graphic novels because the artist never knows where they are going just that they need to get there. The pen can take a mind of its own; let it. Let your memories and the people around you be your guide. If you can write fiction of your own life, you can write fiction of anyone's life (or just about.) And remember: the less said the better. People who love reading have active imaginations- push them into that direction and let their imagination flow. \n\n*The above story is true. The neighbor boy who got caught doing that broke his nose (not his teeth) and it was crooked for the rest of his life. We called him Croc and never let him escape his teenage antics. He ended up marrying the Sander's daughter :)","replies":[{"poster":"Roozyj","date":"2016-05-27T07:43:51.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, at first, I'd be really impressed if your Roman and Greek was actually better than your English, but cool :) I figured you were from the US, because your account is based in NA.

The point is that this fanfic isn't written well. It's fulfilling a sexual fantasy based on imaginary characters from a video game. And who says nothing is wrong with porn? There are as many studies to show how detrimental it is to people's health as much as mainstream wants us to believe it's okay. Regardless of that- it's against the board rules, and I am digressing. \n\nI have a degree in Liberal Arts and am, by definition, a professional writer. I gave King as an example so it would be understood that the lurid details of a sex scene does not make a story well written, or even the \"scene\" for that matter. If your goal is soft porn, then it's mostly okay but it's still very redundant in many parts. I'm  not going to point them out here on this forum as I would be breaking the rules.\n\nHere are some books for helping you with writing, if uni is out of the question.\n\n\n'The Elements of Style' - William Strunk and E.B. White\n'The Only Grammar Book You'll Ever Need' Susan Thurman Larry Shea\n'The Verbal Advantage' - Charles H Elster\n\n\n* Read more books in general; good books and bad books. Read the top sellers and read the shitty free novels from amazon. \n* Read until your eyes bleed. \n* After a first draft of any writing, you want to shove it away for about a week and relax on it. Pull it out again and go over with a giant sharpie and hone down what you want. Read it out loud while you go over the story's first draft- your ears are a better critic than your inside voice (the inside voice is always narcissistic). \n* Take the story to someone outside of your circle and ask them to be a critic. No one inside writing circles wants to be a \"jerk.\"  \n* Write everything but the sex scenes first- don't worry about those. If you don't have an actual character development before and after those scenes then all those scenes will do is confuse the reader and come out cheap and trite.\n\nEdit: I  had the reaction I did because of the writing. If I come across strong it's because I feel strongly about reading and books and stories and all those things. The world is full of shitty writers trying to peddle their b.s. I can't tell you how many people in my classes have said \"I'm taking English to write the next Harry Potter\" because all those people flunked out. Fanfic is the worst way to create stories. If you're serious about writing, **_write from your own experiences_**. I cannot stress that enough. If you've never been to Hollywood, or been on a set, how do you know what really happens? There are gaffs and lighters, cameramen, extras; hundreds of people and things on sets that make it a set. What are the thoughts of the people as they go to and from the set to the tables, to the dressing room, makeup room. How are they the way they are? What memories form when they are in between takes? Are the thinking of their bills, their next score, going on a vacation? These little details makes a character believable. Having faults, being sideways. When you take a character from a predefined universe you are stripping away who and what they were meant to be and putting them into a meta-box to fulfill a fantasy. There is no care in the writing, no care in the character development. That's what stands out, that's why I say it's redundant and tripe. Write a story without the sex first and see how far you get. Add those scenes in if they are necessary, but chances are kiss and the boots coming off works even better._ Let the reader have their imagination_. That is why we read books. We can fill in the gaps.

I'm the other person who wrote a bit in this particular fanfcition. To be honest, your look on this is quite understandable, though your reaction to it is a bit much. I guess you really don't like fanfcitions that much huh?\n\nI myself tend to look at fanfiction writing as a way to practice writing myself, since I'm not a native english speaker and learning how to write is as much as an art as learning how to draw. So relying on existing content helps a great deal; we had to do this also in school at the art Academy where we would make comics based on fairytales. For an instance, we had to make a comic from the perspective of the big bad wolf instead of little red riding hood. Which, could be considered a “fancomic”, since I really like the story and the characters. \nSo when you are saying the characters are wrong, you're right. They aren't the same, but that isn't also their setting, they are not in Runeterra. They are vague images of the characters they really were.\nIn my own story on the same account, Finding Peace, I'm actually trying to make Jhin, for example, really Jhin. Though I was unfortunate enough that I discovered the extra background story a little too late. But this makes good practice, because making mistakes and writing horribly means there is still too much to learn to give up on it.\n\nAnd yes, it is porn, there is nothing wrong with porn, everyone has sex. Well...Jhin doesn't, but that makes it funnier that he does.
