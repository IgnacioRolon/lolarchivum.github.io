In this case most of the roster is \"viable\".  \n\nDamage Dealers do not necessarily need to build full damage, champions like Hecarim, Olaf, Garen, Darius, and Volibear tend to build Bruiser, Juggernaut, or even full Tank. Their goal however is primarily to deal damage or they deal a lot of damage due to the nature of their kit (like Volibear who deals more damage based on his tankiness). These would fit under the category of Damage Melee champions.","replies":[{"poster":"TWITCHTV ERONATE","date":"2016-11-08T20:00:43.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't really mean viable, my bad, since he used the highest winrate stat i thought he meant viable as in strong. as you see i'm eu so my english is limited lol\n\nabout rudeness, i don't get offended that easily dw man xD if you wanna flame me just go on, free yourself\n\nI agree with you though, the champions you listed are bruisers and are meant to do damage, but nunu is a tank (from what i know, unless you go the titanic hydra build) and i don't think his damage is that special. His kit isn't revolved about damage compared to someone like hecarim who is meant to dive the backline and has abilities that help him do that. Nunu just soaks most of the damage and even though he's melee, I don't think you can call him a damage dealer.

It doesn't need to deal a lot of damage, but it is their primary goal. You are right though Nunu is not the best example, he is more of a tank than a damage dealer.
