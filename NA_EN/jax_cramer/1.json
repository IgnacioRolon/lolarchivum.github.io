I think they just spike too hard in certain times and ways. It's because we actually finally nerfed % pen to the point they are actual tradeoffs start of season 6. And that's why tanks were crazy first part of season 6. And then they knee jerk nerfed the resolve tree. But that wasn't the problem. So (imo) while it's a classic thing the game has that tanks are powerful mid game and (tbh) get dominated late game by carries I think this needs to be spread out a teensy bit.
