It&#039;s mostly that this keystone overall seems subpar and even ill-fitting for this slot when compared to another keystone in a completely different tree. \r\n\r\nLet&#039;s compare:\r\n\r\nGrasp of the Undying: Dealing or receiving damage in the last 2 seconds generates one stack every second. At 4 stacks, your next basic attack, within 6 seconds, against an enemy champion deals 4% of your maximum health bonus magic damage, restores 2% of your maximum health, and permanently grants 5 bonus health. The empowered attack duration refreshes whenever you deal or receive damage. (40% effectiveness on ranged champions)\r\n\r\nFleet Footwork: Attacking and moving builds energy stacks. At 100 stacks, your next basic attack is Energized. Energized attacks heal you for 3-60 (+0.3 bonus AD, 0.4 AP) and grant +30% movement speed for 1s. Healing is 60% as effective when used on a minion. Healing is increased by 40% of your critical damage modifier when triggered by a critical hit.\r\n\r\nGrasp of the undying grants 2 health and 4 damage for every 100 health a champion gains. At Level 18, Fleet Footwork&#039;s base healing surpasses that of a melee Grasp user until the latter accumulates over 3000 health. One can assume an absolute bare minimum of 2 health items were purchased to reach this health point, however. If the Fleet Footwork user were to buy... let&#039;s say {{item:3031}} {{item:3087}} the 60 heal would increase to 81 from Fleet&#039;s AD scaling. If the Energized attack so happened to be a critical hit (50% chance) then you could expect an heal of 129.6 instead. To reach this level of healing a grasp user must acquire just under 6,500 max HP.\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s not forget Energized attacks require no &quot;must be in combat for x seconds&quot; condition to activate, can be used on minions, and still stacks up quite nicely throughout a teamfight. In fact, the rate at which Energized attacks are acquired scales with attack speed and movement speed.\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s also mention that {{item:3094}} gives your auto attacks bonus range to trigger this heal from greater safety while also allowing the effect to come online 25% faster and activate when hitting structures.\r\n\r\nIt just seems so strange to me that the Precision Tree has a rune that&#039;s better for keeping a champion alive than the tree who&#039;s entire theme is &quot;Live Forever&quot;. Shouldn&#039;t a rune titled &#039;Grasp of the Undying&#039; make you harder to kill and heal more than a keystone titled &#039;Fleet Footwork&#039;?\r\n\r\nSure, grasp deals damage too but the movespeed from fleet footwork is surely more tailored towards survival than damage is right? Wouldn&#039;t damage be more appropriate on a tree whose theme is &quot;Become a Legend&quot; than one focused on survivability? it&#039;s not at all uncommon for Grasp of the Undying to deal more damage than it heals either.\r\n\r\nGrasp&#039;s Scaling\r\n\r\nGrasp is at it&#039;s strongest during the laning phase as this is the point in the game where frequent, but smaller trades occur over a relatively long stretch of time and staying in combat comes naturally due to slow wave-clearing speeds and fewer enemies being present. Sadly, in a melee vs ranged matchup, the melee champ will make very little use of this keystone during this key period as they are at a considerable disadvantage. The keystone generally starts falling off in the mid game unless teamfights are breaking out 24/7. Grasp&#039;s effects aren&#039;t typically being utilized much or possibly even at all for that matter during the mid to late game. This is because minions are cleared out quickly by ranged champions - resulting in a general inability to stay &#039;in combat&#039; before attacking an enemy once to get a good trade- and everyone generally ends up staying further back from the opposing team in order to stay safe from hard engages and/or poke damage. The end result of the inability to stay in combat and the increased threat of enemy focus fire creates an atmosphere where small trades (which end with an auto attack) over a 4 second time frame become quite a rare occurrence for melee champions.\r\n\r\nBut even during a teamfight, where you&#039;d think a keystone such as this would really shine, a champion will be lucky to get 2 instances of Grasp off since 8 seconds of constant &#039;in-combat&#039; time (and living to tell the tale) can be quite a lot to ask from any champion in this hyper damage-oriented game. Especially melee champions. \r\n\r\nInfinite Health Stacking\r\n\r\nI feel I need to add that the health stacking mechanic isn&#039;t something a melee champion can effectively rely on anyway since, as explained above, the effect will be primarily used during the laning phase of the game and, again, this is only when facing against another melee champion. Sure, the effect has no upper limit and can theoretically give your champion an ungodly amount of health but this is simply unrealistic. For a melee champion, if constantly in combat for every second of the game and activating Grasp&#039;s effect whenever possible then it would grant 75 bonus health per minute. This means after 10 minutes of 100% nonstop action of beating each other in the face would you accumulate 750 bonus health. But we simply know this is not how the game plays out. Actually, I&#039;d say that if you activate Grasp 35 times in a game as a melee champion then you probably did quite well that game as far as proccing the effect goes. Thirty five Grasp procs means your melee champion got rewarded 175 bonus HP. Not an awful number to be honest but this effect is so minute and overlooked that the actual health gain isn&#039;t shown in the champion stats tab when you press Ctrl+C or in the &#039;Runes&#039; tab in the post-game screen.\r\n\r\nRecap:\r\n\r\nThough Grasp&#039;s &#039;base&#039; heal is naturally superior, Fleet Footwork&#039;s scales significantly better and is activated far more easily.\r\n\r\nFleet footwork&#039;s speed boost is more survival-oriented than Grasp&#039;s damage.\r\n\r\nFleet footwork stays relevant throughout the game as it can be used against minions and does not require any sort of pre-requisite in-combat condition to activate.\r\n\r\nFleet Footwork constantly charges up while also allowing for quicker charging through attack speed and movement speed while Grasp has a static cooldown that resets upon not dealing or receiving damage.\r\n\r\nFleet footwork&#039;s energized effect can be greatly enhanced through a cheap item that certain champions do not have to meaningfully alter their builds or strategy to make use of.\r\n\r\nGrasp of the Undying ends up being less and less used as the game progresses while Fleet Footwork ends up being used more and more\r\n\r\nGrasp&#039;s health-stacking effect will typically be an extremely small bonus to a champion who takes it. Particularly so when a melee user is laning against a ranged champion.\r\n\r\nA Resolve Tree keystone commonly granting more damage than raw sustainability seem&#039;s extremely counter-intuitive.","replies":[{"poster":"Tyrone Lannister","date":"2018-03-04T05:10:59.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Old grasp before it got nerfed was actually good","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-04T05:01:36.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TL;DR Grasp sucks.\n\nAlways funny to see someone at 20m with that rune and \"total healing: 72\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silly Neeko","date":"2018-03-04T05:42:42.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Fleet footwork is for damage.

I often use it on my top laners that i feel need a bit of extra in-fight sustain..... best for champions that have a decent base damage or hp scaling anyways.\n\n Heck its like trying to compare that \"heal 12% of health on kill\" vs \"makes the next spell cast cost 0 and you gain mana\". It is for two different champions. Occasionally those champions overlap into a single champion, but they both get the job done just fine.","replies":[]}]}
