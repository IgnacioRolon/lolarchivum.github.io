So I am unsure of how to continue, I submitted a ticket almost a week ago, and have gotten no response. If you get your issue handled please don't forget me ^_^. If anyone from RIOT sees this message can anyone please give me any insight into this problem? Also, I was able to be logged into my old account using LOLfriends APP and talk to my friends until the day before all this happened, then when I tried to reset my password, thats when everything went downhill FAST!\n\nThanks.","replies":[]}]}
