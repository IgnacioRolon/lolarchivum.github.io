Ya its not that big a deal, just check it out on youtube but, come..on..\r\n\r\nYou see this epic painting of the skin but no actual in-game model\r\n\r\nAnd the chroma&#039;s you get this tiny tiny little window where can barely even tell what the heck your&#039;e looking at. \r\n\r\nTLDR; The lack of preview availability when it comes to buying skins/chromas has ALWAYS bugged me.\r\nIs it just me? Or is there anyone else out there that is annoyed by this? \r\n\r\n**THANK U FOR READING***\r\n***closertoinfinity***","replies":[]}
