Somewhere in the middle. If you straight up restricted Viktor from buying Rylai's his winrate wouldn't fall to 42.5%, because there would be good players who can no longer buy the item but are still good enough at the champ to win a large amount of games.

You are talking about entirely correlations. Viktor's winrate increase correlated with Rylai's being a more colon item. It also correlated with minor buffs and players learning Viktor. Viktor players skill levels also correlate with the amount he buys Rylai's. It's possible that Rylai's is marginally better and better players understand this marginal advantage and are more likely to exploit it, but would also be more likely to win than a bad player even if they didn't.\n\nI'm not arguing against it being important. What I'm saying is that there are probably other factors. It is true that more skilled Viktor players are more likely to build Rylai's. It is also true that sometimes Viktor gets crushed so drastically that he can't even finish Rylai's before the game ends. Both of these things also factor into Viktor's subpar winrate without Rylai's.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Goodnight Nunu","date":"2016-10-16T23:22:57.534+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":10,"body":"You know, he wouldn't need it if his delays weren't as abnormally high.\n\nNothing a few number tweaks wouldn't fix.","replies":[{"poster":"Nagoh Shan","date":"2016-10-16T23:55:36.971+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"So, then can we stop pretending mages don't need Rylai's and understand that if the item gets changed they will need adjustment.","replies":[{"poster":"Whiteeye Avelyn","date":"2016-10-17T00:17:59.367+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Honestly no champion should be 100% reliant on a item that's bad design because if anything happens to the idea it will broken the champion in question.

Most mages were one-shot machines, but after MYMU they're not anymore. What mages can do then? KITE. KITE AND KILL. It's a new meta for mages. Is it because Rylai is bad? Nope, it's because how MYMU changed mages and their items. \n\n> Seriously, anyone who thinks it should be a core part of a Mage&amp;#039;s build is either:\n> A) High\n> B) Dumb as heck\n> C) A masochist\n> or, most likely\n> D) A mage main\n> \n\nOr Riot desiger, because they made MYMU, they made Rylai as item without alternatives.\n\n> Can we all agree that at LEAST the AP and Slow should be lowered?\n>\n\nRight after mages will get better alternatives. First of all, Rylai nerfs will be direct nerfs to Brand and Malzahar.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CerealBoxOfDoom","date":"2016-10-17T01:17:20.911+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So basically instead of rylais you want to give mages so much damage that they will never need to slow you... think carefully","replies":[]},{"poster":"Anonagon","date":"2016-10-16T22:54:35.618+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would take it one step further and say that not only is slows on every ability not necessary, but its downright abusive and really shouldn't be in the game at all.\n\nThe ability to buy a permanent slow on an item (and yes, Frozen Mallet is a problem too, even if its only built on Gnar) is just not something that should exist.

I know, I know, I'm probably the only person in the world that actually plays her (partly because I can't help but love the champion herself, lore, personality, etc), but it feels like that you're relatively useless until you get Rylai's. Mostly because her only other form of CC is on an over-ten-second cooldown and it synergizes well with her Q. Plus, as others have stated, the health and AP really help in her build path when she doesn't really have an escape option (except Ult but that can't even be used reliably in fights as an escape). Protobelt helps this in some regard, but it's still a bit difficult.\n\nMy opinion? Give it much less AP and give it much more health. It's mainly an item to support your kit, anyway, so treat it as such. Those that love the health to keep a bit tanky and love the slow will still pick it up, but it should reduce the amount of mages picking it up because it has such high AP. Of course, another high AP item should be given back in compensation, but that's how it should go. \n\nI mean, look at Frozen Mallet, the AD alternative. It has like 30 AD and 700 health or something like that. Shouldn't Rylai's be similar?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Redaga","date":"2016-10-17T22:44:46.755+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Newsflash!:\nTheir kits were designed to work on their own.\"\nIs not happy with your comment {{champion:101}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2016-10-16T23:12:47.006+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"You are ignoring the most important reason why mages build Rylais, to counter the high mobility champions. This makes it a must buy for mages. \n\nPlus your argument is completely wrong on every side. Brand wants it to keep the enemies from moving apart so they take more damage from the AoE effects. Viktor wants them slowed to get hit again by the second burst of Death Ray. Syndra wants them slowed down to set up her multi-player stun. Nid doesn't really need it (simply because she is broken as hell), but it doesn't hurt. \n\nTo combat the huge mobility creep that has taken over the game, mages absolutely need to build it.
