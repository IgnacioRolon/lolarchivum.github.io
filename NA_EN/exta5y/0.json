I was gold 1 as support last season. Ive dreaded this dynamic queue and still do now. Here is my question and remember I have no duo partner or premade:\r\n\r\nQ. How is it that Im placed in Silver 2 yet gain 27 lp for each win further I have to play against golds and plats. Heres my proof. Why wasnt I just placed in Gold. I know i did bad on my provision, yet my hidden elo says otherswise. Would like some answer, possible from a Riot employee\r\nhttp://i1261.photobucket.com/albums/ii595/obscene1237/random_zpsyopi7beu.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-05-25T18:07:18.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Placements will almost always place you lower than you were last season.

You can see that it shows me as silver 2 instead of my gold rank i had last season","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-05-25T18:46:58.276+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok... _Takes a deep breath_\n\nNow first of all SrbLud's comment below is correct.  While there is a limit to whom you can be placed with based on your rank, this doesn't set in until Diamond and higher.  As such you can be placed with anyone of a similar mmr.\n\n-----------\n\nNow,  on to the 2nd part.  I don't know if there is an official name for it but I usually hear it referred to as the mmr pendulum.\n\nFor up to 20ish games you will, on average, be placed with people of higher elo/mmr, vs players of lower elo/mmr.  After a while, the number of games of which varies on how well you do.\n\nAfter some number of games you will start to be placed on average with teammates who are lower elo/mmr than you and your enemies.  \n\nThis helps balance out queues and makes it easier for the game to match people together.","replies":[{"poster":"Exta5y","date":"2016-05-25T19:22:13.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-05-25T19:23:19.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Np :P","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SrbLud","date":"2016-05-25T18:14:12.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your mmr is still high so you get matched with them.

Whey not just put me where I should have been. Its clear that the system believes that I deserve to play against gold players, so why put me in silver","replies":[{"poster":"SrbLud","date":"2016-05-25T19:02:59.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cause of your placement matches.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-05-25T18:10:34.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You usually get placed at least 1 teir below where you ended last season assuming you did good in provisionals. You did not to well so you say so hence why you dropped to silver 2 instead of silver 1.  \n\nHowever thats just your lp.  Your mmr is still high gold/low plat hence why you are getting matched with golds and plats and when you win you get like 27 lp.  It knows you aren't silver so its making it easier to climb until you start losing more games.","replies":[{"poster":"Exta5y","date":"2016-05-25T18:37:57.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sigh, playing LoL rank is like playing russian roulette, you never know when you are going to get F&^K, but you know it will eventually happen","replies":[]}]}]}
