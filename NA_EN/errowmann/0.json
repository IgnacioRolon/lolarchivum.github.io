{"poster":"errowmann","date":"2015-04-16T08:12:51.940+0000","title":"Alistar rework","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"I think that alistars kit is very poor right now (as a lot of old champs), so I do my little rework for him, expect you like it.\n\nPassive (TRAMPLE): As it is, but now it scales with health.\nQ (PULVERIZE): As it is.\nW (SEETHE): Alistar channels (seethe with anger) for 0.5 seconds (like gragas), his next basic attack smash with both hands his enemy splashing to near enemys (like hydra), doubling his ad to the enemy he attacks. CD: 8 sec are something like that. Interesting to combo with shen.\nE (ENRAGE): Every time any source deals damage to alistar he gains 1 stack. At 10 stacks he becomes enraged and knocks back (0.5 sec) all the enemys in an area and deal some damage. I think this ability would be a lot of fun cause you cant control it, so you can go in the enemy team and knockback all the enemys or help the enemy assasin reach your adc XD.  As a secondary passive, you gain (2%/4%/6%/8%/10%) of your total health as armor and mr. Just passing ults tankiness to his E.\nR(STAMPEDE!!!): Alistar channels for 1 second (like bulls do) and charge forward knocking up all enemys in his path (two parts, first you press r to channel, and then press r to the location you want to charge), you can reactivate as sion does. Its like a short sions ult, the range is half and he doesnt stop when he collides with an enemy but he follows his charge.\n\nSo, i think this kit would be a lot of fun. More interactive for both teams with ult and e.\nJungle alistar: His 3 basic abilities are aoe + your passive.  His clear times would be high but now he is very bad ganker till level 6 cause you dont have gapclosers. So his early game work should be reach 6 as soon as possible and invade enemys jungle with your powerfull kit (w can destroy enemy jungler early game, nobody can 1 vs 1 you, but you are very very pokeable). when you reach 6 you will be the tower diver monster alistar has always been with his ult.\nSupport alistar: He doesnt has his headbutt now to go in or peel enemys, but his damage is very high so if they go in you will smash their faces. Its good for you to take minions aggro so you can enrage more often when fighting.\nLate game: He would be an enormous, unkillable monster with high damage. He&iexcl;&iexcl;WANTs!! to take all the damage you can in tf to enrage more often, enemies will be scared when they see alistar in the frontline, ready to peel or/and init with STAMPEDE!! or/and righteous glory.\n\nPROS:\n- Very high aoe damage.\n- Unkillable monster.\n- Very good 1 vs 1.\n- Good clear speed and invades in jungle.\n- The ult can change matches.\n- King of knockups/knockbacks.\nCONS:\n- Pokeable as hell.\n- Very bad ganker before 6.\n- Enrage can safe enemy champions or kill yours.\n- No gap closhers.\n\nPD: Sorry for my ingrish XD.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-16T09:39:36.576+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest that kit turn him into a very different champ,  the Passive and Q need to change the scaling AP into HP. The W turned into a skill shot can be nice but have some cons, his E does't have thematic sense, he need somethung new, in his R the bonus AD its usseles he need something like bonus HP (like Nasus ult) and turn more Bigger.","replies":[{"poster":"errowmann","date":"2015-04-16T09:47:37.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Q has enough flat damage and cc, giving scaling health would be to much for me. Im agree with you in the passive. For me alistar is a furious bull, if you enrage him he will turn mad and destroy you, and thats what ive tried to show in this kit, with enrage and seethe abilities and this funny ult.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-16T10:18:11.315+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got it.\n\nCompared with the real Alistar.\n\nI prefer the Pulverize scaling with HP. (I don't know why riot don't make this change on live)\n\nthe same to the Q, I like as it, but he is not a mage bulll, so have more sense the Bonus HP scaling than AP.\n\nI never never change his actual W, its so iconic on him. but too the AP scaling and change with bonus HP\n\nThe E, the actual E does't fit into a Minotaaur, your E its so funny, but the part that \"You can't control it\" is the main problem, I like the idea of recharge skill (like Kassadin E or Mao Passive) so each time that Alistar as hurt he gain a stack) at 6 stack you can activate this skill to  knocks back (0.5 sec) all the enemys in an area and deal some damage.\n\nThe R I prefer the actual but with some tweaks, change the active AD bonus into Hp and make Alistar more bigger to help him to peel and block some damage for his carry.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ZACKandATTACK","date":"2015-04-16T12:00:59.792+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that Alistar's problem is with his passive, not with the rest of his abilities.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NoMonku","date":"2015-04-16T09:57:28.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You just seemed to keep what you liked about {{champion:12}} then removed/changed what you didn't like about his kit.  You just made him a mix of the fun parts of Alistar/Sion which makes him incredibly hard to balance.  Also giving him % hp scaling is a problem because then he will actually hurt, which isn't his intended role.  Yes, he can do damage if you build it on him, ANY champion can, but he is inferior at it compared to others because of his intended role.  he is supposed to be the bodyguard who protects his team.  With your changes you just made him another Sion, which removes any uniqueness he really had, making this \"rework\" pointless.\n\nHe is fine the way he is and doesn't need a change to his kit imo.","replies":[{"poster":"errowmann","date":"2015-04-16T10:06:10.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only thing i \"take\" is the ult of sion, for me is a change of his current headbutt converted into an ult. I just put that is something like sions so readers can understand it. i didnt give him % hp scaling but hp scaling and only in the passive.\nHe is a fucking bull, he has to hurt, to counter this is his mobility, in this kit now he has not headbutt, so you can poke him hard. I think this kit would be unique and very funny.","replies":[{"poster":"NoMonku","date":"2015-04-16T10:25:05.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The real issue here is WHY does he need the change?  He is fine the way he is.  Since you want him to be a damage dealer, it is better to just make another bull champion instead if you really want one.  Why does he need his kit changed?","replies":[{"poster":"errowmann","date":"2015-04-16T10:52:12.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cause his kit is just w q combo and wait for cd. E is useless mid and late game and r only UF u are getting the damage. You have to wait 10 sec todo do something again. Just my opinion.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
