All of the most braindead champions are the best to carry with. Perhaps it is just this patch, but all of the champions with the same combos, gap close and auto attack, are winning the games left and right. Why are all of these champions allowed to get a few kills and able to carry a game? And why are all of these champions just copies of themselves? What do Xin Zhao, Master Yi, Udyr, and Tryndamere have in common? Gap close, auto attack. Each one of them has a the ability to get to their enemy quickly and auto attack to death. Where is the skill? I can see Riot having these champions for new players, but why are they the best? Why can a Master Yi with a 2 kill advantage carry the team by simply auto attacking for 1/5 of your health? I, and a lot of other players are getting really tired of these copy and pasted skill less champions that a ruining the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Ratmond IRL","date":"2018-06-05T11:42:07.983+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definitely agree!! With this new Master Yi + Taric mid strat this \"Gap Close, Auto Attack Champions\" post is really hitting home to me. As we see more LPL Boosters using the Master Yi + Taric strat to elo boost it really is coming into light that \"braindead\" champions are the easiest to play and carry. I really hope Riot looks into this and fires their shit ass balancing team that are filled with hardstuck silvers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HinchBlondie","date":"2018-06-05T11:53:58.589+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly, this is a problem that needs to be addressed. Too many times I have seen Udyr Jungle being picked in Plat due to the fact that it is \"easy\" or \"brain-dead\" to play. Playing high-skill junglers such as Nidalee or Kindred is rewarded no more, as they are often seen as \"off-meta\". Riot needs to fix their game ASAP because frankly, there are no more genuinely high-skill cap champs being played across the board anymore. (It got better for top lane, but I don't think the same will be for jungle).","replies":[]},{"poster":"wildfox99","date":"2018-06-05T13:59:41.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Why can a Master Yi with a 2 kill advantage carry the team by simply auto attacking for **1/5** of your health?\n\nbecause he didn't close his {{item:3124}} yet","replies":[]},{"poster":"G FUEL Guzzler","date":"2018-06-05T07:34:20.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You right! It do be like that! I hate it!!!!! Those silly Riot employees!!! I'm glad you were able to notice this trend! It is getting very annoying getting right-clicked to death by brain dead, no skill champions!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-06-05T03:09:59.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">  What do Xin Zhao, Master Yi, Udyr, and Tryndamere have in common?\n\nOutdated kits from what is effectively a different game. Everyone knows they are feast-or-famine champs that are far too annoying for how objectively crap they are.\n\nThey are going to get reworks eventually. Xin will probably get something beyond the bandaid rework he got last year, as well.","replies":[]}]}
