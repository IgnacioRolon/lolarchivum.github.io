Althought, after looking at the news pages and other sites, it shows that the **Time Portal Icon** would also be given along with the Ezreal skin, and having not received it, I was wondering if I could ask about the issue.\r\n\r\nI could be mistaken, and that the Time Portal icon is given to those who have owned the Pulsefire Ezreal skin pre-update, which I can understand. It could also be just that I have _yet_ to receive the icon as of May 29th.\r\n\r\nClarification would be great, thanks for reading !\r\n {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-27T01:36:02.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're correct!
