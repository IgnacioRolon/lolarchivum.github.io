The combined removal of sota, blue buff's 15% ap steroid, and the nerf to rylias hit her pretty hard. I'm not saying she deserves anything drastic, and I don't think a \"sizeable\" buff, as Meddler put it, is what she needs. But rarely is she worth the pick over other junglers at the moment, and I feel like we would be nerfing the entire jungle roster before she became a solid competitive pick again. If Master Yi and Gragas are getting very minor jungle buffs, I don't see why she doesn't deserve them.","replies":[{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2017-01-17T08:01:01.467+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"She's the worst jungler because the jungle right now is centralized around a super small pool which dominate the rest. \n\nNidalee would rise in usage and have an easier time \"being nidalee\" if her most common matchups weren't also her absolute worse ones. \n\nWhat can nidalee really do to {{champion:154}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:120}} even if she had 100 base AP? \n\nThen the moment they all get nerfed, what are other junglers suspose to do about a now buffed nidalee? \n\nThe jungle isn't stable, and high elo nidalee mains realize that nidalee is a super flexible champion who seems to do her job well in any condition when played right, but right now there is barely any \"right play\" nidalee can make vs. bruiser junglers, divers, and harder to kill camps which she loved to steal no matter what riot puts her in the patch notes for the 50th time for. \n\nThe moment nidalee sees a lee or vi, she might as well just stand still, show mastery, and let them have it, and that's the case for a lot of other junglers right now. \n{{champion:11}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:203}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:245}}{{champion:32}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:104}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Teemo Arrrrrrrgh","date":"2017-01-17T16:06:08.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nidalee Destroys those champions are you kidding? -Not Lee tho","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2017-01-17T06:26:03.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yet high MMR people still like playing her. \n\nShe deserves a 50-100 or so HP buff for nerfing both her jungle pattern and effective HP via SotA/Rylai's. \n\n_________\n\nKinda the same with with Vlad. When he functions, he functions very well (for the people that actually know what to do with him and how to build [AP]), but he still needs minior base stat buffs to allow him to function a little more reliably in this meta after all of the changes that affected him.\n\n____________\n\nYi needed some help because he can't afk farm anymore. He was getting buffs for the same reason as Nid. Hers are probably coming soon. \n\nGragas is one of the junglers Riot wants as a staple pick in competitive, along with Lee, apparently.

First of all its not a joke that she is placed at a 40 % win rate. Her cd's on Q and W are way too long you honestly can't do anything if the suddenly shields or heals your spear --> Q-Cougar form combo, you look like a total idiot because your spells are never ready when you need them. And the problems with Nidalee is not Vi, Heca, Zac its the previous nerf that made her crazy clumsy. Buff NIDALEE don't listen to his Nonsense. Atleast Bring back the CD on Q and W again","replies":[{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2017-01-17T17:34:15.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what you're saying is:\n\n-I'm an arrogant person who just proved the op's point by saying bruisers and tanks are too strong with their shields right now and nidalee can't win the 1v1 because they have too much bulk and CC. CDs are not the issue when Vi can just Q-> E-> R-> auto -> E and you die without any form of reaction. CDs are not the issue when zac and hecarim gank as much as elise and still outscale destroying you. CDs are not the issue when lee sin is just being lee sin. \n\nSorry but you calling me out when I'm just repeating what the 3rd best nid main in the world says doesn't make you any more creditable than me, why don't you call him an idiot yourself instead, it might boost your ego and your elo. \n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/gXJWqhrM-rank-3-nidalee-world-asks-riot-to-not-buff-nidalee-on-patch-72?sort_type=best\n\nAlso funnily enough, she has a 49.39% winrate vs. lee sin, but a 39.2% winrate vs. vi. Out of all those champs lee is the easiest.\n\nNids is a high mechanical champion, so 45% winrate is nothing new for her, comparing her average 45% winrate while she was **broken**, only 4% lower than her usual (currently 41%) doesn't seem like a horrible number, atleast not an \"unplayable\" status like everybody is exaggerating, the slightest meta change would put her back in her norm status.
