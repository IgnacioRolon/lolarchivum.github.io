You also have to play those fun/average games that you tend to forget about after because negative experiences stand out more in your memory.  Then, if you have enough average games with a >50% win-rate overall, you climb.\n\nAbout the specific game of which you speak, there is little that you have mentioned that you could have improved on.  If you're team won't listen, you can't do anything about that.  Still, I'm sure you made your own mistakes that game as well.  Just focus on improving those.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azure Hamster","date":"2016-10-18T16:05:35.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play better on average than other people with your MMR.
