I can't point out what it is. When in game the league client and game client equal to an added 1500mb of memory (Im not sure if this is normal). Dragging my mouse over the minimap causes the rectangle to chase my cursor instead of follow it directly (not sure if this is normal either). Game play feels like 150-250 ping and this continues throughout the entirety of the game. \n\nIssue has only appeared recently and seems to be correlated with yesterdays large windows update.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-06T15:25:06.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to help you out here; though, I'm really not sure what you mean by the rectangle chasing the cursor.  If you have a screenshot, that could help me figure out what you mean!
