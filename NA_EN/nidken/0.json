Bugged?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really need to analyze a game I just played. I already have a bug where my client crashes after the victory screen. My match history in game and on the online server seems to be delayed/lagged by about a day. The last view-able match occurred 24 hours ago. Can I have confirmation that these games will be revived for view later on? I would genuinely be really upset if this information is lost. ;n;","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-03T16:46:53.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The external match history site may need to sync and update more recent matches.     The in-client match history should also provide a similairly descriptive overview of the match.  Regarding your client crashing, I would like to be able to help with that.  Are you receiving any errors, like a bug splat?  Anymore information on this can help a lot!","replies":[{"poster":"Nidken","date":"2016-08-04T14:13:08.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do not receive any error messages, no bug splat. Every about 4 in 10 games my client will crash as soon as I click the \"defeat\" or \"victory\" screen and it will not go to the end game lobby. Interestingly, this crash also occasionally occurs when leaving custom games. When trying to open the LoL client for the next 5-10 minutes after the crash nothing will happen. For a long time I had to wait this 5-10 minutes for the client to work. Then I discovered that opening task manager and scrolling down to the 'background processes' area has the 'lolClient' thing still running. When I end this task I am able to open the client normally and log in again.\n\nThat is all the information I have at the moment.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-04T15:06:50.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the detailed information!  Based on what you're telling me, it doesn't necessarily sound like a crash but instead a connection issue.  It seems to me that the client is having trouble establishing a connection after the match is over, and ends up in some dormant state.  To help rule this out, I recommend going through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide as a first step.  This will help strengthen your network so your connection to our servers remains steady.  Let me know how this works out for you!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
