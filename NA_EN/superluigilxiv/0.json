And you're right the last one I ran was the Shurima one - about 2 years ago (how time flies!)\n\n{{sticker:cass-cry}} \n\nTwo things though - I ran those when I would wake up and the whim would take me.  They were never official in any capacity - and indeed, most of the other folks at Riot never even knew I was doing it :)  Just like, one day you might wake up and think to yourself \"I fancy going to the beach today!\" I'd wake up and think \"I feel like torturing poor creative writers with an overly harsh word limit!\" or something like that.\n\nSecond thing - do you know there's an official writing competition running right now, for Riot, over at Polycount?  You've got until the Jan 31st deadline - so much longer than I'd have given ;D\n\nhttp://polycount.com/discussion/192491/announcing-the-riot-creative-contest-2017/p1\n\nThere's a bunch of WIP threads for the Narrative category already - I was looking forward to reading a few over the break.  I'm not connected to the judging, so I don't feel it's a conflict of interest, and some other Rioters have already said they've found some real good ones in there.\n\nDo you think that might scratch that itch for a while?  At least until lightning strikes again, and I wake up inspired to run another, totally unofficial, compo.","replies":[{"poster":"Blood Magicks","date":"2017-12-22T20:52:29.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there any chance the deadline can be extended until after Noxus lores are out?

Think of it this way - there's always going to be new information around the corner, and you won't be marked down for not psychically knowing the future!  Every writer is doing the best with what they have, after all.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Furor Nexis","date":"2017-12-22T23:22:32.947+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bioluminescence,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=xAc0jAOx,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-12-22T18:47:28.350+0000)\n>\n\n> \n> There&#x27;s a bunch of WIP threads for the Narrative category already - I was looking forward to reading a few over the break.

I've had to change my Varus piece maybe 3 times now on my narrative entry. The new lore sure made my older story a doozy since it didn't fit into the lore anymore. {{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-12-22T18:50:23.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, that’s for Riot?\n\nOh the pressure.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2017-12-22T18:54:42.338+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ralanr,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=xAc0jAOx,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-12-22T18:50:23.706+0000)\n>\n> Wait, that’s for Riot?\n> \n> Oh the pressure.\n\nWell:\n\n> Winners will be announced and posted on Polycount, RealTime VFX, and on a Riot Art Site TBA\n\nand\n\n> Riot Games is the sole judge of the contest and the judgment will be final\n\nSoooooo, good luck! \n{{sticker:galio-happy}}","replies":[{"poster":"Bjartan","date":"2017-12-22T23:49:22.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the Narrative part, can we talk about a champion but with the perspective of a character of our imagination ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-12-22T18:56:28.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh god. \n\nWriters block don’t kill me now.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2017-12-22T23:36:30.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be an honor to have Bio read mine and tear it apart.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SuperLuigiLXIV","date":"2017-12-22T19:50:55.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had no idea about this contest. o_o\n\nThank you for the link!
