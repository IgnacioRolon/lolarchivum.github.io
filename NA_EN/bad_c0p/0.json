That's awesome what a great feature. Considering you're a multi million dollar company don't you think you could find a way to make your client not crash or create a better system where I dont lose my series because YOUR client kicks me out of the game? Thank you very fucking much.","replies":[{"poster":"Belencia","date":"2017-03-11T22:33:31.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While the new client is fancy, overall it seems more buggy and laggy. Today it randomly crashed while still managing to accept the match and making me wait the 5 minutes for que dodging. I would like the option of keeping the old client merely for its stability.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-11T17:50:01.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sucks to hear that your client is crashing, and I'd like to help if I could get some more info.  What do you mean exactly by crashing- are there any error messages?  Are you on the test client or legacy version, and are you running any third party applications that interact with League?  It's clear whatever happened was really frustrating, and I want to make sure it doesn't happen to you again.  Let me know so I can help!","replies":[{"poster":"Scyora","date":"2017-03-11T19:18:24.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nI am not the OP but if I can help with my VERY frustrating experience, I have the new client and the following happen almost regularly:\n\n-After accepting the afk check, the circle turns grey for about 10sec, then returns me to matchmaking and say I failed to accept the check.\n\n-Game shuts down completely, on some occasions taking my entire computer with me, during game load. It prompts a blue screen and the message \"Your computer has faced a problem and needs to restart\" along with a frowny face.\n\n\nWorst part is I lose my ranked AND I get leaver buster'd.\n\nI hope something can be done at some point.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-11T19:32:32.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn, it sounds like you've got a lot going on and I can certainly understand the frustration there.  When you hit accept, your network is transitioning you from the client and into champion select.  An unstable connection can cause you to fail that transfer and get left behind.  Your best bet would be to use the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to fix that up.\n\nThe other issue here may be a bit more severe, and I'd wager requires some more attention than the other issue.  What you're reporting sounds like some form of driver or hardware failure, or maybe even overheating.  This shutting is usually a safety precaution to save your PC.  In this case, I'd suggest clearing out your vents then hitting us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).\n\nGrab our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and attach it to your ticket, to give us context.
