I waited for 10 minutes and it was still at 0%. I tried restarting LoL and stayed at 0%. I don't want to get any penalties for a error from my computer or LoL. Much help appreciated!\n\nEDIT: Waiting until it loses connection works as it restarts the client.\nEDIT 2: I just got lucky because it doesn't work still after I just finished the bot game.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-14T02:52:48.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're loading percentage was stuck at 0% for over 10 minutes, there's a good chance that your network is having a hard time getting connected to the game server you're trying to play on. \n\nLet's be sure to hit all of our bases by doing the steps in our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).
