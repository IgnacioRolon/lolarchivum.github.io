If your friend wanted to play TFT, or League in general, they'd have made their own account. You can file a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if you want to try and appeal it, but like I said, account sharing is against the rules, so I can't imagine you'd get the punishment overturned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2019-11-26T03:23:34.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn dude... youre double fucked.
