Kai'Sa genuinely sounds like the most well-rounded human being in League even if her personality isn't particularly adventurous.\r\n\r\nI can really personally relate to the feeling of taking a deep breath after going through something incredibly harsh.

She spent half her life trapped in a hostile territory fighting for her survival and it isn't visible, she has a very close relationship with the void world to the point of being physically and mentally transformed in a way, and it isn't visible either.

But that's what so brilliant about her character when you actually think about it - spending years in the void, surviving for years alone to come back as...normal? No tentacles growing out of your face? No mental battle with some creature to see who takes over?? The fact that she's (relatively) normal is a miracle and a testament to how strong, capable, and even fortunate she is while just being a normal human being. This is Lara Croft levels of survival that people aren't seeing. She's probably going to be the most relatable champion in this game by far, and there's no champion that exists like her.

They have a normal job, act like a normal person and do normal person stuff.  Nothing a-typical about 'em.\n\nThen one day you find a weird-looking suit in their closet when you're putting away your coat, and they tell you nonchalantly that they're actually an alien freedom fighter from beyond the Milky Way and they came here to assassinate other alien's in human form who secretly rule our world.  Insert a \njoke about your most loathed political figure here.\n\nWould that be shocking?  Jarring?  Yeah, very.  But if said person STILL did nothing but ate nachos, went to work at Target and hung out... and you never saw anything else weird about them ever again... it would seem less like that backstory was real or part of who they were... and more like they made up a big steaming pile of bullshit to mess with you when you found an old cosplay suit in their closet.  \n\nNot the best analogy, I'll admit... but you get the point.  If they had just played up what she's about a LITTLE more, it would seem real.  It would feel right.  If it's supposed to be jarring how normal she is after what happened, play that up.  Make it more obvious.  Put a little more effort into showing that this is the case... because this is only one of MANY equally viable suggestions for what she's like and what kinda mood that's supposed to convey about her that fits mostly because of how weakly Riot defined her.  Is she normal seeming intentionally, like she's struggling hard to put her ordeal behind her and remember/embrace the normal world?   Is she normal because she's so freakin' oblivious to her trauma that it may as well have NOT affected her cause she forgot most of it?  Is she normal because the void wasn't actually traumatic at all?  Is it because her skin suit made her see all that hunting and worrying for her life as just as normal as eating at the park so she's coping really well?  Is her mindset alien?  Entirely human?  Someplace in between?  Is she trying to deal, or is she dealing just fine?  \n\nNone of this comes across in how they presented her... but they presented her so poorly defined that you could probably EASILY make a case and see ANY of those interpretations of her as being the ones Riot was going for.  THAT is my issue with her... It feels like Riot could have done a LITTLE more work and made her character come across better, but they chose not to.  Either out of laziness or intentional desire to make her have broader appeal and to leave her character vague so she can be whatever they want her to be once they finally get around to the void update.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2018-02-23T03:03:26.617+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"Dude, no one is saying she has to be a disheveled wreck.  Most people are just saying that she comes across as very boring and lackluster.  There is so little emotion or intensity to her.  If her thing is \"I finally made it back, thank god!\"  Then that's fine... sell it.  Sell the shit out of it.  Have lines about how she missed grass or wind or trees.  Have her sound determined not to let the void spawn ruin this world like they did their own.  \n\nGive her some freaking intensity and emotion.  I've heard people say she's supposed to be emotionally muted because she had to kill off her emotions to survive... or that the symbiote deadened them.  If so, they undersold that too.  She doesn't seem unemotional... she just seems bland.  And if her thing is supposed to be relief on being out of the hellscape (even if she's handled it well and isn't crazy... that's perfectly fine) then sell that.  She doesn't have any lines that drive home either of those interpretations of her.  She just has some basic \"back, monster\" stuff and some where she bluntly states how she feels or what her purpose is... but in a way that doesn't really sound like she's packing much drive.  She's make a terrible inspirational speaker.\n\nShe DOES have a line about \"I know I'm frightening, but I'm here to help.\".  And this makes me feel that her hotgirlness was a decision not always intended for her.  She does NOT look frightening at all... she looks like a hot girl in a tight catsuit with some goofy wings.  Was she supposed to be more alien or monstrous and that was changed along the way?  I doubt riot would tell us if that was the case.\n\nI think the problem people have with her is the problem of underselling.  Her background is BIG.  It implied huge, life-changing crap happened to her.  Her ordeal seems like it should have been a powerful thing that influenced everything about her... and that doesn't come across in her design or her VO.  Whether she's traumatized, devolved into a monster, emotionally dead, filled with intense willpower and survival instinct or just quietly joyous to be alive none of it conveys well with the performance we got from her.  I'm sure her lore story will make some excuses and explain why she is how she is, but it won't make her feel any more interesting, I fear.  \n\nRiot has done well with this in the past.  They sold the hell out of Sion's berzerker status with occasional lines that he realizes he's become something horrible and he can't escape it.  Poppy is a plucky, humble hero and that comes across well.  Warwick is a monster trying to remember his humanity through a haze of bloodlust.  Swain is a stoic \"ends justify the means\" sort that will sacrifice anything he needs to if it will further his goals... which he sees as commendable.  Riot is usually pretty decent at this.  \n\nBut Kai doesn't have that kind of performance or passion in her.  She doesn't really feel like a character... more like a shadow of one.  She doesn't even feel like a character that they meant to to be a shadow of herself after her ordeal.  She just seems like she's got no soul to her.","replies":[{"poster":"Hullo","date":"2018-02-23T15:39:43.560+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2018-02-24T22:16:15.798+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I listened to her VO dude. the ONLY one of those I'd say she puts any emotion behind is the one about the honeyfruit... so much so that it sounds jarring compared to how deadpan and inflectionless she is with all her other lines.

It feels REALLY off and wrong for her to be the only character that seems to be acting \"normally\" in a setting full of larger than life characters, giant monsters, hammy warriors screaming about their countries and so on.  It makes her the \"boring\" one, despite having one of the most intense backstories of anyone here.  And ironically, if they'd wanted to play that up... it would have made her a better character TOO!  If she'd been all \"yeah, the void was a terrible hellscape... but I'm not gonna let it get me down!\" it would have been kinda charming in a way.  Leaning a bit towards the ball of cheer that is Lux, but eh... it's endearing.\n\nBut they didn't commit to that... or to anything.  She seems like a character half-formed.  Given no real soul or emotion for us to either relate to her or find her interesting.  Oh, her background is interesting enough that people still will, filling in the blanks that the Riot team developing left half-formed or bare.... but that's doesn't make her a good or fully-realized character.  I can attribute pages upon pages of lore, emotion and backstory to even the most poorly developed character in a work.  Just look at the piles of fan work making Boba Fett a real character rather than a throw-away goon in a weird suit to see this in action.  Fan's latch onto things and pour tons of creativity and love into things they like to make them deeper and more interesting than they ever were in their original works.  And there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nBut it doesn't mean Riot couldn't have done a LOT more to give her some more heart and soul when they made her.  I'm actually wondering if they purposely made her so bland knowing people would fangasm all over her but that people would riot if they took such a long-awaited character and did her \"wrong\".  So we got a milquetoast cardboard cutout of a character that you can imagine anything you like about.  She's secretly a tortured soul.  She's unbroken and super-strong willed.  She's barely holding it together.  She's emotionally stunted by her suit or by her ordeal.  She's so easy to project all these things onto because they didn't really DEFINE anything about her.... and that is why she's so disappointing to me.\n\nBut I guess to a lot of people, that's EXACTLY what they wanted.","replies":[{"poster":"Hullo","date":"2018-02-24T23:00:21.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2018-02-25T00:23:24.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"See...

It would not have taken much to make who she is come across more clearly and I feel they failed at that.  That's all.  \n\nAlso, personally... yeah.  I feel an ordeal like she went through should have a really big effect on her personality, whether she was shattered by it, overcame it and was stronger for it, or is just lost and confused because of her alien life and no longer relates to the real world well.  They're all fine ways to take it, but in media you gotta show, not tell.  A little more emotion in her voice and a few more lines conveying what she's feeling (or NOT feeling, emotionally dead \"alien in human form\" kai would be interesting too) is all it would have taken.  You can't undersell a character like that who has been through so much of an ordeal and not expect people to feel she seems... bland.  \n\nImagine the most horrific thing that you can imagine has happened to you.  Now imagine how you'd deal with it.  Now realize that quietly living a day at a time isn't really the kind of thing that excites audiences and imagine how you would want a character in a movie or a show to handle it.  Not really the same thing, is it?  Let alone in so over-the-top and magical a setting as Runeterra.  Just a LITTLE more to show who she is and convey what she's like... that's all I wanted.  \n\nYeah, the Kassadin thing is a good point.  I didn't bring it up because that feeling of \"this should be a bigger deal, they should have written this different... this feels like they didn't put enough into it\" that I get from her interactions with her dad are what I get from her in EVERYTHING.  The only line of hers that seems to have ANY emotion put into it is the one about fruit.  I believe she likes fruit.  That... isn't much of a character.  It could have been if they'd put that delight into more lines and showed more to make it seem like she's overjoyed in all the simple things because she lived in such an alien world for so long.  But they don't... they just have her like fruit.  It's jarring.  She has lines about wind and trees and how she missed them, but not the same joy she has for fruit.  Why not?  Have her dreamily talk about being able to feel wind again before clearing her throat, putting on her serious face and going into even-toned \"hunter-mode\".  that would be great!\n\nJust... little details that make it all come together.

A lot of people seem to be doing that, in fact.\n\nI think she was intentionally designed to have generic appeal, take no risks and rustle no one's jimmies... which unfortunately leaves her very bland, underwhelming and underdeveloped.  Forgive me for the idea that you liked your interpretation of her, when it's just your opinion of what Riot was going for or what you get from her when you see her.  But off-base though it was to assume you liked the direction you felt they took her... can you honestly say you're CERTAIN that's how she really is because the VO really defines her well... or is it just your best guess based on the presentation they gave of her?\n\nIf when they reveal her lore story it says she is actually a dangerously unstable mutant pretending to be a human woman (unlikely, I know) or secretly someone who misses the void because it's all she knows, but is rational enough to know that she can't let the world become consumed by it or something... will you be shocked because it's contrary to how they developed her... or because she was so weakly developed that you just kinda.... guessed wrong?  (Though to be fair, I think your interpretation IS the one Riot is gonna go by... I just think it's really boring and weaksauce.)\n\nI feel like she's a bland, shapeless blob without well-defined character traits so that she can easily slot into whatever role they eventually want to give her when they finally develop the void lore update... AND because she is along-awaited character and they were afraid of the fan rage they'd get for doing  her \"wrong\".  This is all to her detriment as a character tho... she's less an interesting, well-defined character that I can get behind, relate to and get invested in and more... the cardboard cutout of one...  That was left in a storeroom for a bit too long so it's kinda damp and smells weird.","replies":[{"poster":"Hullo","date":"2018-02-25T17:42:36.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2018-02-26T18:04:20.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hullo,realm=OCE,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=PYjJcTJP,comment-id=00050001000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-02-25T17:42:36.501+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m curious what you think about Yasuo? \n\nHe's not bland.  He's a wandering hobo with a drinking problem.  His character might be a little cliche, but that's ok.  He's the archetypal \"tragic anime loner\" sort.  Cocky, skilled and with some tragic past (killing his borther) that gives him reason to be a little edgy and melancholy.  I much prefer the normal \"Life sucks so get drunk\" Yasuo over all of his edgelord skins that play up the wangst so much you'd expect he should take extra damage every so often during game from cutting himself.\n\nBut Yasuo isn't a bad CHARACTER.  He's defined enough as a person to function, his motivations are defined at least a little.  I mean, one of his character traits is that he's kinda drifting without direction, but they make that obvious... so it's fine.  The wind samurai thing is neat as a character set too, and his powers (while making him infuriating to PLAY against) all fit that idea pretty well.  As a character in a story, movie or show he'd be fine... they'd likely develop him a lot more there, but for a game where characterization is only done through a few voice lines and the way the character looks, he's fine.  I mean, I HATE how he is mechanically designed (his numbers and kit) but his character is fine.  Good, even.  A lot of people like him for a reason.\n\n> \n> I&#x27;d say Ahri is another character players read what they want into, but I wouldn&#x27;t say she&#x27;s a self-insert (maybe an idealised fantasy girlfriend?) I don&#x27;t play her often but some of the responses of Ahri mains to Star Guardian Ahri (people thinking she was too mean, or wanting her to be more friendly, or calling her stuck up) made me realise she&#x27;s another champion where every player seems to have their own concept of who she is (sometimes even at odds with her seductress concept), yet I wouldn&#x27;t really define her mains as self-inserting.\n\nAhri is a cute girl with a cute laugh and fluffy tails.  I think her main appeal is in being attractive and appealing, not her character... because they have changed her lore DRASTICALLY and it made no real effect.  For example, is Ahri a flirty, playful seductress that eats your soul and says something like \"Mmmm, yum.\" then gives a girlish laugh and flits off to find more food, or is she a tragic creature, driven to devour souls and regretting how horrible it is?  Well, her lore paints BOTH pictures and neither really comes across with her VO.  She WAS a giggling devourer of souls not that unlike Evelyn (but more innocent, if that makes sense) who didn't really realize eating souls was kinda messed up.  Then she DID realize it, but she still needs to eat souls... so she's more tragic now.   Her VO comes closer to the \"nom nom souls, tee hee\" version of her, but doesn't imply that innocence and not realizing what she's doing.  In fact, it flat out acts like she's FULLY aware she's gonna kill you, she just knows you're going to enjoy yourself as you go.  It sure as hell doesn't play up the tragedy of a character driven to kill people (or worse, debatably) but who has realized how awful that is.  There's no guilt or tragedy in how they portray her at ALL.  At least, in-game.\n\nAnd skins aren't canon.  SG Ahri is just a spoof of a magical girl archetype, and since Ahri is league's most token hot chick, they made her the SG's token hot chick.  The haughty one that wouldn't talk to you in high school.  The cliche cheerleader who won't give you the time of day even as you lust over her.  People don't like that as much because... well... that person isn't TRYING to appeal to you like basic Ahri is.  She's distainful of you.  And when basic Ahri was essentially a busty coffee shop girl playing up how much she's into you for tips, it gets some people a little salty that SG Ahri now doesn't seem to give a shit about them.  She's off-duty now sucker, and she never liked you!  \n\nBut yeah, she's a bit flat but a VERY good example of what I mean when I say Kai's lore won't save her from being bland.  No matter how angsty they made Ahri's lore... she's peppy and flirty and unashamed of it in-game.  No matter how much Kai's lore gives her character OUT of game, in game she'll still be that hot coffee shop girl's bored co-worker... just kinda going through the motions half-heartedly until it's quitting time.  She's not going to become more exciting in-game or have more emotion in her performance.  She'll still be bland like lukewarm water.\n\n> \n> Also do you think self-insert or idealised characters are inherently bad for League? \n\nSelf-insert characters are FINE, but Riot did the wrong thing with her.  You want self-insert characters?  Great.  There are 150+ characters in this game... make 150+ different but well-defined characters and let people pick the ones they identify the most with.  They should aim each character in a different place.  That's called variety.  Then, on the days you're feeling Chill, you can be Zac.  On the days you're in a bad mood and you wanna cut a bitch... you can be Zed or Darius.  On the days when you don't give a shit, you can be Rammus.  \n\nUrgot and Ivern aren't bad EITHER.  Urgot is freakin' BANE, and you'd pick him when you want to be freakin' bane.  When you want to grind some punkass into mulch while telling him that is only happened because he wasn't as tough as you.  He's masochistic and brutal... and sometimes you're in that kinda mood... after a bad day at work or a pissing match with someone you know.  Or you're just a person that likes to work out some frustration about little things by ulting that enemy Caitlyn to death for the sixth time because she can't seem to avoid your R.  \n\nIvern's not bad either.  He is VERY well characterized.  He's a happy, upbeat nice guy that loves plants and animals.  He's a very \"chill\" character, almost an anti-Urgot.  If Urgot is the guy who has a chip on his shoulder, Ivern is the guy who tells him it's all gonna be okay.  You can relate to him plenty... he's a friendly, Bob Ross kinda guy that loves life and sometimes that is EXACTLY what you wanna play.  He makes you feel mellow the same way Urgot makes you feel powerful.  \n\nKai'sa makes you feel...?  \n> \n> *A long snipet about lore and how it is often contradictory or changes to be contradictory.\n\nMy issues with the lore are a WHOLE other can of worms I will not get into here.  This post is long enough.  Suffice to say I feel quite disappointed by most of the new lore and I'm salty about it.\n> \n> On your point about the blandness of Kai&#x27;sa I think I&#x27;m forgiving of Riot because of the backlash I saw Zoe recieve. Even before complaints about her in-game balance, these boards were flooded with threads about how her quirky and excitable behavior doesn&#x27;t fit League, or belongs more in a Disney movie, so for Riot to make a more stoic character immediately after the Zoe backlash makes sense to me. The backlash to Kai&#x27;sa confuses me because it doesn&#x27;t really seem like Riot can &quot;win&quot;, and that regardless of what they do they&#x27;ll get strong community backlash.\n\nWell... that's kinda different.  Those people didn't like Zoe because they did not like her character.  I am disappointed by Kai'sa because I do not feel she HAS a character.  At least, not a good one.  Zoe might not have been your cup of tea, but EVERYONE knew what she was.  What she was like and what she was about.  She was swimming in character.  Not NEW character... her quirky-girl archetype has been done plenty... but that also helped define her as a character so it worked FOR her and FOR understanding who she is.  \"Did you see Tangled?  Ok, but quirkier and she has magic space powers!\".  \n\nKai DOES fall into several tropes and archetypes... or seems to... but then fails to deliver on them.  People were expecting the angsty hunter or the broken warrior from her background.  People were expecting the archetype of her struggling to control alien impulses or fighting a battle against herself because of her alien suit.  But those ideas weren't used.  People who liked those ideas were sad, but some were glad to see her NOT go that route and seem to feel that simply lacking the obvious character-traits one would expect from her origins IS her character.  I... don't.  I see a character that could have had some cliche but entertaining character, but whom they devs said \"Nah, let's not do that!\"... and took those ideas out.  But they replaced them with nothing.  She's not angsty, or broken, or torn by alien impulses, or any of that tropey shit... and that's fine.  But she needs to be SOMETHING.  Even if that something is playing up the \"Yeah, it sucked... but I don't let it define who I am!\". Ironically, it'd help define who she is!  That's what I want... some definition of character.  I want her in-game lines to show who she is and why she is... and they fall short of that.  \n\nRight now, she is defined almost entirely by what she ISN'T.  She isn't broken.  She isn't inhuman.  She isn't that angsty.  She isn't alien and unable to relate to the real world.  She isn't very angry at the void.  She isn't desperate to find her father again.  Etc etc...   I want to see what she IS.  What IS she that makes her an entertaining character that I want to get behind?  To like?  I don't care if she's \"realistic\"... she's a magical superhuman wearing a bug that hunts more bugs.  If her thing is \"Yeah, I was in bug hell and wear an alien suit... no big\" then play THAT up.  Give her some freaking traits I can look at and laugh, or admire, or want to have myself.  She should make the audience feel SOMETHING.  \n\nAnd unless what she's meant to make them feel is \"slight arousal\"... because she does that ok I guess.  I mean, we've got WAY more sexualized champs in the game tho... and I doubt the \"girl next door\" one should be the one fresh outta bug hell... but I guess that could be fun in an absurd way.  Her blushing and asking you to carry her books while wearing her goofy bug suit.  Surreal. Not what I think Riot was going for tho.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nylisa","date":"2018-02-23T09:27:51.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe im missing the point here but :\n\n> She doesn't really feel like a character... more like a shadow of one.

Not necessarily 'crazy',  but she should have had a strong underlying theme to all her interactions that really pulls everything together.\n\nThe only real theme I get from her is 'We must stand together!' but it feels muddled at best.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2018-02-24T22:41:59.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that's what they were going for... but they really missed the landing.\n\nI don't mean fantasy \"hollow character\".  As in an emotionless husk of a person that may as well be an android or a machine.  We have that already and it's Orianna.  Ori was formerly LITERALLY a machine that had never been human, but her new lore makes her a character that has just been rendered REALLY emotionally dead by being turned into a machine.\n\nI mean \"hollow character\" in the writing sense.  They did not define her character well at all, so she feels empty of heart and soul.  Ori, ironically... does not.  She has a very well-defined character... which is ironically that of someone who may have no soul.  The point is, Ori may not have emotions but you do.  She makes you feel a certain way (her old lore was more tearjerker and better in this regard IMO, but meh) and she comes across as exactly what the writer wanted her to.  She's the machine pretending to be human, but unable to grasp what humanity really IS.  \n\nKai is... a girl.  She was in the void for a bit.  She got better.  It's hard to say how she feels about it.  Kinda ruffled but not really that broken up.  she got cool superpowers out of it.  She doesn't seem too stoked about them either.  Is she overjoyed to be home?  Is she too alien to feel that way anymore?  Is she utterly determined to fight the void, or is she doing it because she feels she's one of the only ones who can?  Does she hate it?  Does she hate voidspawn or just see them as monsters who need to be put down?  Does she miss her old life?  Has she given up that part of herself?  \n\nThey left her bland enough and hollow enough that you can EASILY answer all these questions in exactly the way you want and point out some reasons for why your opinion is correct... because Riot did not.  They left her VERY poorly developed and easy to project onto... which I feel is why a lot of people are calling her a good character and others are pointing out that she lacks character.  People are seeing in her what they want her to be because Riot did not put much in to narrow down the definition of what she is like.  Oh, there's a BASIC structure there.  She's obviously calm... a little upset at voidlings.... she likes fruit.  But she is just a basic skeleton of a character that the fans are building their own meat onto... making her into their own little version of what they wanted her to be and what they wanted her to be like.  Maybe because Kassadin's daughter was such a long-requested thing Riot felt they'd catch too much shit if they did it \"wrong\" and decided to take her a middle of the road cutout of a character that could have as much broad appeal as possible, with no sharp edges or intense traits that might make her upset some fan's ideas of what she'd be like.  Maybe they did it because the void event is still a ways off and she needs to be a very basic blob of a character to easily fit into whatever shape they need her to for that event... vengeful hunter, troubled survivor or rallying hero standing against it.  They might not be sure yet, so she has to be very generic to leave her options open for later.\n\nI don't know why she is the way she is.  All I know is that she could have been more.  She could have been one of DOZENS of really deep and interesting characters based on her backstory... from a near-broken soul struggling to adjust to the real world again, to a determined hero that knows people can always overcome because she has seen one of the worst ordeals imaginable and she came through it intact.   She could have been SO MANY THINGS and they're all exciting, interesting and awesome....  because what she IS is barely anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Nylisa","date":"2018-02-26T11:20:50.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you make some good points here, all i can say is that we should wait for her lore see if that changes anything.","replies":[{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2018-02-26T17:00:23.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nylisa,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=PYjJcTJP,comment-id=0005000000010000,timestamp=2018-02-26T11:20:50.954+0000)\n>\n> you make some good points here, all i can say is that we should wait for her lore see if that changes anything.\n\nWell that's really all we CAN do.
