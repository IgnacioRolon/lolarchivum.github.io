All the individual rust stains and marks on Nautilus look like a weird digital pattern when zoomed out. Desperada Cassiopeia's dress looks like a bunch of black and white dots. Old Pentakill Mordekaiser looked like his metal was really fuzzy and was leaking pixels everywhere. Olaf's muscles look like watercolors. WITH PIXELS LEAKING EVERYWHERE.\n\nComplain about the removal of small details all you want, this game doesn't anti-alias hard enough to stop them from just showing up as pixels. Annoying pixels.\n\n---\n\nWhen riot updates skins, and some of the smaller things are gone and colors changed, believe me - there's a reason.","replies":[{"poster":"HigeR","date":"2014-08-29T19:08:57.033+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think there's a middle point in which skins don't need to be super convoluted with details but still remain detailed, for example Cass' desperada skin, they took away lots of details but in return they added several other shapes that aren't microscopically detailed but you can still see the ripples and relieves (is that the word?) In this case though, there seems to be something odd with the palette of the skin in general, her hat has a tone of brown while her top is blue-ish and her tail is brown-beige, plus her tail seriously lost detail unnecessarily and they should re-add the black stripes since this is nor micro detail nor imposible to pull off as we can see in the current skin.\n\nA lot of skins are convoluted with details though and I agree that simplifying them is part of their rework even if most people disagree with it.","replies":[{"poster":"Serpents Embrace","date":"2014-08-29T19:55:12.531+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The tail's contrast still looks awful and muddy, though.
