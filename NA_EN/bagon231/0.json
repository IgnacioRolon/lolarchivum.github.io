Two of which we lost and the other we won. There are two constants in each game: someone who is griefing the match, and me being tilted. Normally, when I tilt, I just /muteall and play the game. I don't think I did in the two that we lost, but that is besides the point. I got queued with people who intentionally tried to make us lose the game and when I say something stupid to them, I get punished. But when I look at all of their profiles, they never got banned. I made sure to report them in each case, and I'm pretty sure by the way my team reacted that they also reported them. I don't get why Riot is punishing me and not the people who actually deserve it, albeit they have me on record saying stupid stuff. Is there any way to unlift my ban? Lack of communication is the number one reason why games are lost.","replies":[]}
