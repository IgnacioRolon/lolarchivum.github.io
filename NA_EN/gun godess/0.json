Anyone knows wth is this? It worked fine just yesterday and then boom! I lost my promo because of this, at the fountain it's light, when I get in lane turns really bad. I updated driver didn't help. If anyone knows how to fix this it would be very appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-28T03:43:03.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Typically I'd want to suggest updating your graphics drivers first to fix that kind of issue, but if you've obviously done that already let's start elsewhere. Since driver's weren't the main issue you might be dealing with some corrupted files in your League installation. Grab our [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and run it with the repatch option selected, then test it out in a custom/practice game. Hit me back and let me know if that helped!","replies":[{"poster":"XxThorsMuaythaxX","date":"2017-04-28T13:14:49.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't help, and I've discovered that it happens in other games too, I mostly play league, sometimes KF, and it does that in there too, it's so weird, it was everything running so good 2 days ago, and now I can't play anything :(","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-28T21:32:10.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since this is starting to happen in other games as well, I'm afraid to say that the main issue might be with your graphics card =\\ . Go ahead and hit up our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) since they can look much deeper at your system specs and such.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
