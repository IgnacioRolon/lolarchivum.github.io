You prance around the middle lane with your cute little waltz and your tiny little voice. And while you sound like a Kardashian and probably don't take actual shits just softly drop adorable pellets like a bunny, we all respect that landing that one Q is all you need for Illumination and Thunderbolts and your combo to almost instantaneously putamuthafucka in the ground.\n\nBut today is about your skin set. Yes those things you probably think of as OMG super cute outfits. And more over, depending on how a summoner decides to dress you up, we have overbearing, scientific proof, of what Lux skin a summoner chooses says about them, as a person, as a player, and as a bloody soul. \n\n**Steel Legion Lux**\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/h84UdLGSh5w/maxresdefault.jpg\nYou are out of touch with your feminine side.\n\nLet's be honest, in one of your early summonings, you got your first taste of a real team battle. Oh my god how exhilarating. You flashed, you maneuvered, landed your CC and just when you thought shit was all good just a week ago, that badass, thicker than Rosie O'Donnell, high velocity LASER that is Final Spark, alllllll the way from Andromeda wrecks 2 of your teammates. \n\nOh what power. Oh what glory. You have been a Jedi all your life, dancing around with your glowsticks doing the most, and now the Death Star just busted up your entire world. Your are probably a Udyr, or an Akali, prideful skilled melee fighter working the keyboard, hard work all the sudden feels foolish and now your struggle feels obsolete. So you drive Lux, how hard can it be I just eat these Doritos until level 6 and run around playing clean up. But wait, wtf? She skips? Why does she sound like my friends 4 year old sister? \n\nAll the sudden you get worried you might cry if you watch certain romantic comedies, you might get out of the shower one day and wrap your towel around your head and feel embarrassed. You tell yourself it is ok, at heart you are still a masculine brawn bruiser, but you find yourself playing GTA and picking up prostitutes and dropping them off in safer parts of the city. Don't panic you can still love Lux, as much of a girly girl that she is, and still be the macho figure you need to be. You decided to buy this STEEL LEGION skin. You can't even tell it's a woman. Looks like armor. You feel remediated.\n\nMy advice is to get a pedicure. Be open to your feminine side. Those 3 other soaps that you can't comprehend why your girlfriend has them in the shower, use them. Feels good doesn't it.\n\n**Imperial Lux**\nhttp://www.leagueoflegendsskins.com/images/champions/splash/Lux_4.jpg\nYou make really bad decisions very often. You sometimes microwave leftovers with forks in the bowl. You feed your dog chocolate. I don't know why you would think this deformity is a good look. It is like someone stirred genetic material from M.Bison and Captain Crunch and threw it into one of Muammar Gaddafi's amazonian guards and this came out. I am shaking my proverbial head at you, it is ok. Take the L, and move on. There are people in burn ward 4 who wouldn't even want this skin. \n\n**Commando Lux**\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/34ouB9MWuIk/maxresdefault.jpg\nYeah yeah we all know. You saw the fucking flamethrower. Yeah, I know, there was no flame throwing. It is ok. You made the right call. You are good genuine person. If I could let you watch my kids, I would. You have a really good head on your shoulders. Keep doing what you are doing. Most people don't get it, You do, if you have an opportunity to be on the operational side of a flamethrower you take it. Job well done. Even though things didn't work out this time, trust me, a flame thrower is in your immediate future.\n\n**Spellthief Lux**\nhttp://www.leagueoflegendsskins.com/images/champions/splash/Lux_2.jpg\nYou my friend are a very strange, unique and weird person. Let's start with the skin graphic. WTF is going on here? Did she just accidentally step on wet cement? Did she just fart out loud at your grandpa's funeral? It is almost like you got all the way to the airport and you just realized you probably didn't lock the door. I don't know bro, I have never been inside a blind person's house trying to steal sensitive documents, only to have them show up while I am there and trying to sneak out, but I imagine is this is how I would act and dress. Whatever drove you to this skin, is the same thing that drove you to build a hair doll. Different strokes for different folks. I say own your peculiarities. Be proud you are a three dollar bill.\n\n**Sorceress Lux**\nhttp://www.leagueoflegendsskins.com/images/champions/splash/Lux_1.jpg\nYou are a pervert. Haha. You saw those thigh high laced leggings and you couldn't wait to /dance. Well I am sorry to leave you HAT and bothered. I crack myself up. But unless your ultimate gift is sultry calendar of the sorting hat from harry potter, this skin might not be for you my flirty little friend.\n\n**Star Guardian Lux**\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/starguardian_lux_splash_1920.jpg?itok=7mjICwWQ\nYou are a liar. Yeah I know the animations of this skin make it very useful in deceiving your opponent. You gotta chill with that. You have been watching to many faker compilations on youtube. If you are at that level of meta where the skin and animations are important, than you are far and beyond the world of reading this. \n\nSo let's get down to the real truth behind why you picked Star Guardian. Stop lying. You love this skin. This skin is culmination of all that Lux is. Girly. Pink. Lights. Cute. Stars. Candy. Just admit it. Be honest with yourself. You have always wanted to take Sailor Moon, dip her in cotton candy, and cross breed her with a care bear, cover it in sprinkles and cuddle with it. Just be honest. Star Guardian Lux is Lux. And you love the color pink. You do love puppies. You do like Adele.\n\nI hope this post serves as a mirror. Lux is life. Let's all cheese out over the coming ELEMENTAL LUX. Which I will tell you know if you choose this skin you are a murdering betrayer. Star Guardian Rules! All Else Drooools.","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-10-31T05:13:18.010+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"downvoting for dissing my nazi goddes skin!\n\nedit: you're probably noxus scum!\n\nedit 2:upvoted cuz lux thread","replies":[]},{"poster":"EvilUnicornLord","date":"2016-10-29T18:45:58.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What in the world...","replies":[{"poster":"Wallybeezy","date":"2016-10-30T17:43:09.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha sometimes it is good to have a laugh","replies":[{"poster":"EvilUnicornLord","date":"2016-10-30T18:13:59.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, my turn.
