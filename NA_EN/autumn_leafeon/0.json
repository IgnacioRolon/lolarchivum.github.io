I also had materials and champion shards from before the new client, but none of them are there. I even bought a champion shard token for IP and that didn't show up either. This is all supposed to be done in the loot tab right? So all i can see is my essence. Please help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-30T23:02:14.871+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this for you, and nothing seems to be missing so your issue may be a visual one.  What happens if you return to the legacy client:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nAre your shards and tokens still there?  If so, report this over at the [client discussion](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) boards so our client devs can receive that feedback.  Let me know if that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Autumn Leafeon","date":"2016-12-01T00:52:44.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It did help!  Thank you so much!  So my stuff is indeed still there on the legacy client.  So as you suspected, it must be a visual issue.  I will do as you suggested and go to the client board.  Thanks again!","replies":[]}]}]}
