Well today i was playing norms just for shit and gigles and i left the chat on.  and this dude/chick just kept going im tilted.....so after about the 12 time of attention whoring of saying im tilted....I finally piped up and asked so why you mad......and this insecure kid went and explained how their is a difference in being tilted and being mad.....by saying if i say im mad im mad...if i say im tilted im tilted their is a difference.\r\n\r\n\r\n I just wanna make sure the only difference, is the fact the kid does not understand what a verb is.  As at the end of the day, i also dont want to be the old guy, that just thinks is a verb difference, and it actually mean something different. so thats why i asked.","replies":[]}
