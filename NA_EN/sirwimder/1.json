Responding to toxicity with more toxicity isn't helpful, and won't inspire someone to change their behavior.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2020-01-16T06:26:45.499+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What does keeping it real have to do with insulting people?

Then me telling you that what you said was incensitive to the feelings of others, will instantly have the person yelling and scream about look at this safespace mf here....When if they posted in the section that you could respond in kind to the post...that has this language and wont get removed....can go hey dipshit you cant say flying fucking moron who could not fuck his way into a condom....are you retarted....read that back if someone said that to you would you laugh or wanna skull f their face...if its the 2nd maybe you should nto say something like that...as it will get you banned.

Meeting aggression with aggression isn't the best approach in most situations, especially when one person is at an elevated level of tension from a recent punishment.\n\nIdeally you need to speak in a calming tone, but not cross the line to patronizing. This is already a tough thing to do in many cases, partly due to the fact that text doesn't really have a tone. People will read and think whatever tone they want to hear.\n\nSo again, you don't need to match aggression with aggression just to \"keep it real\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Modi","date":"2020-01-16T15:53:35.212+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SirXerath,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=rNaiUELl,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2020-01-16T06:35:34.132+0000)\n>\n> Growing up my father always taught me to talk to my audience.

Emphasis on the word \"teach\".\n\nYou don't teach people by insulting them, belittling them, etc., you teach them through patience. Explain what they did wrong, what they should do going forward, and don't insult them.\n\nBecause insulting someone is a surefire way to get them to double-down, go on the defensive, and learn exactly _nothing_.\n\n> You dont teach a blind person a language, using sign lauguage.\n\nThis is probably the strangest non-sequitur I've seen yet.\n\nHere's a more appropriate phrase; \"_You catch more flies with honey than you can with vinegar._\" You won't find people readily accepting your points or learning anything if you embitter them with insults.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-01-16T07:25:58.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think Boards will ever have a section where it's okay to \"rost\" people.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dromar421","date":"2020-01-16T06:06:01.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can be real in this forum.
