I know the team who handles the mastery system is aware that some health bars are covering mastery emotes a bit. While I don't have an ETA on a fix for this, I'd be happy to poke them and give them a friendly reminder that this is still occurring and you aren't able to BM (read: show off your skills). :)","replies":[{"poster":"i pyk kotwica","date":"2017-04-01T10:54:17.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, im sorry to bump the thread, but its 2017-04 and the issue still wasnt fixed, i remember it was said in some patch notes or somewhere that it was fixed, but in reality it wasnt.
