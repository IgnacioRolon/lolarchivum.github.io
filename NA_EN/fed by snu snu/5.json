They had one chance and they had to make it count, then catch up, then repeat. Lanes actually had breathing space.\n\nAnd we also had much more reliable warding. Now we have so many blind spots and time that it's all to their advantage.\n\nLater on we had the feral flare and devourer silliness, but still.\n\nLanes were also not pretty much over with a single kill. Right now a death at level 6 means the lane's pretty much done due to just 1 level disadvantage. And most junglers currently even go as far as to wait until you return to the lane so that they get an easy kill (since you've blown summoners) and you're done. Why? Because they have the luxury to wait, why not just go for the overkill and ensure that you have absolutely 0% chance to come back into even being able to contest creeps from now on.","replies":[{"poster":"TittiesRUs","date":"2017-05-07T04:04:08.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a reason farming junglers have never been meta...","replies":[]}]}]}]}
