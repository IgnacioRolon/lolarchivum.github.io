You can't simply circumvent a part of the system that's always calculating your ELO. It's how the entire system works. The calculations are pretty minor when you're on your main that has a heap of ranked games under its belt, where the system has already confidently placed you somewhere and you're only gaining a few points up and down when you win or lose.\n\n\n- However, the system needs to estimate your ELO if you have a new account and that's being done in provisional games. And then, your jumps or dips for wins or losses are big because after the initial estimation, there comes proper \"calibration\". The more ranked games you play, the more accurate your ELO will be.\n\nThis account i'm writing from is my ex-main i haven't played on for over 3 years. I had it for 8 years already and that's pretty early in League's days. I made a smurf 3 years ago because i wanted to move way from my dirt cheap ELO (where i was experimenting on how to properly play ranked) and my new main account's ELO has been steadily rising from Gold to Plat to Diamond 4 last season. And i'm not getting back to my forgotten accounts to ruin someone's ranked games, i am using this account only for the forums while i use my other account for everything else.\n\nI consider myself to be a good smurf. I see no reason why i should have to be stuck to just one account but i acknowledge the fact that if i make new accounts, i am responsible for them as they were my mains. And in my opinion, i only want to have 1 account i play on regularly. I don't want to have side accounts or \"troll\" accounts for any reason or purpose.\nI'm not trying to stockpile them for the future when i get banned because i'm not toxic and i don't have to worry about this problem.\n\n_**Bad smurfing**_\n\n- Is when a person has a second account (or more) that he uses for experiments in Ranked games or is purposely keeping his ELO low so that he can stomp lower ELO players (because he loses on his main or he is circumventing a punishment because of his toxicity on his main). Essentially, his ELO is higher on his main and he usually plays there but every once in a while, the urge to stomp some noobs or troll people is too great so he switches accounts and doesn't really care what happens to his side account if he ever crosses the line and gets punished.\n\n\n- Bad smurfing is also trying to carry your lower ELO friend by making a fresh account that has ELO equal or less than his but that allows you (a higher ELO player) to influence his games and manipulate wins that he likely didn't deserve.","replies":[]},{"poster":"grug","date":"2017-05-06T04:56:26.351+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":11,"body":"I have no problem with people smurfing as I believe it raises the bar for lower ELo players to get better, I still believe it is an impetus for improvement.\nRealistically, everyone that has seriously climbed has been stomped mercilessly by smurfs on several occasions.
