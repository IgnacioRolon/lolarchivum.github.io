I've even seen the odd minion get stuck in an allied turret, which often can be the difference between taking and not taking an enemy turret. The worst is that it's impossible to understand minion aggro, when you poke the enemy laner once and their minions chase you under turret, but when they straight up kill you, your minions don't even look.\n\nTheir behaviour has been off ever since they tweaked them, just dealt with it thus far, though your thread has reminded me how erratic and inconsistent they are.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Derfel","date":"2017-05-09T22:05:43.105+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've never seen a wave agro {{champion:157}} so working as intended","replies":[]},{"poster":"Catastrop","date":"2017-05-10T00:47:35.698+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've given up trying to figure out creep aggro.
