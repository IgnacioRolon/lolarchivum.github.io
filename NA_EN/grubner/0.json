Yi can only kill someone in 2 seconds when its late game and he has items, and at that point any atk speed AD champ can do that.\n\n2. Ashe stun only last that long from cross map hit, easy to dodge unless you were trying to be hit on purpose.\n\n3. I bet you think annie is broken also huh?\n\nYou made a post about \"do you ever read something and think you're losing IQ from reading it\" or something along those lines, That's how everyone is feeling about your ashe post.\n\nAnd even further when you included the yi comment. of course an ADC melee champion will melt people eventually he's meant to, just as much with ADC marksman.","replies":[{"poster":"Grubner","date":"2018-05-31T07:14:55.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":10,"body":"so wait, you feel the same way sometimes and you didnt reply? damnit. \n\nalso ashe deals too much damage, her passive is INSANE.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-05-31T07:22:51.109+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Grubner,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=tEG6MW4G,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2018-05-31T07:14:55.790+0000)\n>\n> so wait, you feel the same way sometimes and you didnt reply? damnit. \n> \n> also ashe deals too much damage, her passive is INSANE.\n\nIf you were to actually want to have a 1% plausible argument against ashe being \"op\", you would argue her W early game or Q after 1 item while combining the interaction from Q with her passive.\n\nNot her ult which needs extreme conditions to make a 5 second stun or the passive itself.","replies":[{"poster":"Grubner","date":"2018-05-31T07:24:46.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"Ur just trying to change the subject.

No really. If were talking about American law, the First Amendment only applies to the government making laws that prohibit speech and, even then, freedom of speech isnt absolute. For example, you cant incite a riot, plan to kill the president or yell fire in a crowded theater.\n\n>Also, theres nothing in the First Amendment that protects you from the consequences of your speech. People are fired all the time for making derogatory comments about their employer. My workplace, for example, has a social media policy that says that I can be terminated for badmouthing the company. They dont ask for passwords and access as some companies have been known to do, but it wouldnt be all that difficult to find me on the internet, knowing my real name, phone number and address.","replies":[]}]}
