Leaverbuster was designed with a bit of leniency so that your first few leaves won't trigger a punishment. The fact that you have the 20 minute LPQ shows that you have been punished by Leaverbuster a few times already. This means that you have already used up that leniency and then some in the past, so a single leave could very well trigger another punishment for you.\n\nFor more information about Leaverbuster, you can read this [FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714).","replies":[{"poster":"Rayyat","date":"2016-12-20T02:21:43.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is a new account and i only leave once on this account","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-20T02:20:18.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it's impossible to see a Leaverbuster penalty without a *recent trend* of disconnections occurring on your account.
