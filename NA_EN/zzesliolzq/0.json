So random that unless the fight is in the baron pit or dragon pit, it will get 2 bounces on average. It moves quite slow and can easily be stopped (Braum, Yasuo). It can be easily stopped by cc'ing him on the windup. Banshees is still extremely viable stopping it. Even Bards' ult will stop it (although if we are going this route, Bards' ult will stop everything lol). The bounce range is still really small, so easily counterable by taking two steps away from your team.\n\nBut. I do agree that there are possibly other alternatives out there. Regardless, Brand needs a bit of help somewhere.","replies":[{"poster":"Knight SoIaire ","date":"2015-03-02T22:12:44.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Thing is, Brand does not have overwhelming damage at all.\nThe bounces of his ult, as you say, are very random.\n\nthe damage is top tier \nbut the single target damage is quite random warying beetwen owerwhelming and medicore \n\nowerall would go for alternative changes, instead of tweaking the randomness","replies":[{"poster":"Bijorn","date":"2015-03-03T14:32:08.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hagane No Arashi,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QhI4X4gP,comment-id=0001000200010000,timestamp=2015-03-02T22:12:44.176+0000)\n>\n> The bounces of his ult, as you say, are very random.\n> \n> the damage is top tier \n> but the single target damage is quite random warying beetwen owerwhelming and medicore \n> \n> owerall would go for alternative changes, instead of tweaking the randomness\n\nI would agree with the damage being \"top tier\" if you got multiple bounces (2+) off in a teamfight (like in baron or dragon pit). \n\nI guess im saying the damage is not overwhelming/top tier due to it hitting more often than not 2 or less targets. If the RNG was changed/the range between champs that can be bounced to was increased I think that would really help his ult.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-03-02T03:11:56.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ehh some ultimate abilites have a rather short cooldown... like stances Nidalee and Jayce (Udyr?)...

To do that I think either it needs to prioritize champs regardless of if they are ablaze, or increase the distance between champs so that it can bounce to them instead of going to minions.\n\nI am  sure there are much better ideas/ways to make his Ult \"better\".

It's already hard enough trying to land skill shot combos (with super high cd's) on all the hyper mobility champions in this game when they easily dodge them a large amount of the time. But it just always feels super shitty when you cast what you think is a \"good\" ult and it ends up doing nothing due to untargettable, flash, or a champion uses a dash/blink/teleport ability. Or Braum/Yasuo throw up their shield wall and cancel out my Ulimate with a normal ability. There are just too many situations like this to count. I feel like I spend an extreme amount of effort trying to identify the correct opportunity to Ult and then a large % of the time my Ultiimate is just entirely ineffective. \n\nI really feel like Brand's entire kit is awesome, synergizes well, and is in harmony with his theme. It would just be nice if he wasn't gimped by an ultimate that is so easy to render ineffective. I feel like his utter lack of mobility, defense, and reliable damage just always keeps him from ever being competitive (even in solo queue). It would be nice if the balance team could figure out a way to give him something (small) in any of these 3 categories to help overcome these 3 glaring weaknesses; WITHOUT DESTROYING him like you did Veigar. If adding some power to his kit in any of the 3 above mentioned weak areas causes you to want to entirely redesign the champion and make him even less reliable. DON'T TOUCH HIM PLEASE. I feel like he needs SMALL adjustments to be relevant in the current state of the game. NOT A MASSIVE REDESIGN. \n\nAgain my major complaint is how unreliable his damage is and how easy it is for all the mobility champions in the game to entirely dodge his damage. This coupled with high cds and and a super unreliable ultimate makes me feel often that I'm just not competitive against players on champs with mobility.","replies":[]}]}
