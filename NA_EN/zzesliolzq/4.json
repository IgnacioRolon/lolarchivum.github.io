Rune is 30% ratio with a 100% base AD ratio that turns the ENTIRE attack, that means an Ez's Q and Fizz's Q, into Magic Damage rather than dealing physical. It also synergizes well with Diana's kit, making her AoE-loving kit do lots more AoE while also making her AA do lots of damage.\n\nI'll even compare it for you. Say you have 500 AP with this item and 530 with the Lichbane.\n\n500 AP on this item makes your next AA do around 100 base damage which is now magic, another 100 because of its ratio, and 30% of your AP, so that's 100+100+150, so 350. Lichbane does 75% of your base AD and 50% of your AP, so that's 100 base PHYSICAL, 75 Magic, and 265 magic, totaling 340 magic and 100 physical. That's just for a standard AA though. There's about a 90 damage difference prior to resistances. Most have about 80ish MR and about 100 Armor, but say you have a void, so you ignore 40% of their MR.\n\nWe're at 48 MR and 100 armor. 100 armor is 50% reduction. Formula is MR/(MR+100). You likely have another 23 MPen. 8 from runes, 15 from boots. So that's 25 MR left. 25 MR is 20% reduction. That means the Rune will do about 280. The Lich would do 50 physical and 272 magical. That means there's about a 42 damage difference on your average carry. Literally 42. That's almost negligible. lol. \n\nSay we want to use a tank though! That's about 200 armor and 100 MR, pretty standard stuff. 200 Armor is about 67% reduction. 100 MR is 50%, however we ignore 40% of it and another 23, bringing us down to 37. (100-40% is 60, minus 23 is 37). 37 MR is about 27% reduction. So Rune does 255.5 damage. Lich does 33 physical and 248.2 damage.

If you read carefully:\n> Lich Bane: After using an ability, your next basic attack deals 75% base AD (+ 50% AP) **BONUS** magic damage. 1.5 second cooldown.\n\n>Runeglaive: After using an ability, your next basic attack is converted to deal magic damage **PLUS** 75% base AD (+30% AP) **BONUS** damage in an area around the target. Applies spell effects. (1.5 second cooldown).\n\nLet's use Ezreal as an example and illustration shall we?\n\nLevel 18 Ezreal has 101 base Attack Damage. Let's say he has 650 Ability Power, and he does not build any items/runes/masteries  that gives him more **base Attack Damage**/**bonus Attack Damage**, so his total Attack Damage remains 101.\n\nWith Runeglaive:\n\nHis Q's component = 115 + 101 x 110% + 650 x 40% = 486.1\n\nPlus\n\nSpellblade passive bonus Magic Damage = 101 x 75% + 650 x 30% = 270.75\n\nSo the total Magic Damage he deals upon using Q = 486.1 + 210.75 = 786.85\n\nNot to mention since Runeglaive's unique passive activates spell effects, Luden's Echo's unique passive will be proced too, assuming he has Luden's Echo and Luden's Echo is at full charge, but let's not talk about the numbers on Luden's Echo's unique passive, for simplicity's sake. Also with Runeglaive, Ezreal's Q is completely converted into magic damage which synergizes well with any magic penetration runes/masteries/items (if any) you have applied on Ezreal. It works extremely well with Abyssal Sceptor (Not a very nice item on Ezreal since almost all of his abilities revolves around ranged pokes) /Void Staff.\n\nWith Lich Bane:\n\nhis Q component = 486.1\n\nPlus\n\nSpellblade passive bonus Magic Damage = 101 x 75% + 650 x 50% = 400.75\n\nTotal = 486.1 (Physical Damage from Ezreal's Q) + 400.75 (Magic Damage component from Spellblade passive) = 886.85\n\nEzreal's Q is Physical Damage component, so it doesn't benefit from magic penetration. Granted that it deals more damage (130 more damage) in total, but half of the damage is Physical Damage (which doesn't do much for AP Ezreal), and the other half is Magic Damage. Moreover, Ezreal's Q does not proc Luden's Echo's unique passive since it isn't treated as a spell. It only procs on-hit effects like Spellblade.\n\nConclusion (TL;DR): Both builds have their advantages and disadvantages. Just because Runeglaive doesn't deal as much damage in total does not mean it's a bad idea to build it on AP Ezreal.\n\nSorry again for misunderstandings if I misunderstand your post. But the the above conclusion remains.\n\n**EDIT**: I totally forgot to mention that most AP Runeglaive Ezreal players build Skirmisher's Sabre, thus making their smite Challenging Smite. This is important because it makes every basic attack and his Qs proc extra true damage on the Smited enemy champions. I don't need to go through the numbers right?","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-07-01T22:02:03.850+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"See, this guy understands.

The other actual junglers that are ap don't really benefit from it as well as they did the old version, which is what bothers people.\n\nSure, it is cute and all that Ezreal can use it, but that sort of isn't the point of the item, and if anything is going to get it nerfed if people start using it on him, hence why Cinderhulk got nerfed most recent with all the top laners taking it.\n\nSame reason the old (pre-the new summoner's rift jungle items) jungle item got nerfed with Ez using it too much (not just Ez but he was the main offender).\n\n\nIf part of your argument is, non-junglers can use it and do good, that is a terrible argument, and only further points out why it isn't a good item, because it is not only worse on previous AP junglers, it actually lowers the amount of viable AP junglers (which one of the Rioters flat out said that exact thing on the most recent patch rundown).\n\nPretty sure an item that makes LESS champions viable in the jungler and causes MORE non-junglers to use it in lane...is bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Messaiga","date":"2015-07-01T15:51:12.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thing is.... how many remotely popular AP Junglers (talking about non-tanks even if a few tanks scale well with AP) are there?  {{champion:76}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:28}} These champions mostly come to mind.

The problem is that it's not good in the jungle.\n\nI never said cinderhulk was bad, nor did I say it was bad that non-junglers played it, because given how pro top laners played, with thier early taking camps and so on and so forth, it made sense, and it worked. \n\nCinderhulk in general was just sort of strong, but it wasn't problematic. The problem, and what my point was, having an item that is better on someone out of the jungle, compared to a lot of junglers, is bad. \n\nFiddle worked fine with Magus, but he rarely auto attacks in the jungle, because you rarely, if ever aren't draining or some such to have time to auto, so it mostly just nerfed him with less ap.\n\nThe problem I have with Ez using it specifically, is because we have already seen a case where a good jungle item was picked up on Ez, then nerfed pretty roughly (the old map and jungle items) and then it was bad on everyone.\n\nWhen items are picked up on people Riot doesn't want them picked up on, it rarely, if ever, ends good.\n\nWe can go all the way back to Heart of Gold, which was mainly meant to be a way for junglers to get passive gold and some health (there weren't as many easy ways for health then in comparison, outside of a few cases). Just about every laner started taking Heart of Gold, what happened? Riot straight up deleted it from the game so no one could use it, which hurt jungler gold income for a bit.\n\nAn jungle item being good, not on a jungler, but a laner, is bad in my opinion. Riot still, somehow, hasn't learn how to balance an item to be attractive to junglers and not laners, and it ends up the items are attractive for laners and not junglers.\n\nI don't get how they still haven't figured it out for as many times as it has happened, especially with Ezreal.","replies":[{"poster":"Mandang0","date":"2015-07-01T15:05:13.411+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, this time the interactions are a bit screwy and I wouldn't be surprised if they get cleaned up.
