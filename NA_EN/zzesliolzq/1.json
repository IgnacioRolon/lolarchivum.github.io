Even on someone who builds a shit ton of AP but has shitty ratios like Lulu!, after only 2 basic attacks on top of EQ, _you more burst with DC_.\n\n\nThis is all completely moot when you have both Ludens AND DC because by getting Luden's early, you have superior poke and waveclear.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HouseCat01","date":"2015-05-03T18:14:21.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lil Soybean,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tE4UnkRl,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-05-03T08:48:18.940+0000)\n>\n> I thought it was totally fine, then I realized it's most beneficial for the most anti-fun opponents.\n> \n> People like Kat and Leblanc can buy it for both crazy burst and insane poke.
