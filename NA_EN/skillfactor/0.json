Non stop fluctuation from 60 fps down to 20 constantly. Its like clockwork up and down up and down , causing a stutter that would make a saint smash a monitor through a wall. Tried system restore, defrag, antivirus ,reload graphics drivers , repair game, lower video settings, v-sync, legacy client, end process league client.exe while playing. Nothing helps. Really sucks.

Given the specs that OP posted, I wouldn't really consider they setup *low-end*, given they have at least 8GB of RAM and a solid processor.\n\nSince I'm not on the teams that work on the League Client, I cannot give you a specific reason why the client runs in the background. If I had to guess, it's probably related to keeping you connected to the chat and matchmaking services. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TooAsianTooGood","date":"2016-11-28T15:30:46.687+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"that is interesting. i am wondering if we can allocate resources to background programs?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Skillfactor","date":"2016-11-28T22:29:58.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Played with the client shutdown as well, no change.

I run other games without any issue and League should not be any different. But after repairing, uninstalling, updating drivers, trying different drivers, nothing changes.
