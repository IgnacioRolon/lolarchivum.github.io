All the bad player will become a crying baby and saying \"I will report you\" \"Report this guy\". They don't even know how to play and feeding and this riot bans who actually try to win. I think this is why NA is so bad and so many noobs are playing. They just report good people like people who knows how to play because they said something to them. This stupid system is just causing more crying noobs.","replies":[{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2015-02-11T07:54:06.863+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is a difference between trying to win, and telling someone they need to kill themselves because they had a bad game.
