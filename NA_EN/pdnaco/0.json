Could you have been thinking of a different account possibly, or one on a different region than NA?

I've always been playing in NA. Yes this PdNaCO account has never been over level 1, but this isn't my account.

I was able to find the account in the screenshot, and that one is active and is in fact level 30. It sounds like you might just be logging into the wrong account. You may just be using the wrong username when trying to login, but if you're still having problems getting signed into the account in the screenshot, reach out to our account team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they can help.","replies":[{"poster":"PdNaCO","date":"2017-09-28T04:26:14.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, it just seems like the username and pass that I've been using for years doesn't sign me into the lvl30 account anymore, like it should! Instead, it signs me on to this PdNaCO. the lvl 30 acc (in the 2nd screenshot) is the one i've been using since season 3. It's like riot has gave away my acc and assigned me a new one what the heck.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-28T04:52:22.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We can't actually change usernames, so that's definitely not what happened. I can see these two accounts are completely separate and you're logging into PdNaCO because you're using the username and pass associated with that account, and not the one you're wanting to login to. If you can't remember the other username, feel free to use the [**Forgot my Username**](https://account.leagueoflegends.com/eune/en/forgot-username) option, or go ahead and shoot us that ticket.","replies":[{"poster":"PdNaCO","date":"2017-09-28T17:03:42.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also shot you guys a ticket but got no reply","replies":[]},{"poster":"PdNaCO","date":"2017-09-28T16:50:55.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes..
