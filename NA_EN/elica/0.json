Stubborn mouse buttons >_>.....\n\nThe best way to get that working again would be to reset your config files entirely. Follow these steps in a custom game, and let me know if that fixes it!\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[{"poster":"Elica","date":"2017-04-03T03:25:02.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I couldn't change.. it doesn't has any reaction when I want to change it to MB1 on player attack move click.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-03T03:38:36.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhh sorry I misunderstood! Being able to change MB1 and MB2 is not currently a feature we have, so I'm not sure there will be any way for you to change that keybind. If you were able to unbind MB1 and can't get it back on, try resetting your config files using the steps I mentioned earlier. \n\nIf you still want to see if there's any way possible to change that MB1, reach out to us in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and our tech guys might have a trick up their sleeve!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
