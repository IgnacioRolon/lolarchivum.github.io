I&#039;m just a little confused, is all.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve searched around and couldn&#039;t really find anything about how they became friends or... how it even works. Mainly, to me, I just imagine Lulu bugging Veigar a lot while he yells at her, but, being Lulu, she doesn&#039;t listen and still tries to be his friend or something.\r\n\r\nAre there actually lore type resources where this is explained? Or am I just.... looking into this too much?","replies":[{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2015-03-28T01:04:20.427+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair, the relationship between them makes sense (as explained in the thread that A Superb Villain posted)\n\nBut in my personal opinion, i believe that Veigar may be interested in the powers that Lulu (and the glade) has. After all, he has mastered almost all the dark magics of Valoran... but he knows nothing about The Glade Magic. So... it would make sense if he wants to learn that magic from Lulu.\n\nAfter all, the glade magic can increase his size. And imagine what would Veigar do if he learns that kind of magic... He would be able to turn everyone into dogs and rule the world or something like that(?).","replies":[{"poster":"Nameless Hero","date":"2015-03-30T05:34:54.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Retconning a Veigar x Lulu friendship/romance was a bad idea. \n\nNot lore wise or character-wise. \n\nBut because this Lulu line is now horrifying in retrospect. \n\n\n\"Yep, that tasted purple\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeloricVI","date":"2015-03-28T01:11:48.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man... if he could polymorph things...
