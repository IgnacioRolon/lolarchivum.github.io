I have searched through the forums, with people saying \"run discord on admin\". This wasn't the case at all. The problem was with Discord overlay, and I'm assuming it will also happen to any other overlay applications like Overwolf. Try closing overwolf and disabling Discord overlay and see if it works.\n\nEdit: Kind Porocles has confirmed that it is** Discord Overlay**, just _**disable the overlay**_ and you should be good!\nEdit2: Here are the steps to disabling the overlay for those who don't know:\n1) Go to your user settings which can be found on the bottom left: https://i.imgur.com/4xWo9EZ.png\n2)  Go to the overlay section and turn off \"Enable in-game overlay\": https://i.imgur.com/5VJ6Rrh.png\n","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-23T15:06:52.143+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys, I wanted to confirm that this is likely the issue going on.  Our tech team has been seeing bugsplat and client crashes recently, and the culprit appears to be **Discord Overlay**. \n\nDisabling it for now should do the trick, and I recommend reporting to Discord's bug team to investigate.  Thanks for making this post and sharing the fix, jakehead20!\n\n\n**Running As Admin:**  Some players may need to run League As Administrator after disabling the overlay.  This is because Discord is in a state of limbo, so to speak, but still taking priority.  Running as Admin forces League to take the front stage again.
