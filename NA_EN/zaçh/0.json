(there are other threads with more people confirming it). Some said to go to the installation folder and run lol.launcher.admin as an administrator and it fixed it for them. But for alot of us, it didn't. You can try though, maybe you are lucky. It seems to be an issue with riot. uninstalling/reinstalling does not seem to fix it. We will just have to wait on Rito to fix it. {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"NauticalXD","date":"2017-08-12T17:05:34.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is my day off and I just wanted to sit down and listen to music while I played a bit of league.
