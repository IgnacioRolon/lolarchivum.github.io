You want to talk about your girlfriend on LoL so that everyone will think that you&#039;re not just some internet nerd playing a videogame while jacking it to waifu pictures on the internet. You&#039;re a player, who&#039;s banging a hot chick whenever you&#039;re not playing this game, but i&#039;ll let you in on a little secret... **Nobody cares.**\r\n\r\nSeriously. You talking about your girl has literally nothing to do with the game, and it just makes you look like you&#039;re talking out your ass when you talk about how hot, and amazing at sex your girl is, and how much you love having a girlfriend. \r\n\r\nThe same thing applies to kids who say &quot;lol i&#039;m so high/drunk right now.&quot;","replies":[]}
