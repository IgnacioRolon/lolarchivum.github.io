I suggest using the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to fix this up.  You can download the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to help make some of those processes a bit easier for you.  It's really important to get that fixed up, otherwise you may encounter penalties like [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ).  Even if it's not intentiona, those leaves still cause negative experiences for other players so the system treats it equally.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
