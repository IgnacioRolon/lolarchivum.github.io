One was in a game on jungle Rammus. At the start of the game, I take my blue, got to take my red, but the opposing junger, Wukong, took my red. I then rush over to his red to see if it's there. It was still there, so I took it. I go back to my own jungle, and their Wukong catches me out in my own jungle when we both were at around half health. We fight each other, somehow I end up actually getting the kill on Wukong. I then typed in all chat \"That's what you get for taking my blue\"\n\nAnother game, this time playing jungle Braum on Purple side, my team ends up losing a skirmish in the top lane, leaving me alone to defend myself. I run over to the top lane brushes, and as the opposing Twisted Fate and Thresh tried to cut me off from getting back to my team's top lane outer turret, I juke them by running over to the blue side outer turret, and escape by running through the turret and through the jungle back to the rest of my team.\n\nOn one of the few somewhat recent games I played on Cho'gath top, I remember skirmishes in the mid game where I would sometimes use my rupture well behind the enemy Caitlyn, only to watch her net into my rupture.\n\nAnother game on Rammus top I had this funny situation where around 50% of my kills would come from the opposing team towerdiving me, whether it was the opposing team's jungle Hecarim trying to dive me to get a kill or a teamfight where I was 2-3 items in on my build against the relatively low damage of the enemy team's front line. I got a triple kill in that team fight just because the enemy team decided to towerdive me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RocksCanFly","date":"2014-08-11T09:53:49.677+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"After watching my friend ruin the enemy team as critplank{{champion:41}} I managed to convince him to teach me to play this game, since I was new I bought the best l champion I could afford, poppy in my mind {{champion:78}}, and lined up in a 1v1.

I make it to the wall, Volibear charging at me on all fours, ready to flip me into his allies. I smash D and flash over the wall, thinking that I have luckily escaped Voli's wrath. I was terribly, terribly wrong. As I'm flashing, Volibear scoops his arms into the ground in front of him and throws them up into the air. Even though I had managed to flash the wall, that dreaded flip had somehow connected onto me the split second before I flashed. The next two seconds were the longest seconds of my life.
