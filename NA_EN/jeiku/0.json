If your friend got permanently banned for misbehavior, and the ban wasn't placed in error, then they're not getting unbanned, no matter how many players in the community ask for it.\n\nIf you get drunk and decide to play League of Legends, that's your mistake. If you break the rules while playing League of Legends drunk, that's your mistake. It's the same way in real life - if you go about doing shit drunk, and break the rules, you get punished for them. Being intoxicated is no excuse.\n\nIf your friend learned from this, they can start up a new account and stay off the bottle when they're getting on the Rift.
