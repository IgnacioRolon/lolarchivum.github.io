Stop making unbased assumptions.\n\nIf you want, you can ask Riot for chat logs of any other games where you were validly reported, and they might be able to find some for you. Very rarely does a punishment occur for exactly one game of misbehavior. I'd be surprised if this was the only time you've ever gotten rude teammates who tilted you.\n\nYes, you can be an honorable player for months. And you can also stop being an honorable player, at which point you will lose that Honor progress.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meowing Mango","date":"2020-02-12T14:51:09.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Krσnos,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=vsEwzo3R,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2020-02-12T09:43:08.852+0000)\n>\n> You claim i'm doing it regularly , i'm not it was just  from this frustrating game , my problem with the system is that you can be an honorable player for months  but as soon as you slip up once its down to the depths of chat restricts. Stop making unbased assumptions.\n\nHonestly, you shouldn't try to claim you're some kind of angel.\n\nI would bet money you are like this in your games at least frequently enough that you got in trouble. Most players who claim they don't do anything wrong in chat are guilty like 9/10 times. \n\nBut it's going to go full circle. If you want to avoid future problems in games, quantifiably, the system tracks \"volume\" of chat. If you say one stupid thing, you'll probably be OK. Say enough where you can literally grab lines of text, then you'll probably get in trouble instead. It's that simple.\n\nThere is a reason why people who don't say a word can avoid any punishment. I am not saying you need to mute yourself, but I would have muted you myself and reported you after the game with what you have shared in your original post.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aneirin","date":"2020-02-13T02:03:33.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Krσnos,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=vsEwzo3R,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2020-02-12T09:43:08.852+0000)\n>\n> You claim i'm doing it regularly , i'm not it was just  from this frustrating game , my problem with the system is that you can be an honorable player for months  but as soon as you slip up once its down to the depths of chat restricts.
