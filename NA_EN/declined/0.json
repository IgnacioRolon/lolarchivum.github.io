If the character limit was increased significantly there would be a HUGE post every time you changed a page, that is a rubbish solution due to redundancy data requested by the user, putting a rather large strain on both the system and the readers machine.\n3. **Discussion view**\nI'll be honest, it looks like complete crap, and I have no idea which part belongs where.\n4. **Post limitations**\nPosts have significantly decreased post limits compared to the OP, furthermore despite having used the same method when posting picture, they are somehow bugged in all the following posts. \n5. **Formatting options**\nI would like some clear instructions on how the formatting options work here, including but not limited to, imbedding, lists, symbols, special characters and more.\n\n\nWhile I'm at it, I would also like to point out that this thread looks absolutely horrible on a tablet, actually it is close to unreadable.\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/tips-tricks/sa6BvE7i-beginners-phrases-and-acronyms-in-lol?show=flat","replies":[{"poster":"TheHobbits","date":"2014-11-11T21:42:33.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still don't know how to embed a picture into the thread.","replies":[{"poster":"Declined","date":"2014-11-11T22:09:37.851+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You upload the image onto a hosting website, and then take the direct link to the picture and post the link.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Sweet","date":"2014-11-12T20:39:39.065+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Declined,\n\nAppreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts. Going to attempt to address each as I am able. \n\n* **Character Limit**: We're going to be playing around with increasing the character limit on both comments and discussions. No ETA when but it should be implemented relatively soon. \n* **Chrono View & Discussion View**: We are working on streamlining both types of comment views. This will include a better quoting system amongst other clarity items. \n* **Post Limitations**: Not 100% sure what you're saying here, sounds like it may be referencing attachments.

Character limits are significantly decreased in posts compared to the OP.\n2. **Pictures** Although I've used the exact same method to post the pictures, for some reason they're only displayed correctly in the OP, judging by this I can postulate that the hardcoded rules and limitation are different for the OP compared to any of the following posts.\n3. There are probably more, but those are the ones I've come across.\n\nIf I could somehow use the 'embedding' or attachment option, I may be able to solve it through that method, unfortunately having scoured the boards I've yet to come across anywhere it has been used, so I can assimilate the method and use it henceforth.\nAs an example I've attached the first banner, but I have no clue what to do after uploading.\n\nEdit: I must admit it also looks strange, and may not even be a solution I can work with.\nI've also worked with these symbols in my guide when creating the lists more suited to my taste -, *, ○, •, ►, ◄, ▲, ▼","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pastramka","date":"2014-11-11T21:35:54.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any suggestions of a good forum/boards?","replies":[{"poster":"Declined","date":"2014-11-11T22:19:39.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have plenty, and when I transferred it onto boards, I was under the impression these were already implemented, having talked to support I am now more acutely aware of these problems and was 'suggested' leaving a comment here, which is what this thread is about.\n\nBut if you want specifics, I would want the option to increase the limit, and remove image restriction from individual posts, however given the layout and the OP being present in chronological view, that may have to be disabled in exceedingly large posts.\n\nI would also like some standards regarding ASCII symbols as well, as I had to  improvise my formatting options in order to better create lists that suited my needs.","replies":[]}]}]}
