The next thing I know, I'm redirected to post game lobby showing my champ with an X for leaver remake when the client never even started the game. Then leaverbuster  ban all because the client never actually lands me in game. I've tried logging into a normal queue and now I freaking get a 5 game afk leavebuster warning when I haven't done anything and the client has glitched for more than 3 games in a row. Please fix this or atleast remove the ban since this is simply unacceptable and really frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-11-13T05:42:26.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Catalina update broke it, reportedly. your only option is to use a less crap OS that has some respect for standardization.","replies":[]}]}
