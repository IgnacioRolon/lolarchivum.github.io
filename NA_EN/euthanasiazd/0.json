It's the account itself that has been banned. [**Account sharing is not allowed**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204214670) since you can start an account of your own for free, so you are responsible for everything your account does. I'd encourage your friend to start his own account, that way you won't need to be held responsible for anything they do.","replies":[]}]}
