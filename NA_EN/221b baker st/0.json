Suddenly I got disconnected with the \"attempting to reconnect message\" but when I pressed \"quit game\", some how I immediately ended back to the client page and still could start a new game. There was no indication that I was ever in a game in the beginning (no match history, no lp lost gain ). Any thoughts guys?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-30T03:00:21.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like the gameserver your match was being hosted on may have encountered a hiccup.
