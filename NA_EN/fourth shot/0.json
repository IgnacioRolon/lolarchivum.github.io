You simply have a chance to earn a key fragment if you win a match (does not require an S).  Once you earn a key, your chances of earning another one lower dramatically, so it may take some time to earn key fragments!\n\nChests however are earned through earning a S rank.  However, there are some conditions that apply to this.  You can read all of the requirements to earn a chest in our [Hextech Crafting Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233).\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions!","replies":[]}]}
