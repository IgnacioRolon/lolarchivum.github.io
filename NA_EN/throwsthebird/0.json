My current soloQ ranked MMR is 1751 which tranlates to Gold 3. (according to OP.GG)\n\nMy elo is Bronze 4 (op.gg says I will skip divisions?) and I have a 67% win rate...really nothing special at this elo. However now to reach Bronze 3 I am placed in matches where the enemy has 1886 MMR on average (rammus - sion game), against players who were platinum last season. \n\nAm I correct in assuming that because of my relatively high MMR (compared to the actual elo) the system will group me with lower MMR players just to average out the team MMR? In other words am I correct in assuming that the system is actively trying to hinder my climb and push me towards a 50% win rate? Is the matchmaking working against the player? \n\nI'm quite new to this mmr / elo system so any info you can give me is much appreciated. Thank you.

Back in season 1, when I was bronze. see icon.\n\nOh Elo hell exists. But it's not because of some pre-ordained calculation by Riot. It's because the impact of one in 10 players is generally too small to impact the outcome of a game where the other 4 players on your team have a 50/50 chance of being the feeder, feeding earlier, snowballing earlier, and as a consequence, it takes 3-10 times as many games to climb a tier than it would if you were in your same ranged players. At some point the fact climbing is just \"dampened\" by the people you play with and how early they introduce gold into the games..... becomes an elo hell. \n\nThere are also very few champs in the game who can truly take advantage of this early game phenomenon and turn it into a quick game. When one stands out, they generally get nerfed. Or, they are exclusive to one unique one trick play style, like {{champion:55}} . Someone who moves around so quickly it's hard to target skill them, they can avoid 50% of your skill shots, and reset their abilities, and have no costs. You literally have to play 150-200 games against a current Katarina to learn how to predict/outplay her enough to consider her a normal champion. And even then, you tend to forget some nuances, and the fact different people play her differently.\n\nPoint is...... if you are tied to specific champions you like, which aren't one of the meta hyper carries who can 1v5 a game, and you are in a low elo of people who are 50/50, then yes. Elo Hell Does Exist. But it's because of the general fact that people haven't learned: The early game is the largest deciding factor on a win. Not because of matchmaking. CS, First Bloods, Quadra kill counter-invasions.... That's elo hell.","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2019-01-15T21:08:28.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Eh.

Maybe I should not play ranked then...if the system just wants to fuck you in the ass what&#x27;s the point? :(\n\nThat's NOT quite how ranked works (It's just how players often feel it works)\n\n1) If you go on winning streaks in ranked, you will be placed ever escalating with mmrs much higher than your own rank (Suppose you earn 20 LP a win, but still have to endure promotion series; those promotion series are still increasing your effective MMR, but aren't increasing your rank. In other words, you very well could be Bronze III and be put into Silver III games, if you've had a streak of consecutive wins.)\n\nAs a result, players often feel like the system is stepping on them, because their effective real skill level might be Bronze I or Silver IV, and their games are placing them with players who are better (Silver III) than their current rank (Bronze III), and better than their current skill level, but doing so increases the likelihood of losses.\n\nBecause the system calculates streaks as effective rank displacement, it often seems the best way to rank is to just win 2, and then lose 1, to keep the system from escalating the mmr of your teammates and opponents.\n\n2) What he said about New accounts ranking faster is half true. \n\nIn reality, New accounts both fall AND climb in ranks faster. This is because LP rewards/losses take into consideration your Win/Loss Ratio, and 1 game affects this far more when you are at 10 games than 1000 games. If you are skillful enough to maintain a 65% win rate at 1000 games, you can technically climb just as fast as a 65% at 10 games, but 1000 games is far harder to maintain, especially if you gamble on a new champ or something, and lose 10-15 games in a row, ranking your ratios. It's far more likely that at a low sample size, you pull off 65%, while at 1000 games you might be 53%. Or, instead of 53% (Positive) You very likely could fall to 48%, because the irregular play you get stuck with in low elos after you have that one less streak further exacerbates the issue, and every game becomes a 1v5, as your 4 teammates feed.\n\nI'm not trying to say that will happen with everybody; I'm just saying..... up to a point the ability to climb/fall is sheer luck. Skill only accounts for about a 3-4% margin in your rate of success. But that 3-4% matters. It's the difference between winning 21 LP/losing 17 LP, and Winning 18 LP, and losing 20 LP.\n\n3) Old accounts have an opportunity to semi-renew themselves every season. Even if one year you end in the gutter, and your next season will start off at a reasonably low rank, there IS hope:\n\n-Every season, you start off at 0 games. So although you have had 1000s of games weigh you down, and gotten nowhere in Season 8, you very well may be able to climb in season 9, because the LP gains/losses have reset. So if you get that 65% win rate right off the bat, and maintain it, you're going to climb like a new account. If you lose that 65%, and drop down to 50%, you'll experience what GFreemen suggested: Normal LP gains/Losses which often tread water.\n\n-------------------\n\nSo go at a Season start intelligently:\n\n-Be aware that right after a season starts, the trolls/booster accounts are still out in droves, trying to either place/not care about placing because they have an opinion it won't matter (when someone is a Silver IV or Bronze, often they have the mindset their outcome in placements do not matter, so they just wiff and throw 10 games in a row just to get to games with actual LP/Loss/gains), So I highly suggest waiting a few weeks.\n\n-Go hard on champions you dominate with. Don't deviate and try to play something exciting or fun, until much later.\n\n-If you have reliable friends who consistently perform better than your elo, play your placements/early games with them. This will preserve your honor by keeping you out of chat, and it will hedge your ability to control your game, rather than leaving it in the hands of 4 strangers.\n\nI hope this helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2019-01-13T10:35:09.383+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey throw. I strongly disagree with Gfreemen. Let me explain some relevant information about MMR systems.\n\nSo here's what you need to know.\n\n1) MMR and Team Elo systems work. They are statistical systems. The use law of large numbers to shift out RNG of teammates. Its provably workable, they are mathematically and in practice systems that achieve their end goals. Note that this goal is to sort the player base across the ladder by skill. Weak players sink. Strong ones climb.   This is not the starting point but the end result it try's to achieve.  You can expect roughly 50% of the games players to sink in Elo and MMR.  About half of them will be below the base mmr value all accounts enter into the ranked ladder with. Soft resets and inactive accounts do change this somewhat but its a pretty solid rule of thumb. They do not check how well your playing, its not judging you on each play or your stats. Did you win or lose is core to adjusting. Some games do stat track. But even then the core is still. Did you win or lose?  The stat tracking can effectively be viewed as a modification to K factor and only impacts how much extra mmr you got or lose.   K factor is something I will talk about more on, going to be in point 3.\n\n2)  Its going to be inaccurate. Often. Very often. Again new accounts have the same start point and that's not bottom of the ladder. The absolutely worst RNG is going to be MMR tiers near starting value of new accounts. But there is no reason to ever assume its rigged or that your unfavored. Its just inherently more chaotic here. If your in a situation where, \"I only lose if my teammates are bad and/or enemy team has strong player.\"  and at the same time also feel  \"I only win if teammates are good and/or enemy team is feeders\" your admiting that you make very little personal impact. At this point you  rely on the RNG to climb or fall.  So it sucks for a lot of folks but the majority of the player base is going to operate in the MMR that's the absolutely most chaotic and by virtue of Percentiles. So just know if that's actually representative of their average skill they will get stuck. They will feel helpless. Its not rigged the system literally does not give a shit about you ever. Its not trying to be nice to you. It just doesn't care. Your good? Climb.  If not to bad.Its job is to sepreate who can climb, who cant, and those that are heavy like rocks and sink.\n\nLook, I have a lot of sympathy for people near the starting mmr. Its rough. But ultimately the system does favor you once you improve so focus entirely on your own play and it will get better.  I'm using my Season 1 bronzie icon for a reason. Once I honestly and whole heartedly believed in elo hell for about 1 and 1/2 year.  Now I don't, I just cant in face of how easy it is to climb smurfing.  If you want, I can give you a way to test mmr with dice, But the much easier way Is to look at when you first started playing. Compare it to the you now. And ask, if I had a 5 man team of current me vs 5 man team vs first game me. Who would I expect to win a majority of matches?  Traditionally this  impossible to create but easy to build on paper hypothetical question is all you need to show yourself that skill impacts win rates.\n\n3) Inaccuracy is accounted for. Mismatches, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR.  No joke. K factor is a term in elo. its used to represent uncertainty. Its part of the adjustment formula.  At the end of a game the variables for adjustment are plugged in and that's what your new mmr is going to be.  it usually looks like some variation of this.  New mmr = Old mmr + K (Result of match - System Expectations for match).  This adjustment is ran and tracked individually by player.  \n\nK factor. Less games higher it is. So, a lot of devs add extra mods to it, Dota 2 and OW/Heros of the storm. Honestly I expect riot has several of their own that they just don't mention.  For the most part I recommend that players just ignore it, it wont change the adjustments core function of tracking wins/losses. I will talk about why one has to do this in a 3A) point in a moment here.\n So regardless of modifications you can have a very basic understanding of Elo and MMR. If I win I get mmr. If I lose I lose mmr. Placement matches have very high K factors. You can go far up or down ladder during them.   But, in many games in addition to having the K factor lower over time. WIll have Choke points where it lowers off ladder position.  That way a Awfull player with good luck wont end up in say masters. The needed # of wins goes up because their MMR gains lower at set points where you need to see slowdown. Same for the reverse, you set slow downs in lower mmr so a good player with bad luck for a few early games wont get buried in the bottom of iron.\n\nThe adjustment (results - expectaitons) is because not ever game is going to be fair. The system will have matches it assumes a team is favored. It then changes the adjusments. unfavored teams gain More MMR on a win, the lose less on a loss. Because that's exactly what the system expects. Vice versa, if your favored you stand to gain less mmr on a win, lose more for a loss.  This with variance of K factor means that when you get dicked with a unranked player. Odds are they will lose the most MMR by virtue of an exaggerated K factor.  You only see unranked players in a set range of the ranked ladder. Hence why I have sympathy for the average player. Lower and higher on the ladder they are  non existent.\n\nSo ultimately even if you maintain a 50% win rate, you could climb providing a majority of your games your team is unfavored. You stand to Gain MMR. You could also Fall if your on a favored team majority of games. Regardless, If you maintain a Positive Win rate, you will be climbing.\n\n3A) The issue with a Judge rateing.  Skill gaps are a thing. In chess there is a 2 move checkmate that only happens if white makes the very worst moves. Winning in 2 moves is statistically very good, but its only archivable if the gap in skill between white and black is massive.  in MMR biased matchmaking the assumption is there are going to be unfair games. Stomping folks below your level doesn't prove your a Pro or Top tier player. Just that you can abuse folks much weaker then you.  I can destroy my roommates in SSBU with robin and 3 to 0 them stock matches. **I will never win a pro tournament**.  My kda might be much higher then a pro but that's not because I am better then a pro. Its just that my oppositions just to weak to even KO me once.\n\nTrying to measure by stats off opposition, when you don't have a good grasp on the skill gap is pointless.  Literally the end goal of  Elo/MMR systems are trying to find skill for players.\n\n4) What ever you think Riot would gain by a \"Rigged\" matchmaker? Literally its easier to just tweak a functional Elo and MMR system.  You can super easily \"hard stuck\" a majority of your players at any MMR you want. Give them a Garbage low K factor or only have the Adjustment value be a super low #.  You can set it to take an expectation of 400+ games for a functional MMR system to get accurate.\n\nTo say it rigs games. Implies l that it knows what champions will be played and how well each player will play them. Its well known  that different champion interactions affect a match. Hard counters, soft counters. weak team comp, good team comps. How does it know in advanced?\n\nHow does riot know some one might lose power or afk then decide oh player X needs a loss. Lets give them this afker?  Also why bother?  Ranked ladder is percentile biased. You can keep majority of folks in your ladder where ever you want. ESPECIALLY WITH RIOTS LEAUGE SYSTEM.\n\nLike I can set my starting mmr to be in bronze and that means that roughly 50% of the games players are only going to be in iron and bronze. Only a small % of players make It up.  Throw in a lot of K factor slowdowns or just have it be absolutely tiny gains for any MMR outside of bronze? Kudos almost no ones even making it up to high gold or plat.\nAnd lets be real, riot literally has Force outs in their ladder. There is only 200 slots in challenger. No matter what It can only account for a small fraction of the games entire population.\n\nSo people will say shit like OMG forced win rates. Or RIOT FORCES 50% BECUASE X.  But that's just bullshit. Rigged matchmaking is hard. Not giving a f**k if you put mismatches into games is easy for mmr and it wont stop it from working.  You can easily make it a nightmare to climb and still have a \"fair\" matchmaker.\n\n\"Forced Win rates\" Completely f**ks the systems ability to rate players. If it cant get a good judgment on skill and all players of every skill are in the same MMR it uses to build games. Then it is even harder for a forced matchmaker to work. Unless it literally predicts the future.\n\nSadly its a popular excuse. Because again about 50% of the games gonna be only falling down the ladder. Average players have the highest % of mismatched games due to it being the start point to build a percentile ladder. You see the most mismatches at the expected standard level of play. Just a inherent part of the game.But remember, at no point does the ladder care. Your job as a player is to see how high you can go. The job of the ladder is to prevent weak players from making it to the top.Its impossible to keep strong players out of the bottom. Its a lot easier to intentionally lose then it is to win. Its possible to keep weak players from making it to the top tiers of play.\n\n5) League system is more then just Team elo and MMR. And hell yes it has some flaws. Just nothing that will hadycapy good players from climbing.\n\nNow despite this long ass post defending and calling out blatant lies and misunderstandings of Elo and MMR. Let me give you an example of a inherently flawed part of the system. Riots needs to address duoing. A basic understanding of Elo and MMR is all you need to have beef with duoing. Because Is not biased off mmr but  league tiers and that upsets me. It makes for higher mismatches.  It should be off the same Gap of what matchmaker considers its bottom line for a reasonable game.  \n\nAnyhow Let me know if there's anything about Elo or MMR you have some questions on.","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2019-01-13T11:39:41.825+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wall of Text post, but I'm going to attempt to counter point a bit:\n\n1) isn't entirely applicable, because there are two systems in play when calculating effective player status: Stock reading ranking (Their actual rank) and Flow reading ranking (What the MMR system suggests they should be playing against)\n\nLarge Sample laws would be appropriate if you only had one measure of success, instead of two. If you are a Silver IV player who is at a Flow reading ranking of Gold IV, it's very likely you are both getting exposed to players far beyond your skill, and that while your teammates might be that rank, you're not, and your play reflects it, and it ALSO affects the play proficiency of your teammates. If a Silver IV is in a game with Gold IV's it's very likely that:\n\nThe Gold IV's have an effective MMR of Silver I, after a series of losses.\nThe Gold IV's still have a Gold IV proficiency of play.\nThe teammates of the Silver IV will behave like a Silver II, because they don't know how to manage their lame duck player.\n\n---------------\n\nIf instead, Silver IV meant you played against Silver IV players, then yes. Large sample laws would dictate correct. But, since the reality is Silver IV vs Gold IV, you are wrong.\n\n2) Your argument is valid, BUT there's a very big problem with the very beginning of what you said: New accounts do NOT (unless season 9 changes this) start out at the same exact MMR. In Season 1-8, your placements on a new account have literally taken into account your Normal Summoner Rift record to calculate an approximate MMR to begin your placements at. That is how some new accounts started in Bronze while others start in Gold III. And because the Normal MMR was imposed when placing new accounts everything you said following does NOT apply. The spread of new accounts was (probably still is) random enough between 11-12 ranks that they won't all be in one cluster, offering a fair chance of outcome. \n\n3) They may adjust based on uncertainty, but a 1-2 LP adjustment isn't as significant as the impact to whom you are going to be playing your subsequent games with. The fact we have promotional series heavily impacts both positive and negative K factors. The stock value of the rank remains unchanged at these barriers, while the K factor of the win/loss doesn't. If you are Bronze I, 0 LP, and lose Three games, your K factor adjusts your teams to Bronze III. This invariably leads to an ineffiency in the K factor. Likewise, if you are Silver I and win 3 games in your promotion, you are going to effectively be a Gold IV with a K factor set at Gold III or II, also leading to an inefficiency. These inefficiencies are creating lag in positive performance and an acceleration of negative performance. The fact that the two are creating polarized results cannot be ignored.\n\n3A) My counter is similar to 3) Incrementalism supports skill improvement. MMR based on K Factor doesn't. It skips increments and places you directly outside your skill level.\n\n4) The premise of this point is correct. However, there is one factor that Riot has actually ADMITTED to set the outcome against your skill level: Promotional Series. Riot has actually admitted, that the reason you generally see adversarial performances at promotional series, is because they want to verify that you are ready for the players you will be facing. In other words:\n\nThey DO intervene and give you non MMR rated teams when organizing a match with someone who is in a promotion. The K Factor in a promotional series is voided to some extent, and replaced with a protocol that makes you compete above that point.","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2019-01-13T22:40:37.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I thank you for takeing the time to respond in depth. I truly appreciate seeing well reasoned comments.\n\n> because there are two systems in play when calculating effective player status: Stock reading ranking (Their actual rank) and Flow reading ranking (What the MMR system suggests they should be playing against\n\nI would like to point out to the matchmaking system that the only thing it care for is the Flow reading rank. Stock rank as you call it is entirely for players. It makes no impact on how matches are built. Which is frustrating for some players who don't understand how the \"Flow reading (henceforth referred to as MMR)\" works.   There are 2 occasions Stock rank is considered in game. At the end of a season for season rewards. #2 is for Duoing limitations which **I strongly disagree with riot on**I feel it should be restricted by MMR not the player distraction tiers. Who knows, possibly im wrong and they do/did restrict to large of a mmr gap but seeing a gold division 5 play with plat division 1 seems like a pretty gnarly gap to me. Because with MMR gap between assigned skill that could be the same as a silver player MMR Qued with a Diamond Player MMR.\n\nUltimately for the MMR system it only cares about MMR. The league systems to make folks feel better about losing games, give riot some extra tools for controlling the ladder. its not related to the quality of a match, outside of Duoing. Depending on the # of active players the effective MMR range of Divisions changes, its honestly inconsistent for judging player skill.\n\n> If you are a Silver IV player who is at a Flow reading ranking of Gold IV\n\nI assume we are talking about \"true skill\" when you say Silver IV here?  It should be pretty uncommon to see such a large gap in true skill to assigned skill. Now I can think of ways in league that it can exist. An example is if a OTP get their main nerfed/reworked and will now underperform. \n\nStill the matches your describing entirely function to make large #s work.  The Silver player is placed higher then their skill so that is a handicap for his team. So he will experience losses and that lowers his MMR. This happens in literally every game he is in until he has lost enough MMR that the system is placing him in a range he wont cripple teams. Now this seems unfair for his teamamtes but remember that His Gold teammates with a lame duck only had him 1 game. Their next match the odds of a \"lame duck\" increase to be on the enemy team rather then their team so their unfortunate loss from a weak player is compensated if they just play more. MMR systems will always favor a good player who is underplaced and harm a weak one who is over placed.\nBecause matchmaker wont care what division you are. Just what MMR range your in.\n\nNow Ideally you don't want your system to create this large of a gap. The MMR adjustment  gap your discussing here truly feels a bit high.  You get dramatic rubber banding, players don't like that.  I suppose at the very start it might be realistic for an account to see this, but i'd call it a pretty weak matchmaker if it was a common place event rather then exception.\n\nNow\n> 2) Your argument is valid, BUT there's a very big problem with the very beginning of what you said: New accounts do NOT (unless season 9 changes this) start out at the same exact MMR. In Season 1-8, your placements on a new account have literally taken into account your Normal Summoner Rift record\n\nI think you may have the wrong information.\n[Everyone’s MMR starts at the same point when playing a queue for the first time.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide)\n[MMRs between queues aren’t connected. This means occasionally high-MMR ranked players have lower MMRs in normals. ](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2018/02/dev-matchmaking-real-talk/)\nEven back in 2009 it seems like the Ques are not related. [If you solo queued, its just your personal rating (i.e. ranked team rating for ranked team, normal games rating for normal games)](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=12029)\n\nFar as I have seen only the opposite is true where riots considered using Ranked to splash into normal. [We’re looking into some options, such as having better algorithms to get players to more accurate MMRs in a shorter time, or potentially “splashing” small amounts of MMR from ranked into normals without a direct link between the two](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2018/02/dev-matchmaking-real-talk/)\n\n\n3) K factor adjustment is exclusively for MMR. MMR gap to assigned Division is what then influence LP. K factor is not directly related to LP gains or losses as You can have low K factor and a high MMR gap for your division to mmr and see big LP changes.  There's no direct correlation between K factor and LP gains/losses. There Is no negative or positive K factor. Its Higher and lower. It represents account uncertainty. You see it change over # of games played and at MMR milestones where you don't want accounts to travel to far because of luck. Again Divisions are not Tied to MMR so they are unrelated to milestones. Instead its the milestones that will affect the % of players who can get to divisions because it slows down the rate of travel on a ladder making it so luck has lower impact on the ability to climb or fall to far.\n\nYou don't build teams off K factor. Matchmaker does this. Its set to have rules when searching for games. There's a range of MMR it considers fair to build a team from when you que up. Now MMR is built using the K factor but that's only 1 variable in the adjustment formula.  If we want to try and make more \"fair matches\" using player experience? Its better to have matchmaker search to matching the # of games played on accounts then it by trying to find matching K factors.  Because your going to have slowdowns off MMR tiers to prevent lucky climbing and there is a hard cap for high and lowest K factor values.  Depending on where riot puts this a Player with 50 games could have the same K factor as one with 300.\n\n\"The fact we have promotional series heavily impacts both positive and negative K factors.\"\nK factor does not impact \"Stock Flow\"  Just MMR. Promotional series don't affect mmr gains and losses. Theres no Positive or negative K factors with out extra modifications to your MMR system. And you can make that happen as a dev if you wanted to artificially add difficulty to climbing.  On its own thou, there's good reason to do so.  High and low uncertainty is all K factor should care about.  You want to move accounts to the level they play at quicker with high uncertainty so theres less negative impact on the majority of your player base where on paper fair matches are a blatantly lop sided snowball messes because of mismatched players.\n\n> you are going to effectively be a Gold IV with a K factor set at Gold III\nYou don't ever see this. K factor changes are going to be off a set MMR value because that's a consistent number that you can rely on for a matchmaker. Gold III will represent a changing range of MMR averages over a season. If a bunch of new players start playing ranked and are absolutely newbies. They will lose a lot of games, they change the average MMR for the game to be higher. So your mmr values by tier all go up in everything above where the newbies sink to. Theres more MMR in the system.  \n\nOne of the reasons soft resets happen is to bleed out extra MMR. It removes inactive accounts. It resets uncertainty. It sucks out some of the bloated MMR at the end of a season from all the accounts that stopped playing. Also, again soft resets are a place where riot can minipulate their ranked ladder to reflect what ever they want. but they can also at any point change starting place for new accounts in any given season if the chose as well. So forced 50% remains a BS argument.\n\n> They DO intervene and give you non MMR rated teams when organizing a match with someone who is in a promotion. \nNot exactly. Just how the system functions. MMR gains > Lp gains. So if your climbing your MMR goes up faster then your \"stock flow\" Your matched vs higher players because you have MMR there. Bigger the gap the harder the promo. \n**Your correct that Promotional games are designed to make people prove they belong in an MMR**. The belief that this is because it ignores MMR to build the games as far as I can tell is wrong. Feel free to correct me with a source if you have one. If you don't, then we are just seeing exactly what you should expect from Leauge and MMR, not riot loading games. Just a natural flow of events.\n\nBit repetitive but lets look at it some more.\n\nIf your win rates positive but at low % it will take a longer time to climb. You wont see a dramatic gap between your MMR and Division so when you finally get to a promotional game your going to be vs players at a lower MMR value.  flip side, If your hot streaking and killing it with a very high win % your MMR is going to be much higher then your \"stock flow\" so you have to compete vs higher Players.  \n\nLets say some one blazed it up the ladder and now is struggling in promos. They are Losing over and over and over in promos but consistently making it back to them. It will lower the gap between MMR and your current division until your promo games place you vs people actually at your level. In lower Elo there is promo helper. So you just need 1 out of 2 games to be a win. Or 2 out of 4.\nAlso if your MMR gets super bloated you will skip divisions, the system plays catch up.\nits not set to harm good players or under placed accounts.   K factor will get lower at some point, MMR gains/losses will become less dramatic. LP Gains and losses will get closer to a natural point. The opposition gets weaker.\n\nI have never seen any Claims from Riot that they ignore MMR to build promotional matches.  Far as I can tell there's absolutely no evidence that it interferes with MMR systems end goals. Weak sinks. Strong Rises. Normal Flounders.\n\nTldr for this is Riot  is correct to say its more challenging for players. Its not because its rigged or ignores the rules. Just a inherent interaction of MMR with the League system that is intended.","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2019-01-13T23:57:08.522+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) Promotions also take into account Stock ranking. And that's my biggest rubbing point. When you win 5-7 games in succession to get to a Promotion, it dramatically changes your MMR. It puts you about 2-3 tiers above the rank you are attempting to promote out of. You're better off getting to a promotional game by winning 2, losing 1, winning 2, losing one, etc, just to artificially keep your MMR lower so that when the promotion comes, you are placed with moderately weaker players. \n\n2) 5 ranks difference probably is rare, but 3 is pretty common. If you go on a 10 game winning streak MMR calculations can easily place you 2-3 tiers up. If your LP adjusted by K is substantial, and gaining 23-24 LP/Win, the difference can go even higher.\n\nI had an example of an extreme MMR drop that I often use. When Evelynn was reworked, I had a 69% Win rate Sona account. I used to play the old Evelynn as AD/hybrid. So, It was late Season, I thought I was safe in Gold IV, so I picked up Evelynn to experiment with her new mechanics on the Season 7 Runes. Evelynn couldn't survive a Baron, and could barely survive a drake in Season 7 end. Also, boosters were out (one claimed to be a rank 68 Challenger Zed smurfing), and it wasn't the right time to pull her out. Although I generally performed well in every game, the boosters/people who do not know how to react/play to them, just destroyed my ability to carry with her in that state. \n\nI lost like 23 of 26 games (something like that). I had a 14% win rate with the new Evelynn.\n\nThe losses weren't entirely consecutive, but.....the result was: By the time I dropped to 0 LP Gold V, my effective MMR was Silver III. Aparrently my just having lost Gold IV didn't give me a 3 game demotion protection at Gold V, because one loss, and I literally demoted to Silver I. After that, I just began Fing around, because they released a Galio 1 shot patch, nerfed Sona, and my per win LP had dropped from 23 to 14.\n\nOn this smurf, I did the same thing with Neeko, although the losses were more of a gradual fall, and dropped out of Silver I to about Bronze II (partially due to people I was duoing; I saw a few people perform really well for a game, so I decided to carry them a little closer to gold at EoS. Turned out only 2 were even competent, and began sloppily feeding level 1-2 every game, and having enough bad games to destroy my opportunity of ever carrying them. Even though I was coaching them on the new voice app...... they still fed hard.... along with the rest of the team. I'd have 3.8 KDAs or better, and my team would have .2 KDA. That bad. That dropped me down to about Silver V. Then I started soloing again because I didn't trust these guys, and Silver V isn't any better than Bronze, so I did dip down into Bronze for awhile to consecutive 1v5's. I'm slowly getting back out to my friends, but euh. It takes almost three times as many games as Gold/Plat)\n\nBut anywho...... When I got into a Promo for Bronze I from Bronze II, my MMR was clear up at Silver III. When I was up for a Promo back into Silver IV, my MMR was Silver III. So yeah. The gap can get considerable.\n\n2) The post was updated recently. So again, I don't know if it continues to be the way it was.\nBut no..... I've had 5 different accounts. My Season 4 account started Bronze I. My Season 5 account 1 Started Gold V and Second account started Silver II. My Season 7 account started Gold IV. There is an incredible variance in the old system. Furthermore, the Silvers were actually more successful at \"winning\" my promotions than the Golds were. I had 10/10 on the Silvers. I had 6/10 on the Gold V and 7/10 on the Gold IV.\n\nI've talked to enough pros and pro smurfs to know that when they make an account, they try to get the highest win rate possible on their Norms leveling, because it does (did) affect their preliminary Queues. And I believe it. My Gold starting accounts had 67+% Win rates going into Ranked. The Silver account was 53%, and the Bronze account was 49%. I know we're not discussing personal performance as evidence, but that's mine, and smurf's accounting of the situation.\n\nThe chat you linked answered a question about dynamic MMR synergies between normals and ranked, not specifically about a starting point. Yes, they do run separately after your starting point.\n\n3) Promotional Series DO affect MMR, both in Stock and in Flow. The evidence is in how far you fall when you fail a promotional Series. If you lose 2, you will drop to ~ 67 LP. When you lose 1, win one, lose 1, you will only drop to about 75-78 LP. That's evidence that either a passive movement to LP exists, or MMR is moving. Furthermore, MMR tracking websites and correlating teams ALSO tend to emulate the responses to your performance. Game 1 of a Promotional Series may have 1450 MMR, and the teams will reflect that, with them averaging around that. If you win, the MMR average witnessed tends to jump 20-28 points. If you lose, the MMR average tends to drop 20-25 points. \n\n(Even if the websites generally are not correct calculating MMR, they are moving when you lose a promotional series game)\n\n4) When I get a chance I might try to find it. I believe I was the one who actually got a Rioter to admit it. But it's buried in thousands of posts and I don't know the right keywords.....","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2019-01-15T22:08:26.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) Yea but the trade off is you can have a more dramatic MMR adjustment to move the very weak and very strong accounts out of MMR brackets more rapidly with out some one hitting a league they don't actualy belong in with out the ability to back it up.\nPros and cons to running it like that.  Rubberbandings one of the cons of a higher adjustment/ larger K factors.\n\nFar as bleeding MMR from your account, I find its much simpler to abuse Duo Que for that. You can force matchmaker to have uneven teams with duoing and that will change how it builds \"fair\" matches.  Just need the gap between your and your friends mmr to be large as possible.  Way easier then trying to maintain a 66% win rate.  Also it allows you to keep playing to win, your hommie might be enough to cost you a game because they are weaker players and that's a shame. but you can coach them, give them a taste of what level they need to play at, bleed away MMR from your account, And not see dramatic slide down the ladder. \n\nDuo needs to be set off MMR ranges. Riot is doing a bit better then they used to be about duoing but its defiantly a place to exploit their system.  Or I am wrong and its not.  Feel like it is so I tend to use it this way. Take it as an opinion I guess.  \n\nI have tanked MMR 1 season helping a friend and ended up starting next season in silver. Was pretty fun for me as it was basically smurfing on my main account. Ended up skipping divisions.\n\n2) Lp Gains are reflected by MMR gap between assigned League and assigned mmr. They are mostly unrelated to K factors. A high K factor will make a more dramatic gap between MMR and league. But the LP gains are consistent regardless of an accounts # of games. you don't see them diminished over time because of K.\n\nHeads up, game demotion protection far as I know only applys after winning a promotion. Riot used to hand out warnings to folks who fall a full tier (gold V vs Silver V)  no idea if they still do that thou.  Just don't count on demotion protection apart from a few matches after a promo win.\n\nSounds like when you put your nose to the grindstone to fix your MMR you did?  It got a nasty gap and all but eventually your gonna skip divisions.  and if your already able to beat the folks at the MMR your matched with, no reason that having a lower tier harms you with high MMR. Its only an issue when you hit a wall.\n\nA lot of folks forget that MMR is representing a range of expected play. That folks will have good and bad games. So its got wiggle room and is usually represented with a curve.\n\n2B (you repeated a number, sall good.)  https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide  \"Everyone’s MMR starts at the same point when playing a queue for the first time.\"  This is consistent for mmr systems. It also gives the devs more control over percentiles of a ranked ladder. Its easier to calculate expectations for how the player base gets distributed.\n\nYou do see fresh accounts go the exact same win% in placements and end up at different mmrs. You can even see the exact same pattern result in different placement.  Because not every match has the same expectations. The range of MMR change per account will be fairly RNG. K factors at its expected highest point. Any wins when unfavored = Max MMR gain. \n\nso I am more inclined to think that its related to placement win % then normal MMR splashing over. Its an extra step to splash and doesn't really help riot or the players any. Just opens up abuse cases.\n\nThere is better ways to accelerate players around the ladder, even with RNG. Far as i can tell, Splashing makes it harder to have a reliable model of player distribution around the CenterPoint/starting point, and doesn't inherently create better matches.\n\n3) This is entirely my fault. I was unclear. What I wanted to convey was MMR works the same regardless of promotional matches. What I said was \"Promotional series don't affect mmr gains and losses. \"  \n\nI see how that can be unclear. \n\nYes. You still will gain and lose MMR during Promotional series. The lack of LP change is irrelevant. Your going up or down every match, even promotionals.  I did not covey this very well and I see how you can take it as me saying that your MMR freezes.\n\n> That's evidence that either a passive movement to LP exists, or MMR is moving\nMMR is defiantly moving.  You can actually make a higher MMR gap if you keep losing promos to luck. I have done it. Unreliable internet = lobby dodges = free loss with 0 mmr impact.  \n\nRepeated losses then returns will act the opposite. It lowers your mmr. because your Lp gains higher if your MMR is higher so you only need 1-2 games to return. Then if you flop it over and over even with promo helper your win % suffers. MMR can start to drain out, because mmr changes are more dramatic.\n\nIt can be grindy but end of the day you can overcome promotional matches.  Also,I think Duoing is still the best way to bleed MMR. I don't have riots # so that's very much an opinion of mine and not a fact.\n\nHonestly I always wanted to make a bronze 5 smurf and keep it as long as I can in bronze by que dodging in promo games.

I shouldn't have to show the system that I belong into G5 against people in mid to high gold. \n\nPromo series' need a new system where you play against people at max 2 ranks above the rank you are at atm aka people with an MMR similar to the rank you'd have after promoting.\n\nHell I don't mind playing against plat in my default ranked games but keep them out of my promo series if the rank I'm trying to get is half a tier below them.","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2019-01-13T20:38:30.967+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"No they don't.

Your honestly not wrong here for the functionality. That being said, All it takes if riot shifted back to say Team ELO is to lower their Adjustments per match and it will be just as grindy as the current league system, but with a higher Range of mismatches near starting MMR because accounts wont flow as rapidly up and down in MMR ranges.\n\nIts pretty clear that Players get fooled by the shiny icons and divisions, they play more games. They don't feel as bad about it. Reasonably it should be expected that if you cant win when placed vs players at a higher MMR you don't belong there. You shouldn't hit the mark then be allowed to quit if your actively a handicap to your team. Hell there is a reason so many other games adapted it to their systems.\n\nYou are right, some folks will lose out on season rewards. Many players wont have a Division that is truly accurate to their skill, but a good # of folks wont put in the min required # of games to sort out RNG inherent with the game.\n\nIf your consistently playing at a higher level then your assigned MMR your still going to climb even with promotional games.  If your playing weaker then your assigned MMR you should be losing because your a handicap for your team.\n\nEventually the MMR Gap will lower, fail a promotion enough times and the difficulty goes down.  Some players do lose out, but I don't see any reason the system should care about them.  \n\nIf you had the required # of games you'd have the ranking. If you don't that's a shame but its not really a positive to give high uncertainty accounts rewards they don't clearly prove they can earn.\n\nRiots # last time they gave one was about 150 to 300 matches for their system to accurately place you at your skill. \n\nOnce you hit season rewards, once you make it out of the starting range for soft resets. it is easier to achieve them next year.  Proving it once and keeping that level of skill is enough. soft resets go off MMR if your willing to trust Riot on this.

When your the weakest member on a team is the game trying to punish your teammates by putting you in the match? Do you think your skill at the game is so consistant that it can accurately predict what champion your going to run in a match and how well your going to play it?\n\nLike lets look at that Vayne game. 5-6-6. Sona got cheesed for FB in an invade and also died quite a few times early to some Jungle and mid roam. Plus looks like she was just Aggro af all game.

There are bad players, there are mismatched players. Some times your going to get them on your team and it sucks.\n\nSome times your teammates think that YOU are the guy put on their team to lose a game or that your mismatched by the system and don't deserve your rank.\n\nMMR systems are blind, they don't coddle any one. Luck is a factor in them, but not enough to outweigh the impact of consistent play and skill. Riot claims it takes 150-300 games, my man That's a pretty big range of games, I have also seen some one build and test MMR [Rabbitonthemoon team elo testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kB2UADNoRUA)  and he was not happy with his system till 400-600 games.\n\nAnyhow, feel free to link me the game your talking about.

Why do you not feel that other players who cost you a loss might be making just a bad decision but would be the systems fault, intention ringgers to lose you a match, and not just humans making a questionabal \n\n> where if you dodge your mmr drops,\n\nDodging does not impact your MMR. One of the stated reasons riot shifted to \"League system\" from Team Elo.  \" Players are punished for queue dodging in a way that makes more sense in terms of progression. Again this reduced dodge rates dramatically\"\n\n> Even in high elo theres soft losses\n\nMaking mismatched games hurts the functionality of MMR systems. They also will calculate for it, its a part of the adjustment formula.  Updated MMR = Old MMR + K(Results-Expectations) \n\nExpectations calculation makes it so if 1 team has higher mmr then the other then the \"advantaged team\" Stands to gain less mmr for a win and lose more on a loss. Vice versa.\n\nSo you can call that a soft loss, teams are mismatched, your risking less mmr.  But I am not exactly shure why you'd consider it to be a punishment rather then just the system pulling players from the pool when it did not have enough around to build a better match.  \n\nI  check MMR before a game ends. A lot of people check MMR after a game concludes.  I know that you need to run 10 Adjustment formulas that may have different variables. A lot of people incorrectly assume every player loses the same MMR and Gains the same MMR. Inherently flawed because you need to rate players individually to track them accurately.\n\nSome folks get mad tilted over a loss streak and make increasingly bad decesions until they drop so low that its really really hard for them to not overperform in games.\n\nIts easy to winif your usualy the best player in a game with undervalued mmr. \n\n\nIts a statistical system. look at %s.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Leetri","date":"2019-01-14T18:14:45.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you're not actually arguing that a \"forced 50% win rate\" is a thing, you just don't like how the promos work.
