I don&#039;t know how to recreate the glitch, or at least I can&#039;t do it by myself. Basically, I evolved into the fire element, then I was fighting someone else. I used my E and R, then I died, getting just enough essence to evolve right as I died. The fire element tag was still lit up, even though I thought it was supposed to be grayed out because I had already evolved into that before. Being curious, I selected the fire element (which it let me do) again, and I, for some reason, evolved into the nature element. Obviously, you cannot do this, and it was even stranger, as I could not evolve into anything else after that. I had no essence bar, and could not gather any, so I was stuck on that at my 2nd evolution. I don&#039;t know how to do it again, but it was extremely strange. I got enough just as I died, that MIGHT be why, but I don&#039;t know. I have never encountered this glitch before on Elementalist Lux. My account name is MadaBucka, the game I encountered on this (I am sorry but I don&#039;t know how to show you the game) on 6/23/17, playing Lux, and my KDA was 3/16/4 with 111 cs, the game lasted 36:28. You can just skip around to around 15-25 minutes when it happens, I was nature for the rest of the game. Sorry for my lack of an explanation or proof.. but, it seems like a really annoying and weird glitch to play with, especially for people who hate the nature form.\n\nEDIT: I played another game. I chose air this time, and when I could evolve again, air was an option I could choose too. So, I did. It evolved me into FIRE this time, both times evolving me one to the right of the portrait. Maybe this is the issue although I do not know. It seems all you have to do to replicate the bug is play Elementalist Lux and choose the same element twice in a row. Air and air, fire and fire, whatever.\n\nDouble Edit: When picking water, it does NOT change the form when you pick water again. Instead, it does not change at all.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-06-26T16:38:50.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! \n\nI appreciate the detailed bug report!
