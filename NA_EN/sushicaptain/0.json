The client minimized as it normally does and then the league game itself should have began to load. Instead the client popped back up after about 1 second and showed the reconnect button. Clicking the button would do nothing but minimize the window and have it pop back up again like before stated. I tried restarting my client to no success, and then after restarting my computer to see if it was a computer issue (it wasn't) and opening my client the game had been remade and thus a loss in my placements and a leaver penalty. Events like this really demoralize one from playing the game and should be fixed immediately.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-30T23:34:11.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm it sounds like something like firewalls or antivirus might have been blocking the loading screen from establishing a solid connection with the game servers. I'd like you to check those settings out really quickly and test it in a custom game if you don't mind.
