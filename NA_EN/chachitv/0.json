Now the reason i'm getting the leaverbuster is mostly due to the client crashing and not being notified(bathroom, eating, homework, etc..), because I'd expected to be logged in and hear the in-game music, so the game ends(by forfeit) without me knowing, because my game loads at about 2 minutes and i don't realise it till 5 minutes and by then, my team has surrendered. I don't know if this is a bug, but it occured twice and i don't want to wait 10 mins(5 minutes for one leave, 10 minutes for 2 games) for a game. I'd probably not play anymore if this occurs because it happened during my promotional ranked games and not on any other ranked or unranked games. The other reason is unrelated to a bug, so I won't comment.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-04T01:11:59.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Typically when you do get hit with a leaverbuster penalty, your account will be in low priority queue for 5 games.
