This will be long (**TLDR at the bottom if you want, but it leaves out some key points and explanations**) but very in depth so I hope this helps:\n\nTeamfighting:\n______________\n\nYou do lots of damage once you reach the fight but you have to consider the damage that you're not doing while you're walking towards the action (compare yourself to a Camille, for example, who can instantly followup and start doing damage right away. Even though her AOE damage might not be quite as powerful as that of Illaoi, you might do comparable levels of damage at the end of the fight). I'd argue that someone like a Camille is superior to Illaoi for teamfights on average seeing as even in the instance that she doesn't match Illaoi's damage, Camille doesn't need to rely on her team to engage for her and she also provides multiple forms of crowd control. A lot of teamfighting as Illaoi comes down to being close enough to their team to followup quickly but far enough away to avoid getting picked off for free before it starts. You do loads of AOE damage so if your team is the one getting engaged on then you'll be able to start pumping it out right away, but generally the teamfight advantage goes to the team who pulls the trigger properly (HEAVY emphasis on the \"properly\" here, we're not counting that one guy who decides to dive in 1v5 and expects the team to followup from halfway across the map) first.\n_____________\n_____________\n\n\nSplitpushing\n______________\n\nAs Illaoi, you're pretty good at fighting 1v1 and 1v2, provided you win lane hard enough to give yourself a large enough lead (winning lane is the easy part and it should happen about 80% of the time, most of playing Illaoi comes down to how you actually use that lead. If you're only winning slightly, going even, or losing lane as Illaoi, chances are you're doing it wrong). Illaoi is great at drawing pressure away from other objectives and forcing the opposing team to allocate multiple members to deal with you, leaving your allies on the other side of the map with a numbers advantage. This is where Illaoi shines brightest. Alhough Illaoi is still able to teamfight, her strengths are best used in a splitpush if all goes according to plan.\n______________\n______________\n\n\nOverall, here is my summary of how to decide between the two choices. You'll have to judge by instinct whether or not your team will be able to hold as a group of 4 while you splitpush or whether you will have to group with them. Generally if other lanes are doing well and your 4 man has a good teamfight, split pushing and forcing the enemy team to send one or more people to deal with you will help your team use their teamfight power better than the extent to which you can compliment it by joining them. Winning lane as Illaoi should almost always be a given, so unless something goes seriously wrong, their top laner should not be able to answer you alone more often than not, provided you're exerting your splitpush power on the map correctly.\n\nTry to remember that your winrate as Illaoi falls off of a cliff the longer the game goes. If you don't see yourself realistically closing the game out by the 25 minute mark, you should try to funnel gold into someone with more scaling around the 20 minute mark and try to help them get into a position where they can help you carry. If you're fighting with your ADC over farm at the 20 minute mark and you haven't started threatening their inhibitor towers, chances are you're making a mistake because you're about to fall off hard and your ADC will probably be able to use the gold better than you can. If you're the only lane winning, split pushing would be the right answer only if two requirements are met. The first of which is that you're winning by a large enough margin to quickly and decisively win 1v1s and 1v2s and come out healthy enough to still threaten towers. The second of which is the requirement that your team is NOT losing so hard that they can get run over in your absence. If everyone else is getting stomped when you leave them, you might want to join them.","replies":[{"poster":"Dotrix","date":"2018-06-22T08:42:20.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TLDR: If all is going well, you're using your lead more effectively by split pushing.","replies":[]}]}]}
