I love playing different champions and getting level 7 mastery just to taunt my friends but recently I am having a huge problem... disconnecting. I never leave games(or leave as infrequently as can) because I feel like I am letting my team down if I do, but just recently I have been getting disconnected with league a lot. It's so bad at this point that I have actually had multiple cool-downs and lost ranked games due to the problem. I have no idea why I can't stay connected to the league of legends servers because other games work great. I uninstalled and reinstalled league but it did nothing. I even downloaded a program called haste(which I found from a SoloRenektonOnly ad),but that doesn't work either. If anyone knows ways that I could just stay connected to the game that would be awesome because I really don't want to be banned or lose anymore ranked game just because my internet craps out on me.
