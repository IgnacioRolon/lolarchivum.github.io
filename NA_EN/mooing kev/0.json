I don't see any way it could.\n\nIf we do go by what you say of them being lore-based though, Zed's Justicar could represent maybe if he wouldn't have looked into the box and not have destroyed their old ninja order.","replies":[{"poster":"missinggrave","date":"2014-12-27T16:32:12.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"And that's a fair point, however I don't see it like that. Why don't I see it like that? Because Zed's abilities come from training, not from the refinement of his abilities like with Syndra. I believe that if he hadn't looked into the box that he wouldn't even have his abilities and he'd be more like Shen with his fighting style, but with a more offensive set of abilities due to their personalities.\n\nAs for Aatrox, it's in my opinion that since he's a conflicting character. One on hand, he helps people win wars throughout history. On the other hand, HE HELPS PEOPLE WIN WARS THROUGHOUT HISTORY. I believe that Justicar Aatrox shows a part of him as more of a defender of the weak, rather than someone who can turn several men into bloodthirsty savages. He's someone who uses war to end war, rather than continuing it. Maybe that doesn't make sense, but it's just my opinion on how it's the same Aatrox using his abilities for the greater good in my opinion.\n\nTL;DR It's really just my opinion and I don't like it. Nothing wrong with that, just like there's nothing wrong with yours. :) < Agree to disagree even if I look silly with my opinion?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Juniie","date":"2014-12-27T13:36:02.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Clause Vance,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=75ufeEQa,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2014-12-26T18:08:37.002+0000)\n>\n> It does not really fit with his lore, not at all -_- .\n\nYes Very True .. :p idgaf lol just saying its not like all skin have to go with lore if u know wat i trying to say{not a joke}.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AeronerII","date":"2014-12-26T17:42:10.930+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"looks bad ass","replies":[]},{"poster":"19 19 19","date":"2014-12-26T20:37:53.841+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"SO MANY people have made threads about this -facepalm-","replies":[]},{"poster":"KnKitsune","date":"2015-01-16T13:01:54.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks very much more Hextech than Justicar.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talll","date":"2014-12-30T00:29:41.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy fuck this is like the first champion skin concept that I've seen that looks fucking amazing bro.

Her power is almost godly so the Justicar skin represents her as an almost ascended being. \nAatrox travels through time and appears at various points changing the course of wars and fights, making losing fights turn around and cause people to turn savage and lose all fear. His Justicar skin is possibly how the humans see him based on the stories and the legends, seeing him as a God who brought them hope in the darkest of times, although at a second glance we see that the fighters did terrible things due to Aatrox's influence.\n\nFor Zed, this can be his God-like status after delving into the darkest of arts. These arts taught him true power and thus earning him a place in the Justicar skin set.\n\nNone of the champs are aligned with factions. They do what they want, when they want, no shits given.\n\nMake this skin happen, Rito!","replies":[]},{"poster":"DSRM Mobius","date":"2014-12-26T20:28:56.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pls riot ive been waiting forever","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mooing Kev","date":"2014-12-26T18:31:35.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"welp first time posting and didn't realize this is repost and was already mentioned 2 months ago. gg still rito make it happen","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Chin","date":"2014-12-26T18:09:34.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"omg... that's so cool! ._.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Poptart Evelynn","date":"2014-12-26T17:30:20.075+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":12,"body":"It's cool but please no more Zeds.
