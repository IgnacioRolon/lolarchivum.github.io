I was one of those people who \"hacked\" the game to get attack move on left-click, however, I rebound all the previous left-click actions to my middle mouse button. Will there eventually be a way to do what the title says? I really love the introduction of the ability to actually not have to go into my games files to change my auto attack key bind, but the inability to change the key bind that was previously used for left-click feels very lackluster. I hope this would be a feature Riot is considering adding into the game.\r\n\r\nP.S. - I didn't know what board to put this in so i just put it in here","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-26T22:10:46.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Done!  :P  You're in luck, it released this patch.  You'll find it in-game under your Hotkey options at the very bottom.  See [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/aAxGzpC.png).  :D\n\nThere isn't a method currently to rebind other keys, like the middle mouse, though.  I recommend sharing this feedback over at the [Gameplay ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance)boards!","replies":[{"poster":"Voyboy Sucks","date":"2017-07-26T22:30:27.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!
