Yes the idea might prevent some juggernauts from using the item like Urgot or Illaoi. Maybe my idea could get changed around a bit like “if your champion can dash this many units, you can’t use the item’s passives”. The main goal is to prevent champions like Irelia and Riven from abusing it since the item was designed for Juggernauts.","replies":[]}
