Yes I know many people will complain that it brought more cancerous champions to top lane but I think whoever made those changes did a good job. \n\nWhen you make a bunch of changes like those to Aatrox and Tahm you can expect them to be either way too op or too weak. Whenever a champion gets reworked or is released into the public for the first time they are always either too strong or weak and that’s because it’s hard to get a champion made correctly first try. There’s not a good way to know how the champion will be until you see how players interact with each other regarding those changes. \n\nSo yes they both became op which is not a surprise but that doesn't mean the balance team should just immediately give up and just gut Tahm again. It makes no sense, why are they putting effort into Aatrox to get him into a spot he deserves but Tahm can't get the same love? If you are gonna make a bunch of changes to someone like with Tahm and Aatrox, you might have to go through trial and error to fix the problematic parts of the champion.\n\nAll they needed to do was nerf his passive damage and make it scale again like it used to and increase Q cooldown. Heck they could have even given his Q a unique champion cooldown like Yasuo's E or Rek Sai's W. Something like: If champion has been stunned by Tahm's Q, then they can't be stunned again for X seconds.\n\nBut nope rather than trying to help some gutted champions get back in a good spot you just instantly give up after only 2 attempts of patching him.","replies":[{"poster":"General Ramses","date":"2019-07-18T23:01:10.898+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi i am a Tahm Kench player.\nTahm Kench is unplayable after this nerf basically everything has been set to useless. \nQ dont apply lick + damage nerfed, \nW slow 95% with any champion so he is not even a good support + no lick applied with minion spit. \nE maxxed only give 65% and degenerate fast. Hard to shield yourself if half of shield is gone because of shield degeneration is fast.  \n\nSome other guy in a thread called his ulti useless which its not or at least now you will have to carry someone with you for it to matter.\nI would call that 50% nerf on the ulti because depending if i was alone or not i would use it to zone people away from carry or catch escapists. \n\nThis nerf is way too hard on Tahm Kench. All his tools has been stripped from him.\nAll that was fun about him is gone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Woodakoodashooda","date":"2019-07-16T07:13:48.588+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everything done to Tahm because \"competitive coordinated play\" needs to be reverted.
