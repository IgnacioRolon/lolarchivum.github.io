The champion must be primary assassin, not secondary assassin. Otherwise every ADC with the secondary role as assassin would count.\r\n\r\n2. It can’t be a non-assassin building assassin items. Examples:  AD Darius,  AD Thresh, AP Rakan, Assassin Jayce.\r\n\r\nAlright those all the rules. I’m curious to see what people will say.","replies":[{"poster":"The thigh guy","date":"2020-01-24T05:50:37.611+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:141}} \nHe has very defined strengths and will fuck you up if you play into them and even more defined weaknesses. As well as actually needing to land his entire kit in order to get kills unlike a large chunk of other assassins in this game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2020-01-24T04:48:27.299+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:245}} is pretty fair, it never feels like he just got a kill by clicking your face. You get feedback as to what you did wrong.\n\n{{champion:131}} is annoying, but has clear weaknesses. No ability to retreat or self-peel easily.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PhearBunny","date":"2020-01-24T15:21:26.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like the most FAIR assassin is Nocturne.\nBut Assassins arent supposed to be fair, they are supposed to punish people for being alone and out of position.\nSo in this sense, Nocturne is a bit of a failure since his R can be dodged with any mobility. There is even a movespeed threshold you can hit to avoid his ult by simply moving in any direction that isnt towards Nocturne.\nEven if it does land, there are very few targets(with equal farm) that he can actually duel in time enough to be successful.","replies":[]}]}
