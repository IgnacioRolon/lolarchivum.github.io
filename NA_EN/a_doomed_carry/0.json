But the new leaver buster system is way out of hand. I literrally never afk, but last game I kept getting the Firewall error, an I run no Firewall. W/e ,I connected when my teamates were level 4-6. I ended the game 12/0 a kha zix. After the game I get a message saying my que is low priority now due to afking... I never have connection issues, and the one time I do I get some low priority stuff. seems out of hand to me.

In fact, LeaverBuster even had you acknowledge and type \"I Agree\" well in advance of actually being punished by the system.\n\nThe whole typing \"I Agree\" thing is really really insulting to players like me, who never willingly leave any game for any reason, when we are disconnected and subsequently locked out by some kind of technical issue.  The last time this happened, I had a brownout, and when I tried to reconnect after rebooting, the launcher decided to scan all files, which took a nice long time.\n\nLeaverBuster presumes an intent to leave deliberately, and that's a pretty crappy assumption to make.  Designing a system to address a problem with a vast number of possible causes as if there is really only one major class of cause is a bad idea, because you risk alienating the portion of your player base that was dropped from a game through no fault of their own.  Please consider changing the language to something more generic, like \"you have been reported for leaving your last game.  If you are reported X more times within Y time, your account will be banned for Z time.  If you are experiencing technical difficulties, please consider resolving them before attempting to join more matches, in order to avoid being banned.\"  Or something.\n\nYou can still make people type something, like \"ok,\" so you still get that kind of acknowledgment, and it works for players who have actually quit the game in a rage or because pizza showed up or whatever other garbage reason, as well as players who just spent 20 minutes banging their head against the wall trying to get back into the game, only to find that when they finally did reconnect, the game was over, and the system decided they must have left on purpose, and should get a stern finger-wagging.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Epilogue of Life","date":"2014-12-16T01:48:09.277+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"But really, have you seem how much laggier the game has been lately?

I never leave games or surrender by choice. I did go through a spell of connectivity issues, but that was a 1-2 months ago. I have since then fixed the issue and haven't left a game since then. Just now I got an error and some very weird lag where my fps and ping were fine but nothing was registering until about 4-5 seconds had passed. I got disconnected and attempted to reconnect twice but failed. I then hard restarted my comp and that seemed to work. I came back in and did my best to help out. I was only lv 4 and everyone else was 10 + but I'm not one to back down without a fight. I assisted my team in a final Team Fight before the enemy surrendered after we aced them. As soon as the ending game screen came up I got a warning stating that I too was on a low que for 5 games due to recent afk and leaving being detected. Not only was my feelings hurt but I am also depressed by the fact that \"recent afk activity\" means 1 game in 1-2 months. Could you shed some light on what my future holds with leaverbuster? I am a hard working and Loyal teammate. I am the first to fight and the last retreat, and will without a second thought, give my life for my allies.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrGlidester","date":"2014-12-21T18:22:38.423+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah about a minute ago i got disconnected at beginning of the game couldn't reconnect to the game and when my friend who was duo queing with me said the game was over it game me a loss for that game. Oh and btw it was a ranked game promos and riot just costed me a promo match.  And while back ago had the same issue where i got disconnected and could not connect back then i got the leaverbuster thing and had to type I agree into the box I am just a little fed up with the connection issues to the servers and it say that its my firewall blocking league.

I was stuck on the loading screen for an ARAM game quite some time, while this does have a frustratingly high occurrence, it does happen - I was given a warning after entering the game at level 5 (team mates were level 5-6). There is also the constant lag/spike that causes players to d/c from time to time, not just me, but the people I've been in game with, which makes me think that part of this problem is not on the players, but on Riot, and they are 'warning' us for a problem that is not entirely caused by the players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mister Love","date":"2014-12-17T04:09:37.177+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have the same issue, but my problem is that it doesn't tell me how many games I have left to complete before I can actually complete this LeaverBuster Low Priority thing.

As someone who tested it before it was implemented I know for a fact it tells you. but if you are in the same boat as the op as he was claiming to be punished after one afk (which is more like 3) then I'm not sure how honest you are being or how much attention you are paying to the system.","replies":[]}]}]}
