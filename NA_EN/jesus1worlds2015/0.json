Honestly, despite loads of my own feedback disparaging the identity-shaping elements of the Quinn rework, I still find a lot of Quinn ragers are WAY too whiny, spouting apocalyptic characterizations of the Valor gutting.\n\nThen again, that happens with every patch. You can't debuff Veigar by removing the damage from the poro sneezing next to him without some player declaring defcon 5. \n\nBut I can still see the \"Quinn squad\" has already started to hate on your comment. Oh well. I'm with ya at least.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"EcchiOtakuTM","date":"2015-11-28T22:36:27.563+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Her win rate is still > 55 and even 60 for the more experienced\n\nI love my girl quinn but They need to remove shiv+firecannon stacking first\n\nAfter that if the champs who abuse it are still a  problem they need to (Quinn-wise)\n\nIncrease the vision radius for rank 1-4 q\n\nAfter that if quinn is still a problem \n\nRaise her passive CD to 10 but make it scale down to 3 (I'm not sure on the lowest cdr at max crit) seconds at 100% crit chance like it does currently\n\nHowever I doubt after the vision nerf and firecannon+shiv cannon nerf happen quinn will need anything else","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThePartyLeader","date":"2015-11-28T22:31:25.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or people found out she's at 70% win rate so every tom dick and Harry is playing her without a clue how to.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OxBaker","date":"2015-11-28T22:29:03.913+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"Hope they gut her.
