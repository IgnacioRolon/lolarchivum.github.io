There is nothing more frustrating that getting Karma only to be stuck with Nunu 30 seconds later.\n\nPositives of Keeping the champion after the dodge: \n\n-There is no reason to dodge anymore (other than toxic players) since you know it will change nothing\n-People who got a champion they were happy about are not forced to reroll if they got something drastically worse than the one they had before\n\nNegatives Of Keeping The Champion:\n\n-Re-rolls would become an issue and some players could get frustrated if they get stuck with their most hated champ.\n\nAny Opinions?\n\nIs this necesary?\n\n{{sticker:sg-ezreal}}","replies":[{"poster":"paisy","date":"2018-01-20T10:49:03.171+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's annoying when I get a fun champ and someone dodges, but I like when I get a lame champ then someone dodges.

If they are stuck with that champ in their next queue there won't be any incentive to dodge.  Its along the lines of the suggestion that ARAM should give a random champ out of ALL the champs, not just the ones you have unlocked.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2018-01-19T20:33:15.629+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dakuraigun","date":"2018-01-19T20:29:21.236+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree with this mostly on the premise that when I get someone I can't play for crap right after I got a really good champ for the mode, it's frustrating.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Der Lindwurm","date":"2018-01-20T00:45:58.864+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yes, for all the people who didn't dodge.\n\nPeople who dodge should have to play that champion for the next 5 ARAMs so they can git gud and not have to dodge whenever they get that champion anymore.\n\nThough I suppose then you'd have people intentionally dodging because they got Lux.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ƒrostγ","date":"2018-01-19T21:51:24.345+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ezreal is bae.","replies":[{"poster":"Lumiose9","date":"2018-01-19T22:07:50.993+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Frøsted,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=zpuGZs3P,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-01-19T21:51:24.345+0000)\n>\n> Ezreal is bae.\n\nhe is my husbando {{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2018-01-20T23:00:27.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there is a really really high chance either you or some one else on your team gets it either initally or 1-2 rolls on your team as far as i have seen aram is anything but random","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hollow Miracles","date":"2018-01-20T00:42:06.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add it to the long list of things Riot will literally never do.

Im fine with aram as it is but it could improve so much.\n\nbtw what do you mean by full champion roster? (i know you are more likely to get champs in the free rotation)","replies":[{"poster":"Hollow Miracles","date":"2018-01-20T14:37:02.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I say \"full champion roster\", I mean that the champion you get in a match should be selected from a pool consisting of every single champion in the game. Right now, the system is set up to choose a champion from only the ones you own + the free rotation. This leads to the creation of \"ARAM accounts\", which will unlock only the most powerful champions (on ARAM anyway) so that they have a much higher chance of getting something strong.\n\nImagine getting into a game where everyone else has unlocked every single champion (that's 134 as of right now), while you've unlocked only a handful of things you picked specifically because they're strong (i.e. {{champion:81}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:37}} etc). You now have an advantage in that you can only ever get a strong champion (or something from the free rotation). It's not a perfect way to cheat the system, but it drastically reduces the risk associated with a supposedly \"random\" system.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
