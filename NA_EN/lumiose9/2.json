I never thought id have this reaction. \n\nIt all started in the loading screen where i could see my ping suddenly skyrocketing. Never a good start. Everything was fine for 5 minutes or so until Me and 2 other members from my team started disconnecting at the same time. At first I thought it was a very strange coinidence and I didnt start blaming DDos or hacks... But then Everything in the game started to freeze and my Screen went Completly Black. All i could see was my cursor (i also could hear the audio). Then whiles i was rushing to try and solve the problem i heard 3 people disconnect from my team.\n\nOnce it was &quot;solved&quot; (i had to fully restart my pc) ..  the enemy Xayah started hardcore BMing my team, Killing them when someone randomly stopped walking and typing &quot;ez noobs&quot; . This also continued in the post game lobby where the situation got extremly toxic. \n\nI just wanted to have a chill / fun night of league of legends, and after this one game, thats no longer the plan. Yes, I am extremly salty so save your comments calling me out. \n\n2 Weeks ago I posted a discussion in the boards about how i was &quot;pleasantly surprised by the community&quot; ... Its Facinating how one experience can ruin your mindset for i dont know how long.\n\nXayah or one of her premades was 100% hacking and I seriously hope she gets Perma-Banned. \n\nYeah, That was My rant! what was the worst experience youve had? {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"A Dizzy Lulu","date":"2018-02-13T13:05:45.474+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"it happens,  just go next","replies":[{"poster":"Recon1212","date":"2018-02-13T16:16:59.452+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"That does not just \"happen\" lol.
