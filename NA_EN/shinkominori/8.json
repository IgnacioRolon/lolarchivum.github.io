Targeted damage and CC, even if it is a slow, is still very viable in this game, and very necessary for dealing with the disgusting amount of mobility in the game. \n\nBlood Boil, on the other hand, I do agree with 100%. The skill is dated and needs to replaced with something else. \n\nAs for the lack of hard CC everyone keeps mentioning - you can still be a good support without stunning or rooting someone. If stuns and roots are handed out like candy, they become cliche and the champs with them become less unique. Nunu dealing in heavy slows is perfect as it is, and I do think they can refine him without resorting to default stuns/roots that they use with every champion these days.","replies":[{"poster":"10Tickler","date":"2016-06-22T00:24:40.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:89}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:136}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:26}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:45}} \n\nThis is a list for you, of champions that are Fairly to moderately to Excellently able to support, who have Debilitating CC (Stuns, Knockups, Roots, Silences, Taunts)","replies":[{"poster":"RobbieFry13","date":"2016-06-23T00:15:42.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You forgot {{champion:3}} \nHis Ult (while too easy to interrupt) has a taunt that can be awesome if timed correctly, especially if your ADC is {{champion:21}}","replies":[{"poster":"10Tickler","date":"2016-06-23T03:45:44.540+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:3}} works even better with {{champion:429}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"bulldoggamer","date":"2016-06-22T02:30:47.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also could you name me a good support that doesn't have at least 1 form of hard CC?

The reason i like the idea of a skill shot is it allows you to put more power into the ability without it becoming broken. And it also makes the champion more fun to play because there is more skill involved thus you are more rewarded for using this ability successfully. It's just good game design. \nThe reason why i think he needs hard CC is because of his tank playstyle. Without hard CC he's going to get outclassed by almost every tank in the game. It will also help solidify his jungle playstyle since it will actually allow him to gank effectively in this hypermobile state of the game. (idea: his ult could provide the same form of cc as {{champion:69}} W along with the slow) Even that little bit of hard(ish?) CC would help him immensely. \nAlso could you name me a good support that doesn't have at least 1 form of hard CC? I can't think of any. \nI appreciate the input man.
