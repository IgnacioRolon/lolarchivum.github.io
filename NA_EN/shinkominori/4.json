Now a matches end at 20-25 minutes... even at 10 minutes when one side is super fed since the turrets are really weak and its so easy to snowball by Riot design. Riot is going for the lowest common denominator.\n\nThe game is either one stomp on one side or the other and it doesn&#039;t feel like even trying anymore. I used to never surrender and fight until the nexus is destroyed. But when you encounter a fed Darius or a fed Ryze and a team thats 1 whole rank below you or even unranked whats the point anymore? its impossible to outplay and they will only keep taking objectives until you lose. I surrender at 20 most of the times now, whats the point? \n\nIs this what Riot wants with its game? meaningless matches to cross fingers that you got the good premade? Is it true that the game has gone downhill since season 3?","replies":[{"poster":"FEDXSai","date":"2016-06-17T00:04:01.335+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":16,"body":"lose in 10 minutes?","replies":[{"poster":"ShinkoMinori","date":"2016-06-17T00:06:11.297+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FXDeathSerum,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dQqOuuYk,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-06-17T00:04:01.335+0000)\n>\n> lose in 10 minutes?\n\nat minute 10 you know who is gonna win, 0-12 and such.","replies":[{"poster":"FEDXSai","date":"2016-06-17T00:12:45.487+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":26,"body":"sounds like low elo probs. just focus drag since it snowballs you harder than anything else in this game now","replies":[{"poster":"ShinkoMinori","date":"2016-06-17T00:14:18.264+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FXDeathSerum,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=dQqOuuYk,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2016-06-17T00:12:45.487+0000)\n>\n> sounds like low elo probs. just focus drag since it snowballs you harder than anything else in this game now\n\nYou don't play much or watch streams do you?... or are you calling doublelift low elo lmao.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aír","date":"2016-06-17T14:00:45.359+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are joking right?

Hardly.\n\nWidowmaker, a sniper, was able to one-shot bodyshot kill three characters in the game (Un-meched D.Va, Tracer, and Zenyatta). Not only that, but her ability to quickly charge a shot made it incredibly easy for her to very quickly bodyshot many other characters to death. Basically she had a sniper's damage and range without the drawback of actually having to get head shots. The changes Blizzard made were simple and effective. They reduced bodyshot damage to 120 (so she no longer one shots those three characters) and made her scoping slightly slower. She still does good damage, has strong mobility, and is possibly in need of even more work. You saying she was \"gutted\" is a joke.\n\nMcCree? He was, across the board from professional to casual play, regarded as an unbalanced menace. With the damage on his Fan the Hammer he was able to successfully duel quite literally every hero in the game. Using his combo of Flashbang/Fan the Hammer/roll/Fan the Hammer he could 100 to 0 the majority of the cast before they even got a chance to properly react. How did they fix this? Without touching his roll or Flashbang they reduced his Fan the Hammer damage. They didn't nerf it into the ground, they just lowered it enough that McCree players actually have to hit all their shots from Fan the Hammer to get a reliable kill (not hard if you Flashbang first) and lowered the damage enough that a tank could ACTUALLY tank. Not only that, but they actually decreased his reload speed to compensate for the damage drop. Again, he's still perfectly viable.\n\nThe fact that you complain about these changes and call them \"unbalanced\" really only shows you either 1) don't play the game enough or 2) were really enjoying playing these unbalanced champs and are now salty that you actually have to learn some fundamentals to succeed on them.","replies":[{"poster":"Weiner the Pooh","date":"2016-06-17T22:41:07.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes i played mostly them but not because they were easy wins or whatever.
