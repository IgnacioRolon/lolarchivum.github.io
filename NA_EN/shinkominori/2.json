The page actually listed \"crafting materials\" as items that would expire so it was perfectly clear that the cores and blueprints that you could \"craft\" from were going to expire. I looked again over and over in all your announcements and you made perfectly clear to list every item BUT the \"AUGMENT CACHE\" so I want to know how was I supposed to know I wouldn't be able to use them after the event?\n\nI also want to add that every item had a \"this item will expire by xx date\" every item but the \"AUGMENT CACHE\" boxes","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nautoday","date":"2017-05-08T03:52:18.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never got the gifting Rakan/Xayah one either. :/","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-08T04:29:37.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Check it now ^_^!","replies":[{"poster":"EmperorPengu","date":"2017-05-08T19:59:56.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey broporo I never got the icon for gifting rakan.
