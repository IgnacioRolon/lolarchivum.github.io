I played another game afterwards and there still aren't any voices. I went into a custom game and no voices on el tigre but there are voices on standard braum","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Wittrock","date":"2015-02-12T09:17:47.434+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I care!!\n\nThis unfortunate bug is on its way to being fixed.
