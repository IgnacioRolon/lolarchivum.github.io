My internet and router itself are fine (I initially thought that was the issue of course) as I regularly play other games like Destiny and Rocket League with zero lag and my ping tests for my router show no issue. Is there any settings issue with the recent Windows 10 update that could have messed with my LoL specifically? (Shared updates are turned off on my computer so that isn't the issue, even though that is a common one found on reddit).  Thanks for any replies in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-17T18:12:23.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is having issues maintaining a steady connection to our servers, and could even be suffering packet loss.

After the log reader it recommended adding an exception to my webroot....and that fixed the issue instantly! I remember there being an exception already way back, but the recent W10 update must have reverted the setting. all good now :)","replies":[]}]}]}
