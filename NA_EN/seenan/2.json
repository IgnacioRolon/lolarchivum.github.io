E->E->charged E onto them, chunk them with Q ->E back to safety because your cd on E is 0.1 from 0.5 which means faster trades/engages/???.\n\nCome midgame you'll start actually making damage (Shiv is first usually) and Q damage will come into play better.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-11-25T06:07:43.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I meant is that Q goes 20>40>60>80>100 while E goes 70>90>110>130>150.

In a mirror match, it might work, since Yasuo has no scaling MR, but it's not the most reliable thing and you'll *have* to go in with a charged E whenever the opposing Yas's shield is down.\n\nNow, I am actually a proponent of maxing Q vs. certain melee match ups where you don't want to just scrap it out but this post is very misguided and does not offer good advice.\n\nYasuo does plenty of damage on his own and the damage difference between the two skills is minimal. In a situation where you want to get into the wave and harass however, E max offers significantly more mobility and out play potential. It is also worth noting that frequent use of E charges your passive shield faster because the shield charges based upon movement. E max lowers the cool down on E significantly and is the appropriate response in most lanes where you can bully your opponent.\n\nThe only time I advocate a Q max ever is when you are unlikely to be able to engage on a melee range opponent.  Take Renekton for example. If you engage on him, he -will- shit on you. I'd much rather sit behind my minion line and punish him for trying to CS from safety. \n\nFor a Q max to work the enemy must need to get into melee range to CS and they also must be threatening enough that you do not want to try to outplay them because you will likely die.\n\nThe idea is to poke them down enough when they try to CS that they don't want to engage on you while you farm up for your power spike (which used to be Shiv, although I'm hearing that may have changed this patch).","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-11-25T07:06:11.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The difference between the cooldown between E's levels is low enough to be basically irrelevant and the internal timer, lowered as it might be, is not necessarily a big enough advantage to make up for running around with an unleveled Q.\n\nUltimately, the damage difference between your E and your Q is too low, in my opinion, to make up for all the trouble you bring yourself by using it as your main damage tool.\n\nAt most, you're able to cut your windows of engagement by 4 seconds, get an extra 50 or so damage if you trade with only a single Q, and might leave the laning phase in a far less effective state.\n\nI, for one, do not want to try to bully my lane opponent marginally better in exchange for being weaker until level 13 or so and getting a smaller mid-game power spike.\n\nAlso, with the weaker Shiv, it might be worth looking into either getting a PD or a Trinity with around 10% extra crit from your runes. Personally, I don't like the Trinity Force on Yasuo so much because it doesn't jelly super well with his cooldown timers, nor is his base attack anything special. It's certainly not bad by any means, it's just that damage isn't something he's hurting for and it ends up interfering with your optimal aa/Q rotation so you can get the most out of it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Psyturkey","date":"2015-11-25T08:17:50.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"An additional note for Q max first: If you are running Warlords and are able to use your Q to poke, a Q max will give you more sustain in lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Midder Scray","date":"2015-11-25T07:52:47.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always max Q first too, but that's because I don't usually play aggressively with Yasuo.
