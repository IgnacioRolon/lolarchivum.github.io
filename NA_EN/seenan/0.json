Let me know if you have any issues afterwards!\n\nI'm thinking it's moreso the terrible air client that Riot's held onto for 5 years. My connection is 100% fine with anything else, and it doesn't even have the occasional dc unless it's a literal ISP maintenance. \n\nWhy would a connection issue be the issue if I can manage to receive patch files (download+update), accept the license agreement many times after trying LAUNCH (many meaning after reopening client), and even use internet in the first place? \nAs another note, whenever I start the launcher itself, even when it's just idling, everything on my comp starts fizzling(music) and lagging in some way. Still the connection's fault? And it's not cause my pc is bad, unless you call 16 GB ram and recent gen i7 bad.","replies":[]}]}]}
