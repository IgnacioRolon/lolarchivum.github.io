I&#039;d say for the small subset of champs that Liandry works really well on (dot champs), Guise or the entirety of Liandry should be less pricey. It&#039;s no wonder that non-dot champs would pretty much never even try buying the item (maybe Syndra?). It&#039;s the same price of Rylai&#039;s with 100 less hp, 20 less AP, 15 extra mpen, and a somewhat situational passive compared to Rylai&#039;s. Since they&#039;re both used in tandem when Liandry is necessary (or just good for the current champ), one amplifies the other, but that&#039;s a hefty 6.4k gold. \n\n\nOne or both of Guise/Liandry has to drop in price, imo.\n\ninb4 this would break dot champs...Come on, they&#039;re already pretty ridiculous just by their kit (see: Brand, Malz).\n\nEDIT: I just looked up the changes from back then and Liandry's was 2.9k with 50 AP and a slightly different build path. Now it's 3.2k with **30** more AP...This item's inconsistencies are ridiculous. 300 gold = 30 AP apparently. For Riot liking clean numbers, this item sure isn't clean at all.

Voidstaff is basically the pre-rework LW, it's good against everything all the time.  If you want to deal magic damage it must be in your build somewhere.  Meanwhile, like you point out, you have a flat pen item building into an attempted tank melter.\n\nInstead there should be a new %pen component (like LW) that builds into Liandry's and the new AP GW item (don't just randomly toss GW on something that is popular for its stats alone, make it something you intentionally invest in against Mundo/Swain/etc.).  \n\nA flat pen component (whether it's HG or something new) should build into a burst/assassin-mage item that helps a lot for blowing up squishies but doesn't perform as well against tanks.
