I don&#039;t even main ADCs...buuuuut...\r\n\r\nTying her attack-speed to her Oathsworn is a terrible idea.\r\nIt&#039;s an ADC, not an A&amp;SDC (Attack &amp; Support Damage Carry(?)). \r\nAnd even worse, it&#039;s per level...So she&#039;s labelled as a permanently lategame champ for her already atrocious early game due to her Oathsworn needing to be around for her to be at top damage. \r\n\r\nAnd funnily enough, her total attack damage is still at 90%, just because of her hopping mechanic. She doesn&#039;t even build attack-damage oriented items until later, so this pretty much helps mess up her early/midgame damage (bork is only 25 damage). All she really needed was to have her dashes be reduced if slowed by cc...and she got that...but other nerfs weren&#039;t reverted. If anything, her W max hp% should be per level, since it&#039;s leveled last anyway.\r\n\r\nI actually like Kalista as a champion, as obnoxious as she was at launch. Facing her as an immobile melee champ is a joke. But dumpstering her is not the way to &#039;nerf&#039; her.","replies":[{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2016-10-20T15:05:25.460+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kalista is a hard counter champion.

Like I said in the OP, making her dashes weaker due to slows is good enough...since there's about 200 things that slow in this game, she can probably be handled. I've never really had a problem with Kalista..except for this one time I was Garen.

I don't know why everybody is so keen on her having jungle objective control in the first place. Junglers are supposed to have that kind of control, not someone built for a position that is meant for sustain damage champions. \n\nNasus isn't a super tank. He's a bruiser.

And that's kind of the goal of having power combining with your oathsworn.\n\nThe goal in building Kalista was to have somebody that works ideally with a partner champion.

It's already hard enough stacking on champions as they die particularly fast mid-late game anyway if they're not a tank.

Even when she has a bloodthirster, her damage is succeeded by any other ADC because of .9x total AD.\n\nI'm sure she can be a 'learner champ' and still be even remotely viable.
