He tried many tickets to recover, but for some reason, the support staff cannot prove he is the owner, and are refusing to give it back. But I have been with him for 8 years and i saw him create the account and everything :( The hacker played with his account for a few games, and stopped playing, its been 8 days of inactivity. He played with a level 5 account and a bronze one for almost every game (which i believe could be the hackers accounts and that he was trying to level it up fast. Or maybe he is using bots to level up account to sell and uses the account he stole from my boyfriend as a booster. Is there any way to verify if there is a link between those 2 accounts, and is there any way to get a real support to actually help him? He is willing to answer and give many proofs, but the support either dont have the rights or the knowledge to look at them. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-21T21:26:01.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The account recovery team assists with recovery cases, and are real people.  We won't restore access to an account unless we are absolutely certain it's being returned to the owner.  Even if recovery fails the first time, it's okay to keep trying.  There's no further detail I can provide here on a public forum or with someone other than the owner.  If your boyfriend already has a ticket open with a specialist, rest easy knowing they'll do all they can to help with the process.  Best of luck!","replies":[]}]}
