No transaction history could be found. That's pretty cheap for someone who owns every skin currently available I'd say! I don't know about you, but I'd rather not send a hand written letter along with $5 to get 3 months worth of junk and a detailed report of all transactions that comes with the \"Looking for More\" button. I'd rather have that one page with the general statistics :)","replies":[]}]}
