I don&#039;t think it&#039;s justified, but I admit I have been very toxic and mean recently. However, this was in very few instances of recent times, and I didn&#039;t have a warning at all. More so, I don&#039;t think it deserved a permaban. I was toxic in the past, have had multiple suspensions and chat bans, but this caught me completely off guard. I have seen and done worse without punishment, admittedly, and am wondering if I could do anything to repeal it? The link I was given to try combat it just said that everything I wrote was redacted. For context, I&#039;ve had this account since ~season 1. I&#039;ve made friends, memories, and its inexplicably a part of my childhood I wish never to lose. Honestly, I wish for a permanent chat ban due to my toxicity, because I feel as if its the most helpful thing. I&#039;ve spent literal weeks on this game, and with the amount of hours I&#039;ve poured into it, all of my grinding, how many champions I own, my rarest skins, and all of the money I&#039;ve spent on this game, I really have can&#039;t explain how worried I am. I can&#039;t even go back to see my account, it&#039;s just been completely dissipated. On top of this, I was banned over very mild toxicity. I may have said people were bad, but that was the extent of it. Can I possible appeal to reduce the punishment?","replies":[{"poster":"Racc101","date":"2017-02-07T02:03:16.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have my chatlogs from my recent game as well if anyone would like it.

You have complete control over what you say in game, and it does not matter whether you reacted to someone or not. Riot does not remove punishments unless they were issued in error, which based on what you are saying is not the case. \n\nPunishments work in tiers, tier 1 and 2 are chat restrictions (cant remember how many games for some reason), tier 3 is a two week suspension, and then after is a permanent suspension. You can lower your tier with periods of no toxicity, which is probably why you have been suspended multiple times. Anything that can get a chat restriction can get you a permaban, it is just a matter of where you are on the tier.\n\nAlso, Riot does not issue permanent chat suspensions. If you want to mute yourself you can drag your chat off screen, resize it in the config files, or remove the key binding for your enter key through a third party application.\n\nAs it stands, you have had multiple chances to improve your behavior and you did not.","replies":[{"poster":"Racc101","date":"2017-02-07T02:17:00.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Context certainly matters, and that's undeniably true. If I'm complaining or appearing to flame, you may not realize it's me complaining about myself, which I don't believe is toxic...\n\nAdditionally, on that punishment tier thing, if that's true I'm confused because my last suspension or chat ban might have been over a year ago...","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-02-07T02:21:14.221+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, now that I see your logs, this is probably the biggest issue.\n\nGame 1\nRacc101: Saaaay %%%%%%!!!\n\nHate speech escalates you punishment tiers, often a permaban  on sight or at least a two week ban. It was probably your punishment history that escalated it past two week.\n\nAnd no, context does not matter. It does not matter when or how you say any of what you said, it is still contributing to the negative environment. You should just mute the person, report them after the game, and move on with your life.","replies":[{"poster":"Racc101","date":"2017-02-07T02:24:50.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hm.

If you say a racist word, you WILL be banned. End of story.\n\nBest of luck with a new account. I recommend turning off chat completely, if you can't help yourself from raging at people.\n\nIf you think you have the balls to think before you type, then I recommend utilizing mental warfare that bypasses the chat detectors.  For example, you can use \"?\" over and over when people start talking shit to you, or do other things ingame if someone is being a dick or whatever to you (for example, playing support and adc is a dipshit feeder with no brains? stand behind them, wait for them to die then pick up the CS/kills. Tell them \"I'm the carry now\". Playing top lane and enemy mid keeps roaming but your mid is too stupid to do MIA or follow? Get a chance to go to mid to \"gank\" and take all his farm\" When he complains, go \"???\".)\n\nThis way, the assholes that DO rage (like you have), can be reported and punished by the system, and you get away with the satisfaction of tilting some deadbeat motherfuckers.\n\nAbove all else, never EVER type anything toxic in chat, even jokes, even sarcasm, if you can help it. Not even banter.\n\nI just came off a 2 week ban, and realized I had to stop typing whatsoever so I wouldn't get perma'd. Started doing the aforementioned above and now the notifications about my reports sticking someone the D are rolling in sometimes 2 per day (depends on how many games you play a day and how many morons/ragers you gotta report). It's extremely satisfying.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mus","date":"2017-02-07T03:10:39.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't count your luck\nIf you've been punished in the past alot, then your not showing any form of reform.\nAlso if a behavior is truly excessive, Riot could skip tiers level of punishments.\nIf you were given a 14 day ban before. Then you'll receive a perma ban for this.\n\nLike what some of said, I recommended you don't create another account unless you know you can keep your comments in line. People have bad games and if Quinn was truly toxic. Mute him and report him after. Don't sit there and flame each other for the entire game. Takes 1 report to punish someone keep in mind.
