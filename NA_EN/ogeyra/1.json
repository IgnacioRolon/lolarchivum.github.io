I've tried everything I can find in the Connection Issues page, as well as the Hextech Repair Tool, and have also tried installing the game to my SSD (primary OS drive) and my HDD.  No matter what I do, after passing through Champion select, the game does not load properly.  An invisible window will appear in my taskbar, but it will never load the game.  I have also made sure I have all updated drivers for my network and graphics card.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-07T01:52:24.185+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.giphy.com/QwH7v7J1tBrq0.gif\n\nIt sounds like one of two things might be going on here: either your client is attempting to make a connection with our game servers at that point and it simply can't for some reason, or your OS isn't quite recognizing League as a safe program and won't let it fully load.\n\nI know you've been through the steps, but for curiosities sake let's make sure to go through those steps one more time. Pay close attention to port forwarding but be sure to hit each step and test it in a custom game to avoid any penalties from d/c's.\n\nIf that doesn't help, let's also double check that your [**permissions**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) are still setup correctly so that your OS doesn't think League isn't safe. Let me know how all of this goes!","replies":[]}]}
