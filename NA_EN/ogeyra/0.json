I install the game to my secondary HDD (SSD for my OS), and launch the application.  Game downloads and installs.  I'm able to go through champion select.  Afterwards, the icon appears in my taskbar, but no window appears even after 10+ minutes of waiting.  I've tried using the Hextech Repair Tool, but it didn't affect anything to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nSomeone please help, I gotta get some ARAMs in :(","replies":[{"poster":"Qiyano Reeves","date":"2017-08-06T06:49:42.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Check your router settings to if you can.

I recommend going over the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide instead to clear up any blocks and instability that's causing this issue.

I've also uninstalled League from the HDD and added it to my SSD so that it would be in its default directory, but it still doesn't appear to work.

This freezing has been known to happen to some players after updating Windows 10.  Specifically, the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) seems to auto-enable, which can cause this.  Disabling it should fix this up, but it&#x27;s really important you test that in a custom game.\n\nAlso worth mentioning try updating drivers in the GeForce Experience app.","replies":[{"poster":"oGeyra","date":"2017-08-05T22:18:12.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you!
