The changes to his ultimate didn't actually improve him much. They gave him a much worse early game and a slightly better late game, depending on how many champions you feast on. He needs a larger scope rework. \n\nTo counter Cho, especially tank cho, all you have to do is let him waste his ultimate on a minion and all-in him. He will lose every single time. Remember he only has a single target for feast, more than likely he will wait to use it on a champion. Wait till he uses it and then punish him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mountain Warden","date":"2017-03-03T17:43:38.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So how's his damage?
