Varus and MF give no shits about crit whatsoever (hell, MF is still building armor pen even after it was nerfed so hard), and Lucian is now beaten out by Urgot for ADC winrates because crit is so bad on him. Hell, Jhin is probably balanced for the first time in a long time just because he's forced into crit now instead of building something that's actually good on him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"agbudar","date":"2016-11-25T20:45:14.638+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"its ok their support bought {{item:3190}} {{item:3109}}{{item:3401}}  so they get to live through an assasin burst if they play right.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2016-11-25T21:13:20.216+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course, you could also live through the assassin's burst as Jinx/Cait, then actually do damage afterwards because crit actually means something to you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-11-25T21:52:29.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as someone who only played jhin cait and occasionally ashe kalista for my adc pick, im kinda happy i dont see anymore ar pen MFs or lucs","replies":[]},{"poster":"M Dragon14","date":"2016-11-25T21:19:26.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meh, I'm indifferent. Varus + Graves didn't really do that well with it, at least not bottom lane. I feel Varus is much better off now since the likes of Lucian and Jhin are less powerful. As for Lucian, MF, and Jhin.... Lucian feels bad compared to Cait, Twitch, and Vayne. MF feels similar, but better off than Lucian imo. Jhin still feels viable, but much weaker than he was (which is good, he needed a nerf).\n\nIdk about Draven. Haven't really played him much. He seemed okay, about in the same place as before. Could be wrong though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZED G0D","date":"2016-11-25T21:13:23.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:236}} here.\n\nThe {{item:3142}} losing its attackspeed really is a bummer.. since on lucian I dont build a lot of attack speed..but atleast I still have the move speed to assist my ult.\n\nMy full lucian build is usually\n\n{{item:3142}} > {{item:3071}}  > {{item:3158}} > (SITUATIONAL ITEM, If im ahead {{item:3046}}, if im behind I build defensive to whoever is my biggest threat..{{item:3026}} or {{item:3156}}) > {{item:3094}} {{item:3026}} ...

MF is the only one who still viably builds lethality items. She and Jhin are probably close to balanced, which is only because they were strong enough to take a hefty hit.\n\nVarus and Lucian both suck massive dick right now because they're forced into crit. Draven is average-mediocre, but he was generally average-mediocre before, so that's nothing new. Graves didn't really build much armor penetration outside of maw as a jungler, so he's not really affected by the changes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Truly Prideful","date":"2016-11-25T20:50:29.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fine because I still built crit on Jhin even while the pen build was FotM.  MF doesn't feel bad to build crit on, her attack speed steroid has a low enough cooldown that she can get away with not building a lot of attack speed so she can get more raw AD.
