Sure, there are some systems changes that could help, like working on creep block and stuff. But I think that the real way that ADCs stop being mandatory, or at least mandatory in the bot lane, is reworks to both ADCs and Supports.\n\nLets look at something interesting:\nFour of the six champions that were reworked as part of the Marksman update are now four ADCs who are pickable outside of the bot lane ADC role:\nGraves - Jungle\nQuinn - Top\nCorki - Mid\nMF -  Support (I know this is a niche pick but stick with me here)\n\nWhat's evident here is that when ADCs are changed to have unique reasons to pick them outside of just sustained physical damage, they become viable in other roles, because there are now reasons to pick them there. What other ADCs get picked outside of bot, and for what reasons? (not counting AP builds here)\n\nVayne - top - tank killing\nVarus - mid - supreme physical damage poke, counter-engage\nTwitch - jungle - stealth cheese ganks, later teamfight AoE\n\nIn addition to these, you have one champion, Kennen, who isn't an ADC but is occasionally picked as one because he brings something unique for the role - consistent, often AoE hard CC.\n\nSo if its possible to have your team's source of sustained ranged physical damage come from outside the bot lane, why is the bot lane still always an ADC?\n\nI think the real problem is the supports.\n\nThink about it for a second - almost every dedicated support is built around either enhancing specifically the patterns of a ranged ADC (Janna's shield gives AD, Sona Q gives an on-hit, Braum passive procs on autoattacks) or stopping the patterns of a diver or assassin (Lulu W/R, Janna Q/R, Soraka W). I think the problem with botlane might not be that theres no one who can replace an ADC, or that the mandatory ADC can't go anywhere else, but that there are no good lane partners for a non-ADC bot laner, and that any support you'll play against is specifically designed to fuck you over.\n\nThis might be entirely wrong but think about it a bit.","replies":[{"poster":"Spice POWAH","date":"2016-12-24T02:57:42.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why don't they just make it easier to farm against ranged champs?","replies":[{"poster":"Anonagon","date":"2016-12-24T03:12:41.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any systemic changes I would support for changing the botlane meta would be geared towards that.

There is no class in the game that can take towers like a Marksman can and let's be honest, taking towers is what wins the game.  Kills help, cs helps, neutral objectives help, but ultimately the game is decided by who takes the other team's towers because only taking towers allows you to destroy the nexus.\n\nThe only way that marksmen will ever not be in meta is if Riot introduced alternative ways to take towers (like zzrot and banner) or changed how other classes did damage to towers (like how mages deal AP damage to towers now.)  That is the first step to alter the meta, not nerfing marksmen or buffing other classes or reworking champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Profirix","date":"2016-12-24T16:39:52.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bring back marksmen mid.","replies":[]}]}
