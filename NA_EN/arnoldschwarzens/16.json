A lot of these angry posts are written by people who actually have a lot of game knowledge and valid concerns at their core, they are just presented in such an inappropriate manner that they are most likely not going to change anything anyway.\n\nImagine you are a dev, you work on the game full-time, do your best to make everything balanced and are eager to hear the community&#039;s concerns and to improve yourself. Instead of good advise on how to do that, everyone just tells you to fuck off and that everything you do is bad. Would you really listen to someone who does that? Who just cries at you and makes a scapegoat out of you instead of actually trying to help you with your job and giving you valid feedback?\n\nThe truth is, if any of the people who write these angry shitposts would somehow actually be hired to become a gameplay dev, after they did some changes they would most likely get exactly the same shitposts as a response, about how bad their changes are, how they don&#039;t know anything about the game and how they don&#039;t care about the community.\n\nIf you really want the devs to listen, be nice, do your research and be constructive.

It’s a lot harder to justify taking an argument seriously when it doesn’t feel like the other party is doing so. \n\nI don’t think that’s a super great thing for us to do - as I said, just because someone writes an angry post doesn’t negate their point, but the truth is that digging through vitriol to find the nugget of good feedback can be challenging or emotionally draining.

If you write a super long post and someone instantly scans it and downvotes it, it's less likely to rise and less likely to be seen by anyone, Riot included. I'm not sure exactly what the solution is here - if we as a community need be more aggressive about promoting thoughtful discussion over knee-jerk reactions, or if this an issue with the boards that Riot needs to try and solve. \n\nIt's probably a bit of both?\n\nThanks for posting, this is actually really good feedback.","replies":[{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2017-03-16T15:12:06.035+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":">If Riot wants to reduce toxicity and backlash from the community, you really ought to open more lines, and consistent lines, of communication with us. \n\nThat also means stop hiding on the policed League Reddit where criticism is more often than not filtered out because it's deemed \"anti-Riot\" to make way for more esports drama and pro montages when the front page isn't just exclusively  LCS vomit from the games that day. \n\nPart of the reason Boards are so vitriolic, as has been mentioned throughout this thread, and I am guilty of this as well,  is that it's the only way it gets attention.  I could make an eloquent and thought-provoking post challenging Riot's philosophy, but it's not going to get anywhere for two reasons: 1, I'm honestly a cynical, grudge-bearing prick and have been my whole life so there's a lack of ability  from the start, and 2, because I'm pretty sure I'm not a well-known poster, it's going to be drowned out by everyone else, so it's a wasted effort. \n\nAnother contributing factor is that every year, Riot claims they'll do better at communicating, and if they meant what they said and actually followed through with being more transparent than each previous year, by now we should have a live video feed of their department meetings.  Each year, the same exact thing happens - they make a copy-pasted apology for brick walling us, spend the first few months talking, then abandon ship and hardly ever show up again.  Every. Single. Year.  Y'know where they _do_ appear?  Reddit, and why wouldn't they?  It's a cesspool of esports spam and positivity because the mods hate it when people speak out against the benevolent rulers.  Anyone remember the East Coast servers movement where threads were being auto-deleted because they were \"being an inconvenience to Riot?\" \n\n\nMaybe the real League forums (us, not Reddit) wouldn't be such a toxic place if there was communication when some fuck-up or apparent careless balancing happens so Riot can see the other side of their perspective.  The issue with this is the white knights who's only purpose is to sprint to the rescue and cry away the \"salty haters\" who dare talk back to the reds.  Currently, there's less of it, but there was a long period between the end of season 5 and all throughout 6 where Riot seemed to _only_ listen to positive comments and praise, seeming to value \"HAW HAW I LUV U RITO HAVE MUH BABBYZ!\" over someone challenging their direction on an addition or change, where it's instantly brushed aside and ignored. For a recent example, remember Duskblade's announcement, and the thread was filled with warnings that giving a mini Zed ult to everyone was a terrible idea on top of the danger of ranged champions abusing it?  Gee, it's a good thing they were wro-...oh wait. \n\nThe final part of this expands on the last paragraph; that people will too often associate a challenge with hate, since it's often difficult to match a tone with text when it's going against something, automatically making it negative.  Yesterday, Ghostcrawler answered some questions in a GDC topic, and again, people associate me challenging Riot's ideology with just senseless hate.  A similar thing happened [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/BXOezvo6-explain-yourself-riot?comment=0019) where he was describing Riot's hesitance on 10 bans, and I challenged him, and one of the first responses to that was \"aw shit someone just smited riot\" ...that...that wasn't the intent...but if everything going against Riot is seen as doing it out of hate or spite, then people need to stop being so damn sensitive, especially the boot lickers shielding Reds from any and all criticism.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Calad","date":"2017-03-16T16:30:48.438+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"I just flat-out disagree with you about the League subreddit not being critical.

I’m not sure the champion update team would agree with you. [Here’s why the team decided to focus on Galio.](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/champion-update/state-champion-update)\n\n“Currently Galio has a lot of problems. His theme, gameplay, and art hasn’t aged very well at all. This gives us a pretty wide canvas to paint on and Galio will likely be our largest transformation to date. So what are our goals with Galio? With Galio we want to see if we can really deliver on a mid lane focused tank/mage , as we think that opens up a lot of interesting strategies (not that he has to be played exclusively mid of course).”\n\nI think that if we’d decided to prioritize Morde instead of Galio, there would be plenty of players asking “Why is another Morde rework more important than a Galio rework?!” In this case, I trust the Champion Update team to determine their priorities. \n> [{quoted}](name=Arkadije95,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=T2JNb3cm,comment-id=002d0001000000010000000000000002,timestamp=2017-03-16T17:40:05.143+0000)\n>\n> Why Vanguard update instead of Diver update?\n\n[Reav3 goes into why we decided to focus on Vanguards here. ](http://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/2017/01/dev-state-of-champion-update-january-2017/)\n\n“As for unique identities, our Vanguards in particular are currently very similar to each other. They all are basically different versions of Amumu—they go in, do some AOE CC, then stand around doing ambient damage to the enemy team. One of our major goals will be to make the Vanguards we rework break this mold in new and exciting ways. We also want to take a real hard look at defensive items and how the entire roster (both tanks and non-tanks) engages with them. We want tanks to get a much greater benefit from tank items than other classes, so they can correctly play the role of being the tankiest champions in the game.”\n\n[And there's a little conversation about why Vanguards instead of Divers on reddit here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/5ra6s4/state_of_champion_update_january_2017/dd5lon0/)\n\nWe’re still planning to work on Divers in the future. Something has to come first, and in this case, the team decided to prioritize Vanguards because they felt that Tank items are in need of a update. And those items have the potential to affect Divers as well, so it makes sense to me to work on Tanks first and then Divers.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Arkadije95,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=T2JNb3cm,comment-id=002d0001000000010000000000000002,timestamp=2017-03-16T17:40:05.143+0000)\n>\n> Oh and if you care about your community then why did you not listen to people on the PBE saying that Aatrox changes suck?\n\nBalance is tricky. An hour of live gameplay gives us so much more data than we get internally, or from PBE. Ultimately, you have to try and balance a lot of different factors, get as close as you can, and react to how things land. In Aatrox’s case, he came out pretty weak, and [we even pushed a hotfix for him](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/Qa21ePAW-quick-gameplay-thoughts-march-9), rather than try and keep him waiting a full patch cycle.\n\n\"Aatrox looks like he's almost certainly too weak by a noticeable margin. We're looking at possible buffs, with a decent chance we hotfix at least some of them out. We would expect Aatrox to struggle somewhat as players adapt to new builds, the changed passive etc, it looks like his kit's just too weak as well though.\"\n\nWe will never get to a state where we can perfectly predict how balanced a change will be. Sometimes we will be right and sometimes we will be wrong. I think the more important thing is that we admit when we're wrong and try and make changes things quickly, which I feel we did here. \n\n> [{quoted}](name=Arkadije95,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=T2JNb3cm,comment-id=002d0001000000010000000000000002,timestamp=2017-03-16T17:40:05.143+0000)\n>\n> I know this will probably be ignored, cuz who cares what a Silver shitlord like me says anyway, but fuck it, somebody should say it.\n\nEnjoy!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2017-03-16T16:54:47.339+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand, as do most companies, but it appears that you prioritize Reddit, that's what I'm getting at.

Riot Tantram smiting people is one form of visibility, but that happens ever so often and smiting people really isn't what Riot wants to do. \n\nMeddler's Dev blogs are great for us to have gameplay visibility and get into the thoughts of the developers, and I understand that taking time to post those things will take time away from working on features, but I still think that have SOME visibility is better than none. Even if it is just a monthly thing, and they come out and say \"all our developers are working on the new client right now\", it's better than nothing. At least we get to know they've seen our concerns.\n\n[I've voiced my concerns on the new Honor system](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/gffOaYFP-discussion-honor-system-coming), because they are so hush hush about it, I really feel that it won't solve toxicity problems and unless they release more info about it, we won't know if it is in the right direction to solve toxicity and promote better sportsmanship.\n\nI would think it'll be better to give us glimpse of it (maybe at least talk about the problem space and goals they are trying to achieve), instead of trying to be super hush hush and then come out with a \"SUPER COOL PROMO !!

A lot of posts get upvoted not only because it appeals to emotion, but because vague leaves less to disagree and specific leaves a lot to disagree with. In turn, the post gets buried and never seen.\n\n\nA very simple example would be a post saying healing and shielding is overtuned\n\nSaying that healing and shielding is OP and leaving with an insult to Riot doesn't insult anyone but Riot so very few people would downvote.\n\nSaying that healing and shielding can be potentially OP because Redemption did ridiculously large amounts at early levels, and was made to compete with damage which is already off the charts from power creep, and that it should be nerfed because when damage creep is finally addressed it'll lead to ridiculously broken amounts of damage mitigation leaves a lot of points to disagree with. People will downvote out of impulse and a knee-jerk reaction to the idea that an item they like is OP, that damage creep is a problem when they like oneshotting, or that a meta revolving around redemption would be bad.\n\nWhat's even worse is peer pressure that no one likes to admit to, a -1 post is likely to go to -10, rather than back to 1 or even 0. People who would agree to the post end up not voting and asking themselves what *they* missed that makes everyone downvote, rather than upvoting because they agree.\n\nThe solution would be to remove the upvote downvote system, or to change it somehow to allow people to agree to varying degrees. Maybe each paragraph has its own scoring? Even then I'd make the numbers hidden and definitely not visible at least until after the upvote or downvote has been given. More importantly there needs to be a sort of nudge or encouragement to go through the entire post, and upvote for agreeing with a few things, not downvote for disagreeing with a few things.\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aeszarck","date":"2017-03-16T03:22:05.590+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am replying to this so I can more easily reference this in the future.

However, I don't think this is something that the userbase here will simply understand and adapt to, because Gameplay's toxicity comes from its very structure. One of the reasons shitposts are so popular, for example, is because they often get upvoted a ton, whereas more constructive posts, especially posts that make suggestions, get downvoted into obscurity before they get a real chance, simply because one or a few people saw the thread and instinctively disagreed with one thing that was said out of many. On top of this, the Gameplay boards are so poorly curated and moderated that there is very little overall quality control, allowing the cheap, easy and useless posts to overtake the more thoughtful ones. Riot's general lack of participation may be a result of Gameplay's toxic atmosphere, but it's also a vicious cycle, since the lack of communication on here simply generates more frustration overall.\n\nThe thing is, while the OP is excellent and useful, this is not the first time a thread like this has been made. If you simply tell Gameplay they're being toxic and that they need to change, they're not going to care, not just because they likely know already, but because their toxicity comes from improper incentives and moderation: with its current structure, Gameplay is pushing people to make low-effort posts, and away from constructive discussion, and if that doesn't change, the boards will not change. This is obviously not what Riot intended, but it's also something their forum team has made no real effort to rectify in all these years. It's silly, because it's also likely what caused Riot's communication channels to move to everywhere _but_ Gameplay: we now have a Dev Corner where only Rioters can post, the Nexus feed where the devs mostly talk _at_ the playerbase, rather than _with_ them, and then we have Reddit and ask.fm, which allow for two-way communication, but are unaffiliated with League's official site and tend to lead to only sporadic dev interaction. Riot should have a vested interest in bringing Gameplay up to far better standards, as it would allow them to centralize a lot of their communications, and achieve a much more useful and functional level of interaction with their players, while collecting much higher-quality feedback.","replies":[{"poster":"Xonra","date":"2017-03-15T22:10:59.916+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"IT won't ever be as productive because despite how some of the people in this thread are mocking it, they are the SAME - EXACT - PEOPLE I see upvoting and commenting in the negative circlejerks, but will completely ignore and won't even comment in the positive threads. \n\nThat is why gameplay looks so negative, because people ignore anything BUT the negative, because they want to be able to have their \"oh gameplay is just bitching\" circlejerks, while bitching...about the bitching circlejerks <_<","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZILLAGULA","date":"2017-03-15T14:06:14.025+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well tbh I'm trying to reach out the game's players for them to relate not so much to the game devs. I think by winning over a portion of the community there's also going to be a larger chance of me making a change.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-03-15T14:07:27.670+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"So mob mentality?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2017-03-16T13:45:19.426+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the real joke here is the OP's name and how it totally fits the topic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Prison AnaI","date":"2017-03-16T17:33:50.668+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes i agree with Mr. Freehorseporn","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xyntheyxz","date":"2017-03-16T13:14:10.496+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im pretty sure the real reason is because Memes are ALWAYS superior.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Draclen","date":"2017-03-15T15:59:19.786+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Definitely agree.
