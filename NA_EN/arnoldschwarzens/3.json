Then everyone can make fun of them, point, laugh and have a good time. Then the assassin player goes and complains about  bullying, but that just makes it worse so they take a vacation trip to Spain to cool off. The problem is the Gypsies steal their wallet and all identification so they have to go to their national embassy to get help. Along the way they get robbed and when they wake up they are sitting in an ice bath with a fresh scar and bandage where one of their kidneys has been removed. Thankfully the black market surgeon used quality anesthesia and sterile equipment so they didn't develop any infections or serious pain. So they hit the road to the embassy again and this time they make it. A generic government stooge helps them get replacement documents and plane tickets back home. There is a layover in Colombia so when they get back to the US they get flagged for a full drug search when one of the dogs false alerts. After the painful search that resulted in some funny walking, they head home and lay down in bed for a nap. Then they wake up and go back to playing League because it's still better than Gypsies and Black Market organ theft.  \n\n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"bistroh","date":"2016-12-13T22:32:24.874+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":0,"body":"What the fuck","replies":[]},{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2016-12-13T22:19:21.352+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's the point of this post?\nNo really, I am sitting on my wires, didn't have sleep for more than day and have to study hard for tomorrow's exam from databases from which I know nothing.\nCan somebody explain me what he said in fatiguetongue?","replies":[{"poster":"Papa Andrei","date":"2016-12-13T22:56:53.708+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"League is better than having your kidney stolen","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2016-12-13T23:00:38.987+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh...
