There are so much new things to test, with so much things changing and the lack of a pro scene the Meta won&#039;t be defined for several months and for that time we can mostly do whatever the fuck we want.\n\nFor me as someone who loves this game mainly for theorycrafting and testing new builds, jungle routes etc. in-game, the preseason is basically heaven. There are so much new things to try and if they actually work, you feel much smarter than you actually are.\n\nTo everyone who is reading this, just try to have fun for once while playing with the new changes. If you go into the game with the attitude that everything new sucks without even testing it, of course you&#039;re not going to have fun with the preseason.","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2016-11-02T22:59:59.857+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm just sad about the removal of SotA\n\nAssassins are on the rise though so my Morde mid might just become his primary role","replies":[{"poster":"ArnoldSchwarzens","date":"2016-11-02T23:08:41.477+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":7,"body":"Never really liked SotA.

If you clear Krugs and Red after, you will be level 3 and able invade the enemy blue side jungle before he hits level 3 and cheese kill him at his wolves, if he goes for a full clear. Or you can cheese gank mid when both midlaners are level 2 while you are 3. Most junglers need a long time to clear krugs but Shaco got his boxes which makes it much easier for him.\n\nThere's also a new peenetration/CDR build I want to test. Since you already get artificial crits from your new backstab passive and because you don't scale as much with attack speed anymore, going for this build seems much more worth it to me.\n\nIt's CDR Boots, Skirmisher's - Warrior, Youmuu's, Duskblade, Ravenous Hydra and a defensive item like Edge of Night, GA or Dead Man's to top it off.\n\nThe combination of his Q on-hit + Duskblade on-hit + backstab crit + Hydra + E will make for some hilarious oneshots on squishies.\n\nThen there's the AP build. While I don't know if it's able to jungle properly but it's probably going to be hilarious in the top-and midlane. His Q now has an AP ratio and the duration of boxes now also scales with AP - on top of the clone now also dropping a triangle of boxes, who have an AP scaling on their own. If the new control wards wouldn't be a thing, I feel like this new AP Shaco would be extremely strong.","replies":[]}]}]}
