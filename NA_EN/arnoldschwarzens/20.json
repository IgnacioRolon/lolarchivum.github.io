No, they actually thought about it long and hard before coming to the conclusion that it&#039;s a good pick.

I genuinely believe that the concept of the build, although it doesn't utilize or optimize the items in its fullest it does still have its own means of effect.\n\nI could run Rylais on Garen (and have) and find a use out of it from a single effect. Not all players just try something to try it or because it's a flavor of the month. And there's far worse the player could've done.
