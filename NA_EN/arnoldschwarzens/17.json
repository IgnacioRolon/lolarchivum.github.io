His  numbers and weird scalings would make you believe that he either would be an AD bruiser in the jungle or toplane or an AP Assassin.\r\n\r\nHis Q and ultimate have extremely high AP ratios and base damage, his Q has up to 300 magic damage with a 100% AP ratio and his ult has 500 base damage with another 100% AP ratio. If you look at the kit of your average mage or AP assassin this just seems HUGE even though in reality playing AP Blitzcrank comes close to just trolling.\r\n\r\nThen there&#039;s something even weirder about him, his W not only gives him movement speed as everyone knows it also gives him . . . ATTACK SPEED? Wut? And his E is not like a Leona Q where it has a base damage plus an AP ratio, it&#039;s actually just 100% of your AD as bonus physical damage and it stays at that value, since it doesn&#039;t even scale with level, the only thing that really happens is just his cooldown going down with rank. Yet again, if I would never have seen it in game, I would probably play an auto-attack based AD bruiser version of him in the toplane or in the jungle with stuff like Trinity Force, Hydra or maybe even a Manamune build for his passive. And yet again, doing this kind of thing comes really fucking close to trolling when it comes to what it actually is like in-game.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not even complaining - all these weird abilities and mix of ratios and scaling somehow makes him work as a support and not as what Riot probably intended him to be when they created him back in Beta or Alpha or whenever that was. As long as he&#039;s not either underpowered or overpowered I&#039;m fine with where he is, it&#039;s just so freaking weird when you realize that THIS works.","replies":[{"poster":"Kaisa is Hot","date":"2017-01-03T14:21:32.015+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm pretty sure his original design was an AD bruiser.
