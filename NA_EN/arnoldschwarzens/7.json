A monstrosity that is unpleasant to look at, suffering unbelievable pain and the only thing to keep it going is what made him so scary when he was alive - his hate for everything around him.\n\nI like to draw parallels between him and the Mountain from Game of Thrones. Both were raised to kill which made their psychic state so fucked up to the point that the only pleasure they get is from violence and sadistic tendencies ( and a little rape here and there but we gotta keep it pegi 12 ). Because of their background they never were able to feel affection for another person or got any to begin with which made them even more insane. They are unloved beings who were exploited to be living killing machines for all their life which may also make you feel sorry for them, at least if you forget the atrocities they caused for a second.\n\nBoth almost got released from their undesirable existence until the ruthlessness of their rulers revived them to be a living weapon once more, this time quite literally. The Mountain is now terrifiying to look at but Urgot takes it to another level. He is not only a reanimated corpse, his fat upper body is exposed and there are all kinds of machinery worked into his skin. His lower body is spider-like which triggers arochnophobia, which is a good thing considering his character.\n\nOn top of that, Urgot does not only feel psychic but also physical pain now and his violent tendencies and his goal for revenge will have to make up for that now too, especially since his body won&#039;t allow him to feel pleasure from eating, sex and other human pass times anymore, and if someone were to befriend him before he was reanimated, he or she definitely won&#039;t do it now. He is kind of the perfect evil character - he does and did things that are obviously wrong and his looks just makes you want to puke but his background makes his actions almost understandable and you could see yourself acting like him in his position.\n\nThere is also some controversy on why he&#039;s fat, since he was described as a terrifying warrior which would make you look more like a bulky giant that is packed with trained muscles instead of a fat person. I personally thinks it makes sense because he spent the last years before his &quot;death&quot; as a crippled executioner rather than the warrior he once was. Also we got that kind of look already covered by Sion.\n\nHis kit is outdated, I&#039;m going to agree with that but I think he looks like he should look, except for maybe a few tweaks.\n\nI was also kind of disappointed with Yorick&#039;s new look, his good looking face and lack of humpback. I think they could have done everything they did with him in his rework but they should have left these two features at least, because he too is a champion that would suit his lore better if he was ugly, even with the remade lore. Makes me scared of what they&#039;re going to do with Urgot, which is why I made this post.\n\nLet me know if you agree.","replies":[{"poster":"Trolosaurus","date":"2016-08-24T16:32:10.062+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":5,"body":"I agree with this post, but no on Yorick.

His character has so much going for it story wise, but visually it's so poorly conveyed as to what he is, simply because his character is massively overshadowed by just how ugly he is. I feel like he should become much more Techmaturgy / Cyborg related in his update, if not to convey his gameplay themes, but to allow for more depth in story than just \"ugly abomination of tech-magic gone wrong\" His absolute lust for revenge and his almost pure sadist mindset are such strong character personality traits, but it shouldn't be all based on just him being \"ugly\".\n\nHis Battlecast skin is much more to how Urgot feels as a character than any of his other skins or visuals, in that he has this pitch black armor with glowing and sparking potrusions on his body. The dark armor really gives him a menacing and evil feel, and the bright green accents allow the skin to convey a sickening and twisted feeling. Being ugly doesn't really show much more beyond that his character, on a surface level, is deformed. It would be so much more poignant to allow him to look not human, but still retain his evil, menacing and sadistic personality, especially through gameplay and visuals.\n\nJust my two cents","replies":[]},{"poster":"WhiskerWow","date":"2016-08-25T04:01:28.182+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Although a lot of people dislike the prettiness of the new Yorick, I do not think Riot has that a big stance against ugly characters, if we look to Sion as an example.
