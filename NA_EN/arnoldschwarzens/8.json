{"poster":"ArnoldSchwarzens","date":"2016-06-17T20:56:13.367+0000","title":"The Alternative Option . . . League's Hottest Males?","subforum":"Memes & Games","up_votes":29,"down_votes":3,"body":"Thought of it after reading this: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/memes/U856fHiF-who-do-you-consider-leagues-best-girl-i-know-what-it-makes-me-sound-like-but-im-curious\n\nWhile there are definitely more female characters that are considered to be attractive, there are also a lot of male champions who are attractive for the opposite gender and gaymers too. Of course most of us are straight males, so in this case don&#039;t vote, unless  you&#039;d actually go full homo just to try it some time.\n\nWhile the other list had problems with having too little spots for all the top grills, it occured to me that there much fewer male champions who are considered to be attractive by the female and gay community. So there are going to be a lot of questionable filler champions. Also, please vote honestly, not based on memes or to try to be funny ( Taric, Ezreal, Graggy).\n\nI&#039;m listing champions based on what women tend to find attracive in men, at least as far as I know. I could list pure bs as far as I&#039;m concerned, since I actually honestly have not that great of an idea of what actually is attractive, because as I said, I&#039;m straight.\n\nMy criteria for champions that are listed here vary from champion to champion. There&#039;s the masculinity aspect that you can find in Graves and TF, champions that have high self-esteem and/or a cool/badass personality like Yasuo, Lucian and yet again Graves and TF, and then there&#039;s the champions who are less masculine with round shaved faces who are getting more and more attractive these days, for example Ezreal or Varus. I personally expect Graves or Varus to win.\n\n**EDIT 1:**\nSo, apperantly you can't edit polls, which is a shame. Totally forgot about Talon, so basically treat Lucian as being Talon. Another thing I want to note is that this list does include skins, so sandstorm Ekko and Heartseeker Varus are definitely options.\n\nLooking from what the results are so far, I imagined Gragas to have far less votes, basically just included him to see how much people can think he's even remotely attractive. Probably just trollvotes though. On the other hand I expected Lucian to have more votes, with his lore, voice, personality and looks. What a shame, now he's out of the list.","replies":[{"poster":"Volgorath","date":"2016-06-17T23:12:19.783+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":1,"body":"Where is the most manliest option? {{champion:201}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:201}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"AÃ­r","date":"2016-06-17T21:43:29.584+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":2,"body":"The hottest guy is obviously {{champion:63}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"HadesBlades","date":"2016-06-18T01:18:55.547+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"I might love Katarina in the female section but im feeling rejected that there is no Talon here ;-;","replies":[{"poster":"Final Remnant ","date":"2016-06-18T05:39:52.322+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow I just made a rant about there not being an option for Talon, you all have great taste! xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ArnoldSchwarzens","date":"2016-06-18T02:09:04.855+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, thinking about taking Ekko out for Talon.

If I had to pick from the list you provided then I'd go for Yasuo, and Ezreal is pretty cute as well. I think Ekko is cute but only in his Sandstorm outfit, in his base outfit and appearance he looks like of meh. Ah hell, I'll admit most of those champions are pretty attractive to degree. \n\nI don't care for the whole TF and Graves masculine/cowboy stereotype look, though some people find those qualities attractive, especially the country/cowboy/western voice and appearance. So my top five would probably be \n\n1. Talon \n2. Yasuo \n3. Ezreal \n4. Jayce \n5. SANDSTORM VERSION of Ekko \n\n(I still can't believe you don't even consider Talon, what is wrong with you?

It's pretty obvious he is super attractive and he has a toned/well built body on top of all that, also he can pull off long hair.)\n\nI'm probably just a sucker for anime looking guys xD\n\nhttp://orig09.deviantart.net/1f62/f/2014/020/3/6/dragonblade_talon_by_markou000-d732snu.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Full AP Venusaur","date":"2016-06-18T00:40:12.821+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lee Sin for his sexy confidence and charm","replies":[{"poster":"a w1ld bulbasaur","date":"2016-06-18T00:50:10.459+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have found my evolution.","replies":[{"poster":"CasterGilgamesh","date":"2016-06-18T01:29:02.643+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":": o\n\nhttp://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/007/582/tumblr_lmputme3co1qa6q7k_large.png","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Fox Byte","date":"2016-06-18T16:51:01.059+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:91}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:91}} \n\nPlease! <3","replies":[]},{"poster":"LightIsMyPath","date":"2016-06-18T12:12:52.421+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where is talon??
