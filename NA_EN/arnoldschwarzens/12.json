Always had the most fun with showing people that really outlandish shit can work, was a Sion main before his rework, both AP and AD, also a Taric main with his mana-scaling on-hit passive and an according build or AP Taric, later with his armor scaling on-hit passive, both before his rework. They always were not only really fun builds but also actually viable and often caught people off-guard.\n\nNow I feel like I can't do this as much anymore. Non-Meta champions seem to always underperform and even if they turn out to be decent, trying to learn new champions in a Meta were one single fuck-up will mean that you will have a really bad experience just makes it much harder than before - not that I could do anything about the Meta though. Kinda tired of having to pick Darius all the time.\n\nI've also been maining jungle and toplane for the last few seasons but they are just unrecognizable at this point, they've changed so much over the years and aren't the lanes I grew to love anymore.\n\nLastly, frustration in general. The game isn't as casual as it used to be, if you don't tryhard and handle all the pressure that you have to deal with these days it's just really hard to have a fun experience. In general, the pace of the game and how unforgiving it is right now is just hard to deal with to the point where it's just really bad for my mental health because they are almost as stressful as work. But yet again, can't really directly change the game itself, right.\n\nJust posting this so that I somehow might find a way to cope with what the game is right now. I grew to love it and have invested a lot of time and money into it, I want to somehow have fun with it again instead of just quitting it after all these years.","replies":[{"poster":"Randomonium","date":"2017-01-18T16:10:55.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd agree that the game is more try hard now because everyone's skill is getting higher and higher. What is \"silver skill\" now was probably closer to \"gold skill\" in earlier seasons. This is just the natural progression of games. At first everything is random because no one knows how to play and over the course of a couple years people begin to figure out the best strategies.\n\nYou can still have fun with off meta builds, you just need good fundamentals to make them work. If you cs well and understand map novement you can beat people even if your build is \"sub For example, I recently played quite a bit of attack speed on hit lulu top lane and had a blast with it. However, some builds are never going to be viable so you do need to be more selective.\n\nIf you're looking for casual definitely stick with normal games or ARAMS. If someone flames you for playing something off meta just laugh at them and mute them.\n\nAnother thing you can do to find a community that has the same priorities as you. I'm sure there are tons of clubs that love to play off meta stuff. Some of my best experiences have been doing stupid stuff in normals while we make fun of each other in discord.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2017-01-18T12:46:17.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fuck.\nThe.\nMeta.\n\nPlay some full AD Sion Top. \nPlay some full AD Sion Jungle.\nPlay some full AD Sion mid.\nPlay some full AD Sion ADC.\n\nI've done it all.\nIf you enjoy fun builds, use some fun builds.\nMute whoever flames you for it and have some casual ass fucking fun :^)\nI'd suggest you play with some friends, that's what I do whenever I play dumb shit like that","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"dominusx","date":"2017-01-18T12:29:24.681+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"stop playing. that's it.\n\n-Meta is stupid and too enforced\n-Meta champs are all boring\n-Only 2 viable strategies to win aka 5man bot or snowball a single lane so hard it gets out of control\n-Everything does too much dmg so no point picking anything that isnt a tank or a mage/adc i mean assasins are fucking useless for a reason.\n-Toxicity is still high\n Needless to say more.","replies":[{"poster":"Handy Sandy ","date":"2017-01-18T12:56:19.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dominusx,realm=EUNE,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=1TRA1yzw,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-01-18T12:29:24.681+0000)\n>\n> stop playing. that&#x27;s it.\n> \n> -Meta is stupid and too enforced\n> -Meta champs are all boring\n\nI play {{champion:268}} bot lane adc/apc and have been sucessful","replies":[{"poster":"Randomonium","date":"2017-01-18T15:35:26.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This actually sounds pretty fun in the right situations.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2017-01-18T12:58:03.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The current meta isn't very fun.\n\nPersonally, I'm taking a break and catching up on my Steam Backlog.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2017-01-18T12:55:16.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Take a break.\nPlay another game for a week, start a hobby, drink water and take walks. \n\nThe meta is currently dumb and highly enforced.","replies":[]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-01-18T12:34:49.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"switch to aram for a bit","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hethalean","date":"2017-01-18T12:22:33.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try not to be too worried if you win or lose the game.
