Singed... dunno, maybe he's still \"evil\", in a mad scientist way, it depends on how much he does for the sake of scienceTM and how much he revels in inflicting pain and suffering to the subjects of his experiments. Going back we had Renekton who's mad, Camille's brother who's manipulative and a bit childish but not really evil... I think Xerath is the only one who definitely does act for what I'd say is evil, but with a sensible reason (withouth being too sympatethic either).\nEDIT: I forgot about Gangplank!

Because Xerath is currently one of the most evil beings in the story regardless, and you guys said he is not that ''bad''. \n\nHe is that bad when he has sadistic pleasure for roasted flesh and bodies turned to ashes. He is nowhere close to redemption and without redemption, I don't know how you guys can end the Shurima except going full cliche like defeating the ultimate surprime being of all faction with muh magic, meh trick, meh power of love etc, an entity which actually had to be morally grey and closer to semi-purified from emotions.\n\nI really love Shurima story and It goes insanely well for me, but I'm worried about the ending, defeat of Xerath, which is cliche and nearly impossible according to my view.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2017-02-03T18:21:25.803+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"A slave can never be free until he kills his master.  \n\nKeep in mind Xerath is still in chains, physical and emotional.

He just wants to be left alone on his property. \n\nDraven isn't pure evil. its his JOB to kill people. he just does it with style.(he served in the Noxian army then later on became a executioner because he loves killing and putting on a show). Draven doesn't prey on innocent bystanders or anything.\n\nJinx causes widespread destruction and mayhem but rarely seems to actually hurt people (only robots).\n\nJhin might arguably be \"pure evil\" but personally I think he errs more on the side of insanity+ misunderstood.He is fully aware that what he is doing is wrong but he is absolutely powerless to stop himself. He probably actually wants Zed or Shen to finally stop him.\n\nTahm is Evil but he its more of a Faustian bargain so if you find yourself suffering by his hands you only have yourself to blame","replies":[]},{"poster":"LatetotheRace","date":"2017-02-02T05:39:30.775+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like the only Villain is {{champion:223}} \nA being of pure sin and lust.","replies":[{"poster":"TheBentOn3","date":"2017-02-02T23:55:53.688+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LatetotheRace,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=0XjEEk1a,comment-id=000f,timestamp=2017-02-02T05:39:30.775+0000)\n>\n> I feel like the only Villain is {{champion:223}} \n> A being of pure sin and lust.\n\nA gentleman of refined tastes.","replies":[{"poster":"LatetotheRace","date":"2017-02-03T00:06:58.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uh... yeah... suuure.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DoktorKaiser","date":"2017-02-02T15:34:39.718+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How is  {{champion:112}}  even a villain any more?
