I&#039;m fine with that, as long as I don&#039;t unnecessarily cost myself and my teammates elo points.\r\n\r\nRiot is already bringing Solo Que back and introducing a new seperate team ranked queue, which will already make games much more balanced because it removes the random factor of premades from the game. If the change described in the title will go through aswell, it would be even more balanced. And since you are changing ranked queues anyway, this change might aswell can go along with that.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-10-08T21:13:36.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It might already be doing this. I recall back when they were discussing how the New Champion Select works that if you play a different role than usual it would adjust your MMR depending on how well others in your main role perform when filling that one. I'm unsure if that's how it still works, as that's something Lyte put out before he left.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-10-08T20:38:23.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are bring back soloq? are they actually bringing it back or just saying they are like the last 2 times and then later randomly say they aren't going to do it and instead give some needless change to Diamond+ dynamic queue?","replies":[]}]}
