I think I got more than 100 upvotes on that post.\n\nWhat actually happened is that for the longest time it didn&#039;t make a difference just to turn out to be mostly a marksman item. No one ever talked about it again but I still felt like an idiot.\n\nSo I&#039;m going to post my Meta predictions down here and expect some of you guys to do the same. On every patch that will come after the Preseason, I will make a new post with a link that will refer back to this post to see how many of our predictions actually were true and how much of them will turn out to be bullshit.\n****\n**Penetration Marksmen Are Getting Nerfed:**\nRight now some caster marksmen like {{champion:236}} {{champion:202}}  and {{champion:21}}  are building penetration items in the early game, something like {{item:3142}} {{item:3147}} and {{item:3071}}, to enhance their ability damage and synergize with their high AD ratios. Since Youmuu&#039;s also gives attack speed and it helps an absolute ton in the early game since armor values are really low and the penetration build makes those diminishing return matter, these builds are outclassing early crit investment for these specific champions. They still invest in crit later on though, since that is still the best option for the late game, when the enemy has stacked enough armor through levels and items to negate the power of the early penetration investment.\n\nWith the upcoming changes, Youmuu&#039;s will lose out on its attack speed which matters more on marksmen than it does on assassins like {{champion:238}}  or {{champion:91}}  who never really made much use of it anyway. On top of that, the penetration marksmen now lose their early game snowballing and killing power that the old flat penetration items gave them, since the new lethality stat scales with the enemy level instead of giving you a high flat value. The new Duskblade is pretty shitty for all the caster marksmen since they don&#039;t have any special stealth interactions. They also don&#039;t make as much use of the extra out of combat movement speed as melee champions and assassins do, who spend much more time roaming and chasing to land a kill.\n\nThere&#039;s still the Essence Reaver build as an alternative and the new lethality items might still be better than I&#039;m expecting them to be, so maybe this won&#039;t make that much of a difference. We will have to wait and see.\n****\n**On-Hit Champions Are Getting Nerfed:**\nWith Guinsoo&#039;s and the old Kog being gone, on-hit has been pretty meh over the last few patches. I think it will become even more rough for them with the Fervor of Battle rework, now it will grant you AD per stack instead of extra on-hit damage. For champions who don&#039;t really have that much alternative keystones to pick, like {{champion:10}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:24}}  etc., this just seems like a straight out nerf, a pretty big one at that. A lot of champions can make better use of the new Fervor but for the champions I listed above, I predict that they are going to struggle a bit ( except for maybe Kayle, with everyone probably playing assassins in the preseason ).\n****\n**{{champion:6}}  Will Be Insane:**\nUrgot has always been really good when assassins were good, since he has always been hard to kill with his shield and the damage reduction on his ult and passive, combined with the ultimate that is able to immidiately shut down an assassin after he/she tries to kill someone. Not only that, his itemization is also getting a pretty huge buff - {{item:3110}}  gold cost gets lowered, {{item:3156}}  now gives CDR and extra AD when the shield pops and all the new lethality items like reworked {{item:3142}} and Edge of Night also seem pretty good on him since he always was a champion that builds a lot of penetration and prefers the mid-to lategame over the early game.\n\nIt&#039;ll be super hard to see if anything actually happens with him since there are only are a very few amount of people playing him and nobody really cares about him. Information on whether he is good or not will be super hard to gather. But with all the stuff happening that I just mentioned I can&#039;t see how he wouldn&#039;t become a god.\n****\nLet me know what you guys think and post your own predicitions below.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2016-11-03T20:55:42.665+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"i predict ADCs will be played in bot lane every game","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2016-11-04T05:08:34.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:44}} + {{champion:122}} will be the new meta of bot lane, i can feel it... mostly because I will be playing it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EcchiOtakuTM","date":"2016-11-04T00:47:24.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:107}}  (500 AD minimally) >:D\n\nSrsly hope riot realize bonetooth isn't the answer, I havn't seen even ONCE since release where rengar isn't broken  or held back by it...

New Rengar looks like he could pull off a hellacious bruiser build. Kha'zix evolution changes are cool but really don't fulfill the goal of providing choices (Still going to be a set pattern for nearly all situations).\n\n{{champion:55}} \nPicks are prob going to be a bunch of feeders / do horrible from the number of players used to her kit having a ridiculously low skill floor.

Other adcs will probably start trending towards those items to counter the upsurge in assassins  that will happen at the start of the season . Adcs will be posting complaint threads again due to be in the hell meta for adc.\n\n{{item:3026}} \nIs probably going to be changed.

They're generally good in assassin metas. \n\n{{item:3147}} {{item:3142}} \n\nAre going to probably fall out of marksman builds or at least the ghost blade will. Lethality doesn't become equivalent to current armor pen until something like level 8 for dirk, 18 for ghost blade, and is better for duskblade by the time you buy it. The loss of +atkspd on the ghostblade active makes it purely for the movespeed so it might still help out low mobility champs (Not nearly as attractive without the extra %atkspd and scaling time on 20 lethality).\n\nEdge of night is  going to be abused on anything that likes ad / lethality and is a heavy nerf to cc if it keeps being a 30s morgana spellshield with a small cast time. It will get nerfed or adjusted a lot.\n\nRedemption will quickly become annoying and sexy.\n\nKnights vow is going to be a rush item on {{champion:412}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:12}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:57}{{champion:89}}{{champion:57}}{{champion:111}}   and is going to be op if it is released how it is on pbe.\n\n{{champion:111}} \nMains of this champion are going to have a good time.

It only comes at an extremely small damage cost (2% max health damage on W at max rank). Kled is also actually one of the few current Fervor uses that benefits from the changes to it. While his W volley of attacks won't deal as much damage (maybe), the AD from Fervor goes to INCREDIBLE use on his Q, his W final hit, and E. His bonus AD ratios are insane, and this change really goes well with that strength. This allows Kled to build tankier since he doesn't need as much AD as before to make his Q and W deal major damage.\nOn the other hand, Kled has Edge of Night now if he wants go full offensive, incredibly boosting his defensive properties with it. Ever tried to engage as Kled only to get hit by a Morgana Q or something similar? Not anymore.\nOf course, this entire prediction runs on the hope that people will try out listed changes and try and see who is successful AND that Kled's success is broadcast to the public.

Plus, even if the Assassin Update is completely balanced, Urgot will still see success as people without a doubt want to try the new Assassins, meaning a near guarantee of 1-2 Assassins per game (maybe even 3).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n{{champion:1}} **Annie Will Have to Be Kept an Eye On**\nWith Assassins across the board having their burst become less instant, Annie shines as a champion that still has incredibly strong and quick burst. When you combine that with her E's % damage reduction to make the stream of Assassins less harmful for her, she is someone who will have to be watched carefully because she might just explode into the meta. While her range is limiting and she relies on sneaking into the enemy team, she still offers some major burst and Tibber's Revenge even offers some incredibly follow up damage that can be incredibly boosted if the target is slowed by Rylai's. Annie seems to be someone who can replace the Assassins' previous role of instantly killing targets that NEED to be instantly killed.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n_Post-Rylai's Changes/Nerfs_\n{{champion:34}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:115}} **Long Range/Control Mages Return**\nWhen Rylai's is nerfed/changed, it's abuse users will likely (hopefully) fall off from the meta a bit. For at least a little bit, people will be looking for some champions who have burst and still provide some equivalent control over a fight. Long range Mages and Control Mages will answer the call. Artillery and Control Mages offer some good zoning and control over team fights that teams will love. Plus, they are some of the best Mages when dealing with Assassins, especially Control Mages.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spoofghoul","date":"2016-11-04T12:32:22.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"first week or two\n\neveryone spams assassins because new and shiny\n\nbeefy's will get played a bit because new shiny masteries\n\nMages can't deal with the midlane assassins because they are building 3 magic resists swords of lalala can't touch this i got too many shields and lifesteal and im fisting your armor\n\nSo mages migrate to toplane cos they still want xp and it's easier to beat on tanks and juggernauts\n\nafter which tanks go midlane to avoid poking by green fathers gift because that and the bonus damage from freshblood on first attack became too overbearing in lane, atleast in midlane people can't easily duck in and out of bushes.\n\nGangplank is now broken because he is abusing greenfather and freshblood.\n\nRyze also broke due to abuse of courage of colossus, as is annie, but then she realizes while she used tld her combo already killed everyone while they where stunned so she reverts back to tld\n\nMages are fighting other mages and ranged carries in toplane now, and tanks are stuck mid vs assassins, assassins are crying their eyeballs out because the tanks keep pushing and won't let them roam and are beating on them screwing over their longer combo's with cc\n\nSo assassins are now going into the jungle and keep raping mages in toplane but somehow cannot seem to kill the botlane carries who somehow have managed to stack up anywhere between 45-60% damage reduction and a lot of lifesteal and are now actually more tanky then tanks are.\n\nTheir supports are also tanks or ranged peel carries and are stacking sustain & shielding to help with knightsvow and to shield their carry who now is an extreme burst dps supertank with a peel & cc slave\n\nAnd assassin's core theme kill that nasty glasscannon no longer exist because mages have figured out stacking frozen hearth with health ap items and ninjatabi & zhonya's + Redsmite runic echo is the way to go and since they already got that smite they might as well stick to jungling.\n\nSo now toplane is a mess because its either extreme mobility skirmnishers and assassins and ranged % reduction stacking carries allover the place all trying to splitpush.\nTanks have nothing to seek up there anymore because everyone as always is completely ignoring their armor with either pen stacking or true damage or % dmg and usually combinations of those, the pesky bugegrs also have too much mobility anyway so you can never fight them on your terms so midlane has become tank vs tank.\nmages try to go there every now and then but they just keep getting ganked when they do by the vanguards diving into their face and the enemy jungle mage blasting them so they also revert back to that\n\nA new meta has now formed \n\nAlso if you don't win by 15 minutes the adc/sup duo becomes a monstoristy bulking with % damage reductions, burst and retarded af dps.

Riot will panic and over buff {{champion:91}} {{champion:55}} when people just needed more time to figure them out, Resulting in them being pick ban for months and eating nerfs every other patch. {{champion:236}} will probably need a buff or 2 because his win rate is kinda crap already and hes losing his top build. {{champion:238}} will become a top laner and be incredibly annoying to deal with while almost entirely leaving the mid lane. In order to kill him, {{champion:85}} will be a good top lane counter, and some strange shit like {{champion:268}} ADC (APC) will be tried to make it so Zed can get almost nothing from his ult change He will be joined by AP {{champion:35}} who will probably need nerfs to AP and buffs to AD. {{champion:84}} is actually going to be just fine, as long as you are playing Tank Akali. AP akali is gone. Tank {{champion:245}} is coming back some time this season as well, probably when the Vanguards get their update and he can abuse a good chunk of their items, but i wont get into that much more because it doesn't relate to the preseason much.  People will probably try to give Tank Ekko its last stand with COTC but wont be able to do it as well. {{champion:7}} will have her clone spawn range nerfed hard, cant say much else but im biased towards her now because i want to add her and Talon to my champion pool. Tank Supports and Junglers will be the meta for their respective roles, Assassin junglers will split play with tank junglers, while mage supports are just thrown out of the meta. As a result of this, {{champion:48}} Support will be a good pick again and {{champion:223}} will be around to deal with the asassins. COTC will break {{champion:89}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:12}}. Players will try to find new champions who can be what the old assassins used to be and who can 1 shot with little to no counterplay. They will go to {{champion:59}}, who will end up being in every game for a while. He'll probably be nerfed so hard that it kills tank Jarvan as well. Other things that will wind up as new mid lane assassins. {{champion:58}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:80}} but wont really work that well. {{champion:157}} will still be a massive pain in the ass and once 10 bans come he wont really exist anymore. {{champion:51}} will be th best ADC, as she not only counters Vayne,but she will be brought mid for a short time because of how she can push in assassins and bully them in lane, and because of how broken her sieging is, and she probably wont take any nerfs for it.\n\nAlmost none of this will probably actually happen though XD","replies":[{"poster":"EcchiOtakuTM","date":"2016-11-04T00:12:30.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Fizz is balanced now though and you can tell when he's at a point of power and beat it....\n\nVayne unless she gets her stealth nerfed by .01 second or duskblade nerfed to 1.01 second of unseen she's going to break it.\n\nRengar, bonetooth wasn't removed, bonetooth ALWAYS ruins rengar ever since release.... But nope let's keep it instead of giving rengar something similar to kha which would still fit his hunter's theme because hunters want to improve their skills for the next hunt. Nope, let's not make another fun mechanic that you can change varying on matches which people said was fun about kha. (I'm pretty salty about this as you can tell, I actually love the rengar kit changes but holy crap is bonetooth going to ruin him and get him nerfed)\n\nTalon and kat are perfect idk why you think a buff would happen, talon's undoubtedly the strongest non-broken assassin <3. Kat would be the strongest assassin but you need time to actually learn her, but she CAN outdo the rest if punish well enough I love facing her now though, she can still kill fast but you can counter it reasonably.\n\nLucian like lee is just overused, so their win rates aren't really correct for every 5% play rate after the first 10% should be a -1% to min and max winrate. So at 10% should be 48-52%, 15% 47-51%, 20% 46-50% etc. But that's just rough estimation.\n\nZed wouldn't become a top laner, he's still the same but actually gained a buff vs AD champs, he IS however nerfed if the enemy lack AD and have an on-hit type adc which will decline when S7 starts cause fervor's change. Overall it's making zed require a bit more skill and giving him a comeback tool if lucky, not to mention no one maxed W early anyways.\n\nAP shaco still has great counterplay(ignoring the shxtty new buff they gave duskblade to actually DISABLE traps, but aside from that ap shaco still has counterplay as long as you're smart and don't act like you can't change your build in a different game). Also AD-wise he'll probably just get a 30-50 damage buff, he really didn't lose too much damage, only real kicker is you HAVE to put 2 points into Q, I feel the rank 1 stealth is far too low to work with. but you get 2 points in Q before level 6 then max E as normal.\n\nAkali, I actually need to try she's the only assassin I havn't tested fully, just wish her passive gave her an AS bonus when in effect cause feels clunky now that you have to weave in AAs a lot more than better.\n\nTank ekko can't comeback they removed some cc, and assassin ekko is just fine cause it's like LB's silence, the damage is still there. (Although I'm still sad ekko's stun wasn't removed, it sure as hell isn't unreliable since even if you don't land it, it's a huge zoning tool. And it sure isn't an ultimate CD like fizz's hard CC. However because they did listen to a prior suggestion of removing 1 of his 3 slows I'll check how this goes). However a bruiser ekko could pop up since courage is pretty cool, but overall I feel mainly going to see assassin.\n\n\nNah LB's clone does not grant assist which is already a huge blow, I can see it's range being the same. If anything her cook time might scale per level down the line to help her late and end game.\n\nThe fact you didn't add naut to the courage list, (CC intensifies.) Also you should have added knight's vow to that section too.\n\nJ4 doesn't really need anything major to fix assassin, just nerf his ulti base and ratio but let it apply grounded that would fully shift him from assassin back to his tank. If it's still being used his Q's damage could be lower however deals more when hitting a flag(this portion wouldn't scale by AD). Tbh this would just be a rework O_o\n\nLee actually could work due to lethality and unlike wukong/pantheon he doesn't have a skill that takes while to complete.\n\nI don't really see cait out performing twitch tbh, but twitch is hard to play cause mispositioning so I'll side with you and cait for now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jbels","date":"2016-11-03T21:15:34.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Katarina and Leblanc seem to have swapped Skill Caps, so I think Kat will be set to replace her as the mid-game snowballing dickwad that Leblanc was","replies":[]},{"poster":"Handin Out Naps","date":"2016-11-04T04:15:41.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Mages will still be strong as fuck and Assassins will still be useless because they cant do anything for their team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mimy","date":"2016-11-03T21:04:08.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:17}} Support! \n\ni already do that... xD I could wish for it to be meta can't I? \n\nAlso.. \n\nI predict Knights Vow Nerfs.
