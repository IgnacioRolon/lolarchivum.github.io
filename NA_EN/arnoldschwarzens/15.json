Also gave me the idea to make this post.\r\n\r\nFor me it&#039;s AD/Offtank {{champion:76}} top pre patch 4.17.\r\nThere was a time when this was a thing and everyone played it toplane. It combined the annoying poke aspect of the ranged toplaners we see today with the lane presence of a Renekton and the splitpushing capabilities of  Tryndamere. Since I didn&#039;t know draft normals were a thing back then I ran into her every single game. People say the Nidalee of today is annoying but that&#039;s nothing compared to what she used to be.\r\n\r\nOther candidates are {{champion:17}}  in season 1 to 3, AP {{champion:11}} in season 3 and {{champion:92}} in season 4, before they nerfed her E and changed her Q damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2016-11-03T23:25:33.889+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:84}} was like completely busted for a patch, wasn't she? \n*Shivers*\n{{champion:114}} Tank Fiora is also up there, along with Runeglaive Ez.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cloud273","date":"2016-11-04T00:31:52.231+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Runic Echoes Udyr.

The whole time, each Q would ideally be doing aoe damage to 4 targets so an AP yi was the ultimate cleaning crew in a sense.\n\nWhen that failed, he could press W in the middle of the fight after he Q's (and hope nobody CC'd him) to stall and wait for at least an assist so that his reset spree could begin. AP yi could literally outheal turrets back then with his retarded ratio on W (if you think it's high now, you should see it back then).
