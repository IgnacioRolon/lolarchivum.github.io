If you get a Penta kill make the game say a voice line or make a new voice line from your champion that all players can hear\r\n2. achieving a goal should give you a exclusive reward like a icon, ward, emote, or something else\r\n3. If your going to change the mastery emote at least make it better than 3 stripes maybe something important from a champion and put it on the mastery emote like for example Aatrox's blade should be on the mastery emote once you've achieved a goal\r\n\r\nThese are some of the things i would like to see in Eternals","replies":[]}
