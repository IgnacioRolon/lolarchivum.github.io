The system that allocates them is automated and modifications are disabled to prevent abuse of the system. \n\nDisconnections negatively affect everyone in the match, regardless of intent. This is why the system treats all disconnections equally and why penalties cannot be removed or modified. \n\nCrashing out of champ select is most often caused by an unstable connection to the servers, so I recommend working through [our guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) that goes over the most common solutions.\n\nLet me know if you continue to see issues after working through that guide.","replies":[{"poster":"Hossmachine","date":"2016-08-03T03:16:50.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for taking the time to reply to my message i know you cant help that much but it does happen a lot where players are in champ selection with normal ping get a bug saying the client has crashed and then lose LP and get a penalty.. I hope that you guys are working on that but again thank you for taking the time to look at my message and seeing that there is a lot going I'm just glad i could bring this to your attention thank you!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Velotix","date":"2016-08-02T17:41:35.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Please look deeper into this and stop giving us this \"connection\" related issues. If multiple people claim they have this problem, including myself, and troubleshooting connection issues hasn't solved anything yet then I think it's safe to say it's not connection issues.\n\nI've tried multiple locations with different connections, hardwired my PC and it still happens. I removed League completely and reinstalled, did the repair tool, but nothing works. It's pretty frustrating that you can't do anything about the loss of LP considering it's not in our control at this point. I didn't think much of it when it happened early on because bugs are bugs and they will always exist so I didn't track when it started happening but I'd say it was near patch 6.12.\n\nDon't know if this helps narrow it down, but I do recall a client patch (not a game patch) coming out sometime before this all started.\n\nThis needs to be looked at a little more closely than just pre-qualifying it as connectivity issues.\n\nI am going to stream my next grind and see if I can get some footage of it actually happening. 90% of the time it crashes/freezes during champ select and when I open the hextech crafting window.","replies":[]}]}]}
