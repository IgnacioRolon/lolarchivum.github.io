I had a few here or there moments with ping nothing like this.. I load into a game 125 ping okay.. weird. i get into the game moving my champion then it shoots all the way up to 1500 even 1900 ping that is insane. Second i was thinking okay maybe its me ill make sure before I point fingers at you. So I tested my speed its fine okay weird just make sure it wasn't a \"bad game\". So i try it again load in 125 at loading screen get into the game 1500 starting off the bat now I am getting mad so all day today this started yesterday my ping rose really really high. Like the highest i seen was maybe 500 ms before this?? So i need serious help I know its not a formal way to ask but since I play your game a lot and want to keep playing so help me fix this issue.
