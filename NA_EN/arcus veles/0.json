I think we can keep the feel of Veigar's current kit without making it feel so incohesive.\n\nI'm gonna churn out a kit idea here off the top of my head instead of taking apart what's on PBE to avoid becoming a tl;dr mess.\n\n**Equilibrium**\nHis passive is mostly fine.  I think some of his mana costs could use some tweaking, but that's not something I want to get in to the nitty gritty of in this thread.\n\n**Baleful Strike**\nLeave it as is.  Change the AP on champion kill to 3 on kill and 2 on assist across the board rather than gaining 1/2/3/4/5 only on kill.  Now there's less pressure to use his kit less effectively in order to \"secure\" kills from allies.\n\n**Dark Matter**\nRight now it's a delayed meteor strike that synergizes best with snagging them with the stun, otherwise it never hits anything but minions.  Keep the delayed meteor as is - but nerf its base damage and ratio by 40% and make it cause a delayed burn and slow in a larger area (~300 range) around the impact site, to make it in to an effective zone control ability and synergize better with Event Horizon.\n\n**Event Horizon**\nHere's what I'd change the most.\n\nInstead of a ring shaped stun, change it to an inwardly swirling black hole-looking pattern on the ground of the same size\nhttp://www.netanimations.net/moving-animated-swirling-space-black-hole.gif\nthat slows enemy targets (30/35/40/45/50%) that try to walk away from its center (walking around or toward doesn't slow), and speeds up Veigar (10/12.5/15/17.5/20%) when he walks toward the center.\n\nWhen initially placed, Event Horizon interrupts channeled abilities.  If an enemy uses any form of blink, dash or Flash away from the center of the Event Horizon they are briefly stunned.  If the mobility move causes them to leave the Event Horizon, they are forcibly repositioned back to the edge of the Event Horizon they left through during the microstun.\n\nNow this is a cage that forces some real decision-making.\n\n**Primordial Burst**\nThis ability has to be a skillshot.  With the added zone control of Event Horizon and Dark Matter I think this gives Veigar a much better chance of hitting this ability though.\n\nTurn this ability in to a projectile that arrives at whatever specific point Veigar designates (1200 range) and lasts for exactly 1.5 seconds (including travel time) before it detonates in a 250 range circle.  When it explodes, it takes the AP of all units caught and adds it to its damage, but the damage is evenly split.  Only hits champions.\n\n\n_______\n\nJust spitballing here.  I feel like Veigar does need counterplay, but the current kit changes make him more unreliable.  The ideas I came up with were with the idea of going with that concept of unreliability and making it in to a zone control kit with a chaos-centric theme.  It'll make him a much more interesting team fighter while leaving all but his Q potentially dodgeable.","replies":[{"poster":"stuartk11","date":"2015-02-16T21:22:06.286+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's so much potential with Veigar's Event Horizon. It can change the landscape of engagements, and (for me anyways) really defines and separates Veigar from the rest of the mages in the mid lane. I also feel that for balance reasons, Veigar's ultimate has to be a skillshot. His W could be on quite a low cooldown now, since Veigar can no longer use his Event Horizon to instantly stun his target to reliably hit it. It's incredibly easy for his opponent's to dodge since it gets telegraphed so well, but could combine well with his E to hit opponent's a lot easier.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Swarm of Koala","date":"2015-02-16T21:16:32.852+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool ideas, I'll break down how I feel about it.\n\nEquilibrium: Agreed, it's fine, and provides a handy way for Riot to tune Veigar without getting excessive.\n\nBaleful Strike: AP on assist could be insanely strong, especially with event horizon being a large AOE slow/trap.

I know I kinda tore up event horizon, but it's a really cool idea.\n\nI agree with a lot of what you said, and thank you for your honesty about the E.\n\nI think of the assist and kill AP as a control on how quickly he gains AP over the course of the game than as a reward for getting a lot of kill participation.  Somewhat similar to Thresh's souls.  I picked those numbers mostly to show what I had envisioned and not as anything set in stone.\n\nI am not too worried about Veigar potentially being a viable support.  Even with such a large area of effect, Event Horizon is his only cc, and it's on a cooldown comparable to Blitz' grab.  Right now, support Veigar isn't particularly strong, and turning his E in to conditional slows and microstuns instead of the large AoE stun + pick tool it is now would be a slight step down in his support ability.\n\nI tried to design E to rely on him having some gold and AP stacks behind his other abilities so there are regional damage threats to go with the regional cc threats of Event Horizon to create a sense of pandemonium.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2015-02-17T06:43:52.802+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Good changes.\n\nWhat if his W had a charge system and he could cast multiple in a fight or teamfight?\n\nPossibly change his passive into mana regen per 5 based on Ability power","replies":[{"poster":"Arcus Veles","date":"2015-02-17T20:15:15.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CynicalGiant,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8AMIuzIm,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-02-17T06:43:52.802+0000)\n> What if his W had a charge system and he could cast multiple in a fight or teamfight?\n\nI think I would prefer his W to have a lower cooldown rather than a charge system, with all of the persisting/delayed ground effects I'm giving him.  Being able to have out potentially two W's, an E and an R all of moderate to large size would be too strong.\n\nRight now W's cooldown is at 10 seconds, which is a decent number for my idea if you were to put... a .6 ratio on impact then .2 ratio burn per second over 3 seconds, let's say.

I hope people can visualize how the kit would play through the descriptions, without me having to get too crazy with the details.\n\nLittle things like people being able to walk around the center of the Event Horizon (like in an orbit) without being slowed but at the cost of having to take a detoured route are hard to intimate without a picture or diagram, but if you try to describe the play and counterplay in detail you end up with people losing interest or becoming confused.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"windwolf777","date":"2015-02-18T04:48:18.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I like it all except the ult.
