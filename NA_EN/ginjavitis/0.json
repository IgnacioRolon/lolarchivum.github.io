When they can build RoA/abyssal and then warmogs and get free 3k hp of health regen in 10 second then they don’t have to worry about getting poked for their mana. Plus they get stats that compliment like health regen in other forms.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2018-03-04T18:46:03.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I run out of mana when i build catalist all the time becuase 1 it reliant on my enemy attacking me and 2 the mana you get per attack is capped at 20 for 100 + damage when im taking 300 damage chunks at least and my hp pool is only 3000 hp or less","replies":[{"poster":"Ginjavitis","date":"2018-03-04T19:56:30.332+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The mana regen on it is still very situational i don;t like that you have to take damage on it to actuallly get soemthing back my point was that you can actually afford to use it 90% more than any mage because if i get hit by something chances are i'm gonna dies anywhere passed 15-20 minutes","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2018-03-05T02:05:41.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont like it either but Fighters and Tanks who have Less  overall damage, range, base defenses, base hp, base mana, mana regen.

Tanks do have mana options, and after one MR item and more HP items they now are very difficult to deal with on most mages. Plus with the introduction of boneplating and adaptive mages just got an item added that is stronger against them than randuins into an ADC, which is huge considering that we already have problems dealing with a lot of people. Fighters are still very strong against most mages that don't have good kiting mechanics because in a fight where you get to us, we can't kill you faster than you can kill us, which is what's supposed to happen when a fighter jumps onto a mage lol. Mages do get nice items to increase a bit of survivability, but it doesn't at all mean we're tanky we don't have the luxury to build MR, Armor, HP and still do amazing damage, it definitely still affects us.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
