Response times are a *bit longer* than normal due to a large volume of tickets submitted recently. We'll have a specialist with you as soon as possible, though.\n____\nLet me know if you have any other questions or concerns. ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"Xanvian","date":"2016-10-26T21:40:12.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got a response last night and I've replied and  submitted all the info the specialist asked of me. But I still have not gotten any password reset email and the specialist I feel hasn't even bothered to check what responses to that ticket and the other tickets I've put in regarding the fact that my account got transferred to a different region and the 200$ that was charged to my credit card =(","replies":[]}]}]}
