First, you'll want to **log into the game** and then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your config folder, which should be in your install directory:\n\n**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config**\n\nDelete these two files:\n**- input.ini\n- PersistedSettings.json**\n\nAfter completing those steps, leave the match and relog. You can then hop into another custom match with bots and make the changes you want. The settings should be default already, but if not you can hit the 'set to default button' and that should be it!","replies":[]}]}
