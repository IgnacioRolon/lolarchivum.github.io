I pulled into a restaurant and he pulled in from the other side and got out of his car. So i reversed and dipped out. I pulled into another apartment complex and chilled for like 5 minutes. When i pulled out he saw me again, he got out of his car and ran after me. I sped off and went to my apartment about 20 minutes later i see him roll up (i&#039;m assuming he just drove around the area until he found my car, the complex is huge it would take at least 10 minutes to navigate the whole thing by car) He asked someone who the car belonged to and they told him me obviously and he began banging on my door. I was the only one home so i sure as hell wasn&#039;t fixing to open it. I&#039;m only 18 and this dude looked like he was at least 35 and he was a pretty big dude.\r\n\r\nI was considering calling the cops if he kept banging on the door, but after a few times he went over and kicked like 3 dents in my car then he drove off.  Sadly i was not thinking to take a picture of his license plate or anything because i was pretty panicked. Pretty much the Police can&#039;t do anything because we don&#039;t really know anything about him.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of this? Was his reaction reasonable? Is that what i get for cutting someone off?","replies":[]}
