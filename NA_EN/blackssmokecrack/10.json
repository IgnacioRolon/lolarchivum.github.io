All the players I&#039;ve talked to about what would make league better, not a single one said an updated HUD.\r\n\r\nNow i&#039;m not gonna say the new HUD is bad, it looks pretty nice and i&#039;ll get used to it. But even if i like it, a decent amount of the community does not. You&#039;re making a good portion of the community unhappy with this update, and the truth is there are SO MANY OTHER THINGS YOU COULD HAVE DONE.\r\n\r\nAlso, before i continue don&#039;t give me the &quot;different departments!!&quot; argument. Do you think whatever department in charge of creating the new HUD did it for free? Do you think that they didn&#039;t require a ton of resources/money? Do you not  think Riot had to outsource or hire new people to make this possible? They could have easily invested the resources put in the HUD to do other things.\r\n\r\nNow what could Riot have done instead of a new HUD?\r\n\r\nHow about a new client? People have been asking for this forever. The current one is buggy and almost the entirety of the community dislikes it and wants a new one that doesn&#039;t break if you leave it idle for 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nHow about fixing the thousands of in game bugs? There are so many threads that list hundreds and hundreds of bugs that have been around forever and Riot just doesn&#039;t want to fix them. Invisible skill shots have been around for 3 fucking seasons now.\r\n\r\nReplay system? Wasn&#039;t this on the PBE like 2 years ago? Whatever happened to that? \r\n\r\nWhat about a sandbox mode? Where we can actually customize our custom games? Everybody wants this and Team Liquids head coach recently said it would make scrims so much better if there was a place to just practice certain mechanics.\r\n\r\nEast coast servers? Half of the region still can&#039;t play the game properly. Certain combos just ARE NOT POSSIBLE with high pings. \r\n\r\nRanked dominion? I never play Dominion but i honestly feel bad for the people who consistently play Dominion and want to play it more competitively. The guy who is in charge of Dominion doesn&#039;t even play it anymore lmao...\r\n\r\nRiot just provide some clarity as to why you decided to ignore the request of your entire player base and pour resources into something nobody asked for? Something that makes a good portion of the community simply unhappy? Something that is going to take time to get used to and at the end isn&#039;t better than what we currently have?","replies":[]}
