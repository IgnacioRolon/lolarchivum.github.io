I can load my games now.\r\nTo prove it, after success load to my game, I opened XunYou again to test if it is the problem, in fact, I cannot load once again.\r\n\r\nSo I think this is the main reason for the league of crash.\r\nSince it is a Chinese software I guess rito didn&#039;t put them into the test list anyway.\r\n\r\nNow if I want to play league I have to go win+R open the cmd, and type &quot;netsh winsock reset&quot; then restart the PC every single time until you fix the problem.\r\n\r\nYA TY RITO.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Afic","date":"2018-06-15T17:13:12.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Likely an issue related to content discussed in [this](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/sB4ucqXc-game-client-anti-cheat-changes-going-live) thread.

It started yesterday morning and there's been a few small patches that changed the error's effect (it's caught by a new error report dialog box, now) but no revert to the working last Wednesday League.
