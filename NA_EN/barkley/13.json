That can't be denied.\n\nBut it's still a regular occurrence to end a game something like 40-4 and there was legitimately never anything my team could do.\n\nOne kill determines a lane.  Maybe even more than that if the person is competent enough to roam and help snowball other lanes.\n\nThe game is entirely decided on whether or not you get paired with people that know how to play safe, or people who wanna do nothing but fight all game long.\n\nIf you get a team that doesn't know when or how to chill, may god have mercy on your soul.\n\nMany people have realized that playing safe and scaling is key.  \n\nBut there are more than enough people out there who just wanna see champion kill champion, and it's just a feed fest snowball from hell - and in those games I have literally zero agency.\n\nAll I can do is watch my teams death count (or kill count, depending) stack up like a goddamn gas pump, and hit surrender every time it's available or wait til the victory screen comes up.  I've got nothing to do with it, most times.  Just along for the ride.\n\n29-6, \"we should contest dragon!\"\n\n32-7, \"their adc briefly showed on the minimap, quick chase him down!\"\n\nSurrender fails.\n\n38-7, \"the enemy support is warding here, let's get him!\"\n\nAnd it just doesn't stop.  It just gets worse, and worse, and worse.  My team tries desperately to fight their way back into the game, and in doing so just gets mauled.  Just obliterated.  That, or were the ones obliterating.  Either way, it's not fun.  It's not satisfying.\n\nBecause there is no coming back right now.  You play safe to stay even, or you play safe to gain small advantages, and you wait til late game when one or two fight decides the whole game - the better scaling team wins.\n\nAnd I'm fine with that, tbh.   Late game fights are fun.  They're skillful.  They give a sense of agency.  I feel like I matter.  What I'm NOT fine with is the 25 minutes of walking on eggshells it takes to get there.\n\nIf you act before that and fail, congratulations you just kicked the snowball down the hill.  Good luck.  You're going to lose, and it's all your fault because you made ONE mistake.\n\nBut it doesn't even have to be you.  It could be any of your 4 team mates, or any combination of the 5 players on your team.\n\nOne bad play, and the game just goes to shit because everyone starts to scramble.  Everyone panics, because it's not exactly hidden knowledge what the state of the game is right now.  Everyone knows.  We all know.\n\nWe all know what comes next.  The 20 minute slaughter fest with no chance of redemption outside of some major screw up.  Some lucky, fortunate mistake.  That's the only hope there is once the ball gets rolling.\n\nThere's no strategic planning to edge back into the game.  There's no trading objectives.  There's no covering your weaknesses, there's none of that.  You're just at the mercy of the enemy and whether or not they play cleanly from that point forward.  Whether or not they know how to close a game.\n\nIf they do? It's over.  Gg.\n\nNow if you just would have left that cannon minion alone, this never would have happened.\n\nThank god Stardew valley is coming out with multiplayer soon.\n\nThank god I get paid next week and I can pick up monster Hunter world.\n\nBecause fuck this game as it stands right now.  Been playing since season 1 and I really, truly think I'm on to greener pastures.  I just can't do it anymore.  I don't even enjoy it.","replies":[{"poster":"TitanAnteus","date":"2018-02-25T15:33:59.578+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":12,"body":"40-4 doesn't just mean one lane stomped.
