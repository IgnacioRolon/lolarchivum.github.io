Luckily not many people know how to pull it off, but I made several attempts to report this myself aswell as other people and it always got ignored.\n\nTherefore, this works till today:\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/6jJPQkmc-gameplay-lee-sin-is-immune-to-taunts-on-demand\n\nHere are also some older reports of this.

This is not even a bug, it is a missing feature. So this is not even the right board for this thread. Also the title is a joke. Why stress Riot in such an improper way when there is clearly a ton of other stuff they should care about first?
