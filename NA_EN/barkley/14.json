Either players intentionally Op.GG you and choose to troll games just because they see you're in a promotion, or they legitimately are much worse players. I don't know if it's a bug with the cusp tier team placements, but Promo games are almost always long, 1 sided games where you either have to have a duo and 2v5, or 1v5 long enough that your team actually begins playing or attempting to win.\n\nIn this account's Gold IV Promos in October, My game 1 had 3 UNRANKED players. My game 2 had a Zed that had 89% win rate with Zed who claimed to be a rank 68 smurf who was boosting someone, and went 26/0/9 in 18 minutes. Game 3 had 2 Unrankeds.\n\nMy new account's first 3 placement games literally had 2-3 int feeders each and each resulted in a 15-18 minute surrender where I was the only person who voted No. 2 of the Int feeders actually ran down mid, rather than even bother hiding it.\n\nI have never had Gold players in a Gold V or Gold IV promo. They are always Silver III-IV and the OTHER team has Golds, and I've been there about 50 times since 2014. That might be shitty RNG, but it sure feels like a matchmaking bug, and most of the community probably agrees. You can win 8 games in a row to set up a promo, and they can be easy, and then suddenly, promos are 3-4 times as hard.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-02-01T21:15:48.262+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Promos will always be hard to win - the point of promos is to prove that you deserve to be in a higher tier/division. You aren't going to get matched with the best teammates against crappy enemies. You'll be matched with people around your skill, and matched against people of the skill you're trying to promote into (at least that's the idea).\n\nFurther, you cannot take the rank of a player to correlate to their MMR. There's plenty of Gold 5 that have a MMR that equates to mid-silver, but haven't played enough games to be demoted from Gold 5. Further, there's plenty of high silver who have MMR higher than that of gold 5s.","replies":[{"poster":"Azadethe","date":"2018-02-01T21:40:39.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is true, and I usually don't have time to individually update 9 people per game to figure out whose below their rank in MMR so Silvers might deserve gold and Golds might need demoted, but that's not my major issue; it's the abundance of \"Unranked\" players who have no actual sample size who get into a Promo game. It's the fact I know there's not much of a difference between a Silver I player and a Gold V player (there is a marginal difference in skill, but it's not something I could pin down and say, \"Silver doesn't know how to patiently farm, while Gold V does.\" Imo, both tiers still suck at it, and still make aggressive plays which result in fast snowballs regularly)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Der Lindwurm","date":"2018-02-01T20:55:40.629+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chermorg,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yjufkWGa,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-02-01T20:54:24.508+0000)\n>\n> This is how it works in ranked.

The programming itself\n\n2. Statistical analysis of many players' data that does not corroborate your claim.\n\n----\nConfirmation bias is real and people fall victim to it all the time with this type of conspiracy. You want some reason that you're losing more games - you think your skill should keep increasing exponentially - so your mind makes up this crap about being purposefully matched with feeders/trolls. Even going so far as people claiming people are trolling when they aren't, just because they don't want to accept that their skill level has leveled off.\n\nI see it all the time - the complaints are the same, and they're just as false.","replies":[{"poster":"Barkley","date":"2018-02-01T21:32:25.623+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"You're running around this post shitting on everyone with some holier-than-thou attitude about statistics and facts and whatnot, when honestly people are just sharing their experiences about how they feel when they play ranked.

No need to stand on a soap box and talk down to everyone.  Especially not in like..... 4 different comments.\n\nThe whole point in me making this post was to add some humor to a situation which can feel like a pretty shitty experience for players.  It was a joke, for the most part.  Ha ha, funny..... but you've just completely bypassed that so you can run around here waving your spreadsheets at people and talking down your nose at everyone.\n\nIt says next to your name you're an advisor, and that's fine.

If the system was fair like you said in your opening remarks then those casual players would not play the game. I am sure most of them get carried more often than not and they need to have a sense of success so they don't get frustrated to the point they quit playing the game and giving the green.\n\nThis 50% win garbage enables shitty players to stay shitty players.

So really, every game depends on a major element of luck. \nHowever, in the words of Seneca, “Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity\".
