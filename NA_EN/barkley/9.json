I&#039;m a Senior in college pursuing a CS degree, and I&#039;m pretty sure I could figure it out, given the code for the game.  You could probably pay some pimply faced high school student 30 bucks to do it.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m getting so tired of seeing this kind of language in chat.  I don&#039;t know if these kids think they&#039;re cool, or they think they&#039;re edgy, or what.  I swear I see this garbage in like.... 15-25% of my games these days.\r\n\r\nNot to mention club names.  Every variation of every hateful word you can think of in these club names, and Riot doesn&#039;t seem to care.  People with club names like %%%%%% and the like.  (an obviously exaggerated example, but you get my point)\r\n\r\nRiot has made very clear their stance on such language, and yet they leave it to the players to report the behavior.... why?\r\nIf your stance on the matter is that it is absolutely not tolerated, why not pre-empt the entire situation with an automated system?\r\n\r\nYou type it in ANY chat.  ANYWHERE.  Even in a message to your friends, BOOM.  Instant chat restriction.  \r\n\r\nMake it ramp up like any other punishment.  5 games, 10 games, 15 games, 7 day ban, 14 day ban, perma-ban.  Or however it goes.\r\n\r\nI 100% support Riot&#039;s zero tolerance policy on hate speech.  I just think they could be doing more to combat it.","replies":[{"poster":"usul1202","date":"2017-12-27T15:30:39.953+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I enjoy very very obnoxiously bad puns. My roommate has lived with it for 4 years now, and we play together. While we're normally in voice, it has happened that he's been unable to talk, and will simply type massive insults at me after a pun. When we have 5 people who are in on the joke this will include things such as telling me to kill myself and other banned slurs. We don't report it, because we're all in on it. \n\nI think requiring a report makes the system much more community responsive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2017-12-27T09:35:59.698+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because if the 4 (or 9 if all chat) players during that games do not find what you say offensive, then you can throw every single racist, homophobic slur, death threats, etc. comments in chat and I guaranteed you will not see any punishment or even so much as a warning.\n\nIt is a fact that if you do not get reported, your game will not be reviewed.  You cannot be punished.  If those 4 (or 9) players do not report you, they are telling the system they don't mind what you said.  The system will response with \"okay, moving on\".\n\nFor this reason, you will never see an auto-restricted system implement in your lifetime because until SOMEONE tell Rito he/she is not okay with what you said, Rito will not auto-punished you.\n\nThis is one of the ways the IFS learn what is or is not acceptable based on what people will or will not report a player.","replies":[{"poster":"Barkley","date":"2017-12-27T10:05:24.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Riot has come out and said they have a zero tolerance policy for hate speech.\n\nAs per Merriam-Webster:\n> _Hate speech is speech which attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such as race, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, or gender._\n\nSo I don't think it should matter what anyone is or isn't offended by, or what they do or don't report anyone for.  Zero tolerance means zero tolerance, and on the subject of hate speech, I think anything less is a disservice.\n\nForgive me, but I just fail to see the \"Pro-hate speech,\" or \"Sometimes Hate Speech Is Ok\" or \"Its fine as long as nobody gets offended\" side of the argument.\n\nI doubt anyone at a KKK meeting gets offended by the N-word, that doesn't make it any less wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-12-27T10:34:13.481+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What he is saying is that if you and the rest of your 5 man premade are ok with it then you can say it.

Just because I call my friend some slur in private does not mean I hate gay people, or I have any resentment towards them. I am NOT a hateful bigot for doing so, and pretending like I am is watering down the term which harms those hurt by actual bigots. \n\n> But in any other context it should be instantly and automatically punished.\n\nIt is, if reported. Even if you tell it to friends and they report you, you'll get instantly punished with a 14-day ban or permaban, depending on previous punishments. But if literally no one is harmed or offended in ANY way why should the player in question be punished? \n\n> If I had my way about it, it would just be an instant permaban, but I'm trying to be reasonable for the sake of approachability.\n\nWhich is why you don't have your way. Because it's not rational, and it's oversensitive (which is a term I VERY rarely use about someone).\n\n> There are thousands of words in the English language. There is no excuse to choose words that are purposely hateful unless you are purposely being hateful.\n\nThere absolutely is. I can use hateful words in jokes towards my friends in private and it wouldn't make me a hateful person because no one is offended or harmed in anyway. You can't call me hateful, because I quite literally don't carry hate towards anyone.","replies":[{"poster":"Barkley","date":"2017-12-27T15:53:01.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Wow 4 upvote to a kid who's saying it's ok to use racial slurs and hate speech as long as nobody's offended. \n\nAnd downvotes to me for saying hate speech isn't ok in any context.\n\nHow embarassing. \n\nHow utterly depressing.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2017-12-27T16:09:32.452+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It can't be quite as embarrassing as turning the conversation from one about hate speech and social groups into one about downvotes and upvotes.\n\nLike, to me, you lost a lot of credibility by focusing on the upvotes and downvotes.

Some people just have exceedingly crass humor, but as long as they're doing it in a closed social circle like that, without exposing anyone else to it, it isn't really doing any of the damage it otherwise would.\n\nHe isn't saying it's acceptable, not in the slightest from what I'm reading, but he's saying that the system (as it is now) roughly works for everyone.

Similarly, if folks queue as a team of five, they should be able to say what they want. \n\nUltimately, it would be great to live in a society where words don't hold this sort of negative power. League certainly isn't the place for that battle to be fought, to be clear. But I think it's foolish to take the power away from the community to determine what is or is not appropriate and just let Riot be the judge. The current IFS system is built upon what the community has stated is inappropriate for the game's communication, and it makes sense to me that we continue to let the people decide.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2017-12-27T16:28:16.897+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, please calm down.

However, you _do_ need credibility to pitch ideas like changes to the IFS or something of the like. Shifting focus away from the discussion and towards upvotes and downvotes, as well as flipping your lid, harm your credibility and make it less likely that folks would consider your proposals.\n\nNobody is saying that hate speech is okay, either. There are just some people out there who play in full groups so that they don't run the risk of affecting other people with their awful humor. They very likely know it's not okay, and they very likely compose themselves differently with random players than they do with their premades.\n\nDoes this make it okay? No. Do we advocate this? No. Does it happen and slide under the radar? Probably, yes. As long as they're mindful of us, we are mindful of them. This does not give them a pass to use hate speech whenever - just that they have yet to be reported for it for one reason or another.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2017-12-27T11:45:00.646+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the biggest problem with not requiring a report as a trigger is that it takes away the community's feedback.
