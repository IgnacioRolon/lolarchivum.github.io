Boneplate is super good on him too with conditioning.\r\n\r\nIf I get way ahead, I just rush rylai&#039;s and liandry&#039;s.\r\n\r\nIf I&#039;m needing to tank vs AD, I build frozen heart and liandry&#039;s.\r\n\r\nIf I&#039;m needing to tank vs AP, I build abyssal and liandry&#039;s.\r\n\r\nI have options!
