Are you searching through tens of thousands of lines of code for the one spot where there&#x27;s a mistake, or is it more organized and manageable?\n\nHmm, less \"or\", more \"and\". A lot of tech/code debugging is searching through tens of millions of lines of code for the N number of spots where there's mistakes in an, ideally, organized and manageable way.\n\n\nDebugging techniques are generally specific to whatever programming languages, tech base, and so on that you use. There's a few that's commonly shared among many development environments though, like stepping through running code or data inspection.\n\nBut rather than try to explain... I can show you! (Assuming you're using **Chrome** and not on a mobile.  These steps will be different for different browsers):\n\n\n\nIN THIS PAGE, the one that you're reading, hit F12. This opens the debugging tools in Chrome.\n\nNow click the 'Console' tab at the top of the large thing that popped up. Find the input area, and type in:\nRiot\nThen press enter.\n\nThere is now an entire data object you can explore around, and even change things if you wish (its all local and any changes you do can be undone by refreshing the page).\n\nEach part of this object can be opened and looked at individually. Or you can type out the address to that, from Riot. Type in:\nRiot.DDragon.models.champion.data.Ahri\nThen press enter.\n\nYou'll see some data specific to Ahri.\n\nThis is data inspection. This type of tool lets you look at what state / memory is in, and figure out any inconsistencies near where your problem might be.\n\n\nNow lets swap to the 'Sources' tab. In here, you can explore the data structures and code that makes up the webpage we're on.\nPress F8. You're now stepping through code as it runs.\nPress F10. Each time you press F10, you step to the next operation. You can see exactly which piece of code is running with each step, as well as how data changes as you step through it in the various boxes you see below.\n\nThe code you see here is different from what we see (the webpage code has been compressed to the point of being practically unreadable), but this is the basic idea of what ONE KIND of debugging entails.\n\nDebugging League of Legends itself is not that different from this, even though the language is quite different (the LoL game is primarily C++). Again though, this is just the most basic of debugging. Each different type of problem requires a different type of tool to explore it and fix it. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Wolfeur","date":"2017-11-30T08:50:37.074+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Hmm, less \"or\", more \"and\".\n\nWell, if you're going to mistake boolean operators, we sure can expect a few bugs\n\n{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Better Jungler","date":"2017-11-30T08:08:36.970+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Im voting this to be the second best red post I've ever seen. *(grouping all of Riot Tantrum {{summoner:11}}  gets first place)*","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2017-11-30T00:12:22.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It may be different for them based on where the bug appeared.

If there's no defaults to pick from you'd be without any runes at all, and I'd rather get Press the Attack Shen than No Runes Shen. That actually happened in a game for me, the page didn't want to save so I ended up with the Press the Attack default page. Luckily it was just a co-op game to finish a mission real quick, so I built AD Shen instead.","replies":[{"poster":"Faceroll Tactics","date":"2017-11-29T13:41:09.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then just revert the page to the last working version.","replies":[{"poster":"Leetri","date":"2017-11-29T18:00:20.455+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're working on a new page there is no previous version to pick from, so it's either no runes or one of the defaults.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Totally Not Jinx","date":"2017-11-29T17:37:23.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fun fact, this is what they do.
