The entire series - except maybe games 1 and 2, were fairly back and forth.  Games 3 and 5 don't show that as much with the gold leads, as the side that won had the gold lead through the majority of each of those games, but they were still fighting tooth and nail.  Game 4 was actually the only one where the gold lead changed several times, so it is a little more obvious that there was a lot of ups and downs for both teams.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-10-20T21:02:37.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was really just an entire series showing the power of pick/bans.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-10-22T19:05:00.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Watch RNG vs Fnatic games 2 and 3.\n\nThey are gut-wrenching.
