It doesn't matter that you're posting it on the boards. What decides new skins is the champion's popularity. \nIllaoi isn't played enough, and her current skins don't sell well enough, so it's a waste of manpower to make new skins for her when they could make a skin for a champion they know will make money. \n\nI think a big part of why even the voting event didn't end up making them a lot of money off her Resistance skin is because they decided to remove the aspect of it people actually voted for-- the hands on the tentacles and their metal color.","replies":[{"poster":"Jaspers","date":"2019-04-16T22:43:44.266+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Ecdysiast,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=vEl2L4AA,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-04-16T22:37:24.308+0000)\n>\n> and her current skins don't sell well enough\n\nCan't sell skins if you never make skins for the champ.","replies":[{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2019-04-16T22:47:13.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jaspers,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=vEl2L4AA,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-04-16T22:43:44.266+0000)\n>\n> Can't sell skins if you never make skins for the champ.\n\nWhich is why I gave you the example of the skin they did make. She has two skins. You can't pretend she doesn't. And how those skins sell is what determines whether or not they make more.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
