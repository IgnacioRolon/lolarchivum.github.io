Hmm... that must be terrible.  It must be terrible that high elo players are finally starting to deal with what low elo players have been fighting for a LITERAL DECADE.\r\n\r\nI feel so bad for you.  What a horrible thing, that your poor, poor dia+ asses are JUST NOW finally starting to deal with the impossible-to-enjoy stress fest that is \"Trying to climb even though literally everyone is trying to throw your game or disconnect or feed or int, or if you get a decent game where nobody's doing that, you have to read paragraphs and paragraphs of flame text the whole time\"\r\n\r\nIts such a shame that you're dealing with disconnecting players, or players running it down mid when they get mad, or players purposely running troll strats to hard-tank the game.\r\n\r\nBecause for years, we low-elo players have been saying this is a problem, and we just get met with \"FUCK YOU LOW ELO TRASH UR GARBAGE NOBODY CARES ABOUT YOUR STUPID OPINIONS, GIT GUD\"\r\n\r\nMaybe now that its happening to the aristocrats, Riot will pay attention to it and maybe fix it -- but I doubt it.\r\n\r\nMaybe 5 years ago when Riot cared, if this would have happened, it might have been fixed.  But the current iteration of Riot couldn't give any less of a shit about its player base -- so it'll probably just stay that way.\r\n\r\nGOOD.\r\n\r\nI'M GLAD\r\n\r\nI'll sit back and watch as all the high elo princesses run around with their hair on fire about this, the same way they've sat back for A LITERAL DECADE and down-played the issue for low-elo players because it wasn't affecting high elo.\r\n\r\nWelcome to hell, bitches.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-08-05T12:25:10.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hahahaha I enjoyed that","replies":[]}]}
