And wow.  She's quite oppressive in lane.  Almost as bad as malzahar.\r\n\r\nNearly infinite mana on nearly instant wave clear.  I have routinely been 40-50 CS up on my opponent, and once I get an item or 2, I can pretty much kill them for free with flash + W + R + Ignite or Q + W + R + Ignite.\r\n\r\nCombine that with almost complete immunity from ganks via her spell shield, and she's pretty strong ATM.  And honestly I think it all stems from the fact that her mana costs are basically non existent.\r\n\r\nBut hey...  that's just one gold player's opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"DariusDemiurge","date":"2017-12-18T04:32:13.398+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2017-12-18T05:22:58.436+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2017-12-18T04:18:02.870+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"110 mana at max rank on her W.\n\nGet gud/play against better opponents","replies":[]}]}
