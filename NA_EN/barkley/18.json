He&#039;s always been an above-average support, but when you look at Nautilus you just don&#039;t think &quot;Man, this guy should be a support.&quot;\n\nHe&#039;s a giant lumbering possessed dive suit with a massive anchor.  To me, that says &quot;I&#039;m a tank, and I wanna beat stuff up.&quot;\nnot &quot;I&#039;m a hook and slow CC bot that babysits ADCs&quot;\n\nWe&#039;ve gotta give this guy some kind of identity.  His lore seems to state that he&#039;s stalking his prey, so in my head that means he should be a jungler.  His kit is basically ready to go for jungling anyway.\n\nAnd yeah, Nautilus CAN jungle right now... but not very effectively.  He&#039;s outclassed by virtually any other tank jungler.  Between his mana costs, cooldowns, and low early damage, he just can&#039;t keep up.  He does fine once he gets cinder hulk, but so does everyone else.  It just doesn&#039;t feel good to play Nautilus jungle.\n\nI don&#039;t care if we make him a top laner, a mid laner, a jungler, whatever.  Doesn&#039;t matter to me.  I just don&#039;t see the guy being a support, appearance wise/lore wise.  It doesn&#039;t make sense.  And that is his best role right now, statistically.\n\nIf we want him to be a mid laner, we should up his AP scalings.  To be honest, this game needs more tank mid laners.  Right now what have you got.... cho&#039;gath, malphite, and galio?  Are there others?  None that I can think of off the top of my head.\n\nIf we want him to be a jungler, maybe his E could do additional damage to monsters and refund part of the cost if it damages monsters.  Maybe his W cooldown could be lowered by 1s every time a monster attacks him like Amumu.\n\nIf we want him to be a top laner, he needs some way to sustain himself.  Maybe add a passive to his W that says &quot;Every minion nautilus kills while W is active sends them to the deep.  upon sending &#039;x&#039; minions to the deep, Nautilus restores &#039;y&#039; % of his maximum health and mana.&quot; or something.  I don&#039;t know, I&#039;m not a game designer.  I&#039;m just spitballing ideas.\n\nand.....-cringe- .... if we truly do want to relegate him to being a support, which I DO NOT approve of, I feel like he needs something to help him synergize with his lane partner.  Maybe his CC&#039;s can mark their target like leona&#039;s do for some bonus damage or something.\n\nNautilus just feels &#039;meh&#039; wherever he goes right now.  Doesn&#039;t really have an identity.\n\nI&#039;d like to see him get some help in that regard.","replies":[]}
