You assume these people are reformed, they are not. And it's not riots goal to reform people with a perma ban, the goal is to get rid of them. \n\nIn most cases this works but we are talking about 30 million active accounts which means there will always be jerks which want \"revenge\" and fk with some people","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ab0ut30Ninjas","date":"2018-01-06T11:16:03.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"if they wanted to really get rid of them. why not IP block them? i mean its possible and its been done by other regions. just my 2 cents :)","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2018-01-06T11:26:15.799+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"IP bans do almost nothing to the target player in most cases and can have severe consequences in others.\n\nIf I were IP banned and wanted to get around it, I would just have to unplug my modem and plug it back in.

If I recall correctly, what generally gets said about punished players reforming goes something like this:\n\n- The majority of players who get punished once reform and never get punished again.\n- The majority of those who get punished twice reform and never get punished a third time.\n- The (now small) majority of those who get punished three times reform and never get punished a fourth time.\n\nAnd the number continues to shrink further on.\n\nI don't ever recall anyone saying anything about \"the majority of players who are punished with a permaban are reformed\" - so, if you have a link to a boards post where a Rioter said that, I would be very, very interested.","replies":[]}]}
