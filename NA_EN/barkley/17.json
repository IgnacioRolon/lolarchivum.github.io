Its not a hard one to explain.\n\nI CONSTANTLY see club tags with homophobic, racist, culturally insensitive, and hateful connotations. Probably in about 3-4 out of every 10 games, someone&#039;s got an offensive club tag. Pick a condemnable word, and I&#039;ve seen it used as a club tag in one way or another.\n\nIf riot claims they have a zero tolerance stance on these types of behavior in chat, and in summoner names - why is it allowed in club tags? Futhermore, why do I have no option to report it in-game? I have to resort to using a third party screenshot app and navigate through an entire (poorly designed) support website to get things taken care of, and even then I get copy/paste generic responses and no guarantee anyone did anything about it.\n\nAlso, riot needs to step up their game as far as summoner name and club tag filtering. Its not hard to prevent things like N!gger and fa g0t. I&#039;m a 400-level computer science student and I know how to do it, so I&#039;d hope that professional game designers would have the same or better knowledge.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2018-02-03T23:06:28.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, so.\n\nWe're going to be locking this post.

You cannot hold that kind of stance with certain things and not others, and still have it be effective.

Filters get circumvented, so regardless of whatever they do theyll end up having the same people fall through the cracks because theyve proven determined to fall through the cracks, and you also run the major risk of limiting users who want to use the already dwindling club name and tag system to make a clan tag that isnt offensive.\n\nThe only person attempting to stand on a pedestal here is you.

Are you going to create a database with every possible word that is offensive, and then also every single possible substitute people may use for the individual letters? Go through the probably billions of different combinations, if not more, of characters possible in a club tag and filter out each possible combination individually? No. Too much time, not feasible.\n\nAre you going to create a database of prohibited words and add in possible substitutions for letters? People will get around this, even in your example.\n\nNot to mention what are you going to do when the prohibited word is part of a larger word? What if the string of characters that makes the prohibited word shows up across multiple different words, but is not used in a way that is offensive? What about if people shorten the word to abbreviate it but leave it in such a way that you could deduce its intent? Or people that split 2 words in half and swap parts around to get around the filter.\n\nSeriously; no matter WHAT you do, your filter will either be ineffective at stopping people who really want to get around it, or be as ineffective and remove the ability for people to make non offensive names and trip on stupid things (hell is a part of hello, so if you trip solely on string of characters hello is blocked if hell is, but if you dont trip based on string you can just add another letter to the offensive word and get by it)\n\n\nSeriously, between your ignorance and constant uses of logical fallacy to try and paint people as somehow supporting racism for telling you your complaints are wholly unwarranted, i cant tell which ruins your argument more.","replies":[{"poster":"Barkley","date":"2018-02-02T22:40:44.727+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"The point is not to catch everything.

No.  Never claimed to be.  But I'm also not a complete and total noob at it, and I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that there ARE possibilities for the system to be better than it is right now.
