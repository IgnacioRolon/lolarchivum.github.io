The system is not working if the latter is whats banworthy and the former is just scoffed at. Especially when said person add&#039;s you later to say &quot;hahahaha enjoy your ban fucknugget&quot;, &quot;n****rs like you ruin this great game&quot; &quot;I have 36 accounts and ill never get banned from this game&quot; \r\n\r\nAdd IP banning to the list and this shit would stop instantly, and if someone circumvents that ban the MAC address. They don&#039;t deserve to play the game if they continue to show the same behavior over and over again. Toxicity begets toxicity, or for you non-Shakespearean readers, It takes a toxic player to make another player toxic it&#039;s not a one way street. People question why this community is so toxic well, a human being can only take so much abuse before they just stop caring about consequences of their actions. \r\n\r\nLong story short, Automated systems are bound to being abused, let the community decide  whats toxic and what isn&#039;t again. You&#039;ll see less toxicity in game like back in S2-S3","replies":[{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2017-03-09T16:23:07.278+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who has used the tribunal it wasn't as great as people make it out to be. Hence why Riot took it down. Like others have said people abused the punished mainly because getting the correct action (punish or pardon) got you a small amount of IP, so people basically hit punished just to get the IP. When they stop giving out IP people stop using it.\n\nIt was a great way to get the community involved, but they are revamping it. They are suppose to start working on it once the new client is out which is still in beta. With that said though what you are asking for needs to take time. Even if something like this could be implemented a bunch of rioters and the community need to be on it basically 24/7! And don't expect punishment that is basically seconds out of your games especially for first offenders!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-03-09T13:24:01.895+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The tribunal was very slow and had many false positives. Almost everybody that used it just hit punish without reading anything as soon as it let them.\n\nIP bans are very, very easy to circumvent and can lead to collateral damage at places like college campuses, where everybody has the same visible IP.","replies":[{"poster":"SoulSteaIerVayne","date":"2017-03-09T15:23:37.619+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"But it worked, the levels of toxicity now did not exist back then. You were more scared of getting banned than you are now. You were unlucky if you got a feeder or a troll, now its just about every game you get one and you just pray to RNG that its not on your team. \n\nThats also why I suggested MAC bans, you can't easily change your MAC address, and while Yes as the other poster said it would screw over internet cafe's they keep logs, Last person on said cafe gets a permaban from the cafe as well as having to replace the NIC that he got banned from League servers. Simple fix?","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-03-10T06:29:00.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have ess toxic peopke in my games nowadays than when the tribunal was open by far. They are pretty rarefor me unless I am playing with a low level friend and that is because of the banned people that make a new account.\n\nI can agree with trying mac bans, but I am not well researched in them. I know what it is, just not so much the pros and cons.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Naked Baby Thief","date":"2017-03-09T16:43:57.585+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tribunal was just as bad.  It led to 8 year olds being the deciding verdict the majority of the time.  Most adults don't take the free time out of their day to address the issues.\n\nThis is aside from my typical rant which I inform people that punishment only has exacerbated the issues in the league community, as it does with all communities, both digital and real world.\n\nPeople learn through positive reinforcement.\nNot from punishment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-03-09T15:38:11.367+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"IFS is essentially the same as the tribunal. The system learns from the community reports of what is acceptable and what isn't.\n\nPeople think they can game the system cos they don't see the system at work, others think the system isn't working thus others are getting away with gaming the system. \n\nIn truth, both of those parties don't see the system working when it does work. Thus having misconceptions about the system. \n\nWhat you need is not bringing the tribunal back, but increasing the visibility with something like [this](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/aFmEtAVK-riot-should-add-monthly-status-cards).","replies":[{"poster":"SoulSteaIerVayne","date":"2017-03-09T15:40:28.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could actually get behind this, since it would fix both problems","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2017-03-09T13:55:46.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tribunal was for edge cases only.\n\nYou may have mixed up what is ban worthy. Kys and the n word are bannable first game. Being a turd is not.

These kids usually spout how they don't care if they get banned and idolize Tyler 1 in the respect that they have another account lined up why should they care if one accounts banned they just hop onto the next and continue the same behavior. \n\nWheres the punishment for such repeat behavior?","replies":[]}]}]}
