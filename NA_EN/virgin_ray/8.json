But with the addition of Fairy-Types, it brought both Dragon-Types AS WELL AS ITSELF DOWN, with the exception. Fairy-Types are rarely run, to my knowledge at least, (exception: Gardevoir is so good, just get a Safeguard support in a Double-Battle and she's going to wreck face) and Dragon-Types are now rarely run in FEAR of the possible Fairy-Type/M Gardevoir counter-team.\n\n(Also, side opinion, Sylveon is the worst Eeveelution, IMO. Concept was fine to introduce the new type, but the design is really bad in comparison to something like Umbreon, Flareon, Espeon, and pretty much every other Eeveelution. THOSE Eeveelutions are fairly simplistic and straight-forward in their design while still being extremely charming because they all evolve from the same cute-and-cuddly Eevee. Glaceon and Leafeon were less simplistic, but still perfectly fine and not overkill. Line up all the Eeveelutions, INCLUDING an Eevee, and compare them. Sylveon sticks out like a sore, infected thumb among them.)","replies":[{"poster":"Solari Fortune","date":"2015-10-11T04:25:09.331+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have never played X/Y, mainly cause I didn't have 3DS.
