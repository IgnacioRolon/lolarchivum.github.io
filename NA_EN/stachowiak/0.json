I want to know how I can stop this. I've have tried as hard as I can by not raging in games, trying to cooperate with team mates and just in overall playing my best. Still though, people rage/flame, blame, and throw games. A few games I would just mute anyone who would start insults to teammates just so I wouldn't get involved. Please don't just say \"get better\". I really am working at my hardest. Thanks :) {{champion:99}}","replies":[{"poster":"Nucleophilic atk","date":"2015-02-22T23:26:18.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate when people say, \"You're on tilt\". No. I am playing pretty much the same in my matches. I cannot control if I get 5 feeding teams in a row. The same can be said when I go on a 5 game winning streak. I didn't magically play better, I just had less trolls than the other team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-02-22T23:23:34.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to have this problem especially at the start of the season falling from decent elo (s1-g6) to bronze in placements, and the toxicity was actually getting to me. Now I am starting to climb and I credit alot of this to the simple fact of the minute i see any complaing/whining/flaming i type \"/mute all\" and use pings to communicate. Honestly LoL is not a game about being friends with your teammates, it is about knowing the win condition and executing it, imagine that your entire team speaks different languages, none of you would understand eachother typing, you would rely 100% on pings. There is no such thing as ping spam (okay you can spam on someone to be a douche) as long as it is trying to communicate something, personally 3 pings to suggest something 5 pings to demand it. \n\n\nAlso remember this game isn't your job, if you play poorly or get demoted nobody thinks less of you. Nobody will post on reddit dissecting your CS scores. Another point all ranks/divisions don't mean anything, up until challenger nobody gives a crap if you're bronze or plat, comparing silver to plat is like comparing 2 piles of shit, well this one has corn....it is still an actual pile of crap. (Did not come up with this on my own heard it from the current coach for Gravity LastShadow). Honestly these points should change your attitude, if they don't stop being so emotionally invested into a video game","replies":[]},{"poster":"ClutchCrux","date":"2015-02-22T18:18:57.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Realize that it isn't the end if you lose / get demoted and the people you're playing with for that match you probably wont see again so try to get along with them even if you hate them. Suck up to others on your team doing well and after a loss maybe take a 20 minute break and do something that relaxes you or makes you laugh. If someone is trolling on your team just keep in mind that if you play enough games and do your best you will eventually end up where you should be. Also note that yes everyone wants to be diamond or challenger but aim for smaller things. Always better to feel good that you achieved something rather than grinding out a big achievement.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sirin Gioro","date":"2015-02-22T17:46:25.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Find someone to duo with\nOr you can try to play support/ADC (learn) - I used to main mid but I always have feeding bot lane.
