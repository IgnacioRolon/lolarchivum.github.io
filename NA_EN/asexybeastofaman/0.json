For instance, you were playing Diana in top let's say. Someone else might have had the same score, but a better vision score.","replies":[{"poster":"2ManyJons","date":"2017-08-05T14:04:58.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't understand some of the scoring points. Vision being one of them.\n\nIf all champions use wards, why does vision score factor into an individual champion proficiency rank? Does Jinx ward differently than Lucien?\n\nSome of the score points feel more like a basis for determining a players overall skill, and less of that players skill with an individual champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-06T20:15:39.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see where you're coming from, and it can be looked at as an overall player score as well as champion skill! I believe the reason vision score is calculated into the overall score as well is that it helps to determine just how much you're helping your team overall. Even though it's a mechanic available to every champion in every match (and everyone should probably be contributing to vision somehow), it still helps to figure out just how well you're doing overall. \n\nWith that being said, if you're playing Sona in support then your vision score *probably* holds a much heavier weight than if you were, say, playing Annie in mid. Still, you're always welcome to post your thoughts on this over in [**Gameplay**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance) if you want to get the communities opinions and have a little more visibility towards the devs!","replies":[{"poster":"2ManyJons","date":"2017-08-07T13:59:23.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks :D","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AsexyBEASTofAman","date":"2017-08-05T01:37:53.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you.
