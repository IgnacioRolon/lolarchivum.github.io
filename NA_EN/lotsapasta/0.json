I jsut opened league to play with my friend, when I see that my account was \"Banned for the use of third party software\". which I thought was strange since I, A. never used anything like that and, B. logged on 3 hours ago and was imediatly taken into the practice tool. Naturally I was weireded out and procedded to look at my match histroy when, low and behold, 3 ranked games I never played, hell, I dont even play ranked. So someone must have taken my account, and gotten it banned. It there anyway I can fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-12-13T04:46:40.144+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeap, send in a ticket to https://support.riotgames.com and select account recovery.
