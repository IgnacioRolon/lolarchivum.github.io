People are making accounts just so they can have an easy time farming off new players? Doesn't seem like the  best reason to make a smurf. I understand making new accounts if you're moving to a new region or something but there's hardly any legitimate reason to make a smurf without making you sound like an ass. If you want to learn a new champ then try bot games or suck it up because don't expect to automatically win with champs that you have not completely mastered. Losing is just apart of competition.\n\nI don't expect people to be very ethical on the internet, though.","replies":[]}]}
