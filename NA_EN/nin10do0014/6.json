By using it as a follow-up, the Bard player will likely waste his team's resources for pumping out damage or locking down the enemy team.  \r\n\r\nInstead of constantly ulting the entire enemy team, try to ult 2-3 enemy team members, preferably the enemy back line.  What this does is completely cut their damage in half while still allowing your team to fight 5v2 or 5v3. For anyone who has played Starcraft Brood War, the Protoss race has the Arbiter, which has an ability that works just like Bard's ultimate; it was a AoE stasis effect.  Protoss players would use Stasis to freeze the enemy back line, cutting the enemy's damage in half while allowing the player to kill the remaining half with ease.  This same exact concept applies in this situation.  Cut the enemy team's damage potential in half while keeping the remaining members vulnerable.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the ultimate can also be used as an initiation.  The 2.5 second stasis gives ample time for your team to get into position and to follow-up once the enemy team exits stasis.  As the enemy team waits to get out of stasis, your team is ready to knock them up, stun them, and just outright kill them.  However, this does rely on your team having at least a decent timing for when to use their abilities.\r\n\r\nLastly, I would also use this ult to catch someone who is trying to escape.  Did that pesky Katarina/Lee Sin/Kalista/LeBlanc/Teemo get away?  Ult them from 3400 range away and let your teammates catch up to them.","replies":[{"poster":"Kitten of Evil","date":"2015-03-21T19:05:41.960+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are tons of uses, not just these two... though OP's suggestions are some of the best.

What I am saying is if you want to ult the entire enemy team as Bard, you must either be the very first to ult or the very last to ult on your team.  Ulting in between your teammate's high-impact abilities, like Orianna's, Wukong's, Yasuo's, Malphite's, or Sejuani's ults will mess up the flow of damage as the enemy team may still be locked down, but they will take no further damage while in stasis.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Moonshade","date":"2015-03-22T15:40:44.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"usually it would be better to ult the front line since they tend to be bulkier and take longer to kill off (Mundo, defensive J4, Xin, etc...). The issue I can see being that the back line may use that opportunity to escape. Another good use for Bard ult is to counter engages like if the enemy team has an initiator + Orianna combo, if u time it right u can use the ult to counter both the initiators engage and Orianna ult. U can also use it to set up peel for your carries too since if u ult their assassin and ur adc u have time to get into position to CC the Assassin off of the ADC. Also can hit entire enemy teams or the enemy + objectives to give u a chance to defend. Like if they are on a 5 man mid assault and your team is out of position to defend, ult the tower to prevent them from taking it and the towers behind it (since towers are invulnerable while the ones ahead of them are alive) giving u time to get to the tower to defend it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Astropanda","date":"2015-03-22T06:59:47.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can use it to negate Zed ultimate too.
