However, in the early game, 100 gold is the difference between going back to play with an important item or going back with insufficient supplies to sustain your play.  Changing the price of items like this benefits or hinders laners quite significantly, but laners have the ability to alleviate this problem by practicing their mechanics well in order to maximize their income.  When this change is applied to the Jungle, however, we are talking about a different scenario.\r\n\r\nJunglers, unlike Laners, do not have the luxury of having a stable income of minions.  We are like freelancing workers who pick up money wherever we can, so that means we never have a reliable source of gold; we can get a surge of money from ganks, dueling, or power-farming, or we can get demolished from failed ganks, jungle invades, and the brutality of 4 chickens.  Thus, being said, increasing an early-game Jungle Item has much more drastic consequences for Junglers, meaning a 100 gold increase on our items hurts us more than laners.  What makes this even worse is that because of the drastic changes to the Jungle in Season 5, many Junglers need to recall after taking our third camp, meaning those Junglers will recall with 350 gold in their pockets.  There are not many Junglers who, with standard Jungle Runes and Masteries, can naturally stay in the Jungle long enough to get an extra 100 gold for the first Tier-2 Jungle Item, and there are other Junglers who need to take unorthodox or gimmicky Runes and Masteries consisting of Spell Vamp runes and masteries.\r\n\r\nAnd why is this bad?  Because we already have a small group of Junglers who have not been been suffering as much, Jungle diversity has been decreasing because that small elite group of Junglers are outclassing everyone else.  Why play x Jungler if Fiddlesticks can outsustain everyone or if Jarvan can do it without getting beaten up by the Jungle creeps?  With the 100 gold increase to the Tier-2 Jungle Item, the small group of Junglers who can stay in the Jungle may not be affected, but anyone who has been suffering in the Jungle will be playing catch-up from the beginning of the game as they will recall without enough gold to buy the most important item in the game for them.  The strong Junglers are being left basically scratched while everyone else is being nerfed severely.\r\n\r\nNow what is my problem with this?  I should not feel obligated to play x Jungler because that Jungler outclasses so many others.  I should play my Jungler because I want to, and I should be rewarded for playing my Jungler (unless it's Urgot).  However, this change means that some of my favorite Junglers, like Nocturne and Nautilus will be outclassed, and I will be punished for playing a champion who cannot keep up with the small group of Junglers who can find means to reliably acquire 100 more gold before recalling.  In fact, I am being punished for playing a champion who cannot clear 4-5 Jungle camps before recalling.  The Jungle is now punishing champion choices, and that is unprecedented.  Riot has never released a change which promotes a champion choice while punishing players for choosing other champions.  \r\n\r\nI would like to hear everyone's opinion on this matter, but please keep this civil.  Respect my opinion, and I will give you the same respect.","replies":[{"poster":"SanKakU","date":"2015-01-25T19:31:45.507+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"I Main Swain","date":"2015-01-25T22:29:18.421+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"People aren't backing asap to get the upgrade, they are backing because their hp level demands backing, meaning their income is limited to a specified amount at first back, which is now not enough to purchase an item which they really have to have to stay in the game as far as gold, xp, and jungle pressure are concerned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeeDark","date":"2015-01-26T08:32:15.471+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to recall at some point, so the time you spend doing so evens out either way.

Taking an extra 2hp5 isn't going to make a difference by your second clear. Hell it hardly makes one in your first. Take less damage from neutral monsters is always good, oh wait that's what you have a machete for. Coincidentally it does that so you can free up your mastery points for more armor which reduces jungle damage to begin with (let's not forget champs or anything) - and yes, it's enough that it's noticeably more than taking alternative masteries.\n\nNext time you talk out your ass, at least try to have your facts straight and be coherent first.","replies":[{"poster":"Alpharite","date":"2015-01-26T21:15:59.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your first sentence was fucking gold!","replies":[{"poster":"MrPerson10","date":"2015-02-02T04:06:32.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CausticDeceiver,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=sK3A2FlL,comment-id=0000000000010000000100010001,timestamp=2015-01-26T21:15:59.828+0000)\n>\n> Your first sentence was fucking gold!\n\n;)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nin10do0014","date":"2015-01-26T04:54:59.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please, please.

No, I don't think the solo lanes will like it, but it might have to be a \"you let me do this and I'll favor you with ganks, and if you don't I won't gank for you\" thing.\n\nThe stated reason for the price hike is that junglers who get first blood snowball too fast, but the change seems like a huge hit to any jungler who can't get first blood. It also locks in the junglers who can into having to play aggressively early so they can get an upgrade first back.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MPendragon","date":"2015-01-26T05:04:12.286+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Theoretically, you start Gromp.\n\n1: Leash or no leash, smite gromp, use one health potion.\n2: Fight blue.\n3: Go kill scuttler, and give yourself some time to regenerate some health. \n4: Go back to kill wolf camp, don't use potion.\n5: Recall to base. \n\nOk, now i've been practicing this on an account that isn't even level 30 yet, and i'm able to do what I just described with 1 health potion, sometimes I use the 2nd potion if I didn't get a leash.\n\nI have 530-550 Gold. As it is now,* I can buy my upgrade for 350G and completely fill up on potions*, and even buy a stealth ward or a vision ward if I want to wait around for the extra gold.\n\nWith this nerf in the future, I will still be able to upgrade my item and purchase 2-3 more potions. \n\n6: Go back to Red, scout it.

In most cases, i'm correct. But if you take the time to kill Scuttler before challenging Wolves you should have regenerated enough health to challenge them without requiring that health potion.\n\nWhat does this mean? Now you have additional gold, and an extra health potion! Woohoo! Now you can buy your jungling item and more health potions to snowball yourself to farming success.\n\nYou can PayPal me later.","replies":[{"poster":"zliplus","date":"2015-01-26T18:08:38.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gromp -> Blue -> Red is a more likely (and better) route for anyone not super afraid of getting ganked at red.","replies":[{"poster":"MPendragon","date":"2015-01-26T21:54:40.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=zliplus,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=sK3A2FlL,comment-id=000f0001,timestamp=2015-01-26T18:08:38.686+0000)\n>\n> Gromp -> Blue -> Red is a more likely (and better) route for anyone not super afraid of getting ganked at red.\n\nSure you could do that.\n\nWhen are you backing to base though? \nDo you have 21/9 into Support masteries, to get the extended buff times?\n\nIf not, which I generally don't, I do in some minor cases, and that's only rarely.\nIf you're losing 45 seconds on your buff timer, just backing up to base, it's really a waste of time that you have that red buff though.

When you come back, you have the option of smiting birds for a gank.\n\n2) If you don't have too much trouble clearing, it gives you the option of ganking immediately at level 3 with double buff. Usually you'd need a champ that has over 50% hp and preferably with some health pot left and isn't a terrible ganker (obviously). 0/21/9 is indeed a likely mastery setup for this as well, since it also boosts health pots along with buff times.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nin10do0014","date":"2015-01-26T13:59:30.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is actually an interesting route, but I would like to ask about your Experience rate.

(As you should do. Laners generally get pissed off if you're doing this, and I honestly just tell them to go screw themselves, because they're clearly idiots for not giving farm that will be sacrificed in any event to their teammates.) Lane experience always gives you more experience than jungle experience does, hence why laners generally are higher levels than the jungler is.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
