Examples of AD being burst : Lucain, Graves, Tristana. Examples of more sustained AP Carries: Cassio, Azir, Ryze (pre-rework).\n\nExample of why your definition is poor, a tank peeling for a carry and actually keeping them doing damage is more of an MVP to people who know what is doing on than just looking at damage and going \"OMG the carry is real!\". This is a problem I see alot, instead of being able to recognize other people being \"MVP\" players only look at damage and go wow he carried, I am the MVP more games as Thresh than as an ADC.","replies":[{"poster":"Nin10do0014","date":"2015-04-16T04:33:34.610+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe you misinterpreted the context of \"Carry\" in the terms list.  Carrying as an action involves making plays which benefit the team significantly, whether you are a Tank, Bruiser, or even a Support.  It is not about the high damage output.
