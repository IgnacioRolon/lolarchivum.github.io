However, don't try to look at this as a tally system where if you ever reach X number of leaves, you get penalized.  The system looks at how often you leave games within a set period of time before leveraging penalties against the account.  We never punish a player for leaving a single game, we know that life happens (such as Fire Drills).  You only receive these penalties if you consistent leave/AFK in games.\n\nHopefully this alleviates some confusion!  Reply back if you still have any questions!","replies":[{"poster":"UnsealedZangetsu","date":"2015-11-03T18:49:19.823+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So X number of leaves equals 1 over riot server issues and no other d/cs in the last 2-3 months.

Win or lose, your team was still in a 4v5 scenario for an extended period of time, which isn't fair to them. If you keep getting dced for some reason, then I would suggest to try finding out the reason why you keep getting dced so that you can potentially fix that problem there as well.\n\nAs for your case SorasMemories, LB automatically comes with built in leniency for these kinds of things. As long as  you're not frequently leaving/afking in games then you have nothing to worry about there really. Otherwise, if you know what the problem is and refuse to fix it, then it's all on your head there and no one else's.","replies":[{"poster":"UnsealedZangetsu","date":"2015-11-03T18:54:37.236+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If by \"built in leniency\" you mean a 20 min wait for 5 games over an \"unknown d/c reason\" and that being the only d/c in the last 3 months of steady games.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Slushi Simcambi","date":"2015-01-31T01:15:54.986+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's hilarious, sorry, but pretty funny.\n\nYou should be fine, one AFK won't sink you.

There is leniency in the system for emergencies (I would count a fire drill as one), but if you're not intentially leaving, it'll just be a little blip that won't really affect your standing--especially if you're a long term player with a good record for not leaving.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Mr Creelman","date":"2016-05-25T06:16:40.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep. the riot community as a whole as become so sensitive and touchy on subjects as far as this or anything else even close to related to constructive criticism.

Life does happen outside of the game and sometimes u cannot forsee these issues. Especially when riot themselves have had soooo much trouble with lag and ping issues. Sometimes its just a bad time. Wouldnt the more useful way of solving this be to develop a system to keep the game balanced even if a teamate gets dcd? maybe a finely tuned bot that could be used as a sub? This wouldnt be perfect of course but it would be something. Maybe even some way of allowing one player on the team to give orders to the bot sort of like they do in FPS where u can order him to defend or attack or assist certain locations or players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sharkster1","date":"2015-01-31T16:52:57.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see why I would need to appeal for an AFK, my team asks me to do it all the time!","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2015-01-31T01:02:26.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nin10do0014,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=YhbJRasU,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-01-30T03:59:18.014+0000)\n>\n> I had a fire drill in my dorm, and I had to evacuate the building.\n\nI wonder if you go to the same dorm as one of my friends.
