I sit there watching replays and LCS, and make sure to learn from them. I try to eliminate simple mistakes, and when someone points out my mistake I apologize and actively try to fix it mid game.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, when people refuse to acknowledge or fix their mistakes, I tend to be angry.\r\n\r\nTypically I first try to suggest a change they could make such as\r\n**\r\n &quot;hey u should ward tri&quot;\r\n\r\n &quot;pls watch out for my mias&quot;\r\n\r\n &quot;careful jg is botside dont get ganked&quot;**\r\n\r\nand upon their inevitable ignorance, I start to soft flame. I don&#039;t expect them to agree with all my suggestions and I&#039;m not a control freak, but people should be reminded of simple things like warding and watching your map.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not a bad person, I&#039;m extremely positive and love learning, but sometimes people&#039;s refusal to adapt and improve their game play gets to me. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m curious as to what other players think.\r\n\r\nDo you bother giving suggestions to teammates?\r\n\r\nWhat do you think the source of toxicity and flame is?\r\n\r\nPlease give your insights I&#039;d love to start some discussions!","replies":[{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2018-08-11T09:26:11.760+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"I simply started playing online games in a different era.

This game isnt just the issue of chat toxicity.  The reason elo hell exists is because people do what they want.   Elo hell has the possibility of being a contributer to such negative behavior.  Players invest their time to win lp only to lose what was hard won cuz someone doesnt know or care about how to play a ranked game.  They dont listen to logic on how to play as a team.  If we have a team game, lets create ways to incentivize good team play rather than have them figure it out on their own.\n\nGood Scenario below:\n\nADC is behind because they 4v2 and are now down 0-3, Bot Lane tries to help out team and point out what team could do better.  Animosity between teammates develops because people dont like to listen to others --- teammates start to steal farm from ADC cuz farm is good and \"adc is too far behind to come back\" -- then end game... say --- why is your cs so bad? (much more harshly)\n\nIt is like they dont even understand how the game is played????\n\nToxicity is more than chat --- game play toxicity can translate to verbal toxicity.

Many will see your title and just downvote you or some will even insult you or say stuff that are not constructive and that can be irritating.\n\nThe problem, from what I see and felt, is that the origin of a flamer comes from expectations. \n\nA player with alot of expectations will get mad easily because his expectation will not meet the reality of the situation he is in, thus, creating anger towards the players who did not meet his minimal requirements. On the other hand of the spectrum, a tilt-proof player is usually someone who has low expectations. They dont get as mad as the toxic player because almost everything will go beyond his expectations, thus creating a good surprise almost always to this individual. \n\nThis applies also in real life and if you had a hard time understanding my point, just think of somewhere in your life where you had expectations and another even where you had low expectations. Tell me, which one angered you the most and which one was more bearable.","replies":[{"poster":"John0728","date":"2018-08-28T00:05:50.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo NamiAndTentacles, did you used to be NamiFishHentai?","replies":[{"poster":"Sexy Fish Nami","date":"2018-09-04T19:16:26.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2018-08-11T13:55:30.655+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright.

But we can go even deeper. Toxicity comes from expectations being violated. That's the root of it. Be it from expecting teammates to act in a certain way, or expecting a play or the laning phase to go a certain way. This manifests in a lot of ways.\n\nWhen you put the effort in to accept your mistakes and learn from them, you're being a great person. You would also expect others to do the same, because it is the reasonable thing to do. But when people violate that expectation you have of them, it upsets you because you feel like they should have handled it that way and instead they acted like a brat.\n\nSometimes people play consciously like you do, but many people often play on auto-pilot. They don't want to think too hard or have to work hard for it, they just want the flashy plays and the win without having to put in the work for it. They expect their play to go well, they expect to win laning phase, they expect to get fed and snowball. When those things don't happen, that (entirely unreasonable) expectation gets violated and it upsets them.\n\nIf you're looking for ways to reduce your own toxicity, a great place to start is with how you set your expectations. If you set your expectations about a game based only on things you can control (like getting a certain amount of farm or keeping certain places warded or using chat only for encouragement) then you won't have your expectations violated as often and you won't be upset as easily. It's hard to accept, but we can't control our teammates, if they're going to play like jerks then there really isn't anything we can do about it. The most we can do is offer a kind word of encouragement here and there and hope that they focus, cooperate, and don't tilt.","replies":[]},{"poster":"C9 Dinozor","date":"2018-08-14T16:09:31.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea i just got permabanned haha, on this account, do i even get to post? hahahha\nits hard giving good feedback/advice without being critical\nmost players get really offended when you talk about their playstyle\nw/e im banned","replies":[]},{"poster":"LadyNinjaFox","date":"2018-08-12T18:58:04.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Charles Gnarwin,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=j9EQz8UE,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-08-11T09:10:06.383+0000)\n>\n> **Sometimes friends wonder why I&amp;#039;m so toxic.**\n> **Here&amp;#039;s my perspective in case anyone was curious about the mind of some toxic players.**\n> \n> I think it&amp;#039;s because of my investment in this game.
