Bots as far as the eye can see.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I&#039;ve got myself a second account, only level eleven and all that jazz, but we can discuss the rampancy of bots in ARAMS, and sometimes even Summoner&#039;s rift amongst low-level accounts? I&#039;ll play six games in a row with the exact same account, report it six times, and then it is still present in the seventh? Why is it that I can report someone for a racial slur, and receive a message a game later that action has been taken, but bots take days on end to get banned?\r\n\r\nIt isn&#039;t like they&#039;re hard to spot either. They&#039;ll always have double digit deaths by the ten-minute mark because they just run in, sit at the tower until minions spawn, then just sit next to the creep wave spamming spells until a champion shows up. Then the full AP Soraka just tunnel visions on the 14/2 Jhin and gets popped like a balloon under a steam roller. I do my part to report the bots, but is there not a more aggressive manner in which to treat these individuals? Can&#039;t we ban consistent offenders IP or MAC address? Because I&#039;m certain, thirty people a day don&#039;t just randomly start going &#039; Hey, I think I&#039;m gonna bot an account today!&#039;","replies":[{"poster":"DaenrysTargaryen","date":"2017-09-02T15:31:20.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bots get banned in waves not reports that is why you still play with them","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darkdemon653","date":"2017-09-02T15:09:00.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Riot lets them get to level 30 before banning them.

In that low a level for an account I sure as hell didn't know what I was doing or even what to buy items wise.  I didn't even know towers did damage before level 3 since the game calls it a kill if you take even a single point of damage from an enemy.\n\nOn behalf of new players, please play on your original account and stop being mean to people trying to show interest in a game they know drasticly less than you about.","replies":[]}]}
