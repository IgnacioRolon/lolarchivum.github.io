That plus the one key I had sitting around from earlier makes 2 boxes and 3 keys. _(If you're wondering why I bought two keys when I already have one, I don't know. I just wanted to get the RP counter to zero, but in hindsight I should've bought a third chest instead...)_\n\nAnyways, I went to the crafting menu and hit the button that said \"Open 2\" boxes.\n\nThe first box contained, in order; Commando J4 shard -> chest -> emote -> key.\n\nThe second had just an Order of the Lotus Karma shard.\n\nAfter that, I'm left with 0 chests and 1 key, like what I began with, so where did the alleged free chest and key disappear to?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-17T23:46:27.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, I looked into this for you and do see quite a bit of goodies but no missing chests.  \n\nYour 2 chests opened Comando Jarvan IV skin shard, Vamporo Emote (awesome!), and a chest within a chest.

Thanks for clearing that up.\n\nI'm not sure what the point of it displaying a chest and key as loot is if said chest and key are just automatically opened anyway, though.","replies":[]}]}]}
