Saying it's a joke is just ridiculous.\n\n>  it fails to be a usable rune on many tanks severely restricting the pool of usable runes.\n\nEven Tanks without heal or shield at all still have an interesting and generic option on that line: Overgrowth, so there is no dead Rune, and that's enough.

And this isn't even taking into account that the situation is far from binary  ---either you need Second Wind or not. So in some relatively hard match-ups, but not the hardest of all, where Second Wind would be nice to have but not absolutely necessary, you really have a choice: opting for an easy lane versus betting on the late game with Overgrowth.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2018-01-07T01:45:24.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">5% healing is nowhere near a joke.

Zac Aatrox and Sion all have self healing that doesn't benefit from this rune, when they revive they have their HP set to an amount and the game heals them to that amount. If Zac has 4k HP and revives at 50% he'll heal for 2k HP in the endgame stats, nothing in the game will change this 2k HP value assuming you're not hitting his blobs.

Allowing an assassin to dive effectively, at the cost of say the lethality or magic shield you'd get from a different item to try to make plays. And the activation would only work for that champion so a gank would still be risky for multiple people.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AZ Frost","date":"2017-11-30T02:29:40.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot needs to look at items and see what items are NOT being used at all (even very little) and figure out why.
