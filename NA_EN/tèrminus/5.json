Which only puts a small dent in the number of champions I actually want to play.\r\n\r\nThere&#039;s the free rotation, but you can&#039;t earn chests with free champions, and with the system how it is now, you really want to be earning as much loot as possible to actually unlock things before the heat death of the universe.","replies":[]}
