Skarner's is point blank, but I'm not sure if they'll change it when it's Skarner's turn to be updated, and Tahm has to attack someone three times to eat them.\nHowever, the problem is that Malzahar was designed to build damage, not build durability and set up fights or picks like Skarner or Tahm or Warwick, and even Urgot to a lesser degree.\n\nThey could probably make it like a ground sweep kind of skillshot where you pause for a split second, do some sound effect or whatever, and then the laser would scour the area in a line up to a certain range and \"lock on\" to the first champion it hits and then do the suppression tether for a couple seconds.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broken Bandle","date":"2018-01-23T01:19:23.043+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you added something like this, it would actually have to make Malzahar's ult a LONGER duration as a pay off for his skill and properly using his kit, not shorten it.

It's not some fancy mini-game, and it's not like Malzahar's spells are hard to land.\n\nRealistically, though, he'd need more work than this.

Back then the hatred towards him was way less. Back then malz had more base dmg on his ulti ( and more ration on his ulti ). His kit also had more mana sustain since his e mana regain didnt scale with his mana.  ( it was flat amount) . As for his q i really dont have a problem dodging it. Its pretty telegraphed and takes kinda some time to deal dmg. Even my opponents seem to find it easy to dodge it. Oh btw his q also silenced for 3 secs compared to the 2.  The only thing that i can find something to hate him about is his passive. Otherwise he is weaker (dmg wise) compared to the old one.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2018-01-22T23:16:20.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this damaged five times by a unique ability or just damaged by Malzahar's abilities 5 times?
