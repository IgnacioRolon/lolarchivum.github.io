The active is also really nice.  I do not care for the changes to the support items.  I think it has more to do with removing support items that can be abused by other roles then it does giving supports vision without buying a sightstone. \n\nWith that said, I would prefer shield batter to be added to a supportive type item in the game and not as a rune.  For those who know how to use the active it is really strong in skirmishes.  As a rune it can still be abused by other non-tank roles.  I think it should require an opportunity cost in game so it is available to front line champs.  I don't even mind it being available to jg and top, but having a regenerating shield on a carry is an incredible amount of sustain.  It is essentially a free HP / regen.\n\nEdit:  I do like that members of the community are discussing this and I hope it encourages Riot to reconsider and keep the passive and active of Shield Battery in game.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-01-19T17:25:59.017+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like to see Face of the Mountain return as a standalone item that's got lower stats on it, or either something simple like just HP, etc. A simple item that just grants the Shield Battery and the dual shielding would make me happy.","replies":[{"poster":"JohnnyFallDown","date":"2018-01-19T17:55:43.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I keep thinking it could be an item that has Aegis of the legion and crystal bracer.
