Sona's poke is also very telegraphed and easily blocked by E, and it's also low range. Once it's used, Riven has pretty much free reign for a fast combo with W.\n\nThat is, unless she was a shit Riven.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project omen","date":"2017-06-18T14:25:27.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sona in general is a troll pick but not in lower elos. Sona mid however: still a troll pick because there are way better picks but as long as you won then it's ok I guess.","replies":[]},{"poster":"StoryDuck","date":"2017-06-18T13:06:22.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You shouldn't be flamed but Sona has some serious issues when in mid.

If your lane opponent lets you Q+Staccato on cooldown without them trading back and hitting you even harder that is honestly on them and they would have lost to any other mid lane pick anyway. Even someone like Katarina can Q+E you when you go to poke and chunk you for more than your Staccato since you don't do anything besides run away after you poke since Q has a fairly long cooldown (and doesn't do damage on its own) before 6.","replies":[]}]}
