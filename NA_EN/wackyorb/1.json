I don't do that anymore obviously, i play jungle so this doesn't happen. And when it does i happily double jungle.

You start at level 2 honor and there are 3 checkpoints from level 0 (you were suspended/banned) to level 1, level 1 to 2, all the way to 5. chat restrictions take you from whatever level you were, in most cases level 2 or 3 and drops you to level 1 checkpoint 0. You need to then prove you are honorable enough in game to keep yourself calm and work towards winning every game you play. Everyone has a chance at honor level 5 this way, just that people who deserve it with good behavior get it. Hopefully this helps :)","replies":[{"poster":"DrTeath","date":"2018-03-30T09:29:08.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My mistake , should have fact checked myself.","replies":[{"poster":"Odysseus263","date":"2018-03-30T09:31:13.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DrTeath,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=aH2ewM96,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2018-03-30T09:29:08.425+0000)\n>\n> My mistake , should have fact checked myself.\n\nno problem. i have a dirty habit of not fact checking myself sometimes. i find it is a common thing that's why i wasn't so mean in my comment. i believe in education > aggression. that's why my passion is teaching but i'll never be a professor.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
