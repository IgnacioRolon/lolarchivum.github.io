But i also just want to be honest with any future or past teammates. I WILL NOT stop this &quot;trolling&quot; you speak of. Norms is where i go to have fun after grinding in ranked. And this past week i grinded A LOT. I deserve to try out AP LEONA every now and then since I&#039;m ALWAYS playing by the rules. Go ahead and report me for going 2/10/12 or whatever it was. I played to the BEST of my ability and that&#039;s all i will give you. I will not KISS your shoes or BEG for forgiveness. I will play my best and do my best, and i expect the same in return. So go ahead and report me, but won&#039;t stop FIGHTING. FIGHTING for a more FREE tomorrow!\r\n\r\n I wish you all the same freedom that i feel some day.\r\n\r\n {{sticker:katarina-love}}","replies":[]}
