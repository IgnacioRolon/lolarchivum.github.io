I know I&#039;m not supposed to be the best or whatever. But I&#039;ve been playing long enough to realize that I&#039;m always the person on my team with the worst kda and the lowest damage output. My positions I like to play are mid and bot, so I usually play high damage champs. I know I have a problem with positioning, but I&#039;ve worked on that and I&#039;ve gotten a bit better, but I&#039;m still always the worst. The thing is that after a while of just being the worst player on my team, shouldn&#039;t I be placed with lower level people? This is especially true with ranked. I keep winning because I get carried or my support is really good. I started ranked at silver V, but it took forever to get demoted to bronze I, I was practically begging to be demoted because I just wasn&#039;t good enough and it took FOREVER to get demoted. They gave me so many times and &quot;protected&quot; me against being demoted. Bronze I is a much better fit, but I&#039;m still always the worst player on my team. I&#039;m really unsure of what to do. I mean, at some point riot has to be like &quot;okay, let&#039;s give this guy some easier people to play against&quot;, but it never happens.

I think you will find much better success by changing roles.  I know I'm bad at this game compared to my rank (gold 1) so I avoid difficult and squishy champions.  Because I know that my mechanical skill is lacking, I play champions like Taric, Nautilus, Amumu, Tahm Kench, Braum, Tryndamere, and Maokai.  With champions like this, you can screw up and not instantly die for it.  The biggest parts of these champions is deciding when to use high value abilities that are basically guaranteed to be effective.  They are Taric ult, Nautilus ult, Amumu ult, Tahm devour, Braum shield, Tryn ult, and Maokai ult.\n\nWhen you are playing a squishy mage, assassin, or adc, one misclick means your instant death.  Even to this day after starting in bronze 3 back in season 3 and climbing to gold 1 now, I still can't play squishies at all.  I probably play ADC at a low silver level as an almost platinum player.

The reason why you're the worst player even in lower ranks might have to do with my first point. You don't really understand the game which leads to playing \"the reaction game\".

Hm, the best advice I can give is to stick with it. If you play regularly I can almost guarantee you will get better.\n\nYou can play a bunch of bot/custom games with you favorite champs to help you get comfortable with them; just be careful, doing so will also deny you realistic human reaction from the enemy and won't let you experience how you champ works when on equal footing with the enemy.\n\nI personally learned a lot about the game from playing ARAM. It lets you try out new builds and runes since the games are quick, you can practice teamfights (since that's all it is), and you get to experience a bunch of new champs. Even if you don't plan on playing them in normal games, it helps to learn first-hand the strengths and weaknesses of specific champs and classes (assassin, adc, etc.).\n\nYou can also try to improve your macro play with simple things like cs'ing and focusing objectives over kills, to more advance things like map awareness (\"the enemy mid disappeared. where is he going?\") and wave manipulation (ex. freezing the wave when you are ahead so the enemy has to put themselves in danger to get their own farm). Macro play can be more difficult to learn because you won't necessarily learn it just by playing. You have to actively think about it and condition yourself to remember it. You can learn more about macro skills from instructional videos. \n\nI personally like to watch pros or high elo streamers from time to time to so I can pick up on new skills. Try to figure out why they make certain decisions if they or a commentator doesn't explain it.\n\nTo end with something more tangible: buy red wards throughout the game on any champ if you have extra money (I put them at the top of item pages for my favorite champs so I don't forget), get the canon minions (they are worth far more than normal minions), and pay attention to important enemy cooldowns. For example, if I'm against a Lucian I know he is maxing his Q so if he uses it on minions I can try to pick a fight with him knowing that he won't be able to use his powerful spell in the trade. If Lux uses her Q and E I know I can fight her with any champ because I can doge her last damage spell (R) since I won't be CC'ed.\n\nSorry, that ended up being a little long.

Some people who regularly get far ahead and have a high K/D ratio aren't great at closing out games and thus their 50% win rate is a result even in silver. They carry the game 50% of the time and 50% of the time they throw and their team loses the game. Players like this usually lose quickly if they don't get a lead from the start. High variance play style means they have high highs and low lows. If you're a more consistent player it's more difficult to notice the impact your plays are having on the game as a whole. \n\n2nd duoing can cause this phenomena. For example when I play a lot with my brothers then I notice that I'm always the worst player on the team for the next few weeks. They are all better than me so it brings up my MMR higher than it should be. \n\nWhile in your situation it sounds like the game probably placed you too highly in your ranked games this happens to me in normals where I'll go 20-30 games in a row as the worst player in the game. In ranked once you find your proper ELO then that probably won't happen but in norms it can get really bad.","replies":[{"poster":"gimmerockets","date":"2018-08-08T05:44:19.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I knew cueing with friends might be an issue here...yeah, I duo with my girlfriend a lot and she's SIV and I sometimes cue with my friend, he's DIII, so that could definitely be a problem then.

You were staying at silver 5 because of the safety net. \n\nHowever low silver, nearly all of silver except 2 and 1, is insanely fucking random matching. The games are incredibly inconsistent. Its not hard to just go neutral and get carried every other game.... or lose 6 and then win 6. Riot tries to keep you at 50% too. I always found it would keep me about 10 games negative wins.\n\nIt is actually really difficult to get kicked out of silver 5. I've done it a couple times and then instantly got back into silver because high bronze matching is fine. The high bronze games are much much better than silver 5. MUCH MUCH MUCH BETTER. Like, getting into silver 5 feels like FALLING down the ladder into bronze 3. No joke. Its insanely bad.\n\nWhich is another perhaps piece of the puzzle. Its hard to know, but if you actually do know what you're doing- for instance do you see other players mistakes before they make them? There are a lot of monkeys in there, and many times they just make terrible decisions.\n\nI've had sooo many times where the jungle has literally walked through wards, i've pinged out my support and i'm back at the turret, and hes still thinking i'm going to follow up on his engage. Sooooo many times.\n\nIn theory, if matching is actually equal chance per team to win... then you going even with your lane should mean you win more often than lose. Personally I feel like this is simply false. I've played way way way too many games of teams feeding their asses off to think that is remotely true.\n\nWill the game try to keep you at a 50% winrate? Absolutely. Will the games be matched well so that you have a 50/50 chance to win, hell no. No fucking way.\n\n\nMore than likely you are better than you think you are, simply because you think you are bad- which means you notice your mistakes. So assuming that you learn and correct those, like you talked about, you shouldn't have an issue with climbing. However, I think if you play on one account, the system will never let you climb once you plateau.\n\nI don't know what it is, but I know I'm far, far, far, far, far better than I was my first season- and I still can't seem to get past the fucking gatekeepers in silver. Eventually I came to the conclusion after climbing to silver 3 and then always getting a massive loss streak... that something is fucked up with matching. I consistently get games where I win 6, lose 6, I've studied and studied and studied myself. I know i'm playing consistent.\n\nMeaning matching is fucked. I've started to see patterns in it too and talked to a lot of other players that experience the exact same fluxuations. I've tried playing lots of games, 1-2 games a day to make sure I wasn't tired or something. Doesn't matter.\n\nThats said, you will unquestionably improve by doing this.

I ended up basically 1 tricking jax to a 58% winrate and getting to my promos for s5 but failing them before moving into season 8.  I basically only played a handful of champs who's style fit w/ me, for me that was WW, Jax and Xin mainly (gapclosers burst and some form of cc, sustain was also a factor i looked at too).  \n\nAs i played mainly those champs i got a better understanding of the game and a better mastery of those champs and their matchups, which is a big first step in being able to learn and familiarize yourself with other champs you might enjoy.  And now in season 8 i finally made it to silver (though its really volatile at low silver so i havent broken thru to s4 yet), and the pool of champs i can play respectably and make a reasonable contribution to the team is much bigger (and i've also found many more i enjoy just as much as i did WW Jax and xin).\n\nSo that'd be my main advice, keep playing and stick to a small handful of champs that you like and fit your playstyle (since you mentioned positioning maybe trying adcs who have a repositioning ability to help them out might be worth trying {{champion:81}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:133}}  are 3 that come to mind) and try to play those champs primarily til start feeling more confident with them, maybe it wont but I'm betting it'll unlock you and you'll get more comfortable with the game over time and naturally improve.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Power Cosmic","date":"2018-08-07T00:50:21.067+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play mages or similar (miss fortune)  to learn the game.
