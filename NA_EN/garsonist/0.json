I have repaired the game 3 times, as well as reinstalling and checking the permissions. Is there another resolution to this problem? I know that it is a common issue that has been solved before, but I have scoured the boards for similar posts without a fix for my own client. Thanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"garsonist","date":"2016-07-31T21:16:52.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I fixed it!

Repairing the game would fix up game files and not your connection, so it wouldn't necessarily resolve this issue.
