When I go 16/4/12 and we lose and I am forced to watch my precious LP vanish before my eyes, I can&#039;t help but think that there must be a better way to rank me up through the tiers. I&#039;m in B4 right now and I go positive 9/10 games...how is this even allowed in bronze?! Please, work on a new way to have summoners work their way up the Elo because its getting old trying to carry a Carpet V team every game. League is fun and all, but whats the point of trying your hardest if you don&#039;t get rewarded for it? I have been in bronze for months with at least 100+ games and yet, IM STILL IN BRONZE 4!! This is getting old...","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-02-12T12:23:00.669+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You say you go positive 9/10 games, but looking at it it's more like a roll of the dice whether you do or not. Running even isn't a good goal anyway, your playstyle is probably far too risky.\n\nI recommend slimming down your champion pool to just a few per role so that you can master them. Read guides and watch high elo players so you can learn the most effective builds, including Runes, Masteries, Summoner Spells and skill order.\n\nWard more and keep an eye on where the enemy is (and isn't) so you can take objectives that they leave open. Don't engage fights with something that you already know beats you every time. The goal is the Nexus, which you reach through their towers and inhibitors; you don't need to get a huge amount of kills to accomplish that, and trying to can get in the way.\n\nDon't ever blame your team; you're in Bronze 4, you're going to get Bronze 4 teammates. Focus on improving your own play every game instead of on how bad you think they are. The opposing team gets players from the same pool, so they'll tend to be average for that elo too; you have to be the one player in that match better than the average.","replies":[{"poster":"Succub√∫s GF","date":"2017-02-12T12:32:00.562+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly though it does feel harder to win games in ranked, does it not? As it is a team game, if you get the worse team, they get the snowball advantage. This happens frequently and I believe the statistic was fb turret is 70% chances of winning the game. The game in its entirety has turned very snowballey and in my opinion has made it harder to climb with bad teammates, just my thoughts","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-02-12T12:38:41.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Harder than what, Normals? Well yeah, that's because people care about winning more when they have a rank and rewards at stake, and it's a good thing.\n\nI don't know about FB tower statistics, I focus on the game in front of me. My experience has been pretty even back-and-forth games most of the time, but again, I don't care about statistics I care about the match I'm in and doing better the next time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unreformed Shaco","date":"2017-02-12T12:42:15.185+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Not in low elo.\n\nLow ELO snowballing ain't shit.\n\n\nBronze doesn't know what to do with advantages, so the game is very even until a very big lead.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"III BAKURYU III ","date":"2017-02-12T22:45:04.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When did you go 16-4-12?  \n  If you have 16 kills and only 4 deaths it's not your team's fault that you lost or are losing it's you own fault dude. You play mostly LB, Kat, Ziggs, Draven champions that yeah they can get kills but do need a team to follow up and in Bronze you don't have a team and you don't have people that know how to follow up, instead you must carry 4 random scrubs that you  need to carry plain and simple. \n\n  On average you go around 6-8-8 KDA per game in your League Ranked career and 6.7(K)  8.6(D)  8.4(A)  118.5(CS) this year \non average so you just need to stop dying yourself and don't say \" I get 6 kills and 0 deaths until my teammates feed and and die 8 times because of them\" if that's the case you really need to start learning how to get 1 kill and turn it into leads that matter and not just kills to boost up your KDA but instead get objectives.  \n\nDo I think the Ranked needs to change - YES mainly the get 100 LP you don't need to play 3-5 more games to get out of that certain division/tier but that's about it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2017-02-12T22:45:54.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you were good at the game you wouldn't have been placed in bronze 4.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unreformed Shaco","date":"2017-02-12T12:40:36.368+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why do you mention your KDA? Carry is about leading and making good calls, not winning your lane.\n\nI went 0-13-4 or something as Heimer the other day, but setting up all three lanes to push was what won the game.\n\nFocus more on objective control and wave management and you will find you climb faster than going 20-0 every game.
