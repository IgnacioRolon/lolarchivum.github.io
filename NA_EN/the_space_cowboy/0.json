This time I&#039;ll keep it simple. {{champion:222}}  had two minor quality of life nerfs done by cloak{{item:1018}}  and dagger {{item:1042}} before her q and r where appropriately nerfed. I don&#039;t want the big nerfs rolled back, but i want these subtle changes reversed.\n\n1) Chomper vision. Once deployed the chompers used to give maybe 300 units of vision, and would expose trapped foes. Then it went to no vision, and now it is only exposing trapped foes i believe. I really miss using my chompers to get vision accross Forrest and base walls for tricky plays and picks. Please add vision again.\n\n2) Fish bones. I just saw a red post from our favorite rioter defending auto attacks staying with a champion that flashes or leaves range.... However with fish bone rockets if your target leaves range or gets in a bush the animation cancles and you get a thwunk sound of limpness from your deathlauncher. Before these changes once you right clicked a champ that champ was getting a rocket, which was especially important when fighting kalista or tristana. Now im thwunking away like a dork. Please give my rockets the same coding as other AA&#039;s.\n\nSo riot and fellow jinx mains answer me this:\nCan you confirm these changes?\nDo you think they balance her or make her clunky?\n\nP.s. sorry you get summoned like a balance poltergeist every day but we appreciate your communication.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-13T00:37:26.067+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> 1) Chomper vision.

Please add vision again.\n\nI know it sucks to lose something that you once had, but I actually think this is a change in the right direction. Imo, vision is something we give away too freely to champions on average for the sake of them \"feeling good\". More often than not, I don't think \"feeling good\" is a justification of power. For vision specifically, putting vision on a bunch of skills that really aren't about vision just cheapens the experience of champions with skills that are supposed to be about it. As an example I know will be unpopular with people that main her, I would love it if Orianna's ball did not give vision. Say that's 5% of her power currently, I'd rather she just had that power elsewhere.\n\n> 2) Fish bones.

The part about entering brush is consistent with other targeted spells and attacks in the game unless very specifically scripted to do otherwise. If you basic attack as anyone else, and the target leaves vision into a brush during the windup, the attack will not fire. Same for targeted spells. If you're absolutely certain that enemies leaving your range is canceling your rockets, I can ask Gypsylord about that when I see him, because I'm pretty sure he would have to do something fancy to make that even possible.","replies":[{"poster":"The Space Cowboy","date":"2015-08-13T00:59:22.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Big culprits are flash and tristanas rocket jump as well as the bush. Thank you soooo much for looking at the post even if we disagree on chomper vision (I'll just upgrade my trinket hehe). But ya I'm positive it gets cancelled only if the enemy escapes before the animation finishes. It's as though the targeting takes place at the end of the animation instead of on click, giving the user a thwunk of failure. Thanks again for being summoned my man!

Throw em in a bush or over a wall and you'll be able to see everything around them.\n\nThat said I do agree that them giving vision all the time is a tad questionable.  I think this for a different reason than repertoir however.  Putting vision on a lot of skills cheapens brush and wall interactions.  When you're fighting many of our champions, going over/around a wall or ducking into brush is a universal action accessible to all characters that creates a lot of play.  COOL JUKES YO\n\nWhen you're fighting one of the many characters who get vision for \"free\" brush and wall interactions go out the window.\n\nThat's not to say that champions shouldn't get vision on certain things, I'd just prefer that in the places we give it it has a meaningful cost (Twisted Fate's R CD), or reinforces an awesome/unique/core play pattern on the champion's kit that we'd like to boost up (Warwick seeing you when low and chasing you down)\n\nIf we were ever to do a \"vision pass\" on all our champs I'd look at Jinx's E as one of the skills that likely gives too much of it.  Chompers should probably always give vision on things they snare but her being able to use them as a free brush check (compared to W which you have to hit) is questionable to me.\n\nAs for the rockets, they're working as intended as far as I know and shouldn't be doing anything out of the ordinary.  I think the problem you may be running into is that rockets have a loooooong attack frame since they're so slow, which makes the moments when they're supposed to get canceled (champion leaves vision) happen more frequently and feel more noticeable when they happen.","replies":[{"poster":"The Space Cowboy","date":"2015-08-16T19:58:32.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I made a new thread in bugs about the chompers not giving vision in bushes. But you may see this first. I'm glad im not crazy, but i understand if you decide not to grant bush vision based on your comments. Hopefully you will add vision though, because trapping somebody in a bush is worthless at the moment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Space Cowboy","date":"2015-08-13T16:45:26.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll have to double check the chompers now. I swear the vision barely exposes the traps themselves but you're in a position to know better. Update: I was wrong. But i feel like there has been a time when there was less vision. I'll go throw my traps into things and report if I ever replicate it. Maybe I was imagining things.\n\nWith the rockets I was wondering if it was just the super slow animation, and now you have confirmed that is all that is going on. So thank you. This will inform our gameplay and I'll take it to heart while choosing weapons. That being said, would you consider smoothing it out? I know the rockets are strong but Id give up percentage ad for flat ad or ap for smoother gameplay. Although i may be alone there.

I agree jinx is good now, she still carries after lvl 9 and it's a healthy struggle to get there without feeding. Perhaps her fishbones canceling if it cant channel fully is a good balance to the rockets power and AOE.

Realistically she was only nerfed because of her synergy with the tank meta, and she's falling off (ish) now. \n\nI don't really think she needs the fish bones buff though. Her range is already really big, and late game when she 3 shots people, she does need some counterplay.\n\nThis also said, Lucian has needed much larger buffs for a much longer time. I am a Jinx main, but I do want to see him addressed first.","replies":[]}]}
