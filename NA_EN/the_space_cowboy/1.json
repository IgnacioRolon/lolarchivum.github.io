As much as I absolutely love Riot's recent additions and overhaul to the lore, there have been instances where a champion's presentation made them look completely different to how they play: Ekko, for example, is more of a light fighter in the lore, as he uses his Z-drive to try again and again, and his video depicts him dueling a vigilnaut, i.e. a tanky dude, but in practice he's an assassin whose long-cooldown ult is often used to kill.","replies":[{"poster":"TucuReborn","date":"2016-11-18T00:33:58.127+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"C\" is a burglar/thief.

He has a lot of the hallmarks of a light fighter, too: lots of situational defenses, persistent mobility, good DPS, a focus on autoattacks, etc. However, he was designed to be an assassin, which is also why he was given a high cooldown and a nuke on his ultimate. \n\nPerhaps this is something for another thread, but I feel Ekko would likely be better off if his kit received further changes to shift him into light fighter space, and among those changes I'd really like for his ult to have a much shorter cooldown, at a cost to its nuke and perhaps to his power elsewhere. We already have Zed for assassins who go all in for the kill and escape by pressing a button for a 1000+ range blink; I think it would be much more interesting if Ekko were closer to how he was in the video, i.e. a relatively weak, scrappy fighter who'd rewind time to give himself another chance.","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2016-11-18T04:37:37.655+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually rather like the sound of that, though it would require more changes than just what you suggested, having his ult be used more often for less pay off might be interesting.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Space Cowboy","date":"2016-11-17T21:06:34.880+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, Camille is the game&#x27;s first literal blade runner.\n\nI just pissed myself","replies":[{"poster":"The Space Cowboy","date":"2016-11-17T21:07:03.305+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"And I hope it is C, so Jinx can ship with her.","replies":[{"poster":"Zerenza","date":"2016-11-17T23:01:00.837+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"From the looks of it Camille wouldn't get along with Jinx as well as Vi or ekko would.
