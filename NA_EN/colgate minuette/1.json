Boom, you can heal his flag for some reason? I think this has something to do with the &quot;everything is minions&quot; &#039;joke&#039; Where the flag might actually be an invisible minion and thus soraka thinks she can heal it.\r\n\r\nShould deff be changed, I waste a lot of mana and health trying to heal a jarvan and accidentally hitting their flag cause for some reason the flags hitbox likes to  override jarvans.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-11-17T10:01:08.426+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a bug, it's a feature. Just like healing the minion 2 inches away from your adc right before he dies is a feature HEY DON'T YOU GIVE ME THAT LOOK! MINIONS NEED BACKUP! SHOW SOME RESPECT!\n\nLater they'll be adding heals for wards, inhibs, nexus, dead karthus, baron, enemy jarvan, poros, meeps, bushes, towers (but only when destroyed), \"yes\" votes, and internet connections. Games don't end, and players don't leave until Soraka says so!\n\n\\*high fives Lee Sin\\*","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-11-17T10:14:56.492+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the bug that ward rubble interacts with skillshots atm, I would not be surprised if you could heal it XD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-11-17T09:45:20.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Firstly, it's been a problem since forever, and I agree that it should be fixed\n\nBut for now it's an amazing tool to take advantage of and improve as Soraka\n\nA skilled Soraka player will always know how to assess a team fight, lane, trade or situation in a split second when holding down tilde and healing, click champion portraits, or just aiming without either is the best choice.","replies":[{"poster":"Colgate Minuette","date":"2015-11-17T10:26:48.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TeCoolMage,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=u5EN9zGZ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-11-17T09:45:20.588+0000)\n>\n> Firstly, it's been a problem since forever, and I agree that it should be fixed\n> \n> But for now it's an amazing tool to take advantage of and improve as Soraka\n> \n> A skilled Soraka player will always know how to assess a team fight, lane, trade or situation in a split second when holding down tilde and healing, click champion portraits, or just aiming without either is the best choice.\n\nNot complaining it happens very rarely I just didn't know if the bug was known so I pointed it out.","replies":[]}]}]}
