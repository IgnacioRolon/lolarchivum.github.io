Granted, not all adc players might fit this description, but the percentage is so high that I might as well assume it is the norm. \r\nThis message is not motivated, either, by the fact that out of the 8 games that I played today, the only 2 defeats were due to flaming/feeding adc's who ragequit after the first 10 minutes, eventho the game was perfectly winnable.\r\n\r\nSo dear adc's, please read:\r\n1- your support does not like you\r\n2- if jungler ganks bot, it's not for you to get snowballed. It's to cause the enemy team adc to ragequit. \r\n3- your jungler doest like you\r\n4- mid laners dont like you\r\n5- if top laners teleport bot, its to squash enemy adc's. It's not because they like you.\r\n6- your jungler doesnt really wana give you the red buff.\r\n7- you are never the sole reason a game is won, yet you are always part of the reason a game is lost.\r\n8- your support is not your bitch\r\n9- the support isnt YOUR support, it's the team's support.\r\n10- you have to ward like every fucking one else.\r\n11- chances are, no one in your team really likes you.\r\n12- whenever you lose your lane, you give up like a little bitch. No one in any other lane gives up like that.\r\n\r\n13- if you're part of that 0.1% of adc's that does not flame/afk or intentionally feed, I salute you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy experience with adcarrys through bronze 4 up to platinum 2 (where I am now) has always been the same.

Nobody really likes anyone in soloQ. But allow me to shed some light on why I act the way I do.\n\nFirst and foremost, whoever it is you're playing as this game, you have it easy. Maining an ADC is hard work. You using what are arguably the weakest class of champs in the game for the sole purpose of pushing down towers, and it is next to impossible to get back into the game if you fall at all behind, without piggybacking onto another player's advantages. One wrong move, and you'll find yourself dead in 3 hits with no chance to fight back. But do you know why we main this role, despite all that? Because unlike mid, top, or jungle, there is only room for *one* successful ADC in a game. If your botlane is ineffective, your game is over. We act like we're the lynchpin for the game because we *are.*\n\nWhen you're playing ADC, not only are you suffering the most temperamental role in the game, you are also utterly dependent on another player to win your lane - because of this, you'll also find yourself the victim of League's god-awful communication abilities in a way that is unique to botlane. That's the primary reason for our anger - because we'll see a trick coming, find a moment for a perfect initiation, or realize a fatal flaw in the other team's lineup, and be unable to communicate it in time. There is nothing more frustrating on this Earth.\n\nAnd after all that's said and done, I know that you still only see me as a flaming asshole, but that's because you don't play with me for more than one game. You see me frustrated at the god awful support that was forced into a role which wouldn't exist, were League 4v4. You see me raging at my jungler for not ganking, not because the other jungler has ganked my lane successfully, but because despite how hard he's camping our lane, everyone else is still losing harder, and our own jungler is 0/0/0, 12 minutes into the game. Believe me, if our situations were reversed, you would be just as frustrated.\n\nWhat you *don't* see is the 4-5 times a week I mystery gift my support for landing absolutely incredible plays and helping me win the lane. What you don't see is me successfully captaining a team when I snowball my lane advantage into dragons, midlane and eventually a game win. And what you choose not to remember is when that ADC went 12/1 at the end of laning while the rest of you were 1/5, and he never complained, never expected anything of you but for you to continue playing. And he won you the game.\n\nSo take a step back next time. Consider why the ADC is so mad, and consider what that means for the game as a whole. Recognize that it isn't blind rage, there is a cause, and it's completely out of our control.\n\nConsider, for a moment, that your ADC might actually have a reason for being angry.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEvery ADC ever.","replies":[{"poster":"HellMuff","date":"2014-12-21T00:32:06.200+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Prometheus856,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=86QEeZ4P,comment-id=000b,timestamp=2014-12-20T23:58:52.768+0000)\n> Sincerely,\n> \n> Every ADC ever.\n\n dear misunderstanding teammate:\n\nYour not the only roll that can fall behind, junglers do aswell, as does mid and top. \nYour not the only lane that can get a gank, and ganking bottom lane half the time is useless, due to the fact you NEVER get a pink ward or counter ward what so ever\nAlso, half of you need to learn to last hit only, and how to hold a lane.\nWhen your ready for a gank dosnt mean i am, if im soon going b or have had held on to much gold for to long, im not ganking.\nSure when im ready to gank you and your not ready, dont expect me to hang around and cut into my xp/gold to wait for you to get ready, im gone and off to another lane, maybe youll be ready when i am next time.\n\n\n Because unlike adc, there is only room for one successful jungler in a game.

If I am doing SOOOO terrible for you to comprehend (sometimes I do terribly, I will admit it) AT LEAST HELP ME GET BACK AHEAD!!!\nI hate it when I'm Support too, because I'm blamed for being the sole reason the game was lost. Well EXCUSE ME for not having 100% CDR and infinite mana and 1000 AP at level 1 so that I can heal you 24/7, but I can't.\nI try to give the hint to play a little aggressive and try to get them to leave lane, when I am either ADC or Support, but both times I am with someone who doesn't really move in when I start to move in, not to mention the fact that I end up dying because I went in and I wasn't really thinking rationally, more so just panicked and wanting to get the lead in our lane back.","replies":[]}]}
