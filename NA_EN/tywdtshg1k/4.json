I've been plat1-diamond 5 for a while, and always have held around 60% winrate with nasus in over 500 rank games.\n\n\nNasus is countered not by building damage as some people think, but by building straight up armor. If you pick up someone like shen with free harrass and godly tankiness, nasus cant do shit. He cant 1v1 you because he will run out of mana. \n\nPeople think that nasus is countered by damage. This is not true because post-level 9 he will fuck u up. Build full armor and he wil never kill you.\n\n\n---------TLDR, dont go damage vs nasus. Go full AD and (only) buy MR if the enemy poses a real problem with AP.  Sunfire+ Thornail = he will never kill you.","replies":[]}
