Please try again later.\" It kicks me out of champ select and I then have to close my League, start it back up and hope that I'll load in time before my teammates are allowed to remake. Basically, it hiccups during the initial startup and immediately after restarting it allows me to log into the game just fine. I've looked throughout the forums in hopes of finding a solution but I've failed to do so. I downloaded the Hextech Repair Tool but unfortunately that didn't work. Because of this issue I've lost LP and gained a leaver buster. Please help.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-05T22:48:13.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes those little hiccups can be solved by updating a couple network settings really quickly.
