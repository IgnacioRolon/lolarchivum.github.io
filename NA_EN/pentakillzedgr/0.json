my bad english, im greek\r\n\r\n So i was playing some league and i got in a match against a katarina and i was winning lane from a farm and push perspective but katarina got lvl 6 and started roaming, i pinged bot lane to retreat but they kept pushing and kata got a double, after some minutes of the same thing over and over kata was 7/0 and our botlane was 1/6 and 0/5 so i said in chat \"report bot\" and lucian immediatelly freaked out and started flaming me in greek insulting my religion saying things like Γαμω τον χριστο σου και την οικογενεια σου which translates to i fuck your jesus and your family ( its a rough translation but it makes more sense in greek) so i called him a r%%%%% and got tilted and started being mildly toxic, and sure enough got banned the next few hours and lucian is still not banned.\r\nSecond game we had a delusional tryndamere top with terrible runes,bad items and lost against mordekaiser because it was his first time playing tryndamere,keep in mind that this is ranked anyways so he lost lane,came mid and farmed my lane, died to my enemy mid laner, started blaming me and my premade friend that it was out fault for him losing his lane because we did not go top enough times.\r\nI know my behaviour was not acceptable but i had spent over 200 euros on that account with many skins that are not purchasable that i got from chests, so im just asking for a second chance because i think getting permanently banned for getting tilted from a feeding lucian that insulted my family and religion and a delusional tryndamere that blamed us for his faults and just mildly flaming them is unfair.\r\nOne last thing i have been banned before for 14 days (never got a chat ban though) but that was months ago and i was friendly and polite for months till i just snapped because of this 2 games.\r\nAnyway enough rambling here is my chat log:\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nPentakillZedGR: quick question\r\nPentakillZedGR: was hail of blades

my ban removed(which is the most likely scenario) i will stop playing this game(already made a goodbye post just in case) anyways i hope i get my account back.
