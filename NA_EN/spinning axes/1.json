Last season, I placed Diamond, so I enter games with a diamond border.\n\nWhen I don&#039;t do well in a game, (which I can definitely say I have been playing horrible today,) then I get harassed and ridiculed to no end, with snarky comments like, &quot;which boosting service did you use,&quot; and, &quot;who boosted you to diamond.&quot;\n\nWhile it might seem like fun and games to the person saying it, you&#039;re insulting the time and effort I put into this game and trying to get good at it.\n\nMy diamond border isn&#039;t an indication that I&#039;m some League of Legends god who is immune to feeding his lane opponent.\n\nIf anything, it proves that I&#039;m human - I have goals and hobbies, and as a human, I&#039;ll make mistakes. I&#039;m not perfect like you make me out to be.\n\n\nSo please. Don&#039;t be a dick. I don&#039;t care where you placed, or where I placed. All I care about is the way you&#039;re treating me because of your assumption you make in the 20 minutes that you know me.\n\nI understand that this community is full of toxic asshats who thrive off of other people&#039;s embarrassment and misery. But this is just a heads up to those who are unaware that I really hate being held to standards that I really can&#039;t uphold 24/7.\n\nSincerely,\nSpinning Axes, a simple LoL player.\n\nEDIT: It's really great to hear your guys' support on the issue. I'm trying to read all of the comments, but it's hard to stay caught up!\n\nA question I'd like to ask: Is rank discrimination a reportable offense? I recently answered a comment asking the same question, saying that I think it goes over the scope of gameplay and you're beginning to attack the players morales and goals rather than their gameplay. What do you guys think?\n\nEDIT 2: 100 Upvotes and 2K views! Wow, thanks for the support on the thread. I honestly created this out of frustration and expected to be downvoted because people would think I was a whiny kid.\n\nThank you guys for the support, this is truly a major problem that is overlooked a lot of the time in our community.","replies":[{"poster":"Nyaboron","date":"2016-02-21T05:03:27.820+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":5,"body":"Yeah, I totally get that.

Hell, I've even been accused of rank prejudice for simply posting adversely to a thread and getting a response along the lines of \"You think your opinion is better because you're higher ranked?\" followed by some match history shaming just so the \"You're not even a good Diamond\" card can be pulled too.\n\nAs I've noticed on both the Boards and in game, the vast majority of people that look you up to bring rank/match history/etc. into arguments are low tiers. A low tier will come insisting something extremely silly like that Vel'Koz ADC is the next big thing cuz he's won all his games with it and has soooooo much more experience, but then if you mention your rank (aka experience) into the mix they are instantly triggered and the \"rank shaming\" shaming begins.\n\nI'm pretty triggered now.\n\nThis is the kind of thing you just let go because you know those people are ignorant.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mistikal","date":"2016-02-21T11:01:45.833+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"sounds counter productive, however, I find that if I'm not in a 5 man pre made and in a call. it's better to simply mute everyone and play with pings. keeps me from tilting off other peoples bad attitude when the game is still totally winnable. It actually helps a lot of comebacks. I used to rage like crazy until i started doing this at people raging at other people, but it really is better to simply ignore it and play the game the way you know it should be played. just my opinion though. I know it's definitely helpful to communicate if people are able to be civil. I just don't trust the community to do so anymore sadly. especially at certain times of day when the youngins are out of school acting a fool.","replies":[]},{"poster":"63536895_DEL","date":"2016-02-21T08:45:07.138+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm Silver and I'm Proud","replies":[{"poster":"Myrmiron","date":"2016-02-21T12:15:38.872+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N0yXGVWS1Y","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DeadMansWill","date":"2016-02-21T17:29:13.462+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Okay so here's the thing : \n\nAm I saying people are justified for behaving in this fashion?
