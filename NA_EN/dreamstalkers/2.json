I hear this all the time, and I usually think it&#039;s over exaggerating because I agree that some games are one-sided, but I&#039;ve always still had some great games that get down to the wire and were decided based on a good pick, or someone mechanically outplaying in a big fight, or some decision making with a quick baron call, etc..  but I have literally been recording the past 15 games I&#039;ve played (on another account, gold 2 rated) and 15 out of 15 games were one-sided, win or lose. EVERY GAME!!!\r\n\r\nI really try to look at the bright side of most situations in my life, but I just can&#039;t find these games fun anymore.  One thing that I&#039;ve always enjoyed about this game, is that _laning phase doesn&#039;t decide the game._  You always know in the back of your mind, that later on in teamfights or from good calls, you have a chance to come back, which gives you the drive and motivation to keep your head up and keep playing, and having that drive turns losing games into games that are still fun and enjoyable (most of the time they are even more fun than just stomping your opponent from the 5 min mark)\r\n\r\nWhy would Riot ever think this is a better approach to a game like this? Like I said I&#039;ve played 15 games in a row and recorded how they all went, just so I had something to support my argument.  14 out of the 15 games, the team who got the first 2 turrets, won the game.  The one game where this didn&#039;t happen, my team got our 2nd tower about 1 minute after they got their 2nd, and after we got our 2nd tower, the snowball began. Maybe I have the worst luck in history, cause 15 games really is a lot of games in league.. but judging by the posts, I&#039;m not alone on this feeling.\r\n\r\nThe thing that drew me to this game was the huge fights that would actually end with 1 or 2 people alive, and the unpredictable outcomes of each game.  I&#039;m really depressed that the game has turned into a snowball fest every single game, and there&#039;s no mystery anymore.  I&#039;ve even noticed more annoyed angry players who give up because frankly when you lost your inhib at 14 minutes, what can you really do? Defend your base while they go grab the rift/baron and they 5 man another lane against your 4 people (while one is still defending the missing inhib lane).. it&#039;s sad.  This approach might work better for other games, but League of Legends needs to be a longer game, it only makes sense on how it was designed (there&#039;s champs that are only supposed to be good past 30 minutes!!) \r\n\r\nAnyway, I would love to hear everyone&#039;s opinions on this issue. Do you like the shorter games? Are you still having great games? Please let me know!\r\n\r\nTL:DR- After recording 15 games, every single game was one-sided. This is very unenjoyable for a game like League, considering some champs and items are meant to be good after 25-30 minutes of the game. Also it feels like laning phase decides the game, and that is one thing I&#039;ve always been afraid of happening. The mystery and excitement is gone , or is barely there.. and since the beginning of season 7, it just seems to get worse and worse.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ok sure but why","date":"2017-11-15T23:41:34.990+0000","up_votes":64,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is the only reason I hate playing against a Pantheon. \n\nEveryone's like, \"Oh no, he falls off in the late game!!!\"\n\n*What late game?*\n\nAnd when Riot makes continuous changes to the game [like buffing Vayne's Q damage for the early game and removing its ability to crit for the late game, giving most bruisers/tanks/mages a decently high amount of base damage with less substantial amount of scaling damage, first tower gold, Rift Herald, the removal of everything crit-related from the new runes, removing critical damage from most assassins who once liked it (Talon, Rengar, etc.) etc.], it shows us just how much they want the early game to mean everything.\n\nI guess they just want LCS matches to have all their Oompth early on so people don't get bored.

To all my boards brethren who live in low elo, pick Tristana or Xayah ADC, with Leona support. You will need a premade for this, most likely. \n\n Both of you take Press the Attack, poke them to at least 75% or lower as the ADC, because you want to make sure they aren't walking away from this.\n\n And as long as you are clever with your timing, the enemy jungler isn't ramming himself up your ass, and your Leona hits her UMBRELLA OF JUSTICE, then it's a guaranteed kill early. Just be sure to not underestimate the support, because most likely you'll be low enough for even a Soraka or Janna to finish you off post-kill. Assuming you went for the ADC first, that is.\n\nMake sure that BOTH OF YOU proc Press the Attack, that's 12% more damage of \"vulnerability\" per person. 24% extra damage, 2 stuns (or 3 if you pick Xayah), and a competent duo and BANG you're ahead. Good luck to the enemy team, because you're GETTING that 6~ minute tower for sure, and if you play like a lil pussi bitch and dont die a lot, you can carry most likely.","replies":[{"poster":"W1nter Wind","date":"2017-11-17T06:21:32.051+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"wait, is pta stack for every member?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Chill Vibez","date":"2017-11-15T23:46:30.056+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":3,"body":"yea it sucks now.... how can u have fun wit a game when as soon as you're getting into it, the other team wins?? \n\nI really don't see any way at all to enjoy it anymore","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2017-11-16T04:58:14.340+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hell, being the winner isn't that much fun either when it feels like you didn't do much to earn it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"2Charmnot2Charm","date":"2017-11-17T00:38:22.160+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"After the stupid ardent meta i'm perfectly fine with this snowball meta right now.\n\nPlaying support is actually fun again.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fedoran","date":"2017-11-16T04:34:35.387+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":1,"body":"The games aren't one sided silly!
