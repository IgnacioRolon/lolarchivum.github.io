So you do end up with some silver level players grouped with a rare plat or two, because the silver is the tryhard and the plat has a lower MMR because he always plays normals drunk.  And even that is rare.  Most of the time, for example, I see Golds and a few Silvers in my normals.  Every great once in a while, I see a Diamond, and it is almost always because of a duo queue on one team messing up the MMR massively.\n\nIt never happens in ranked.  Period.  It can't actually happen in ranked anymore, unless the higher MMR player is on a low MMR smurf, but we do not have any kind of accurate data on that.
