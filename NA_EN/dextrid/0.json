Dont you bored  of playing  versus or with yasuo ? It is time to  do somethink about it and it means NERF. \r\n\r\n1.  After ulti 50 percent armor penetration:  like for real ?  thats too much \r\n2. Two passives : delete one of them every champ has one ...maybe shield \r\n3. Too much movement speed:  he can dash so he dont need that much \r\n4. The final its just speculation give him mana instead of flow \r\n\r\nAfter this  i dont think that yas will be  played that often\r\nyours,\r\nULTIMATE YASUO HATER \r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ruin Lance","date":"2018-02-24T23:55:39.337+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://i.imgur.com/LVR3dz9.png\n\nyasuo is op","replies":[{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2018-02-25T00:01:35.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so op i stopped banning camille to ban yasuo from my teammates xd /s.","replies":[{"poster":"BDE Moonpíe","date":"2018-03-01T19:35:50.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"47% winrate. have you seen Sion, Kled, and Olaf, there are so many better picks than Yasuo","replies":[{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2018-03-08T00:07:24.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's sarcasm","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Purgë","date":"2018-02-25T01:00:33.949+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"i agree with everything u said , the downvotes are from the  salty yasou mains","replies":[{"poster":"BDE Moonpíe","date":"2018-03-01T19:36:50.811+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"I'm a Yasuo main and I can tell you the only thing that is keeping Yasuo alive right now is Fleet Footwork.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CaliCoastReplay","date":"2018-02-24T23:16:17.729+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The only thing that genuinely bothers me about Yasuo is that every minion wave represents 6 to 7 free dashes that also damage opponents.

It's called champion click.\n\nAlso, yas has meh MR and does shit for damage without items. Since he builds AD items his items are more expensive than yours, and he can't e through his own minions so he has shit for escapes. He's also super weak to CC and single target abilities.\n\nJust play orianna or syndra or lissandra. All 3 just wreck his ass.

It's aggravating when you try and hit him - wind wall, you try and hit him - shield, you try and hit him - dash over and over again.  It seems like an issue when he can be played on every lane effectively.  \n\nHis counter play is literally just trying to not be killed by him in lane.  There is almost no one that can out trade him.  \n\nHeck, Yasuo's win condition is making an early kill in lane.  If he doesn't make his kill, he's useless.  He sucks playing against and he sucks having him on your team.","replies":[{"poster":"TitanAnteus","date":"2018-03-01T12:43:13.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have no clue what the complaint about windwall is man. He's a melee champ, and his windwall is at 20 sec cooldown rank 1 and it's the last ability he maxes.\n\nIf you can't hit him because of his E, that means he's outplaying you. You're a worse player than him. I can beat him as lux for god's sake. You're ranged, he's not. He can only dash on enemy minions.","replies":[{"poster":"Kirika","date":"2018-08-04T22:49:08.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually the 20 secs is pretty sick if you look at what it does. He can literally block a Lux Q that already hit him. And with a Q CD of 9 secs on Lux Q early you have exactly one Q time to hit. That is if you can get a clean shot in the time and even then you wont be able to deal much dmg cause of his shield. \nThe windwall is even more an issue if you think about all the stuff it blcks, that isnt even A projectile. For example skills tha move under the earth or comve from above. Even some champions that fly in his direction are considered \"Projektiles\". \nBut away from the windwall: i think his passive is just overloaded. A level scaling shield AND Double krit? Lets compare that to other passives and we will see that its a whole lot stronger than needed. Shyvana for example. Her passive was even nerfed. She gets more dmg to drake, wich is okay and hey...5 MR and Armor per Drake, starting with 5: The passive is completely reliant on how well your team does and even the its kinda crappy.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CaliCoastReplay","date":"2018-02-25T00:51:10.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TitanAnteus,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2KJcITn3,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2018-02-25T00:39:09.180+0000)\n>\n> If you hold tilda and click near the enemy champion it clicks on the champions ignoring all minions.

I can do quite well against him on my best champions, and of course he rarely sees play at the highest levels.\n\nIt just seems sometimes like a no-mana ability that has almost no effective cooldown and uses *enemy minions* as an effective resource is unbalancing.  Enemy minion waves almost empower him, which is the opposite of most champions.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Who Fed Ru","date":"2018-02-25T01:01:00.764+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"nah nerf {{champion:86}} gg","replies":[{"poster":"BDE Moonpíe","date":"2018-03-01T19:34:05.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i mean, this man is not wrong, lethality Garen is so good","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pheobos","date":"2018-02-24T23:41:28.730+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"I agree on yasuo being too strong, but i would nerf him diffrently. \nMake it so his dashes and his windwall cost him flow. Doesn't have to be much, but it would mean his skill floor would increase. It would get players to think about how to use their abillities more, do they dash through waves to poke, but sacrifysing their shield for it? Or farm safely with shield at the ready?\n\nOtherwise I'd like a change to his crit passive.\nI'd love to see it being moved to his ult and see it ramp up with levels in his ultimate. \n(eighter that or change it so it ramps up with level so his early wouldn't be so strong with just 1 crit item)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Misevi","date":"2018-02-24T22:48:47.504+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ugh nerf him to hell so I don't see them Yasuos feeding in my games","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zyreptix","date":"2018-10-09T21:30:36.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasou deserves to get nerfed to the ground","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrueChouxxxWiii","date":"2018-05-06T13:36:47.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People who wants him nerf are people who just can't counter him right...
