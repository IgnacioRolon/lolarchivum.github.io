Cho&#039;gath is always good in early game, mid game and especially late game and his ult does tons of damage, it doesn&#039;t matter if he builds ap or tank. I don&#039;t see a better tank to pick in games other than cho&#039;gath, he has the damage, the cc and the tank, which is why I think he should be changed in some way so that he doesn&#039;t dominate too much.","replies":[{"poster":"NotDevan","date":"2015-04-10T22:10:17.366+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Are you sure you're playing League?","replies":[{"poster":"Free Wukong","date":"2015-04-10T22:37:15.374+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"And I'm getting this comment why?
