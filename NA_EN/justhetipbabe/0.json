If the patching process messed up there could be some corrupted game files that are causing these crashes. \n\nLet's go over the [**Bug Splat Guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974) to see if we can narrow down what's been causing these crashes.","replies":[{"poster":"justhetipbabe","date":"2017-04-04T17:54:06.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i did all that i even reinstalled my windows and got a new ssd drive. i reinstalled the game 4 times and it still happens. i just got kicked mid game and it woudnt let me reconnect to the game but it allowed me to que up for a new game while i was already in a mid game. what the hell is going on.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-06T21:08:56.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow....that is hella weird o_o.
