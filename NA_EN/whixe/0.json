It's important to be super careful with the action you are taking and confirming for a shard, because it's not something we currently provide refunds for.  Still, 213 orange essences are a good amount and I hope you can unlock some really cool stuff with it!","replies":[{"poster":"WhixE","date":"2016-08-25T11:16:31.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh! sorry, it was my fault that i didnt see carefully. i wanted that skin, really cant help me with that?","replies":[]}]}]}
