I play lots of top lane and use a lot of the champions that dwell there, but recently its been getting a bit stale and need a new champion to spice things up a bit{{champion:92}} . I just feel that I need to try new things and adapt to my &quot;main lane&quot; as much as possible if anyone can relate. I don&#039;t always top if that is what your thinking. I will occasionally fill the jungle roll {{champion:32}} or play the hardship of the bot lane{{champion:42}} , but top lane is my home and my goal is to learn each champ to their full potential. Let me know what you feel is best in the comments and I will try to respond A.S.A.P.","replies":[{"poster":"CR4ZYRONDH4VI","date":"2016-08-04T20:16:20.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All depends on the match up.
