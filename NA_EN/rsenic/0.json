I played a little bit of ranked around season 5 and 6 but it gradually wore off on me over the years and by the time I reached college, I was mainly queuing up norms for fun with my floor-mates. I have never really played competitively nor do I really care for the ranked system Riot presents. This morning, I woke up to 5(??) emails from Riot telling me that my account has been permabanned for malicious third-party software. This struck me quite funny as: (A) I don't care enough about the competitive system enough to dedicate my time and energy towards such efforts. (B) I am honestly pretty clueless about technology; ask me about Bio and Chem and especially Physics and I will gladly begin a conversation, but turn that to computers and programming and it's essentially a different language to me. I have no clue how difficult said third-party softwares are to download and run because I've never given it much thought, but either way I doubt I would be able to operate such a program. For a while, I had no clue as to what Riot was referring to as the closest thing I had used ever that may bear resemblance to a third-party software is Scarra's TFT cheatsheet. \n\nI just logged into my account tonight to see if there have been any updates to the ticket I submitted to Riot, and took a cursory glance at my match history only to find 3 ranked games played on my account on Tuesday 7/2. I spent all of yesterday (today is 7/3) driving up to San Francisco to meet my parents and did not touch League at all, much less play 3 ranked games. I have read Riot's policy on permabanned accounts even if the actions were of no fault to the account owner themself. As a quick summary, it essentially states that whatever happens on your account is your responsibility and you are solely accountable for anything that takes place on your account. I understand from a company standpoint that this kind of a policy is necessary so offenders of the Summoner's Code cannot attribute their actions to someone else. However, as a middle school kid who used to spend his allowance on a couple precious skins back in the day, I find it extremely frustrating to lose my account and the monetary value it also represents, all based off something I didn't even know about!!!!! This is not even mentioning the time that I put into my account back in the days when League was part of my teenage rebellion phase and I woke up in the middle of the night just for a couple more games, all the way to my college days. I am writing this to the community because although League is no longer a big part of my life, I still wish to maintain my access to the game along with all the accolades I achieved along the way. I understand that Riot has their policies and they will probably stick by it, but I am hoping to bring this into light with the community to create some friction and hopefully have Rioters take another look at this case. Please do let me know if you guys have any thoughts or opinions, and if ya'll want to know any additional information, let me know and I will do my best to supply your demands.\n\nUpdate: \n\nRiot Support team responded today with the following message: \n\nHey there!\n\nI know how frustrating it is that you feel that your account is not supposed to be banned.\n\nWe have evidence suggesting your account is deemed to be banned. I’m sorry but there’s nothing that can be done for this account.\n\nFor the security of our future investigations, I cannot share any details of the results of your account review. We hope you understand.\n\nIf you need anything else, just ask.\n\nOneHitDeleteADC\nRiot Games Player Support\n\nWhile my particular situation may not be all that common, I am sure it still happens once in a while. When it does, it feel extremely unsatisfying to lost an account when I don't even know what actually happened. This feeling gets worse when it doesn't even seem like Riot Support is trying to do anything about it. Like, I get that most of the time they do catch the perpetrators and Yay they did their job, but just like anything else there's always a margin of error. I find it hard to believe there is absolutely no way to determine if my account was hacked, or that they have no better explanation than \"I cannot share any details.\" \n\nJust another thing I was thinking about, the only thing different about my account were the 3 games that I found in my match history. Just based off of 3 games, Riot permabans my account? I'm not completely sure if this is standard procedure for them but it seems a bit drastic to me. \n\nOnce again, I'd love to hear your guys thoughts on this or if you have any advice. Thanks!

I feel like they'll reply back telling me that just because the IP location was different, doesn't prove that I had nothing to do with it. I could have \"paid\" someone to play ranked for me (which is just dumb because I haven't played ranked in about 2 years). Idk man, will definitely bring that up.

For example, someone allows a friend or family member to try out LoL on their account, and the new player - facing opponents matched to the actual account holder, not a new player - gets such a poor score that they're flagged as inting. Riot doesn't want to have to deal with \"but it wasn't me, it was someone else who pretended to be me\" with no way for Riot to tell whether the player is being truthful. For another example, someone who's played for years decides to give their account to a booster, who then uses scripts. Riot doesn't want to have to deal with \"but I didn't start using scripts, it was some hacker, no fault of mine\" with no way for Riot to tell whether the player is being truthful.","replies":[{"poster":"RseNic","date":"2019-07-04T05:46:32.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Exactly why I am not very optimistic about Riot reverting their decision.
