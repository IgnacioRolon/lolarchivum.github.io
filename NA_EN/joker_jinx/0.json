Women and men often attend things together and I don&#039;t know a woman on the planet who would ever alienate someone she holds close like that by leaving them outside the panel. They didn&#039;t just alienate men, they also basically alienated women too to some degree.\n\nWe didn&#039;t ask for this special treatment, nor are we weak and need protection. Honestly, Riot&#039;s just having a laugh at our expense at this point.\n\nThis isn't about what time men were allowed either. This is about riot's sexual harassment being exposed at the workplace, and the employees who did it still work there, and now riot feels the need to condescendingly cater to women as special snowflakes, demeaning us and making us look like we need that special treatment because in no other situation would we be able to succeed in the workplace except to exclude men. Because men are that threatening. We complain about sexual harassment, and this condescending display is what we get for opening up.\n\nEquality will never exist at this point.","replies":[]}
