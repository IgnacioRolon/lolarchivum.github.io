I am in agreement with the franchising module. I think if Riot were to allow each team to have a permanent spot in the LCS, there is potential for there to be more than  10 teams in the future. However as fans we want even the lower tier matches to have an incentive to win and right now that incentive is to not get demoted. Riot needs to find another incentive for lower tier teams to still try there best to win, which could be cash prizes based on team standings. \r\n\r\nNow with the Scouting Grounds in place for NA, I think Riot could turn this into a draft style combine. For 1 week players attending the Scouting Grounds will be able to show off their skills and game knowledge. There is no certainty that these players will be signed, however if a draft is in place, each LCS team will get 1 draft pick, the lowest ranked team with the highest draft pick and the highest ranked team will get the lowest draft pick. In league of legends there are 2 splits however for this draft it can occur before the new season begins however it is based on both the spring and summer split. Therefore the draft will be based on the worst rated team throughout the year. \r\n\r\nNow after the players have been drafted into their respective teams, they may not get playing time on the lcs team. With this problem, the best answer is for every lcs team have a minor league team. This will change the Challenger Series forever. Right now the Challenger Series is in a huge mess, no sponsors, no certainty to make it into the lcs. If we change the Challenger Series into a minor league, then teams will get sponsors from their pro team, fans will be more inclined to watch because theses are the potential players for the pro team and the minor league players will have a chance to get a spot on a pro team if the player; retires, become a free agent or the pro player has been under performing. \r\n\r\nI personally believe this is the best way to help team owners, pro players, challenger ladder players, sponsors and Riot themselves.\r\nComment on your thoughts too!","replies":[{"poster":"YambrinZ","date":"2016-11-17T00:33:34.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not as easy as many would make it out to be.

Let's say each team has their own \"aaa-league team\", what's to stop them from drafting players/releasing them and replacing them with lcs-level talent a la the whole \"c9c\" thing from last split? While the scouting grounds does introduce lcs teams to fresher talent on a wider basis, it doesn't actually solve the fact that (for korea/NA at least) there's tons of lcs-ready free agents out there who look far more appetizing to teams. EU is the only region that is really going to \"benefit\" off this idea, as the sheer dearth of talent they have there is sorta making me think that we could see them become the esports equivalent of the AFC South in the NFL (in which all the teams look incredibly bad compared to other parts and realistically have zero shot of winning a championship).\n\nOh, and owners will probably hate the idea as well. They already lose $ fielding their current teams as it is, being forced to field another will almost certainly make them throw punches.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pippen The Short","date":"2016-12-01T18:51:03.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A \"minor league\" system is definitely needed for the LCS to actually become more stable, not only in talent but in turnover and competition as well.\n\n\n\n\nThat being said, I don't see how it's not possible to create a system that both creates franchises but still employs relegation somehow. Because you could have temporary franchise opportunities (3 or 5 year deals) instead of the consistent permanent franchise positions. Or, much like what you're suggesting, with an established minor league system franchises could be permanent but still be relegated from the LCS to the CS. But expand the CS to a 2 tier Minor League (Masters and Challenger tiers). Then offer up 32 or even 48 permanent franchises but then between the LCS and 2 tier minor league system have 64 spots available (16 LCS, 16 CS, 32 MS).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ale non Ã¨ male","date":"2016-11-16T21:42:24.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not in EU.
