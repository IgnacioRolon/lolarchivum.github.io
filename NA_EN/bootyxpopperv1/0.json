But today, October 9,2016 (1:10 a.m Eastern Time) i was going to play a game with my friend and we knew that we had to wait for my 20 minutes. After the 20 minutes were done we were put into select champions but for some reason my friend select champion wasn't loading. I was actually in the phone with them at that time and she was saying it was pitch black and nothing was popping up unlike me i was already in champ select but in her box for her character she had a blue box with a lighting looking symbol saying game aint going to start until she loads. At last she didnt load so she was given a penalty time of 5 minutes of wait time when her game didnt load her up to select a champ. We didnt worried so much about the 5 minutes though. But after the 5 minutes of wait we were put again in my 20 minutes of leaverbuster. We waited those 20 Minutes and after it hit 00:00 the timer reset again started again at 20 minutes. We both couldn't understand why we had to wait another extra 20 minutes after it was done If you could please explain or somehow fixed that BUG if it is one you guys would ROCK. Thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-09T22:29:17.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It sounds like both you and your friend may be experiencing a poor connection to the servers.
