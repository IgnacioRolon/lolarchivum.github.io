However, after a relog the rune page is gone again and I am left with just the presets.\n\nI added more and more rune pages since the start of runes reforged and was playing with 18/18 several days. They disappeared yesterday and it all (the error) started.\n\n**Edit (Posts merged)**\n**#1: **\nAdditionally, I am also unable to go into my emote menu. It gives me the following error.\n\n> \"Sorry! Something went wrong with your emote wheel. Please try again later, or \n> contact player support if the problem persists. Error code: EM01\"\n\n\nMaybe it is also of help: I realize the errors started happening shortly after I opened the level 40 loot capsule from which the level 40 emote is automatically placed into your emote wheel.\n\n**#2:**\nNew info: I tried solving the issue with the DNS / IP solutions via the troubleshooting page. No change. It still won't save my rune reforged pages and after I applied the DNS solution the emote wheel menu now additionally gives me the error code EM05 to my previous error EM01.\n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"PibeMinisteren","date":"2017-12-26T20:18:15.926+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same shit here........................","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Iecerint","date":"2018-04-08T21:22:41.329+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Sparkle,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=GiRfERpj,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-12-26T16:59:07.983+0000)\n>\n> Sounds like you're not connecting properly to something. :/ \n> \n> - Is your internet connection strong and stable? \n> - Can you change &amp; save settings?\n> \n> EDIT: How long did you have your custom pages before they disappeared?\n\nI have this problem, too.

It boggles me that it was never addressed except for this thread. And the response isn't really that helpful neither. It's my first month in League and I'm not fast enough to set up runes on the fly when the match starts so I wish to keep two for my current mains.\n\nEvery time I relog, the runes are gone, and I have to set them up again before the game starts. It's frustrating.\n\nI don't know if that's related, but another thing which happens(which is kind of similar issue) is \"Disable Login Animations\" is always unchecked when I open up the launcher. \n\nAre the rune and login animation configs stored locally? If so, where? It is possible that I have something related to admin permissions or read only in there. Or maybe it's trying to access something what doesn't exist.\n\nThank you for understanding and sorry for the bump. I explained why I bumped on the first paragraph.\n\nEdit: The issue was fixed after a patch it seems.
