Everytime your character attacks an enemy with the right-click action it deals damage based on *base AD* which it has indipendently from items plus *bonus AD* which comes out of items but also some spell effects or abilities, then that damage gets multiplied by many other factors that i am not going to discuss here ( like armor). Some spells deal increased damage with more AD, for example most assassins or marksmans have at least one or two.\n\nAP increases the effect of spells only. The difference in practice between AD and AP is that AP has a broader use and scales better on spells compared to AD. AP can increase damage done by a spell, but it can also increase healing and the power of shields and such. There are also many passives into the game that allow basic attacks to deal additional damage based on AP.\n\nEvery spell scales differently with AD and AP, so you better refer to the champion page to see the details. You can have an idea of how a spell scales looking at the tooltip: if a number is red-dark orange then it scales on AD, if it is blue-greenish then it scales on AP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-31T01:07:26.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AD stands for \"Attack Damage\" which is basically like physical damage. \nAP stands for \"Ability Power\" which is most like spells or magical oriented damage.","replies":[]}]}
