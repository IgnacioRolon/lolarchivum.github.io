I fixed it and checked the LoL patcher. It said that was scanning for step 2. I checked again later, I find not only has the download speed fallen but it`s still showing the scanning thing with no files scanned. It`s still downloading but the speed has fallen. What should I do? I also don't want to restart the download because it took me 4 days to reach 50 %.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-11-09T19:24:30.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey MugetsuR, \n\nFirst and foremost, good god that is a very long time o.o Dedicated player over here ^^^^ Any who I think I may have the prescription your patcher may need, just make sure to follow all the steps. \n\nPatcher KB: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues\n\nHope this works out for you, and if you still need help reach out on here :) \n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}}","replies":[{"poster":"MugetsuR","date":"2015-11-10T05:03:11.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks alot!
