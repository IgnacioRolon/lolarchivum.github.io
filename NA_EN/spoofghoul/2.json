At the moment, it takes 10 auto-attacks to get full benefit from the keystone as an ADC, which is quite a lot of ramp-up time - and usually, by the time the ADC got 10 autos off (5 seconds into the fight at least), the fight is already decided.\nWarlord's gives Lifesteal, plain and simple. This is extremely interesting for an ADC, as it allows one to forego buying a Vampiric Sceptre (and sinking 900 gold and an item slot into it) till very late in the game, and concentrate all your money towards reaching that crucial two item spike.\n\nPersonally, I think that 10 stacks for Fervor and it not stacking on abilities is restricting the mastery too much.
