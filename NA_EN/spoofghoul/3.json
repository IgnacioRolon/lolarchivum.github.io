You say \"Riot is a business, therefore, they will always prioritize what makes more money (or, in this case, prioritize what loses them the least amount of money in the long run).\" Just because there's a business doesn't mean that Riot as an entity is a hive mind of corporate robots. There are some people that genuinely want this game to be great.\n\nIf they only cared about money, why would they give you the chance to earn free shit with hextech crafting? Why would they bother to reduce the prices of champions every once in a while?\n\nAnyway, that's a bit beside the point, but I'm tired of people saying that Riot is this big, reptilian entity that only cares about money.\n\nOnward, then...\n\nWhat Riot wanted to do with dynamic queue is essentially create a team builder that people would actually use. In a perfect world, the community would play both a solo and dynamic queue out of preference in pretty substantial numbers. However, this is not a perfect world and there are many outside factors that contributed to the failure of team builder in the first place. People say team builder doesn't matter, not enough people played it so the queue times were abysmal, thus circularly killing off any audience it had in the first place. More people quit because of the terrible queue times, and thus the queue times get worse.\n\nA lot of people feel like dynamic queue and solo queue can exist at the same time, but I highly doubt that that is the case. Solo queue is highly competitive, and may draw more of the hard core players that don't like to support, alleviating the queue times in dynamic queue, but realistically you know this community will shame anyone who wants to play dynamic queue, because it's \"not a true ranked ladder experience\" or it's \"for people to get boosted by their friends.\"\n\nThe social pull of the community is not to be underestimated. Solo queue will probably just overtake this mode if it's released again. Is that a bad thing? Not necessarily, but I for one like this type of mode and would hate to see it go... that is, if it had it's issues straightened out. Sure I have some issues with it, but they're pretty minor and can probably be sorted out.

Electronic Arts and Ubisoft get away with shit like microtransactions to help you win in the middle of a game (purchasing ammo with cash) or they could just keep all champions at 6300 ip, so it takes fucking forever to get any champion at all without grinding the equivalent of a human lung's black market value, or just shelling out to actually get something useful.
