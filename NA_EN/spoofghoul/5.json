His kit allows him to engage, disengage, peal, save allies, poke in lane, stop dashes and shield an ally.\nIf he gets a buff, even indirectly, it would cause balance issues.\nSimilar to lee sin which again is supposed to be high skill cap hero. He is so overloaded that for a very high skill cap, he has 50% win rate or higher while being in the top 5 most popular heroes in the game.\nEkko has more utility than utility supports in terms of how many things it can do, while also having higher damage output.\n\nPersonally I think Camille looks very cool and interesting to play. But they overloaded her with types of damage. Even if not a lot, it would be a nightmare to balance. Her Q does true damage on second strike, her W does %map hp damage, her R allows her to do magic damage, and her normal attacks do physical damage.\nSame reason if fiora gets a slight buff, she goes bad shit crazy as she deals a lot of true damage, combined with high mobility.","replies":[{"poster":"Spaceman5pff","date":"2016-11-26T18:42:15.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't think of any clearer way to explain my point, so I am sorry you do not understand what it is I am trying to say.","replies":[{"poster":"Serika Zero","date":"2016-11-26T22:31:21.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'm getting it.\nyou think overloading is fine unless there's a huge mix of offense and defense\n\nwhile I'm against a character having 99 options and abilities, except a bitch, that ain't one.\nLike seriously, she can:\nDo true damage\nDo Magic damage\nDo AD damage\nDo %max hp damage\nSlow.\nStun in aoe.\nMobility to move around.\nIncreased attack speed.\nShield.\nHeal.\nIncrease moving speed.\nKnock back targets.\nLock targets into a zone.\nWave push.\nUntargetability.\n\nShe is only missing \"ranged attacks\".

ANY Champion can, she is actually quite weak at it. She has her W, and is AD, naturally building into Tiamat. Renekton as you gave as an example has his Q for wave push which is pretty much the same as Camille's wave push ability. Except rene maxes his first.\nA champion with no wave push: Original Fiora. Which is why she HAD to buy tiamat and hydra every game.\n\nShe still does magic damage, even if its a little, it will cause balancing problems in the future. Take Ezreal for example, his Q only did a little extra thing, applying spell effects.............. runegleive happened and Ezreal was fucking broken.\n\nMobility restricted by walls, when the entire map is formed by walls. Its also a 2 way mobility, allowing her to go over distance very few heroes can. If anything, her mobility is great. Same tier as Tristana or Zed.\nNot Fiora, Lee Sin, Yasuo tier. But still very good.\n\nHer heal is still a heal. Its there as a \"patch\". Riot will argue it being there as a way to limit her \"power budged\".
