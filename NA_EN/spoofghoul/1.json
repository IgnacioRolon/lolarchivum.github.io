Before, he would get what? 20 AD (66 base AD * 0.3) + 6 (10% ratio) AP = 26? (I'm excluding the 10 bonus magic damage from all my calculations, and only focusing on what has changed: base AD damage, ad ratios and ap ratios).\n\nSo it's somewhat irrelevant if new voidlings will get _slightly_ more damage for AD builds, when they will get _significantly_ more damage for AP builds.\n\nP.S. You should put that tooltip somewhere else, because it's one of most important mechanics that any new Malz player needs to learn.","replies":[{"poster":"PermabannedGaren","date":"2016-11-18T03:03:16.632+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Skyroar,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AlrKTtQA,comment-id=00030001,timestamp=2016-11-18T02:48:39.335+0000)\n>\n> The problem is that a lot of it relies on base skill damage, which AP builds also benefit from.\n> \n> A Malz with Needlessly Large Rod will get 30 + 12 = 42 from new changes, which is quite close to the AD numbers, WHILE getting an incredible boost to all his other skills.

This is going to bring back some things I loved about Malz, concerning split pushing, and taking towers. He's maintaining his image that Rito likes with AP, and a damage over time killer to any champ tank or adc. In case Rito is reading this, I just wanna say that I fell in love with Malz cuz of his assassin feel, so any more buffs to his AP so I can have this feel back would be greatly appreciated. #KeepBuffingApMalz","replies":[]}]}
