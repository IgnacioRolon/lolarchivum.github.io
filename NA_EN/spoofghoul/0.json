That guy better be **really good** at killing Ashe, else he's going to be useless. Given how safe Ashe tends to be (especially when she has a Janna on her team) it's likely Talon is going to need some mechanics that result in him one-shotting her before she can respond. \n\nTalon is viable, but Ashe has a bad time.\n\nNow imagine that Talon had mechanics in his kit that allowed him to have some degree of success vs. champions who aren't Ashe.  In this case Talon can be **less good** at killing Ashe because he can contribute to the team in other ways.  Wooo, Joe's success case is now less binary and Ashe doesn't get one-shot as much.\n\n% health damage is one such mechanic.  It can allow a character who might normally be very focused on murdering squishies to have success cases against tanks, which means we can make their overall effectiveness against said squishies lower and possibly less frustrating.\n\nOf course there's tradeoffs here.  % health damage isn't always a good idea or the right thing to do, given the champion we're putting it on.  Gains in one area often come with costs in another.  Tank Ekko and Fizz showed us the dark side of more target agnostic assassins for example.\n\n------------------------------\nSide note: Tanks  can still respond to % health damage by buliding Armor/MR.

I would argue that the unhealthy side effect is that it makes tanks less relevant. Hear me out. Tanks can respond to %HP damage with resistances in most cases, but it still means that they can't survive against such target agnostic enemies (because you've traded off ADC quality of life in exchange for the tanks who can now be viably focused). Given that tanks can't really tank as much you need to give them something to be relevant and many have been given damage. Some through their kits in giving them %HP damage of their own, some through itemization like DMP, some through keystone masteries, etc.... Now tanks are doing more damage without being able to effectively tank while adcs are taking less damage without doing less damage while neither need to build damage or defenses respectively to do so. \n\nTo a lot of people this looks dangerously like damage creep and/or champion homogenization. \n\nIt also feels pretty bad to die so quickly when you're building nothing but tank items.

So you can get murdered even though you play around it perfectly by dodging every skill shot because your teammates were bad. Then there's Black Cleaver, Vi's Denting Blows, and Darius's Apprehend.

This is why %health true damage has always been so contentious. \n\nUnfortunately, that's barely true.  If someone gains 10% effective health against physical damage, they can do it either by gaining health or armour:\n2000 hp -> 2200 hp\nOR\n100 armour -> 120 armour\n\nSo we can do the math on 20% max hp damage:\nIn the 2000 hp, 120 armour case, it's 400 damage, reduced to 400*(100/220)=182, or 9.1% of the target's max health.\nIn the 2200 hp, 100 armour case, it's 440 damage, reduced to 440*(100/200)=220, or 10% of the target's max health.\n\nSo for a given amount of effective physical health, each point of armour increases effective health by 0.5% against physical percent health damage.  What this means is that armour, while effective, gives less of a bonus than building health against normal damage.
