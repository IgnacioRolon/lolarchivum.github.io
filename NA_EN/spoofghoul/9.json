After combustion is fully charged champion lights up for 0.5 seconds before actually unleashing the combustion during those 0.5 seconds and for 0.5 seconds after no additional combustion charges can be gained\r\n\r\n**Why these changes,** \r\nWell most tanks have decent hp regen so they can make use of that for better sustain, armor is down health slightly up. More general defense partly in hp and mostly in sustain to have the option to stick around a bit longer or regen up a little after a trade.\r\nThe drop in armor will hurt overall bulk but that is the trade off for the damage you buy\r\n\r\nThe damage has gone up compared to pre 7.9 sunfire, but only if the combustion part gets activated. but it now has clear counter play and is telegraphed.\r\nCounter play consists of proccing the combustion when the tank isn&#039;t close as well as moving away from him when you see the aura brighten telling you the tank is close to combustion. or when he lights up you have 0.5 to prepare to avoid getting hit, and even if you do the damage is about 40-125 depending on level so that still isnt to big of a deal if you only get hit once","replies":[{"poster":"BDE MoonpÃ­e","date":"2017-05-07T13:41:47.499+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, this is a really good idea, sunfires is not in the fight place in my opinion as well, this would be a really good way to get this item back into the fray.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-05-08T12:36:27.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My only concern with connecting it to champion size is how it might effect tanks like Poppy or Amumu.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Asayake 5150glow","date":"2017-05-07T14:35:20.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Should be no extra range for combustion, especially since the range is already getting buffed with no longer starting from the middle.
