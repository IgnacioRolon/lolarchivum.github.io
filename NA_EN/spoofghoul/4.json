Everyone wants to kill the tentacles, because 5 gold is definitely worth more than stopping the tentacle generation and auto-attacking. What's more, is that many players who are vessels are already low, and those high AD ratios for tentacle hits don't help any.\n\nTeammates should KNOW that a vessel has to kill those tentacles in order to be able to back safely, or even stay alive.

When she pulls the spirit out of the vessel, the other team can intervene while she and hers are wailing on it.\n\nBesides that I have no idea why her skillshot needs to be any more of a \"team game\" than any other skillshot. If you get hit by a skillshot you should be punished. That's how it is for Thresh, Blitz, Naut, Varus, Morgana, Zyra and Lux, if you don't dodge it you IMMEDIATELY suffer, no minigames.\n\nThe fact of the matter is it's already got a ton of counterplay, and any more would make it pretty much useless. \nFor one it's a skillshot, so to start with, you can dodge it. \nSecondly, it doesn't immediately do anything to you. It  allows her and her team to attack your vessel to deal some damage to you, assuming you don't run. So you could always try and fight her which will usually end with you not being cursed but taking some damage, or you can immediately run, saving yourself from taking almost any damage at all.\nFrom there, all you have to do is keep moving, or kill three tentacles and your done.  As it is right now, Illaoi's E has the potential to do absolutely nothing even when you land it.  \n\nIf you made it so that someone's teammates could kill the tentacles for credit, then it would be absolutely useless come late game. Or in a duo lane. \n\"Hey guys I pulled Mundo's spirit lets kill i-- awww he ran... Well at least he's cur-- aww he's safe. What a good use of mana that was.\"\nAnd before you say that punishes teamwork, sometimes teamwork doesn't mean everyone stick together and shoot everything that moves. When Nocturne or Rengar ults, sure, you want your entire team to stick together, butt to butt. But when Brand or Varus Ults you pretty much want the exact opposite. Do their ults punish teamwork?\n\nObviously, I'm biased.

Illaoi uses E successfully on an enemy champion.\n\n2. Illaoi and her teammates defeat the spirit of said champion.\n\n3. Champion consistently generates tentacles near him/herself that focus attacks on him.\n\n4. Champion has to last hit three tentacles to break the curse.\n\nThe first part of this ability is Illaoi's skill at using a skillshot vs. a champion or champions skill level(s) dodging her skill shot.\n\n^ Champion vs. champion\n\nThe second part of this ability takes Illaoi and any nearby allies may cooperate to destroy the spirit and the enemy champions may cooperate to prevent that from happening.\n\n^ Team vs. team\n\nThe third part of this ability is where if the spirit is broken then the effected champion must undergo a trial where they generate and are attacked by nearby tentacles.\n\n^ Effected enemy champion vs. him/herself\n\nThe final part of this ability is the part where the tentacles are destroyed. The champion's team may help or even hinder their efforts in this by not understanding how Illaoi's abilities work and/or mistakenly last hitting the tentacle instead.\n\n^ Effected enemy champion vs. his own team\n\nIllaoi's E is a signature ability that is only replicated somewhat vaguely by abilities such as {{champion:26}} bombs and {{champion:18}} stuff. This is because these abilities will already do damage but they have the potential to hurt the enemy team more if their team is bad at dealing with it.\n\nExample: Zilean can throw a bomb on an enemy to almost guarantee damage. However, the effected enemy may bring the bomb close to another enemy to net Zilean even MORE damage.\n\nExample: Tristana can use her Explosive Charge and have the same thing happen as above where the effected enemy can walk too close to one of his allies (or vice versa) and net her more damage.\n\nWith Illaoi's E it is the same me vs. my own team concept. It is unique in that it is new and not completely understood by the community yet, and just like sometimes people wander too close to an enemy Zilean bomb, sometimes people that understand the ability still last-hit a tentacle without thinking about it.\n\nThe ability is balanced in its primary mechanics in that it starts with a 'self skill vs. enemy skill' test (which is fair), moves immediately to a team vs. team mind-game to kill or preserve the champion spirit, and may end with a 'self vs. self and own team' trial where the champion struggles to break the curse.\n\nWith Illaoi having no other form of CC and no other real flavor to her kit besides WHAP you got hit with a tentacle, I think her E is perfect. It grants her that sweet little bit of CC and adds in a hard punishing skill shot grab that is no more oppressive than a blitz or thresh grab.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FistOfSharkiesha","date":"2015-12-13T22:35:35.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think her massive ranged abilities are part of what will prevent her from being balanced.
