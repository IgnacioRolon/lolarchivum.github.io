If he waits until 2100g then you can get your own BF sword and probably either the brawler's or the dagger, either way you'll be ahead because his support is only half effective.\n\nOr course, this is all subject to change depending on lane interactions, if Soraka dies early to a gank then you can delay the Executioner's, if you are seriously ahead in CS or if the enemy adc doesn't trade well, too.\n\nedit: I missed the second question :P going back early actually gives you a power spike of your own, you are now 15 AD ahead from the enemy and you're cutting all his healing in half on every trade. Of course your skills won't do much until you get the big items but if you use your advantage wisely, you can delay the enemy's power spike as well.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2016-09-07T08:08:15.020+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"FFS can you supports pls buy sight stone?\n\nSeriously, nobody cares about your Rabadon's Deathhat rush.\n\nIf I could save so many lives by spending a mere 800 gold I friggin' would!!!\n\neight{{item:2049}} friggin'{{item:2049}} hundred{{item:2049}} gold{{item:2049}} to{{item:2049}} save{{item:2049}} a{{item:2049}} million{{item:2049}} lives{{item:2049}} and{{item:2049}} get{{item:2049}} a{{item:2049}} million{{item:2049}} picks{{item:2049}} .\n\nTired of losing games because the support thinks they are playing s2/3 double doran's nidalee support","replies":[{"poster":"AramsAreBest","date":"2016-09-07T15:58:04.364+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're losing games because the enemy is better than you","replies":[{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2016-09-07T22:45:31.990+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"?\n\nNope.\n\nSupports building full glass cannon can lose games hard.
