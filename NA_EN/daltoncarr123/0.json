Then seconds later one of my teammates who wasnt paying attention / isnt a very good person bans him. This is the third time and it leaves me wondering why that is even allowed. This has been my worst gripe with league since it came out because i just want to play my character and he is banned by someone on my own team! If there is a definitive reason why this is allowed to happen i would like to know because it feels unfair to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-18T23:35:41.463+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know it sucks when someone bans the champion you were going to play, but there's a good chance they banned him so that the other team couldn't pick Yasuo. He's been pretty well known for being really strong in good hands, and really weak in the wrong hands, so he's seen a lot of ban time. My best suggestion for making sure nobody bans your champion is to play game modes without bans or try playing with friends where you can communicate your intentions better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2017-06-18T23:58:01.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's suppose Yasuo is stupidly overpowered in a patch. If last pick on my team declares Yasuo, I might still want to ban him, because enemy team is going to get a bunch of chances to pick him before last pick does.","replies":[]}]}
