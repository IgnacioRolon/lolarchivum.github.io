Make sure that you're logged into the game when you delete it, otherwise, when you log in, the client will re-download those item sets.","replies":[{"poster":"Lunæ","date":"2017-06-21T03:02:09.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! Thanks for your response.\n\nWhen you say to make sure I'm logged into the game, you mean at the main menu of the client, with the Overview, Patch Notes, etc.?\n\nI tried that, but it still redownloads the item sets when I log in. :/","replies":[]}]}]}
