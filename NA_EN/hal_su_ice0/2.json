I am a girl gamer and I have been playing this game for over two years now. Every day that I play this game, I see messages on my loading screens to give me something to read while I am waiting for my match to begin. And nearly every day for two years, while I have watched these messages as well as the graphics of the loading screen undergo significant development, I have faced the same sexist message, untouched by the changing forces of time: \"The tribunal overwhelmingly votes to punish racist or homophobic remarks.\" \r\n\r\nAs a girl gamer, whenever I press my Ranked Queue button, I do so mentally prepared to face the same concoction of alienation, flirtation, and misogynistic comments that I am subject to every time I introduce myself in the champion selection lobby. As a habitual feeder, I face even worse once the loading screen fades and my teammates find in me a target for their latent frustrations and anger. Frequently and predictably, I am called a bitch, a %%%%, a whore, a slut, and dehumanized on the basis of my gender. This \"anything goes\" attitude that so many players have towards girl gamers is one of the \"Goliaths\" of the online gaming world, and, in a way, the loading screen is my safe haven from this abuse. However, when I see the loading screen tip that so unfeelingly dismisses women and girls from its protective reach, I lose even that. Please, Riot Gaming, let's put an end to the exclusion of girls and women, who are targeted more vigorously by verbal abusers than any other minority on your game, from this loading screen tip. Let's send the right message to the players. Thank you.","replies":[]}
