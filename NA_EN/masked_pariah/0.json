Every game in the final 4 is just Ocean Mages and Glacial Pred Poison. Those comps really need a nerf and they should really buff other comps because they cant compete. Buffs should go out Rangers, Blademasters, Electric with reworks/new set bonuses to Desert, Warden, and Druids. Lastly there needs to be more characters in Druids, Woodlands, Steel, Crystal, Electric, Blade Masters, Cloud, Mystic, and Desert. Units that need a huge nerf are Olaf, Brand, Annie, and Kindred. Units that need buff are Azir, Neeko (Needs to use her ult on a group instead of her randomly throwing it on one person), Skarner (still), Maokai, Ornn, and Taliyah.\r\n\r\nThis is how the meta feels right now and I pointed out what a majority of players Ive talked to feel what should happen to the game. I honestly enjoyed TFT but the way the meta is I dont want to play it until things change.","replies":[{"poster":"Smyrage","date":"2019-11-29T19:04:23.104+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hot take here: something is really really wrong with the champion distribution and the pool size. Today I wanted to go Cloud &amp; Blademasters and even though nobody was going for Yasuo, I could only find like 5 of him the entire game? Meanwhile others were building their second lv2 Volibear and lv3 Kog'maw. This happens in many games. The small pool size seems really biased towards certain composition. For example it is extremely risky to build full Light, because the game somewhat barely gives Aatrox. Like really, in some games I didn't even get him dropped at all even though nobody was going for either Blademasters or Light.\n\nThose builds wouldn't be so strong, because e.g Predator heavily relies on getting champs to lv3. The problem is that the small pool size makes it way too easy through hyperrolling. Part of this problem is that Tier 5 champions aren't that potent like they were in Set 1 (except Singed). And even then the system seems to be biased towards Singed, because I get him dropped most frequently.","replies":[{"poster":"iwanttobebronze5","date":"2019-11-29T20:34:37.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup, I just posted about this a week ago. I was the only person in a game who built summoners, I hyper rolled at lvl6 then at lvl7 and I didn't get a single Annie or Yorick, meanwhile 3 ppl who built the same comp just got everything they needed. Also Aatrox and Soraka are probably the rarest units in the game. I see more Zed than Aatrox, no joke.\n\nIt would be actually better if it was rng because rigth now it is not!

Yas is probably the only easy unit to get to 2 stars.. Rng has allowed me to get 3 blade master bonus once and even then just got destroyed due to poor rng. Sadly, unless you throw the first few rounds so badly you get a chance at first carousel pick (and maybe a spat depending where you spawn on the carousel map/where the spat is) you won't build bm from spat items either.. Even if you get a couple of spat, you need good enough rng to get a bow off of creeps.. And for w/e reason, my creeps like giving me gold. When I do get items, they are very rarely bows.\nOh well, will keep doing the same ole pred/poison/zerker/olaf build every game..

There is a warden trait that gives a lots of armor... which is almost totally useless since 90% of the champions deal magic damage and the rest deal mostly true damage. Meanwhile, there is no counter against the ridiculous amount of AP damage. Mystic gives MR theoretically but there are two problems with it: 1. Soraka is so rare that I see way more Zed, YI, Lux, etc. than her 2. 40 MR is laughable, useless. When my Reksai with dragon claw and PD gets literally one-shot (100-0) by a Veigar I honestly don't see what is the point in building MR besides wasting resources.\n\nAatrox also needs a buff imo. I consider him as the weakest unit in the game. He needs way to much mana for ult but even then 90% of the times he just dies within his horribly long ult animation. Just buff his ult by reducing its mana cost and make his animations faster. I wouldn't buff Neeko and Maokai. Neeko is kinda broken when she hits a group with her ult. The fact she ults single targets sometimes is part of the rng that affects every other champion as well (veigar ults an already that unit or  Jax stuns a single target).","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThunderCraft","date":"2019-11-29T19:00:27.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"they should remove olaf from Glacial and place him on Electric complete bonus from glacial should come from a lux or a spatula.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tiamat Taric","date":"2019-11-29T16:25:32.047+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"I don't like building armor items and still being melted/one shot by ad champs or buying MR items and being melted/one shot by ap champs","replies":[]}]}
