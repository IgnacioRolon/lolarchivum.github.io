In this case (and in Blood Moon Yasuo's case) we did made colorblind adjustments. Did you happen to be using the colorblind mode setting? \n\nWe can definitely take another look at this. From what you're saying, this is **only** occurring from the enemy view?\n\nOh! Also, what graphics settings are you on? (High/Medium/Low)","replies":[]}]}
