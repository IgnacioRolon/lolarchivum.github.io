Hopefully some will work for you as well! \r\n\r\n1.\tEvery time you kill a minion check the mini map. \r\n2.\tMake sure your HUD scaling of your mini map is at 100. \r\n3.\tPress tab frequently to check and see who is showing on the map. When a player is highlighted white and glowing that means they are showing somewhere on the map. It&rsquo;s helpful to look and see where the people are on the map right after. This will help avoid getting roamed on by other laners and the jungler. \r\n4.\tIf you tunnel really hard in lane try setting a timer for every 10-30 seconds on your computer or phone, when the timer beeps check the mini map. \r\n5.\tSupporting is good way to get in the habit of checking the map frequently, as you don&rsquo;t have to worry about cs&rsquo;ing and you get in the habit of placing wards in great spots. \r\n6.\tI know it sounds clich&eacute; but warding is a great way on avoiding ganks, use the other tips to be sure you are checking your mini map frequently. \r\n6.A Placing deep wards in the jungle  can also help you know what side of the jungle the enemy jungler is on. Deep wards are especially good against junglers with invis. You will know where about they are and be able to react to it. (Eve, Shaco, bring back twitch? :P) \r\n7.\tWhen you are in a middle of fight with your lane opponent it is very important to keep checking the map/hitting tab. If you are getting collapsed on you will have time to back out or if you have no one coming for you, you can finish off your fight and potentially pick up a kill. \r\n8.\tPlaying champions with global ults can also be a great way to pay attention to the map. (Karthus, Soraka, Ezreal, etc.) Always looking for ways to pick up a snipe kill or heal up your allies will help you check the map more often. \r\n9.\tPlaying jungle usually forces you to pay attention to all lanes to set up your next gank destination. \r\n10.\tIf an ally pings that someone is coming to you several times or if you already saw it don&rsquo;t tell them to shut up and be rude to them even if it was annoying. Chances are next time you aren&rsquo;t paying attention and you are about to get ganked the team mate wont ping for you anymore and you could die. If you can always say something short like &ldquo;Ty for the ping&rdquo;. \r\n11.\tIf you are used to playing games that has the mini map in the left like Dota for example simply change it in the settings to be on that side. \r\n12.\tIf you play with screen lock, try getting used to playing without it, so you can scroll around the map and not just stay focused on yourself.\r\n13.\tUsing pings to communicate to your team is a great way to avoid your fellow team mates from ganks/roams. \r\n14.\tLastly time. It takes a lot of time to get yourself in the habit of looking at the mini map frequently. \r\nThanks for reading summoners! Hopefully I gave you a new tip you can try out in your next game!\r\n\r\n{{champion:92}}  &quot;Learn from your mistakes&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"Colonel k1","date":"2015-07-21T17:57:18.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should make a video guide for this, would be really useful.","replies":[{"poster":"xLizzi","date":"2015-07-22T13:12:19.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks will think about it ^.^ bump","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SLangedEdge","date":"2015-07-20T23:52:33.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably help most of lower lvl LoL players, play with your camera unlocked.  You know where your champ is, why do you need to look directly at 'em in the middle of our FOV.  You move the camera more towards areas where ganks could come from or behind your lane enemy where backup could come from.","replies":[{"poster":"xLizzi","date":"2015-07-21T16:59:14.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for your tip ^.^ bump","replies":[]}]}]}
