I'll play league for part of the day with no problem, but then this will pop up and cause all kinds of issues.  It starts when the timer hits zero on champ select. Instead of going into the loading screen for the game, it just sits on champ select for awhile, then tells me there was an unknown error. It still doesn't go anywhere, and I eventually have to close out of the client. \n\nHere's where the big issues start.  It takes forever to log back in after this happens.  It'll confirm my account, then just sit there without opening the client for minutes at a time.  Then either one of two things happens: I get the same \"Unknown error\" message and I'm forced to close it, or the client will finally load, and I can reconnect to the game I couldn't load into before.  This is causing a LOT of problems because I never know when it's going to happen.  Most of the time I can return to the game, but at that point it's half or more over, and my being there doesn't do any good.  I want to emphasize this doesn't always happen, and usually I can play 2-3 games before it starts.\n\nAfter I get done with whatever game this occurs on, it does the same thing over and over again. Logging out and back in does no good, and it still takes forever to login again. I've run the scan on the patcher to no avail, and shut down and restarted my computer several times. For whatever reason, if I let it sit over night, I can usually get 2-3 games in again the following afternoon before this all starts over again.\n\nI really don't want to get reported (though I'm sure I already have) for not being able to load into game/closing out of the client while a game is being made because the client refuses to let me load in.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-08T15:35:15.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really sounds like there are issues with your client not being able to create a stable link to the server during specific hours of the day. This often happens if there are ISP routing changes being made during peak hours in order to mitigate network congestion. Before we take a look at your route during the problematic period, we'll first want to ensure your local network settings are compatible with our [connection troubleshooting guide.\n](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nLet me know if you continue to see connection errors after completing that guide.","replies":[]}]}
