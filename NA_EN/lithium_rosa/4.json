It was supposed to make it so you can get gold if behind, but in practice all it does is make it so if you win a miracle fight, you cant counter push because all your lanes are getting slammed in by waves.\n\nI have no idea why they would give you minions pushing, say its to gain gold but also at the same time make stalling and turtling completely unviable tactics.","replies":[{"poster":"Odinakos","date":"2016-02-05T10:45:17.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The minion pushing was implemeted in order to put the burden on the winning team to seal the deal. If they derp around and not take objectives they give an advandage to the enemies aka farm more. But if they actively engage they have an advandage as lanes will push. \n\nNonetheless this was for the extreme high skill games (or even only competitive) where derping around an objective was the normal and waiting 20 minutes to win a game you actually won at 15 minutes. For us, the common mortals it makes a little difference as games tend to become snowbally.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"optimalroat","date":"2016-02-05T10:11:56.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see why they increased the death timer? I mean, sure, league isn't really punishing you when you're dying, if if Riot wanted too, this is definitely not the way to go, sort of, it's too long way to early in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wizzleboom","date":"2016-02-05T01:16:34.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah the death timers are way too long.

With other MOBAs out Riot has started to make some changes to overall games. Asking people to play a 40-50 min ranked game on summoners rift, and only rewarding 19ish LP while trying to match and group players so they maintain a 35-50% Win/Loss Ratio means people have to spend alot of time to play enough games to even matter. \n\nBy increasing death timers Riot obviously punishes players more for dieing, but what they really are doing is decreasing the overall length of games by greatly increasing the ability for teams to press their advantage and takes objectives pushing them closer to victory faster.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gypsyleeboy","date":"2016-02-05T10:42:28.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"This game neeeeeded increased death timers.
