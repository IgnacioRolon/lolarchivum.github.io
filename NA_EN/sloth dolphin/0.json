{"poster":"Sloth Dolphin","date":"2016-09-03T17:05:56.848+0000","title":"Account Hack-Support Contacted/No Response","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My brothers account was hacked- I am on here and he is not which will be explained in a second.\n\nTuesday my brother received an email that he needed to place a number in to change something in his account but he did not log in since Aug 28th which was a duo match with me ( he played Vayne). \nMy brother emailed riot support concerned that there was a potential hack.  He also informed them he was changing his password. \nNext evening my brother received 3 more emails while he was working.  2 of them contained account changing attempts again and one was someone used a paypal account for 20.00 ( he checked his paypal wasn't his own). Third one was in a foreign language ( Korean maybe? idk)\nMy brothers email is also 2 way verified and he does not share the account with anyone for clarification. He checked his email-no one attempted etc and he would know b/c a text would also be sent to his phone hence 2 way verification. \n\nAnyhow, as he attempted to email riot he couldn't log into his account so he tried the client...it said his account was in a different region and to log into that said region. ( NA was original region)\nSo, he did start another ticket of course but connected to same email just stating his account has been hacked. \nHe also attempted to contact Riot on facebook this week after waiting 2 days for a response, we are unsure if there is any other way to have some sort of contact quicker. It has been a few days and I have checked his games played and seen that someone has been playing on his account??!!\nMy brother attempted to log again to check and of course same \" change region\" message came up. \n\nWe are unsure what to do next or if there is any way to help the process but my brothers account is just gone and  being used...and it feels like there is nothing we can do about it and he surely feels that way since he can't even make a forum post to say what is going on or log into riot to add to a ticket etc. \n\nI know not to post anything personal on here  but his account was originally NA and its an estimated 4 years old. 2 seasons gold and many skins,  he believes he didn't have any cards saved but he ofc spent money using a card in the game ( he has taken care of card changes). \n\n-once again no idea how this happened, checked malware etc.  Also, no attempts on his email etc.\nEither way we/he feel(s) quite helpless at this point and just trying to get some sort of help/response because we have heard that sometimes if it has been to long you lose your account and he has put quite some time in the game. \n\nI won't post anything personal but if RIOT does get this forum post i'll mention the confirmation number for support tickets are\n\n23114261\n23122881\n\nsorry there are 2 tickets but he couldn't add to the first one as stated above. We are just trying to get some sort of help/info because it is kind of tough to just watch your account being used by someone you don't know and the account being tampered with.\n- I am also confused on why it tells my brother the region is changed but I am in NA and can see his account has been played and the games played since he last played? I figured if the region was changed I wouldn't see his account on my friends list? \nI can confirm all of this for I have been shown everything by him as well and I also know he has saved the emails received. \nThanks,\nSlothDolphin","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-03T17:53:34.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I checked the situation out, and see that the ticket has been escalated to an account specialist.
