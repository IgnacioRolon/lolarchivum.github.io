Additionally, there&#039;s not even a point in buying that skin anymore, since their abilities are pretty much the same as in the default skin.\r\n\r\nHowever my biggest concern is about the Beast Hunter and the Dawn Chaser Skins.\r\nI LOVE their models so much and I hate to say, that all the ability effects make the skins as a whole look terrible, but they just do.\r\nThe problem is, that you took the idea of Sejuani beeing a &quot;frosty&quot; leader away into a completely different direction.\r\nShe either is riding on a dinosaur or a lion and the ice theme just doesn&#039;t fit with these themes anymore!\r\nI beg you to at least make some recolors of the abilities (at least of the passive, as it is incredibly ugly imo) for at least these two skins just to match their theme. Also it doesn&#039;t make any sense anyway to make Sejuani sit on an ice saddle with the Dawn Chaser Skin. It just feels stupid to me.\r\nI recommend you to take that skin a step towards some more golden colors.\r\nFor the Beast Hunter one, it may look good to give it some red.\r\nI don&#039;t really know about that one, but the current icy blue just looks bad on both of them.","replies":[{"poster":"paisy","date":"2017-04-19T14:49:38.004+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pre release","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2017-04-19T17:25:37.949+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's why it's important to get feedback threads like this out right now, because once it's pushed to live significant changes will no longer be actionable.","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2017-04-19T21:45:19.785+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, I agree. \n\nI wish the OP had a slightly more respectful tone...
