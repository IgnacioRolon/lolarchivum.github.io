My account \"Roarcraft Lover\" was hacked today and I've spent a lot of money on the account but I haven't received a reply or anything yet, and I tried to provide information for my account as well as I possibly could, but I was sad I didn't get to play today since the account still seems to be hacked. The reason for why I got hacked is because I clicked a link that a trusted real life friend sent me, and after I talked to him he told me he wasn't even playing at the time I received the link so I talked to another friend and he said it was some sort of \"phisher\" (not too sure with what that is). I'm not familiar with how long riot takes to respond to hacked accounts, but I was really hoping I could get the account. My ticket number for the ticket that I filed to recover my account is (#30791732) Please someone help me out with how long it would take for a reply from riot or what will happen if someone did something malicious with my account. I'd really like to get access of my account as soon as possible and I love to play league everyday. Thank you to everyone who tries to help me! Riot plz help us.{{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-30T21:35:43.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries Papa! Sometimes the account recovery team's queue can get a little backed up, but typically you'll have a respond in less than a day. I went ahead and checked up on your ticket, and it looks like Mondday has responded already! Make sure to check for that ticket ^_^","replies":[]}]}
