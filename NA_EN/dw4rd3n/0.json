Seems like an easy fix.\r\n\r\nLeague in 4k looks amazing, but there is one problem that makes it almost unplayable... The size of the cursor. All of the character models and the map looks great. Although some of the hud icons don't get scaled to 4K, that's not an issue. In the last patch, the health bar update introduced proper scaling in 4k too. The only problem is that the cursor stays the same resolution, meaning that it's 1/4 the scale on 4k. This becomes a huge problem in teamfights, especially over certain champions. \r\nCheck out the linked video for what I mean. (watch for 10 seconds in full screen and to spot the cursor) Keep in mind, when you're playing, you have to look around as well, so you need to be able to find the cursor at a glance.\r\n\r\nit would be really awesome if riot could fix this. Even simply scaling up the current cursor icon would be a great fix that I'd imagine takes a lot less work.\r\nI'm kinda new to the forums here. Is there a way to bring this to riot's attention?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-11T21:59:39.040+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Snap....yea that would be *really* frustrating to play with.

Really hope they're able to figure it out. It's a shame that players who spend thousands of hours a year on this game still have to play in 1080p. I think this is especially tragic for pros. They would be willing to throw out the cash for great peripherals and everything, but they are still stuck with 1080p. If you haven't gotten a chance to see this game in 4K, I'd do in the next time you get ahold of a 4K display cuz I think this is the single biggest way to improve how the game looks.

Converting the healthbars over into new tech allowed us to make them support 4k. Cursors and minimap icons and some other less important UI bits are still way too small as you noted.\n> \n> Converting those other elements is not simple and not something we would want to take on, but there might be a stopgap solution which just allows them to scale.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PowerSmoker","date":"2017-12-29T12:04:07.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I use YOLO mouse and works Great in League @ 4k","replies":[]}]}
