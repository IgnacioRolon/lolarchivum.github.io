For 2 consistent games I did not speak anything in the chat or flame them at all. But after the second game when it happened again in the third game I asked them to stop feeding and when we hit the mark that everyone was fed I asked them to ff at 20 mins. They would flame me  because I ask them to ff and tell them that they should not feed anymore and play safe. They feed like hell and I try to ask them to group but what they do instead is ask everyone to report me and feed more we end up loosing again and the bot lane reports me after 4 games of my struggle and not flaming them I get a message that I have been permanently banned. I can agree I was toxic few months ago but if u see me now I do not flame and only chat for strategizing but what instead I get is a report for no reason even though I didn&#039;t flame or feed and I get the ban . FOR nothing at all. Does riot ban these days just for typing in chat that pls stop the feed and the opponent  is too fed so lets just ff ??? I need a proper justification as to why I get ban when I don&#039;t flame anymore in chat. Is telling ur team that don&#039;t feed offensive now. They report me cuz of telling them that they fed and when I report them they don&#039;t get banned . Is this the right way to justify riot ?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2017-11-27T20:21:24.928+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why did you edit your chat logs when you posted them?

idea that nobody is allowed to ever become frustrated in a video game no matter what the other players do. it is actually insanely pathetic to hold this attitude in a video game with so many players that purposely play against people in their own team and in a game that simply has winners and losers. to punish people for raging in some games in game with winners and losers and insanely many forms of sabotaging players that simply are ignored totally and will never be punished is simply pathetic. i agree that you should punish players for hate speech things because hate speech things to not really have something to do with simply being angry when a player lets you down or a team lets you down.\n\nnow people will come and tell me that you are supposed to control your emotions in a game and that you simply do not belong into a game when you are not able to do that. the thing is that this is complete nonsense because every player has a limit. the fact that almost everyone in the community knows that sabotaging games is basically not punished at all leads to players who just want to have nice games into frustration at some point when they continuously run into players who let them down totally for basically no reason at all. you ignore these things for some games. but nobody ignores these things forever.\n\nthere is also another terrible misunderstanding to the idea to simply control your emotions and never show anything negative towards anyone. this is a video game. in a video game you want to have emotions and it is simply impossible to demand every dedicated player to never be negative no matter what happens. i find it hard to believe that the riot staff does not want dedicated players in the game but i have to accept it.\n\ni also got permabanned recently for writing trash team a few times in a game in which i had a team that totally let me down and then blamed me or tried to find excuses for me having a terrible game. people who let others down to have a reason to blame them are actually much worse than people who are just angry because letting people in your team down purposely leads to disadvantages for your team.\n\ni want to make clear that i do not think that writing trash team a few times is simply the correct way to go in such a case. now you could say that i already explained that i deserve to be permabanned because i admitted that the things i wrote are not acceptable. and here comes the part why this is nonsense. if i were doing that in every game that i play in which get treated like this i could totally understand that my actions deserve to be punished. but the thing is that i write things like this in less than 100 games and also in this case i certainly did not write anything similar in the 100 games before this game. i just happened to deal with insanely negative players who enjoyed to sabotage over a really long period of time. it was not even really that this was a game in which i got attacked really much or treated insanely terribly. the team certainly was not a nice team that rather looked for excuses to let other players in the team down than to simply play the game. but i basically never have a nice team because i play alone most of the time and then i simply have to endure people who come together to sabotage me and things like that. it was one long period of time of many in which i had to endure extremely  negative players who enjoyed to sabotage. the thing was that i simply was at my limit.\n\nnow you will say that i must be a toxic player because i must have happened to have had a 2 week ban before and i would never get a 2 week ban without a good reason. i still do not know for what i got the 2 week ban. the games that were listened there together with my comments do not justify any punishment because i was defending myself without insulting other players at best. i totally stopped insulting players and things like that. but simply defending yourself or someone else is not allowed in this game and asking people to play seriously because the game is not over and there is no need to let everyone down because you still see clear chances to win a game are all things that are not allowed. even making calls and explaining where to place wards in order to get important objectives is not allowed because people will be offended when you tell them what to do eventhough it is only in order to win a game. it is all considered as talking down on others. just giving orders when people are not knowing what to do next is considered as talking down on others. all these things lead to frustration for me. that i am simply not allowed to behave like a normal human being in nothing more than a video game with a really negative community leads to frustration for me.\n\nthe thing i am trying to say here simply is not that i am allowed to let my frustration out on everyone all the time. the thing i am saying is that it just happens that players let their frustration out on others at some point in the game when they just encountered enough negative actions of this community and that it is a terrible idea to work against this. this is still a game with winners and losers on top of that. in a game with winners and losers you should not expect everyone to act like he is having discussion about a serious topic with others. why would people act like this in a game? why does everything has to be so pathetically serious in this game? why do people who sabotage basically never get punished on the other side eventhough they cause by far the most frustration? why are emotions so terrible in a game? i think there simply needs to be more empathy for emotions in this game. the games take quite some time. the games can be stressful.\n\ni also do not think permabanning is reasonable at all. permabanning players leads to much more angry players who come back and do not hold back at all anymore. that leads to a even worse community. i also think that this is extremely over the top in cases in which people did not use hate speech. i agree that there is no room for hate speech in a single good community. but a punishment like this is so far over the top that it is just not being able to be defended like it is in my case. if you ban me for having 1 angry game out of more than 100 for example then you basically have to ban 20% of the players of your community because definately basically 20% of the players of your community have 1 angry game out of more than 100. why am i banned and why are others not banned is what you could ask now? i am playing alone and often being blamed and attacked and reported by people who come together to play because i am not a part of them. also i am often demanding players to not sabotage when players sabotage other people and so i often write a few things in the games that i play. and now you think that it does not make sense what i write because if i was not such a terrible person then i would not get punished and so i must be a terrible person. but there is one important last part of information that i want to share and that many of the people like me have in common and that explains quite well how the people like me get punished in the end. IN THE END! IN THE END! i am talking about the number of games played and the insane amount of negativity that had to be endured during all these times and the insane amount of people who abused the report system. there are simply so many games played with people who only look to fight their own team in every possible way who abused the report system that eventually you will get punished for something at some point. and when you get punished you are in a place where every tiny thing gets you punished again. you do not need to attack players. you just need to write a few things in a game that are simply related to winning the game and have someone reporting you. and people who play the game much know that there are always players who are reporting people who they did not like to play with because of misunderstandings or simply mistakes that were made in the game or other things like not getting enough attention in a game eventhough it would not even have been useful and things like that. every tiny thing gets you punished when you got into that place.\n\nwe are not all in diamond where people actually know how to work around shared information.\n\nwe are not all having the nice atmosphere of being in diamond and having people to work around shared information. most of us get told to \"be calm\" when we try to be helpful with certain things we write. most of us have to \"be calm\" instead of writing things that can lead to advantages for the team.\n\ni played far more than 10000 games. many people played even far more than 10000 games. but really much more people did not play even close to as many games as i did. are players like me who need 10000 games to get permabanned for ridiculously small things really so terrible or are players like me who get permabanned after 10000 games for ridiculously small things not quite acceptable for the community compared to all the new people who wish \"cencar\" and death to families in cryptic ways all the time? the people who wish \"cencar\" and death to families in cryptic ways that are not noticed have many more games to play than people like me needed to get punished. many people like me are not doing all these things. they still get punished first because of often really questionable punishments in the past. who do you want to get punished first? someone who is new or someone who is just a typical player with a huge amount of games?\n\nwould you throw someone like me who is postive and encouraging in at least 50% of the games and meaningufully negative in around 1% of the games into the same category like someone who uses hate speech consistently? would you rather have someone like me who is positive and encouraging in at least 50% of the games and meaningfully negative in around 1% in the game than someone who uses hate speech?\n\ni also want to add that i almost never encountered a player that i wished to be permabanned because i think almost nobody in the game deserves to be permabanned given the state the communty is in.","replies":[{"poster":"justsomeloser","date":"2017-12-04T15:03:49.599+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i actually feel the need to add even more to that. i had time to think about the things that i wrote and wanted to use the chance to make them even more transparent. i am sure certain people will no tlike what writing here but i am already their enemy in some way you could say. you could understant that if you knew how often i contacted the support because of this case in the past already before i got punished or when i could not understand why certain players got punished while other players did not get punished.\n\ni wanted to kill 2 arguments that i read all the time and that i think are extremely questionable. these 2 arguments are mainly used by the community to defend the system. i want to make clear that in my opinion the people who defend the system with these arguments are just trying to either defend themselves or presenting themselves to be above the ordinary player who just plays the game because they want to create the image of themselves that they care about justice more than everyone and simply are the better people.\n\none of these arguments is that the terms of use say that you are not allowed to be attack other players verbally no matter what happens or you will be punished. while it is fine to defend that idea and to not allow players to attack other players verbally there is a huge problem. people who \"troll\" and sabotage are also not following the terms of use and these people do not get punished. that means that there is created quite some unpunished injustice in the game that should be there. and that leads to people who become frustrated over having to face people in their teams constantly who \"troll\" and sabotage without having a chance to even defend themselves or being allowed to quit the game so that they will not be affected by this negativity. but they have to endure all the negativity without being protected and are not having a chance to noe be affected. muting will not work.\nmuting only works if players attack you verbally. the idea that people can only attack you with words is simply wrong. the idea that people should not try to convince people to play seriously with words or try to defend themselves when they are attacked by multiple people and for the majority of the games is also simply not acceptable when the community is in such a state. nobody should demand that of someone in the community.\n\nthe other thing goes in line with what i just said. often people get punished for defending themselves or trying to convince other players to play seriously. people then say that it is against the rules to attack other players like this. you have a report fuction in this game. you all know the report fuction really well. there is not one point in it that tells you that talking to people in a reasonable way is against the rules. still people act like it is against the rules. people even act like telling people what to do in certain cases is against the rules. that is all nonsense. the people who complain about every comment are simply the same people i mentioned before who think they are above everyone else and nobody should even dare to talk to them or tell them what to do. they make themselves believe that they defend the standards of the community with that while all they do is defending their image that they created for themselves. they make themselves belive that they are the better people who defend justice and for that reason nobody is allowed to tell them what to do and by not allowing anyone that they think they enforce justice and so on. it simply is a circle of massaging their image.\n\ni also never see apologies when someone is unbanned. it does not happen often but there are cases in which people got unbanned. it is always said in a way that implicates that they can be happy that they got this treatment because if they did not deserve it. i do not like this attitude towards the community. when your system is not working correctly and people get punished who should not get punished then you should apolohize to them and tell them to make changes. it does not matter if they did not behave perfectly in every game they played ever. nobody behaves always perfectly and especially in a game it should be even more obvious. that these things happen it means that you made mistakes when you created your system or made changes to it. you are responsible. but instead you put the blame on the community. i personally do not think this is correct.\n\nyou simply are not supposed to build justice on the shoulders of injustice. that there are people that need to be unabanned makes it insanely obvious that there are still people who need to get unbanned. i doubt you want to tell me you looked at every case that ever happened and took your time to analyze it. if you want to tell me that then i will simply ignore such a statement because it would be pathetic. it is simply wrong to justify casualties to enforce justice because that implies that there is injustice already. i thought this is clear. it obviously was not clear.\n\nthe person who is responsible for this system should start to think about the damage that has been dealt by all these mistakes and should stop putting the blame on the community as if there were no problems. on top of that the person who is in charge of the person who is responsible should start asking questions why there are these mistakes in the system and why these unjustified punishments occur and why there is no responibilty taken. i contacted the support many years ago to talk about these problems in the system. many years later the problems in this system did not change and i needed a really huge amount of messages to get told by the support to not discuss the problems with the support and instead go to the boards. i contacted the support because i did not want to talk publicly about all this because i was sure things will change and people will listen and people will think. but here i am in the boards now talking about all this publicly eventhough i do not care about the opinions of people who are not playing the game and rather want to comment here because they think they know it all better. i wanted to address my concerns to the people who matter but obviously the people i talked to did not want to listen.","replies":[{"poster":"justsomeloser","date":"2017-12-04T15:30:07.612+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i also want to mention the example with a group of people playing basketball that was made by riot tantram. i want to address that example. if you are in a group of people and tell \"kys\" to someone you would get punished was what was told there if i remember correctly. it would have been nice if riot tantram could have looked at it from more than just a single point of view. besides the fact that i absolutely doubt that anyone would take you seriously for telling \"kys\" i obviously agree that usually that should not be said. but everyone who does sports with friends and knows how it is when someone in the team is totally not motivated and does not really try will agree that in most cases you would exclude that player from the game if he/she does not apologize and he/she does not change the attitude and starts playing seriously with the friends again. if you compare that example of basketball to league then you will realize that in league you do not have the possibility to exclude someone of your team or even have the chance that someone apologizes to your team. it is definately not comparable to sports in that way because there the people who manage the situation are the people who play the game. also the idea that someone is not motivated to be a useful part of the team is not mentioned because that would lead to trouble for explaining how the system works. and so also that people would get frustrated and angry and certainly say not so nice things about that person who is not having a good attitude after some time is not entertained because it would also cause trouble for explaining the system and justifying the idea that nobody will usually react to certain actions who is not a nice person. as you can see there are many possibilities that all work together that are not entertained and are treated as if they have nothing to do with eachother for reasons i do not want to understand. that actions lead to reactions after some time is not a secret and the person who is in charge of this all should question why this is the base to start from for enforcing justice. the game is played by humans. humans can become frustrated and angry. there is still time to accept that and take care of people who are really a problem and not just average people who like to play the game how it is supposed to be played.\n\ni wrote enough.\n\ni doubt i can change anything because i wrote all these things often enough in the past already and i do not see a good future for the game if things continue like they are at the moment. more players will be come frustrated. more frustrated players will be punished. the players who cause this will still be protected and will still feel the impact of their actions when they sabotage and report others. and they will report others because that is a part of their actions that make them feel so powerful. and they actually are powerful. it is a circle and it will continue to be like this as long as you listen to the people who do not even play the game and are only found here to write messages about how good everything is.","replies":[{"poster":"Lyndris","date":"2017-12-04T20:43:15.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I likely should not respond, seeing as I did not read the entirety of your post**s**.
