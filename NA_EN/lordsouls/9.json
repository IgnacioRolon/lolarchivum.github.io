If you have had leaves recently, then it's likely you will recieve a lower priority queue.  The best way to overcome this is by resolving whatever is causing you to leave.  I'd be happy to help, but I need some more information on what's going on.  When exactly are you crashing in-game?  Do you receive any error responses and what does it say, or is it a bugsplat?  Let me know!","replies":[]}]}
