The great thing about Windows 64-bit is that it can run 32-bit programs just fine. There's no way to make a 32-bit program turn into a 64-bit program, but that's okay because you should have no issues running it. For more information on the differences between 32 and 64-bit, check out [Microsoft's FAQ.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15056/windows-7-32-64-bit-faq)\n\nIf you have issues installing or patching League, let me know more details and I can assist you. :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
