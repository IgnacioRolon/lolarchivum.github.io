To clarify, I was not the one getting 'S', on one normal game, as Soraka, I've been playing with two friends. One of my friend had earned an 'S' but I did not get a crate. A recent game, as Nasus, I had won the game with a random earning an 'S', still I did not get a crate. \r\n\r\nI believe anyone earning an 'S' would earn me a chest (assuming I have yet to earn a chest on that champion). I checked my \"collection\" tab, the champions I referenced, I have yet to earn chests with yet. I also the amount of chests I can earn (on the profile), still stacked to a full four. I hope someone can explain if I'm understanding my situation wrong or if this is some sort of in-client issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-29T02:19:24.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you happen to have a screenshot of that S? I'm not currently seeing any S's on Soraka, but that might just be a delay with the game being recorded to our servers just yet. \n\nShoot me that screenshot if you happen to have one so I can reference that, and if it that game just happened give it a bit of time to record properly.","replies":[{"poster":"Shadow3750","date":"2017-09-29T03:16:51.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can say with full certainty that I did not earn an S, I'll go check if I can find something.\n\nEdit: This was the game with Soraka, [link](http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2607242264/33936293?tab=overview).

If you still think it's wrong, try to grab a screenshot somehow showing the S and that you were all in a premade that way we can see that something went wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Shadow3750","date":"2017-09-29T03:51:57.158+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, it's alright, thanks for looking into it and thanks for your time.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
