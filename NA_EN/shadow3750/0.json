There are games where the ping is normal and then there are games where I constantly disconnect, reconnecting with double my ping. Below are the list of things I have done on my end to fix my problem:\r\n\r\n1. I have disabled \"Allow the computer to turn of this device to conserve power\" for my network adapter,\r\n2. I have updated my network adapter,\r\n3. I have set up WiFi range extenders from the router to my room,\r\n4. I am using the \"WLAN Optimizer\" software,\r\n5. I have run the \"Hextech repair tools\" in administrator mode (firewall exceptions, system clock sync apply here).\r\n\r\nI have yet to try \r\n1. Directly connecting to the router,\r\n2. Re patching the game,\r\n3. Re installing the game.\r\n\r\nTo clarify: I have no issues when not playing the game i.e. browsing the store, main home page, summoner profile.\r\n\r\nIs there anything else I might be able to try ? I hope this issue gets resolved soon.

I suggest also following each step of our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to supplement your troubleshooting.  Make sure to go over each one there, because even if your net is fine elsewhere you can still have problems specifically with the game server.
