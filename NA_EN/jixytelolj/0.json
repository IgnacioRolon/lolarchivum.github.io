When I try to open my League of Legends, the logo appears for a second and then disappears. And the patcher does not open!!! But when I reinstall it, it works. But once I play a few games and close league, it stops working again. And the problem is I have two League of Legends launchers. One for EUW, and one for the Korean server. They all worked perfectly until two days ago. In my task manager it says that the League Patcher is running but I cannot see it. It says in the Processes that LoL Patcher and the PvP.net kernal is running. And I don't have any antivirus. Please Help me I am really desperate to play but I can't enjoy what I love.\n\n\n\nSpecs\n------\nCPU : 6th GEN Intel Core i7 6700HQ 2.6 GHz\nGPU : Nvidia Geforce GTX 960M\nRAM : 8GB\nStorage : 1TB HDD + 128GB SSD\nOperating System : Windows 10\n","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-15T23:51:03.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may be experiencing this if League isn't assigned the right system permissions to run properly. League requires specific permissions because it accesses and interacts with a lot of files that reside outside of the League folder.
