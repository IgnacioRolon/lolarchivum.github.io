But so far along the way, this game is so toxic it makes it painful to play. I would say 1/10 games, if that, I get a decent match. Where both sides are nice, and work together as a team. No flaming, grieving, taunting the enemy team etc. Every other game, there is at least 1 intentionally feeder, most of the time tilted for one reason or another. There are definitely flamers every game, whether it be your own team or your opponent, taunting you, saying you suck, go kill yourself, uninstall please, pleasantries like that.\r\n\r\nQuite aware there is a mute button, and have had to mute all before as it was ridiculous. Yet, I report, and report, and report, and nothing comes of it. You have players going 0/32 yet, running straight down lane feeding, all because they didn&#039;t get a champ they wanted, a lane, weren&#039;t babysat for the 5 mins the game has been on. Players with obscene and inappropriate names, like ni**a, c**t, etc, nothing happens there. Great, we have a mute button, but there is nothing in place to deal with afkers and feeders. And they are fully aware that you can&#039;t ff until 20, because you need an unanimous vote, and they vote no to spite you. Even then, the vote may not go through. \r\n\r\nI honestly don&#039;t know what can be implemented, maybe a vote to kick a player, rather play a 4v5 than 4v6. But then there is the argument that you could have people gang up and vote off a player they don&#039;t like. Maybe make it an option only if they have died so many times, or straight consecutive deaths. Or don&#039;t make early voting unanimous, but majority. \r\n\r\nAnd the sad thing is, we are all learning the game and trying to be become better. So I don&#039;t know where these players think they are god&#039;s gift to earth as we are all sub 30 and unranked.","replies":[{"poster":"Drugoth","date":"2017-08-13T18:55:18.878+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Geez your stats for amount of inters and toxic flamers is a little bit on the egregious side.

No. They can hinder you in a few promos and matches but overall if you're skilled enough to climb you will (I'm gold and have no delusions about being better than where I'm ranked atm) \n\nHowever, I come across negative players all the time. Int feeders and hardcore kys flamers are rare, but tilting players that refuse to group or follow play calls and spam surrender/petty insults  are pretty common in my games.  *Its usually an after effect of autofill for either team. In my personal experience fighting and dodging over fill has become so common in rank that I pretty much quit queueing over it. It has nothing to do with me thinking \"oh I can't climb in this shit system\" but I can 100% say its less fun than just hitting up blind. \n\njs","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-08-13T19:12:58.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is a low-level problem, by the time you hit 30 you will see far less trash, scum and generally worthless individuals who seem to exist for no reason other than spreading their sadness.\n\nExcept if you decide to jump right into ranked and get deservedly placed in bronze V due to having zero experience.\n\nNormal Draft and Treeline tends to be the least toxic modes, Teeeline ranked also seems way chiller than SR ranked, it seems to be more adults and less raging brats trying to record Yasuo montages.\n\nAlso, a lot of the worst sub-30s are 'smurfs' (alt accounts) of people who got banned or in a state of total denial over being placed in the aforementioned Bronze V.

I can't remember exactly, but Bronze has about 30% of the players and Silver 40%. 30% of the players are shared between Gold, Plat, Diamond and challenger. The skillgap between the lower tiers is much larger and because of this, it is extremely rare to see anyone more than one tier above you (ie, a BIV would never see a BII).\n\nAnd frankly, Bronze is an order of magnitude less toxic than silver. Only time I've seen it get really toxic is when EU \"Silvers\" show up in NA Bronze V.","replies":[{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2017-08-18T05:36:10.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You two have such a small sample size to judge from.
