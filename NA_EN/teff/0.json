I'm not entirely sure how to explain what's going on, _but i'll try._\n\nIn game i'll lag, the timer still climbs, I don't get gold, can't use any abilities, but I can run around. I was talking to my buds, and apparently they can see me using my abilities. I've been trying to fix LoL on my PC for about 2-3 weeks now. I don't know if it's the game, my PC, or my connection. I just wiped my PC and re-installed windows &amp; LoL because nothing else I tried was working. I just tried to play a game, and it's doing the same thing. I spent a lot of time and money on this game, and I'm determined to find a way to fix it. So with that being said, any help is greatly appreciated. ;n ;\n\n**-Teff**","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-01T03:21:54.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh geez, from what your buddies said about being able to see your champ moving while you can't see anything happening really sounds like packet loss. \n\nPacket loss happens when your network is sending the game data to our servers, but some of that essential data gets lost or corrupted along the way, so when it gets back to you it's a bit of a jumbled mess. Your client tries to decipher what happened and catch you back up, and it the process it freezes and then speeds up. During that time you can see some pretty weird stuff like moonwalking/teleporting champions and such. \n\nLet's run a quick trace route to our servers to make sure of what we're dealing with. Use our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) with the game logs that had that weird lag, take a screenshot, and post it here so we can go over it together.","replies":[]}]}
