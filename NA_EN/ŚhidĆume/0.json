When the person who killed you has nothing that could have caused it, no red buff, no ignite, not minions or tower, nothing. I've even gone back and watched replays for some, and it just shows me living with 60 or so hp then randomly dying. {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} \r\n\r\nSlightly different subject but on some occasions i also look in death recap and a spell is shown with no name or photo it just says the summoner name and says the damage it dealt, does anyone know why that is?","replies":[{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2017-07-15T21:02:22.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about Deathfire Touch or Liandry's Torment? I've found those DOT abilities to be real killers (literally) several times.","replies":[{"poster":"ŚhidĆume","date":"2017-08-06T10:44:07.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know this was 22 days ago but for some reason i didnt get the notification for this till now. but nope its not either of those. I checked their masteries for deathfire and neither did they have liandry's. I just kinda die for no reason. I watched the replays to see if it was like a stray minion bullet or something and its not even that","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-15T20:49:51.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm that's interesting. Without some kind of video or screenshot it's a little hard to figure out what might have happened, but there may have been a stray auto-attack or minion that got that last hit on you. If you can grab a highlight of that I'd be more than happy to look over it for ya!\n\nAs for that death recap not showing the name of the attacks, it might be due to some minor file corruption. Try running a repair through the client options and let me know if that helps.","replies":[{"poster":"ŚhidĆume","date":"2017-08-06T10:42:30.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't had it happen in my past 20 games. But if it happens to me again ill be sure to get a highlight of it. Also i realise this was 22 days ago but for some reason i have only just received the notification in my boards profile","replies":[]}]}]}
