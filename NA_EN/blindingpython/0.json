Unlike previously however I was able to log in again and finish the game without it crashing a second time.

Didn't have any issues til this last round of patches, and even with the graphics on very low (previously played them on very high with ~100 FPS) it still happens.  Heard of similar issues with other players in game but haven't found a solution myself, or seen one in game or on forums.","replies":[]}]}
