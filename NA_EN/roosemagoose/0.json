Or does that not even matter.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The guy that I started playing League with always makes fun of me because I play League with a touchpad. I always kind of push him out of my head when it comes to that, but this guy went all the way to Plat. So I thought, \"Well, I can at least get to Gold then...?\" ...and then I played ranked for the first time in the secondish year I had been playing League. And then I sort of puked in my stomach and realized that I wasn't winning as much. Given, I had over a 1000 wins in normals before this happened, I wasn't just sitting around on my ass wishing that I wasn't a noob. So then I rationalized that people in ranked are probably just marginally better, and I'd been playing against far less great people in normals. So I played ranked, and played it and played it and played it... But after almost a good year or so, I feel no real change. I do my best to not go on tilt, I always stay calm, I decidedly choose not to tell people what to do, so that they can focus on their own game instead of worrying about some guy shitting on their head for being 0-8. But it still feels like I'm getting nowhere. Am I just bad at the game, or am I just getting cheated out of this because everyone else knows something I don't know. Because I feel like everyone feels like this. And then afterwards, the people who've made it just sort of smile and go, \"Just keep playing.\" I just don't want to feel like the time I've spent learning this game has been wasted. Years later, my friend is in Plat, but never has the time to duo with me, and the other people I play with don't care about ranked. It's lonely and I've got nobody to really relate with besides Youtube Leaguers. I'm not looking for a League boyfriend or something, just... I want to feel like I'm accomplishing something. And yet... I'm not. Despite far too much time put into this game, I can't even find myself making noticeable progress besides a slow crawl out of Bronze into Silver.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day all I want to know... is should I stop playing something that I'm never going to be good at. And the last thing I want is some kind of anime shout encouragement of \"But if you just continue to pour your hard work into it, love and happiness will overflow!\" kind of stuff. And at the same time, obviously, I get enough from the normal community of the \"well just don't feed dumbass\" mentality.\r\n\r\nI'm obviously asking too much, but... idk. What should I do.","replies":[]}
