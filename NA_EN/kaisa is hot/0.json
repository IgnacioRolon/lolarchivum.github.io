It lasts short to long, meaning it can either lose me a game or make it extremely hard. Thinking about just playing on my laptop till I figure out what the hell is wrong. The only time it does this is when I'm playing league.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-13T00:19:54.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It definitely sounds like it can the adapter itself, but I'd recommend trying to update the driver off the manufacturer's website before trying another adapter.\n\nLet me know if that caused any sort of change in what you're seeing.","replies":[{"poster":"CRYOATIC01","date":"2016-12-13T00:21:21.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow. a rioter. i didnt know you guys actually read these things XD","replies":[]}]}]}
