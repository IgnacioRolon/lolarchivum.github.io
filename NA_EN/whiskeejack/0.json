There was a Riot post saying they were trying to workshop the skin line to differentiate it more from the Championship ones, which is fine but given the delays runs into conflict with their Aforementioned funding commitment. \r\n\r\nNow we could see a new skin revealed soon, and\\or Nidalee and Ahri could be made available again. Yet in such a case accounting may be somewhat rushed and it doesn&#039;t seem fair for the teams that will make it to the MSI to not know how much they&#039;re competing for and what SKT\\SSG\\KT will win.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Eggo McLego","date":"2017-04-04T21:29:40.806+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there!

It looks amazing. I love the color red and I love Karma. If you guys throw in a dinosaur in this skin I may just die. I just noticed one small minor detail left out when you guys changed her particles. Her passive did not get a change of color as did all her other abilities. Which is a small detail but it be nice if that would change to red  yellow, black or even white to match the current theme. I also cant wait to see the splash art for this skin!!!
