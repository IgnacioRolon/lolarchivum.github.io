I have to restart my whole computer in order to get it to work again and this usually takes 6-10 minutes. My internet is never the problem, my router displays that nothing has happened to it plus everything else in the house does not disconnect, and the computer is about a month old. Is there something going wrong with the servers, or is it my computer/internet that has given me two leavers today?","replies":[{"poster":"GeneralAlboz","date":"2016-10-09T10:50:32.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I have the same issue on a PC with Ethernet cable. All started 2 weeks ago, when I did an update of my OS (I already had Windows 10 and I did an update that was available, the latest one for Win10). Since then it started to disconnect me from the Internet completely while playing, and  had to reset the PC altogether. Then I downloaded the latest drivers for my Network Card and seemed to be fixed. Last two days, though, I started to experience another issue: it keeps disconnecting me from the game and after several seconds it reconnects, and after a bit disconnects again and so on and so forth. (In particular, I noticed it starts to do this when big fights start, maybe it is completely random, but I noticed these). \nIs there a possible fix or have you got any ideas of what it could be?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-03T18:14:59.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It very well could be your network adapter as *Blazingflares* mentioned.
