I would then close the client, and open up the launcher again, which would tell me my game had been corrupted, and I had to reinstall LoL. I've gotten so many 20 minute low priority queues from this, and it's really frustrating now playing and hoping your game doesn't crash and corrupt itself.\r\n\r\nIf anyone can provide help, i'll be really grateful ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-19T20:23:43.697+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's hard to tell what might be causing your issue as it could to be a combination of connection and computer problems crashing your game.

I got some more, and now it runs fine. although it's unlikely that we have the same problem, it  might be related to the specs on your computer. Check your specs, and then check the recommended ones for league. This is probably not it, but it's good to be sure first.\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
