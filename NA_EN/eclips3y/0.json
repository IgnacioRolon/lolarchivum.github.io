Its also canceled by any CC.\n\nHe is a heavily anti AP champion, and APs aren't exceptionally popular. You run into a lot more full AD comps than you do 3-4 AP comps\n\nNo hard CC outside of ult and no mobility aside from a MS buff that requires you to sit still for a second. \n\nAnti AP champ (APs usually being burst) with a skill that counters a DPS.\n\nMostly everyone does what he does better except counter AP heavy comps, which aren't common. One of my friends had the pleasure of being last pick vs a 3 AP and a Corki team.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-04-02T04:03:03.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is the problem with the player base.

They make playing him really tedious for the first 6 -7 minutes.\n\nAnivia has that same problem. Both are very excellent champions once they finish athenes.\n\nHe certainly cant be bad, as he often ends up within the 10 highest winrates. He was specifcally they 2nd highest winrate champion for about 3 days after this recent patch, with nunu being on top.\n\nI think he is in the same boat as Urgot. Once a pro plays him, he will become very popular very quickly.\n\nEdit: With a standard build, Galio now has a 5 second 52% AoE movement speed boost on a 6 second cooldown, along with the rest of his kit. That's a pretty big deal. Tack that one with the athenes buffs... expect to see him in lcs.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-04-02T02:31:36.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Though full AD comps are probably more likely to happen than full AP comps, I think most of the overpowered/broken champions in the game (Katarina, Nidalee, Fizz) are AP and even then powerful AP champions that bully in lane like Vel'Koz, Xerath, Syndra, etc would just be useless against him and he could easily burst them down far before they burst him down.\n\nI think Galio deserves more spotlight than he is currently given. This might just be my bias as I am heavily biased towards overpowered \"freelo\" champions such as Katarina and I love seeing champions with actual skill-bases like Viktor (Who I currently main) become in the meta.\n\nGalio might just need a small buff, maybe giving him naturally +15 Magic Resistance or something (not +15 Armor because he isn't a Dragon.) so he has more of a natural tankiness towards AP champions and not be as item reliant for his passive.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Maximum Zilean","date":"2015-04-02T02:13:32.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ILoveTyranny,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=FX9OxJqn,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-04-02T01:48:31.913+0000)\n>\n> I don't know why people think Galio is so bad (not saying this thread implies it though).\n> \n> -Game changing ultimate\n> -Powerful poke\n> -Extremely powerful sustain\n> -Naturally counters pretty much every AP Mid Laner\n> \n> I've never played Galio but is there something I'm missing here besides that he's mana hungry and doesn't have #lc$bigplays?\n\nProblem is he's a niche pick.

The guy is a solid pick against AD and AP champions, in fact I would say he's built to deal with AD champs just as well as AP champs.  All he needs is a Spirit Visage and a Thornmail and his shield will regenerate so much health from AA's.  His ult is built to punish assassins and bruisers diving his carries, something that is easier for him to do than diving the enemy team's carries.  \n\nGalio's a solid champion.
