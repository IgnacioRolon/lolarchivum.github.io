Tanks don't do damage, and damage duelers are squisy. Bruisers offer the best of both worlds (how very Hannah Montana of them).

Think about it this way, if you're Camille and spend 60 - 90 seconds hitting a tank trying to kill them (cause lets be real its gonna take you that long). It will take the tank (it varies of course) prob 50 seconds to kill you by simply standing next to you with sunfire cape due to the relative health blocks. Its not the amt of damage a champ does that makes them hurt, its the amount of time it takes them to output that damage (if you're into cars its like torque vs horsepower).

Keeping the status quo will not work with bruisers. The best path would have been to introduce the new items, nerf the problematic champions, nerf the problematic champions the next patch after that, and then look into buffing weaker ones. Inaction is the worse option.\n\nIdk if we were being inactive (agree with you btw, we shouldn't sit still).
