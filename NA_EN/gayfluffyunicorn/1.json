If you stop making them as item-focused and make them more solo-skilled champions with their *kits* then we traditionally see them dominate solo lanes by themselves. It's very tough to design a support with a strong kit that doesn't go off and dominate by in a solo lane for the higher income. \n\nSupports have to operate on a lower income, and so if they have a successfully strong solo-skilled kit on low income, we see them be naturally better than solo laners that are balanced around having a solo-lane income.\n\nWe saw Tahm dominate jungle/top lane for awhile, Lulu is another great example as well.\n\nGenuinely curious as to your thoughts about this though.","replies":[{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2018-01-10T01:33:50.976+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup i know, i played during those times and the horror of toplane lulu.

They're gated by costs. To create influential items for supports, they naturally have to be less expensive.\n\nIf the stats/rewards are too high while the item is at support-level cost, other classes will abuse it.\nIf the stats/rewards are too low as a support-level cost, it's a poor item that wont be built\nIf the stats/rewards are good but cost is too high, you've just made another solo-lane item\nIf stats/rewards are good and price too low, it'll be another \"must have\" item that dominates the game\n\nSupports in general are just extremely difficult to balance because they function on such a low income. That's probably *why* they've been shoved into the item stackstick corner, because that's just (believe it or not) the least difficult/problematic approach they have.\n\nBasically: \nyou can't balance supports around they're kits because they'll turn into solo-lane monsters.\nyou can't provide a wide array of viable supports with items because they'll be abused by other classes\n\nIt's a bitch of a problem\n\nAlso, whoever is just downvoting me/upvoting Mr. Unicorn could really provide they're own perspective or really anything to this discussion. No one likes a voting-bot that functions purely on whichever comment sounds good or most closely resembles they're predisposed opinions.\n\nI value any worthwhile input, whether I agree with it not. Any new views/perspectives, or even a new approach to an already stated opinion to explain it better is *always* appreciated. I aim to discuss and stimulate thought, and a random vote doesn't help with anything is all","replies":[{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2018-01-10T13:31:44.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well i can't do more than ask for people to stop with it in my edit below my post i already saw that way before your comment. \nIf you want to know how ridiculous it can get look at my discussion with rubick. He gets downvoted, i agree with him and get upvoted. I have legit no idea where this comes from. \n\n\nThing is, is it that bad when support items get \"abused\"? \nBefore the tank rework i used to spam nautilus for a while toplane and after three items i usually bought locket and redemption on him to support my carries in teamfights even more. \nI actually got made fun of by player for doing this but i had 60% winrate on in, pretty good if you ask me. \n\nYeah i get it's difficult since the creativity is heavily limit by a lot of factors, still marksmen are already way too statchecky with few to no counterplay. Statchecks are always bad in this game. \nGive supports an item that gives enemies a brittle effect so CCs last longer. \nGive them maybe their own version of a zzrot?\nI dunno i think there are still a lot of options to emplore. An item that only affects melee allies? Like sejuanis passive. \nAll i want to prevent is another ardent meta in the end a nerf to marksmen to open up the support role. Imo one reason why noone plays it is because they ARE dependent on their adc and while it will never be completely independent of each other right now it's more a life and death situation.","replies":[{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2018-01-10T16:46:52.120+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really wouldn't say things like Locket or Redemption are \"abused\" so to speak. They're definitely viable for other classes, but not 100% the most efficient in most situations. I honestly can't think of any cases of support items being abused, but there are several examples outside of the support class where items have been abused. Black Cleaver, pretty much all Lethality items, etc. So while we don't really have any good examples for support items to this date, I wouldn't necessarily say it isn't possible. It's just something to be careful of if/when we do see a support item rehaul, as I do think cases of item abusement is a real threat with this approach.\n\nAlthough, this is definitely an avenue of balance that I would like to see explored. Like I said before, I was just playing the devil's advocate because I honestly didn't know where the conversation would go.\n\nOverall, I think we can conclude that your idea is at least worth exploring. It brings a different set of risks then the current method of reducing supports to adc stat-sticks, but the potential reward could also be much more enjoyable than currently.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ChuShoe","date":"2018-01-10T08:40:13.021+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"small question...\nWhat was the DynQ disaster?","replies":[{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2018-01-10T13:39:05.781+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since people leave out half what actually happened: \nRiot promised a pure soloQ we have been asking for  ages 2 weeks after the release of DynQ to see if DynQ actually works and such.\n\nWelp for a few months complete silence on the topic hundreds over hundreds of posts ignored and no soloQ in sight.
