PLUS his cooldowns are HUGE\r\nI also want to take a quick look at another champion we have in league his name is Yorick HOLD ON Yorick and Mordekaiser aren't the same person.

His playrate and winrate have skyrocketed and his design now better fits in the grand scheme of League.\n\nEdit: And this is also coming from someone with M5 on Morde (pre-rework.) So while I'm not a super diehard fan or anything, after my 40-50+ games I definitely prefer the new Morde. ","replies":[]}]}
