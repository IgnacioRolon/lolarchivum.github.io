They have good relationships with them.

So then yes, it's very possible that originally-jungle-grown tomatoes could have found their way to Demacia legally.

Concept art definitely seems to show a big emphasis on rice farming. And rice flour...is not the most ideal for making a pizza dough. Rice can be very fickle. Take it from someone who was recently doing a job making fat sandwich wraps in rice wraps. They would always rip!\n\nHowever, perhaps there are the Runeterran equivalent of naan pizzas around the places where Karma (and possibly Jhin) come from? But then again, they'd have to have access to jungle-grown tomatoes to make a proper pizza. Ionia is likely also not that big on cheese or dairy, except, again, for the places that correspond to India in our world (do we have an exact location for that in Ionia, even Karma's hometown?)","replies":[]}]}]}
