However it's completely random as to which ones they get **(Lootboxes)** and just feels bad when you want to get that Sugar Cone Furyhorn , but you end up getting multiples of the Demacian Silverwing.\n\nMy Idea revolves around the Blue Essence Emporium, What if:\n_**For say 25k or 50k Blue Essence, you could buy a Lil' Legends Token (Limited to 1). Lil' Legend Tokens can be redeemed in Hextech Crafting to unlock a Level 1 Lil' Legend of your choosing.**_\n\nThe Token would be available in the Blue Essence Emporium for 25k-50k Blue Essence (Price subject to change), but you can only buy one token per Emporium. This way you players can get the Legend that they want and if a New Lil Legend is released sometime down the line that you like, you can pick it up.","replies":[{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-08-30T17:19:54.518+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like something of this nature, though I don't think BE is the way to do it.  BE comes from normal league, and doesn't reflect your work with TFT.  They would have to introduce a new form of TFT currency, and use it to buy things like maps and LL.  Perhaps they're thinking of something like that in the future, but for right now we just get the beta pass line.  I assume they won't continue with the beta pass past beta.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dying In Vayne","date":"2019-08-30T03:03:53.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Little Legends are the most redundant cosmetic in the entirety of league. Tier 3 legends are designed so that children that desire such skins put money into the game. It was a smart business strategy by riot.\n\nIf you want a specific legend; be willing to spend money.","replies":[]}]}
