Upon getting attacked, the champion will display a small reticle, letting me know that if I were to land my W, they&#039;d get rooted. \r\n\r\nNow, with this particular skin; I haven&#039;t noticed this in Jhin&#039;s Classic Skin or the most recent Blood Moon skin; the reticle doesn&#039;t always tell the truth. The reticle can occasionally stay for a bit too long, leading the player (me) to believe that they&#039;ll get rooted if I land my W. I&#039;ve named it the &quot;Ghost Reticle&quot;.  There have been even rarer occasions when the reticle would stay for a large part of the game&#039;s length! So please do look into this. I do like this skin, and that bug is the main reason I don&#039;t play it as much. \r\n\r\nThanks in Advance,\r\nSonder One","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-03-27T17:36:11.816+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! ^-^ \n\nThanks for the detailed report. Lemme dig into this a bit today and see what's causing the particle to improperly display. This is the first report I've seen on the issue, which leads me to believe that it's skin-specific, but we'll do a sweep across the board, just to be sure.","replies":[]}]}
