I click to move then quickly click on a minion and my champion follows my movement all the way through then turns to auto attack. Sometimes it doesn't even attack the minion. Just last game I played, I click on a minion and it made me go into bush then auto a different minion. Does anyone know how I can get rid of this? Anyone else have this problem?","replies":[{"poster":"RealsoSorry","date":"2016-11-10T07:03:41.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here...
