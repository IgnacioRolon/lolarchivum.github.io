And knowing that alone puts you on a even bigger tilt. And then when that happens, people tend to comment  &quot;lol you got boosted&quot; &quot;wow you&#039;re [rank] and terrible&quot; &quot;worst [rank] I&#039;ve seen&quot; which really doesn&#039;t help much. I went on a losing streak and ended up in a lower division than what my border tells, or maybe I&quot;m having a bad day/game. Don&#039;t need to be a douchebag about it.\r\n\r\nSo what do you do to try and keep a leveled head?\r\n\r\nPlay normals for a bit? Rant to friends? Or just say fuck it and keep playing ranked (which is a bad idea by the way, don&#039;t play when you&#039;re tilted it usually never ends well).","replies":[]}
