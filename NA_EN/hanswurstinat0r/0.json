Altough I can hear the music, the client stays black. I can enter my username and password because of the sound of the \"tab\" button, but if i press enter, only the music stops, the client remains black and nothing other changes. I've been having this problem since i update the new client. I fixed it last patch by just deactivating one of my graphics cards (I play on a laptop with 2 graphics cards), this worked perfectly until the patch that appeared today. Now i have the exact same problem again. (I'm running Windows 10 btw.)\r\n\r\nThings that I've tried:\r\n- Reinstalling the client\r\n- Reinstalling the Adobe Flash Player\r\n- Use the \"Repair\" tool\r\n- Run LeagueClient directly from C:/Riot Games/League of Legends\r\n- Launch as administrator\r\n- Changing the compatibility settings\r\n- Launching with no sandbox parameter\r\n- Updating my graphiccards\r\n- Reactivating my second graphics card for League of Legends (the one i deactivatet last patch)\r\n\r\nAlso this is written in my debug file: \r\n[1122/194548:ERROR:gpu_video_decode_accelerator.cc(375)] HW video decode not available for profile 11\r\n\r\nSearching for the answer has been very{{summoner:3}} ing, it would be really nice if someone could {{summoner:7}} my League of Legends.\r\n\r\n{{champion:14}} ara","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-23T23:20:25.748+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This could be caused by any number of different factors.

Since that quick change didn't resolve this issue, it's likely not related to the last issue you had.
