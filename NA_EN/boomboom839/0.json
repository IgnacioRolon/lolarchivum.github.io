They've been known to cause crashes so I recommend removing them as a first step.  When you crash, what is happening exactly and are you getting any errors?  You can also return to the legacy client during the testing period if you don't want to test:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nLet me know!","replies":[{"poster":"BOOMBOOM839","date":"2017-01-06T20:34:25.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it happens alot and mostly for a while it hasn't crashed BUT another bug I have been having is that when it takes a long time to load into a game I can't leave the fountain at all.
