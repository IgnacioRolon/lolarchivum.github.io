My league lag report looks like this..\r\n\r\nhttps://ibb.co/jP5RXm\r\n\r\n10% packet loss. It&#039;s really bad, and gets worse at night when the network gets congested (I live at college).\r\n\r\nSo the tech support called this morning. Of course when I mentioned not being able to play games, and it&#039;s packet loss issues, her response was &quot;probably the game servers&quot;.....\r\n\r\nSo we do a ping test. One of those slow ping tests through the command prompt, so that she can prove to me  it isn&#039;t packet loss and tell me my network is fine. For one, it&#039;s morning when the traffic isn&#039;t as bad, for two it&#039;s a slow ping test, and not nearly pinging as fast as any game would need to.\r\n\r\nit&#039;s frustrating.... I&#039;m trying to get them to send someone out to fix this bull but they have to &quot;prove&quot; it isn&#039;t working properly before they do. Really? I&#039;ve lived here years without calling you guys, never changed my setup. uhgggggggggggggg\r\n\r\nNot being able to play ANY games during my last semester at college is so sucky........ not sure what to tell charter to get them out here and fix it. It&#039;s like they don&#039;t freaking believe anything you say, because I&#039;m just some retarded college kid. \r\n\r\n/rant","replies":[]}
