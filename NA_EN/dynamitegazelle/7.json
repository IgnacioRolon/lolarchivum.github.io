All it does is limit itemization, and for mages there are a lot of cdr options, but now Ryze won&#039;t want to buy any CDR items at all.\n\nWhen I build 40% CDR on my champ from pure itemization (or masteries or runes), it makes me feel powerful because I chose this specific itemization route, which may have certain strengths and weaknesses compared to a \"normal\" build.\n\nBut when i get CDR for no reason from a champions kit, i just think \"whelp, i guess this is just how the champion is meant to be played,&#039; rather than feeling like I&#039;m gaming the system to make my champion more powerful. Free CDR just gives me one less build path to experiment with.\n\n\nYeah, the previous Ryze had built in CDR, but it was only 10% and it was meant to add flavour in line with his backstory. 10% is also not a problem because it still makes alternative build paths worthwhile.\n\n30% though?

With Blue Buff and a high mana pool, Cass can throw out E's all the time and she will eventually reach 40% CDR without items (with Blue). Or she can grab a WotA or SV to cap her CDR while giving her more self heal. I think it's nice to see a champion that doesn't use a cookie cutter AP mage build. I think she has more options than other AP mages. \n\nIf anything, giving Ryze massive CDR for free actually frees up his itemization choices. It used to be FH or bust on Ryze because he NEEDED that 20% CDR. Now he doesn't have to build FH so he can build Randuin's or Thornmail or GA as armor choices without having to worry about NOT having Frozen Heart. Of course, Ryze will lose a small amount of damage from the 400 mana but he should gain more effective health with this change. \n\nI think certain champs benefit more from CDR and other do not. For example, {{champion:50}} doesn't typically build CDR nor does he really need it. On the other hand {{champion:8}} benefits heavily from CDR and tries to incorporate as much as possible into his build. Many midlane mages who use mana will buy {{item:3174}} or {{item:3165}} to support their mana consumption while benefiting from the 20% CDR. For champions that spam abilities more often, {{item:3070}} and {{item:3027}} become more core because mana regen cannot support the amount of mana they are using for their abilities that are coming out every second.

Before, you had a distinct core build that could not be changed in any way with Rod of Ages, Seraph's Embrace, cap at 40% CDR with Frozen Heart, plus boots and a couple other items to round out the build.
