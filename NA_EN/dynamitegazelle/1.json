Doesn&#039;t make any sense because ghost bride and victorious got to keep their original q animations. And the on hit animation is soooooooo weak compared to the amazing original.\r\n\r\nThe W is again mostly a recolor of the base but with some vines around the edge. It&#039;s not terrible, but the original had some interesting motion to it while the new one is completely static. The old one had a really awesome effect at the end where pieces of the pool flew away, but the new one just disappears with no effects. How is that an upgrade?\r\n\r\nThe E shield is probably the only ability that is improved through a new color scheme. Also by making the shield smaller it&#039;s easier to see the swirling leaves which is nice.\r\n\r\nThe new Ult adds features vines between the the player and the opponents. At first I though &#039;ok that&#039;s kinda interesting&#039;, but then I went back and looked at the original and just thought &#039;why?&#039; The original is possibly one of the coolest ult animations in the game and now it&#039;s just a fraction of what it used to be.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t understand why they needed to make these changes. Of course the old shield and pool definitely could have used an upgrade, but at least for the pool they should just have just changed the middle and kept the border and finishing effects. The ult and the q are huge downgrades and there was no real reason to even do anything to them. Why?\r\n\r\nCheck the vids to compare for yourself:\r\n\r\nUpdated: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1N5lJzeWJY\r\n\r\nOriginal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLl-ZECfpDE","replies":[{"poster":"Krigjer","date":"2015-03-30T22:11:47.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The PBE post I read said that the q was a work in progress and still needed the visuals added.","replies":[{"poster":"DynamiteGazelle","date":"2015-03-30T22:17:24.044+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I heard they might add some leaves or something, but that doesn't change the fact that it's just a recolor of the base.","replies":[{"poster":"Krigjer","date":"2015-03-30T22:23:27.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DynamiteGazelle,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=7AhM3Irg,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-03-30T22:17:24.044+0000)\n>\n> Yeah, I heard they might add some leaves or something, but that doesn't change the fact that it's just a recolor of the base.\n\nhttp://www.surrenderat20.net/2015/03/330-pbe-update.html\n\nThey added leaves apparently.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TeemoJenkins","date":"2015-03-30T22:16:58.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would just like to say the skin itself looks fabulous compared to what it was.","replies":[{"poster":"DynamiteGazelle","date":"2015-03-30T22:20:35.536+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah they lightened up the color of the wood which makes it easier to make out.
