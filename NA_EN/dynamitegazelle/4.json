Riot's logic.

Literally every part. Her W, her R, and her Q have all received nerfs since her rework, but her E has never been nerfed despite the fact that it was her burst potential. lol. \n\nNow, what's really made her OP is the fact that they did buff her Q's damage to do 55% of her AP while on a 1.5s cd. With a tiny bit of CDR and it may as well be Cass's E. lol. So, her burst is about 130% of her AP instantly, then constant DPS from her Q. The buff to her Q was after the change of her E to physical, sort of a compensation. It's just silly. They always overload her kit with silly things.
