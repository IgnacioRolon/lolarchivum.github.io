The Jinx and Poppy skins have a lot more unique particle effects so I suppose you can justify their prices, but the Draven one is way more simple than they are. Santa Draven doesn&#039;t even have a homeguard animation while the other 2 do. So less overall particles and animations, and no new VO or voice processing, just some sparkly chime sounds. Not worth 1350 if you ask me.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2017-11-21T23:43:07.047+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":3,"body":"They are just really deep into these 1350s lately :/  It's like almost all we've had this year was 1350 and above.
