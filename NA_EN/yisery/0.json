Especially because they are only shown if you view *your* profile page, which otherwise looks identical to any other profile page.\r\nInstead, these should go next to the IP and RP counters.\r\n\r\nThe champion background is a nice idea, but the underlying algorithm is very inconsistent to the point where I don&#039;t get it at all. It would be better if it was user-configurable.\r\n\r\n# Collection\r\n\r\nInformation about champion chests is missing. It would be nice if I could even sort the champion list by that so I don&#039;t have to rely on external sites or a custom text file in order to find out which champions I have owned chests for already.\r\n\r\nTalking about sorting, the sort order radio buttons for the champions page seems kinda slapped onto it since it has no explanation around it, unlike in the store where the up and down arrows (&uarr;&darr;) provide more context.\r\n\r\nChampion details pages have the champions&#039; lore also kinda sticked onto it. The text is very small and the text area as well, meaning you still have to scroll a lot. I suggest adding a separate &quot;Lore&quot; tab, like there was previously, next to the Skins one.\r\n\r\nThe other collection pages (masteries, runes, spells) are great though. And the champion detail pages, too (abilities tab best tab).\r\n\r\n# Responsiveness\r\n\r\nThe hover delay of 1s (?) is too high. It makes the client feel very unresponsive. Instead, it should be lowered to 300-400ms.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*What do you think?*","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-09-29T17:01:47.379+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Responsiveness is definitely something we are not completely happy with.

Because the first time I click on it after launching the client it takes almost 2-3 seconds before I'm actually shown the lobby page. Which is unacceptable since it's such a paramount section and it doesn't actually show a \"loading\" progress bar.\n\nYou should probably, if possible, add the whole lobby page to be cached during the login procedure to the client.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RetroSplurge","date":"2016-10-04T18:39:56.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only responsiveness issue I have is when I hover over runes and masteries.
