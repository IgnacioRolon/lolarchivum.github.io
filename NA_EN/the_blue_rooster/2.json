I think it's essential calling your position when you play champs like Nidalee, Zed, Quinn, Maokai, Malphite, and Yasuo (to name a few) who can play Mid/Top/Jungle. This is confusing because sometimes you get two people who choose without communicating and then you get two people who readied up for mid lane and one is forced top vs their counter.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CoolKnightST","date":"2015-03-24T15:46:33.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if whe make syntax agreament:\n\n* \"^ Prefer this role\"\n* \"= Can play this role\"\n* \"~ Don't prefer this role\" \n\n**Example**\n\n* ^top^mid^jungle^adc^support\n* =top=mid=jungle^adc^support\n* -top^mid^jungle~adc~support\n* ^support^adc ==~top","replies":[{"poster":"DreadPirateChris","date":"2015-03-25T07:02:49.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CoolKnightST,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BcMlbT5G,comment-id=0018,timestamp=2015-03-24T15:46:33.879+0000)\n>\n> What if whe make syntax agreament:\n> \n> * \"^ Prefer this role\"\n> * \"= Can play this role\"\n> * \"~ Don't prefer this role\" \n> \n> **Example**\n> \n> * ^top^mid^jungle^adc^support\n> * =top=mid=jungle^adc^support\n> * -top^mid^jungle~adc~support\n> * ^support^adc ==~top\n\nUm. I usually say 'adc > support > fill pref' meaning 'adc more than support more than fill pref'\nPeople seem to understand this because it's pretty natural parsing. Nobody will naturally understand ^=~ .... they don't have good natural parsing. If you read '^adc=support~jungle' out loud you get 'carat adc equals support tilde jungle' .... what does that tell you? If you read 'adc > support > jungle' you get 'adc more than support more than jungle'. What does -that- tell you?\n\n(Also this totally doesn't address the OP's problem. His problem is people not calling roles at all, not the syntax with which they call them.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"bad arcade kitty","date":"2015-03-24T22:29:25.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CoolKnightST,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BcMlbT5G,comment-id=0018,timestamp=2015-03-24T15:46:33.879+0000)\n>\n> What if whe make syntax agreament:\n> \n> * \"^ Prefer this role\"\n> * \"= Can play this role\"\n> * \"~ Don't prefer this role\" \n> \n> **Example**\n> \n> * ^top^mid^jungle^adc^support\n> * =top=mid=jungle^adc^support\n> * -top^mid^jungle~adc~support\n> * ^support^adc ==~top\n\ni won't remember and cannot parse all this regexp","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"43161549_DEL","date":"2015-03-24T23:13:50.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely agree with you.
