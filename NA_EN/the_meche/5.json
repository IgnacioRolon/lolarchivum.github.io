Otherwise he's just a blitzcrank with more peel. Voli is a bruiser. Bard isn't a jungler, he's a regular support.\n\nNow when you look at Ivern what do you see?

There are barely any games played in the 5-15 games range, so a single win causes a big change in win rate. Couple lost elo with skill from learning and you have a spike that falls off. I know those two factors at least are going on.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2016-11-02T19:49:02.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"because hes not?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drakylon","date":"2016-11-02T19:58:00.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bard was buffed significantly before he became even viable. Not sure about Taliyah; I think that was because no one knew how to use her W before it got changed to vector cast (which ironically made it weaker).\n\nAs for Ivern, give him some time. If you paid any attention to op.gg's stats, you'll notice that his 40% win rate is diluted by a terrible win rate in an off-role (support). His jungle win rate is 46.77%, which is rather low but at least acceptable for a champion that was just released this patch. Champion.gg cites a 48.14% win rate for his jungle (and an abysmal 26.19% win rate for support) with an average games played of 4.14, which is pretty good for a champion so complex on the macro level that it changes the way players play the game.","replies":[]}]}
