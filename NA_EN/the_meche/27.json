It&#039;s one of the most noob friendly roles since you have a pal to share the burden with.\nFree heals, stuns, wards, etc. It&#039;s the lane of second chances. The lane of handicaps. It&#039;s the lane you duo in with your friend who sucks because you know you can take care of them or because you know you can use them as a handicap.\n\nADC should be either 4th or 3rd hardest role with support being 5th obviously. I keep flip flopping between 4th and 3rd because jungle only really requires textbook knowledge to play. You don&#039;t really need mechanics for the jungle. You just have to be smart and know where to be. Once you have that down through a bit of studying, you&#039;re set.\n\nTop and mid are the only real lanes where there&#039;s some difficulty. Moreso top than mid for obvious reasons.","replies":[]}
