At least in silver where I am, Riven loses 90% of the time whether I&#039;m playing her, someone else on my team, or someone on the enemy team (that part is my fav because it&#039;s pretty much a free win).\n\nShe dies in a quarter of a second. Sure, she has a shield, but what good is a shield when you lose all your HP in one spell?\n\nSo I thought: Hmmm, that's weird, what's going here? Then I saw her HP pool and she only has like 1.4k hp late game as a melee champion.\n\nWTF","replies":[]}
