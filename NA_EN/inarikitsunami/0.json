I was playing ARAM as Syndra and after I'd respawned and was leaving the alter (I forget if I used any spells or w/e), I was suddenly under the map textures. I could kinda move around, but it was really jerky and everything. I figured it was just my toaster, esp since it fixed itself after a minutes / I used some abilities. Happened too long ago for me to remember if I was wearing a skin or not.
