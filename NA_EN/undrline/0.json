I'm having an issue with understanding role consistency:\n\n* The choices of roles are top/mid/bot/jg/supp/fill during draft\n\n* The choices of roles are assassin/fighter/mage/marksman/support/tank in my collection champ filter and the store filter, and the champ pick filter icon buttons\n\n* The ability wheel shows a spectrum of damage/toughness/cc/mobility/utility\n\nAutofill says I'm assured my pick of role because I recently played or filled support.  I'm guessing that goes for anyone who plays support, no matter how they queued, just to offset the tendency for ppl in games to play dps roles.  But, what exactly does the game consider support?\n\nFrom blind queuing, players seem to consider bot supp to be tanks and healers (a never specifically mentioned role), and also champs with high utility or crowd control.\n\nAnd, then there's jungle.  It seems that, technically, any champ can do it, but only certain ones are actually suited for it.  What does the game consider a jungler?  I suppose  the game doesn't care what champ I use when I pick that role in draft, and just cares that someone has pledged themselves to do that task.\n\nI guess my real concern is if one of the champs that I'm experienced with gets banned and that's the only champ I have that can play the role I signed up for, or for which I've built my rune sheet.  I can't filter the champs I own and figure out which is a jungler, I have to look through online guides.  That's kinda difficult with a timer counting down during a draft pick.\n\nApologies if this has been discussed before.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-07-17T02:07:51.584+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The \"inconsistencies\" are because you are actually mixing two different things: **Role** and **Position**. I agree that it's a bit counter-intuitive to get filters by Role during champion picks ---and not by Position, since you signed to fill a Position, not a Role---, but what's important is what you will provide to your team, what Role you'll take, so that's the filters you get.\n\n**Role** is what your champion do, what's their job in the team, what tasks they have to accomplish for your team to reach victory.\n\n* Tank: protect the team, CC and disable enemies, be the frontline and take damage for your allies.\n* Mage: deal damage and CC enemies from range. Actual range and damage patterns vary quite a lot depending on the specific type of Mage. _(Don't hesitate to ask me more details if you want.)_\n* Assassin: find or create a good opportunity, go in, kill a priority target as fast as possible, and ideally go out without dying yourself.\n* Support*: I think the best way to put it would be \"Mages without damage\". You're supposed to assist your team by empowering your allies, protecting them with your spells and/or disabling your opponents with CC. You usually work from range and you're squishy, like Mages.\n* Marksfolk/ADC: provide safe and consistent, sustained damage from range (a.k.a. DPS, for Damage Per Second). So you're the best to kill Tanks and objectives such as Dragon or Towers.\n* Fighter: I kept this one for the end because it's a mixed bag with a bit of everything: damage, durability, CC/mobility. But they excel at nothing. They have less damage than ADC, less durability than Tanks, less CC Supports, etc. Depending on the exact kind of Fighter, this can vary A LOT, from someone un-peelable like Vi to someone very easy to kite but very hard to kill like Garen.\n\n######*(I really don't like this name, because it's also used for a Position, but I have nothing better.)\n\nWhat you call \"role selection during draft\" is in fact the **Position** you take on the map, and it only means one very simple thing: what Gold you get. Top/Mid/Bot get the Gold from minions on their respective lane. Jungle gets neutral monsters from the Jungle, and Support gets no Gold at all (and so should buy items that generate Gold instead).\n___\n\nRole and Position are not totally disconnected, there are some \"customs\" and habits, but each Position can be filled by multiple Roles. Of course, exceptions apply, but here is the most common repartition.\n\n* Tank: Top, Jungle, Support-pos.\n* Mage: mostly Mid, Support-pos, sometimes Top or Jungle, rarely Bot.\n* Assassin: Mid or Jungle, rarely Top.\n* Support-role: mostly Support-position (hence the confusion between the two terms), but sometimes Jungle (mostly Nunu and Ivern)\n* Marksfolk/ADC: mostly Bot, with some select few going into every other Position (Kindred or Graves in Jungle, Varus or Corky Mid, Vayne or Quinn Top, MF or Ashe Support, for instance)\n* Fighter: Top, Jungle, and rarely Mid.\n\nand the other way around...\n\n* Top: mostly Tank and Fighters, sometime a couple Mages.\n* Jungle: mostly Tank and Fighters, with a few Assassins or even Mages making an appearance.\n* Mid: mostly Mages and Assassins, with a select few Fighters or Tanks chosen as counter-picks once in a while.\n* Bot: mostly ADC, with a few exceptions once in a while.\n* Support-position: Support-role (obviously), Tank, some Mages.\n\nYou can also note that there is more than five Roles, so obviously you don't need to fill each Role to have a good team. Some champs can also fill multiple Roles depending on what they build exactly. Jarvan IV for instance is usually a Tank or Fighter but is sometimes built as an Assassin. Just to give you a rough idea, try to get 1-2 champs with reliable/hard CC, 1-3 champs that are durable enough to stay in the thick of the fight (these two can overlap, if you play a Tank for instance), and 1 ADC, and fill the rest how you like. Don't worry if you can't get that, though, that's just the ideal situation, but you can definitely win games even if it's not the case.","replies":[{"poster":"undrline","date":"2017-07-18T15:24:23.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I really like your breakdown and explanation, and it fits with everything I've read, watched, and seen in game, it very much goes to show how much the ingame messaging is lacking for newer players.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-07-18T16:31:09.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LoL is an horribly complex game with a high barrier to entry.

The roles like fighter and bruiser typically line up with top lane, whereas mages can most likely be found in mid (depending on what type of mage they are). \n\nIf you're wondering about some of the finer points of role selection and where certain champs are played best, I'd suggest reaching out to the rest of the community over on the [**Gameplay Board**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance)!","replies":[{"poster":"undrline","date":"2017-07-17T13:37:59.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the comment.  I realized after I posted that I had done so in \"Help & Support\" but it would be better in \"Gameplay.\"\n\nA large part of my post is criticism.  The labels Riot uses are incredibly inconsistent and leave open questions.  And, for a new player who's not reading outside guides and consulting the community, I'm sure it's met with utter confusion.  Assassin, tank, mage are fine as categories, and I understand the need not to pigeon-hole a champ, but there needs to be better on-screen communication as to what position a champ _usually_ plays.  I've read guides, and I still have questions.  I still have to look up \"so what role is this champ, really.\"","replies":[]}]}]}
