You get some even if you lose. The other thing is that they will drop togrther (no more 1 keyfrag at a time, more likely 2 or 3). The last thing is that you can get them anywhere not only in the after game screen. You can still get keys in the end game screen but you can get them on login or while shoping, too. \n\nI hoped that answered your questions and if so please let me know. If you have any other questions I will be happy to answer them. And remember, whatever you do, do it honorably.","replies":[{"poster":"TacticalRice","date":"2017-07-11T12:35:13.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Asamas,realm=EUNE,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=5kWINW0E,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-07-11T11:48:39.989+0000)\n>\n> Hello there.
