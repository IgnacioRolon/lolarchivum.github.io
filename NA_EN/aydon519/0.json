Everything seemed normal, but after 5 minutes of chucking spears as Nidalee everything suddenly froze, then my computer shut down and rebooted.  At first i thought this way because my computer had recently wanted to update software, but i had ignored it.  Maybe it had tried to update without my realizing it and then it automatically restarted.  Annoying, possibly my mistake, but a one time thing nevertheless.\r\n\r\nHowever, after waiting for the boot up process and loading screen, i was back in the game.  My team was obviously behind, with only nexus turrets left.  I was in game for maybe three minutes before everything suddenly crashed once again.\r\n\r\nMy computer has been running smoothly for about an hour now, and no crash, so this has to do with the league of legends client, not the computer.\r\n\r\nJust hoping this will get fixed and curious if anyone else is having this problem.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2013-09-30T23:45:05.422+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Aydon519!\n\nSorry to hear about your issue with your Mac!  After reading through your explanation, this strongly suggests that your computer overheated.  When computers overheat, there are typically safeguard mechanisms in place that will force the computer to turn off and therefore \"cool off\" in order to ensure that no hardware is damaged.  Although, this can also be indicative of other hardware issues.\n\nIn order to rule out your computer overheating as a possible root cause, make sure to run a Furmark test.  This test is used to put high stress on your graphics card to see if any parts are malfunctioning.  You can find this here:\n\nhttp://download1us.softpedia.com/dl/eefd25d43c8966683e3c57b8065ced9d/4f5ebfe5/100102854/software/system/bench/FurMark_1.9.2.exe\n\nMake sure to run the test for about 10 to 20 minutes, and let me know what the end Temperature was at the end of the test!","replies":[]}]}
