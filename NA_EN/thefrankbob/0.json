There was a thick layer of fog all over the map.\r\nWhen I asked the guys I was playing with they said they couldn&#039;t see it, even with identical video settings.\r\nThe visuals were pretty awesome actually, really added to the spooky forest theme of the map, but that I was the only one that could see it struck me as odd.\r\n\r\nSo my questions: Is this a new randomly applying effect in Twisted Treeline, or a random bug.","replies":[{"poster":"MANWOLFAXEBOSS","date":"2015-06-13T01:10:49.930+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely a bug @_@ but it does look kinda cool\n\nPretty sure your Fog just completely failed to load. The blue is all missing textures (restart fixes it normally).","replies":[{"poster":"Blackquill","date":"2015-06-13T17:48:53.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is not a bug, it is a feature! :D","replies":[{"poster":"B Monkee","date":"2015-06-16T19:06:20.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glitch*","replies":[]}]}]}]}
