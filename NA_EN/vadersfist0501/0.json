Upon pressing continue, nothing occurred. Then, the game froze; though I was able to scan over minions and view their stats, they had stopped moving entirely. I was forced to exit, which resulted in a ban. Obviously, being banned for being forced to quit a game with all bots was bad enough, but the game freezing really confused me. :|\r\nAnyone have an idea what is going on?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-27T21:41:37.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea that sounds pretty odd tbh. I'm looking at your account now, and I'm not seeing any current or past bans on this one. Was this in reference to a different account?","replies":[]}]}
