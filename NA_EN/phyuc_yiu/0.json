I know Riot wants to make money and a good way to do that is to release broken champs that people rush to buy. Kayn has been no exception. I have not paid 1c to play LoL. Ever. I would if it wasn&#039;t so obvious what the business model is. Balance is an issue in the game and Riot does attempt to address it; even successfully when they want to. So some feedback from someone you aren&#039;t getting money from Riot, is to correct this. Balance is the most annoying aspect of this game (secondarily is the reward for kills as opposed to damage which encourages people to last hit rather than cooperate) and it doesn&#039;t help when Riot deliberately introduced imbalance to make money. I refuse to support such a game with money. I suspect I&#039;m not alone.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-07-21T04:55:25.645+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kayn is not even broken.

Look at the last two patches as a perfect example. Buff Cho'Gath then oh my we overcooked that, dial it back. If Riot have all these metrics and stats as you say then how could they make such an error in the first place? \n\nPlayers are very much a part of it. But as I stated in my original post, ALOT of people, including alot of scrubs are jumping on the bandwagon. These players make Kayn look bad, whereas other good players, who are fewer in number who can wipe the floor with Kayn, are insufficient to impact statistics. \n\nFact is we still have other champs like Yas which are broken yet Riot are incapable of balancing them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jayce Top","date":"2017-07-27T06:26:13.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kayn is trash right now lol.
