It takes like 5 or 6 times of restarting my client to actually reconnect. I saw on the old post that you would just go into the game file and delete something, but with the newer client there is no game file on my computer. Also if I ever accidentally ALT + Tab, it instantly bugsplats me again. This is a really big issue for me and would really appreciate it if someone can help me fix it or riot actually fixes it themselves. Either way I do not care, just would like to play the game without a problem every single game...

You could be having bad game files or drivers causing these bugsplats, so it's really important to go over each step of the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to fix this up.  Test it in a custom game, and let me know how it goes.","replies":[]}]}
