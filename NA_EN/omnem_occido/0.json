Garen is one such champion.\r\nIn higher ELOs, he&rsquo;s absolute trash, and in lower ELOs, he teaches bad mechanics by allowing players to take advantage of people who make positioning and kiting mistakes, possibly the most common mistake made by lower ELO players, while reinforcing this &quot;facecheck the enemy team while E is up&quot; mentality.\r\n\r\nHe&rsquo;s just a bad champion with dated abilities who desperately needs a rework. So here goes nothing.\r\n\r\n**Innate: A Worthy Opponent**- For each second Garen is in combat with an enemy champion, he gains a stack of **Determination**, lasting for four seconds once out of combat, stacking up to 8 times. Each stack causes 5.25% of all damage Garen deals to be dealt as True Damage and grants Garen 3.75% slow resistance.\r\n\r\n**Q: Righteous Fury**- Garen swings a mighty blow, dealing (40, 60, 80, 100, 120)(+50% AD) physical damage in a half circle in front of him and stunning enemies his for 1 second. His next basic attack deals (60, 80, 100, 120, 140)(+120% AD) physical damage.\r\n\r\n&gt; Cost: None \r\nCooldown: (8, 7.5, 7, 6.5, 6) seconds\r\nAbility Type: AoE, Basic Attack Modifier\r\nWindup: 0.75 seconds\r\nAoE Radius: 300\r\n\r\n**W: For the King!**- **Passive**: Whenever Garen kills an enemy unit, he gains +0.3 Armor and Magic Resist.\r\n**Active**- Garen charges forward, increasing his movement speed by (20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%) for 4 seconds. Enemies within a certain distance away from Garen moving away from him are slowed by (20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%) during this duration.\r\n\r\n&gt; Cost: None\r\nCooldown: (15, 14, 13, 12, 11)\r\nAbility Type: Self Buff\r\nRadius: 550\r\n\r\n**E: Decisive Strike-** Garen swings his sword with blistering speed, sending a shockwave in front of him that deals (60, 90, 120, 150, 180)(+100% AD) physical damage to enemies hit and silences them for (1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.5) seconds. This ability deals 50% bonus damage to enemies hit by his sword.\r\n\r\n**R: Judgement**- **Passive**- Garen&rsquo;s attacks and abilities that hit an enemy champion grant him heath regen per 5 seconds equal to 1.875% of his missing health per stack of **Determination**, lasting 5 seconds. Subsequent attacks and abilities reset this duration.\r\n**Active**- Garen marks the targeted enemy champion as **Villain**. For the next 4 seconds, Garen gains +25% movement speed while moving towards the **Villain**, and deals 15% bonus damage to that champion. At the end of this duration, Garen brings judgement down upon the unit, dealing (100, 200, 300) plus 35% of the target&rsquo;s missing health as physical damage.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis version of Garen is designed to give him some measure of range and retain some of his  unique characteristics, while also filling out his identity as a Juggernaut. His innate makes him much more deadly as the fight continues, a standard for the subclass. Because of the removal of the old **Judgement** and the rethinking of **Decisive Strike**, he relies more on his auto attacks for damage, and his new **E: Decisive Strike** allows him to input a small measure of utility while remaining at safe enough distance for a tank. Lastly, his ult is now designed to have some measure of counterplay. If you are low on health with no resources, it&rsquo;s a death sentence still, but with a clearly defined &ldquo;Do or Die&rdquo; moment, it allows the player the opportunity to pop a last second **Barrier** or any other shield/heal. In return, Garen gains the ability to single out a target and be stronger against/more sticky to that champion.\r\n\r\nThese are honestly just some of the thoughts I had, and I understand that I may have him overtuned or undertuned, but the biggest thing I want is for Garen to change from what he is now to something else.

Then they misuse skills and boom darius gets a big heal and enabled 5 stacks, or illaoi gets multiple tentacle offs, morde gets a shield back for a final fight, volibear gets his passive, nasus still has a Q+lifesteal threat.

Then again, his passive would be crazy considering that even if it's a small percent, true dmg can't be mitigated and you can get a lot of effective dmg out of that small percentage of the damage he deals with his abilities and autoattacks. Also, I think the after effect of the \"reworked\" ult would be buggy if the target were to for example, blink out of Garen's range to execute the Villain. I used to main Garen so I have a good idea on what you want to happen with him.\n\nAlso, I like the touch on the ult granting him in-combat sustain. However, I think you should either push the regen a bit higher or increase his base armor and MR to make him a bit tougher to deal with. Hopefully, Riot would have an interest in your ideas for a potential rework to Garen.","replies":[{"poster":"Omnem Occido","date":"2017-06-23T02:48:57.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was thinking that his ult would be like Zed's, where it pops regardless.","replies":[{"poster":"RainXBlade","date":"2017-06-23T02:53:17.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Making a sword fall out of the sky that's targeting the villain that's not within Garen's range would be in academic terms, absurd and unnecessary.
