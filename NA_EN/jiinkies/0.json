If you're using Windows 10, make sure that the Game Bar and DVR is disabled. It's been known to interfere with LoL and cause these kinds of problems, so it's best to just remove it from the equation entirely. This guide [**here**](https://www.howtogeek.com/273180/how-to-disable-windows-10s-game-dvr-and-game-bar/) can help you do just that.\n\nIf you're not using Win10, instead, try using our [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and use the 'Force Repatch' option. Lemme know if either of these steps help out and we'll proceed from there.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} ","replies":[{"poster":"BaronMunch","date":"2017-11-11T19:29:40.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this i sbullshit. I started playing this game about 3 weeks ago and the problem came up for me aswel but it doesent happen in any other game what so ever. the only thing i noticed was that when i tried using cble it didnt happen but im not able to use cable all the time. and where i live im defenetely not able to use cable. If the poblem is that i cannot use a USB INTERNET CONNECTION then i cant play this game. I want to play this game and ive already spent 20$ on this game on the account im on right now and 40$ on another account that i own but it will seem like a waste of money to buy RP in this game if i cant play without using cable","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord POW","date":"2017-05-14T03:55:01.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem with patch 7.9.
