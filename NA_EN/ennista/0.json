(If you want to know my internet speed tell me how to find out. I am using wifi) \r\nAnyway, this Christmas I have 200$ to get a new computer- either Laptop or Desktop. I am aiming for a laptop so I can take it with me and use better internets. So my problem is that I dont know anything about computers. My mom told me that she wants to get it through BestBuy because she is obsessed with BestBuy, and that I have 200$ or less to get it. I really only plan to use it to run League of Legends and maaaybe watch netflix sometimes so help? Please? PLEASE?!!{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2016-11-30T00:20:44.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keep in mind 2 things\n\nFirst, have a \"dedicated\" graphic card. It means it has an Nvidia or a GeForce and it is essential to run graphics-heavy stuff like games and to work fluidly on different stuff. You don' t need the best, but having one is better than having any. Intel usually has \"integrated graphics\" and i' d avoid them like plague.\n\nSecond, about processors i suggest you at least a quad-core, like an Intel i3, so you can run stuff smoothly.\n\nNow, where' s the problem? That most of this stuff is around 300-400 euros, idk exactly how much in dollars in USA. If you manage to get an offer where it has around these specs and the price you like, you probably got a little deal.\n\nElse, call a friend or a technician to upgrade your already existing pc, even thought if it has many years behind it might not be the case since older parts might hold back the newer or even fall down before the newer it' s still a gain for the price you intend to spend.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-29T23:58:46.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you already have existing hardware in the form of your Vista Desktop, I'd actually recommend *upgrading* your desktop rather than buying a whole new computer. Unless there is pre-existing failure going on with your desktop, tossing in a new video card, power supply and upgrading to a new version of Windows could go a long way. \n\nWhile I cannot help you directly, I'd recommend reaching out on either the [PcPartPicker Forums](http://pcpartpicker.com/forums/) or the [BuildAPC Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/), as both communities are fantastic resources, especially if you aren't the most tech-savvy player in the world.
