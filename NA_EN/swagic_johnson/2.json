You may get it from the person that was ulted, but the people who are feared won&#039;t grant you any assists. Is it something that was missed or was it intentional?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-03-22T18:02:15.004+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just double checked in game, both the swap and the fear on Urgot's ult apply assists. Suspect you may have just missed the fear on the champ in question, if not it's certainly a bug we'd fix if anyone's got a demonstration of when it occurs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Punkkee","date":"2016-03-23T00:25:09.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he has a fear? xD","replies":[{"poster":"Supreme Senpai69","date":"2016-03-23T04:06:33.709+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, they changed his ult to fear surrounding enemies.
