Essentially, the patcher believes that it downloaded all of the necessary files to be fully updated to the latest patch.  However, when the Login Screen double-checks this, it discovers that this isn't the case.  This means that the patcher failed to patch or there is some sort of corruption with the patcher itself.\n\nEither way, make sure to complete all of the steps in our [Patching Issues Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434#section-mac) (there are sections for Mac and Windows).  It should help get your patcher updated properly and get you back into the client.\n\nI hope this helps!  Let me know if you continue to experience any further issues!","replies":[]}]}
