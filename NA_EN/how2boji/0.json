Currently the only solution is to switch from windowed mode to full screen and back to windowed mode. This only happens on my computer's first boot, and all subsequent games are fine. It's more so a nuisance than anything else. I highly doubt it's a hardware issue. I use the DP cable that came with the monitor and have my monitor overclocked to 100 fps.\r\n\r\nMy setup:\r\nCPU: Intel 4690k\r\nRam: 16GB 2133hz\r\nGPU: Zotac Geforce 1080 AMP!\r\nMonitor: Acer Predator x34\r\n\r\nWindowed mode lagged only occurs with this game, and only recently has it been acting like this.\r\n\r\nAnyone else experience this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-09T04:56:37.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For a long time, overclocks of various types have caused issues with League. Can you try *temporarily* undoing your Monitor overclock to see if your issue changes at all?\n\nLet me know, thanks!","replies":[]}]}
