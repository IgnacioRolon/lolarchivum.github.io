Match history is very slow to load, sometimes takes up to a min and multiple games are missing. I've had 4-5 ranked wins that aren't showing up in history and they don't show on Lolking or OP.gg. OP.gg shows they existed but can't show the data as it's saying the games need to be loaded manually.\r\n\r\nI am still getting the LP for the wins, they are counting, but match history is acting like the games never existed.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-17T21:25:50.380+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This was something we have been investigating the last few days since we first started receiving reports about it.  Essentially, we had some issues with our back-end systems that was causing Match History to load very slowly or not at all.  We since resolved the issue and our systems are working on backfilling all the prior missing data.  This may take a few days, but your matches will eventually be added back in!\n\nI hope this helps clarifies a bit!","replies":[{"poster":"Cacique","date":"2016-06-07T21:40:36.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am glad that you have been investigating it, but your comment was a few weeks ago, and there are entire days from my history missing from just this week.  Please continue to look into it because I like to track my games.  Thanks again for your time and I hope this can be resolved soon.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pro765","date":"2017-10-14T20:31:13.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here and also very frustrating to know this issue has persisted for more then two weeks... come on Blizzard is not this slow and its record slow at fixing bugs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"tepts","date":"2016-05-17T03:00:39.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same issue but it's now giving me an error instead of showing any history:\n\n\"Error: 500\nApplication error\nAn error was encountered.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"DumbestSmartkid","date":"2016-05-17T02:14:16.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have games that still haven't shown up and it's been more than 24 hours.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ipodlolocaust","date":"2016-05-17T01:53:42.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here.","replies":[]}]}
