Having a short ultimate with a high cooldown makes you feel really clunky and bad. At that point, I would better consider a nerf of Yi's damage if it could go with reverting the ultimate over a buff of his damage and ultimate stays as it is right now.\nEven if that means reducing his winrate.","replies":[{"poster":"Maikal","date":"2016-05-21T23:56:43.533+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"To add onto this, it actually makes his win condition really shitty. In team fights, he needs to use ~2 - 3 seconds to engage, ~1 second lost while in alpha, and he will likely be cc'd/exhausted after that unless your team is so ahead that the enemy team can't afford to hold a cc ability for Yi. That leaves him with less than 3 - 4 seconds to burst a squishy if he's NOT cc'd, and the squishy will likely have some form of mobility that requires you to spend another second or 2 to get back on the target, this can reduce that to 1 - 3 seconds to burst down that squishy. That's a really shitty scenario, so Yi's win condition instead changes to split push, which is not reliable in higher elo where they know how to deal with it, especially since the shorter highlander duration hurts his 1 v 1 duels with tanks tremendously, which means he has to be snowballed too. Snowball + split push is a horrible win condition akin to that of Tryndamere, who is also in a really bad spot.\n\nNot to mention how that change decimated his identity as an assassin that catches people out and hunts them down.
