His staff and cape/ tendrils (cloth tentacle things that hang from his shoulders) are sort of lackluster in my opinion, they&#039;re just a solid color and don&#039;t really match the rest of his model, which is an awesome silvery black metal. I&#039;m not one for design but maybe there could be some particle effects coming off of his cape(s) or something like that? And his staff could have some more detail?\r\n\r\nAgain, I&#039;m not trying to bash the skin design team for anything, these are just my opinions.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-13T17:57:40.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya n0ab,\n\nThanks for the feedback - I'd be happy to pass this along to the team for discussion. ^-^","replies":[]}]}
