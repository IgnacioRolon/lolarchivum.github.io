I had this problem before in the past. Emailed support and went through a lot of things but still couldn't fix it. Then I realized the problem was from my country's connection to America server due to bad weather and all. So I had to wait for the internet company to fix it.\nThis time is the same problem but it's not from my country. The connection and everything is fine. I can play other games in NA server easy, only League I can't.\nSupport told me to try use VPN connection in the mean time so maybe u guys try that. I try it and it works, just it causes your ping to raise real high and VPN is not always healthy so consider it if u guys have to and just want to log on.\nBtw, I created another acc but in EU West server and i can log in just fine. I know it's weird and I really don't have any idea how to fix this. I think it has something to do w the new patch 'cause after the update i have this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Eliciia","date":"2016-12-16T02:39:02.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly.
