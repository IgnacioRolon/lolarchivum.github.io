But they did! The Shurima event is being celebrated as the Frejlord event was, with a lot of retcons and destruction of any lore left in the game.\n\nSo far, Amumu, Ezreal, Nasus, Rammus, Renekton, Sivir, Skarner, and Xerath have had their lore changed.\n\nOut of these, Amumu and Xerath had their lore stay consistent.\n\nNasus and Renekton are no longer from a different world, and are instead apparently centuries old Shurimans. In addition to this, Renekton's reason for hating Nasus has been removed.\n\nRammus has had his sentience gaining part of the lore removed, with his new lore saying \"k armordillo smart guis\"\n\nSivir is now a **ing heir to Shurima.\n\nSkarner has had his entire kind removed, his ties to the Crystal Scar removed, and is now \"random evil monster in Shurima ruins\"\n\nAnd finally, Ezreal has turned into a modest person.\n\nI'm sorry Riot, but having Rammus and Amumu wards is NOT compensation for utterly ruining even more lore.\n\n*EDIT2*\nNew Cass lore. http://www.surrenderat20.net/2014/09/93-pbe-update.html#more\n\n\"Cassiopeia is a terrifying creature - half woman, half snake - whose slightest glance brings death. The youngest daughter of one of Noxus' most influential families, she was once a beautiful and cunning temptress capable of manipulating the hardest heart.

Will I say I'm pleased with them? Not really, they're knocking down many aspects of the lore we've come to love. However, I think Riot's lore team has taken just a bit from the criticisms we gave them last time from the Freljord event.\n\n- {{champion:75}}  & {{champion:58}} : I expected they would retcon Nasus and Renekton to be Shurmiman at some point in time. That's a little disappointing; however, maybe we can just tell ourselves the part of Shurima they inhabited was cast away long ago to another world and, due to astral bloodlines, they were summoned back to Runeterra, or something like that? I believe that was a theory said in a discussion about Azir's lore, and I can take solace from that to retain their original backgrounds why staying with this new one. I'm not happy about it, but it'll suffice.\n\n- {{champion:33}} : Rammus' backstory has always been vague, and I think that's always been a trait of his character. He's basically a sentient, monotonous, straight-forward armadillo for the sake of being a sentient, monotonous, straight-forward armadillo. The major thing I dislike about this new background though is not the affect on Rammus himself, but rather it makes no mention of the Rune Wars like his original one, an integral part of this game's cannon as it explained why the League was made in the first place.\n\n- {{champion:15}} : Like Rammus, we didn't know a whole lot about Sivir to begin with. I can appreciate the dynamic they're trying to make with her, juxtaposing two very different lifestyles she's faced with, but I personally don't think she needs to be a heir to Shurima or whatever. It just doesn't make that much sense. Her current lore is fine. She has ties to Shurima, but is still the freelancing mercenary she's been painted out to be. I don't see why we need to have her be a long lost princess or whatever, especially considering other places can fulfill the plot/arc/trope much better (\"Ruined *Queen*\" from the Shadow Isles anyone?)\n\n- {{champion:72}} : Okay Riot wtf? I can stomach Nasus & Renekton being ancient Shurimans. I can handle Rammus' lore not directly mentioning the Rune Wars. I can cope with Sivir being a heir to Shurima. But this proposed Skarner update? I'm throwing my no's at the screen hoping this won't happen. First off, Skarner has been integrated into the lore of this game since nearly the beginning, with the conflicts of Kalamanda and whatnot. He is the embodiment not only of magical crystals that imbue the land, but the wrath of nature when mankind oversteps its boundaries and perverts the world with their arrogance & power. He is an ancient creature as fierce as he is wise, as tragic as he is noble. Don't take that away from him, as it's a great story. Second, where does that leave his race, the Brackern? Are they a race of Shuriman guardians now, because that space already seems to be occupied by Nasus and Renekton. I think many people would've loved and hoped to see another Brackern in this game, and if this retcon is going where I fear it is, that hope may be extinguished.  Third, if this goes though, the majority of Skarner's personality via quotes wouldn't even make sense. He's a fierce monstrous guardian, yet he says things like \"The Crystal Scar is weeping.\"? And if they're going to give him an entirely new VO eliminating any semblance to things like that...just no. I love how Skarner is so inhuman looking, yet inside he's actually very human, and one that deserves sympathy at that. The conflict of monster to humanity was rather nice; is he going to be turned into another clichÃ© \"giant ancient monster\" that we've already seen so much of in fantasy settings?\nAlso, if Skarner is in the end being retconned to be an inhabitant of Shurima, can the whole Kalamanda/Crystal Scar lore *at least* be moved over there with him?  As said, it was a very important story for League as a whole with still much potential to be explored, and it'd be a great shame to see it all thrown away.","replies":[{"poster":"Crimson Mutt 3","date":"2014-08-30T16:37:01.462+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":">I love how Skarner is so inhuman looking, yet inside he's actually very human\n\nThis\nHis \"rage\" has always had a subtle hint of desperation and suffering, mostly because he's all alone\nnow his rage is in the forefront and has nothing behind it other than \"rawr i'm a guardian and will kill la kill you if you take my unspecified Treasured Item #215\"\n\nRiot, please, for the love of everything, reverse your Skarner retcon.

The League of Legends was a major part of Runeterra until the lore has been getting flipped around. Summoners no longer help keep the world's disasters at bay the just plop 10 people onto top of a mountain where they proceed to kick the crap out of each other. The Noxus vs Ionia battles were amazing to hear about. It changed lore of characters and gave plenty of characters backstory. Heck the lore written by that went all the way up to Varus. The league is supposed to be able to summon mystical beings from other worlds, times, dimensions, because they are the most powerful mages in the world. Writing out a major thing such as the league and how these characters become the champions the league uses is important. The whole League aspect started to crumble when you introduced Lissandra as a champion. Ashe knows the Ice Witch is out there what Ashe isn't supposed to know is that the Princess of the Ice Dervish Tribe is that witch, Seeing Lissandra on the battlefield would bring humongous changes to the lore if it was cared about. Please Riot try thinking about champions in every aspect when you release them. Most recently with Azir coming out with his passive the game mode Dominion was forgotten about. Every aspect of the game should be considered before releasing a champion or changing a champions lore.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Baxter900","date":"2014-08-30T14:28:24.324+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally think all of them are fine except: \n\n1. Renekton's reason for hating Nasus, \"He's insane and blames Nasus...\" It's fine if they're from shurima, I even think that's a good idea, but Renekton needs a reason to hate Nasus, and ideally if you want to avoid a good vs evil scenario, Nasus should have wronged him at some point, Renekton should hate him for that, and Nasus hates him back. This allows you to essentially let Renekton play the bad guy while still letting people have sympathy for him, and Nasus can be the good guy, but you won't necessarily root for him cause he is/was a jerk.\n\n2. I personally liked Rammus being tied to the rune war, instead of re-locating his origin, instead keep his origin and let him have traveled to the Shurima desert in search of something. Since his origin's related to magic it even makes sense, maybe he's naturally attracted to some strange artifact. Also, keep his spikiness natural, it makes sense in the context, much more than \"oh yeah, and he found/made this awesome armor which let's him roll super fast in it and hurts people.\"\n\n3. Skarner was another rune war champion, and an interesting one at that. He was intelligent, he was the last of his kind, and he was alone in the world. Making him into a \"mindless monster\" guarding things is a really bad call. It's not interesting, it's not unique, it's by far the biggest change in these lore changes. There are several ways you could bring him into the conflict in Shurima. You have this nice time mage called Zilean who originates from Shurima, guess who want's to bring his race back {{champion:72}} guess who can do it with the help of relics from shurima's past {{champion:26}} . Alternatively if you **really** want Skarner guarding something, maybe he found something that could help resurrect his kind and is guarding it fiercely. Maybe Nasus, Renekton, or Azir promised him (truthfully or not) that they could bring back his race if he just does this one little thing for them. \n\n\nThe things you should be focusing on in the lore in my opinion are these things:\n\n1. What's the champions driving force? If they have one, preserve it, if they don't give them one. This is Xerath's \"take over the world\", Nasus' \"stop renekton at any cost\", and skarners, \"bring back his people\". They will complete this at any cost to themselves or often others.\n\n2. What is the champions origin? Just going to tell you this, it really upsets people if you change a champions origin when it could be avoided with the same result. The examples in these changes are Skarner and Rammus. Nasus and Renekton you had a good reason, they needed histories in the world, otherwise their conflict would never get past Renekton sides with the powerhungry side and Nasus sides against him. Skarner had a history in the world and it's easy to imagine that his goals would end up bringing him to Shurima. Rammus would likely roam the world, and it wouldn't be very hard to imagine a reason for him to come to Shurima.\n\n3. In any given situation, how would a champion act? This should rarely ever change. Sivir is selfish, her motives are always selfish, her quotes are selfish, everything about her is selfish. How is she going to act to responsibility? Sivir won't change her ways suddenly, she won't essentially be \"oh I'm descended from beings of great power, I'm gonna help them!\". She'll join the conflict if and only if there's a large reward, or she wants revenge. It's ok for her to be a \"heir to Shurima\" but she doesn't care about that and under no circumstances would suddenly start to care. This is the only big example of this in this update (and you might have planned to have something along the lines of Cassiopeia played Sivir so now Sivir hates Cassiopeia's guts) as long as it's clear that Ezreal doesn't want to be a hero because all he want to do is explore.\n\n\nJust my opinions on these, thanks for putting up the previews so we could give feedback before you did full lore changes!!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pryotra","date":"2014-08-31T13:41:46.257+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:48}} Hey Skarner.\n\n{{champion:72}} What do you want, troll?\n\n{{champion:48}} Looks like you and I shall be brothers.\n\n{{champion:72}} WHAT!?!?!

If I had to guess, the author was going for a sort of Han Solo idea, with a self-centered rogue being a bit embarrassed about being treated like a hero. I don't think that really fits with Ezreal, though: I feel like he'd love playing the hero. Lux is really into heroism.\n\nAnyway, new voicework incoming:\n\n{{champion:81}} \"Thanks, but it was really just a lucky shot.\"  \n{{champion:81}} \"Noxians?

It could be good for the long-term, which I'm sure they're prepping for.\n\nHonestly the only lore-change they made I dont really care for is Skarner's, because yeah, they did take away his connection to the Crystal Scar (unless they change the Crystal Scar to be closer/in Shurima?
