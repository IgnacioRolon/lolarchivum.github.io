I've watched quite a lot and always ask myself the question, \"Which one is my all time favorite?\" Which is tough because something new can come out, amaze me, but then remind me of another older anime that was similar and rewatch that and remember the first time I saw it. It's a tough question for me to answer but eventually I start putting down my favorites in different categories; Sci-fi, Romance, Sport/Athletic, Slice-of-life, Mystery, etc.\r\n\r\nIf I had to pick 5 though, regardless of genre or age of the show. It would have to be:\r\n\r\n* Gundam Wing\r\n* Outlaw Star\r\n* Sword Art Online\r\n* Card Captor Sakura\r\n* SHUFFLE!\r\n\r\nSo I want to ask. What is your favorite anime or what is the first anime that comes to mind for you, and what about it makes it your favorite or memorable? It can even be a show that you just hate. Why do you hate the show? I hated the anime School Days. I didn't even feel bad for the guy in the end of the show. Also kind of forced myself to watch it out of the sake of finding out why others hated the show. I found my answer.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Nekomaru","date":"2014-03-14T19:30:29.355+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This season I've really been enjoying Kill la Kill and Chuunibyou, but my all time favorites would probably be Cowboy Bebop and Full Metal Alchemist.
