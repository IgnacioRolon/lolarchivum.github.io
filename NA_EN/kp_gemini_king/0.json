What if the water increased the range of her spells : ).  It wouldn't really give her much of advantage throughout the game but it would be helpful when going for drag or baron as a team. Or What if the water made her spells do more damage (slightly like 3%) idk. I just think if nid can get a buff when moving through the bushes Nami should get one while in the water.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrathTurtle314","date":"2015-03-19T16:51:24.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why are we talking just about nami?
