Especially for players who are constantly playing good games and don't leave games normally. \"This was the first game I had to dodge in a while, and I find it unfair that I'm being penalized for something that was instigated by another summoner.\" <-- It's that kind of feeling I'm talking about and I'm sure many other summoners can understand, there are plenty of people in the community who are unreasonable, noncooperative, INSTALOCKERS. It's frustrating. Especially when you're the one penalized.\n\nI was redirected here to give my 2 cents on anything I think Riot could improve upon. Would be cool to get a response, would be cool to see a change, but if not no worries. I like playing League other than that. \n\nCheers","replies":[]}]}
