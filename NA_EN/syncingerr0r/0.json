If you did not, then your IP will just become BE 1-to-1, and you will not have a mission to recover the IP spent on runes (the Blue Essence Orbs mission).\n\nYou can read more about the requirements to get rune reimbursement at the [Preseason Update FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012640908-Preseason-Update-FAQ):\n\n>**Q: I bought lots of runes in the old system. Do I get anything for spending on the old runes?**\n\n>**A**:<snip>\n\n>So, for runes you **bought before the beginning of the 2017 season**, we'll give you 100 IP for each regular **tier 3 rune**, and 300 IP for each **tier 3 quint**. For any runes you bought since the beginning of the 2017 season, weâ€™ll refund the full IP cost.\n\n>For rune pages, the plan is for your rune pages to carry over into the new runes system, so prices on rune pages aren't being changed. However we heard from some players that being able to edit rune pages in champ select makes having more than a few pages feel less meaningful. So, for **any rune page you bought with IP**, we'll also give you back 1,500 blue essence.","replies":[{"poster":"halpmeh","date":"2017-11-11T08:18:42.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there Xaeros, earlier this evening I completed my first game on this patch.  I got a couple awesome epic skins, but if I understood correctly it looked like I should have gotten somewhere north of another 30k of BE.  I had 69k before the match and that's still what I have - perhaps I misunderstood the message?  I had around 43 or 44k of IP before the patch as I recall (was off on travel for a bit).","replies":[{"poster":"Xaeros","date":"2017-11-11T08:21:55.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"According to Porocles, they were able to check your account and verify that you didn't have any **Tier 3 runes or quints**, or **rune pages** purchased before the cut-off date.
