Before I stopped playing, even though I didn't really play much previously, I had something like 50$ worth of Riot Points on my account, since I had a 50$ CVS gift card laying around that I was never going to use. When I logged on recently though, I realized I only had 70 Riot points. I checked my purchase and gift history, but nothing was even there. I was posting this to see if over the past year or two there might have been a glitch that reset peoples accounts, but since I was inactive I didn't get refunded, or if Riot could check my account transactions since it's possible that they aren't showing up due to the amount of time it's been since they probably dissipated. If anyone has any suggestions please let me know. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-16T00:27:52.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Accounts definitely do not get reset, especially not in a way that would remove RP.
