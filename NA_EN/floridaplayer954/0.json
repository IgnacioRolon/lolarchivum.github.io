Click it and it takes you to another page, make an account on this page (A riot support account) using the same credentials that you used for your league account. Complete the e-mail verification and yada yada yada and then you can hit 'send a request' in the top right hand corner of the new page (after you've logged into your support account).\n\nYou can use this riot support request to refute any unjust bans or restrictions that you may recieve (just make sure that you really didn't deserve the ban AT ALL otherwise riot will jsut be like 'you were still toxic even though you were not the worse one on your team etc. and you are still going to serve out your ban...etc..) its also helpful if you disconnect from a game and get a leave buster ban...If it was an accident bec your internet cut out during a ranked game or anything, you can send that info to riot and have them fix what happened.\n\nYou should get your reward though. riot takes awhile sometimes.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackHorizon38","date":"2015-07-03T04:22:02.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"actually the initial support button is the last button from the left to right...its more in the middle top of the page. lol.","replies":[]}]}]}
