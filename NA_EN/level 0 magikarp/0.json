I don&#039;t know if I missed something somewhere, but I noticed that Forecast Janna&#039;s tornado has the same yellow star animation as her Star Guardian skin since the last patch or two. It bothers me since it looks a bit corny on Forecast Janna and doesn&#039;t seem to match thematically. I&#039;ve been using the Forecast Janna skin for a while and love it, so the change is pretty notable to me. I also noticed that the normal Janna and Fnatic Janna tornadoes didn&#039;t get the same particle changes--Q just became shinier-- so it doesn&#039;t seem to be intentional.\r\n\r\n{{champion:40}} {{item:3070}}  Please change it back","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-11-29T18:39:33.626+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Level 0 Magikarp - \n\nThis was an intended change for all skins and base - we opted for a yellow, as opposed to a brown (it didn't look that great, trust me. D:)\n\nThe change to update all of her (Q) particles was after discussion around Star Guardian Janna and how that skin had much better readability, as opposed to other skins. We wanted to make it even across the board, and felt that adding something similar to what we did with Star Guardian Janna would be best to improve gameplay clarity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shirvallah","date":"2016-11-26T19:52:34.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, god.
