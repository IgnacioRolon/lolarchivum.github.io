It was basically a crazy April Fool’s gag that ended up becoming hugely popular. Given how popular it is, lots of players want to know why we don’t bring back regular URF more often. There’s one reason that we haven’t really talked about before now: \nURF makes some people stop playing League. \nEvery time we ran regular URF, we’d see a huge spike of games being played, and then the numbers actually dropped back down to a level that’s lower than it was just before we ran URF. \nIt’s normal for new players to join League and for some longtime players to leave—this happens all the time. But when we turned on regular URF, it was different. In NA, for example, whenever we ran URF we’d usually see over twice as many longtime players leave the game compared to what we would’ve normally expected. \nIn other words, some people binged on URF, and then suddenly stopped playing League. And the size of the dropoff indicates that it’s not just people coming back for URF and then leaving afterwards. Despite spending a lot of time investigating the reasons, we aren’t actually sure whether URF causes some sort of “hangover” effect or if it makes regular games feel slow by comparison—maybe it’s because URF feels like playing League with cheats turned on. Regardless, after we turn on URF, total games played go down, as do overall game hours. And they don’t recover for a long time, if ever. \nWe’ve been trying to wrap our heads around a way to solve this problem for a while, and that’s one of the biggest reasons you see us experimenting with variations on the mode like ARURF and Snow Battle ARURF. Although these modes still suffer a bit from the “binge-then-churn” effect that regular URF has, it’s not nearly as bad (probably because you’re not seeing the same OP champs every game). \nURF causes some people to stop playing League, but a lot of you really love it. So instead of killing URF altogether, we’re just gonna keep experimenting to find some healthier version of the mode. Tell us your thoughts about Snow Battle ARURF—we’ll listen and apply what we learn to ARURF’s next appearance. \n\nIt did happen.","replies":[{"poster":"Blåbæret","date":"2018-01-02T06:43:41.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And it never occured to you that Rito is lying?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Disembark","date":"2018-01-01T03:11:39.983+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So they make changes every 2 weeks -> they don’t see this decline\n\nThey remove URF -> they see the decline \n\nAll the more reason to believe it’s URF and not the patches.

That doesn't suddenly negate the problems with the game, sot hat argument is pointless. \n\nNot to mention even people in high elo are saying its becoming RNG. People who were in plat or higher having problems getting out of gold now because its become such a snowball fest that when 1 lane outside of their own feeds they have no power over the game anymore. \n\nSo even by your own words you just proved yourself wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Schenix","date":"2018-01-01T23:50:39.763+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would have to say that both are true.\n\nThey do not get there randomly usually. There is an exceptional microgame skill to carry harder than opponents clearly beneath you, or higher macrogame knowledge with decision making that makes climbing much more consistent in a myriad of situations.\n\n\nThat being said, it does not negate the issue that it is becoming more difficult to solo carry without the right champion, or taking more effort each season (other than ardent bot meta). The agency of a single player without the hyper carry champion has been nearly removed in place of damage creep or utility itemization. \n\nNow, that can be a good thing both ways because if your top gets fed, and your mid feeds -- you don't auto lose the game. It's if a lane feeds, and they know how to push an advantage that they get so far ahead so fast, that you can't do anything; or if they have a better champion for carrying a game due to the insane amount of impact they can now provide due to the wide margin even a small snowball leads to. It's become a more punishing game. Which might seem nice until you realize the agency you have has been reduced based on what champion you are playing, or if they pushed a lead even slightly. The rewards to many champions for punishing a mistake has become too high. Which means the losing team has to climb a huge slope to get back on level ground, or be much better at macro. \n\n\nHonestly, if all paths could be like the Inspiration tree -- that would be great. Actual choices, not just amplifying damage in one way or the other. The new runes, while interesting, are no better at balance than the previous. The immunity most adc's get for power in one dimension or the other isn't helpful either, as well as tanks being both broken and useless at the same time because the state of the game allows damage dealers to hit one kill and snowball where a tank has to climb a steady incline without being kicked off in order to become that broken machine. Hence why, tacking damage onto a tank makes it so you can't ignore them -- and then they snowball too because their damage is coupled with being even harder to kill against an opponent who is already behind. \n\nComes back to, the rewards for a successful punish have become too harsh -- without as many opportunities to reverse the game state; regardless of your agency on the game that requires you to either be amazing at early game, or play the macro very well. Hence, more difficult to climb, yet those who know what they are doing will climb as they are.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Abibyama","date":"2018-01-01T07:23:59.197+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":5,"body":"Like who the fuck cares?
