Riot's current punishment system operates on tiered structure, with escalating punishments based on *how often* you've been punished previously. The scale looks something like this:\n\n* 10-game chat restriction\n* 25-game chat restriction\n* 14-day time ban\n* perma-ban\n\nWithin this system, you were given multiple opportunities to bring your behavior into line. Your failure to do so is the primary factor in this ban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"No flash no life","date":"2016-03-23T04:57:13.991+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately unless it was due to a mistake, riot is not going to unban a banned account.
