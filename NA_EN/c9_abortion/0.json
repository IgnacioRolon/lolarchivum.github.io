It started off with the questions being changed and now the entire account doesn't belong to me and im not sure what to do\r\n\r\nI can't e-mail riot because the account isn't linked to my account and I don't know the security questions because they have been altered and I've invested so much into my account and i really just dont know what to do. I tried to post on /r/leagueoflegends but it was removed due to the matter being issues with my account personally.\r\n\r\nPlease help guys idk what to do and i really want my account","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-20T23:02:20.181+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked at the account and your ticket and this isn't something we'd be able to resolve in a public forum.  However, I may be able to clarify a couple things and give more context as to what's happened:\n\n* The suspension on the account isn't due to reports, but is instead a proactive suspension to prevent further access to the account while it's being investigated\n\n\n* Even if the e-mail has been changed, we can check what the e-mails used to be on the account\n\n\n* In general, there's a lot of missing context as to the history of the account. Based on the current information provided, I would also support the specialist in not recovering the account at this time.  We're always open to re-analyzing with more information.  Even if it's not within the list of questions we ask, any additional information/context you can provide us helps greatly.","replies":[{"poster":"C9 Abortion","date":"2016-05-21T01:29:57.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"could u some how pm me the info that you aren't allowed to discuss publicly?

That's why we ask players to create tickets for these sorts of things instead as there's not really anything we can do on the boards.\n\nIf you do remembers or have other information that you think can help, update your ticket and we'll take a look.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
