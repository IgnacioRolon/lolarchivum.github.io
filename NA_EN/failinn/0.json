Often times I will join a game, go through pick/bans, and my client will crash and initiate a self-repair. This has now happened about 6 times today. Leave Buster has now marked me as purposely leaving games and kicks me to the lower priority que. If this happens in ranked games, I also lose LP. Is there any fix to this currently? And don't tell me to use the repair tool, and that has failed numerous times now. \r\n\r\nP.S. For the love of god, stop punishing me for issues with your client.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-01T22:53:10.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to hear that your game crashed, though it's good to hear that it was able to detect and resolve the corruption that caused it.  The updated client is still in testing so it's possible to run into trouble, and and account would only receive a [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) after a history of leaving- not just one game.  Hopefully everything is okay now, as completing the required games is the only way to get rid of the queue.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
