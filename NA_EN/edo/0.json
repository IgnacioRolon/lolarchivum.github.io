I wanted to ask am I the only one who&#039;s having this problem and is there anyway I could fix it. I think I might know the cause of it, I read somewhere that someone wrote, a rioter I think that there&#039;s a problem in unpacking sound files or something in late game and I also heard from a friend that it&#039;s beacuse of the minions that die but are still present on the map hence giving the cpu extra load. It would be great if the reply could be from a rioter. Really appreciate it :D","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-07-12T10:17:51.379+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Boost your FPS by utilising the **[Frames for days booster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting)** This booster is legal and is approved by Riot.\n\nhttp://riot-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/images/news/Skins/Tristana_RocketGirl_Splash.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-12T15:45:04.943+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a big fan of the frames for days booster, so I'm glad to see Rineyy mentioned it here.

It has nothing to do with corrupt game files or odd local settings. The more likely scenario is that ever since the new map, you guys have had to re-code how the \"loading screen\" works, and the game is not properly loading all the required assets in the loading screen anymore, which results in the need to pull them from the hard drive (instead of the RAM) when certain new assets (skills, wards, etc) are used in game, which results in slowdowns because HD access is slower than RAM access.\n\nAlso: I believe you are wrong about the game patching \"the moment the client requests it.\" I have extensively looked into how the game handles corrupt/missing files, and it seems to work like this:\n\n1) Game detects a missing or corrupt file. If the game doesn't crash it ignores it, and pretends it doesn't exist.\n\n2) Game puts a blank file called \"SOFT_REPAIR\" into \"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_game_client\\releases\\<current patch folder>\"\n\n3) The next time the patcher loads, it will check for \"SOFT_REPAIR\" and if it exists it will say your game files are corrupted, and ask you to repair. It will then scan ALL your files, repair corrupt/missing ones, and delete \"SOFT_REPAIR\"\n\ntl;dr whoever coded how the \"loading screen\" works before a match did it wrong when they updated it for the new map. Which was a REALLY long time ago at this point.\n\nPS: I just tried running League from a ram-drive, and so far I have had almost zero slowdowns. Which just further proves my point (your spaghetti code is trying to read the HD during the game instead of during the load screen like it's supposed to - causing slowdowns). The RARE slowdowns I have had were reduced to a 0.05 second stutter using the RAM-Drive, and happen maybe once every 2 or 3 games. Compare that to the 0.25 second stutters I get when running from a normal HD, which happen 5-10+ times per game.\n\nEDIT: I copy/pasted this from another thread because you appear to be posting false information. As evidenced by the fact that a fresh install does not fix it, but a RAM-drive does.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-07-14T09:48:20.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad you're also a fan! :D","replies":[]}]}]}]}
