Then randomly upon starting a new game right after champ select when youre suppose to go the champion loading screen to load into the game all I saw was a black screen. After waiting a few minutes a note saying connection error popped up, I tried restarting client and my laptop but it just kept happening. I was trying the whole game to fix it but couldn't, then randomly the new honor screen to honor one of my 4 teammates appeared, I clicked next and I was in the end game screen and I saw all my team say to report me. Nothing like this has ever happened before and I'm afraid to enter another game because of it. I tried a custom game right after just with myself and I loaded in fine just like normal so no idea what went wrong or if it will happen again. Really hope I don't get leaver buster because of this issue out of my control.","replies":[{"poster":"TheSlapTRAINBg","date":"2017-07-07T08:57:26.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have same problem.

Let's take a couple precautions first by checking up on your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) just in case something went a little haywire in there. Test it out in another custom or practice match and hit me back up if you're still having problems.","replies":[]}]}
