Now keep in mind, I'm by no means some diamond+ player. I've only peaked at Plat 2 at best, but hopefully this helps people that main support. I've played each role plenty over the years, but during my first year or two of LoL, I focused on primarily supporting. Back in my DotA days, I mained support too. So...many...omniknight...games...and CM...and so on. First and foremost, you're going to have to accept that people will often ignore you as a support. Seeing as you aren't doing any Insec plays with Lee Sin or shadow swapping with Zed, not many will realize how much you are doing to keep your team working smoothly. Vision is a team game, but it's mostly in your hands. Often enough, your abilities make or break fights with even just one clutch heal/shield. Your K/D/A wont have much more than some deaths and assists. People will even forget WHY you died to get all those kills for your teammates. Sure, by now you already know all this, but the sad thing is, many forget what a support TRULY does. I think of it like a military medic. You save lives, you aren't necessarily meant for combat, but you sure as hell will do what you can to save people. Kind of silly to use something so heroic as a comparison to video games, but you get my drift. ;P\n\nWith all that in mind, take a step back. Consider how many people play games like LoL for glory, a sense of accomplishment, or even just bragging rights. There's such a large combination of egos mixing into one game under specific conditions required for success. Lots of people don't realize how much their team could give to make that Pentakill happen though. One Amumu ult that catches all 5 people, or a mantra'd Karma E that just barely mitigates damage that would have wiped your whole team. There's so many different possibilities. That's what makes this game so great to play for me. You'll meet some real crappy people on the internet for sure, but man...finding that group of people(or even just one or two)is a pretty awesome feeling. Don't let the bad people ruin the game for you, because you'll definitely get good games filled with good people. I guarantee that. One of those good people I met playing this game ended up being my best man in my wedding. What are the chances of that? ;D\n\nDon't give up though. I challenge ADC mains to play support for a while to understand the struggle of the role. Laners, try jungling to get the feeling of how much presence everyone expects of you. Mid mains, try playing a tank top/jungle to know how much your frontline dies for you to get the job done. \n\nFind what makes you enjoy what you play and play it. If you can't, take a break or find something else. My hope is that everyone that has this struggle gets past a slump like this. At the end of the day we should be enjoying this game together. We're a community and a family when it comes down to it. Let's stop tearing each other down and just play the game we all enjoy.\n\nBest of luck to each of you guys that feel like OP here, and keep playing your favorite roles!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2016-06-12T05:04:31.982+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's worth mentioning that Riot has some changes in store for supports after the patch this week.

I have a theory that S ranks in RGM appear to be based off both performance and a checklist.\n\nFor example, the last round of Poro King, I played a lot of Morgana because I didn't have her S rank chest. Three games I did very well, and got an A+. I was livid until I realized that I had only been using one summoner spell, the poro toss. I never had a situation in those three games where I needed to teleport to the King.\n\nSo I get into a game, do about as well as I did the other three games, but used both summoners frequently. I teleported to the King even when I was right behind him, needlessly, several times. Did everything else as much the same as I could. Boom, S rank.\n\nI also noticed that players who ascend in Ascension at least twice for any amount of time (and do even decently well as far as K/D) tend to gather S ranks like they were candy. Don't get me wrong, it's easy to rack up the kills and points when you're ascended, but there are times those golden giants don't live long enough to do anything.\n\nAs far as the RGM go, I believe a large part of S ranks is using the unique features of the gamemode even if you don't actually accomplish much with them. The game only seems to care if you did them in the first place.\n\nI tried to test this on Hexakill, but there's nothing really unique to that mode other than the capture points and Vilemaw. I've had two S rank games as Chogath and my team never got Vilemaw either time. Point capture _seems_ to be a check on the checklist, but it's hard to gather data when you don't get credit for helping to capture a point your ally got to first and you can't retake a point until the enemy take it back.","replies":[{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2016-06-13T15:11:39.560+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That does make a lot of sense.
