I'm back it at about 13 minutes and I know that cuz rift died after I killed sivir upon returning I played out the rest of that 35:54 minute match. We win then I get demoted. Like the system isn't working right if that equals demote. I'm ok with just not getting the points but I'm there for the majority of the game and I won","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-04-26T20:06:46.572+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It sucks, but the system cant tell the difference between a ragequit, a troll, and technical issues. It has to treat all equally, or risk the first two exploiting whatever \"innocent person with shit hardware protection feature\" to get away with AFKing.\n\nIn the end, all three ruin games more often than not, and it is up to the players to ensure their systems are as stable as possible - not that you can do much for a large-scale power outage, but it sounds like this was more localized..","replies":[{"poster":"The Diccining","date":"2019-04-26T21:45:40.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sure but thats isn't my issue honestly my issue is im there for 33 of 36 minutes and the 3 missing minutes were very early in the game and i got demoted off of that","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Julevi","date":"2019-04-26T19:42:27.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! In cases like this it's probably due to you being afk (even though it is not your fault) for more than 3 minutes. This automatically leads to a loss for you, although you came back and participated.","replies":[{"poster":"The Diccining","date":"2019-04-26T19:46:56.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then I mind as well not come back lol why have a system that punishes you even if you trying to help?","replies":[{"poster":"Julevi","date":"2019-04-26T19:53:28.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's actually a really good question and I ask myself this one everytime I stumble across these threads.\n\nFor me I always come back (when possible) as I think it is my duty to support my team even when I do not benefit from it at all. Although I have never met them I still feel kinda guilty letting them down and personally I would be always glad to see a player returning just for the sake of helping the team. But after all I admit that this is a pretty weak argument because it misses actual rewarding and is subjective.","replies":[{"poster":"The Diccining","date":"2019-04-26T21:44:03.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"honestly its then just a waste of 20 minutes its unreasonable for me to mis 3 minutes of a 36 minute game and get demoted. with demoted being the key word here. it would be one thing if i just didn't get the points but i got demoted when we won im there for 94% of the game","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Deliberate Inter","date":"2019-04-26T19:58:28.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Working as intended.","replies":[]}]}
