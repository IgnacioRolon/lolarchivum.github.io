Around World Championships, a lot of events and promotions happen, and sometimes that can cause patches to be a bit larger than normal. In this case, the [Teemoing event](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/skins/the-teemoing-2016) was a bit bigger than what we did last year, so the patch for this event was a bit heftier than the patches before it. Additionally, the time it takes to patch can vary depending on the size of the patch and your network's bandwidth.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HeyItzSteve","date":"2016-10-22T02:35:54.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Updates can take a long time if you haven't played League in a while and there are a lot of new updates to install. But if you play League everyday and updates takes over 30 minutes, that could be a issue from your computer being too slow or old.","replies":[]}]}
