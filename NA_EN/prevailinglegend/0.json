For fixed offset it displays your champion in the middle of the screen. For those who use preside offset (me) it displays the champ a little higher in the north side of the screen. This helps me play when I&#039;m on red side as it enables me to be able to see the enemy side a little easier. This has been a real problem for me. This is gonna hold me back from being able to play effectively until it is resolved. \r\n\r\n- Many league players who experience troubles without using preside offset.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-01T18:00:10.970+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"We're working on a fix. :]","replies":[{"poster":"PrevailingLegend","date":"2016-02-02T02:58:10.273+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks @Riot KateyKhaos :-]","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Everstorm","date":"2016-02-07T17:07:01.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can u not fix it in between patches.
