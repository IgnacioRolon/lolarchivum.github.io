People are acting like Cinderhulk is better than the old Jungle items (when it isn't).\n\nElder Lizard gave TRUE DAMAGE burn, and Ancient Golem gave a permanent blue buff (sort of). The new Jungle items are actually MUCH worse than the old ones.","replies":[{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-04-20T17:59:31.799+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ancient Golem did nothing to speed up clear, and apart from mana regen was useless in any fights.","replies":[{"poster":"PalPlays","date":"2015-04-20T19:30:11.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Silents429,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1h8HvY6o,comment-id=0000000000010000,timestamp=2015-04-20T17:59:31.799+0000)\n>\n> Ancient Golem did nothing to speed up clear, and apart from mana regen was useless in any fights.\n\nYes, it added a 5% bleed effect against Monsters.
