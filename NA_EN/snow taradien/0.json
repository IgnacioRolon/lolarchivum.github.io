But he's just awful.\n\nLiterally anything he can do utility wise, with the exception of magical journey, Kayle can do too, and better!\n\nKayle's Q is a non skillshot slow, guarenteed to hit, that CHUNKS for damage.\n> ACTIVE: Kayle blasts a target enemy, dealing magic damage, Slow icon slowing its movement speed for 3 seconds and applying a stack of Holy Fervor.png Holy Fervor.\n> MAGIC DAMAGE: 60 / 110 / 160 / 210 / 260 (+ 60% AP) (+ 100% Bonus AD)\n> SLOW: 35 / 40 / 45 / 50 / 55%\n\nBard's q is a skillshot that is rarely a stun because people understand how bard works and wont group when he's nearby. So as far as it matters its a skillshot based slow that has an extremely slow missile, horrifically bad range, and scaling that make the attack little more than a tickle.\n> ACTIVE: Bard fires out a burst of spirit energy in a line, dealing magic damage and briefly Slow icon slowing the first enemy struck by 60%.\n> MAGIC DAMAGE: 75 / 110 / 145 / 180 / 215 (+ 50% AP)\n> SLOW/STUN DURATION: 1 / 1.2 / 1.4 / 1.6 / 1.8\n> After Cosmic Binding hits an enemy, the burst of energy continues through, searching for secondary targets. If it hits a wall or a second enemy, it Stun icon stuns the affected units, dealing magic damage to the second unit as well.\n\n* Just because it can do more in theory means nothing, it LITERALLY ALWAYS does less than Kayles, the slow is a little better yeah but it doesn't last nearly half as long until you almost max it.\n\nKayle's W is a heal that gives movement speed, and both scale decently.\n> ACTIVE: Kayle blesses a target allied champion, healing them and increasing their movement speed for 3 seconds.\n> HEAL: 60 / 105 / 150 / 195 / 240 (+ 45% AP)\n> MOVEMENT SPEED: 18 / 21 / 24 / 27 / 30% (+ 7% per 100 AP)\n\n7% MORE movement speed per 100AP, and 45% on ap scaling for the heal.\n\nBard's w is a decent heal that... gives movement speed but only the heal scales and it needs a long time to reach max effectiveness compared to Kayles which is INSTANT and always better.\nYes bard can place three down. But that's it, that's the only upside.\n> * ACTIVE: Bard conjures a health shrine at the target location that builds up in power over 10 seconds. Bard can have up to 3 shrines active at once, which remain until visited by an ally or crushed by an enemy.\n> * Allied champions who step over the shrine will consume it, healing for an amount based on the shrine's power and gaining 50% bonus movement speed which decays over 1.5 seconds. Enemy champions who step on the shrines will destroy it.\n> * MINIMUM HEAL: 30 / 60 / 90 / 120 / 150 (+ 20% AP)\n> * MAXIMUM HEAL: 70 / 110 / 150 / 190 / 230 (+ 45% AP)\n\nIt takes TEN whole seconds to reach its maximum, does overall WAY less healing than Kayle's heal, has a flat movespeed buff that decays too quickly to be worth anything and plus, setting them up anywhere but under the tower guarentees the enemy to just walk u[p and make the heal invalid. Even at MAX it still doesn't heal as much as Kayle. Only early game and only a tiny bit.\n\n\n\nKayle's R straight up makes the person of her choice instantly invincible for two whole seconds. AND they can keep moving and fighting.\n> ACTIVE: Kayle bathes a target ally champion or herself in holy light, rendering the champion immune to all damage for a few seconds. (AND ITS FREE TO USE AND IS ON LOW CD)\n\nBard's is an impossible to hit anything with Zhonya's bomb that is slower than mollasses in freljord and is better for getting your teammates killed or denyin them kills.\n> ACTIVE: Bard sends magical energy arcing to a target location. On impact, all units — allied, enemy and neutral — in the target 175-radius area are put in Stasis icon stasis for 2.5 seconds, becoming untargetable and invulnerable but also unable to perform any action.\n> \n> Epic monsters and turrets (excluding Dominion turrets and the Nexus Obelisk) are also put in Stasis icon stasis , despite normally being immune to disabling abilities.\n> \n\nYeah it lets you deny baron and shit, lets you stop them for 2.5 seconds isntead of longer. But ffs its useless because not only is there a huge warning for the enemy team its just impossibly slow as a missile. Good god why.\n\nThe only thing bard has is his journey. Which enemies can use anyway. Yes he can set up ganks, and can exist as a jungle support. But ffs he's so underpowered and squishy why even bother.\n\nHe has one of the lowest level 18 attack damage values in game at 97. One of the slowest movespeeds at 330 which REALLY hinders him because even tho the chimes speed him up? No booties? You aren't getting ANYWHERE. His attack speed scaling is atrocious. 1% per level, really?? He has virtually no mana, nonexistant regen on that mana, he's squishy as hell... what am I even supposed to do with this guy other than roll around collecting chimes.\n\nUtility is great and all but in the games Ive played with him I never once felt like I was helping my team. As a support main thats what I should be doing. Never ONCE felt that with bard because you're so weak without those chimes you lit have to grind them all game to get anything. They end up giving too little anyway to be of value so it just feels gimmicky. You fall behind in exp cause they give too little.\n\nKayles final AD? 104. Scaling on her attack speed? 2.2%.\nArmor is only 3 points less than bard and move speed is 5 higher than  him, but she makes up for it with her better regen of both mana, and hp, DPS and obscene heal+move spell making her a better support any day. Plus she can guarentee a GREAT slow, and Guarentee saving a partner.\n\nBard can't do anything except fill a slot where he's mediocre all game, he never gets a power boost at any point. The only thing he has going for him, his E, ends up with him having the enemy able to chase him and his team down, Its like he was designed to assist the enemy.\n\nTLDR if bard is gonna stay where he is he's trash.\nPlaying him simply is bad atm.","replies":[{"poster":"Edyr420","date":"2015-03-13T12:35:18.880+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats so true, i played him a few games and i noticed that he is just about his ult.\nif you manage to ult 3 enemies in a tf, you win. if not you may have killed your whole team or deny kills.\n-his E only useful in rare cases, can also kill your whole team if placed wrong.\n-he does 0 dmg.\n-his passive is pointless.\n-his w has too much mana costs in early game and doesnt do that much in lategame.\nmaybe i dont know how to play him perfectly but his kit doesnt fit in league at all imo.","replies":[{"poster":"Snow Taradien","date":"2015-03-13T12:38:41.860+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"His kit is better suited for a game like Dawngate, which tbh is what he looks like he's been pulled right out of.\nBut that game has no mana.

I feel he is a fairly Healthy champ but just requires a different play style.  His E can be very useful to set yourself up and cut enemies off as they try to escape. I do admit his heal isn't that to strong and his stun can be tricky to hit but over all i really enjoy playing him.   Does he need a buff? Maybe but for all i can see he seems fine to me.  \n\n If you wish to do more damage then collect up to like 70 chimes and you'll see he can pack quite a punch and because of his meeps doing magic damage and counting as a spell cast the new 120 ap item's passive procs and does 100 more magic damage by just landing a basic attack. So basically a {{item:3087}}  for Bard. Plus 120 ap helps quite a bit with him.

I like Bard, I really do. but he is not very fun to play. why? because he is just a ward bag. \n\nLane: Bard is trash. He is squishy, has very minuscule sustain, has low damage, and has low CC. with proper runes/masteries, mana isnt really a problem. but he will get poked out, he cant engage, and he can be killed very easy. he doesn't have much of a way to help the carry and its because of his abilities.\n\n>ANCIENT CHIMES: Bard's presence causes sacred chimes to appear at a random location on the field, which linger for up to 10 minutes. Collecting a chime grants Bard a brief burst of movement speed out of combat for 7 seconds (stacking up to 5 times), experience, and restores 15 + 8% missing mana. Every 5 chimes Bard collects empower his meeps.\n\t\n\n> MEEPS: Bard's presence attracts small spirits known as meeps to his side. Whenever Bard attacks, one of his meeps throws itself at his target, dealing 「 30 - 465 」( + 20 per 5 chimes collected after 150) (+ 30% AP) bonus magic damage before disappearing back to the spirit world. At 5 Chimes, meeps Slow icon slow damaged enemies by 25 / 45 / 60 / 70 / 75% / 80% for 1 second, and at 25 Chimes they deal area of effect damage in a cone behind the main target, with the cone's size increasing at 65 chimes. Meeps spawn every 12 / 11 / 10 / 9 / 8 seconds and Bard can hold up to 1 / 2 / 3 / 4.\n\nBard's Passive is kinda cool. but mostly useless. Collecting them is very time consuming. i get that you are supposed to collect them when you go to ward, or you go to gank, but they don't do enough for you to make it worth going to collect them. the XP is practically non-existent. the speed boost is non-existent as well UNLESS you collect 3-5 of them, then its okay. The mana is useless, like i said before, with proper runes/masteries, Bard doesn't really need very much mana regen. Upgrading the meeps is nice, but it takes till mid-late game for them to become of any use and you can only hold up to 4 of them at most. \n\nAlso the Spawn locations. Bard's Chimes will spawn wherever they feel like it. which is a problem. Bard is normally bottom, so they will mainly spawn bottom. this causes problems. A lot of the time, Bard's Chimes spawn under the enemy turret, so you will not be able to get them for a long time. also whenever bard goes to collect a Chime, the Enemy know exactly where he is going. this is not a huge problem, because a good player will just their stuns that they throw at you, but it is annoying. So with these things, Bards passive is pretty useless other than the meeps, which are mediocre.\n\n> ACTIVE: Bard fires out a burst of spirit energy in a line, dealing magic damage and briefly slowing the first enemy struck by 60%.\nMAGIC DAMAGE: 75 / 110 / 145 / 180 / 215 (+ 50% AP)\nSLOW/STUN DURATION: 1 / 1.2 / 1.4 / 1.6 / 1.8\nAfter Cosmic Binding hits an enemy, the burst of energy continues through, searching for secondary targets. If it hits a wall or a second enemy, it Stun icon stuns the affected units, dealing magic damage to the second unit as well.\nRANGE: 925 COST: 60 MANA COOLDOWN: 11 / 10 / 9 / 8 / 7\n\nI like this ability. it has neat mechanics that make it skill orientated. however, you will NEVER land the stun in lane. Trying to shoot it from a creep to a champ is almost impossible, because the creeps are so close together that the stun will almost always just hit 2 creeps. trying to land it on a hero and then a creep is also hard, because they have to be in front of the creep wave for that. Just trying to land the slow is hard enough. The Skill Shot moves at a ridiculously slow rate, so everybody and their crippled grandmother can get out of the way. it is far to slow to every land it reliably, everyone sees is coming, and gets out of the way.\n\nBecause it is so slow and unreliable, you might as well pick a different support. seriously, Leona, Kayle, heck even Veigar is more reliable. he doesn't have any all in with this ability, because its too unreliable. the creeps block it, so you can hardly poke with it, and it is way too slow.\n\n> ACTIVE: Bard conjures a health shrine at the target location that builds up in power over 10 seconds. Bard can have up to 3 shrines active at once, which remain until visited by an ally or crushed by an enemy.\nAllied champions who step over the shrine will consume it, healing for an amount based on the shrine's power and gaining 50% bonus movement speed which decays over 1.5 seconds. Enemy champions who step on the shrines will destroy it.\nMINIMUM HEAL: 30 / 60 / 90 / 120 / 150 (+ 20% AP)\nMAXIMUM HEAL: 70 / 110 / 150 / 190 / 230 (+ 45% AP)\nRANGE: 1000 COST: 100 / 105 / 110 / 115 / 120 MANA COOLDOWN: 12\n\nThis heal is crap. like above, you can see how he explained it. I don't really need to go into further detail.\n\n> ACTIVE: Bard opens a magical corridor through the first piece of terrain in front of him through to the other side. Both allies and enemies can use the corridor by right-clicking on its entrance, with allies travelling faster than enemies. There is no limit to the length of the corridor. The corridor only works in one direction and can thus be travelled only from one side to the other but there is no limit to the number of times you can travel through it.\nALLY BONUS MOVEMENT: 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 / 50%\nMagical Journey will not cast unless it will open a corridor.\nRANGE: 1000 COST: 30 MANA COOLDOWN: 26 / 24 / 22 / 20 / 18\n\nThis ability is useless. playing Bard, i usually only use this ability an average of 2-4 times usefully. there are no walls that make this ability a huge gank potential, so that is out of the question. it cant be used as an escape because they can follow you, and the cooldown is way too long. they could have at least made it so that it has charges like VI E. But overall, you will never get to use it productively.\n\n> ACTIVE: Bard sends magical energy arcing to a target location. On impact, all units — allied, enemy and neutral — in the target 325-radius area are put in Stasis icon stasis for 2.5 seconds, becoming untargetable and invulnerable but also unable to perform any action.\nEpic monsters and turrets (excluding Dominion turrets and the Nexus Obelisk) are also put in stasis , despite normally being immune to disabling abilities.\nRANGE: 2500 COST: 100 MANA COOLDOWN: 130 / 115 / 90\n\nLike above, His ult will either kill your team, or cause a team wipe. there is nothing else too it. for ganks, it is too slow, just like his Q, so it can be dodge quit easy. meanwhile, the rest of the game, you never want to or get a chance to use it because everybody is clumped together. there is no reliable chance to use it. and i get it, they don't want it to be game breaking. but you will never get the use the thing because there is never a chance you will get to use it.everybody moves too much, and or is really clumped together.\n\n\nLike i said before, i really like the IDEA of Bard, but unfortunately, he is a crappy character and no fun to play. you spend your time in shitty bottom lane, then you roam up and hopefully gank (not usually because any half-decent player will see it coming), you will never get to use his E for a gank, even though the theory is cool, there are no walls that make this ability reliable. his Q will never land unless the player is distracted with other things, it is far to slow. his W is weak, and since you can only have 3, there isn't really a point in placing them down other then the beginning of laning phase, and his ult it just too unreliable and sketchy to throw most of the time. So most of the game you just run around and place wards, collect your chimes for little reason, and die, because you are too squishy. I wish i could have fun playing Bard, but he is not very fun to play. They made a unique character, that is far too unreliable to be playing in the top tier.","replies":[{"poster":"Snow Taradien","date":"2015-03-17T01:10:54.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you this all the way.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ltank129","date":"2015-03-16T19:22:04.925+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would agree. He is a high skill champ, compared to Kayle, who is not as complicated to use.\n\nHe brings great sustain. His W and his Chimes keep him with full health and mana indefinitely. I wouldn't be so quick to discount his q's stun. It can be used creatively, although a boost to the speed would be wonderful.\n\nI think if chimes appeared fastter he would be better, as it would make him scale better late game to counter his early squishyness.\n\nHis Ult's travel time could also be sped up. I have missed it so many times because I shot it at maximum range and completely missed. Or maybe have a Cooldown reduction if it doesn't hit anything.\n\nHe doesn't have the poke of Lulu, Morg, or even Braum. He doesn't have the sustain of Soraka, Sona or Nami. He doesn't offer the kill potential of Blitz Thresh or Leona unless he lands a perfect q. He brings a lot to the table as a support, but numberwise he is off. His heal is decent but costs a lot of mana, which means he has to roam. \n\nI would love to see a comparison of a series of game where his passive is completely ignored and where his passive is emphasized, just to see if it really is that much of a benefit. Other than the Mana Regen, I don't see it affecting gameplay that much, compared to Thresh's passive / Nasus's q/ Viegar's Q.\n\nI think if they made the passive more powerful, scaling better off fewer chimes or they make the chimes appear faster it would benefit him greatly. Also more Xp per chime, since he always is behind.","replies":[{"poster":"Snow Taradien","date":"2015-03-17T01:08:24.957+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the real kicker here and I think you guys all hit it right on the head, the passive is his real weakest point and needs to be more rewarding if its gonna stay as is.

Im playing bard now since release, and I think I got a nice  hang of it. The Passive is actually pretty nice, but should reward slightly more exp to compensate for the time youre leaving your lane. Cause thats usually killing me. Oh, and the fact meeps spawn in the far end of enemy jungle @ lvl 6 just cause I helped mid with placing 1 healing shrine xD. Instead of near me, obviously.\n\nAlso I just cant fathom why every champ with a stun can just *press Q for awesome sun* and with bard it has to be so hard. I mean, its even glitched! If I hit a minion it jumps of to the minion left and right instead of the champion behind it. I would personaly suggest something as A: More range for the ability itself and the after-shock (cause usually I bring myself in danger, just cause I really want that stun). B: Maybe something like, if you shoot and hit a minion/champion/whatever. Always prioritize champions as second target if one is near (abit compared to Ahri her W and R). And there should be some damage scaling..I mean come on, Q and Meeps are bards only way of dealing damage. and when youre out of meeps, done youre Q. Youre a sitting duck lol.\n\nThe W is just, awesome! But realy, waiting 10 seconds is just abit too much if youre at lvl 6+.  Tho I understand how this would be OP in comparison to Kayle her W if the CD would be gone. So I would suggest (so bard would be more viable in team fights) to lower the CD by 2 seconds for each rank you upgrade it and keep the initial end-heal slightly lower then the one kayle gives. And to top it off, instead of it giving its full heal after 10/8/6/4 seconds, make it scale. So if you place it, it heals 30. After 1 sec it heals 20% of 30, 2 secs another 10%, 3 secs another 8%, etc etc. All the way to the max health. With idea so it has some use when you planted it 2 secs, but even more use after it bloomed. This way you can put it out into the field, estimating where youre allieds will be pushed to, so they can instantly heal themselves. BUT they will heal less then kayle will. So kayle is more the personal support and bard more the team support :) This will compensate for the fact bard damage is significantly lower then kayles damage of course. \n\nAnd lets not forget the most annoying thing of all: Enemies what can crush your shrines. Just when you thought you got a teambattle straight, some dude comes in and steps on it. Tbh I would be fine, if enemies cant see it. Make the shrines invisible for enemies, but when they happend to stand on it. Poof its crushed. OR!...what would be even better (would give bard some fall-back damage too). If you use the shrine on an allied, it heals. If you use it on an enemy, it deals damage. Some kind of mine-trap idd. But the difference is, it doesnt deal that much damage as a teemo mushroom or cait/nidalee trap. And enemies can see/avoid it. The damage should be half the heal it gives so there is some kind of fair trade for the one stepping on it.\n\nE, nothing wrong with it! I love it. But It does need some hitbox fixing xD. Cause sometimes I am standing 10 seconds still just to find the right click\n\nR, it has so much potential. I saved so many lifes. I love it! Only thing that would make it even better/more viable perhaps is one of the following:\n*A side effect like a slow for enemies, speed for allieds (of like 1 sec long)\n\n*A side effect like a small healing over time for allieds\n\n*Alittlebit of damage to enemies.\n\nBut what it definitely needs is global scale. So range all across the map. Since it takes a while before it lands (flight speed and such), you can be usefull even if you just respawned by shooting it at some groep enemies, or enemy tower, allied tower, etc. \n\nThis is my opinion, I hope others agree with a part of it xd.","replies":[{"poster":"Snow Taradien","date":"2015-03-16T15:30:51.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love alllll of these suggestions.

He has almost no lane presence and his kit is extremely punishing if he stays in lane and doesn't collect his chimes. This leaves his ADC stranded most of the time in a 1v2 lane. His CC is extremely unreliable and his ult is only good for catching up to people. Bard on my team has gotten me killed many, many times already with his ult in teamfights. Every Bard that I've seen dies at least a few times while roaming around for his chimes, but his damage is almost non-existent until he has a ton of them. His E is very underwhelming and doesn't stop the enemies from catching you anyway","replies":[]},{"poster":"1CarneAsadaPLS","date":"2015-03-27T22:11:19.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His passive needs a stronger Xp and mana boost,more chimes need to spawn more frequently,and if an enemy stands on his \"w health shrime\" ability it should stun and do dmg.His ultimate should make allies champions invulnerable(and still be able to attack) and stun enemy champions,because it can either delay or get kills on rare cases help enemy escape.Should become invulnerable when passing through his magical journey and I hate when enemies get to use it.His \"q\"needs a AOE and the stun's the only good part about it with a faster (beam light) becuase it travles to slow for enemies to avoid it.And W cost way too much mana,I feel like im not helping out my team when I HAVE to go collect chimes for mana.And finally he's  the squishiest champ ever,if the enemy team gets me im 99.99% dead,not even my ult can save me because it'll stun me too. Life steal seems to do more healing than bards healing shrimes.    In overall I would like to reduce mana cost for healing shrimes,reduce to 3 sec charge for extra healing and increase overall healing.Cosmic Binding needs AOE with faster spell travel ,Passive need to provide more Xp and mana,and long speed boost,make magical journey unusable to enemies,and make his ultimate make allies champs Invunerable,heal,and provide speed boost.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Teemo N4","date":"2015-03-27T01:01:01.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bard is such a bad champ, That I would LITTERALLY BAN HIM FOR MY TEAM'S SAKE as in any trolls and newbs with bard who pick them on my team. I've never won a game with bard at all, because of how crap he is, only thing he has is a stun and thats it. He is a utility character that is basicly won't wont do damage and his stun never lands in most games. Bard should have more range for his poke, skills for his poke, magical journey needs a passive or secondary effect for ap users, otherwise he has 2 abilities that are useful and 1 for poke (his passive is a joke). His ult is bad because it instead does more damage to your team than them and are only useful against people who are doing baron or champions that recently field ulted like fiddlesticks, and rammus. Another problem is bard ult is a benefit for both teams as it provides cooldown time in the middle of it and save some people from obliteration. Honestly buff bard so I dont have to waste time dodging and bans on him please!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arenvalde","date":"2015-03-24T09:41:40.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bard's abilities are RIDICULOUS fun! Chain stuns, mystical journeys, throwing peeps at people's heads, freezing Baron Nashor. So much fun!\n\nAgainst bots.\n\nOn the other hand, NONE of his abilities work in the real world. The delay on his Q and R, the way Q seems to prioritize minion targets, the passiveness and HUGE delay on his heal, and the ridiculous mana cost on his heal make him awful in pugs. Frankly, NO ONE ever gets hit by Bard, much less killed.\n\nYour adc will ignore your shrines. Except the ones you drop to help the jungler, or the ones you place for yourself. Those he takes.\nYour Q will only ever stun bots or when you're running away 2v4 and a couple of them intercept it so that Riven can keep chasing. It telegraphs so much, Samuel Morse is jealous. Mostly, you use it to slow minon waves.\n\nYour Mystic Journey will be ignored as much as your Shrines are, except by enemies, who thank you for giving them a way to cut off your fleeing adc. And since you're running off to collect chimes like an ADHD golden lab on a squirrel farm jacked up on coke and speed, your team is never with you to use it for ganking.\n\nYour R is only useful for turrets because everything else in the game simply walks slowly out of the area. Ashe with no boots doesn't even care about your R. Katarina wonders why you just froze that spot she was at 10 kills ago. It's so slow, Baron Nashor has time to walk out of range.\n\nThe stupid \"collect the items\" sub-game encourages poor play choices, and since your ganking potential is worse than just about any other champ, you never actually roam to other lanes, just to collect chimes.\n\nThe little meeps you throw at enemies heads? Appear on a SLOOOOW cooldown (unless you play the chime minigame a LOT) and only ever seem to be around for clearing minion waves. I don't want to have to stare at my debuffs to make sure I'm not making a poor choice by AAing.\n\nReally what it comes down to is that playing Bard is picking an underpowered champ you have to babysit.  There is SO MUCH to keep track of.  W cooldowns, Shrine charge times, predicting the flow of lane to decide where to place shrines, watching minimap to note chime spawns, watching meep respawn timer, lining up meep hits so the aoe slow doesn't just whiff at nothing, setting up a successful q (never happens), remembering that the q hitbox is EVEN SHORTER than the graphic- which is too short already, scrolling across the map to make sure E is actually lined up and won't drop your allies in a gank situation or on the wrongs side of a wall, predicting where/when to drop your R because it's so slow.\n\nSuggested changes:\nConsider scaling on something other than AP\n\nChimes:\nBetter spawn locations, faster to scale with (less chimes per upgrade, faster spawn, w/e).\n\nMeeps:\nToggle.  Put it on Tab, T, A, G, C, or V or something, but let the player toggle meeps off so you can save them for champs.\n\nQ:\nHardest skillshot in the game atm.  Speed the missile and increase the range.\nEven better yet, make it NOT a skill shot.  Have it be an on-click ability that slows the target, and if it hits a wall or another unit, before or after the target, both units are stunned.  Also, if it hits a wall FIRST, it should still stun the target.\n\nW:\nFaster charge-up time, especially at higher levels.  Better scaling.  Increase AS for unit healed.\n\nE: \nMore forgiving pathways.  Let it vary by ~10° from where you aim it to make the longest path.  If you're travelling through really close to the edge of the wall, let players leave it early.\n\nR: faster missile.  If allies AND enemies are hit, freezing on allies lasts .5-1.0 seconds less.","replies":[{"poster":"Snow Taradien","date":"2015-03-24T12:01:33.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep yep yep.
