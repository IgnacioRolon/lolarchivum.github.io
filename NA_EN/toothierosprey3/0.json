Most champions can solo dragon using that build/runes/shit.\n\nLee has lifesteal on his W. In combination with his shield it helps keep healthy compared to most junglers.\n\nHis runes are very standard, except the CDR glyphs which are needed to pull this off. But against full AD compositions CDR glyphs are the most optimal choice anyways, and while missing MR hurts against teams with AP threats grabbing CDR is not a bad tradeoff.\n\nHis masteries sure are fk'd. However I could not resist testing this for myself. As I suspected his adaptation of the masteries are completely unnecessary. Using those runes and 9-21-0 masteries you can still level 2 drag the same way he did. I imagine 21-9-0 can work too but I went with defensive because most deep offensive tree masteries don't help on monsters.\n\nBesides if you reread my previous post I was only talking about Lee in a very general sense. His jungle sustain is strong and it's keeping him very relevant while many other champs like Eve or Wukong just die in the new jungle. This level 2 drag kill only demonstrates it very well.","replies":[{"poster":"Joe Dredd","date":"2014-12-21T18:42:39.635+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"5 % really is nothing early game.","replies":[{"poster":"Baron Von Bangin","date":"2014-12-21T20:36:52.929+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Enough to solo the dragon at level 2 it seems.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2014-12-21T06:55:56.103+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"He has between 3% and 8% lifeteal and spellvamp in that vid, depending whether iron will is active.\n\nI tried the same with Aatrox, didn't nearly work that well until level 5.","replies":[{"poster":"Joe Dredd","date":"2014-12-21T18:47:11.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Did you have your red bar full?","replies":[{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2014-12-21T19:40:03.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, but I think If i didnt take lifesteal mastery and I could have taken more AD for more heal.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2014-12-21T09:13:30.707+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":"Im not suprised Lee Sin can do drag at level 2.

A gap closer to allow him to slap down that slow.\nHow the heck does Nunu have better CC exactly?\n\nFiddle's has an AOE silence and a fear, so pretty equal but he is squishy.\nWW does more damage only if he builds damage, if he builds full tank, he does just as much damage as anyone else because he relies entirely on his AA's and Q to do damage. I won't bother churning out the math, but a full tank WW does less damage than a full tank Lee sin.\n\nIrelia is not more OP than Lee, get off the crack.\nDiana clears faster but not by much.\n\n\nEdit: Furthermore, same argument was used for Pantheon, and they nerfed his clear speed and made dragon bypass shield.
