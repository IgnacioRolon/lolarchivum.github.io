I have the larger one set to my primary, but when i open league, the game only fills my larger monitor to the size that it would be fullscreen on the smaller monitor. I can use windows shortcuts to expand it to fill the scree, but the highest settings i can put the graphics to is 1440 and it looks like shit. How to i get the game to fill the larger monitor and keep the graphics at 1920/1080?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-24T02:23:02.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the highest resolution available is the resolution of the smaller monitor, it sounds like your pc is still detecting the smaller monitor as the default/primary one.
