Long story short I received an honor capsule which contained Warwick among other things.  \r\n\r\nI hate warwick with a passion...   No worries, I'll just refund him... but its not even an option since I didn't actually purchase him...\r\n\r\n\"Then just don't play him...!?\"  \r\nYou're silly.  I play a LOT of arams... its a very popular gametype that many people actually PREFER over Summoner's Rift.  You should check it out!   :-)  \r\nEven when WW was just a free champ it was annoying AF but now I will ALWAYS have the option of getting him/wasting my hard earned rerolls to get rid of him.  It wouldn't be that big of a deal but now I'm afraid to open other honor capsule's/loot because I don't WANT any of their \"gifts\".\r\n\r\nThey have placed me into a lose/lose situation where I have to play a champ I don't like AND I no longer get loot... or get it at a high risk to my level of fun.\r\n\r\nI bought the champs that I wanted to play and Riot in their infinite glory has decided that my champ pool is wrong. \r\n\r\nAny help or suggestions with regard to refunding this and any future unwanted champions?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-10T04:46:40.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like you got pretty lucky and ended up getting Grey Warwick from that capsule. Honor capsules have a pretty rare shot at giving you either Grey Warwick or Medieval Twitch, as well as the champion if you didn't already own them. \n\nIf you want, hit up our agents in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) letting them know that you don't want Warwick on your account. As long as you're okay with having him removed, they'll be able to make it happen, but there most likely won't be any take-backsies (meaning you won't be able to request to have him added back)!","replies":[{"poster":"LuvGunn","date":"2018-01-11T02:09:19.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you!

We can all understand the feeling of getting stuck with champions we don't like at all in ARAM, but do keep in mind we won't be able to add champions back when they're removed like this.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2018-01-10T05:05:13.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would personally suggest that you keep him, especially knowing that you got the Grey Warwick skin! As Broporo said, it's a pretty rare skin. I have 795 skins, and no Grey Warwick in my collection yet! Also, as someone who has played well over 2000 ARAMs, I can guarantee you that he is an awesome champion to play in ARAM. I personally would love getting Warwick over many other champions if I had the choice in a match. I've owned all the champions for a while now, and always pick up the new ones shortly after I see them. It's fun to play a wide variety in ARAM! He's also very capable in other modes, and can really make a difference in how a match plays out.","replies":[]}]}
