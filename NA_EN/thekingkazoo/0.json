Every game i have done today i have had gotten gray screens. Early on tabbing in and out fixed it but now nothing works. Tried restarting client and it got me through one game without any issues after closing on loading screen. After that the bug became more frequent. In a five queue with my friends two remakes happened in 3 games. I saw there was similar issues back in April but i haven't seen anyone talking about it today.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-10-10T04:56:32.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Describe what you mean by \"Gray screen\", or provide a screenshot?
