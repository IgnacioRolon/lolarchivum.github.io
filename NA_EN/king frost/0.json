I'm running a a gtx 1080 with a Ryzen  5 1600x. I have league on an SSD.  I looked at online benchmarks and it says I should get around 200 frames but I'm getting around 70 with frequent drops to  around 40. My FPS doesn't go up when I lower the graphics , I get the same FPS on ultra that I get on low.  My Graphics card usage stays below 20 and none of the cores on the cpu approach 90.  I've done a fair bit of google but I'm at a loss.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2018-01-04T21:30:08.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your rig might be too good, so you may need to cap your frame rate via in-game option to help and disable v-sync.
