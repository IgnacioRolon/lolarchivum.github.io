After champ select, there is the loading screen with all the champion portraits on it. Instead of loading into the game, i reach a certain percentage while loading the game then it freezes. After freezing it completely makes me unable to tab out of the screen which makes me have to turn my computer off. I have encountered this in every mode, let it be customs or normal games. Any help with this problem is very much appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-02T23:13:22.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're running Windows 10, I definitely recommend [disabling the Windows Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html), as the anniversary update enabled a problematic feature called *Game DVR*. \n\nLet me know if that caused any change for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Zinski","date":"2016-10-03T00:44:31.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for taking the time to look at my problem, I very much appreciate getting help from riot itself.
