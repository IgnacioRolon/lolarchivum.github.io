Since you're also disconnected from chat, it looks like your network is having some problems getting a solid connection with our servers. \n\nLet's first look over some of your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to see if you could make a few adjustments that would give your network a smoother timing connecting with our servers.","replies":[{"poster":"Erika NPC","date":"2017-05-26T01:41:25.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh no, its not a network issue. It's just been like this ever since my first full ban after 5 years of playing. I've made support tickets asking and pleading riot for a restoration. usually in like a 6 month frequency. You'd figure after 2 years of silent reforming some would have taken enough notice to at least fix the account.\n\nEvery thing is accessible including the store and runes/masteries but chat and playing a game.\n\nits kind of like being on probation where its slightly jailing you and at the same time you can do what you want (sort of). Quite hilarious in my opinion. I've NEVER seen or heard of any one ever actually having the same problem. Genuinely banned accounts are practically inaccessible.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-26T01:54:36.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My bad for assuming the connection issue! I couldn't see that your account had been banned from those screenshots. \n\nAfter looking over your account, it does look like this was rightfully banned. There were numerous warnings sent and chat restrictions placed to help give you time to reform and rethink the things that were being said. After so many of them, the decision was made to place this ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Erika NPC","date":"2017-05-26T02:22:39.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, it was placed. I have no complaints about my lack of former behavior 2 years ago. Simply asking the community for votes. This forum link is already being shared beyond the forum. I just wonder till how many years I should have to wait because I refuse to play/make a new account.\n\nIf you don't mind sharing and casting a vote it'd be appreciated.\n\nI really love the new platform of the client by the way, really makes me want to play, now.\n\nI also have nothing to show for what I did to show my wrongs. All I get is this, https://gyazo.com/1ad3fbfb930bf814413062778b3699f1. Another strange thing. Says nothing about being banned, just chat restriction.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
