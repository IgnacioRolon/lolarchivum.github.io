My grievance is the inability to whisper someone like me with a space in their name without the /r function. Can we add something along the lines of  { /w \"malevolent loki\" Insert message here } please? \r\n\r\nIf there is already a way to do this can someone please enlighten me?","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2018-01-04T04:59:54.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've also had trouble with spacing screwing up the whisper function sometimes; I'm curious if trying to whisper to somebody by spelling the name WITHOUT spaces would maybe work consistently.\n\nAll this said, this is excellent feedback for developers but it's in the wrong place. I'd suggest hitting up the [**Client Discussion boards**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) to discuss improving chat's accessibility as well! :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chinchinchan","date":"2018-01-02T03:52:46.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For me, I just put the space in there and League does it properly.

Based on a few old posts I've read, some people suggested using /w \"Their Name\" message, or /w Their Name message, or /w Their_Name message; I would test this out for you and see which of them work, or maybe all of them do? But unfortunately, I don't have anyone to test this with! I hope one of these prove useful to you.","replies":[]}]}
