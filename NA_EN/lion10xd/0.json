You'll need to sign in from the [EUNE ](http://eune.leagueoflegends.com/)page first, then visit the PBE link. Log out entirely as your first step, then head over to the [EUNE ](http://eune.leagueoflegends.com/)page. Once there, the EUNE PBE link should get this resolved. Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
