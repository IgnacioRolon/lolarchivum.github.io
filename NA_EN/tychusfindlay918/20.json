Back in the very days of old the Nasus, Jax, Irelia, Warwick, Singed, and many more, were the larger and stronger threats than Marksmen. When late game hit and the enemy team had these types of champions and your team did not, it was a basic auto win for them. \n\nWhat they imposed late game was an impossible decision. You had to blow all your cool downs on that champion and lose because you had no CC or abilities to stop their Marksmen. Or you blow all your cool downs and CC on the Marksmen and lose because you had no way to stop the bruiser, fighter, diver, etc. Most Marksmen, even Vayne with 6 items, could not handle a 6 item Irelia alone for example. She would go \"honey badger don't give a shit!\" Chase her down and break her neck. The game was based around Marksmen not being able to solo many classes, even a lot of Vanguards but that was all thanks to 6th item broken Thornmail when it did more damage to the Marksmen. It was the damage the Marksmen added with the team, like with the mage, and safe distance that brought tanky melee champions down, teamwork and such. Which is why back then they needed peel.\n\nHowever Riot didn't want top lane carries anymore so they nerfed them, placed CDR on every item so blowing abilities doesn't hurt, and buffed Marksmen. Top lane and jungle carries got a triple nerf which removed them from the game. The only jungle carry there is is Yi and even then he has to be very careful late game or else he will instantly explode. Though his split pushing is nasty and erases towers fast.
