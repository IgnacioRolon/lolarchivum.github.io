Gets a tempo advantage and I have to play safe. I eaqualize at level 3 under the tower. He missteps and I use my stronger level 3 to get a really good trade plus a tower shot. This gives me a huge temp advantage. The lane is starting to shove into him and he doesn't want to back because he loses TP, so he plays soft. Takes any cs he can with q and I get in his face and deny what I can while last hitting. \n\nIF I only last hit, when my wave hits his side of the the lane I have 9 casters and a cannon.
