I despise Irelia, Jax, Yas, Camille, etc etc, and even Trynd and Fiora, because they have to fuck up hard for you to beat them as an immobile champion, and at some point, they will just outscale and facetank. Essence Flare/Awakened Dragon just solidifies that cancerous shit even more.\n\nBut I do agree that tanks should be tankier - specially at 3+ items.
