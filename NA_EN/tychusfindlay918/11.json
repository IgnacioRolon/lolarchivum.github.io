Interesting definition of op you have there\n\nYes, Lee Sin still has trinkets, but that doesn't mean removing green smite isn't one of the largest indirect nerfs to literally any champion EVER. I hate when people say \"you still have trinket.\" Yes, I do, but that doesn't change the fact that they gutted the champion by removing green smite.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ok sure but why","date":"2018-03-11T23:44:42.094+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been saying this since the beginning of time: nerf base damage, increase scaling; it's the only way to keep tanks from shitting on every other class","replies":[]},{"poster":"WrÆth","date":"2018-03-10T18:28:13.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I agree that buffing R base damage is not the way to go, I don't see how buffing scaling is either.\n\nIf Lee is going to be pushed towards a more assassin/bursty playstyle then he is going to need greensmite back. If you notice, all assassins kits have 2 RELIABLE mobility/survivalist spells, or resets like khazix. The reality is that Lee can never be an assassin because half the time now without greensmite, if he goes in to burst someone he's pretty fucking boned being in the middle of 5 without anything to escape with.","replies":[{"poster":"Pæan","date":"2018-03-10T21:21:13.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"{{champion:35}} hmmm.
