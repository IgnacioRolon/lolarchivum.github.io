They are supposed to be the \"late game carry class\", but both their 3-item core (IE, Zeal item, lifesteal/penetration item) AND full build are the cheapest in the game right after supports (whose items have to be cheaper due to lower income). Mages, assassins, fighters, tanks - all need more gold to complete their cores and full builds. This shit is why we have a terrible meta of ADC+their 4 bitches where whichever botlane gets a lead is most likely to win, no matter the rest of teans,","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KekOfTheFinest","date":"2017-12-08T21:30:52.053+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rapidfire=2600g\nStattik shiv=2600g\nInfinity edge=3400g\n=\n8600 gold.\nADC 3 item spike.\nTrinity=3733g\nSteraks=3200g\nTitanic=3500g\n=\n10433 gold.\nA newer bruiser build being built for top lane.\nWhich one was the late game scaling again?\n300 gold on zeal items, and another 200 on ie would be fair, no?","replies":[{"poster":"DragonShea","date":"2017-12-08T21:36:25.442+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KekOfTheFinest,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1o9IxRAL,comment-id=0002000000000001,timestamp=2017-12-08T21:30:52.053+0000)\n>\n> Rapidfire=2600g\n> Stattik shiv=2600g\n> Infinity edge=3400g\n> =\n> 8600 gold.\n> ADC 3 item spike.\n> Trinity=3733g\n> Steraks=3200g\n> Titanic=3500g\n> =\n> 10433 gold.\n> A newer bruiser build being built for top lane.\n> Which one was the late game scaling again?\n> 300 gold on zeal items, and another 200 on ie would be fair, no?\n\nyeah when ADC's get their late game at 2 items then stands to reason they they need a raise in cost.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TFBaam","date":"2017-12-09T00:18:22.379+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Who builds Trinity Steraks Titanic as their first 3 items? {{champion:41}} ?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sun Wu Ryuumoku","date":"2017-12-08T19:21:12.574+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":">I know those probably feel like small nerfs to you, but hitting all those items at once would almost certainly dumpster the marksman class.\n\ni have no issue with this !!\n\nU (adc players) had ur play times, now its over !!! {{sticker:darius-angry}} \n\n>These numbers are closer to truly balanced than you think, and that's a big part of the reason that Riot is cautious when making changes to them.\n\n\nThis isn't true... mainly with marksmen build cost.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sasogwa","date":"2017-12-08T21:08:03.914+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KempyreanPirate,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1o9IxRAL,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-12-08T16:27:47.266+0000)\n>\n> I know those probably feel like small nerfs to you, but hitting all those items at once would almost certainly dumpster the marksman class. \n> \n> This game gets a lot of shit for being way out of whack, but people ignore it when a -3 base AD nerf actually works and brings a champ back into line.
