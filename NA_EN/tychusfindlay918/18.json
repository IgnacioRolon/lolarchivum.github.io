I have fought a few darius's since the new patch and they are annoying as Fuck to fight against. Got one down to around 100 hp and his combo is fun isn't it. Think it truly depends on who is playing what. Not seeing people demand a Singed Buff for when someone picks a Quinn into him. Mundo is fun to play against a vayne. The problem with buffing Darius is he already has an overloaded kit. If he pulls you in you either flash or lose half your hp and then continue to lose more as you bleed. Add into the fact that Press the Attack on Darius is fun to fight. Pull auto W auto auto Q ult grey screen.

Take how you felt about darius, and that's how darius feels about fighting any ranging champ, or any melee that can face take and/or kite him, i.e., yi (facetanks), riven (good ones can kite and bait out a q before all-inning a dar. A good riv usually beats a good dar because of flexibility in her kit and ability to exploit darius's weaknesses and negating his strength...if she's good). Also, new udyr rips dar a new one every time in a 1v1 past like lvl 11.","replies":[{"poster":"Xion The XIV","date":"2017-11-15T03:07:28.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"but isn't that the point? All melee are weak to ranged. All ranged are weak to assassins. All assassins are weak to tanks. Isn't that what it is supposed to be?

Dar is supposed to beat almost anyone he gets his hands on in extended trades because he has a low mobility, low initial damage, low range, and high counterplay. If he grabs an ADC he should murder it, if he fights an udyr he should honestly have out play potential (hint, udyr has no true out play mechanics, he either he catches you and stat checks you, or he doesn't and probs escapes). Darius is the type of champ that should be supremely powerful at his strengths since on the other end there is the ability to cc and kite him so he does no damage at all. Heck even when dar is ahead he's not nearly as busted as zed, trust, fizz, akali, or any of those snowbally champs. Needs ghost, flash, and deadmans just to catch people or escape, and barely even gets to use his q heal to decent effect anymore. He's Garbo against towers and monsters unless you go the only viable preseason build so far, which is tri force and steraks gauge. Even his stat buffs we're subpar compared to other champs. With resolve tree and health stacking runes and all, he hardly gets more ho boost then the average mage got just from the general buff (something like 8-10 per lvl plus 10 more to start). I can honestly say he's hardly even outstanding in any area except sometimes in life elo. Easy to gank too. This guy's needs buffs lol. Maybe allow q to reduce time before activation by lvl or by kill until it's instant like old Darius and buff q to sliw AS again or something. Also, needs a slight ult buff to make up for loss of fervor of battle.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-11-14T18:34:07.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does no one check the red tracker?
