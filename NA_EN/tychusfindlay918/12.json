His healing is 100% bullshit and relies merely on being somewhat near things that die (regardless of whether he damages or kills said things). Were he not on the weak side, people wouldn&#039;t turn a blind eye. Thankfully, trundle is a troll pick right now (LUL).\n\n{{champion:266}} undodgeable (procs on hit every 3rd auto), no need for interaction with enemy laner, full heal is available on anything he auto attacks.\n\n{{champion:420}} dodgeable, must interact with enemy laner for heal by hitting a tentacle slam. Missing % (Strong at low hp and non existent at high hp).\n\nConclusion: the healthiest methods of healing would logically seem to be the ones that mandate or at least incline champions towards interacting with the enemy laner. Champions like akali and maokai prove incredibly frustrating as their sustain has very few drawbacks and no &quot;Weaknesses&quot; in the sense that they don't have to land a skill shot or have to attack an enemy champion to gain access to the full heal. Chogath left out (I got lazy). Nasus is bareable only in the sense that his healing is tied to his damage, and his damage early game is rather pitiful. Post sheen however his sustain methods are just as unhealthy as akali and maokai's.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2018-01-29T07:11:40.268+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"We already know this.\n\nRiot already knows this.\n\nThey don't care.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rootlo","date":"2018-01-29T14:30:52.129+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Maokai has to wait 20 seconds, or get smacked with spells to be able to use his though.

While more gameplay-laden heals aren't exempt from their own issues (Illaoi's heal in particular tends to make her even more binary relative to the situations she's in), their problems usually boil down to balance rather than fundamental design. This also goes to show that Akali isn't the only one with \"free\" healing, as a great deal many other champions also get sustain that acts as extra health regen in lane, with all of the associated gameplay issues that healing generates.\n\nBecause healing operates by negating damage, I agree with the OP that any source of healing needs to entail a legitimate cost or risk, and should encourage interaction rather than enforce passivity. Because of this, I think a baseline rule that should be applied to healing is that **it should not trigger on minions**. Champions are obviously fine, assuming the amount of interaction is proportionate to the amount of healing received, and large monsters are also usually fine on most (but not all) champions, but whenever healing gets to be applied indiscriminately on anything smaller, it tends to feel cheap and unfair as a result. Being forced out of lane purely because the enemy champion got to out-sustain you on just minions is a shitty feeling, and generally wars of attrition and noodle fights are situations Riot has tried very hard to move past.\n\nI also think that, to some extent, the excessive reliance of many top laners on reliable self-healing is a major reason why many of them can't duo lane: in top lane, where your opponent is usually (hopefully) melee, healing from minions typically involves little risk, and as a result champions with self-healing tend to have their staying power in lane balanced around it. When it comes to laning bot, however, where suddenly you end up against at least one ranged opponent capable of zoning you from the creep wave, those champions suffer tremendously as a result, because they become incapable of sustaining themselves without losing even more health to harass in the process. This is also why ranged top laners tend to feel bad to play against, because their ability to deal damage without approaching their target counters even the cheapest of minion-based sustain. It's a bit like an arms race, where champions who lack free self-sustain suffer against those who have it (especially if they're manaless too), and where both suffer even more against champions who have access to cheap poke in lane. Making self-sustain more conditional, and thereby potentially more apt at sustaining melee champions in proper PvP combat, would break at least one level of that arms race, and thereby potentially make top lane a much more interactive (and overall just more active) place.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2018-01-29T19:38:32.270+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"A few points I'd like to make:\n\nAkali's healing was intended for midlane.
