There's literally only one that you listed which viably is effective Vs Yi, and even he can be cured of his control: {{champion:90}} \n\n{{champion:111}} : Has an immobile, but requires you to be able to auto attack which proc's Yi's Ginsoo's full stacks. Once your short root is out, Yi will just delete you with Conquerer. Furthermore, if you Ult him, he will Alpha Strike as soon as it is about to hit to enter Unstoppable status. While theoretically he has CC that could hurt Yi, that's just not how it works out.\n\n{{champion:89}} : While her kit is almost entirely stuns/roots, they are all short, and Yi knows exactly when to Alpha Strike vs Her: strafe to the side of her R to only take the slow (which he's immune to on ult), Q vs her Q, and face tank her E. If Yi does this, she's dead dead dead. (and good Yi's do this vs Leona)\n\n{{champion:32}} : His ult is completely mitigateable with Meditate (Ult only stops attacks and movement, not skills). Futhermore, he lacks the outright damage to erase Yi. In the time it takes Amumu to charge a Tantrum, Yi can kill him 1 1/2 times. Yi also has a super easy time dodging Amumu's Q, if he wanted to.\n\n{{champion:516}} : You're dreaming. Brittle's tiny knockback does nothing to Yi, and E is extremely unreliable, because it has a windup in which Yi ALWAYS will Alpha strike to that it misses. Ornn's ult is useless vs him as well, because he's immune to slows. He occasionally can hit a random E knockup if he times it right.\n\nAnd what ALL those champs have in common: None of them can kill Yi solo. Although they have a cc kit, none of them have outright damage to kill Yi. They require teammates.\n\nThere's very few champs that actually counter Yi, and some of them are pseudo counters: \n\n{{champion:26}} (will disrupt Yi's Ult by not actually being a death)\n{{champion:19}}  (well timed Fear throws off ult, and allows WW a window to kill him. Doesn't work well at all when Yi is fed though.)\n{{champion:23}} (Ult carries him through Yi's Ult)\n{{champion:17}}  (Blind)\n{{champion:44}} (If he can manage to get his own ult off)\n{{champion:72}} {{champion:107}} \n{{champion:80}} (can block hits, hardstun, large single skill damage)\n{{champion:203}} (Ult can save and has an insanely strong early game which stays with her the entire game).\n{{champion:24}} (Auto attack bane)\n{{champion:74}}\n{{champion:105}} (If he hits Trickster, since Yi can't alpha untargetable targets)\n{{champion:245}} (Good assassinate kit if he hits his shield zone)\n{{champion:201}} (if with team can ensure pretty reliable stuns that are long)\n{{champion:63}} (Good at killing linearly running aggressors; might die in the process though, as Brand's big damage has a brief delay)\n{{champion:1}} (Stun nuke and has a % damage reduction on her shield which can barely sustain her through Yi's Alpha).\n{{champion:84}} (Broken self sustain, and Yi can't hit targets hidden by smoke)\n{{champion:103}} (can Ult over walls to avoid him, and poke him once his ult is wasted).","replies":[{"poster":"Mhihnj","date":"2018-04-29T10:49:02.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"play fiddle sticks.
