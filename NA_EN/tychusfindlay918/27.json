It slightly defeats the purpose of grounded if the accompanied slow is so strong might as well be rooted.\n\nOn the other hand a slow is currently the way they communicate to you that you are grounded.

It can still be used as a catching tool, but it can still give you a little room to understand you've fucked up. For example if they made nasus wither slow lighter, they could proceed to add the grounded effect if you're in his spirit fire/ult. He either A. early on burns through tons of mana for the combo, or B. basically preps to all in and bash your face in if he was in your face when he started the combo","replies":[]},{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2017-09-19T14:16:53.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about the grayed out icons and the inability to use them?
