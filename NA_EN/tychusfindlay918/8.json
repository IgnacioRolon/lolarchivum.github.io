Are you serious or delusional?  When I watch streamer and even myself play aram with this matchmaking putting diamonds plat in my game I don't see anyone raging OMFG this Ziggs is soo annoying to deal with. No They adapt with their build, they build the items that actually counter MAGES, mages is soo easy to counter yet you're still complaining about them never running OOM. Yea because there's clearly a way for them to get Mana when they reach 0 mana. You cannot Back in ARAM, meaning you can't regain Mana in any form or WAY, RIOT removed all the tools that let champions sustain other champion MANA, like removing Soraka E Mana, Gragas W that used to give mana, their answer was to give everyone infinite amount of mana sustain.\n\nAnd another thing with DOTA 2, some heroes can actually regenerate their mana meaning they can sustain themself.\n\nAnother thing, you're level 38 never played aram for a long time, with 78 upvotes and comes to the board to complain because of one match in ARAM? Are you serious?  Are you not ADAPTING TO THE GAME? Is it too fast paced or too complicated?\n\nLet me give you another exemple, lets say every mage is like INVOKER and would oom after 3 spellcast but 1 shot every champion no matter if their a TANK, SUPPORT, ADC, FIGHTER, BRUISER, JUGGERNAUT. Think again before commenting and look at every face of your coin. Every Dota heroes are broken even if they go oom after 3 spellcast. so STFU and sit down.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Acheron16","date":"2018-06-03T23:33:35.485+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Warmogs was busted before, some tanks like Alistar or Amumu only needed to buy it and become unstoppable. No two ways about it, it needed a change.\n\nBut now? Tanks have become garbage tier, alongside stuff like Evelynn and Udyr. Their only play style now is to serve as meatshields and bodyblock stuff for poke comps OR diving machines if the team has weak poke. That's it. They only dive non-stop or serve as buffers for their team.\n\nBefore you could go in, make some picks, backout and regen HP, ready for the next fight.\nNow, you go in deep, try to soak up as much as you can and try to distract the enemy as much as possible to allow your team to clean up. If you somehow survived the fight, you are now completely useless and you should just dive as soon as possible in order to buy stuff and recover HP.\n\nWarmogs should return, with a nerf that only allows you to regen 60%. Removing it just made poke comps even more obnoxious than they were.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2018-06-03T00:34:03.704+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"No. The item was fucking cancerous.\n\nIt's been in ARAM way too fucking long.\n\nA tank should not be unkillable to any forms of DPS or burst simply because buying one item lets them coast through the entire game, completely shrugging off **all** incoming damage until they run out of turrets or win.\n\nNobody else gets to heal back *all* of their damage taken while cowering.","replies":[{"poster":"Tychusfindlay918","date":"2018-06-03T17:47:15.971+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DuskDaUmbreon,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HcRwXcVI,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2018-06-03T00:34:03.704+0000)\n>\n> No. The item was fucking cancerous.\n> \n> It&#x27;s been in ARAM way too fucking long.\n> \n> A tank should not be unkillable to any forms of DPS or burst simply because buying one item lets them coast through the entire game, completely shrugging off **all** incoming damage until they run out of turrets or win.\n> \n> Nobody else gets to heal back *all* of their damage taken while cowering.\n\nAnd nobody else besides mages get to fling their shit off cooldown ALL THE TIME because clarity exists.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hhaavviikk","date":"2018-06-03T11:06:05.406+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm conflicted, on 1 hand some champions need it so they aren't hot garbage untill they get warmogs, on the other hand it is no longer frustrating facing a soraka and act as a teamwide warmogs by keeping everyone at max health","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mr Dalloway","date":"2018-06-03T01:03:40.412+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't miss it at all.
