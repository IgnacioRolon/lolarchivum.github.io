Riven has few matchups that she outright gets dominated early to late, however most matchups have ups and downs which overall balances her rather well. So if you took away her strengths against tanks (outscaling them hard in the sidelane) then you'd have to buff her elsewhere - ESPECIALLY as it's pretty safe that Riot is going to decrease the game length which would make Conqueror nerfs even more impactful.

And distinct power curves as well.\n\n\nI disagree, I think hard-counters is an outdated concept that is too frustrating - differing powerspikes makes matchups exciting as both sides have win conditions they can play to rather than simply getting shrekt early and knowing that it won't get any better over the course of the game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"heroikc","date":"2018-07-09T16:15:11.646+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":3,"body":"It's too toxic against tanks, even if they try to build armor.
