All the duelists in this game can just beat him outright.\n\nAs a mage, use your CC buttons/bait his shield. Just kill him if you're playing someone like Vlad, Morde, or Rumble.\n\nAs an assassin, depends on who you're playing, but you can do your flashy bullshit and outplay him that way, as kit-wise he's relatively straightforward.\n\nAs a tank, CC him and press /laugh. He shouldn't be able to kill you unless you're trying to stand there and duel him for some reason. He has to fight on your terms at all times.\n\nAs an adc, don't stray from your team ever.
