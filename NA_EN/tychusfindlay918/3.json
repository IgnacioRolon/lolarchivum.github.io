OK I guess, at least chogath has to meet certain conditions like execute champs or neutrals.\r\n\r\nNow you want to add it on swain. OK I guess in the sense that swain has to meet certain conditions to (pull souls). But what the fuck? This is a niche thing originally ONLY for sion, now for 3 champions. I think the change is fucking garbage, there's certainly other ways to buff swain that doesn't erode some of the more unique aspects of other champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Kanzler","date":"2019-07-03T02:51:53.213+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because with 145 champions, each with 4 abilities and a passive, you're going to have some overlap in kit mechanics.
