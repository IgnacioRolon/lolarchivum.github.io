This is nothing new. However vs certain other top lane matchups she sucks hard. Old Akali, despite her dashes, used to cuck Cassiopeia(doesn't appear so now) when she went top lane especially because of it being a longer lane. Now she loses to cheese picks and Kled, Wukong, Maokai, Olaf, and Galio. All of which aren't played that often. Cassiopeia will of course trump Juggernauts. They can't move very fast, and don't have ways to close the gap on her. So if people are picking Juggernauts top super often, she's going to abuse that.
