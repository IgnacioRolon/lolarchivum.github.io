The arrow hitbox is significantly wider than its animation.\r\n2. The arrow hitbox does not begin at the point of the arrow. It often appears that the point completely misses, yet the center of the body hits someone\r\n\r\nI do not feel that the arrow hitbox is actually too big as far as the balance goes. It's just the arrow visual often looks like it has missed, the point goes past, the it hits you from the side of the body of the arrow as you sidestep. But please make the arrow head like wider or something so that **it actually looks like it hit the things it stuns**","replies":[{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2016-10-24T01:40:10.172+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look at a champions shadow when you consider if an ability should land or not. The camera angle can be weird and mess with the 2d plane the game decides these things based on.\n\nThe shadow usually represents what a champion hitbox actually is but not always. If you do Lee's dance animation he will jump all over but his shadow will stay where his hitbox actually is. The same happens with some champions walk animations to a lesser extent.\n\nAlso the spectator client has some bugs in it with showing what happened in the game sometimes.","replies":[{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2016-10-24T05:19:19.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Needs more upvotes","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MunchCrunchLunch","date":"2016-10-24T02:04:22.124+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"about as accurate as thresh Q hit box is. that one is even more wonky. u can find wrose things for example mf and koz ults can still tick even if u get out of their range 1-3 times","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2016-10-24T02:31:01.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thresh's hitbox is fine.
