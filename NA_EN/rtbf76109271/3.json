People are going and telling him to kill himself in the comments on his youtube. DO NOT DO THIS, EVER. He doesn't deserve this for playing the game in a really dumb way and if you are reading this after leaving him a comment you are 100x worse. I deleted a youtube link since people were doing that. I meant this to be like an opinion thread, NOT A WITCH HUNT. \n\nLets look at the game I linked (one that went well enough which he decides to showcase it, so this is literally best case scenario) to see whats up. \n\nAt 4:00 (game time), singed comes to bot lane for the first time. His adc draven has only 5 cs, is 10% hp, and attempting to not get tower dived and get some farm. While the adc is farming at 10% hp, singed stands directly behind him at full hp. He moves further behind draven to avoid ashe w poke, letting the low hp, no farm adc tank it for him. Ashe gets greedy and tries to kill draven under tower and manages to die.\n\nAround 17:00, singed overtakes his adc in farm, who has nearly half the farm of ashe. His bot lanes turret was the first turret to fall. Note that akali has 8 kills for his team. \n\n27:00, singed has only participated in ONE kill, with no assists, no deaths. His only kill is ashe committing suicide under tower. His adc now has less farm than both junglers. His Akali now has 11 kills. Hecarim is getting items and now lots of kills too. The score reaches 20:25 before singed gets his 3rd kill participation\n\nRemember this is best case where they won the game, thanks to a fed af hecarim and akali. Singed does not die the entire game because he does not participate with the team. Now I want you to picture the games that are lost, and how that makes his teammates feel especially the adc. Look at how bad his adc did trying to solo lane in a game that they actually won and _even killed the enemy adc at lv3._\n\n**If you ignore the game, your team and the role you queued as, get banned.** and if you think otherwise, picture this:\n\nSomeone queues as jungle, they don&#039;t take smite, choose draven, then roam mid/top and just take farm without ever fighting any enemies. Would you report them for trolling? Would you be pissed? I would be, almost everyone would be, and that&#039;s why this guy is getting banned all the time. He is a detriment to his team in every way, from screwing the adc to ignoring the rest of the fights. Regardless of if he gets some really fed solo laners to win along side, this is against summoners code and must piss off virtually every team he plays with.\n\nVideo #2, they lose and pretty bad. His entire team is mad, mostly at him for what he does.** He then reports his entire team for intentional feeding, harassment and unsportsmanlike conduct.** The enemy team apologizes in post game lobby for his trolling on their team.

Singed420 was probably reported 100 times for inting, until they realized that his playstyle is effective, and that he is not inting but strategically suiciding.\nLink: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18vrv27O8fg\n\nBut it would be nice, if Adelheid would write in the game lobby what he will do, so that the adc knows that he has to be on his own for a large part of the game. So it will be hard for draven, but someting like a cait or ez could be on their own (or maybe even a lux, when there is a zed mid or somthing)\n\nGenerally i think it just needs a ton of games, till people realize a new play pattern. Probably at the begginings of leage, there was one guy going into the jungle, and the remaining top laner had to play against 2. and he flamed all game and reported, until after a few 1000 games now, it is the meta, because you win more games with it.","replies":[{"poster":"tea is sweet","date":"2016-11-16T20:16:18.442+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Singed420 doesnt queue as support and leave his adc 1v2.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Badmagick","date":"2016-11-16T21:46:48.689+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"The difference is that this guy is playing top. He queued for top (i assume), he got top, hes playing a top champ. That is a fine way to play singed, he generally is the only champ that ppl are ok if he suicides cause that's how u play singed.
