Big-time. Diving solo while down 2 levels with no vision or heal, then getting jumped on by someone *three* levels above.\n\nThat alone would have happened regardless of keystones or picks (as long as the jungler was damage-oriented). Only difference is that Ez would have taken a bit more damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rathar Dashing","date":"2018-10-12T04:21:10.282+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Graves was 3 levels above Jhin, Ezreal was 2 levels above Jhin, both had Dark Harvest Procs ready, and Jhin made an incredibly stupid move going where he did.
