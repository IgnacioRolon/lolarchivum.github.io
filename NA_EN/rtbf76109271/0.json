The way its worded implies three SEPARATE spells: procs on &quot;your third hit by attack or damaging spell&quot;\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s obviously not what happens and some abilities which hit every 0.25 seconds like {{champion:68}} flamethrower just thunderlords you before you could ever get out of them in time. Old {{champion:105}}  did it too. He would w-q and the DOT, flat magic damage and q would all count separately and thunderlords would proc with a SINGLE hit. Also {{champion:103}} w, if it doesn&#039;t hit minions and all goes on the champion.\r\n\r\nEveryone loves {{champion:134}} outplays where they hit you will &quot;three&quot; spells to get that thunderskills off. Pressing r on you is CLEARLY three separate spells right....... lol\r\n\r\nIf they desired to reduce burst in the game, I think re-coding this ability to be truly 3 different spells or different auto attacks WITHOUT counting passives it would be much better. A passive example is lux hits you with e + auto attack, that pops her passive for a &quot;third&quot; damaging spell and procs thunderlords after what really should be thought of as a spell + empowered auto for 2 stacks. \r\n\r\nIMO thunderlords should proc ONCE off of every spell cast ie pressing a qwer button. If you press the same key twice it could still count twice, like {{champion:101}} ultimate.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-29T01:25:30.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Low ELO problems.\n\nWorry about something actually serious.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf76109271","date":"2017-01-29T01:34:44.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To pull the low elo card shouldn't you play something other than ARAM and be actually ranked and higher than me? Ya I'm just an average player but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm wrong. \n\nThere are currently lots of threads and people talking about how burst and damage is too high. This kind of change could help address that as it would mean it takes longer to get a thunderlords proc for many champions","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-01-29T04:43:28.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game is a joke right now, ARAM is the only thing worth playing.
