I have been maining him through all his changes and love his play and feel. However with the recent changes, zed has been left behind. Now with league of tanks being popular zed's assassination potential has gone down the drain. Even urgot (who was already strong) got buffs. I suggest that you add armor pen somewhere into zed's kit. Also while you are at it nerf urgot.\r\n\r\n-a zed main","replies":[]}
