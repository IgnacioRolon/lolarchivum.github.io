How defenseless.\nYou're forgetting that the more people there are, the more you can dash around and avoid any skillshots.\n\nYou are tying to tiptoe around the fact that Yasuo actually has plenty of defense, it just takes someone who doesn't have brain damage not to mess them up. It's a common tactic when players main broken champions, they try to assume that everyone playing them is an utter moron who's too stupid to abuse them. And yeah, I've seen a ton of Yasuos who don't bother to abuse their practically-no-cd dash to avoid pretty much any skillshot coming their way. That doesn't make Yasuo not broken though. It just means it's possible to mess up with him.\nThe same arguments get used for Thresh. Thresh is not balanced because the players are too stupid to click his lantern.

You are comparing a directional ability that ONLY block projectiles to these skills.

Yeah, that's totally the same as an aoe spellshield that can protect half of your team for almost 4 seconds. If we're counting heals, how about all the free stats given to Yasuo that contribute to his ridiculous arpen and crit chance and as such increase his lifesteal?\n\nAnd really? Yasuo's spellshield blocks the majority of attacks. I like how you try and make it seem like it doesn't by emphasizing it blocks \"projectiles\", as if the vast vast majority of damaging abilities don't fall into that category. Yasuo's spellshield is also incredibly generous when it comes to timing, which is more than I can say for someone like Yi or Fiora.\n\nAlpha strike? You mean that half-a-second lasting ability which doubles as his gapcloser? Heal that roots him in place and makes him unable to do anything? Yi is in the worst state when it comes to defense. No-one is ever going to let Yi heal anything and killing him is for the most part a matter of just waiting for him to alpha strike and then throw all cc on him since his only engage is also his defense. Again, we are functioning on the assumption that the players have a brain and aren't bottom of the barrel bronze.\n\nAlso, I'm far from the only one \"set\" on him being op. There's a reason he's so massively abused and it isn't because you're the only special snowflake who knows how to handle his \"high skill floor\".","replies":[{"poster":"Robbit Mang","date":"2015-11-17T23:12:42.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I emphasize that it only blocks projectiles because yasuo is almost completely defenseless against any melee attacker who can get to him. Jax, Riven, Darius, Fiora, Renekton, Tryndamere, xin xhao, mordekaiser etc he gets completely steamrolled by, as his only option fighting them is to dash into them or onto creeps which are rarely nearby unless he is in lane. Annie and Leblanc counter him very hard even though he has windwall, because they do not care. It doesn't block a Viktor laser or a viktor ultimate etc, there are just so many abilities and champions who don't care. In my earlier post i said sure he is broken this patch 100% due to the crit chance changes and warriors bloodlust, he actually has a 53% winrate atm which is EXTREMELY high for what he's had.  Yasuo is 100% throw cc on him kill him instantly because all he has to defend himself is his one very good ability, once it's used you can EASILY take him out if you land your abilities. Granted I will 100% agree he is too strong this patch, before this patch him boasting a 48% winrate in plat+ where actually decent players are and not garbage silver/bronze where his entire lead comes from the fact that players are so bad they can't keep up with his CS may have shown he was in an ok spot.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-11-14T11:59:55.247+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While being one of the most popular champions.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Talkrr","date":"2015-11-13T04:32:06.569+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":34,"body":"Chill.
