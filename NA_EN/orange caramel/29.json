He gives plenty of opportunities to both his allies and opponents, and has a kit that isn't too overly focused on saving allies or stun-locking enemies, so he doesn't feel excessively frustrating even when he's played well.\n\nNami is another support who's generally well-liked by the Boards. She feels fair to play against, but also satisfying to play, and has a diverse array of tools that, again, lets her assist allies and disable enemies, but without ever shutting someone down completely at the press of a button.\n\nBy contrast, the major problem with many of the supports mentioned in the OP is that they frequently have this one button they press that can instantly shut down much more skillful plays. Enchanters typically have this problem due to an excessive portion of their power budget being placed onto on-demand shielding or healing, and particular champions like Lulu, Morgana, Thresh, Blitz, etc. are also notorious for having one CC ability that can easily stop certain champions from playing the game entirely. Mage supports tend to frustrate ADC players because their high bases and relative independence from scalings means they can easily deal a lot of damage in a squishy lane, which feels cheap, and it's especially irritating when these same mages also have damage that is relatively easy to apply, as has been the case for Brand and Malzahar in the past.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JustMonika13","date":"2018-04-09T16:49:01.159+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I enjoy fighting against and respect good Rakan and Nami players\n\nRespect to god Thresh players too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2018-04-09T17:12:39.734+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"excuse me?\n\nthresh lantern can be blocked, and if the dude is cc'ed he can't take it","replies":[]},{"poster":"z63XnLCMwX","date":"2018-04-09T16:47:01.609+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":10,"body":"{{champion:89}}","replies":[{"poster":"RakanButTHICCer","date":"2018-04-09T20:29:29.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seen,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vO37Q6u8,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-04-09T16:47:01.609+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:89}}\n\nwhy isnt this bumped?","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2018-04-10T02:20:54.303+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ever since they updated her lore, would not bump.\n\nIf I wanted to praise the sun, I'd just go play dark souls instead.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Athenes Lulu","date":"2018-04-10T08:38:00.731+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seen,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vO37Q6u8,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-04-09T16:47:01.609+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:89}}\n\n\"braindead tank just strictly press 3 buttons in a row and abuse hitbox and do absolutely nothing else\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"SooFr0sty","date":"2018-04-10T00:13:14.583+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Clear strengths and weaknesses","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sona Ping","date":"2018-04-09T21:16:09.322+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"~~The kind that doesn't do anything to stop them from winning the game.~~  Aw geez, I guess they must find those really healthy and interactive ones to be a good support instead of the unhealthy and uninteractive ones.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VICHEL CHAOS","date":"2018-04-09T22:07:54.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well, supports that cannot keep their carry alive on their own if a 7-0 assassin jumps on them would be nice for a starter.

Currently, if a well-played support cannot do this, they're useless, so bruisers literally cannot function the way they're intended to late-game.","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2018-04-10T19:46:52.036+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">but the real problem is that supports exist to make adcs immune to divers and assassins.\n\nThe problem is: ADCs are literally incapable of surviving otherwise.\n\nThere is *zero* counterplay to a Xin Zhao or a Zed as most ADCs, with the exception of being 5+ levels up on them (Which basically never happens: Assassins are in a solo lane and usually have the most early kills of the game, while ADCs are in a duo lane and rarely get solo kills). Xin dashes to you, knocks you up, does his weird-ass twirly stab thing, and autos one or two more times, and you're dead. There is no way to stop that from happening as just about any ADC. Vayne can if she has a wall to stun you into, but Vayne sucks with the shiv nerfs. Tristana can, with her entire kit, but she spends an ult to escape him, and he hasn't even used his smite yet.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2018-04-10T20:56:00.964+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"None. Supports by there very design are meant to enable allies and disable enemies. That's the entire point and appeal of a support. you interact with the game indirectly through other players.\n\nThe only people who don't bitch about supports are support players, because everyone else just sees them as a cockblock. _Even tho that's the supports job. _\n\nIt's like asking what is healthy for an assassin to the boards. No one finds them healthy because their job is to pick ppl off and no one likes being picked off.\n\nThe only state in which people won't complain about them is if we make them wardbots again.\n\nQuite frankly, the fact that people are actually bitching about supports is a good thing. It shows that supports have finally reached a point where they are actual champions, because previously they were essentially half champions. \nEvery champ in the game gets complained about otherwise. Every single one.\n\nPeople bitching about supports to a certain degree is actually healthy in this regard.","replies":[]}]}
