I was not stunned silenced or rooted at all.. Twice this action has happened however the final hit on 3rd attempt with his Q connected after i had to reposition myself to more of the central part of the nexus in between the 2 downed nexus turrets.. Im not sure if it is a glitch with his hit box on nexus which shouldnt be an issue since his Q is an enhanced auto attack.. Please look into this when u guys have the time..{{champion:86}}","replies":[{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2015-05-18T15:42:39.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ive noticed this on a few other champions who have an empowered auto attack ability also.","replies":[]}]}
