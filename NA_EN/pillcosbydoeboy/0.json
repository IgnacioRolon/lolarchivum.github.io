In this chat you were insulting someone by calling them a scrub and low elo, and you were threatening them with reports and a ban. While this alone isn't something that would get you permabanned, you had just come off of a 14 day ban for this kind of behavior which means you were on thin ice and this behavior is reportable.[ The punishment after a 14 day account ban is a permaban.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/yFLxpAcV-qa-about-player-behavior-systems-chat-log-reviews-and-feedback)\n\n> Since the system is automated there surely has to be room for a flaw. With that being said you can get reported by say 4-5 people and trigger it. All you have to do is all chat someone is being toxic and flaming you even though they aren't and trigger it.\n\nI did mention there was a tiny chance of false positives, but it is very tiny. This one example of the logs you are showing was not a false positive for the reasons I mentioned above. A review of your reported matches is triggered by report volume, but they are validated by the system and punishment is only given if it finds punishable behavior; more reports won't make the system change whether they were valid or not.\n\nIt's also important to note here that premade reports do not stack and cannot trigger a review more than a single solo report.\n\n> Threatening to Perma ban support singed\n\nPlease read this thread and the linked comment regarding the real reason he was punished (hint: it wasn't for playing Support Singed or not buying Sightstone); http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/79aGu3wR-support-singed-isnt-banable-but-thats-not-the-point?comment=006b\n\n> I've already submitted a ticket and I will be getting my refund tomorrow.\n\nIf you submitted a ticket to request a chargeback you probably don't know what a chargeback is. Riot won't refund you, an intentional chargeback in this case is when you scam Riot by having your bank or 3rd party payment company return the payment.
