I tried to reconnect again, but the game wouldn't load and I didn't get a second bugsplat. I waited and waited for about 5 minutes to see if something would happen, but it didn't. So I closed league via task manager since it wouldn't let me close it through right click on icon and there was no x since it was loading screen. I open league back up, sign in, and then it said that the game was a remake and that i was put into low priority que (I had to wait 20 minutes before going into the que for 5 games) I have yet to play any of those five games in hopes that I can be unbanned. I submitted a report in \"Ask Riot\" under \"Technical Issue\" however I do not know if that was the correct place to submit it, or if it was the correct catagory to submit it as. I also did not submit the bugsplat as I figured it would fix itself as it has in the past. Please tell me if there is the possibility of being unbanned and if I needed to submit the bugsplat in order to be valid for future reference. Thank you for your time and your feed back will be much appreciated. &lt;3.  {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}\n\nI was to laziy to actually change the body of the paragraph lol, so ignore the thing about where i should place it.","replies":[{"poster":"CatKitty3","date":"2016-11-15T01:56:42.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"happened to me aswell this was bullshit it would let you reconnect at all","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-15T04:49:00.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Regardless of intent, a disconnection negatively impacts *everyone in the match*, which is a key reason why they're all treated equally and why we cannot remove penalties.
