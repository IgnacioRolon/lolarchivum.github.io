It does, however, activate with Brand's passive. If it works with Brand's it should work with Twitch's as well. \r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Damage an enemy below the Dark Harvest threshold (which doesn't activate Dark Harvest).\r\n2. Wait for poison to deal damage.\r\n3  Dark Harvest does not activate as it should in specific example of Brand's passive.\r\n\r\nThis issue occurs 100% of the time. A further note is that this worked before patch 8.24 just fine. Please take some time to look into this I appreciate it!","replies":[{"poster":"Troll Slaiyer","date":"2020-02-03T20:22:36.048+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"make darius bleed trigger it too","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-02-03T05:51:19.224+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it resets the combat CD timer for Hail of Blades it should deal damage with Dark Harvest.

This means that it does not trigger spell effects including Dark Harvest. Not a bug, just not a necessarily intuitive interaction.

I guess I'm not confused on how it works, I'm just saying riot should change the way it works because as it stands the interaction is dealing damage to them while they are below the threshold and it is a separate instance of damage, which is the cited reason for allowing ludens to still activate it. Therefore they should treat it the same.","replies":[{"poster":"WTBeGirl100EUhr","date":"2020-02-05T21:53:21.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ludens applies spell effects.\n\nDoesn't really make the interaction more or less fair but that's the why I guess","replies":[]}]}]}]}
