Anyone have this issue and or know of a fix to it? It's not fps, as they stay fairly constant. This happens not only in teamfights, but in 1v1s as well. The first time it happened (Idk, about a month ago?) I just assumed my lane opponant was using a drop hack, but then the pingspikes started happening more and more.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-11T00:48:53.608+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It definitely sounds like this is an issue between you and the gameservers. Most of the time this ends up being one or more configurations on your local network that simply isn't compatible with League. Our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) will walk you through the most common solutions for this issue, so I don't think it would be a bad starting point in troubleshooting this.\n\nJust message me back if you happen to still see these issues after you've worked through those steps.","replies":[{"poster":"TootinScootin","date":"2017-01-18T15:25:05.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the help, Targon, but none of the troubleshooting thing seem to apply to me.

I'd like you to use [**WinMTR**](http://winmtr.net/) to run the traceroute log we'll need. After loading up the application, simply plug **104.160.131.1** into the host field and start the trace. After the trace has run for 5 minutes or longer, export the results as text and paste them in a reply.\n\nIf you run into any issues with this, let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"TootinScootin","date":"2017-01-27T16:31:54.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Here's the readout.](http://pastebin.com/SrUvv5S8) Thanks again for all your help :D I hope we figure out a solution.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-01T03:17:41.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like your issue is on the first hop outside your home network at the **99-70-252-1.lightspeed.rcsntx.sbcglobal.net** network hop, where your latency spikes to **316ms**.
