Checking in on the issue from time to time for periodic updates\r\n* Transfers are currently down\r\n\r\n**Server Stuff: **\r\n\r\n* **Automated alerts spike, causing MMR update delays (3/18, ~55 minutes)** A series of alerts on a database alert the NOC to possible delays with data transfers. Various data used by the client is taking too long to be stored and called by players. Teams on-call are paged to investigate, only to find the issue self-resolved before any investigation starts. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Game Stuff: **\r\n\r\n* **Sylas R Micropatch (3/20, ~9 hours)** Some crazy interactions between Sylas stealing Teemo’s ult lead to Sylas being able to open an all you can eat mushroom buffet. The flipside though was, he basically could then never ult anyone else for the rest of the game. \r\n\r\n**Player Support Issues:**\r\n\r\nWe’re seeing a large spike in issues happening in-game.[ Update your graphics card drivers](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes#wq2) (there’s a new set from nVidia recently).

Keep an eye on the timestamp of when your ban should be up.  Bans are lifted not only by a certain date, but by a certain time as well as the time zone given.

If that happens, all games on it never complete and aren't stored. We track those as games that don't finish properly, and can see when the number of games starting over a set time period don't equal the games that end from the same active ids. \n\nThose, along with Ghost Games, are pretty rare occurrences.

If you're on WiFi, that's far more likely than if you're on a wired connection.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RinzlerTR","date":"2019-03-21T22:50:37.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same Error of \"Trouble fetching information for (Account)\" Is this problem something that's going to bar me from trying to play Ranked anytime soon?
