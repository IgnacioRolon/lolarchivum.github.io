Thanks to those who took the time to make their vote!\n\n**Follow-Ups:**\n\n* None\n\n**Server Stuff: **\n\n* **Missions script cause delay to mission progress (3/2, ~44 minutes)** The NOC starts to see a delay in mission progress completion metrics. This also seems to coincide with a database running a cleaning script to free up space. When the script ended, the delay in mission progress mysteriously disappeared. Case closed Watson! \n\n* **Configuration change causes login errors (3/4, ~3 hours)** A configuration change causes log in errors to spike to 5% on average. Since that should be 0%, the configuration change was rolled back, and log in errors magically disappeared. Said configuration change enters review to figure out why it caused that, and delayed until fixed. \n\n* **Missions and Store Content Live Early (3/5, ~2.5 hours)** In the excitement of getting new Morgana and Kayle out, various content was toggled live before it was scheduled. The mistake was caught and content was toggled back off, waiting for the proper time to be set live.
