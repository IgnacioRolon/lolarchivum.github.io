Investigation leads to a 3rd party vendor having issues with API keys, leading to the increased failure rate. Worked with 3rd party vendor to fix API issue appropriately. \r\n\r\n* **Missions unavailable (4/23, ~3 hours)** A hardware update at a data center replaced various pieces of hardware. After the update, NOC noticed increased failure rates related to Missions and mission completion. Investigation led to an incorrect routing table on one of the new pieces of hardware installed. Updating the routing table fixed the issue, and errors returned to normal values.\r\n\r\n**Game Stuff: **\r\n\r\n* **Nope.jpg** \r\n\r\n**Player Support Issues:**\r\n\r\nThere’s a pretty stable amount of similar problems across the board in Player Support. We are also launching the new League Patcher, which should improve a bunch of things, as well as prevent you from needing to allow League through your firewall with each patch! Read about it [here ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015621174-New-League-patcher)and if you want to adjust your firewall one or two final times for the client, look [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3).\r\n\r\n_Morgageddon &amp; Couch Commando_","replies":[{"poster":"ÈvilMorty","date":"2019-04-25T21:33:22.888+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"Address things the player base has been asking for, Bans in aram, why champions do not get the nerf hammer that deserve to, why champions get buffs when they dont need it, why some champions are left in the gutter for ages, mobility creep, damage creep, itemization issues, matchmaking issues, ranked issues, why trolls dont get baned ect.","replies":[{"poster":"The23rdGamer","date":"2019-04-26T00:22:50.703+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ÈvilMorty,realm=NA,application-id=6WpmgL9O,discussion-id=2irOymfd,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-04-25T21:33:22.888+0000)\n>\n> Address things the player base has been asking for, Bans in aram, why champions do not get the nerf hammer that deserve to, why champions get buffs when they dont need it, why some champions are left in the gutter for ages, mobility creep, damage creep, itemization issues, matchmaking issues, ranked issues, why trolls dont get baned ect.\n\nAgain, these Rioters do not focus on balancing the game.

It can also prevent {{champion:412}} from taking an optimal path to land a hook in a fight or skirmish.
