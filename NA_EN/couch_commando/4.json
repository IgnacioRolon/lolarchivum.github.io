An update to the system fixed the issue and prevented items expected to be removed from staying behind.\r\n\r\n* **Update to Leagues causes Ranked issues (5/14, ~25 minutes)** An update to Leagues went live, and caused an increase of error messages. Before investigation could dig into what config changes caused it, levels returned to normal. \r\n\r\n* **Game servers freezing (5/14, ~ongoing)** Game servers on NA and LA randomly go into a failed state, unable to properly host games and communication attempts fail. Logging into the server takes excessive time, and diagnosing why this is happening is ongoing. Servers identified as entering a failed state are rebooted, and if unable to be rebooted, removed from the active pool for on-site diagnosis. \r\n\r\n**Game Stuff: **\r\n\r\n* **Finishers entitlements disabled (5/14, ~Ongoing)** Launching the Trials package included a finishing animation. This animation triggers epilitic seizures in some players, so itâ€™s been disabled until changes can be made to ensure there are no problems for players viewing those animations (or options to disable said effects). \r\n\r\n**Player Support Issues:**\r\n\r\nPatch 9.10 is out, as always, take a gander at [patching issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues) if you have problems patching!
