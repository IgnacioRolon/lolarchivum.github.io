We will follow up when we get any additional updates. \n\n**Server Stuff: **\n\n* **Account Transfers Disabled (5/23, ~10 hours)** PS reports account transfers are resetting players content and level to 1. Transfers are disabled globally and messaging is posted while a change list step is awaiting completion. Finishing the change list fixed the transfer errors, messaging removed and transfers are turned back on.\n\n* **Transferred accounts incorrect web data(5/24, ~2 hours)** Reports filter into the NOC detailing transferred accounts have issues on Boards, Community Events, and other web locations. Investigation leads to a core process having the wrong region set. Changing the core process to correctly denote regions fixed all the issues, and affected players start seeing correct info on the web again. Elise can sit in peace again. \n\n* **Slow Logins (5/27, ~20 minutes)** Automated monitoring notices increased delays with logins on various regions. NOC started to investigate login issues, only to see the errors self-resolve before any in-depth investigation could start. \n\n* **Account Transfers Disabled (5/25, ~ongoing)** Transfers are currently down, hopefully can expand the why in next week's GBL! \n\n**Game Stuff: **\n\n* **None this week**\n\n**Player Support Issues:**\n\nFriendly PSA: please make sure your account is secured as best as possible [here ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751664-Protecting-Your-Account)with these steps.
