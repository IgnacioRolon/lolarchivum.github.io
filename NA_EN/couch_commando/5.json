Here are a few Support Articles around Lag.  You can see if you can fix the issue on your end.  \n\n[Low Frame Rate](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005102387)\n[Troubleshooting Lag or Low FPS in the Updated Client](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115007595768)\n[Lag - Disabling Full Screen Optimization](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001500627)\n\nIf none of these help, then the next step should be writing in to Player Support for a deeper dive.   I don't see a Player Support ticket created on your end around this issue as far as I can see.  This is a good case where our PS agents can deep dive to see what the issue is. \n\nI hope this helps!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"exxpose","date":"2019-02-07T16:38:47.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When are you going to implement a toggable enable/disable Game Chat Box in the client?

He is supposed to be versatile and quick.  In and out.  Now.. you cant even go in.  He's actually so bad now that you might as well remove from game.  Give Rakan his speed back.
