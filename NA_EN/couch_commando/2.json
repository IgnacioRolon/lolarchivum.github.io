Take a gander [here](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/client/client-features/saved-login-credentials-coming-soon)! \n\n**Follow-Ups:**\n\n* **Mac voice still not working properly** Reached out to Apple for assistance (Looked into this, the core bug is still being worked on). \n\n**Ongoing**\n\n* **Avast causes players to disconnect (6/10, ~Ongoing)** NOC notices an increase in non-unique reconnects across all servers. Investigation and PS assistance leads to the discovery Avast updated and changed their runtimes, causing LoL to be recognized as a virus (we’re not, we swear). Currently ongoing with best way to fix this beyond disabling Avast.\n\n**Server Stuff: **\n\n* **Esports missions rewards delays (6/9, ~15 minutes)** The service missions run on starts to fail. Triage starts, and the root cause seems to be information not getting from Point A to Point B. Before they “why” could be found, the issue self resolves and information gets where it needs to without failing. \n\n* **F2P rotation swaps incorrectly (6/9, ~2 days)** F2P rotation is changed for the next patch. However, the back end settings of available champions doesn’t match the actual playable F2P champions. Investigation leads to the faulty procedure that caused it to not update properly. \n\n* **Circuit Breakers tripped(6/11, ~2 hours)** Monitoring systems notice a breaker graph spiking, followed by a circuit breaker tripping. Escalated to people on site, and was possibly related to DNS issues. Breakers were flipped and fixed, quite literally flipping a switch (with a whole lot of amperage running through them though). \n\n* **DNS issues affecting services(6/11, ~2 hours)** The circuit breaker tripping (from above) caused a DNS load balancer to die (gee, thanks Kennen). Re-enabling the load balancer fixed the DNS issues, and Kennen went back to powering the servers. \n\n* **DNS issues affecting services(6/11, ~30 minutes)** The changes to get the DNS load balancer back up and running caused chat issues, as well as other services getting impacted. Engineers investigated the fix, finding an infinite loop had been programmed as part of the fix. After removing the mathematical impossibility, the services recovered. \n\n\n**Game Stuff: **\n\n* **Nothing currently!** \n\n**Player Support Issues:**\n\nWe’ve got Morde incoming, so let’s be ready for those bug reports just in case! If you’ve seen a bug in the client or in game recently, follow the steps on the KB article [here ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005466327-Report-a-Bug)to do it.  \n\n_Morgageddon &amp; Couch Commando_","replies":[{"poster":"DABS Strange","date":"2019-06-13T23:10:36.671+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still can't play a game, since Friday the 7th. \n\nI load into the game fine, but about every 40-50 seconds, I disconnect and get a \"Attempting to Reconnect\" message that pops up.

I saw the notification, so I figured that must be the problem. I saw the post that stated if we were still having issues, to seek further help from Avast. So this morning I spent an hour on the phone with an Avast Support Technician, and they confirmed (through an app that gives them control of my computer) I don't have Avast or AVG on my computer. They were just as confused as I was, as to why I was calling them about a problem with Riot's game. They were willing to try and solve the issue, for a service charge of $80.

Even with a fresh computer, with only League on it, I still have the same issue. \n\nI've scoured this forum for help, the only answer I see are the disable Avast/AVG or add League to exceptions. Neither of those solutions work for me. I submitted a ticket on the 10th? Got one response telling me to disable Avast/AVG or add League to exceptions (sounds familiar...) and the next was an extremely generic and almost insulting \"Did you try unplugging your modem?\".
