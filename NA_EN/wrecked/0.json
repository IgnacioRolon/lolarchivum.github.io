V2, now with counter-arguments.","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"TL;DR at the bottom.\nSo, this has been an issue forever, and it really ties into the toxicity of the game as well. When you make a new account, and play a game, even as a fresh level 3, you'll see at least 60% of players in that game are smurfs. And that's really lowballing it. I've tested it a lot over the last few weeks, leveling up multiple accounts to the 15-20 range, and I'd put it more around 80%. If I go into a 10 man pvp match at level 5, only 2-3 will be new players, with 7-8 smurfs bullying them via killing them till they're 0/25 and afk, or verbally harassing them. I want to talk about why this happens, why it's important, and how to fix it. Hopefully, this'll get enough attention to get some response from Riot, and possibly end up implementing something to fix this.\n.\n.\n.\n**Why it happens:**\nThis, is rather obvious. Riot's default response to negativity? Ban it. What happens? They just make a smurf, because it's insanely easy to do, and doesn't take that long to level a new account. But this ends up with the issue that not only are these toxic people still in the game, with a fresh account that's unpunished, and learned how to better avoid the auto-detection system, but they're in low level games.\n.\n.\n.\n**Why it's important:**\nThis, is insanely important. Outside of Asian countries, league is dying. Even though I consider it a pretty amazing game, it is. What's the main cause? Toxicity, and a lack of new players. This whole topic ties into both, but it heavily ties into the new player issue. As someone who made a new account, and even tried to be a little newbie (Like completing the entire tutorial and dying within it a lot) in case Riot had a system to try and detect smurfs, my experience was to be immediately greeted with smurfs smearing the floor with newbies, while being heavily toxic to both enemies and teammates alike. This scares off new players. I've had multiple friends from Smite and other games, I tried to get into league in the past, and they stopped trying, because of this exact experience. Without new blood, the game is only doomed to slowly die. And this transfers to higher levels too, because once those banned smurfs get back up to level, they're now toxic in ways that they know won't trigger the auto-system.\n.\n.\n.\n**How to fix it:**\nThis one is up to Riot to debate, but I have a fix that I think is pretty simple, and would work wonders. Stop banning people. That's right, you read it right. Of course, we're not counting cheaters, and people who run it down lane over and over. We're talking about people being toxic, cursing, etc... These people, while not good, if banned, just end up flooding the lower levels with toxic smurfs. Instead, offer an alternative. Instead of 10-game, 25-game, 14-day, perma, switch to a system more like, 10-game, 25-game, 14 day MUTE, one month MUTE, perma-MUTE, assuming the nature of the report is about toxicity or anything to do with typing in chat. REPEAT, FOR THOSE WHO DIDN'T READ, DO NOT REMOVE BANS. REMOVE BANS FOR SIMPLY TYPING. Muting someone, prevents the vast majority of toxicity they can bring into the game, while still allowing them to play and communicate via pings. Which means they're not making smurfs to continue playing, and they're not likely to because losing all the progress on their account just to get around a mute, isn't worth it to most people.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n**The counter arguments.** (Why is this even a thing? Who knows.)\nSince people seem to misunderstand things, let's go over this.\n\n1. **B-b-b-but Wrecked! You can't get rid of bans, that doesn't work!** - No one ever said get rid of bans. Just reserve them for people who make the game negative in ways outside of talking. Whether that's cheating, running it down lane, troll building, intentional feeding, etc... But for people who simply do nothing but talk, mute. And no, not Riot's previous history of just chat restricting over and over. A SOLID mute. As in, you cannot type, ever, during the duration of the mute. And make the mute permanent if it continues. Yes, this works, yes, it reduces toxicity. It's been proven time and time again, even in popular games such as Runescape.\n\n2. **Muting people will just make them fustrated and int!** - So will being banned. Difference is, with a mute, some players will reform, and we could perhaps even add a system to try and negotiate the mute to get it removed if you have good behavior for an extended period of time. This way we're not just making people even more fustrated for handing them a ban just for talking negatively a few times, and not only that, but stuffing them back into low level games to harass low level newbie players. And as said before, if they do start inting after a mute, then move to an actual ban.\n\n3. **You only experience smurfs in low level games cause you're smurfing!** - Bzzt, wrong. As said earlier, I intentionally acted as newbie as possible to see if it made a difference. It didn't. Not only that, but I've had multiple friends who are actually new at the game, play and say that they encountered smurfs 24/7 and quit playing because of it. I legit can't get anyone to get into League who hasn't already been playing since before 2015 because of how awful low level games are.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nAnd again, all of this is up to Riot to address and discuss how to better implement it. But we need these discussions to start happening, because despite Riot addressing toxicity in regular games, they have been doing nothing to address the massive amount of smurfs and perma-banned toxic people in low level games, snuffing out new players. \n\nTL;DR: Banning toxicity causes toxic smurfs, which snuff out new players from playing the game, and then level up to normal games and end up being toxic in ways that are undetectable by the system. Stop banning people for just talking, and start issuing long-term, or permanent mutes, or find another solution that doesn't involve just perma-banning. Save bans for negative in-game behavior such as inting, cheating, or afking.","replies":[]}
