She is good at softening front lines with her W passive being magic damage and her ult.\n\nMFs ult is like an initiation to duel \n\nplus with the Q and E buffs she can be a good lane bully again, and soften the backline more effectively with her Q. (try maxing E first, its great while you can strut to the frontline and proc a Q on the backline)\n\nIdk why she wasn't used during the tank meta. She could've just equipped Bork and Last whisperer and she would have been good\n\nshe really just needs a W buff on the magic dmg ratio and she would be fine. Its really easy to maintain her passive now\n\nHowever, giving ult buffs would make her even more flexible and hopefully competitive again but having the sustained CC from her team is enough\n\nSo this could happen:\n\n- The AA procs being added to the ult procs. (if I AA someone post ult it will be at max W passive proc.)\n\n- Intermittent increase on W ratio (would nerf her early game a tad, but be consistent for her late game) to 10% at max rank\n\n- maybe nerf her base AD but give better AD per level scaling or vice versa","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Fusha","date":"2015-08-25T21:18:01.160+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tier 2 pls.

There's something about the utility ADC role i'm drawn to, because i don't like being the damage dealer that, once he gets behind in a lane, can't help his team out no longer (these games are :( man ).\nAnd because i've also been a support main from the 4.5 Season to just recently so having a champion who fills these 2 positions is comforting and extremely rewarding. Ashe is primarily an ADC but less on the support side, which does strike an odd balance with me, just the way i like it.\n\nIf they can strike a good balance with MF's ratios (which have been outta wack for as long as she existed) and balance her damage with her AoE fighting capabilities, i think i will add MF to my **LETHAL ARSENAL OF MARSKMEN that has only 1 markswoman in it - Ashe**\n:3\n(She has always been the only one i needed)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blitz722","date":"2015-08-26T00:16:13.738+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"what are you talking about? cassiopeia is great after rework.

If it just had some more CDR or built out of Sheen or something, it could be a great first-item spike.\n\nAnother interesting idea I had for {{item:3508}} that would work as an interesting idea for MF is for it to grant AP in some form. A few various iterations:\n\n1) Grants X% of AD as AP based on scaling. So for MF, her E scales only off AP, so the ratio is a high 80%. Using E would apply 80% of her AD as AP. This could be capped at a certain percentage.\n\n2) Toggle that converts AD x 1.5 to AP. Basic attacks cancel the toggle and trigger a 10 second item CD.\n\n3) AAs stack a buff that grants X% of AD as AP. Each ability cast consumes a stack. Power could easily be modulated by adjusting the number of AAs to build a stack, number of stacks, causing stacks to degrade to minimum of 1 if not consumed, etc. \n\n4) Grant a % of stolen mana as AP for X seconds, consumed on ability use.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bitterwinter","date":"2015-08-25T18:22:06.220+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks so much; I'm looking forward to the changes!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Javabean4real","date":"2015-08-29T20:08:09.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotScruffy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wyQA5MzZ,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-08-25T15:36:04.540+0000)\n>\n> Those are still happening, just not before worlds.

So when we look at strength it's usually something like Diamond/Plat level skill. There are a lot of factors, but just clarifying some of how we judge champ strength.\nIt is actually VERY ok to have a champ be strong when exectued well. The actual \"win rate\" for balanced champs when played by a skilled and experienced player of that champ should be something like 53% not 50%. The issue is when you see that \"experienced win rate\" rise up to like 58%, then you can reasonably suspect the champ is op.\n\nhttp://champion.gg/champion/MissFortune/ADC i guess she could use some work then considering mains with 125+ games got only a low(ish) 50.76% winrate\n\nthe silly thing is that they made her incredibly oppressive in lane (one empowered Q after BF sword legit chunks you for 1/2 of your WHOLE hp, how is that healthy?) but post-lane she still hasn't got an ult","replies":[]},{"poster":"SonicÐeHedgedawg","date":"2015-08-26T19:00:37.335+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you considered that maybe it's not that Miss Fortune that's the issue but that marksman itemization is too monolithic?\n\nMiss fortune needs caster itemization given her kit, but brutalizer doesn't build into anything particularly useful on her, black cleaver has a fair bit of HP, which is a waste on her, and essence reaver is really underwhelming.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Immortal Strife","date":"2015-08-25T22:54:46.759+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The red posts are encouraging and I look forward to the not too distance future when my main marksman will actually get a update that gives her an identity and fits her thematically.  It's no secret that the recent update for MF diminished her dueling calabilities by removing her grevious wounds, which in opinion is a good move. Cutting some of her strength in 1v1s allows her chasing, escaping, and repositioning in teamfight to be buffed (passive activation on W, and shields retaining passive while up), which is a step in the right direction. However, her AOE damage output is too low. I hosetly believe in order for MF to be viable she needs to have AD AOE damage to make Last Whisper a more effective buy and increase her overall teamfight pressence. I sincerely hope Miss Fortune's next update has her Marskman role as the priority because I do not care about her AP Mage outlier role if it's going to water down her ADC effectiveness.","replies":[]}]}
