HOW IS THAT OK?\n\nBecause it's a **zero-tolerance** phrase, meaning there is no tolerance for it at all. \n\nWhat good did it do, you telling them to ''kill themselves''? Let's think it this way. You play basketball in a team, and someone plays poorly. You tell the dude to kill himself. Do you think you get away with that without any consequences? No you don't.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Inkling Commando","date":"2019-02-23T07:08:08.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"let's see here, person confused on how they got banned when they said the number one no no phrase.\" *marks it on bingo card* \"now to find a post that involved yasuo and i'll have a bingo\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"DOUBLE TAPPED E","date":"2019-02-23T06:40:41.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason is because if the person is suffering from depression (even if in this case they were not), and is already having thoughts of hurting themselves, getting confirmation from another person, even online, even as a competitive insult, might be the thing that puts them over the edge, and that's not ok.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gaxoo","date":"2019-02-23T06:46:46.118+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":13,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"despacitus","date":"2019-02-23T07:04:05.285+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":15,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Gaxoo,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=WE2pR9b2,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2019-02-23T06:46:46.118+0000)\n>\n> It's because Riot are a bunch of fascists that have a deep seated hatred of people that express themselves.\n\ntrue.","replies":[{"poster":"Timethief49","date":"2019-02-23T10:23:06.800+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you open a discussion to discuss but only reply to the one comment that is in your side?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-02-23T07:06:28.275+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"False.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gaxoo","date":"2019-02-24T04:04:58.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=cute kitty x3,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=WE2pR9b2,comment-id=00050001,timestamp=2019-02-23T07:04:05.285+0000)\n>\n> true.\n\nRiot deleted my original comment.
