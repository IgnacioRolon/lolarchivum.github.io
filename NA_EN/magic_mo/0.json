First of all, they don't play him very much, and supposedly his kit is perfect for them, so that should tell you something.  Second of all, pros prefer complex and difficult champions, so what little they do play Bard probably has more to do with his high skill cap than whether or not he's genuinely good.  And finally what does it matter?  Even if he's decent in the hands of a pro he's garbage in the hands of nearly all normal LoL players.  Bard was a mistake by Riot.  Period.

I've gone 0/10/0 before and won (in ranked) because my ass got carried. I've gone 20/3/7 and lost (in rankeD) because I was playing like shit. Win or loss for the singular player is everything.\n\nI said this as a complete and utter fact, something your dumbass can't comprehend. \n\nAnd uh, hold on. WHO is the one not making any arguments? Your literally just insulting me by saying my arguments are empty... without even quoting me directly? Like whatta fuck? Have you read ANY of my other posts? I respond to arguments with arguments.

We think you just hate Bard in general.\n\nWhere in the fuck did you actually post this counterargument in this thread? Nowhere. Please stop pulling shit out of your ass, but sure I'll respond to it anyway:\n\nAs I've said already about a trillion times to other idiotic Bard players, your loss is your fault over the course of many games. Of course, you get troll games and AFK games but those will average out in the long run. If you've played Bard 30+ times and have a negative win/loss ratio, guess what? You suck dick with Bard. Furthermore, if ALL the Bards in ranked have a negative win/loss with him over 30+ games, guess what? Bard is a shit champion. Get over it.\n\nSame *cannot* be said for Leona. For one, there's SEVERAL players I've seen with a positive winrate in ranked with her. For a second, there are the simply hundreds of pros across the WORLD with positive winrates with her in *COMPETITIVE PLAY.* Comparing the two is just retarded, something you don't seem to fucking understand. \n\n>I've ulted fleeing enemies to give my team time to catch up. If I'm not confident I can catch the enemy and not ruin my teammate's day, I don't ult and instead pop Talisman, land meep autos to slow or use any of the other tools in my support repertoire.\n\nThanks, where's the argument here? I'm not saying it's impossible to make plays with Bard, I'm just saying it's too fucking hard and there are champions that are so much better at doing whatever the hell he does... like Leona or even Janna and Alistar. \n\nThis argument is like saying \"look guys, I can CC the enemy!\" Great, welcome to every other fucking champion in the game.\n\nAnd before ending this post, some of your intellectual and articulate \"arguments\" were: \n>And go ahead, keep dodging when I pick Bard. It doesn't stop me. \n>I got news for you: You'll get me once, then once you dodge you have a timer and I can queue up again immediately and STILL PICK BARD. Again, dodging doesn't 'fix' the problem you seem to think there is.\n\n>You - Bard sucks, here's why.\n\n>Everyone else - Bard doesn't suck, here's why.\n\n>You - LA LA LA I CANT HEAR YOU.\n\n>Good day.\n\nYour \"arguments\" are... where? Especially in that first one, why in the fuck would I give a shit about you playing Bard? I've already decided you're an idiot for doing so (after repetitively losing with Bard). There's no argument there, just useless information like \"the sky's blue.\" \n\nGood usage of direct quoting in that last quote btw.
