Nope. 0. Period. &quot;I want to solo dragon early&quot; -- WW can do this with no buffs and just AD runes and AS quints at level ONE. &quot;buh raptor clear&quot; you don&#039;t take damage in the jungle as warwick. At all.\r\n\r\nAt level 1, I start gromp, then blue, then wolves, then raptors, THEN red, then golems, then walk all the way back to gromp, do the entire jungle again and by then whatever hp i lost between levels 2-4 is already gained back by the level 5. And I don&#039;t use potions. I buy a machete + green. He doesn&#039;t run oom that early on in the game. If he does, stop spamming Q every time it&#039;s off CD and use it only to regain your lost health.\r\n\r\nSo please. Stop building rangers. It&#039;s shit on him.

Warwick is a late game champion. His very DEFINITION and EXISTANCE is 0% existance pre-6 EXCEPT in his own jungle which he completely dominates (very hard to counter WW because camps are rarely up). While it's possible to gank pre-6 with an E it rarely happens is more opportunistic than planned. \n\nSince he's a mid-game cc bot and a late-game God, rangers is uselss because by the time you get done with your Bork/Wit's end + devourer the .1 second you save to kill raptors doesn't help as much as a good skirmisher's would against the enemy ADC/mid laner (top maybe). The pick potential with skirmisher's is absolutely absurd as well. You combine it with red buff and you get a more powerful \"ignite\" than the actual spell.\n\nSwitching it out isn't viable either since you will get to level 6 about the same time regardless--by the time you're STARTING the buff you started the game off, so around 7:30.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2015-04-02T23:51:10.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a great pick for many champs including him.
