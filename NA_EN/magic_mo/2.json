They pull cheese like no other. When's the last time an European team not named UOL did well in an international event since LAST SEASON WORLDS?\n\nCan&#039;t say NA has only 1 good international team tbh. If we&#039;re talking \"pure\" NA teams I&#039;d say C9 is still retardedly good as well as TL (if they ever get out of 4th) and CLG (didn&#039;t make the cut though). And outside of those, TSM still looks to be dominating on an international stage as long as they don&#039;t get cheesed the living fuck out of. \n\nIn conclusion,\nNA > EU","replies":[{"poster":"BearSage","date":"2015-04-06T04:27:54.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, I think you're correct about  TSM being an international threat considering Katowice. I do like TL and C9 but I do think that UOL has enough diversity (aka cheese) to surprise the other teams. Seems like SK can get shut down (again katowice) and Fnatic might have the issue of too many competing personalities. We'll have to see. Hopefully there's more cheddar to go around.","replies":[{"poster":"Magic Mo","date":"2015-04-06T05:13:22.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that's what I mean. UOL is EU's only hope lmao. If we count TSM as NA then holy shit is NA strong. If we don't, I'd say other teams (c9) can still be top tier.","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-04-06T16:10:42.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why wouldn't you count a team that competes and represents TSM as NA?\n\nWhat would we count TSM as? If we don't count TSM because of their two EU and one KR player as NA (where they play), then we can't could H2K or Fnatic as EU.\n\nThis TSM isn't an NA team is getting ridiculous.","replies":[{"poster":"Magic Mo","date":"2015-04-06T19:47:01.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*sigh*\nThat's just to pacify all the kids that like arguing about whether or not TSM is NA. *cough*\n\nI for one don't give a shit and do count them as NA.","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-04-06T20:19:55.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't pacify children.
