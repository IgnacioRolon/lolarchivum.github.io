We've all encountered that frustration of just wanting to play a game and not being able to. I'm just happy to help ^_^!\n\nThat chromium error you're seeing could be caused by something interfering with the repair tool. Try closing out all other programs, then run the tool from the default install location (should be C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Hextech Repair Tool). That should get the repair tool running!","replies":[{"poster":"ClimaxPotato","date":"2017-03-21T00:36:01.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing changed.
