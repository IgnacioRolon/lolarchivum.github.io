This doesn't just happen in League of Legends. It happens everywhere. People troll over the internet cus it has no real consequences for them, cus they're anonymous, and nobody's monitoring them. \nNow, if these snowflakes were punished by someone in real life over the stupid shit they do and say to people online, on the same level as they would be in real life, they would be too scared to do anything. It's what elementary school kids do until they get a beating. \nI also think it's a problem that riot just lets them keep playing. Should maybe learn from World of Warcraft and have people pay monthly to play. F2P games are more often than not troll infested. People dont invest money in trolling. \nAlso, riot games need to change their ban policy. Dont ban players for telling trolls to stop trolling. You have a chat function in an online multiplayer game!

We won early, lost horribly mid game ( mid lissandra fed katarina, the ASSASIN COUNTER) ( liss was the one being most abusive too lol. Even our adc was like \" liss lucian hasn't fed akali a single kill and you've fed Kat. give the guy some credit\") everyone wanted to surrender but I told everyone assassins fall off late game. Everyone was saying I was full of shit but sure enough after turtleing for like 20 minutes, we aced them in our base and won...
