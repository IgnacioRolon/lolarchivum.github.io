Just like timed chess!","subforum":"Maps & Modes","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have posted an idea about timed matches a couple of times. It never takes off from the looks of popularity. BUT I don&#039;t understand the rejection of an idea that in no way effects the current game. IT would be an additional mode. I would love someone to tell me what the harm is in knowing that the game will end in 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nWe will assign values to objectives and kills. If the game isn&#039;t over in x minutes the winner is decided by points. It could help reinforce objective play, it would give those with a short amount of time a place to play, and it would be a way to try different methods of play out without being drug into a 60 minute game.\r\n\r\nTHERE IS NO DOWN SIDE.

Why must I always agree to the 2 year contract.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2015-06-27T15:40:13.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The downside is the fact that there is gonna be a super snowball, and no one is going to be focused on objectives. its a game mode that would have you do things that you wouldn't in any other mode.","replies":[{"poster":"Occams Raiser","date":"2015-06-27T19:37:59.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The objectives would be worth more than kills.
