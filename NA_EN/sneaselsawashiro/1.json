Then the enemy team will join in.\n\nIt&#039;s funny how so many people say &quot;you have to fail a few times to get good and even pros make mistakes&quot;, it doesn&#039;t help in that I know that I for myself am a VERY bad AND STUPID player.\nSo if you&#039;ve ever seen me and say to me &quot;no offense, but you&#039;re bad&quot;, I already long knew that I'm very bad.\n\nBut yes, I have whined a lot indeed, and have been chat banned both on this account and on my new account NewYetOldName. I know very well that I&#039;m far from those angelic players out there.\nI&#039;ve been a bit smart on how I word my self-contempt and expectations of what my foes think of me, but failure in this kind of game is just one of the most frustrating things ever since it just has to impact everyone else around you, and create such horrible first impressions that takes YEARS to work on.\n\nIn my case, I&#039;ve yet to learn shit like playing from behind whenever I feed my lane opponent via bad mechanics, trying to learn how to shake off fed {{champion:86}}/{{champion:75}}/{{champion:83}} and shit like that from my towers for free, playing ranged champions like a god, trying to master unlocked screen, learning certain matchups, all in the shortest time possible.\n\nAnd from there, it just seems stupid that I need as much skills as around a gold-to-diamond player in order to do better than bronze, only to rise up to ONE rank.\nEven if I ignore everyone via muting all chat, the fact remains that it&#039;s easy for a fool like me to understand that the games have gone south all because I messed up mechanically with no knowledge to fix it. Otherwise, I wouldn&#039;t have to get ripped on. This overall just lowers my morale and causes me to get angry at people who tell me \"just play the game\" because I would argue with the fact that trying to make me do my job as mechanically perfect as possible is so far-fetched when I, a bronzie, screwed it up in the first place.\n\nAlmost like people forget that most pros also started out as bad as a dumbass like me. But hey, no one seems to care about that fact at all, cause they may be just as ignorant as I would be towards that to be unable to see it.\nAnd that seems to be the massive case with this game in general, and possibly from what I hear about reddit roasting almost ANYTHING bad about a League figurehead AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE (blame MagikarpUsedFly&#039;s vid about things he hates about League for that).","replies":[{"poster":"Yes Daddy PIease","date":"2018-01-21T07:02:50.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"alright as one of the few people who probably read the entire post work for word id like to say\nas a toplane and jungle player (illaoi fiora warwick hecarim)\n\nyes maybe you screwed up, and yes maybe you made the game go to crap\nplaying in normals is a normal experience, spam games there, it dosent matter if you win or lose\nhowever in ranked people do get serious, you should honestly not be playing ranked if you know that you have insufficient game knowledge or mechanics, because people do get mad if you mess up. think of it like playing a team sport, basketball for example, would you be fine if youre in the playoffs and there is someone on your team who dosent know how to do a lay up or pass or dribble? no. would you get mad at em, yes\n\nhowever remember this is a game, and that you play games to have fun. if at any point it is not fun for you, that is a good indication that it is a good time to stop, calm down, take a cold shower and see if you still want to play. \n\nanyways relax and have fun","replies":[{"poster":"SneaselSawashiro","date":"2018-01-21T07:54:23.514+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then comes in \"go back to bots\"\n\nNot sure if beating the shit out of CPU's who are programmed to be beaten at some point no matter what is a good thing or a bad thing, especially if it either ruins your pride or teaches you bad habits.\n\nIt's just that there are times where I wish I was instantly a god at the game so I don't have to trigger the shit out of my teammates, and/or could also wish I could enhance my progress on my skills in a shorter time.\n\nIt's all fun and games when you notice an average joe can improve at the game much better than someone like me can. :P Now that's just my level of stupidity at its finest when you just need to expect every player to fight at their best but then suddenly end up 0/10 in lane like over 85% of the playerbase.","replies":[{"poster":"Yes Daddy PIease","date":"2018-01-21T08:14:29.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i... didnt say go back to bots?\ni suggested normals to practice?","replies":[{"poster":"SneaselSawashiro","date":"2018-01-21T08:58:12.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Derp, I meant to say that I'm also going to normals because my new account isn't level 30 yet. You know shit gets stupid for me if I can't beat people in normals pvp.\n\nAnd I also edited my prior comment.\n\nAlso I had a normals game where I did okay as Renekton, but even though we won, the jungle Wukong on my team was much better than I was.\nA lot of people also chewed me out for not being there in a teamfight, and my fuking mechanics with Renekton are shit. The only reason we won was because people focused fire on me and then my team could just go around and blast them apart.\n\nI'm still trying to learn Renekton, and Wukong is my best champion....but my positioning is so piss poor.\n\nTime to spend over 5 years mastering that damn shit.... *sigh*","replies":[{"poster":"Yes Daddy PIease","date":"2018-01-21T09:33:01.670+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ahhhhhhh im invested in this now because i know that feel as a toplaner too\neither i jump in and get flamed as illaoi \nor i split and get flamed for not tp ing into to suicide as fiora\n\nanyways if you were just there tanking as renekton then you did your job as a tank, if you were building full damage and didnt manage to blow up the back line thats a nother story\nwukong plays rather similarily dosent he, he dives the back line and tries to blow up as many as possible right\n\nwell anyways think of yourself as a suicide bomber in those cases, however you dont want to die for free, or if ur fed try to make sure you make at least 2 of them go down with you\n\nheres another thing i try to do when playing fiora particularly, i try to imagine what would happen if i did x or if i did y and act on that\nhow much damage would i take if i go for the backline, how much if i try to blow up the kled, the lux, sejuani, who on their team can i kill that would make us win, who on their team can my team not get to but i can, who can i lock down\n\nsometimes going around in the jungle is a good choice, make sure they dont know or ull just get turned on and die\n\nits a misconception that you have to be a god at mechanics and playing the game, all you have to do sometimes is not make it too hard for others to carry you, meaning dont feed (more so than you have) dont make stupid plays (contesting baron 1v5 when they have everything up), dont flame or tilt if others flame you, learn to ward, have map awareness, know when to push, know when to defend, cs decently \npeel for ur carries\n\nalso remember that normals has its own mmr where if you win a lot you will get placed against better and better players, as a silver 4 last season i was regularily seeinng gold+ players and getting stomped, i would go on losing streak and all of a sudden i would be playing against high bronze and low silver, win some lose some, and repeat","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2018-01-21T11:10:58.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welp, there's the problem pal, it's in the title, you're trying you're very hardest, but seriously don't, it's really taxing and frustrating on your mind and body if you do it for a long period of time, you should use you badness to your advantage, purposely play afk under turret hit the S button on keyboard for stop and bait the cocky, foolish person that thinks he beats you under turret and rekt him under it, say hold on I'm lagging, as you purposely miss all your skill shots except cc, baiting again with your jungler right there to gank you if they engaged close enough.

I read this post off somewhere about macro and micro, where as a gold player who has decent macro (only knows that destroying nexus wins the game)/lightning fast micro can go 12/0 and win the game due to the sheer difference in micro play in low tier but at higher tiers he'll always lose because the ideal situation is to master both,","replies":[{"poster":"SneaselSawashiro","date":"2018-01-21T21:06:08.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then imagine if I did that...only to achieve silver when in theory, I could've been past gold like any average joe. :P\n\nIf I tried to learn how to fake bad play, I assume it would be another 3 years on my part to master that damn shit.","replies":[]}]}]}
