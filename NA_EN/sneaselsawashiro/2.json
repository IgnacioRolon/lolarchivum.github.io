Like for example there&#039;s often tips about &#039;how do I get out of X elo&#039; and so forth while Dong Huap uses analogies and recently, Exil has made great videos explaining why dummies like me are stuck in low elo and why there&#039;s so many low elo players in the first place etc.\n\nP.S. Trying into Exil's points, I should've realized that even though I've started since Season 3, I don't have enough time to devote fully to this game every single moment. Oh well, I suppose.","replies":[]}
