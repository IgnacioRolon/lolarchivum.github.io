And don't ever int like that. There is a special place in hell for int'ers. Like I don't even want to help you now.\n\nDon't watch SRO, he trolls a lot (and smurfs) for ratings and views and streams just to make money. If you watch streams watch an LCS player (as much as I hate saying that), until you get good enough to tell what streamers are skilled and which ones just get noob views for content. \n\nDon't watch youtube vids either, they are usually just clickbait that won't teach you anything (or teach you wrong).\n\nAdmitting your mistakes is honestly the biggest step you can take towards improving. After every play ask yourself how you could have done it better, even if you did well. And be specific like I could have stepped into the bush to temporarily disengage and reset, or I could have dropped a ward when they stepped in so it didn't break my aa or combo chain, I could have sidestepped that skillshot, etc.\n\nThe next biggest thing I can suggest is just learn the basics, practice last hitting (play norms/bots just to do that, don't worry about fighting), learn the flow of the game (take a tower and fall back, expect rotations after first blood tower, learn when to expect ganks etc), learn all the champs (don't just look them up, play them for a few games, learn their skills, their cooldowns, their ranges, so you can predict their plays and know when and how to outplay them), learn the matchups like who counters who etc.","replies":[{"poster":"SneaselSawashiro","date":"2018-01-11T23:16:51.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welp. I've learned to never pay for boosting again, and hence why on my new account I'm never touching ranked for a while. I'm not even Level 30 yet by the time of typing this so I was basically limited to normals so thus I could somewhat get away with inting.\nEven if I tried, anything I could've done would've amounted to failure due to my inability to know TF like a god right off the bat (and if only I knew he was out of the meta I wouldn't have picked a losing battle). Plus, I personally hate laning against a Lux, especially if some fucwad like me can't dodge her E + Arcane Comet for shit lol (prepare to judge for bronze memes).\n\nSRO is good for one thing; he explains almost EVERY move he does along with a good amount of facts about his current situation in the game. His vids despite the recent trolling he does, are still educational. He explains most of his shit thoroughly such as during the laning phase. He even said during a podcast that he wants to end up with a coaching profession one day.\n\nWhen it comes to me playing Yasuo however, the one thing I'm good at with him is farming as patiently as possible. Trying to trade effectively with him is the hard part.\n\nLast time I was doing so well as Wukong vs. Teemo top; sadly, enemy Vayne got fed and my positioning according to Mobalytics was pure crap. Also, I never knew until later that Vayne was Plat 3. So yeah...ggez. Report Wukong for picking a losing battle (we also had no ADC).","replies":[{"poster":"Oxyrotten","date":"2018-01-11T23:43:24.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stop that. Stop thinking like that. Int'ing is wrong, it is never ok. There is no \"getting away with it\". It is wrong and should **NEVER** be done. Period. People who int are one of the *worst* problems with this game.\n\nYou got boosted pre30? o.O? Boosting is paying someone to play with/for you to increase your rank. Paying pre30 is like a scam on a scam. Yeah don't do it, it's pointless (other than maybe bragging to your friends at school who really don't care anyway), and it's cheating. Plus it ruins other people's ranked games because your playing above your skill level and can't compete so then they are left with dead weight on their team, also it raises the mean mmr which means your team is all playing people above their skill level which is unfair.\n\nSRO does do a good job of explaining things, I will give him that, but he smurfs so his mechanics and skill get a bit overrated. And his troll builds are just him abusing his skill on low elo and bad examples of how to play.\n\nPart of the problem I can see is your picking champs with high skill floors. Yasuo and TF have very high skill floors and are mechanically complex, requiring a good amount of not only game knowledge but also practiced skill with that specific champ. Wu kong also although he is a bit lower skill floor but still a decently high skill cap, also he isn't that strong at the moment so it makes him harder to play efficiently. \n\nI've never used mobalytics but positioning is one of the most important skills in the game to learn, and one of the most basic perhaps (perhaps not basic though). League is just a giant really super complex game of chess, each piece on the board has it's own moves and purpose, position them right and you can make the enemy do what you want and vice versa. But yeah you get those games, it happens learn what you can and click play again. Also watch the replays and see what you (or others) could have done better.","replies":[{"poster":"SneaselSawashiro","date":"2018-01-12T00:10:15.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean to say on my old account \"SneaselSawashiro\" is when I boosted.

There are habits I have to break when I get into higher elos. Things that used to fly in bronze don't fly in silver. Things that used to fly in silver don't fly in gold.

It's disheartening to not know why I lost the fight or game but sometimes it happens.\n\nSometimes the reason is that you had control over the situation and there was something else you could have done... and sometimes you didn't have control over the situation and no matter how well you played, you would have lost the fight or game.\n\nSometimes having someone else watch your replay helps you understand if there was something you could have done to change the outcome vs nothing you could have done to have changed the outcome.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-01-10T16:43:21.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say focus on the things that are measurable.\n\nIf you are laning, CS@10 and CS@15 are good numbers to keep track of and measure game over game. If you are jg, your CS, counter jungling count and number of ganks matter. For supports, how many successful trades / Enemy CS denial / successful times your wards spotted someone are important.\n\nMid game, count the number of times you have successfully out rotated the enemy to an objective.\n\nLate game check out your positioning and team fighting awareness.

So the question is whether you want to be better at the game or just climb fast. \n\nIn bronze if you want to climb fast, just AFK farm for the best CS score for 20 minutes and then once you get 2 items above every else, you face roll them 1v3. \n\nIn silver, have 1 wave slow push the two side waves and ARAM down mid.\n\nBut things you do to win games in gold / plat / diamond is different than what you do in bronze, cos people in bronze / silver don't know enough about how the game works.

I've honestly never dealt with feeling incompetent, so, I'm not really sure how much what I'll say will help, but, I might as well throw what I can out there.\n\nFirst (and probably most importantly) - when you start getting tilted, breathe. Four seconds in, seven seconds out. Whenever I get aggravated, I always try to do this, and most of the time, it keeps me levelled out for long enough to keep focused on the task at hand. It may not help for you, but, it's worth a try.\n\nSecond, perhaps remind yourself that a bad play is just that - one bad play. It may hurt you in the long run, but it also might not, and considering it only a small misstep might help you keep an unclouded perspective on what your next move should be.\n\nThird - in the overall sense, try not to think of yourself as being incompetent in either way. I've never seen unswlolsoc, but, if they're proposing that most people are either unwittingly incompetent or consciously incompetent, then they're just spreading a pessimistic viewpoint. It may be difficult, but try viewing yourself as great, rather than incompetent. Even if you aren't, there's a saying that applies well here: \"Fake it 'til you make it.\"\n\nAnd, fourth, if trying to find a solution to a problem is proving difficult, you might want to try stopping yourself for looking for it. Try running on instinct rather than logic, think less and run with an action. Of course, I only suggest this within reason - one should always have a mental barrier up to prevent themselves from towerdiving, even if the enemy under the tower is so tantalizingly close to death that a stiff breeze could put them in a grey screen.\n\nI'm not sure how well any of this will help, but I hope some of it does in some respect.\n\nAlso - if this was just a vent post and not one asking for advice, I apologize.","replies":[{"poster":"SneaselSawashiro","date":"2018-01-10T22:49:58.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is that this topic can be difficult to deal with because we all commonly see people who love to deny their mistakes and imperfections. :P","replies":[]}]}]}
