I usually play League on the weekends and I will be doing other things between games. I often forget what I need to do if the game runs long. So I would love a little reminder I could set saying like: 'Move the laundry over'. Or other things like that. I always tell my friends right before the game like hey remind me to do (x, y, z) after the game. But we usually forget. I think a little reminder during the post game would be super cool. What do y'all think?","replies":[]}
