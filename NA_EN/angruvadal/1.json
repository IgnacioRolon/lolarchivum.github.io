It feels like they want toxic players running rampant through their game. They say mute players and report them after the game. I do this at least once a day when I play. I do this but it doesn't fix the problem. The problem is Riot encourages this kind of behavior, they want assholes ruining their game. If they didn't they would do something, anything really. I have really grown to despise and hate Riot Games. Anytime I try to contact them I get some intern who tells me \"just mute them\". Okay, how do I mute trolls who ruin the game? The only thing you can mute is toxic players and hateful chats. I wish for once someone with authority at Riot would answer my questions, but I always get the same responses from the lower employees. I just played a game where 4 of their team were being super racist, sexist, hateful, etc. So I reported them after the game. And nothing will happen. Riot is becoming more and more corrupt and evil. They really do not care what anyone has to say. Every time I try to suggest something they ignore me and continue to encourage bad behavior. It is a fun game, but some of the worst human beings play it and Riot likes it. I miss the old tribunal, nothing was more satisfying than getting that message that someone I reported has been punished. Riot really does not give to shits anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-12-13T03:43:29.953+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":">  The problem is Riot encourages this kind of behavior, they want assholes ruining their game.\n\nIllogical. They do not benefit riot in any way.\n\nThere is no way for riot to eliminate them. No game in the history of the internet has eliminated toxic behavior or trolling.

I would avoid hyperbolic exaggeration when trying to make a serious point about something that you care about. It just makes people not take you seriously and downvote you and ignore any actual points buried within. When you say \"riot encourages this kind of behavior\" even though everyday theres multiple threads where players are being banned for this kind of behavior, people honestly just think you must be stupid. Just being honest lol.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2018-12-13T05:36:13.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sounds like you're reporting players just because they're playing poorly.\n\nThat's not how it works.
