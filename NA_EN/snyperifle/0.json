I know the check comes on from the audio in my team's voice chat. As soon as the check comes up, my client will disconnect, with the reconnecting message popping up. During this reconnecting period, I can send and receive messages in the chat. I do not disconnect during games, or just browsing the client. My internet is not disconnecting. \n\nI'm getting tired of 5/15 minute dodge buster penalties, advice?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-17T02:25:37.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're being disconnected during the afk check, it's a pretty clear sign of an unstable connection between your network and our game servers.
