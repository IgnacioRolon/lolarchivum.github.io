Everyone hates a noob right? So I have been playing bots to get my runes and help me level up but not once have I received mastery points. \r\n\r\nMust I be a certain level to get mastery points or is it simply not available whilst playing against A I \r\n\r\nI have read about 3 threads from riot but none of them list the basic requirements for earning champion mastery points, should include level requirement, what style of game (PVP or Bots or twisted tree, etc. ) and maybe an incentive of the kind of rewards that will be available other than a badge :p\r\n\r\nIf someone can clear this up, that would be swell :)\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nBlood Red Dragon","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-25T03:39:00.469+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Welcome to League of Legends!
