Your whole attitude right now is basically \"I'm a loyal customer, until I'm held accountable for my behavior, then I'm not one\".\n\nYes trolls are annoying, and I'm sorry you got them. However, the solution is not to become what you despise just because of a temporary ban for your own poor behavior. If you're truly a loyal customer as you claim, then prove it by growing up and showing that you deserve to keep playing the game, as you still have a chance to play on your main account. Otherwise if this is how you're gonna react and handle things not going your way then you might as well just find another game to play as this kind of attitude is not gonna be tolerated here at all whatsoever.\n\nP.S. Trolls and inters do get banned but because they're getting smarter about how they avoid detection (and because Riot wants to try to avoid punishing innocent players as much as possible) it's harder to catch them in the act compared to simple chat-related offenses. Gameplay related offenses when proven to be on purpose are assigned a 2-week ban as the first punishment.

Riot absolutely does not tolerate trolls, but the problem stems from not only having to prove that they're intentionally trolling (not always clear-cut) but also false reports of trolling that are just simply unintentional poor performances. When trolls are caught though it's an instant 14-day ban as the first offense.\n \n> Edit: Also I WAS a loyal customer. I even spent money on skins. Fk this game\n\nYour point? Spending money =/= immunity to the rules. I get that you're mad but rather than throw a temper tantrum and act like a little kid try taking a step back and work on improving your behavior instead. We all get trolls from time to time but feeding them or becoming them is not the solution. Be the better person rather than stoop down to their level (easier said than done I know but still though).\n\nP.S. Only your chat is shown in your Reform Card because it's only your behavior being judged in your case and no one elses. It's the same for everyone else who receives one, and it's to get people to focus on where they went wrong rather than look for someone else to blame for their mistakes.","replies":[{"poster":"TekihcaN","date":"2018-08-25T05:12:55.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":9,"body":"How is reacting to injustice in your games bad behavior? \nShould I just sit there and waste 30 minutes of my life dying or be running around the map because my support and midlaner decide to hijack my farm ? \nDo I just sit there doing nothing and wasting my time when trolls hijack my game and refuse to surrender an already doomed game? \nWhy should I shut up when I get mid and some jungler who was supposed to take smite, intentionally takes ignite and then hijacks my mid lane?\nOr do I say nothing to people who gang up on me because all I did was point out why the support isn't warding , I have to ward and they just waste their gold on items that aren't even useful for their champs aka a rabadons on soraka ? \nI should also have stayed quiet for the blitz that refused to support me after the first wave and began roaming all across the map and invading the enemy jungler while I get tower dove over and over and over and over. \nOr I should just farm gromp when I get a MF support who walks up the entire game and feeds into the enemy adc and supp.\n\nI have to end up playing -cant even leave because then I get reported for AFK. \nSo you just suggest we shut up and take it, waste our 30min and forget that it ever happened? \n\nSorry.

Trolls troll to get a negative reaction out of you, so if you don't give them that then chances are they'll stop trolling and play properly (not always but sometimes). Also, you can do what some other people do in this situation, which is make the most of a bad situation and focus on improving your skills such as csing for future games. It has nothing to do with \"insert insult here\", it's about not stooping down to their level and not letting them drag you down with them.\n\n> I live alone, I don&#x27;t have friends coz Im not living in my own country because its a shithole and this game is all I did after work.\n> \n> Im crying because we give our time and money to this game. \n> I know it doesn&#x27;t mean shit to Riot and nobody cares about that either.

I can be possibly better off trolling. \n\nYes it's easier to catch chat-related offenses but that doesn't mean that gameplay trolls don't get punished, it just takes longer to catch. When it is caught though it's a 2-week ban first offense.\n\nAlso, if you truly valued your time and money then you should have thought of that before you decided to act up consistently enough to receive a 2-week ban. Right now your problem is you're just looking for excuses to try to justify your behavior when you should be focused on improving your behavior for the better. It's just a 2-week ban, so while you are on thin ice you still have the opportunity to prove that you can improve your behavior, but you can't do that though if you're constantly looking for excuses to try to justify your behavior.\n\n> But...\n> Just forget it. Im finding a new game to play. I don&#x27;t have it in me to be a person who trolls.\n\nIf that's the case then so be it, but if you do decide to play again then just focus on trying to improve your behavior and try to handle future situations like that better so you don't wind up in this situation again. It's not rocket science, and though difficult it's definitely possible.","replies":[{"poster":"Epiclollipopz","date":"2018-08-25T18:33:34.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Now normally I'd let a post like this go.

Never once did this person apologize or even acknowledge that they have a problem with their own ridiculous systems which he/she admits quite smugly in fact that it's harder to catch players who have non chat related offenses and therefore they've decided to do absolutely nothing to rectify the situation.

Who knows.\nCreating troll accs isn't really \"quitting\". Instead of creating troll accounts and ruining your chances of playing even more, just quit perm until you feel like coming back. If you need assistance or reasons why you got banned...just email Riot. They're extremely descriptive and helpful.\nBest of wishes.\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Night M0nkey","date":"2018-08-26T00:28:42.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you've been banned because you got upset at trolls and afkers. \nAnd as retaliation you're going to troll and afk? \nSure.
