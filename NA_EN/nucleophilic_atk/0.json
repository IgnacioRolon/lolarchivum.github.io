IIRC, the explanation is that SPF is like Primetime Draven: a perpetually discounted skin. I would say that SPF is generally better than Risen Fiddlesticks, but they're so different in theme and direction that it's not really possible to say that one is strictly superior to the other.\n\nI will say that it would be super great if Risen Fiddlesticks could have same alteration to its walking animation as Dark Candy Fiddlesticks has during its ult. That was easily the best part of DKF, and really made Fiddles's ult feel like an even bigger moment of strength.","replies":[{"poster":"EnderForHegemon","date":"2015-04-23T16:52:14.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This guy is right.
