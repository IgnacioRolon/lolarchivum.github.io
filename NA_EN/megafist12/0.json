When I enter the loading screen about 1 minute later it says my internet is disconnected and points me to the reconnect button. I checked the net and everything is working as it should, so I just quit the client and reconnect in order to get in that game. But oh Lord it doesn't stop there!!1 When I get into the game everything appears to be normal? But then it just attempts to reconnect for at least 30 seconds every time, every 2 or 3 minutes. Pls I wish to play this game like I should!!!\r\nPresentation of my games: {{summoner:6}} {{summoner:6}} {{summoner:3}} {{summoner:6}} {{summoner:6}} {{summoner:3}} {{summoner:6}} {{summoner:6}} .","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-07T20:53:21.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From your description, it sounds like you're experiencing severe packet loss to the server.
