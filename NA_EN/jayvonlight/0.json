I don't\nEdit: So what I said was a zero tolerance word? it was used in a joke manner so I assume it still was a wrongful ban. I've seen and reported a lot of players using words worse than this and they don't get banned, so im assuming the bot only picks up on stuff if multiple players report you\nEdit:2 Oh I now see that jokes are not allowed in league of legends?

I think he's saying he got banned for 14 days. He's way too calm for it to be a perm ban seeing as his account is level 238...","replies":[{"poster":"JayVonLight","date":"2019-11-17T04:48:41.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thats a zero tolerance word? really?

If you are reported, we will take action.\n**You:** Ok, but I was joking when I said something racist, so it is different for me.\n\nWhy should there be separate rules for you? If you are _correctly_ reported by anyone in that match for saying a slur, then it's going to get reviewed and if the system picks up on that word you're in for a ban of some sort. If you report them for something else, then it's probably not going to get noticed. A lot of people don't file the right report.\n\nYou said a slur, someone reported you for hate speech, and the chatlogs were reviewed to look for what you said. Context doesn't matter because this is the internet.\n\nIt's like, why even risk it? Clearly they didn't think it was funny, and Riot doesn't have time to judge the humor in everything we say through text.

Stuff like what you got banned for is not considered a joke by the vast majority of people, nor is \"just joking around\" considered a catch-all excuse. In the future if you want to joke around like this (which I don't recommend doing period) then do it with a full premade who understands they're jokes and won't report you for it. Otherwise just find other jokes to tell.","replies":[{"poster":"JayVonLight","date":"2019-11-17T23:27:31.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ok thanks dude","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
