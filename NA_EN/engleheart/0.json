The funny thing is I can still post on this forum but I cant change my e-mail that my account is tied to (my old e-mail is no longer in existence) or just change my password for account management. I have submitted a ticket but from what I understand there is little hope there. I have bank statements show when I bought RP and e-mail confirmation that my old e-mail no longer works. How much hope is there to recover my account? How often are the support e-mails followed up by an actual human?  Ive spent damn near 2k on my account buying skins, any advice from anyone on getting that money back if they dont fix this problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Engleheart","date":"2017-08-31T04:09:01.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Got my account back, Thanks fam.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-28T22:33:09.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm it sounds and looks like someone might have found a way to get access to your account without you realizing, and was then able to get the password changed.

I've tried to get back in touch with my college about setting up my old college e-mail account that the LoL account was originally under again, but because it is the beginning of a new semester, so they said it would have to wait till the end of the week, and if they can get permission to even do something like that.\n\nI'm still waiting on a response to my ticket, but thank you for the update! Pretty jarring logging on to my account and not being able to log in {{champion:32}}","replies":[]}]}]}
