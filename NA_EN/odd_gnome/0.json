When it happens it completely disconnects me from Discord, and League for like 15 seconds then it lets me play again. This doesn't happen with any other game. Any advice? {{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-03T02:44:30.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The few times I've seen this happen, it's been caused by either a really old modem or a modem that has some issues with the bandwidth requires to run a few different apps and League.\n\nI recommend resetting your modem by unplugging the power of your modem and leaving it unplugged for 60 seconds before plugging it back in. Restart your PC, then play a match to see if this still happens.\n\nLet me know what you experience.","replies":[]}]}
