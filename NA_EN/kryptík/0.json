Now £10 gets you 1750RP, so like 7/8 chests. with annoying RP left over. Why did it change? It was so nice having it smooth, without getting simply small ammounts of RP left over if that makes sense. Feels like a way to squeeze to spend £15 for 10 chests instead of £10. Why was there now warning in the patch notes?","replies":[{"poster":"RavenHusky","date":"2017-07-26T22:18:28.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements-en/4ofsXeTV-rp-price-adjustment-for-players-in-the-uk","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-26T21:13:14.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not familiar with any currency adjustments in your region, or the method of payment (some methods don't offer bonus RP).
