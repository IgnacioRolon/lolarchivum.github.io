As the game goes on, your health bar is more and more of a formality than something that actually has any kind of meaning. Lux has a health bar like jaywalking is a crime. It only matters when they catch you. As far as mids and mage supports go, only Anivia is worse, and you barely pass Zyra and Zilean as you level up.\n\nOther characters typically build health items to live longer, and armor/magic resist to increase their effective health. At certain points, 1 point of armor is more useful than 1 point of health against a physical attack, blah blah blah, you can set up a formula, blah blah blah...\n\nNo. Not for you. Your offense is AP and CDR. Your defense is keeping your distance.\n\nLeague has a lot of technical terms that get thrown around a lot. Bad laners and bad junglers will argue about \"map pressure.\" The Tryndamere or Nasus whose face is on a milk carton and has the lowest Damage to Turrets insists they are \"split pushing.\" If you listen to Iron Yasuos and Rivens, they'll regale you about their \"mechanics.\" Lots of (bad) players will brag about their \"mechanics.\" They'll debate whether someone is playing a \"hard champ\" or a \"skill champ\" based on \"mechanics.\" I shouldn't need to explain why they're idiots who deserve a Garen ult to the dome.\n\nYour word is \"positioning.\" That's your catchphrase. Lux is like Fonzie or Joey Tribbiani. Her catchphrase is \"positioning.\" Although, I won't fault you if you type \"How you doin'\" in all chat every time you snipe someone with your ult.\n\nPositioning is your ability to constantly stand in the right spot. Specifically, it's your ability to always stand so that your opponents are incapable of reaching you, but you can abuse your massive ability ranges to damage them or ~~watch your pet apes feed and then W afterward to taunt them~~ shield allies. That distance isn't static; it changes based on several things. Do they have their gap closer up? If it's on cooldown, that will drastically increase your ability to threaten them. Do you have your Q up? That's going to give you some more room to move around, I'll talk about that soon. Do you know where their jungler is? I haven't seen Nidalee mid in awhile, you mentioned her. If you know Nidalee just ganked top you have a lot more \"right spots\" in bot lane/the side of mid closest to bot than if you haven't seen her in awhile.\n\nOffensively, good positioning lets you step up and poke your opponent down. Zed, Diana, Ekko, any mid assassin, it's your job to use the levels where they don't have a gap closer to hit them every time it's safe to do so. You cannot fight them 1v1 once they hit 6. Against some, like Fizz or Zed, you cannot fight them once they hit 3. The same is true of most kill supports as support Lux. At Level 6 Alistar can just dive your tower because he feels like it. Pyke isn't all that different from Leblanc, Fizz or Zed. Does this mean Lux is unplayable? Absolutely not. You just have to constantly watch how close you get, and every time it's safe, hit them with your E when they go to last hit.\n\nA side note, but an important one: don't be one of those Lux players that wastes her passive. It has no cooldown and it scales really well. If you can safely walk up, autoattack, and back out, do so. If you land a Q, throw your E out, auto, pop the E, auto, run away. I see so many Lux players fall behind in matchups they can't afford to because they miss opportunities to proc her passive their opponent can't punish.\n\nDefensively, good positioning isn't just a matter of respecting your opponent's zones. It's about layering defenses too. Every layer of defenses is extra room you have to position further out. Let's go over them, in no particular order:\n\n* Your Q. Not every champion has Yasuo or Fizz levels of Lux counterplay. A root has a lot of stopping power, especially against short-ranged champions. When Q is on cooldown, you need to BACK AWAY. Respect gap closers. Respect Flash. If you are using Q offensively, it's because you KNOW they cannot retaliate before it's available again. Hold your Q for the gap closer, back away, hit them, back away more. Whether or not a Q successfully lands, you MUST position further back until it's ready again.\n\n* Stand behind teammates. I'm sorry if you knew this already, but it's worth stating that in teamfights, you should not be in front of anyone. If your ADC is about to take a lethal Cait ult, and you're SURE you can block it, fine. Your position in fights is close enough to your ADC that neither of you gives Kha'Zix bonus damage, and if they're going full ape, just stand in the back at maximum E range and be ready to run. Your front line will probably pass you if they panic and flee because of higher movement speed, so learn how to spot when a fight is going bad and start backing up if you don't think your Fighters and Tanks will go down swinging.\n\n* Control Wards. So much. I guarantee you are not warding enough as Lux. Of all the characters to not leave base with 75+ gold and no Control Ward, that would be Lux. I haven't been playing Lux lately, but this is the single thing I am practicing right now, is never leaving base without a Control Ward if I can. You can hold 2 in your inventory. Have one on the map at all times. You have room for it. If you have a Dark Seal, Corrupting Potion, Boots/Cloth Armor/Null Mantle, and you have enough for 2 Amp Tomes and a Mana Crystal but not a Control Ward? Grab 2 Control Wards, finish Lost Chapter on your next recall. The vision will let you stay in lane more than some mana/20 AP.\n\n* Farsight Alteration. Every game. When you hit Level 9. Someone's going to disagree with me here, and say something about situational play. No. You are Lux. By the time you can see someone off a yellow trinket ward, you are probably dead already. Teemo shrooms? Buy a Banshee's Veil and let your minions and teammates be walking minesweepers; you should be positioning behind them anyway.\n\n* Stat Shards. Choose 5 Armor or 6 MR based on lane opponent. Despite having such low base health, laning phase is when your health pool matters most. Your goal is to inflate that tiny Walmart wading pool as much as humanly possible without gimping yourself. Health/level is a trap. You are using the Stat Shard that can't be AP to nullify opposing poke. Going against Zed? You can't stop him from nuking you with Electrocute, but with 5 armor and an Armguard, hitting you with a lone Shuriken is Zed attacking his own energy. Fighting against Diana? 6 MR means as long as you're dodging most of her Qs and not getting in melee, she cannot do anything to you without her jungler until 6. 6 MR against Leblanc means every Q she doesn't follow up on is a joke. Your defensive Stat Shard is there to help you survive lane. Use it.\n\n* Flash. Flash is a double-edged sword, because your opponent with a gap closer benefits more from it than you. Respect their Flash, and use your own sooner rather than later. If you see a Rammus hurtling out of a side bush, don't wait until after he taunts you to Flash. Losing your Flash to Kayn's W is a much better penalty for not having wards up than losing your life to his R. \n\n* Repeat after me: Hourglass will not help me if I overextend, it's a tool to survive sloppy dives. Again: Hourglass will not help me if I overextend, it's a tool to survive sloppy dives. OK, that said, rush this item against Zed, Fizz, Diana, Pantheon, Talon, Jayce, Nocturne Jungle, Xin Zhao Jungle. If it's a Diver or Assassin, who does Physical damage or lacks a reliable form of Magical poke (Fizz, Diana), rush {{item:3157}} . The mana you lose from not getting Lost Chapter first doesn't matter. If they waste all their cooldowns on a failed dive, they are either dead, recalling, or easily poked out of lane with your remaining mana. Sit on Armguard vs Yasuo, if he ults you you're probably just dead.\n\n* Bans. On that note, what are you banning if not Fizz or Yasuo? Irelia is way too strong, but your kit lets you poke her with impunity if she doesn't have Flash up; you have a much easier time dealing with a fed Irelia than most characters. Pyke? Pyke can be hard to deal with if you don't have a lot of vision. Use this as an opportunity to practice positioning based on who your wards see (and who they don't see). Akali? OK, but wait and see if a teammate bans her before she gets through champ select. Galio? Darius? Lmao no. Leblanc? Lucian? I won't lie, they'll dumpster you if you give them a single opportunity. Not worth a ban, worth playing safe. _Yasuo and Fizz who have multiple abilities in their kits that straight up negate your ability to control space while still attacking you, and can use this to repeatedly gain tempo on you, regardless of how well you play._ Hopefully, Akali gets her shroud nerfed, but until then, wait for a teammate to ban her; in a game state without such massive outliers you are using yours on Fizz or Yasuo.\n\n* Summoner Spells. Every time I see {{summoner:14}} on Lux I scream internally. Ignite has 600 range. Q has 1175. E has 1000. R has 3340. NO IGNITE. If I'm dumb enough to die to a Lux with Ignite, I'm probably dumb enough to stay in lane and die to her next E. Even if your opponent somehow manages to fall into the narrow band of derp where they die to Ignite but are smart enough to recall if you don't take it, _that's fine_. Get more cs. Get some plates. Put some wards down. Shove the wave and go buy items. ABC: Always Barrier Chimps. I've seen arguments for Exhaust against Assassins. Personally, I like Barrier. You're getting Hourglass anyway, Barrier lets you negate that one time they get an Electrocute proc and then smack Leblanc/Zed/whoever around with full health while their gap closer is down.\n\nI wish I could give more useful advice. A lot of this comes down to practice and developing a sense of good positioning. Turns out mechanically easy champs can take skill to play. Practice positioning, make sure you're last hitting every minion your opponent will let you have, and aiming your spells when they go to last hit or smack your teammates.\n\nHappy New Year!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cats Are Food","date":"2019-01-01T15:43:45.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right?
