I have had 30 kill games and i&#039;ve had 15 death games, I&#039;ve fed my ass off, and I&#039;ve carried hard. Neither of those make me a better or worse person\r\n\r\nPlayers who are bad at this game do not deserve to be scolded. If your bot lane has a 41% winrate, then they&#039;re just gonna sink until they&#039;re in proper MMR or they improve. if they&#039;re feeding their ass off you do not have any obligation, or duty, or honestly any form of magic highground to insult and demean those people.\r\n\r\nImagine this: you&#039;re getting stomped by someone far better than you in lane, you&#039;re trying your best but you&#039;re just getting fucked, you&#039;re not that good and no matter what you do you get completely and utterly descimated\r\n\r\nOk, well that sucks, you feel like shit.. Now imagine that your team, who you feel you&#039;re letting down, starts being like &quot;GG report bot&quot; or &quot;Omg feeding bot just stay under tower&quot;. What the fuck is that gonna do to your mood? \r\n\r\nok so here&#039;s where it gets... better\r\n\r\nIf you want to say something, say words of encouragement, either tactical input (Though don&#039;t expect it to manifest in that match) or maybe offer a lane swap. Maybe say some words to raise the moral of that teammate like &quot;Hey guys just hold the tower, I&#039;m gonna finish my lane and get you to your power spikes&quot;\r\n\r\ndon&#039;t be a dick, it&#039;s just being civil. If you lose a game because of &#039;shitters&#039; then whatever, you&#039;ll probably win the next one right? Are you really playing just for MMR? Or are you playing to enjoy the game?\r\n\r\nnext up is the honest to goodness truth. You&#039;ve been matched with these people, which means over the course of your gameplay you have been tagged as the same level of skill as them, either that&#039;s a massive glitch and you should be challeng0r, or maybe these people are just on a slump, and you&#039;re actually just as bad or good as them.\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;re gonna care about only wins, then act like it and don&#039;t cry about the issues, a winner takes what he&#039;s got and makes it work more often than not, a loser... well a loser gets a setback and gives up, goes home, and cries to grandma.\r\n\r\nIf somebody is not griefing, *inting* (Not just feeding, but INTENTIONALLLY feeding, with obvious admittance of their actions), or otherwise trying to make your life worse then you don&#039;t even have any level of justification, within the rules or outside of them, to open your malice filled shit eating piehole and trash talk them. \r\n\r\nDid you gank mid and the mid laner didn&#039;t go in with you? Well tough shit, he&#039;s bad, whatever get over it. If you&#039;re so fucking good you&#039;ll climb. \r\n\r\nDid you get camped top lane and lose because jungle was only ganking mid and bot? Well fucking deal with it, man up and win the game. You have a personal setback and you need to just play with this. The enemy team *Wants* you to tilt. It&#039;s actually perfectly fair to have &#039;competitive banter&#039;, and flash masteries, every time you roam and kill someone, because if they tilt, they&#039;ve just thrown.\r\n\r\nDid the 0/4 tristana just fucking throw the game for your team because she got shit on in lane? Well then, if you&#039;re so much better than her, why didn&#039;t you make your enemy lane opponent 0/10 too? because statistically, the enemy is as bad as your team.\r\n\r\nif you&#039;re so worried about how OP a fed adc is then start playing adc and winning mr good. Also in that game maybe you should just go follow your braindead no-skill adc and get them a bunch of kills and assists so they can start no-skilling the enemy team to death.\r\n\r\nYeah some people are just bad... but there&#039;s a part of that sentence...&quot;people&quot;.\r\n\r\nDon&#039;t be a dick\r\n\r\n~Ub3r","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Shingetsu","date":"2018-03-26T23:49:49.978+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":1,"body":"Often times, \"bad\" players know what they're doing and are having an off game, yet people trash them as though they're doing it on purpose or are complete noobs.

For the record, the point of my \"being smart\" wasn't for its own sake. It was an attempt to show you in practice that some things aren't possible for some people. The ADC is having a bad game. Maybe it's the matchup. Maybe it's subconscious distractions. Maybe he's just learning the role. Whatever the case, it's entirely possible they aren't (yet) capable of doing what you suggest effectively. That doesn't mean they're being bad on purpose.","replies":[{"poster":"Hibeki","date":"2018-03-28T00:40:50.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah no, maybe in low elo.

If you were truly so bad at the game as this discussion presupposes, would you be in high ELO to begin with? It don't care how \"boosted\" you are, you won't stay there long if you play solo queue long enough.\n\nIf circumstances allow a boosted player to remain elevated beyond his substantial potentiality, that's on Riot and there's nothing you, I, or anyone else without a paycheck from Riot can do about it. Learn to deal with it. That's the entire point of the argument. That learning to deal with it - and I stress deal with it, not merely tolerate it - will make for more enjoyable games, and more frequent wins.\n\nSomeone who bitches about a problem and lashes out at those who offer solutions doesn't want things to change, he merely wants to act out. This is behavioral regression to a neonate state, and should probably be avoided for the health of oneself and one's friends.","replies":[{"poster":"Hibeki","date":"2018-03-28T05:08:25.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I dont expect a silver player to understand evrything and i give them some slack.\n\nBut what I have a problem with is when the silver player is told what they can do to prevent that and dont listen to the solution.

This is literally the only competitive environment in the *fucking world* like this. To say 'this is how it should be' is total dogshit, because this pc garbage only works in an environment where the bad stop being able to play because no teams will take them.\n\nYou have an expectation to meet. Its not on everyone else to cope with your god awful play. Its on YOU to bring your skill and play up to that expectation *you put yourself in*. End of story.

So let me clear that up right now.\n\nAs for the rest of this, you're not wrong, except your taking it a bit too seriously. You're talking about a hobby. Can you imagine if kids playing tag on the playground expected such perfection of one another? Can you imagine if a pair of friends bowling against a couple of guys in the alley were this harsh on one another? No, because it's absurd.\n\nVideo games were invented for children. They've since become the hobby of young adults, but that doesn't really matter, because even adult hobbies aren't taken this seriously. No one tells their buddy in fishing competition, \"YOU HAVE A JOB TO DO. YOU HAVE EXPECTATIONS. YOU KNEW THIS WHEN YOU GOT IN THE BOAT. CATCH SOME FUCKING FISH OR SWIM BACK TO SHORE ON YOUR OWN, I'M NOT CARRYING DEAD WEIGHT.\"\n\nLeague of Legends and Overwatch are PC environments because they're entertainment before they're competition. Riot and Blizzard make their money off of people enjoying the game. When serious players rip the less stalwart apart for poor play, they stop playing, and the companies lose money. Obviously, a company is going to protect its profit margins above all else. \"Well I'll stop playing if they don't let me criticize.\" Well and good, except the company cares less about you.\n\nStatistically, the vast majority of prosaic victual emolument comes from the casual players who just want a good time. Competitive games are simply the old single-player console games you'd play as a kid, with the added element of allowing you to test yourself against other players. Casual players won't play a video game expecting to get ripped apart in the hopes if improving their performance. You're addressing competitive gaming like it's the same as professional sports. Pro football demands a great deal of its players because money is on the line. If a guy in a pickup game said to his teammates anything you've said here, they'd leave to go play with people who knew how to enjoy themselves.\n\nYou have expectations to meet in a career because the company's profits are on the line, and with them, goods and services for the masses. You have expectations to meet on the battlefield because lives are at risk. You have expectations to meet in professional sports because you're being paid millions of dollars to entertain the masses at peak performance levels. You have expectations to meet when studying because your own livelihood is at stake, and the reputation of the university suffers if its graduates go nowhere in life. In everyday life, there are absolutely cases in which putting aside \"PC garbage\" could stand to be cast aside, and saying it's a \"dog eat dog world\" is relevant.\n\nA video game is not one of them.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"NaughtyWord","date":"2018-03-28T02:40:30.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I see an ADC with 10+ deaths, 9 times out of 10, it is that way because nobody is peeling for them in team fights.

My latest Jax game last night? I bought pink ward to help with 4-man blue invade at my Amumu’s blue and they had a teemo jungler, thresh support, lux mid. I had ignite and barrier. Despite taking E first, I managed to die after all the invade stuff cleared off (not first blood), minion block at level one when lux hit 2 before me.\n\nI had a ROUGH time, constantly roaming bot to help Lucian out, get vision, etc. Eventually was level 5 when lux was 8 and most everyone else was 6 or 7. I had GARBAGE CS but knew I had to build damage despite taking tanky runes to earn gold for a proper mid game to late-game.\n\nI died a few more times to sacrificing myself for shutdown gold and lost first turret. But damn we got every damn dragon (sucky double air/double ocean) and rift herald, even a baron. I had to mute ping spamming rage jungler and support volibear who kept throwing up surrender votes and flaming team but I helped Sion top push turrets and followed Lucian as he wandered trying to farm where he could. We mostly ignored bot lane since Amumu and Voli constantly overcommitted to protecting it unless there were free kills and we just HAPPENED to be in the area.\n\nI was surprised to get highest vision score because of just how much I warded, cleared, and pink’d anything whenever it was discovered. I avoided flighting Lux like the plague and abused teemo not understanding he cannot all-in me alone as I build myself like an assassin.\n\nI WANTED to give 2 people choice words but I didn’t. I just muted, and kept using hit-and-run tactics (as did Lucian), pushed turrets as I could, and REFUSED to take needless risks once we got starting stabilizing and getting ahead. We didn’t need a third person feeding because of stubbornness and impatience.\n\nI bet if I just did the same old stuff I usually do to adapt to the situation, the game would have dragged on too long and we’d get outscaled.\n\nThat game took me totally out of my comfort zone and I dare say it was healthy and informative how being put on the defensive so early and often gave me clarity.\n\nStill stressful as hell and I don’t want to repeat the experience but I am glad I saw it for what it was: a chance to prove how to learn my limits.\n\nEdit: And yes, we won.","replies":[]},{"poster":"tunehunter","date":"2018-03-27T06:49:49.850+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"From a bad player (lucked into gold v in seasons 5 and 6, but mostly play at silver 3 or lower) I have to say thank you for this. I do feel bad sometimes that the game still puts me at mmr's I do not think I deserve because I am extremely lucky with team mates that can carry time after time because my bad plays really do hurt my team, but I am not doing it on purpose. I am just playing the best I can and that just isn't that amazing. I do enjoy this game from time to time because amazingly I have found a lot of nice people playing. For a game known for its toxicity there are a surprising number of nice people that are just trying to have fun. Maybe that is part of my luck as well.
