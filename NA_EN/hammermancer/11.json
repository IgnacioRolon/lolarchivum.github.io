Map skins are dirt cheap and personal, noone else sees them but it&#039;s just for you\r\n2.) Map skins are voted on by both teams, with the winning skin on each team taking their half of the map and river dividing it all (Maybe some layer effects on river?)\r\n3.) Map skins are voted on by both teams with the one winning skin being the used skin\r\n4.) Map skins are assigned based on your lane, if you are assigned top lane then your &#039;map skin&#039; will apply to your section of top lane. Junglers also get creature skins\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy in the fuck would you want to make map skins?\r\n\r\nWell because i stare at the same map every game, and even just a simple tileset retexture/reskin would be great.  Riot can make money too!\r\n\r\nImagine the beehive for beemo, candy land for ivern (The candy king), weird science labs, all of which could be thematic. Nobody in any elo that&#039;s reasonable to balance around would be confused if blue buff looked like an angry gingerbread man instead of an angry golem","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-18T19:35:47.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Map skins are technologically complex, have large file sizes, and would need constant updates and bug fixing. Likely a huge redesign of how the maps are handled just to make it feasible to switch them out without tons of constant maintenance.","replies":[]}]}
