If the losing side starts winning then he will go to the previous winning side and inspire them. I don’t think he fights for the weak because of its the right thing to do but because more bloodshed and death makes him more powerful I guess. If the whole humans die I think he will like that very much lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Hammermancer","date":"2018-06-02T12:54:01.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that's what i mean, i always thought it was interesting and would love to see him have to fight along side the aspects of targon in some dire threat","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lady Faceless","date":"2018-06-02T12:41:02.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right now we have no idea in which direction the narrative wanna go with Aatrox.
