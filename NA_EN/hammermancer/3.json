I&#039;m not saying people are particularly intelligent who fall for this, but I&#039;m not going to pretend like naivety deserves punishment. Clearly a little education could be used and some information campaigns could be very useful. Something on the load screen like Blizzard does.. maybe a tips on the start of the game, a warning message in grey font whenever &quot;.com&quot; or &quot;.net&quot; or anything similar, including with spaces, is detected by a macro chat read engine?\r\n\r\nit&#039;s kind of unheard of in the Multiplayer gaming community to not have awareness campaigns for this sort of thing. from MMOs to team shoots and hack and slash games there are almost universally &quot;Hey guys be really cautious about putting your account info anywhere&quot; posts that you&#039;ll see at least once a gaming session, without being interrupting or invasive.","replies":[{"poster":"cluvie","date":"2016-10-25T21:11:29.657+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey OP, \n\nWe do post things occasionally to try and raise awareness, especially for people that may be new to League or that don't check boards. Here's a cute campaign that was run by the EU team a few months ago: http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/account-security-education that I believe may have come from the BR region originally (don't quote me on that, I can't remember >_< !! ) We also have Knowledge Base articles that have a ton of tips as well.\n\nThere are warnings for clicking on links in the client too (before opening the browser).\n\nIt's good feedback to know that the cadence of these warnings may be less than ideal and that the penetration of the message does not seem to be reaching enough people. I'll see what else we can do to try and increase awareness elsewhere.
