So for a connectivity issue (Which is hard to believe my internet is fine right now) I get punished as if i lost a match, which is harsher than dodge punishment. I didn't dodge though\nI really want that LP back, because im in hell, where it takes an hour to get a game closed out as there just isn't enough coordination to do that final hole punch (On either side admittedly) \n\nso I just lost an hour of work because of that, please help me, I just got screwed so hard","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-04T16:23:21.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry you went through this, with LP and leaverbuster to boot.  :(  There were ISP issues last night, especially for those on the east coast.
