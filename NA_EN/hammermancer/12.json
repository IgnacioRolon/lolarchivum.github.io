How hard is it to find a middle ground between mickey mouse and thanos?\r\n\r\nand frankly, you say that people don&#039;t repeat offend, but i sincerely doubt it, because i still see toxic players regularly,  I generally only respond if i absolutely have to, like cheering on the dude that everyone else is bitching at because he went one fighter into another and died to a gank so now he&#039;s getting snowballed on and oneshot if he even tries to stand under his tower\r\n\r\nit&#039;s like\r\n\r\nthe fuck\r\n\r\neveryone needs fucking xanex or some shit\r\n\r\nPlay the game, smile, do some troll builds\r\n\r\nstop doing this shit with mobafire/skt copycat builds when tons of people don&#039;t even know why the builds happen or what they optimize\r\n\r\nstop bitching at eachother over this jenky ass imbalanced game and start being friends, who are here to play a fucking game\r\n\r\nseriously\r\n\r\nNothing makes me play worse than a toxic team, nothing makes me care less about winning than a toxic team. \r\n\r\nBut what does riot focus on? A dude makes a gay joke, boom permabanned immediately, a guy runs into games and calls everyone trash over and over? Maybe a chat restriction... maybe","replies":[]}
