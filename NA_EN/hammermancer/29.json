But it doesn't make sense for them to be friends. \nZac has high moral standards, thanks to his loving parents, and tries to be a hero in that suffering city. While Twitch is legit planning to kill every human being with poison in Zaun. This doesn't really match well together, in fact, it would make a great rivalry. Twitch could be the main antagonist for hero Zac. \n\nAnd keep in mind: With the lore update for Zaun, **Twitchs lore wasn't adressed**. His lore didn't get updated and all we got is that text of someone surviving an attack from him and went crazy because of it. If they expand his lore, making him a rival for Zac would just make perfect sense.\n\n____________________________________\n\n{{champion:164}} VS {{champion:6}} \nWe got Camille introduced before Urgots update, making him that creeping evil in the shadows of Zaun. And she seems to be **really** well informed about stuff that is going on in Piltover and Zaun. I think it is kind of unlikely that she doesn't find out about Urgot fairly soon, considering that he even has an own cult following him (the Sons of Ur) and is on a killing spree against chembarons.\n\nUrgot is causing chaos and fear in Zaun, he disturbs the balance which Camille tries to protect. Again, not canon yet, but it would make sense that they have an encounter some day and this would definitely not be a friendly tea party.\nBut I admit, this is the biggest stretch of my picks.\n\n_________________________________\n\n{{champion:27}} VS {{champion:19}} \nHell, no, they definitely didn't work together.\nYou are thinking about Warwicks old lore, which changed with his VGU.\nIn the updated version, Warwick was once a criminal and got caught by Singed, then transformed in a cruel experiment into the beast we know today (by mixing some animal genes like wolf, fox and bat into his bloody system).\n\nIt went so far that Warwick died during the experiment and Singed threw him in the trash as a \"fail\". But the mixture in his venes resurrected Warwick and since then he is running through the streets of Zaun, trying to kill chembarons and keeping control over the wild animal he has become.\n\nSo it is very unlikely that Warwick has any friendly feelings for Singed.\n\n_____________________________\n\n{{champion:36}} VS {{champion:245}} \nYes, they just met once. But I thought that Dr. Mundos thought of Ekko as \"patient zero\" is quite interesting and it couldn't hurt to keep this whole thing as a rivalry between them. Dr. Mundo feels extremely isolated in his lore, lacking interactions with other champions. And I think that this one has a great dynamic, they should expand on this.","replies":[{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2018-07-04T23:14:50.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:164}} is probably neutral to {{champion:6}} \n\nShe strives to keep piltover in an advancing state and doing any jobs she acquires towards removing problems.\n\nUrgot you'd have to look at and question if he's a problem, cause are chembarons really good? If Camille can go around assassinating people that disrupt piltover, isn't urgot technically doing a similar job? Again this is a matter of whether or not chembaron are considered good or bad guys, I don't recall any good lore about chembarons, just everybody wants to kill them (urgot, warwick, possibly twitch and zac.) and some chembarons have even created their own problems.\n\nI doubt camille would care either, since the reason the chembarons are down there is so they don't pollute and disrupt the progress of piltover and basically turn it into zaun, they're out of her way so until urgot comes up and decides to wreck havoc, which Idk if he's interested in doing (seems just pissed with zaun and noxus), camille probably just has an eye on him at best, if he keeps people in line then he's not making things worse. \n\nShe' probably more concerned with Ekko, since who knows maybe his time traveling can cause some problems. Jinx she's definitely hunting down probably.

He is a major threat for the whole city, he even gathers an own cult.\nUrgot is a cruel murderer who doesn't discriminate, he kills everyone he can get in his grasp to test them of their worth. \n\nI think there is absolutely no way that she is neutral to someone who threatens the city that much.\nAnd keep in mind that Zaun and Piltover are intertwined with each other. It's not like Camille doesn't care about the things going on in Zaun, since these oftenly will affect the city above as well. Zaun and Piltover are dependant of each other and she knows that.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2018-07-03T19:44:39.492+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We also had GP vs MF.","replies":[]}]}
