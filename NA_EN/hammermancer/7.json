Essence reaver before offered first lifesteal and mana sustain, then it offered the crit synergy allowing PD, IE, and Tri to work well with it (Before tri was swapped to a stinger from a zeal)\n\nNow jayce is forced into a very unhealthy build which more or less functions as Lethality varus\n\nOld ER was significantly more effective on jayce than it is now, it only serves as a crutch now for people who are learning the champ.\n\njayce by the way is likely the most manastarved AD champion in the game, and his itemization is so poor for mana that it in conjunction with the frankly poorly implemented lethality items forces him to go 1-2 lethality items, cleaver, Lord doms or Mortal reminder, and usually a GA.
