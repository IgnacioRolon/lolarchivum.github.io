This is not big as a problem in the Top 1% of players because they are all already very good. We all experienced games where we have someone who is intentionally throwing the game and corrupting the teammates happiness and they start tilting. We always wonder how someone think its okay to \"Try something new\" in a ranked game, or even something they are not comfortable or experienced with to play.\r\n\r\nBanning people does not solve anything, new accounts are always made. People want to \"Smurf\" to satisfy their need to stomp on people, but then if they troll and dont care about the conciseness because its not their \"Main\" account.  There is definitely a Big Toxic community in the lower rankings. Reporting people doesn't seem to do the Trick i feel like. And Matchmaking will never be accurate because noone is their actually rank. \r\n\r\nLeague is defiantly an Amazing and Fun game to play and noone want to stop, but can we draw a line between with Competitive/Ranked and Fun/Normals? I am defiantly guilty of what i am frustrated about too, i have taken Teemo top becuase my last game went horrible and i just wanted to do something fun but i did it in ranked hoping \"maybe ill win\" but i could have easily went into a Normal game and had fun there without holding Teammates back, losing them their LP, and mostly Hurting them emotional y and spiritually. \r\n\r\nI do not know what Riot does to people 100% but from what i hear \"2 week Ban\" \"5 game chat restrictions\". That does not seem to solve anything. People have more than 1 account. Getting around Riots punishment is easy unless Riot is constantly Hunting you down like they did Tyler1 even when he was trying to just have fun and be off radar.  IP Banning someone seems harsh but banning a single account does not accomplish anything. \r\n\r\nAll i really want is small punishments, if a team finds somone who is trolling they can maybe vote for him to lock him out of Future Ranked games, like a Timer. No ranked games for the next 2H's but keep Normals avalible? You are thinking that maybe 4 guys can team up on 1 guy and just ruin his day. Yes there can flaws to  system, but at least lets make a system that Protects Ranked Games. \r\n\r\none Idea that i have and i think ive seen it in a different game was that you can not take a Champion that u arent Mastery Lv5+ into a ranked game. i feel like it would upset a lot of people to learn more champs before they can hop into ranked but then we dont get the ones who says \"i never played __ before, idk wtf im doing\" \r\n\r\nThanks for listening to my Rant of the Day","replies":[]}
