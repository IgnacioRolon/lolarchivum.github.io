Its a myriad of reasons, the gold itself makes fuck all of a difference. The issue at hand is, once you lose the first tower, the map begins to unravel. This causes you to lose vision control of your own jungle, and with damage being so ridiculous, gaining it back becomes very hard because you get exploded for leaving your safe zone. Not to mention the low quality of vision nowadays, like for instance, if you look back at old lcs games, or tournament games, any come from behind wins, or game turn arounds were done by lighting the map up and avoiding fighting. With the low amount of vision, you are bound to walk into somebody, or find yourself in an awkward position eventually. The changes over the last couple seasons were all a factor to this. Reducing vision to make supports not feel like walking ward bots, even though they are essentially the only class that buys sightstone in random pub games, and they are only limited to 3 wards and 1 pink, which in essence is little to no vision, and you constantly need to recall to refill the charges. Adding keystones, and pumping masteries with just outright flat damage increases across the board was another factor, and then now with most assassins being too high risk for a much lower reward, and having adcs not being necessary for tower killing anymore, and the games ending before they can take over the games, just snowballed into what we have now. \n\n\nThe way to combat this begins with towers, and making them have higher resistances, and either more damage, or more AS, and have the towers past tier 1 be stronger and stronger as you take them down. there is not logical reason for nexus towers to be the same strength as tier 1 towers, the next step is re-evaluate vision. Why do i need an item slot for a pink ward? or a ward in general for that matter. Their trinket system was not what people wanted, however the first iteration was completely fine, and essentially similar to what people wanted. Both yellow upgrades was the most balanced thing the game ever had for vision, and they went and shit all over that for no reason. Nobody bought blue trinket, so they thought, better overhaul the whole thing instead of fixing that one trinket to do something else. The third step, is to lower damage, and retool how keystones and masteries work in general. Masteries should not be your go to damage tools. They should be a choice between a handful of things, and they should not be an extra passive ability. they should just be passive stat games, and should not have any kind just extra damage added to them. I don't have a problem with damage increases, like the 5% for 2.5% even though that is kind of a silly trade off, it should not be, your abilities deal more damage on top of what they say in the tooltip. Things like deathfire touch are almost like hidden power, a thing they were quite against at one point.","replies":[]},{"poster":"the weeaboo","date":"2017-01-29T23:02:29.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes please I dont care about fucking watching the game when I could be playing it","replies":[]}]}
