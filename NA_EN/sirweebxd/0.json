I pressed enter, I got banned... I never used any scripts, elo boosts (this account is level 29), or anything that was unfair, and I never flamed anyone and I never got a suspension for being toxic because I wasn't, why was I banned? I know you're all about to say \"Well why don't you just look in your email, YOU DUMB OR SOMETHING?!\", Riot never emailed me telling me why I got banned. I think this is suspicious, rito plz help mae.\r\n\r\n{{champion:141}} -\"Hi i'm edgy\"\r\n\r\nLol, (rito, every player thinks that this guy is very edgy, luv it &lt;3)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-17T01:52:50.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well hey there again SirDevilRS.
