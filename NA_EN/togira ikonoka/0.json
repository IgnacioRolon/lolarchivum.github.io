Trying to escape a bad team fight or run from a gank?  Need to run through the jungle? Oh, you flashed into baron pit and it aggro&#039;d and shat all over you because of your Sunfire aura? Not anymore.\n\n...Anyway, those are my thoughts.  Anyone else agree/disagree?\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Mmm Broccoli,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WaUiZMzr,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2015-04-12T20:45:01.818+0000)\n> \n> What I'm saying is when you turn off the aura, you're turning off the damage.  The only reason people get Sunfire Cape as opposed to Randuin's Omen is the aura - it's the upside.  When you toggle it off, you're reversing the upsides and downsides.  You turn off the aura, which takes away the damage and the identity of the item but opens up windows of opportunity for other types of play.\n\nAnother idea I've had in regards to Cinderhulk... have Sunfire Cape have a toggle, but every time you turn it on and off, it has to ramp the damage up to its full potential, similar to Cinderhulk, but still retaining the toggle ability.  This way, someone can't just turn it off, dive you, and turn it back on for full, unavoidable damage.  It would have to take a few seconds for either the damage to take effect or for the damage to become something of a threat instead of negligible.\n\nTL;DR - The person who's using Sunfire Cape should be able to choose whether or not they want all the downsides that come with the upsides of the aura, not be forced to play around them.","replies":[{"poster":"Uracle","date":"2015-04-13T02:14:27.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":20,"body":"The first toggle item to ever be in this game.

See if the added complexity either removes or adds strategic diversity and counterplay, or is more of a nuisance than a useful tool.

That's what I don't understand. Also, forgetting its a toggle ability is the players fault. Also, what downside are you trying to mention about not having toggle sunfire cape?","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-04-14T22:19:51.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I already explained all three of those. Sunfire's passive has its counterplay, and can be used by both its owner and the opponent for an advantage. Yes, forgetting to toggle it would be the player's fault, but the point I made earlier is that it adds a layer of complexity that might not be necessary. \n\nHaving a toggle promotes smart playing because it could be used in ways you wouldn't consider. For the owner, it forces them to consider their path through the jungle if they're trying to escape, as it aggros monsters. As someone who has used this before, you can see which camps are resetting and track someone's path like so if you don't have enough wards in your jungle or the opposing jungle. If someone has sunfire's cape and pushes you to tower, you can also enter melee range (if they're trying to avoid getting tower aggro) to immediately aggro them, beginning a trade that they will lose if they stay within your tower's range. \n\nIt aids in pushing, but can also unwillingly push a wave if you stand too close to the minions. This can make it easier for an opponent to freeze a lane in their favor and force you to overextend, or zone you out from your minions when you back away as to not push out your minions too far. \n\n**Am I making sense here? This is just my opinion, like anyone else's. I'm not someone on the balancing team, so I don't have any data or research. I'm just a guy who thinks the item is just fine the way it is, that's all.**\n\nI don't think I understood your third question perfectly, though, unless you're referring to \n\n>And the downsides give counterplay (tracking people with sunfire's isn't too hard in the jungle if you look for camps that are resetting), plus if someone is pushing your tower you can get tower aggro on them just by walking near them and taking a little bit of damage (like Irelia hitting Q on Shen, making her tower target him since she got touched by the passive).\n\nThe downsides is that sunfire's cape causes camps to aggro then reset, causes tower aggro if you're in melee range of a champion (someone, for instance, could use a gap closer like Irelia's Q to hit you for a trade, but you would lose it if you try to retaliate because of the tower already firing at you). It can be used by your opponents as a form of counterplay, rather than purely benefit you. It was just an interesting interaction I liked, and cared to mention. It's not a huge deal, if Riot chose to change it to a toggle, because sunfire's can be countered offensively with itemization, and defensively with simple magic resist.\n\nNow, are we done? I neither want to piss anyone off or get pissed off for something as petty as a discussion over a single item of a video game, so please no hard feelings over this. If you got something to contribute on your side of the discussion, or just want to ask me something, go ahead. But at the very least respect my opinion.\n\nAnd I will admit, toggling should at least be looked into, if not this item then for another. If Riot decides it not unneeded complexity, it *could* lead to some interesting mechanics. Reminds me of Ashe's frost shot, and I wonder if there could be an item that drains your mana while it's toggled for some passive or on-hit ability. I'm not completely opposed to the idea of toggled items, I'm hesitant, though certainly more curious after hearing others' opinions on the matter.","replies":[{"poster":"Virgin Ray","date":"2015-04-15T02:54:22.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what your telling me is that if its toggled it would deem to OP because you can control the enemy minions and can stop agro from camp monsters? So do you WANT a downside to Sunfire cape because of the counterplay you can use with the enemy burning your minions causing them to overextend?\n\n Well it does make sense, would you look at it the same way if toggling it doesn't mean using mana. I mean it makes sense if RIOT makes {{item:3068}} use mana, but do you hate toggle because it MIGHT require mana while toggled? Or if it doesn't need mana, would you like the idea of a toggled sunfire cape?\n \n What I think is that it should be toggled for more efficiancy in minion clearing or strategic plays by the freedom of toggling it on or off. I mean RIOT never puts any downsides to abilities, the only downside is that someone can counter that ability using plays and analyzing strengths and weakneeses you have in the game.\n\n What I mean is RIOT never puts abilities like TF2 Weapons, where its like lets say 50% more ammo, but 30% less damage. Usually RIOT would just tell us a tip about how to counter that ability or item using this and that. Like I dont know if Lee sin spams his q and keeps hitting you, gank him unexpectedly or play passivly until he overextends.\n\n Correct me if I am wrong, but what I think you are saying is that you want Sunfire Cape to have a weakness in itself by not toggling and having to take aggro from monsters as a price of it's fire AoE? I mean that's completly understandable, though I think  it's very odd for RIOT to be making TF2 like weapons. Where there is already a weakness and counterplay isn't a major thing to get rid of it. I think it's just the enemy team figuring a way out of how to counterplay the Sunfire cape. Toggle freedom just makes more plays and strategic setups for your team, and more efficiancy in my opinion.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Togira Ikonoka","date":"2015-04-12T22:51:20.596+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is, all those upsides are also downsides as well.

If you truly want to understand why sunfire cape is not a toggle item and what would have to be done to make it one, read this post in its entirety.\n\nBy including a toggle feature it would essentially allow you to obtain an additional ability to add to your kit simply by purchasing an item in game. One that would have 0 drawbacks whatsoever. there is no cost for activating it or deactivating it and no cost while it is on. Keep that in mind for my next examples.\n\nNow let us look at champions that have the potential to have an always on damage aura in their basic kits. There are only 2, Amumu with Despair and Dr. Mundo with Burning Agony.\n\nDespair costs Amumu mana to maintain. While it is possible to build certain items to allow him to keep despair on all the time, but it still **requires mana** to stay on. \n\nOn the flip side you have Burning Agony which costs Dr. Mundo health to maintain. Again it is possible to build certain items so that he can keep it on without losing health, but it will still **require health** to stay on (even though it is technically possible to drain yourself to 1 health and still have it active... that would just be dumb of someone to do though).\n\nBoth champions have area of effect damage abilities they can toggle but both have a cost to use. So why should Sunfire cape get the ability to toggle with no cost at all to the user, just because you had to buy it? sorry not enough.\n\nIf you still dont seem to understand and want to be able to toggle sunfire cape then lets propose a cost to having it active since you seem to want to have an additional ability on your kit. Mana and any other resource is out of the question since not every champion has a resource, what does that leave? health. Alright then, You want to be able to toggle sunfire cape, Okay it will just deal 50% of its aura damage to you while it is active. Sound like an item you want to buy now? You get the optimal playstyle you so desperately and lazily want, right?\n\nAs for your considering both sides of the equation... are you kidding me? the fact it deals damage all the time IS an upside for opponents WHEN someone with sunfire cape is attacking a tower. all you have to do is walk up to them, take a single second of damage and boom, instant turret aggro.\n\nIf sunfire could be toggled off it becomes a DOWNSIDE to opponents because the player with sunfire could build a double wave of minions and go to a turret and start attacking it. It now requires that one of the opposing teams key damage dealers to come and stop them from you taking their tower. Why? because sunfire cape is a tank item, it gives you a bunch of health and a bunch of armor which means sending a low damage support with poor clear or another tank with slow clear is pointless because the person with sunfire is just going to sit and attack the tower till either he is low health and has to fall back or takes the tower and falls back because, remember, he has a double wave of minions or maybe more worth of time to hit the tower without having to draw aggro from it.\n\nNow you are going to try and convince yourself, well that seems fair... Again not looking at the big picture. You are a tank that happens to have teleport, built a sunfire cape, and created a large minion wave so you can split push one of your opponents towers with the extra time the wave gives you. The opposing team now has to send the ADC, mid laner, jungler, or whoever can actually deal enough damage to beat you off of their turret before it falls. That leaves them at a disadvantage in numbers while the rest of your team split push another lane knowing a good damage dealer has to go to the other towers aid. That damage dealer shows up to defend the tower, you fall back and teleport to the rest of your team to dive the other team and get 2 turrets because of the FORCED disadvantage they are in.\n\nNow you are going to say \"but this already happens with sunfire cape now\"... you are right. You dont seem to see the difference though. since sunfire cape cant be \"toggled\" off it only takes one opponent of whatever strength to go to the towers rescue since they need only get close to you the aggressor in order for the turret to aggro onto you. \"but then you just do the same thing and teleport to your other teammates dive and blah blah blah.\" The difference this time is the opposing team sent the weakest link on their team to keep you from taking the turret leaving all the damage and danger to defend against the rest of your team. Which leaves them a better chance of turning a dive in their favor.\n\nI know I am being condescending, and to a certain extent that is on purpose. I do know and understand why you would like to have the ability to toggle sunfrie cape. It would be nice to get all of its benefits with none of its drawbacks. Those drawbacks **have** to be there though in order to maintain balance in the game. They keep it so that one item/champion does not become a must build/pick or ban in order to win the game for your team.","replies":[{"poster":"Togira Ikonoka","date":"2015-04-13T22:24:49.971+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except you STILL have yet to read my and others' proposals to fix the \"zero-drawback\" problem for it.

In place of AoE damage, you need to sacrifice the fact that you will push the lane, you are not entitled to AoE damage whenever it is convenient for you (Singed/Mundo/Swain), and Riot has acknowledged that.\n\nThe major counterplay is pushing a turret.

You push your lane harder whether you want to or not and, as has been said, makes tower diving more difficult. Add in a toggle and you will directly buff the item by eliminating these cons, and as such the item will probably have to be nerfed to make room. If you recognize it as a buff and are willing to let the numbers be brought down then by all means keep going, I personally disagree though.","replies":[{"poster":"Togira Ikonoka","date":"2015-04-13T03:23:30.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As I've said before, a suitable nerf would be to make it so that every time you toggle it off, the damage has to ramp back up after a few seconds to get back to full potential.  A flat nerf could work as well, but I feel like they could actually increase the radius or something if they nerf the damage up front.\n\n...Or you could just give it a few second cooldown.  Or both.  That's not up for me to really decide, haha.  I'm just theorycrafting at this point.","replies":[{"poster":"Stray Kat","date":"2015-04-13T04:18:36.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about possibly having half of the armor removed when it's toggled off as well? Or even all of it.  The health could be constant, but remove some/all of the armor if the Aura is off.  Turning it off to not push would then open up chances for your opponent to do a little extra damage, in exchange for you not pushing/getting instant tower agro.","replies":[{"poster":"Togira Ikonoka","date":"2015-04-13T04:36:02.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All of it would be a bit harsh, but a fun way to do it would be to make it so that during the cooldown of the toggle the bonus armor gets removed and slowly ramps up (instead of the sunfire damage).\n\nSo, for example, it gives 30 armor but when you toggle it off it gives 0, then 5, then 10, then 15, etc. til back to 30 again and the aura would be back up.","replies":[{"poster":"Narasimha","date":"2015-04-14T02:29:57.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then no one would turn it off because their lane opponent would capitalize the hell out of that, and then we're back to square 1.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"thinking man","date":"2015-04-12T21:19:21.337+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"The point is that you can't buy an extremely powerful dueling item for lane without giving your opponent a way to safely farm.","replies":[{"poster":"Togira Ikonoka","date":"2015-04-12T21:22:29.017+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"I don't see how this removes their ability to farm.
