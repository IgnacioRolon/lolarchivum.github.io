If what you want was implemented the objectives would essentially become meaningless.  This is because by the time they were contested (if at all) with your suggested changes but under current game pacing standards the game would have already been decided or maybe one dragon fight would be decisive.  The buffs themselves wouldn't be useful because the team that acquired them really didn't need it to steamroll the team who's already lost.\n\nTL:DR\n\nI think monster objectives have gotten weaker due to game pacing picking up.  If monster objectives became stronger game pacing would have to be changed or they wouldn't have any impact on the outcome of a game 90% of the time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Raiyza","date":"2018-03-27T16:56:33.638+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its really sad.

Players in Solo Q are already soooo bad a ending games there is no reason to make it even more difficult. yeah its great when you can catch back up and win but its soo agonizingly painful when your team has no clue how to win a game and just run it down mid until the other team catches up or they get lucky and break the base. \n\npeople crying that dragon shouldn't be soloable until high levels is stupid the objective wouldn't even be worth going for at that point especially if its anything other than maybe an infernal.
