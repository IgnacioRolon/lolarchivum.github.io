On the playing side this feels ok. I want to get to a champion: \"boom\" now I'm there -> instantly death spin them. Meanwhile on the receiving end there is not time to respond to this action in anyway. Not even one single basic attack.\r\n\r\nAs I play I tend to feel rage in this moment. I don't feel like I'm playing a person who has skillfully beaten me in a dual but instead that I'm dealing with an unbalanced unfair mechanic.","replies":[{"poster":"Cerbearus","date":"2014-12-20T02:24:43.699+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNuWIZZaysU\n\nCounterplay?

It's how the character is viewed by the opponent. With shun po instantaneously dropping her upon you there isn't an ability to react to this. The only negative thing she suffers is that now she's in an aggressive position with a triggered cool down. No other champ has this ability with out landing some skill shot or using mana. I'm not asking much, but less than a second for our minds to accept that something has physically moved. If it weren't for the sound effect the current ability would seem like a glitch or a moment of lag.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Night Guard","date":"2014-12-20T01:39:41.287+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that Kat's counter in hard CC but that's not enough. When I play a champ that has one form of crowd control that takes multiple seconds to pull off I have no hope of stopping her, especially considering she can do three of her four abilities in .76 seconds, so even if I did have fast CC it'll never be faster than her instantaneous face rolls. I agree her ult is vulnerable to CC but frankly that doesn't matter if she can dispense death in less than a second without it just  by clicking three buttons but I can do nothing because there's no counter play to that except maybe an hourglass which will save you for a second but more than half the champs are AD so they have no protection.  Dying before I know what hit me takes the fun out of this game and without that there's little reason t keep playing it.","replies":[{"poster":"Brenticus12","date":"2014-12-20T08:08:09.122+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been playing a lot of Kassadin and alot of my matches were againsf Katarinas.

The visual shared of her actually moving between champion kill to champion kill would be more pleasing to watch and easier to comprehend in action. \n\nAnd maybe this \"in air time\" could function like a counter.

Just save your CC for her ult and she is basically shut down until she has it again because her damage is pretty Meh without her ult. Also if you have a dash or escape mechanic, also save that for her ult for the same reason as above. Her laning phase isn't that great compared to other Mid Champions, similar (yet a little better than) {{champion:84}} , especially after the damage nerf to her ult at lower levels. \n\nShe is a team fighting machine there is no real way around that, but if a team has good focus and knows how to save at least one form of CC then she will also be fairly weak there since she relies heavily on resets to try to do damage in teamfights.\n\nItems and abilities that counter her are pretty much anything that makes someone not die when they should. Kayle ult, Zilean Ult, GA, basically anything that stops her from getting a reset is a counter. Without resets she is a very underwhelming mid laner.\n\nIf ahead though she will blow you up before you have a very good chance to answer, but that is the nature of all mid lane burst assassins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AccountaBilabudy","date":"2014-12-19T22:52:22.638+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:31}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ch0c0lateJesus","date":"2014-12-19T23:16:22.290+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Shunpo needs to have an actual cast time. \n\nYes I know it will make it harder for Kat players to get pentas by falling alseep with their face on the keyboard, but then maybe people will stop making fun of them for playing a champ that a chimp would find too easy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zen Fury","date":"2014-12-19T23:03:01.449+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"A Kat has two options in a fight.\n\n1.

This is usually a good strategy for lower ranks where she becomes a pubstomper if you have any skill with her at all.\n\nAt higher levels, no one is going to blow their hard CC with a Kat around. They're going to wait to catch you. Since you're so squishy and don't really do a whole lot of damage without your ult, you're also hoping your team can keep the enemy team off you so you don't get caught and killed BEFORE you ult. At this level of play, Kat is more like an assassin; she's only really deadly if she sneaks up on you or if she comes in as cleanup on a fight.\n\nKat is just fine the way she is.
