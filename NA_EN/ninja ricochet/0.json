Is there a fix to this, I've tried reinstalling twice and it works at first but after patching it does the same thing. I'm on Windows 10 Home if that matters.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-03T16:51:45.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This may not necessarily an issue with game files that would require a repair, but actually a network issue failing to download assets.  I suggest going over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure your connection is configured to establish a connection and keeping it steady.  You can also use our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to automatically configure some settings, like your firewall.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Ninja Ricochet","date":"2016-09-03T17:44:26.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks so much, used the repair tool and used the change dns setting and worked like a charm.
