The temple of the moon. \r\n{{champion:41}} Yeah yeah, I don't really care. Long as I get me share of the riches.\r\n{{champion:81}} So... this is it. We're finally here. The temple of the moon. I'm getting shivers just thinking about what mystical artifacts might exist within.\r\n{{champion:254}} I'll open the temple doors.\r\n\r\n*Loud crash as the temple doors collapse, smoke slowly clears*\r\n\r\n*Inside is a large, bright orange room, filled with posters of an iron knight with a icon of the sun on his armor*\r\n\r\n{{champion:89}} Oh. Hi guys. You could have... knocked.\r\n\r\n{{champion:267}} I don't understand. This is supposed to be the ancient temple of the moon.\r\n{{champion:41}} There be no booty here! Well, the monetary kind, anyways.\r\n{{champion:89}} ...\r\n{{champion:81}} This is lame. I'm going home.\r\n\r\n*Vi, Gangplank, and Ezreal collectively grumble as they leave*\r\n\r\n{{champion:131}} Leona when are you gonna pay the re- WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DOOR.\r\n{{champion:267}} I... I thought this was supposed to be the moon temple.\r\n{{champion:131}} It is. I'm renting it out to leona... among other services.\r\n{{champion:267}} I didn't need to know that second part. B-b-but if this the temple, where's the moonstone?\r\n{{champion:131}} I dunno. Some riot employees took it last week. They're probably retconning your lore.\r\n{{champion:267}} What's a... retcon?\r\n{{champion:89}} Go ask Sivir or something.\r\n\r\n*Nami hurriedly runs off, Then hears the cuddling of Leona and Diana and decides to run even faster*\r\n\r\n*Somewhere inside a overly-air conditioned office*\r\n{{champion:111}} Morello.\r\n{{champion:34}} What is it, Ghostcrawler?\r\n{{champion:111}} She's onto us. She might be able to undo the retcon.\r\n{{champion:34}} No... Let her go, for now. I will have some fun with this one.\r\n{{champion:111}} As you desire, sir.","replies":[]}
