Just wanted to let you know that this isn't something that's intended or can be fixed right now :P Sorry about that!","replies":[{"poster":"ClickTek","date":"2016-05-13T00:58:51.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wuks,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=O9tkqjfK,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-05-12T23:28:17.039+0000)\n>\n> There&#x27;s currently an issue with the API for the Summoner Icons, so those aren&#x27;t being pushed out to websites like the Boards.

Something happened on Draven day and Riot needs to fix it.\n\nI've changed my icon several times, but it's still stuck on the cat one on the boards. Everywhere else it updates.\n\nI know this is related to Draven day. I understand it is not the most urgent issue currently, but I would like to see it fixed sometime soon if they can spare the time.","replies":[]}]}
