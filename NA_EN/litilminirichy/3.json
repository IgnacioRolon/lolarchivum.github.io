He gets a bad rap because many low elo players try to play him without possessing the requisite skill to unleash the champion's true potential. If you invest a couple hundred games into the champion and commit to reading guides and learning it, Yasuo can take you a long way.\n\nHere is Dopa's recent take on yasuo.\n\n\"Bullshit aside Yasuo is a broken champion. People say he's a high skillcap champion, but the secret with Yasuo is knowing how to control yourself while playing such a overpowered champion. Yasuo's weakness comes from the fact that he is too strong. His laning phase is so strong that after the laning phase people do not know how to keep calm and throw the game.\" - Apdo","replies":[{"poster":"Litilminirichy","date":"2016-10-02T00:40:46.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anyone besides Yasuo?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RebornnFX","date":"2016-10-01T22:52:32.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:7}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:238}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Privileged Jew","date":"2016-10-01T22:40:00.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:143}}   You have to know when to use your ultimate, how to position effectively, how to kite, how to micromanage seeds/seed ammunition during a fight, and how to land a very difficult E skillshot.\n\nThere's much more.
