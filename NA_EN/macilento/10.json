His weakness is that if he isn't doing something, he's losing. Other champs, especially mages, can make huge gains by using spells as little as possible. Yasuo has very short cooldowns on his main abilities, and no resource cost, so he doesn't stand to gain anything by not using them. So, you just need to limit how he can use them. Which is why the above person's suggested Malzahar works so well; Yasuo can't do shit to that post-6. This sort of zoning skill can help against more than just Yasuo, and it's a large portion of what Orianna and Cass can accomplish, so I'd definitely suggest practicing it. Viktor, Ziggs, and Azir are all also extremely good at zone control, so if it turns out the style suits you, you might want to consider them as well. Sorry for the long-ish post, I felt I owed you some more serious advice, given you seem to be pretty up to improving yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"Sassmast3r","date":"2015-08-04T05:46:29.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't thank you enough for the lengthy post; this really does help a lot!!
