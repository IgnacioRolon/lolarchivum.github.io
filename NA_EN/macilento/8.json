Dudes like Darius and Garen take the same (IF NOT MORE!!!) damage then a full tank Dr.Mundo while killing off a target for half of his health.\nThen why having tanks in the first place.\n\nWanna hear a fun story?\nI am heavily addicted to playing rankeds to climb up in this game, and i wanted to reach Platinum by the end of the season. I mainly play Support and Top, and guess what. I like playing anks in toplane: Sion, Tahm kench, Mundo. I couldn&#039;t be impactful as i wanted, in the end i was irrelevant by the end of the game.\nI decided i had to start picking up the Juggernauts to be succesful in that lane to have a chance, I choose Garen as a go to pick for the toplane.\nEnd of the story? 70% winrate with Garen and got my platinum promotion. Yeah cool, im very happy about that, but it&#039;s proof of what i said. \n\nTANKS ARE IRRELEVANT.\n\nFor this pre season i will say soemthing i like that is the Resolve mastery Tree, it&#039;s the only mastery tree where you actually have meaningful choices to do to be tanky as you want. But that&#039;s it it doesnt help too much with all the things i mentioned above.\n\nRiot i demand justice and an answer on this topic, since it seems like you dodge this kind of questions.","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-11-12T15:04:19.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I don't think tanks are supposed to be late game champions.

I mean, if they are known for a lackluster early game (Mundo specifically is very bad in lane pre-6, and Ramus is so bad in it he isn't even played there, same with Amumu), and if you say \"they aren't supposed to be lategame\", what does that leave you with? Being a CC bot for 15 minutes of the game?\n\nSimply put, the reason why tanks get no love is because damage is so prevalent in LoL, causing the value of CC to skyrocket, leading to less CC, leading to less tanks. They get less of EVERYTHING apart from defense because of power of their utility to let the rest of your team clean up, making playign them severely unfun as all your impact directly relies on someone else.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ale non è male","date":"2015-11-12T15:09:16.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Very Toxic Jinx,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=W3xKhiR5,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-11-12T15:04:19.768+0000)\n>\n> I don't think tanks are supposed to be late game champions. \n\nWHAT? As much as what happens with marksmen, they are entirely dependent on getting items, so FOR SURE they are supposed to be late game champs\n\nJuggernaut category is more of a try to lay down a plan for the future rework of bruisers, which Rioters have been stated to be the most difficult category to balance","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-11-12T15:14:34.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No wonder people always complain about tanks, then.

Once marksmen get damage and As, then they are supposed to have reached a first powerspike, to then round up the build and reach that final powerspike given by the fact that they are the damage dealers non gated by resources. Tanks need to scale first to just not get istantly deleted by the main source of enemy damage dealer just as if they were squishies with terribad damage, and then they are supposed to become corenerstone for the very team and very difficult to kill frontile to enhance their allies\n\nTo say that tanks aren't supposed to be late game champs is idiotic, what they are supposed to be then, idiotic no damage little less squishy champs put there just to be an higher challenge for players, givent that in no way they should be supposed to work in early to mid game?","replies":[{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2015-11-13T11:27:02.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's also a problem than games don't last long enough for full-build to happen even for marksmen.
