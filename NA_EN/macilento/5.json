High damage, high mobility players that SHOULD be very squishy as counterplay.\n\nAs a Zed main ( i am by no means good i just main him) i find that yes, thunderlords makes zed very strong but almost every champion in the game has some sort of cc to negate death mark or reduce it s damage, and WQE combos are pretty easy to dodge IF you are in position in lane. However, zed has a high skill cap and there is a potential to outplay your opponent hard. I think the problem with zed right now lies in Thunderlords and not the champion. Think back to pre thunderlords meta, zed was a weaker pick for assassins. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Envy Sin","date":"2016-01-20T23:08:03.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zed has always been a good/safe pick.
