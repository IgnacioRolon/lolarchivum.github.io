Let me bring it up real quick...steam. YES! I KNOW! Steam has alot of more to it so it doesn't have to resort to the tacticts. Multiply games, third party, summer sales etc. But your name was changeable. So again, I'm not a guy who thinks it's crap because I can buy it. I'm kinda mad that it shouldn't be something you buy...but anyway, I would like this disscussion to stop plz? There's a comment at the bottom that explains exactly why I don't want more notifications about this comment. But for those who won't bother to scroll down, I'll just copy and paste it, right now. Because I for a moment thought that this discussion was over. And I hope that I won't come back to this mistake of mine.\n\n\nOk, it seems that I pissed of plenty of people. And I understand the \"if you don't want it, don't buy it\". So simply put it as this. I don't want you guys to comment about this anymore. Don't mistake this for a \"I'm too professional for you guys, I don't wanna continue this discussion any longer! I got to bang my totally real girlfriend.\" But the reason is that, well I'm obviously a guy who likes attention and as someone like everyone else and isn't really popular, one comment means a lot to me. So when I see the notification I get a little excited that someone might have responded to a joke I made, but instead it's another one that says don't want it? Don't buy it! I get the point and to be fair, I don't see a way to make an announcer pack without charging extra. I also realize that my comment had a very negative feeling when reading it. I'm sorry. It's just that I'm ok with buyable champions and I'm ok with skins. I'm ok with wards skins, and I understand IP boosts even though I don't care about them. I was just surprised the first time to see things like name or server change cost extra while other f2p experiences provide those for free. I don't think it's worth commenting about this unless you got something different to say. It's all but a constant reminder that I wrote that comment poorly and aggressively. And I know that -16 isn't a lot, but it is for me it really does. Which is why I don't want to continue this. Not because \"abandon the ship when you realize that you lose\" but because I don't want to be reminded and I don't want it to be popped up on my notifications any more. And for those who got mad, all I can say is...\n\n**I'm Sorry**","replies":[{"poster":"ƒoes","date":"2015-09-11T21:56:02.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know, I completely understand.\nSorry if I may be continuing the conversation, but now that I've seen your comment that you posted previously, I fully understand your tone of voice.
