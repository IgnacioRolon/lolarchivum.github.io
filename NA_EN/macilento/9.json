Sorry!)\n-----------------\n**SECTION 1: What is the Noxian War Arena?**\nThe Noxian War Arena would be  a very large Coloseum-style Arena, placed somewhere in Noxus. We don&#039;t have any Noxus related game map, so this is the right concept to do it. Kinda insipired by the Gladiator Draven skin, this Arena would be the symbol of brutal strenght of Noxus, and what better place to demonstrate strenght if not a gladiator-style arena?\nBut don&#039;t think this is just mindless brawling, infact it&#039;s very strategic map as well : &gt;\nSo imagine that, but done by the good artists at Riot, with some good music behind it. And here we go!\n\n----------------\n**SECTION 2: Basic rules**\nTo know more how this whole things work you have to read this while looking at the Map i drawed up there. There are a bunch of things that i will explain later too in that map.\nAnyway, this game mode is supposed to be much shorter in game time then Summoners Rift, Probably the same time as Aram, if not little less. Let&#039;s say around 20 minutes.\nYou earn a new TEAM CURRENCY, the Noxian Mark of Strenght, With each kill and assists  you eanr with your team, These marks are used in various ways (i&#039;ll explain that later)\nYou Earn gold passively like in aram, same for the experience, you get gold from kills and assists AND DOING OTHER STUFF (we will get to it later).\nThe map is symmetrical and it&#039;s a Polygon with 10 sides as a base. Inside of it you can see there are various wall, buffs, sections and so on.\nSo don&#039;t think that this arena is small, infact it&#039;s pretty big.\nThis is regular 5 vs 5, red team vs blue team, 1 start at the top, 1 at the bottom.\nMinions will spawn from the nexus (much more minions each wave then in sumoners rift), and will battle around that Blue circle you see in the middle (will get to that later).\nNeedless to say, to win you have to destroy the enemy nexus.\nYour champions spawn where the shop is as always.\nThese are the basic rules you need to know, now let&#039;s get into the specific stuff.\n\n------------------\n**SECTION 3: Objectives, Outposts, Central Shrine**\nSo here comes the exiting stuff. EVERYTHING in this map is an Objective. Literally. I will now explain each one (Look the map while you read this):\n\n1) WALLS - Yes this are lines of stone wall. Their purpose is to divide the map in various section, provide protection and strategic plays. But guess what: THEY ARE TOTALLY DESTRUCTIBLE. Yes, true they will take A LOT of hits before going down, but either you or the enemy can destroy this walls (You can even destroy the walls on your sides of the map). SO what&#039;s going on?: My idea is that these walls should be used by the teams in the most proficent way as possible, that include destroying them. I&#039;ll make an example to get things clear:\nExample: Team1 might end up with a composition that really wants to brawl in an open space, while Team2 might end up with some tanks and some assassins, deciding it&#039;s better to defend the walls and doing ambushes and stuff from there. See how it works? and there are plenty of them.\nThese walls will be upgradable using the Marks of Noxian Strenght (i&#039;ll get to that too).\n\n2)BLUE/RED BUFFS: Our favorite buffs return in this map, they are positioned at the sides  of the arena, just outside your base: This means they will be most likely the first objective you will get. They provide the exact same buffs you have in Summoners Rift, nothing too much new, they will spawn faster tho.\n\n3) TURRETS: There are 2 turrets for each team in this map (or maybe not...? :P).\nThere is something more about this turrets tho, These will be upgradable turrets.\nHow to upgrade them? Well using the  Marks of Noxian Strenght i mentioned at the start (I will explain that in its own section later).\n\n4) OUTPOSTS: WHat are these things you see at each side of the Arena? Well i explain it right now. At the start of the game these 2 outposts are neutral camps of &quot;mercenary&quot; type of minions. That means that the first team that kill the &quot;leader&quot; of these neutral gladiators will ear their favor. These outposts are much more harder to kill then a regular blue/red buff, they will most likely need at least 2-3 people, if not all of your team (depends on what you decide to do, and how many enemies are there as well). \nSo What Happen when you conquer an outpost?: A mobile catapult will spawn here defended by the neutral gladiators of before (now they fight for you). What they will do its move the catapult SLOWLY forward towards the enemy base. \nBasically they will put pressure on the enemies. The defending team will have to deal with these mercenaries sooner or later or their base will suffer. If the opposing team defeat the outpost leader once again, they will now change their colors and fight for them, moving the catapult in the other direction and so on.\nLike the Turrets, the Catapult will be upgradable using the Marks of Noxian strenght (i&#039;ll get to that in its own section)\n\n5) CENTRAL SHRINE: What is that Blue thing in the middle? Well it&#039;s the central shrine. It will be the core of the Arena and you will want to capture it to get more power. Like the altars in Twisted Treeline  you will have to stand still in the shrine without enemies around to capture it.\nThis will be where the most brutal head on fights will take place as this is the place with the most open space in the map.\nWhat happen once you capture it? Well for 2 minutes it wont be capturabel again by the enemy team, and will spawn a fearsome beast (that will coem out from underground, like the how the Romans used the Lions and Tigers in their Coloseum shows)\nI still have to come out with a name for this beast , but i imagine it as a Lion-like huge beast (to remain in the colosium theme).\nWhat does this beast do?\nThe Beast will have an array of attack (Like the Baron in Summoners Rift) and will march forward from the center to the enemy base (Basically it will march with the minions)\nNeedless to say, it will be the defending team priority to defeat it without taking too much damage as this is the most powerful thing in the arena (But i guess if you have a Kalista in your team you will do that kinda easy :P), while the team that control the beast will have to play around it, and get the most out of it.\nAfterthe Beast is defeated it will return underground under the Central Shrine, and a new battle for the control of it will begin.\n\nThese were the objectives present on the map, btu let&#039;s move on to another important thing, the upgrades:\n\n---------------------\n\n**Section 5: Upgrades**\n\nAs i said before you will earn Marks of Noxian Strenght. Every Kill your team score it will be 1 Mark.\nAs i said before you can use these marks to upgrade these things: Walls, Turrets, Outposts\nWhile you can choose between different  upgrades for each one of them, only 1 can be active at each time. To switch to a different upgrade you will have to spend other marks.\nLet&#039;s see each one of them\n\n**1) WALLS: **Walls will have 3 Upgrades (Note that you can upgrade only the Walls that are around your Nexus, not the other that are &quot;free&quot; on the map):\n**&bull; Spiked wall: **The walls on your walls will grow spikes dealing X physical damage to any attacker. Cost 10 Marks\n\n**&bull; Double Wall: **Your Walls will get another wall in front of them, you wil have to kill this one before attacking the inner one. Overall less resistant then the inner wall. Cost 10 Marks\n\n**&bull; Magic barrier:** Every 15 seconds your wall will grow a big magic barrier around them for 3 seconds: Any allied champion inside it is immune to magic damage for that duration. Cost 10 Marks\n\n**2) TURRETS: Turrets will have 5 upgrades:**\n**&bull; Dragon Turret:** The Dragon Turret shoots fire projectiles on the ground around them not aiming at particular enemies. The targeted ground will burn for 2 seconds dealing X magic damage each second to the enemies that go over it. Cost 15 Marks\n\n**&bull; Hextech Turret:** The Hextech turret will shoot at a slower pace then normal turrets, but every 3 shoots, the next projectile will deal triple damage to whoever is hit. Cost 15 Marks\n\n**&bull; Crystal Turret: **The Crystal turret projectiles slows the enemy hits by 35% for 2 seconds. Cost 15 Marks\n\n**&bull; Archer Turret:** Your Turret won&#039;t shoot anymore, a gladiator archer will instead climb on top of it. The Archer deal less damage then a normal turret, but shoot at an increased range, and faster. Cost 15 Marks\n\n**&bull; Mecha Turret:** Mecha will charge 1 projectile every 5 seconds, without shooting.\nAt 5 stacks, they will release one single rocket projectile that deals half the CURRENT health of the target hit as true damage, to the first enemy champion in range. (This also means that it wont attack minions). Cost 15 Marks\n\n**3) OUTPOSTS :** Outposts will have 3 upgrades:\n**&bull; Piltover powered wheels:** The Catapult will move faster. Cost 10 Marks\n\n&bull;** Freljord warrior:** The Leader of the mercenary outpost will be replaced by a Frljordian Gladiator, wich has increased health and damage. Cost 10 Marks.\n\n**&bull; Noxian Weapons:** Each of the mercenary in the outpost will be using improved noxian weapons. Each hit they will make the target bleed for X physical damage in 2 seconds. Cost 10 Marks\n\nThis end up the part of the upgrades, if you have ideas or doubt tell me in the comments.\n\n_________\n\n**Section 5: EXAMPLE OF EARLY GAME GAMEPLAY**\nLet&#039;s Say Team 1: Azir, Ezreal, Lux, Corki, Cho Gath.\nTeam 2: Aatrox, Elise, Sivir, Sion, Jarvan 4\n\nGame start, and Team 1 decide to play passively, they team comp is more focused on poking out the enemies off objectives rather then direct fight, while team 2 goes aggressive from the start.\nSivir get red buff at start with the help of Aatrox, and Elise do blue buff. Team 1 Do the same, Azir gets blue, Ezreal get red.\n\nThey will start the game going all 5 in the center, aram style for the first moment, testing each other out. This would be probably won directly by Team 1, Able to poke them out in open spaces.\nSo Team 2 Decide to change strategy: Sivir Mid will keep mnions cleared and enemies in check. Aatrox, Elise, Sion and Jarvan go all 4 to right outpost. They will be faced off by 3 of the opposing team, but they will win the early fight in the narrow spaces, and wil get the Outpost, even if with low health.\n\nTeam 1 will answer somehow getting the other outpost, but Team 2 will react in time after a recall, We will have a 5 on 5 battle here but team 1 will get 3 kills off of that and will get the outpost.\nAnd for here the games start to get bloodier and bloodier:\nJust a quick example :)\n---------------------\n**Section 6: CONCLUSION**\nThis map is designed with 2 things in mind.\n1) Reward strategic play\n2) Reward individual skills and brawling\n\nI tried to put those 2 things into one, and i think it may very well work with the League of Legend style.\nEvery different champion combination brings many advantages and weknesses, and you have to be smart on how you use your upgrades.\nUsing the walls, the fog of war, the outpost and the central shrine are all equally important here.\nBut on the other side to get upgrades you have to get kills, so you ahve to fight at some point. This means that virtually any type of champion can be very useful in this map (unlike arams where the more poke is the most potent thing).\nFor Example Bard might seem useless here, but in reality you can put W around the arena, and do very  Wall long magical journeys.  :).\nAssassins here can shine when attakking from the fog of war or behind walls, Fighters will get the spotlight an open brawl and so on.\n\nNow please, it took me a while to write this all down (3 hours), so if you are interested, please give constructive criticism.\nIt would mean a lot, Thank you all.\n\n-----------------------------------\nAnswers to questions:\n- Yes, bushes are supposed to be there, i jsut didn't mention them, still i have no clear idea where to place them.\n- Only the \"free\" walls around the map are supposed to be destructible, not the one around your base.
