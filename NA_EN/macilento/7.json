Players count on them to do a job. When a skill is highly unreliable, we have to overpower it to make it 'satisfying enough'. Let me give you an example: Let's say Kayle's targeted invulnerability ult had a 95% chance of working, and a 5% chance of doing nothing when cast. We'd have to make it a LOT stronger to make it 'good enough' because you could not rely upon it... and it would be a lot less fun. Random abilities have this problem on reliability -- they tend to be a lot less satisfying, so you have to overpower them a lot more. Small amounts of randomness can add excitement and drama, but it has a lot of downsides. There are other examples of non-reliability, but randomness is the most obvious one. Abilities that require peculiar situations to do their jobs tend to run into the same problems, such as Tryndamere's shout that only slows when targets are facing away from him.\"\n\n-Zileas\n\nThis is pretty ironic honestly considering how skillshots became super common and abilities have to be unreliable to be \"counterable\", which led to yasuo/kalista's broken states.","replies":[{"poster":"Runawaydevil","date":"2016-09-19T01:05:01.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ik its a year old post but holy shit you guys are pissing me off,\n\nThere is 0.1 counterplay to annie\nthe .1 stands for when you have flash and great reflexes\n\nif im an assasin, i can't kill annie,\nif im an adc i cant kill annie,\nif im a fucking tank, i cant kill annie.\nHell if its a 3v1, guess what, i cant kill annie\n\nif she does, by the will of god, finnally die.

The problem for Annie comes if the target is long-ranged consistently (Ziggs, Xerath come to mind) she can ONLY do anything if Flash is up - but that's just an aspect of MOBAs: counter-picking, so that's not a big deal overall. The other problem, this time for the enemy, is that if they have to be close themselves to do anything to Annie (especially if they're melee) then it's very difficult for them to do anything, but again, that's just counter-picking.

The only time it resembles toxicity is when she gets monstrously fed early and can legitimately 100-0 carries, but in *most* games Annie cannot 100-0 anyone with the removal of DFG. She counters ADCs fairly well with upfront burst plus her E shield, but so what?  Most mages counter ADCs.\n\nWith her tiny tiny cast ranges, you can't even claim that her instant stun makes her especially safe, either.

Inb4 the argument is that she can stun so gap-close is ineffective, don't dash in on her while her stun is up or about to be. If Tibbers became a throw, I feel like it should be a quick throw, with reduced damage, longer range and the stun should still happen. But honestly, I don't think she needs it. Any Annie player knows they have to think about how and when to cast Tibbers, and if they make a mistake or get too close, they die before Tibbers is even cast. It's all about knowing how to play against an Annie to determine if Tibbers is strong or not. It's no different than Diana's Q+R, Akali's R, Zed's R, and Fiora's R to name a few.

Since she only gets CC if she sits on her spells, she can't use her spells to poke or farm, which means she needs to rely on her autoattack for both those things.  No other ranged AP midlaner is anywhere near as reliant on their autoattack as Annie is.\n\nI like the idea of Tibbers being thrown from a thematic perspective, but Tibbers instantly stunning the entire enemy team is the only reason Annie is even remotely viable lategame.  Without the ability to decide teamfights reliably, Annie's usefulness will succumb to her low range and lack of mobility.  If Tibbers were to become less reliable, you'd have to move that reliability into some other part of her kit and it's hard to think of a good way to do that that wouldn't delete counterplay.\n\nFor example, you could make this change to Tibbers if you allowed her passive to only proc on enemy champions, but then she'd become far too good at pushing and farming and her opponent wouldn't get to play around her moments of weakness when her passive is down.  Or I guess you could try adding some mobility onto her E (maybe a decaying spike of movespeed), but then you've just beveled away both her strengths and her weaknesses (the exact opposite of Riot's design philosophy) while also making her generally more terrifying outside of teamfights.\n\nShe's far from the only champion with instant AoE spike damage with a stun.
