Have anyone overcame this issue? I have reinstalled it 5 times, repaired it, run as administrator, and ran troubleshoot compatibility tools. No luck yet, but at this moment I'm still researching. This happened since the new client released. Any help is greatly appreciated, thanks!&lt;3\n\n\nThe program or feature '/??/C;\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\LeagueClient.exe' cannot start or run due to incompatibility with 64-bit versions of Windows. Please contact the software vendor to ask if a 64- bit Windows compatible version is available.","replies":[{"poster":"BIacksky","date":"2017-04-30T02:06:20.620+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:412}} Hey, fellow Summoners!\n\nThere's a way to solve this, the wonderful specialists helped me find the light and now I'm back on League of Legends again. \n\n\nThanks to Rufio and Broporo from Tech Team\n\n \\o/\nHere's the method.                                                                      v\n\n\n\nHey there iDakkoku, Rufio here from the Tech Team. Thanks for reaching out to us and sending out those logs!\n\nIt sounds like you've done a ton of stuff to try and fix it, whoa. I definitely appreciate you taking the initiative like that. 16-bit applications died out during the DOS days over a decade ago, so that's a bogus error message haha. With the logs you sent out though, that'll help quite a bit.\n\nI saw Avast anti-virus running in your process list. Just for now, can you uninstall it? That way, we can rule it out as causing an issue. After the investigation, you're definitely free to re-install it. Here's how to remove Avast.\n\nGoing through the older game logs on the 23 and 24th, it looked like file corruption was starting to take over. I know you've re-installed it already, but let's go all the way by nuking League completely and wiping the slate clean with a super thorough re-installation (important step bolded for ya):\n\nUninstall LoL by going to Control Panel > Programs > Uninstall a program.\n\nOnce it's uninstalled, download and run a free recommended utility program called CCleaner: https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner\n\nDelete the entire C:\\Riot Games folder.\n\nIn CCleaner, go to the Registry tab and run the Registry Cleaner to scan for any additional leftover LoL files. (I've attached a quick image for reference)\n\nClick on Fix Selected Issues, back up the changes if you'd like, and click on Fix All Selected Issues.\n\nRestart the computer to be safe.\n\nIf you don't have a copy of the installer EXE, you can download it here or head to our site and download it there.\n\nIMPORTANT: Right-click on the installer EXE and click on \"Run as administrator\".\n\nReinstall LoL (Verify that you are installing to this directory (it is the default one): C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends)\nLet me know how it goes! Send over a brand new LoL Logs.zip file if you're still having trouble. Thanks!\n\nRufio\nLeader of the Lost Boys\nRiot Games Player Support\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                      -Thanks, again!\n\n\n\n\nHere you go, guys.\nI'm so glad you guys are able to play again too. Good luck, Summoners!
