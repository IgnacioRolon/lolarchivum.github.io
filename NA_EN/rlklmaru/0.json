And yes I checked every inbox in my email including spam and there was nothing. I have submitted a ticket last night but still haven&#039;t gotten a response, but I was wondering what would likely be the reason for this?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2017-11-10T01:56:58.055+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's a protective suspension on your account. You'll have to contact player support.","replies":[{"poster":"Theorex","date":"2017-11-10T02:14:55.695+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This, This is what I like seeing you guys do.  Even though 90% of the time.  People post images of them being banned saying \"I didn't deserve this!\"  You guys still do this for the 10% of players that actually don't deserve a ban.  But I think for future reference, it should include the reason why the person was banned.  Such as Your account is getting logged in from a different location that is not within a reasonable timeframe.  Etc etc etc.","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2017-11-10T02:45:28.003+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, the issue with that is that if the account **was** hacked, you are basically giving the hacker a neat summary on where he needs to improve so this doesn't happen again.\n\nIt's a tricky subject. Personally, I believe they should send at least some information in the E-mail, even if it's just something along the lines of \"This permaban is **not** meant as a punishment, please contact support asap!\"","replies":[{"poster":"Theorex","date":"2017-11-10T06:06:32.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But heres the thing to that.  I've had my account hacked.  \n\nThey ask questions that a hacker wouldn't know.  \n\nThey may be able to figure out some of that information.  But there is no way that they would know every single detail of your account.  You leave a very long line for riot to follow.  From people you have played with.  Your champions you purchased.  What champions you purchased with what.  When you purchased older champions that don't show up in history.  You know the basic stuff.  That doesn't even get into the physical side of things.  Where they ask for general location and what not.  Etc.","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2017-11-10T06:24:41.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's just the thing though, knowing how Riot detects hacked accounts to begin with, helps hackers **avoid** this part of the system so they don't even have to answer those questions; at least not until/if the original owner notices the account was hacked.\n\nThis also makes it more difficult to prove that a certain action was taken not by the account owner but by a hacker (for example when the hacker triggers a regular toxicity ban).","replies":[{"poster":"Theorex","date":"2017-11-10T07:42:49.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean riot holds information in the logs of where people connect to their servers from.\nThis is in regards to getting banned for toxicity.    If a player is hacked, then is banned for toxicity.  Then riot has the tools to determine if the ban was because of a hacker or not.  Hackers pick the easiest route to hack.  And if there are hackers that pick the harder routes.  I can tell you they aren't aiming at random people.   Most hackers are just using basic programs.  VIA malware, trojans, worms, etc.  That is less the hacker doing anything and more of the person not taking care of their computer.  But regardless, I see where you are coming from.  If a hacker were to figure out the process that riot takes to secure the account.  Then off of that information, the hacker could try and bypass the system themselves.  But a system that can be bypassed by just knowing the process.  Probably, shouldn't be used by riot because then that is a huge security flaw.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-11-10T02:47:28.727+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with TrulyBland here - if you have varied messages (or even if you just give more info on *other* permabans), you open it up for the hacker to realize they were caught.\n\nThis same (or a very similar) message is sent for chargebacks and some manual behavioral bans - the hacker will not know why they were banned, and thus cannot avoid detection if it truly *is* a legitimate hacker and not a prohibited sharing/selling of account.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
