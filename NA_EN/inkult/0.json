This is the current state. \n\nQ- Used to be AoE damage. While not really flashy, worked, helped jungle clears and provided a decent slow for ganks. Now it is worthless in jungle, making less dmg overall considering all camps. Vs Champions, the pull is so minimal I rather keep my old one. Makes it less reliable, since you need minions or another champ to actually work. In team fights, is so clunky is very much pointless. \n\nW- Same as always. \n\nE- Somehow, the circle showing where you will land wasnt enough. Now the knock up is nerfed too.  So Nerfed to the ground again. \n\nUltimate- Woah. Now you really screwed it up. The Zac ultimate was not only used as a knock back. Could help you get in and out of fights. Maybe even survive a chase. The new one is basically useless in every aspect and weaker. You land E, have .5 secs to charge. The problem is that landing on E actually pushes people OUT of your R. So you either insta press R and make a less powerful Maokai Q or simply zone while getting destroyed, and of course, you are done, cause there is no escape after that. Maybe Riot thought about a worthless Nunu ult with no dmg?\n\nZac was a balanced, fun champion and you destroyed the whole mechanics and fun out of it. Sure, now is more &quot;INTERESTING&quot; to look at. Perhaps vs Dummies or AL. \n\nEvery single aspect of Zac got nerfed, I dont think an apologize and a revert would be too much to ask.","replies":[{"poster":"Taliyah Rocks","date":"2017-05-04T19:04:40.485+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just wish they would revert him already and admit that his rework was a failure.\n\nHE WAS FINE!\n\nHE DIDN'T NEED A REWORK!\n\nHe was fun, felt great, was balanced, did his job, his gameplay felt rewarding.

If you dislike the increased challenge and preferred the constant AoE damage then I suggest you try Amumu or Mundo instead, they're still relatively easy and provide AoE damage in teamfights.\n\n{{champion:32}} {{champion:36}}\n\nYou seem pretty set in your opinions.

He was meta, and sure he was decent, but being able to dive onto somebody from a screen away and kill them while disrupting the rest of their team wasn't exactly healthy. Nautilus deals too much damage for a tank as well and I suspect that Riot may change that about him in the future.\n\nI don't think that the changes are as bad (or unnecessary) as you think they are. They changed Zac from the unintended but successful AP Diver/Disruptor into a more defined Vanguard with more tools to better serve his intended purpose.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Anags","date":"2017-05-04T18:16:28.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His ult doesn't really give a lot of new interesting things.

He is a very powerful jungler, but his E was nerfed. The one thing they promised not to touch, was changed.  Now it gives a .5 knockup rather than 1 second.  This is huge, and could actually have made his ult much better.  I don't dislike the fact that they reworked Zac. I disliked the fact that they made it a nerf, and not a buff.  He wasn't at the level of damage where he could shred like an ADC or mid-laner, but he had the power to do quite a bit if played right.  Also; the second most unique part of zac has weakened him so much more.  His Blob drops.  His R used to be able to drop him a large amount of blobs, letting him heal upwards of 16% of his full hp. Now, with the removal of his old ult, he no longer can get the needed cooldown reduction and blobs to allow him to do as much damage and heal.  Think of it this way, his R already lost 60% of its damage. It also lost even more damage, if you include the W that he could use while in his R, and he lost a lot more HP due to the lower amount of blobs.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-05-07T18:14:04.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK I see what you mean.

It was so easy to position yourself to target enemy champions inside the lane while they were trying to farm, which is what made Zac so hard to deal with in the top lane. Now, you cant even target an enemy champion unless they are in front of the minions or there is no wave period. Now the only possibility is to max W first, which could work, but puts him within arms reach every time.\n\nRiot did to Zac what they attempted with Skarner and force him solely in the Jungle.
