Like the riven QQ thread. I'll tell you right now why champs are OP.\nBecause you can't fucking stop building your damage item to by some resistances because for whatever reason your damage is always more important. \n\"But I won't stand a chance if I build Amor and they build ad\"\nIt increases the amount of damage you can take! That DOES NOT mean you can duel them now. That means you play around that. It means call for ganks! It means sustain in lane and soak up xP.it means you have lane presence. Riven QQ thread inspired me to write this. People complain that riven is op. As a riven main I can say she is pretty strong, but 99% of the time my opponents keep building their Tiamat or Brutalizer when I already have 2 kills on them. The only thing that does is tickle me more when I go shit on you again for the third time. Then you're gonna go on board and cry to riot that riven is op. no kid. How about you start building resistances when you are behind and I guarantee you your games won't go as bad if you play around that. This isn't call of duty, kills aren't the point of the game. Be the tank your team needs (especially when behind) and play as a team and no champ will seem op to you.\nEdit:\nThis isn't a thread to focus on riven -.- it's an example.

Honestly even though I main panth I'm more inclined to just continue my build with him even when I'm behind, unlike when I get behind with Udyr jungle, then I'll skip the trinity until later and get my 2 defense items, and that's worked a few times.  Maybe it's cause pantheon is worthless without the damage, and udyr can become a stun machine for his team.\n\nLack of wards, and some bad builds aside I think the worst part of bronze is people don't know how to play the passive game when they get behind.  I had an Azir on my team yesterday he gave I swear 10 kills in lane, along with that our bot lane was feeding horribly but not as bad.  This Azir ended 3/28/14, and our bot lane came back and our adc ended positive and support ended same assists as deaths.  About 5 minutes in bot lane started arguing after giving kills I MUTED THEM AS EVERYBODY WHO READS THIS SHOULD! and continued focusing on my game. We could have won after holding off until 45 minutes, but they had 3 tanks and we didn't have enough peel or damage to get through them, the last fight under our nexus turrets we took out the carries but the tanks finished us off.  Point being if people hadn't of fed so hard, went passive, farmed under turret, their we wouldn't have had to hold off for 40 minutes to the point where their tanks became unkillable.\n\nAlso Riven is not OP during the last month in all leagues she only has a 47.64 win percent, and a 48% in bronze in the same time.  She doesn't even break the top 50 winningest champs in the last month.

She shits on melee top laners. Just like annie shits on assassins. She has that strength. Ranged top laners do well against riven if that will make you happy. Pick lissandra or gnar if you really don't know how to play against riven. Every character has its strengths. Top lane meta is what currently makes riven feel strong. Pick up tanks or ranged characters and there. That's an alternative to learning mechanics. \nAnd build, then that's your problem.
