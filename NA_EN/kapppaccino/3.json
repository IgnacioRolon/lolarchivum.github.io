Played as nunu, got first drag 6 minutes into game, got second drag the second it spawned, enemy team was in position for third, but I told my team to let them had it , to go get baron instead. Enemy realized our plan and stopped doing drag to rush baron. We got baron waaaaaay before they could get to us, and aced then had team push while I went for drag. We grouped after and won. EZ game. Just a little tip for other junglers, play mind games with objectives . By showing the enemy that I was going to get dragon every time it spawned, they believed I would do it a third time. Never expecting the sneaky baron. Huehuehue nunu es numero uno!\r\nAlso listen to shot callers. They probably know what they&#039;re talking about. Unless it&#039;s the adc then he probably just wants to play death match :P","replies":[{"poster":"WalkingInACircle","date":"2015-08-16T18:47:58.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It worked once, it must work every time!","replies":[{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2015-08-16T18:49:28.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It actually has worked like 7.

It's a trick play that works if they don't have vision of you, but I wouldn't make it a standard play.","replies":[{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2015-08-16T18:57:10.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good point.
