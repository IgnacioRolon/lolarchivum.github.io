As far as builds go for her I couldn't say for sure. Hydra + BT are usually her core items, and sometimes Rivens build Ghostblade. You can go 100% AD but I've seen a lot of players get Randuins/Banshees/GA depending on the enemy team.","replies":[{"poster":"Flaming Diva","date":"2015-02-28T01:11:07.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tsugaga,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=fzXN5Xoz,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-02-28T00:41:16.935+0000)\n>\n> I've played her a bit and have watched a lot of others play her so I know how she's supposed to be played.
