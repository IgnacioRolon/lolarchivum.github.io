I&#039;m gold 5 and get the basics of the game but I never understand what people mean when they say &quot; Diana gets a power spike at level 9&quot; and stuff like that .... why? Because they have a maxed out q? Someone care to explain?","replies":[{"poster":"BattleOxe","date":"2015-10-20T11:09:55.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, example vlad hits spike at lvl9 because his Q gets on 4 sec cooldown and gets some DMG. Or, Darius gets lvl6 spike because he unlocks ult. Or Irelia at lvl7 because at that moment her W deals 60 treu DMG per basic. OR swain and fizz at lvl6 because of ult.

And 60 true DMG is just enough to shred anyone. You don't have to wait another 2 lvls, just for another 15 true DMG. But her lvl9 is strong too. \nOn the other hand, her major power spike is Trinity Force. Usually, it's only offensive item she needs, as she uses every single little stat out of it.
