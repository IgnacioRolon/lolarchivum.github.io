As someone who plays tons of Kassadin, this is actually painful to read because of how much bull it contains. At least it's possible to counter Kassadin somewhat by positioning well and abusing his long cooldowns (I don't just play him, I've had plenty of games against Kassadins), unlike LB who will just spam Q (which has no cooldown whatsoever) and get her W off when you move too close once.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2015-10-23T04:22:37.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"He doesn't have a single ability whos base dmg is 200...","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Shroom Junkie","date":"2015-10-23T02:25:42.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kassadin has always been good.

So we can count on you to say the buffs were unnecessary and unneeded when they go live, right?","replies":[{"poster":"Shroom Junkie","date":"2015-10-23T14:04:49.211+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, I don't think he needs buffs. I think if he gets buffed at all it shouldn't be his damage or mobility but rather his defense simply because its hard to jump in, kill somebody, and jump out without being CC'd or bursted. But that's easily covered with RoA, Rylai's, and against a lot of AP, Abyssal Scepter.\n\nI think Kassadin will always stay a step below Zed because Zed has AD and can take down towers and deal more consistent damage, plus can jump out of a fight faster since his ult only takes 1 second to blink back to the shadow and his W can blink instantly. And I think Talon will always be ahead simply because he has a lot more AOE and team fight power.\nFor Kassadin to be any more than he is, yes, I agree, he'd probably be pretty OP with either crazy mobility, or crazy damage(or possibly a mix).","replies":[]},{"poster":"MCBiggah99","date":"2015-10-23T17:51:07.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kassadin main here, the buffs are not needed at all and make me terrified because I know it'll lead to him getting gutted.","replies":[{"poster":"MudintheWater","date":"2015-10-23T18:07:02.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MCBiggah99,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0ecjRh6b,comment-id=000600000002,timestamp=2015-10-23T17:51:07.641+0000)\n>\n> Kassadin main here, the buffs are not needed at all and make me terrified because I know it'll lead to him getting gutted.\n\nI really wouldn't be worried. They are relatively minor buffs that probably aren't going to make him broken. Just a little cooldown reduction and minor AP ratio increase.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2015-10-23T03:52:45.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2015-10-23T03:52:23.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not asking for nerfs I'm saying he's perfectly fine as he is now.
