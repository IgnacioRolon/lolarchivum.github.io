Imagine all the counter play! The idea came to me seeing a thresh throw lantern to river to scare the enemy bot lane away thinking it was a gank. I thought \" what if enemy jungler happened to be there when thresh decided to do that, they take the lantern and BAM counter gank . That would be hilarious. It would also force thresh players to properly place the lantern when trying to save allies.","replies":[{"poster":"DaCush","date":"2015-03-03T21:11:02.095+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think that could only be viable if Threshold were allowed to click the lantern ability again to retrieve it.","replies":[{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2015-03-03T21:14:29.487+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DaCush,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=p3m5kjqs,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-03-03T21:11:02.095+0000)\n>\n> I think that could only be viable if Threshold were allowed to click the lantern ability again to retrieve it.\n\nThere you go.
