If yes invade their blue \r\nIf not, do red\r\nGank mid blow flash\r\nBack\r\nDo blue\r\nCan you Gank top? If not do croagunk, then wolves\r\nCounter jungle \r\nGot kills??? \r\nTHIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART \r\nIf you somehow ended up 1-04,2-0-2, or anything similar\r\nCamp bot!!!! Early levels it&#039;s really important \r\nIf you can&#039;t get a kill just help them take tower\r\nThen ask top to tp for drag\r\nEveryone back\r\nThen go 4 mid! Take mid tower\r\nIf you can take another mid tower\r\nThis is the second most important part\r\nOnce you have taken down both mids and at least 1 bot tower, keep enemy jungle warded \r\nTake drags as soon as you can and have small skurmishes, never chase! You have a strong lead, why throw it??\r\nIf you keep focusing on towers it&#039;s gg\r\nTeam death match time? Expect to lose.\r\n\r\nYou don&#039;t even have to be jungle to do this. Be the shot caller! \r\nTell your jungles and top when to help you take towers and ask to group mid.  \r\nHope this helps (mostly talking to the vi who cost us game because she got a lead and thought it was team death match after that )","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-09-22T20:39:15.547+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"However, a word of caution.\n\nIf you have your entire team mid too much, you can lose towers :V\n\nKnow when to rotate, when to split-push, or when to group up. And don't stop at \"just group,\" with certain team comps you'll want to force teamfights, siege, or even tank turrets and forcefully take them if you can't push hard enough. Some champions don't excel in teamfights, and some don't excel at sieging.
