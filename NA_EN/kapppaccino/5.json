I currently dont have a computer and i see the riven skin coming back, and id LOVE to buy it, but i know i wont be able to because i dont have a computer atm. Even tho i wouldnt be able to play, id like to be able to purchase the skin for future gametime. Riven isnt the only reason, there was a few skins awhile back i desperatley wanted, but couldnt buy them because my pc had broken at the time. Is this something you guys would ever consider?","replies":[]}
