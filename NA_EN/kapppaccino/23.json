Something that emphasizes the &quot;counter jungle&quot; or &quot;objective Control&quot; part of him? Like a &quot;nunu in your jungle&quot; or &quot; nunus jungle games&quot; (shitty themes but that&#039;s besides the point) I love nunu and I wish I could buy better skins on him. Right now the sesame street one is the only good looking one. The others seem bleh.  I need more colorful nunu skins!","replies":[{"poster":"CheftoniFTW","date":"2015-09-21T19:31:20.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not Master Blaster from Beyond Thunderdome?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aeon Nightmare","date":"2015-09-21T19:25:36.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After reading your skin proposal I've decided they need a Jumanji skin, Nunu looks either like an explorer or the wildman and Willump is a silver back gorrilla :P and Nunu could be playing the board game on top of Willump's head hahaha Kinda like counter play because board games are all about winning through that haha\n\nI made a legit thread here: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/syy8yT9q-jumanji-inspired-nunu-skin\n","replies":[]}]}
