I wish I could use shadow clone jutsu and play every role myself. No but seriously I spend all of champ select giving advice to my teammates and just begging them to focus on farming and trying not to worry about kills. When the game starts I'm just panicking. I'm waiting to see the first blood, followed by double kill on our Bot lane. Or seeing mid say \" report jungler no gank\" three minutes into game cus he died. I stress a lot. But I'm learning to calm down and let the game unfold . I mute everyone. In all my time playing league, I've had ONE game where the team works with me and we communicate our way to victory,.. So I just focus on myself. Improve my scores. Help my lanes regardless of what role I play. I find this to be less stressing. I just admit when I lose and have fun improving myself.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-04-28T23:27:31.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You might be able to create a Ranked Team and enjoy that. The game is really meant to have 5 people actively communicating with each other; solo queue is just for convenience's sake. Having an organized team using VoIP gets rid of a lot of the stress you encounter in Solo Queue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Live2LetDie","date":"2015-04-28T23:25:05.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"When I jungle I go afk farm mode unless a lane is down a flash. It's not a junglers job to help you go EVEN with your lane opponent. Doing this I saw I started to compleley destroy the other jungler in items because he was doing useless ganks and wasting time. Very few games do I trust my bot or mid lane.","replies":[]}]}
