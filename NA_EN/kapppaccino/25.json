But at my elo I always seem to be able to get away with 1v2 bot lanes. I just farm under tower and poke them while they attack my tower. They can't tower dive as easy as you think. How many times have you had a leona support dive their adc after their support backed, and it results in the enemy adc getting a free kill.... Lots.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Miku Lv99","date":"2015-05-06T21:42:11.368+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they're good they can just zone you out of cs and not push the lane and you can't get any cs.","replies":[{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2015-05-06T23:38:25.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Miku Lv99,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Qa66WyfO,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-05-06T21:42:11.368+0000)\n>\n> If they're good they can just zone you out of cs and not push the lane and you can't get any cs.\n\nI should've been more clear...
