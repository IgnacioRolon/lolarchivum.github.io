NOTE though that youll be more vulnerable to their adc if they go ham on you. trade off is u have more health and lifesteal will help you more. \r\nrecently i made a rune page for caster adc: 9AD marks, 9HP seals, 5 CDR 4 MR glyphs, 2 lifesteal 1 AD quint. reason being i find casters to just do their dmg and back off. i rush vamp scept as well to make use of lifesteal. it improved my games as ez a lot. i recomend you take time to figure out you runes before you que for ranked :) it REALLY helps","replies":[{"poster":"Naixad","date":"2015-03-10T00:07:34.937+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"AGREED! Runes are meant for early game advantage when combined in accordance to the PC(Playable Character) and play style, and definitely can give one player advantage over the other. Late game I'm very unsure about the power of runes, but quints can still provide overall gameplay advantage. Even a slight different in runes amongst players can change the flow of battle (EXAMPLE: Surviving a battle, 1v1, LEVEL 1, with 50 >[OR LESS] remaining HP because of lifesteal and hp% or hp flat increase runes w/ resist or armor). Long story short: They count for something.","replies":[]},{"poster":"baby reksai","date":"2015-03-10T09:14:52.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me just say, if you don't take the correct runes into the jungle, you will get F'D HARD. Runes are super important for early game because everyone more or less is on the same playing field with no gold advantage. Having a full correct rune page vs someone without one is VERY noticeable when trading.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Chin","date":"2015-03-10T01:24:44.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's also anti-fun","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Chin","date":"2015-03-10T00:54:02.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"runes are too expensive","replies":[{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2015-03-10T01:09:16.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Axel DC,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=EcE6ef1E,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-03-10T00:54:02.688+0000)\n>\n> runes are too expensive\n\nso are champs. maybe if you mastered one champ and bought runes for him, things would be easier instead of wasting all ur lp on champs youll play once or twice and not having runes for them","replies":[]}]}]}
