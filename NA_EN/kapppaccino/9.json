If your up against a champion with any form of CC like irelia or garen or if your prone to being ganked always save your W, removes all debuffs and heals so you can escape situations when the enemy thinks they've got you locked down. \nGangplank ult can work in two ways being, win top lane by getting kills with it etc. Or use you ult to get assists(preferably more than 1 assits with your 1 ult). Then win top lane.\nLate game gangplank doesnt fall off making his E surprisingly easer to land(with me having 5 barrells instead of 2 makes a big difference)  and huge threat in teamfights. your ult can once again be use in two ways , block off other champions attempting to escape or join the fight or land a ult on the entire enemy team literally shreddin them with your team. (2 forms of AOE with your e and ult). Garen is pretty muh dominating top lane now though but a well played gangplank could beat him early.{{champion:41}} {{item:1055}} {{champion:86}}","replies":[{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2015-10-27T20:11:28.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty! I find his barrels to be pretty hard to hit pre7. But when they do hit it feels rewarding. Game play wise i think I'm doing fine. Any recommended builds?  Rushing trinity with ghost blade seems to be a stable power boost I can rely on  but there could be better optjons.","replies":[]}]}]}
