Her targetted damage is actually very important for her, it allows her to pressure an opponent without firing a skillshot, which in turn can force them to fight or flee, which makes it a lot easier to hit the skillshots. And it does do decent damage.\n\nPlus, Ahri's plenty strong. Her mediocre W is a good example of power budgeting given her very strong Q. She does not need a buff.","replies":[{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2016-01-23T04:03:16.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"her q is decent damage .-. not even on the stronger side.  and u cant control who ur w attacks in lane. half the time, at least 2 orbs hit minions. maybe she doesnt need buffs but regardless, her w does feel useless as a spell.","replies":[{"poster":"Aeolian Melodies","date":"2016-01-23T04:22:40.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ScrubcakeJungler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=IzMk56vZ,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-01-23T04:03:16.497+0000)\n>\n> her q is decent damage .-. not even on the stronger side.  and** u cant control who ur w attacks in lane**. half the time, at least 2 orbs hit minions. maybe she doesnt need buffs but regardless, her w does feel useless as a spell.\n\nPositioning does, it has a priority range like Sona's Q.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daddy Putin","date":"2016-01-23T04:07:17.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It targets champions over minions.

It is not useless and its very reliable. It gives off tons of extra damage with her ult. Its also great for kiting while running. Its lock on damage is SUPER reliable. And with Thunderlords its an instant proc. I mean have you seen ahris melt players when they get close? Its meant to give off extra damage with her ult. Also against melee champs. its an instant trade winner. \n\n Also you shouldn't be missing very many Qs its has a huge hit box and is a fast skillshot also its CD is fairly short. ","replies":[]}]}
