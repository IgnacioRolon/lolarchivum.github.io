Farming, overall, usually gives more gold than killing but killing isn't only about the gold you receive but the gold/exp the enemy DOESN'T receive while dead. \n\nDoing things with your kills doesn't mean 1v5, it means helping other lanes, making effects in teamfights, and keeping enemies down.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
