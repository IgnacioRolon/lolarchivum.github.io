My deaths was like 14 tho by the end of late game. Also a quadra kill that game  almost instantly within a second.  We won too.\n\nGenerally Kindred sucks til they get like  3 or 4 items. Preferably lots of attack speed and crit. Last whisperer is good to add in as a  2nd or  3rd item.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2015-10-20T04:24:02.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's the ult.

Is she strong early? Is she strong late? What was she meant to be?  As an adc she obviously gets the late game scaling but as a jungle she requires a bit of early power for ganks.

Bit on the broken side. Can also eat enemy's for all their health.\nHeimer is just cancer to play against \nYorick too\nKindred is a little less punishing to play against in my opinion. However these points don't make your argument invalid,  I just don't see any of those as fun for either side.","replies":[]}]}]}
