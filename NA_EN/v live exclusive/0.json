For me in the post-game chat it says I received a key fragment but when I go to the hextech crafting tab it isn't there. It doesn't happen all the time but out of the last 6 key fragments I \"received\" 3 didn't show up","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-30T22:12:07.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see that you currently have 2 hextech key fragments which were obtained today.  You already fused 3 yesterday to open a chest that yielded Lucian.  If your client is not showing as 2, try relogging as a first step.  Let me know if you're using any third party programs that interact with league as well, as it could be causing issues as a possibility.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"V Live Exclusive","date":"2016-12-30T22:43:05.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried reloading many times and I don't have a third party program that interact with league. Is it possible it might be a bug at the post-game screen where it randomly says you received a key fragment when you really haven't?","replies":[]}]}]}
