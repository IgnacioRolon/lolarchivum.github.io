I explained what happened and gave them proof that account was my brothers one\r\n( Next day someone played Draven on his account ) , he doesnt even have Draven .-.\r\n\r\nSo my question is, Would Riot be able to help me get his account back?","replies":[{"poster":"Packun Flower","date":"2016-12-26T11:08:01.566+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Possibly, he'd have to send in a support ticket and work with the account specialist to get his account back. However in the end your brother is ultimately responsible for his account. He really should have known better then to trust a complete stranger with his account information. This might be a harsh lesson he needs.\n\nRegardless, tell him to send in a support ticket and be prepared to answer some security questions that the account specialist will ask him. If he can;t answer the questions well enough then there will be no hope for his account and he;ll have to start over.\n\nGood luck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Myrmiron","date":"2016-12-26T12:48:35.823+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gonna be hard if they also changed his e-mail.\nOpen a ticket and hope for the best.\nAlso, LOL?
