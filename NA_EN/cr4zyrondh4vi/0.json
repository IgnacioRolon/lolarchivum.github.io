You'll need above average team work in such case.  but this applies to every super fed champion, not just a Yi problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShishouMatt","date":"2017-12-15T03:02:42.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is really weak early game so hinder his farming/hunt him down.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gives No Lux","date":"2017-12-15T02:48:03.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exhaust.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2017-12-15T02:43:59.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey I'm a Master Yi main (or used to be) and wrote a really long post about this a while ago: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/3AX4Jd0o-a-comprehensive-guide-to-countering-master-yi\n\nThe tl;dr is that Master Yi has some really weak macro gameplay.

Control him via stuns and then blow him out as a group. Yi cannot initiate as long as he isn't hyper fed and you have a nice group together. Doing so would be suicide for him. He wants to pick one off and blow them out. \n\n2.) Stay. Together. Always. Together. Never. Seperate. F#$@($ Group. Yi is extremely bad at initiating into large groups of enemies. So being close means he can't really kill you. \n\n3.) Buy armor. {{item:3075}} or {{item:3143}} are especially good at stopping Yi.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LUXANNA HOSHIDO","date":"2017-12-15T00:45:06.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even with his ult up, Yi isn't really that threatening when it comes to ganks. Simply warding further out will help you prepare for him since he doesn't have any CC to assist with ganks. \n\nCounterganking is also good against him because as I've said already he doesn't really bring much to a small fight that would occur in lane.\n\n\nJust don't let him catch you off-guard early game and you'll be fine. Also, watch how your enemy behaves in lane because he relies on his team to set up his ganks unless you over-extend.\n\n\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-12-15T00:43:15.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait until after he Qs to CC, so many bad players panic and fire their abilities at him while he is untargetable.
