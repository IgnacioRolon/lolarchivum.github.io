Everything beyond that is pretty situational depending on how my AP farm is doing, though I usually end up getting Merc treds over sorc shoes. I may also invest more in CDR to help me spell sling, which facilitates his passive AP gen. Maybe a Void staff if the enemy tanks are particularly problematic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Funkin Dunkin","date":"2017-05-15T19:23:42.098+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play Veigar much differently than most people do. I do however have a ton of success with it too. Veigar is a glass cannon. BUT!! He can also be unexpectedly resilient. It's very easy to get 1K+ AP on him, and personally I feel like anything on top of that is something of a waste if you're not building him for survivability. That's why I prefer making him AP/HP based. That way even if he gets in a bad situation you still have enough life to force out a quick nuclear launch. So this is what I look like when making Veigar.\n\n{{item:3027}} HP/AP\n{{item:3285}} Movement/Burst\n{{item:3089}} Duh\n{{item:3151}} AP/HP/Pen\n{{item:3001}} HP/MR/cooldown/10% more damage!!!\n\nLike I said, very different, but this is what I prefer. Will this work for everyone? No. Will I change it based on different games?  Yea. If they are full of AD I might go Tabi and Zhonas.

As most enemy teams will stack armor instead. Also i know Sorc shoes is a standard pen item for most mages but if you use swifty shoes your movement speed is a bit better since you have ludens as well. Thats just my opinion since veig is slow as all shit and swiftys help kiting once your waiting on some of your cooldowns or trying to escape.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TSP ECLIPSE","date":"2017-05-15T19:56:11.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly I play him totally different than others:\n\nRunes:\n15% CDR\n7.8 Magic Pen\n6.7 Magic Resist\n\nMasteries:\n12-18-0\nKeystone Stormraiders\n\nSummoners:\nFlash\nBarrier\n\nBuild:\nRush Tear > Rabadons > Sorc Shoes > Archangels > Void Staff > Lich Bane > (Either Hextech Gunblade or Nashoors Tooth) Depending on Playstyle lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sasogwa","date":"2017-05-15T19:45:57.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't like ROA on Veigar.

It allows to basically Gunblade + R and instaburst a squishy without anything else and no counterplay; which is pretty nice because those squishies won't take much longer to kill you themselves.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-05-15T19:19:34.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RoA is good for when you are learning him because the health gives you room for error, but later when you are better with him you shouldn't need it and you can drop it from your build so that you can get your threatening items earlier.\n\nI loosely follow Morellonomicon -> Sorc Shoes -> Deathcap as a core, after that is situational items.\n\nIf I am just wrecking them and have a massive lead I like to get Needlessly Large Rod first B into Lost Pages. This is very aggressive though and not the safest thing you can do.\n\nIf multiple enemies and specifically your prime targets are building mres go for the Void Staff next, if you are getting bursted down by magic damage then go for Banshees. If you are getting hit by things you can Zhonya's out of (Like a Syndra Ult) or if they have a physical damage threat that is bursting you down like a Lee Sin or a Zed then grab a Zhonya's Hourglass. If you are having none of those problems and are consistently bursting your targets down then get a tank item, I like to get Randuin's Omen on him.\n\nThere are other good items on him too, but those are what I would stick to until you are ready to experiment.","replies":[{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-05-15T19:35:28.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No one says Lichbane here.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-05-15T19:39:41.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not my favorite item on Veig but you can make it work. The problem is that with Veigar you are essentially trying to catch them with their pants around their ankles and unload all of your spells, meaning you don't have as much time for Lich Bane procs.
