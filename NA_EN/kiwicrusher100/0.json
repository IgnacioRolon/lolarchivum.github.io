I pressed ok and attempted to reconnect to the game several times but I would keep getting the same message over and over again. I then resorted to google and searched this issue and eventually, I came to the conclusion that it was something that had to do with the game.cfg files in the Config folder of the Riot Games folder. I deleted them and it solved the problem but my account still has 20 minute queue ban timers because of AFK warnings. I have received 20 minute timers before and have actually waited them, but this is outrageous, honestly cannot believe my experience of the game is being affected by some corrupt files on my computer and/or some bug that may or may not have occurred. I would like for this to be somehow resolved and would very much appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-19T17:43:02.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's really important to stick to custom games while troubleshooting so you don't get impacted by [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ).
