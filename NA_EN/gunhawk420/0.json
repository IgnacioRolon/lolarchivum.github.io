Then out of nowhere my client just stops opening, I check task manager and it says that it is open but the app is not there. I tried re-downloading it several times but it never works. I even tried the hextech repair tool but it didn't help at all. Can someone help explain what is going on exactly?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-29T16:35:17.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some OS update or change in security settings might be preventing your patcher or client from launching.

More specifically, your network might be having trouble reaching the game server so the loading screen might not show or comes up as a black screen.  Try the steps in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot this.
