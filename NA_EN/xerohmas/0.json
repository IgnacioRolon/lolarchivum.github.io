Anyway when I entered a game for the first time on the monitor today my game was too large for my monitor. So much so that I couldn't press anything in the menu to adjust resolution. Am I missing something in terms of hot keys or anything in the menu? I am unaware of a way to manually change game files the way a PC can.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-04T23:05:22.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, your resolution might be way too big here.  4K and resolutions exceeding 1920x1080 can visual and size issues in-game.  Changing game files wouldn't really have an impact.  Your best bet would be to reduce your scaling on the game and monitor to fix this up.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
