More if anything, because while they have 5 potential feeders, your team only has 4 (assuming you're not one yourself).","replies":[{"poster":"E GIRL SNIPER","date":"2017-01-26T01:51:12.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In theory yes, in reality no. There are a lot of times just due to sheer luck you will get several unwinnable games in a row and you might not get a balancing chain of free wins for months just due to random luck.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-01-26T07:47:03.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not not really how it happens, just how it may feel. Teammate skills are dice that are actually loaded in your favor, but because of our biases the times they work against us will leave a stronger mark than the times they were working in our favor. Also we tend to blame others before blaming ourselves. If you had several bad games in a row it more likely because of your own skills than because of teammates. Remember that the enemy has to deal with bad teammates just as often as you do, it makes no sense to think you in particular happen to be cursed with bad luck.","replies":[{"poster":"E GIRL SNIPER","date":"2017-01-27T06:02:53.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you lose 3 games in a row because bot goes 0/20 every game, its bad luck.
