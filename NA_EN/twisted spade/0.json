{"poster":"Twisted Spade","date":"2017-04-26T22:09:27.626+0000","title":"Forced \"I understand\" why I've been punished button?","subforum":"Report a Bug","up_votes":1,"down_votes":9,"body":"Alright so heres the bug:\r\n\r\nYou guys programed in a &quot;I understand&quot; why I&#039;ve been punished button last year, it pops up whenever you get a chat restriction and shows you what you said in a past game and then asks you to read it then click &quot;I understand&quot; once you understand why you&#039;ve been punished.\r\n\r\nHowever if you don&#039;t understand why you&#039;ve been punished, there is no way to gain that understanding since your help desk refuse&#039;s to speak on it or even address anything. In fact, when I told your help desk that I was NOT a reformed player and would be doing EXACTLY the same thing as I did before, this didn&#039;t seem to bother them at all, they closed my help request and told me to lie, click I understand after being clear with them that I didn&#039;t and just go continue to be another toxic part of the community.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve now spent 3 months trying to get them to address this, this is game braking for me since if I don&#039;t click the I understand then I can&#039;t use my account... So instead of being a liar, I just don&#039;t use that account anymore... and I&#039;ve been using my alt silver account instead.. And been banning my teams champs in champ selection, going things like adc annie or support veigar and steal all my adcs cs, I&#039;ll &quot;secure&quot; every kill to the point my team crys ks, I&#039;ll move out of the way and leave my team to die. Whatever toxic ACTIONS I can think of, that might be fun, I&#039;ll go for it, but the rule is SAY NOTHING IN GAME, since as long as I say nothing, then I won&#039;t be reported since the only thing riot staff seems to care about punishing is people who use team communication to speak out verse griefing or trolling actions, they don&#039;t seem to actually care about the griefing or trolling actions if those players don&#039;t say anything in chat. I can prove this by the fact I have 2 months of gameplay on my alt account and haven&#039;t receved a single warning or ban despite way too many toxic games, 100% caused by me, but cuz I don&#039;t say anything, I can actually report the other people in the game who are speaking out verse me and THEY will get punished, you even send me a handy message telling me whenever someone gets punished cuz they spoke up about me griefing, so I report everyone, every game to see how many reports you&#039;ll punish people for even tho they shouldn&#039;t be in my opinion since they have a legitimate reason to be using team communication to try and stop me from griefing or trolling.. I mean if you guys don&#039;t see this as a problem, then its not a problem, its just ... alternative off meta gameplay? Yeah I like the sound of that way better. Sightstone? Nah bro alternative off meta gameplay, I don&#039;t need that item.... And thats totally legit to you guys lol, but punish that mofo who dares tell him to get a sightstone or do his job properly as a support? Its funny cuz I actually get to see you guys punish them, again you send me a message every time some poor smuck gets punished, its commonplace for you to do this to people, punish them for speaking out verse someone who is griefing or trolling. \r\n\r\nSo since I&#039;ve proven to you the system doesn&#039;t work with this experiment (since I&#039;m able to do griefing/trolling actions and get others reported for speaking out verse me and not get punished myself due to not saying anything) then I gota ask you guys to look more deeply into your punishment system instead of blanket banning everyone in the game for speaking out verse a griefing or trolling player, you might want to start focusing on the core issues that actually cause these people to attempt team communication in the first place.\r\n\r\nSeems like a pretty massive bug in your system since your staff is willfully sending toxic players back into the system and is also totally 100% okay with them playing toxic or trolling as if its &quot;alternative off meta gameplay&quot; that is totally fine as long as they don&#039;t say anything about it. Thats quite the stance, that you can only be griefing or trolling or toxic if your typing, that actions in game cannot be toxic, griefing or trolling unless they are also put alongside in game chat.\r\n\r\nAgain this system isn&#039;t working and the help desk has zero interest on talking about this or fixing this issue or even addressing it as the reality it is. So I&#039;m requesting someone else from another department to look at this since in 5+ years across dozens of help requests I have got nowhere to the point where they just repeatedly close my requests now and straight up denie me help requests and feedback, the feedback emails I get after dealing with their help desks all denie me the ability to put anything in and submit it cuz they know it would be a negative report so I&#039;m not given the ability to give it due to that. The fact I have two different storys from the staff too also is concerning, I have people like skeletor telling me that they are all part of a group and have no manager, they are all equals, while I have people like princess bubblegum telling me of course they have a manager but they are refusing to connect me to him, but also tell me they don&#039;t have the power to comment on anything I have to say or do anything about it while some of them even agree with me, they can&#039;t do anything about it, but also refuse to connect me to a manager or someone higher up who could do something about it. I&#039;ve been running in circles for the past 3 months replying to them as often as they will to me, before that, I spent 5+ years bring&#039;n this up once or twice a year, then giving up when I was met with this much unwillingness to address any of the concerns or comflicts I could see. All my friends who have tired to point this out to them have also been met with the same &quot;go away&quot; stance they are giving me, so they left your game and all play dota2, all my first year to 3d year friends all play dota2 and video games, just not league anymore due to the help desk refusing to address any concerns, it left them with a feeling of your company not caring about them and the reality that your company doesn&#039;t care about fixing their punishment system, so no reform can ever be made, things will never become better continuing to let them create and maintain a toxic community by repeatedly releasing nonreformed players back into the player pool and refusing to address any of the issues that could turn a player into a reformed player. Should that not be the goal of the help desk? To convert toxic players to reformed players? Instead of repeatedly closing requests and proving to someone you don&#039;t care about them as a customer till they are converted from a daily player into someone actively seeking new ways to grief and troll in game without being punished? I&#039;m not even speaking from just a &quot;me&quot; point of view, this is everyone I know  from season one, we ALL have had this exact same experience with your help desk ignoring the concerns and conflicts with your system that we bring up, in favour of telling us to stop messaging them, close our help requests and tell us to go back into the community when we&#039;re being clear we are not reformed players and are asking them to address the conflicts and concerns we have that could turn us into reformed players.. but they refuse to do it and instead repeatedly close your help requests to the point where its clear we&#039;ve unwanted customers, so we move onto other games... or get mad and troll the fuck outa your game.. and your okay with eather of these? I&#039;m not honestly, I think this is a serious issue that is not being addressed that the help desk  is actually creating more of a toxic community then they are preventing with this type of actions and refusal to progress to connect to a manager who could get progress.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-04-26T22:16:28.700+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"TL;DR, lots of arrogant QQ.

Post your chat logs in Player Behavior & Moderation to gain an understanding why you received a chat restriction.\n\n2. Contact Player Support without the huge wall of text like you posted here. Keep it short and sweet, stick to your points, and don't go overboard.\n\n3. If by now you still do not have the understanding you desire, take some time away to re-evaluate your perspective.\n\nI will tell you now, participating in the types of negative behavior you described you're doing on your other account is not something I'd recommend.
