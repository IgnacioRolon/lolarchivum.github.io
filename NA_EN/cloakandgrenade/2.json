Her charm allows her to get off everything in her kit once it lands. You'd have to be blind to miss the follow-up. \r\n\r\n{{champion:7}}  Another pro-play balance nightmare with a stun with the world's most inconsistent proc range. The stun guarantees the full combo and chunks for half your HP when it procs to begin with.\r\n\r\n{{champion:555}} Someone asked the question, \"What if thresh and zed had a baby?\" and this monstrosity is the result. A balance nightmare from day one of release and still gets a bi-weekly thread complaining about him to this day.\r\n\r\n{{champion:60}}  Not so much an issue anymore but when she was an issue the biggest complaint high-elo players had about her revolved around her unusual gank paths and, you guessed it, her stun.\r\n\r\n{{champion:142}} Do I even need to explain this one?\r\n\r\n{{champion:246}} Then you have this. Someone decided that giving an assassin not just a stun, but an AoE stun that doesn't even have to hit you but a wall behind you. This is probably the most disgusting thing I've seen added to league in a while and 'overloaded' doesn't even scratch the surface.\r\n \r\nAll of these have CC that lasts long enough to make Morgana blush and they shouldn't. It just turns them into balance nightmares. There's a reason {{champion:238}} , {{champion:91}} , and {{champion:121}}  haven't had nearly the issues these others have had. Sure they've had their spot in the limelight but they were much easier to balance and bring in line because of their mechanics. They don't get an auto-win stun. Especially in a meta where even tanks are getting nuked in seconds by these assassins, they should not have hard CC.\r\n\r\nGive them a slow. Give them a silence. GIve them mobility. Don't get them stuns or roots.","replies":[{"poster":"Rewt","date":"2019-08-26T05:19:57.671+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"i mean..... i dont know how long you have been playing this game but kha was a nightmare for 3 seasons straight.\n\nHe went from a powerful assassin who if you didnt ward up everything was gonna kill your adc instantly. To a fucking Tank. Yes you heard me. a Tank. Who could 1 shot your adc. Back to an assassin who could 1 shot your adc. then into a machine gun Q Tank.\n\nYea he has had an interesting life.\n\nhis Q before his rework could do 1,400 to an iso target","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zlera","date":"2019-08-26T07:28:44.080+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree. Assassins shouldnt have *hard* cc, a slow... maybe... silence... maybe... Stun... absolutely not. Assassins deal 235% of your health as damage, if you get stunned while they do so, theres no counterplay, however, CC like Leblans E is okay in my opinion, you have to sit in her chain for a good second or two, same with Nocturne, you have to sit for 2 seconds for his 1.75 second fear. If the stun or root or fear has a tether or takes time to hit, im alright with it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2019-08-26T06:00:36.585+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ahri has always been in that middle ground between assassin and mage. She's both, and has always been both. Officially I believe she's classified as a \"kite mage\", the only remaining member of that class after LB was semi-reverted. As almost all mages (if not all mages) have hard CC, it'd be **very** strange for her to not have CC.\n\nZoe is a mage. She's not an assassin at all. She's a fucking artillery mage, which is nowhere near what an assassin is. She might have \"mobility\" on her R, but it's far from true mobility because she can't use it to actually get away, and the movement speed on her W hardly makes her an assassin either.\n\nAnd Pyke was designed as a support. There's no viable support without some kind of hard CC.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BigBellBrute","date":"2019-08-26T07:40:42.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah.
