OH REALLY.\nYeah, it's not like we have champs whose entire kits are centric around the concept of being low on HP. {{champion:266}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:154}} \nNo HP Sustain/damage from being low on HP/resurrection champs in the game. None at all. And there are also no healers that could heal a 19.9% target up to where it could survive.\n{{champion:16}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:350}} \nNot a single one.\n\nLike, yay, you finally (after an entire season of it being overpowered) nerfed the true damage off conqueror (though you made it viable on ranged champs and upped its healing making it just as strong before, just not as auto-win versus tanks), only to add so much more lethality to the game as well as a %HP execute so that tanks are in an even worse spot then they were before.\n\nJungle XP has been reworked again to make ganking punishing and drags are more important than ever, so damage focused junglers will reign supreme. Why would you ever play Sej when she can't contest early drakes and her early ganks are very hit or miss? So what if you burn a flash, you're now a level and a half behind and being behind as a tank means you die a fraction of a second slower than your AD carry. \n\nNeat, Mountain drakes grant bonus resistances.  Too bad the added damage creep in the game means that even a four stacked mountain drake tank champ is going to be melted within three or four seconds. You don't get to be tanky.\n\nI know, Riot, that high damage is better for pro play. When everyone pops like a balloon upon impact it makes the splashy bright colors that make the big brains buy tickets to your eSport. It just also happens to make for some of the most strategically bankrupt, macro inept, and unsatisfying gameplay to have ever hit the rift since AP Master Yi was allowed to be a thing.\n\nI won't stand for this for another season. I can't. I'm a support main first, and a tank main second. You guys have spent every single individual patch since early season 7 removing supports and tanks from the game. Damage and mobility keep going higher, and higher, and higher, and higher. Utility and defense keep going lower, and lower, and lower, and lower. It isn't a coincidence that two of the newest \"supports\" are carries (Pyke, Senna) and the one \"support\" that has also been successful is because of the damage they grant their carry while they remain untargetable.  Ivern's been removed from the game. Healers are practically useless. Tanks end up being squishier than Bruisers, fighters, and even some assassins with a sustain item and Conq, no more. Traditional supports get nerfed out of oblivion for defense and utility and get their damage buffed up so high it's actually braindead (tahm kench) or just quietly get nerfed out of playability (Karma).\n\nLike, neat, I'm so glad you now have AD support items. Pyke really needed the buff, thanks.\n\nLook, I'm not advocating for the tank meta to come back. But if we could make playstyles that aren't locking in a mobile carry and building full damage viable again I'd be happy. But if this damage keeps up, I'm not going to play.\n\nI won't be able to bring myself to do so. I finally climbed to plat last season. Yet despite climbing higher than I ever have, I have never felt like I had less control over my elo during a season than that one. I don't play fighters, carry's, juggernauts, or assassins. I don't play hyper-carry mages. I don't want to, it's not what I find enjoyable. But every year that goes by where this mess isn't addressed I feel like I'm punished for the supportive playstyle. \n\nI'm punished for focusing on team-wide macro play.\nI'm punished for playing a CC or utility-focused champ.\nI'm punished for itemizing for my allies rather than myself.\nI'm punished for building defensive when behind and not feeding, rather than continuing to build damage.\n\nSo let's fix it this preseason shall we?","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2019-11-25T06:30:14.699+0000","up_votes":89,"down_votes":11,"body":"If you aren't speaking some form of Chinese Riot won't hear you. :^)","replies":[{"poster":"Sewer Side","date":"2019-11-25T07:39:26.448+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":87,"body":"This is a bad take","replies":[{"poster":"LanceTheMighty","date":"2019-11-25T09:37:51.833+0000","up_votes":53,"down_votes":5,"body":"true take*","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"boricCentaur1","date":"2019-11-25T21:42:44.306+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":15,"body":"When you don't have a clue about demographics, but you still make a point like that.

Lets break down Shyvana+dragons+ocean soul\n\nShyvana gets Armor and MR scaling with each dragon she takes. I can't remember the exact numbers but if you got all the dragon souls I'm pretty sure thats in the realm of 30-40 extra armor/mr. Remember, Armor and MR work best up til 100 then it quickly becomes less and less useful to stack it. So having no tank items (minus the MR from wits end) you are probably sitting at nearly 100 armor and MR from dragons and levels alone (and a little over 100 MR from the wits end, probably around 120-130)\n\nNow, the ocean soul grants you %missing health regen per 5, the more health you are missing the more this is buffed up. Because you have so much MR and Armor from having taken so many dragons, you are mitigating around 60% of damage being done to you, and you are getting a healing steroid from the ocean soul.

Lets break down Shyvana+dragons+ocean soul\n> \n> Shyvana gets Armor and MR scaling with each dragon she takes. I can't remember the exact numbers but if you got all the dragon souls I'm pretty sure thats in the realm of 30-40 extra armor/mr. Remember, Armor and MR work best up til 100 then it quickly becomes less and less useful to stack it. So having no tank items (minus the MR from wits end) you are probably sitting at nearly 100 armor and MR from dragons and levels alone (and a little over 100 MR from the wits end, probably around 120-130)\n \nShe has 5 base bonus from her passive and gets an additional 5 per dragon, so i was at 25 but close enough.\n\nAnd armor&amp;Mr works the best relative to enemy penetration, if they have some then you´ll want more than 100 resistance to ensure you really get any effective durability. \n\nBut at this point i hadnt bought any and i think i had about 80, due to no mountains. \n\n> Now, the ocean soul grants you %missing health regen per 5, the more health you are missing the more this is buffed up.

Also you fail to mention how -LONG- you took to take 4500 dmg, which my guess is around 3-5 seconds, maybe upwards of 10 if people were missing skill shots. \n\nNah it was indeed much longer than that as the fight went back and forth but i´ve had similar ones with Sejuani where i more or less did the same thing but relied on backing out to heal with warmogs armor when i got low before going back in . \n\n> Now lets add some actual tank items, now your MR and Armor are nearer or over 200, except because of how armor and MR work, you're mitigating about 65-69% of damage being done, which means that yes you might have taken more damage over that same amount of time, but that's only because you had that health pool to take that much more damage, it wouldn't have actually added much more time to how long you were alive.\n\nDidnt have anything like that at the time, literally only had trinity force+wits end+merc boots for health and resistance, my max hp was 2200 or very close to that. \n\n\n> As someone that has played quite a few tanks and juggernauts over several years, I can say now adays that you don't really 'feel like a tank' at any point if you are equal or behind your enemies.

Similarly such a huge difference was felt as a toplaner having 2 mountain drakes.\n\n\nHitting 160 something armor with just a Randuin´s omen at 3-4 items is nuts if you ask me, enemy Cait hated me like hell since i kept walking up to her while ignoring all her damage and just killing her.","replies":[{"poster":"GigglesO","date":"2019-11-25T23:28:27.146+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Use that argument on a full tank build tank champion... \n\n>\"Tanks end up being squishier than Bruisers, fighters, and even some assassins with a sustain item and Conq, no more\"\n\nYea shyv isn't a tank.
