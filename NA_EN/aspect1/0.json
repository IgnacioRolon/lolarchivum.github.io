There are instances where alpha strike is cancelled by fog of war even though the cast time completed, which results in another bug where you keep the alpha strike buff icon in your buff bar and are unable to meditate for ~4 seconds until it disappears since alpha strike bugged out. Also, dragon resets, gaining hp and its knockback a lot of the time when you alpha strike. \n\nThese bugs are hard to reproduce except that last one, but that's no excuse to not investigate it when all these bugs have been around since early season 5.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigglesO","date":"2016-03-23T19:17:21.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Exgeniar,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=kOi1isEt,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-03-23T18:36:30.239+0000)\n>\n> Fun Fact: Annie ult selects target on cast, not after cast.
