Instant feedback hits two player behavior design values, both punishing negative players and helping them reform their behavior.","url":"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/instant-feedback-powers","image":"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_medium/public/upload/kayle_0_base_1920_2.jpg?itok=Yw1xRNeH"},"up_votes":2,"down_votes":15,"body":"So under chat and ranked restrictions\r\n\r\n\"Instant feedback began with two-week and permanent bans because the negative behaviors spurring them (**homophobia**, racism, sexism, death threats, and excessive verbal abuse) are both overwhelmingly rejected by the community and hard to mistake. After crunching several million games worth of data over the last few months, the instant feedback system’s now ready to help reform more mild, but persistent negative behaviors with chat and ranked restrictions. Beyond the extra horsepower, we’re re-tuning restrictions to better encourage reform. Learn more about that effort over on boards.\"\r\n\r\nThe racism, death threats, are both that I clearly understand and know what not to say in those categories but homophobia? Seriously RIOT? You're going to cater to something that you can't even detect if someone is scared of homosexuals in game? When someone calls another player a gay or fajjot (yes I spelled it wrong on purpose), we're not crying in fear that they might be homosexual. It's a way to be mad at a player for feeding on purpose or something. Another question is why are you not defending religions? That should be more important than protecting homophobia. I'm pretty sure millions of players have used Jesus F*** Christ in anger or in some sort of way that's not meant to be said in game. So RIOT why is that?","replies":[{"poster":"Helmight","date":"2015-09-16T18:48:12.221+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"You're right, there isn't freedom of speech here.

It's potentially very offensive to people of that particular persuasion and paints a picture of severe ignorance of the person saying it.\n\n>Another question is why are you not defending religions? That should be more important than protecting homophobia. I'm pretty sure millions of players have used Jesus F* Christ in anger or in some sort of way that's not meant to be said in game.\n\nThere's a *huge* difference between saying \"Oh jesus christ I just got destroyed\" and \"you are such a gay\".  The key is that one's an exclamation and the other is an insult, with the insult being much more potentially negative to other players.","replies":[{"poster":"Zert","date":"2015-09-16T19:00:54.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"No it's blasphemy if you use the Lord's name in vain.

It does not mean that the community has to adhere to  the structure of those beliefs. If you place freedom of religion before homophobia, you are prioritizing human rights which is unethical, impractical and unenforceable. \nEven in the US constitution Freedom of religion is considered equivalent to free speech. It is protected under a separate article in the bill of rights , but it is not included as part of  the definition free speech. Homosexuality is protected by BOTH these clauses if the perpetrator believes in a divine being that permits homosexuality and as sexuality is considered expression. So, the basis for which your understanding of law has been experienced proves you incorrect(unless you are canadian).\n\nSecondly  League of legends is a global game with servers all of over the world. Each culture has it's own taboos and opinions. It would be unfair for different rules to apply for different servers. And we cannot select the most conservative rules of each society and expect people to want to play. So on a global platform you are wrong as well.\n\nFinally swearing in chat should not be a bannable offense. You can turn the filter on and off for a reason. A bannable offense is swearing at somebody. Or calling them names. Or in other words being toxic. It is not toxic to say F**k, we didn't ward dragon. It's toxic to say \"f**k you\" you didn't ward dragon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"nerak23","date":"2015-09-16T20:49:08.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"FREYA OD ?  were you reading the same thing as me:\n\nThey never said that giving constructive advice was considered toxic !!  They never said you'd get in trouble for trying to give advice..they explained why someone might get upset by hearing what some people Think is advice..Here is the quote ! \n\n> Riot NeuroCat (NA)  - a day ago 2 of 18 Rioter Comments\nOne thing to keep in mind - when you're talking with strangers over the internet, they don't necessarily have the same context you do. What you see as 'constructive advice' may come across to others as mean or insulting. Next time in game before you give someone feedback, take a second and put yourself in their shoes. How would you feel if you weren't doing well and heard this from a teammate? Properly framing feedback is a pretty useful skill not just in League, but in life.\n\nEDT: I should have quoted you as it seems you edited your statement once I corrected you !!","replies":[]},{"poster":"freya od","date":"2015-09-16T20:23:44.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm all for banning people who are like \"hey go fuck yourself you %%%%\" or whatever while you're playing in game, but even on the post yesterday the rioter said that even constructive advice towards players can be taken as toxic because \"it might hurt their feelings\"\n\nI think _this_ is going entirely overboard. It's one thing to be toxic and drive your teammates crazy, but riot is trying to enforce everyone to fuck eachother up the ass into a giant orgy of rainbows and sunshines that only consists of worshipping words or no words at all.\n\nThat's what I think is wrong, anything to anyone could be considered toxic if they want to go down that route, and I think that just isn't fair. I'm seriously unbinding chat from here on out and never talking to anyone ever again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cowgirl Ed","date":"2015-09-16T19:12:47.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"i'd make a short post about %%%gots and other offensive things but then i'd fear to get banned from boards so i wont","replies":[]}]}
