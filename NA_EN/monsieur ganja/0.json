Sure you can just attack once and head to lane so that you won't steal the camp but at that stage you're giving your jungler a really shit leash. If they did this change you'd be able to give your jungler several AAs on the creep, which is a flat improvement.\n\nIf your mastery of the champion allows you to give a leash of equivalent value to what would be given with changes of the nature suggested in the OP then you could say \"This is unnecessary, just learn the champion more\". But it's not the case - the knowledge of how Twitch's poisons work doesn't allow you to play around it while giving a good leash, it just necessitates giving a really bad leash. And that's not fun for the jungler.","replies":[{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-06-06T02:18:06.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All you need to do is 1 hit it anyway, your support should be there leashing as well.

Your whole point seems to be \"Well it won't be a complete failure if you do this\" and while that is very much correct, I'm not sure even you know why you're arguing the point anymore. You can avoid this stuff happening by being more careful but it'd still be a flat improvement to your leashing as people like Twitch if you didn't *have* to be prohibitively careful and there's no real prospect of it removing the skill of leashing with a DOT champion either. I can't see why \"it's fine as it is\" is a reason to argue against the OP. \n\nSure it's fine if you leash in the correct way.
