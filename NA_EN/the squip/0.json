Check for that in the client options, and let me know if that's not the case and we can dig a little further.","replies":[{"poster":"The SQUIP","date":"2017-08-24T03:35:15.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It wasn't turned on","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-24T03:48:01.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries, it's a pretty quick and easy step to check so I wanted to be sure of that first. This could also be happening if some of those game files are corrupted as well so let's go ahead and try running a quick repair through the options, and if that still doesn't help go ahead and reach out to our tech team for a little more in-depth troubleshooting.","replies":[{"poster":"The SQUIP","date":"2017-08-24T04:01:41.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I looked through forums and saw that fix, tried it, it didn't work.
