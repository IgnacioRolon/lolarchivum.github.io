Riot nerfed Yorick because unskilled players had a tough time dealing with him, so he was insane in low elo. Ignoring the fact that this type of balancing is disgusting for people who put time into non-meta champions, I am looking for input on how to buff Yorick in a way that does not make him insane in low elo. \r\nAs a person who has put more time on Yorick than every other champion, how I would change him is making him less oppressive when the ghouls land. 2 ways of doing this are nerfing the W to 2 wall hits at all ranks, or to remove the slow, but keep the speedup when landing the E. This would allow champions to have an easier time dealing with the ghouls attacking them. Even if nothing like this is added, Yorick needs his ghoul numbers increased somewhat. He is a forgettable champion, but for people who play him a lot this patch was disgusting to read and made us lose a lot of faith in the balance team.","replies":[{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2018-12-26T08:36:49.481+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uhh that W nerf looks seriously useless. His W will be 2 hits at both Rank 1 &amp; 2, and is the last ability to max. Removing the slow on his E will just make him a lot more kitable to range opponents, making him a lot worse &amp; will just force people to not bother playing him when champions like Riven exists.","replies":[{"poster":"Crimson Typhoon7","date":"2018-12-29T01:34:30.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thinking back, I definitely agree that my W change is bad because as you said you max it last.

My issue though is how the 8.17 nerfs got rid of enough damage that I can no longer punish people for making mistakes. Yorick's maiden is designed to shred tanks, but Yorick has a hard time beating them at any point of the game. I'm not for Yorick punishing everyone, but if I have all 4 ghouls and myself attacking someone and they are still outdamaging me building full tank, then I have a problem.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Grav3Warden","date":"2018-12-26T20:21:00.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to play Yorick around when I started playing the game, I don't have as much time as you do but I would like to put one idea in. I feel a big problem with yorick in higher elo at least is the fact that a lot of his damage comes from his ghouls which you need to hit your E to use them. So my idea would be to instead change his E, make it a point and click dot and either increase it's cooldown, decrease the range, decrease the duration or decrease the damage to compensate.\nAnother change I can think of is to make his ghouls die from 1 aa (as normal from melee matchups) but require 2 from ranged matchups, making him less of a pushover to ranged champions. Also, I feel as if this could be a good or bad addition to his passive. If his ghouls get buffed (which imo they should) then I believe he should have a passive where his ghouls are below the target priority of minions for towers or if they stay the same and get no buffs keep the current prioritization, 4 extra tower shots not going to your minions gives you much more time to take towers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gravesinger","date":"2018-12-26T17:50:04.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alas, poor Yorick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"y0r1ck","date":"2018-12-26T14:57:07.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some rioter said they're doing larger exploration on him, but didn't promise any dates.
