Only a year ago (I think) we had the old ranked system where you weren't given a role. You'd just be put in a numbered position in the draft and would basically choose your role when it got to your turn; lower people down being left with the scraps. Basically 1st/2nd pick was mid/adc/top and last pick was support. Point is: you **had** to know all roles to play ranked, because you never knew what role you'd be left with.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sona Ping","date":"2016-12-04T01:42:07.726+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In short:\n\n1. For a long, long time in draft mode the convention was that position was determined by pick order.  First pick, picks position and their champion first.  The rest \"fill in\" the remaining positions as they choose their champions.\n2. Last year, New Champion Select comes out where people choose two positions before they queue and the system assigns them a game with them in one of those positions.\n3.  Due to position shortages and queue times, autofill is implemented where people are assigned to fill in for a position that there is a shortage in, effectively as if they were 4th or 5th pick in the previous system.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-12-04T01:52:11.849+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Basically riot wastes 45 minutes of your life (and the lives of every other person in your game) as a way to save 3 minutes of your queue time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DestructoDave","date":"2016-12-04T01:40:33.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Someone gets support 1 out of 30 games and cries about it.
