We all told Gangplank to TP to the ward and just end it since I was close by (as Rakan) and I could speed him up for literally the most guaranteed win (the rest of the enemy team is basically right outside our base with the others defending), but after the entire team trying to get his attention, he played on as if he was oblivious to our communication.\r\n\r\nWhich is why muting both chat and pings shouldn&#039;t be a thing.\r\n\r\nYou get tilted from people pinging you to do things? That&#039;s your issue. Allies spam ping you? Just report them after game. But being able to silence your entire team of any form of communication shouldn&#039;t be a thing in any MOBA.","replies":[{"poster":"SwaT 10","date":"2017-09-06T09:38:39.532+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"gtfo i dont want to get spam pinged by retards","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-09-06T07:11:24.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some players have a hard time not raging when provoked.

It's your problem if you get provoked by pings/chat. Learn to deal with it. Muting isn't dealing with it. It's escaping the issue.","replies":[]}]}]}
