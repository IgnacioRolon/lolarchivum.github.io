I have been plagued with the League Client crashing at loading screen after Champ Select. 1 out of 10 games will load and the rest would just crash with no hope of reconnection. I am in in 20 min AFK LPQ right now. I went away from the game for a month and came back and i am still having the same issue. I still can't connect to even the custom games!\r\n\r\nI am using ethernet, i have Google Fiber 100 MBPS, i have gtx970 with an MSI gaming computer, my ping to LoL servers is 14 MS!!!!!!!! \r\n\r\nI am attaching the screenshot of internet score with this post. I hope i will get some help otherwise, i am being forced to quit the game and it is nobody's fault. I just can't get past the loading screen. It is unfortunate!\r\n\r\nhttps://postimg.org/image/gyie7wpb9/","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-13T02:17:10.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Crashing most likely isn't related to your internet connection, but you may want to try running the repair through the client options and going through the steps outlined in our [**crash guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974) as some basic troubleshooting. \n\nTest those steps out in a practice or custom game first before hopping back into normals or ranked, I don't want you getting unneeded LPQ's for crashes like these!!","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf241221024","date":"2017-12-13T03:20:05.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went through most of it and it still didn't work. While researching, i decided to type my problem in a different way because i agreed with your opinion that it might not be connection related. So i searched \"FULL HIGH graphics league of legends client crash\" and i stumbled upon a post where a RIOTER suggested deleting the Config file in the League folders. I did that! And when i started again, i was able to load a custom game. But the graphics settings were back to medium because the config file was deleted! And i put the graphics back up again to FULL high because i have a computer that can handle it without having to even blink. The RIOTER suggested that after deleting the config file and running the game (if it is able to load) we close the game again with new graphics setting so that the game can \"sync\", i am not sure what that means. But i closed the game and started it again with my FULL HIGH graphics settings. It seems to be loading every time now.\n\nOne more weird thing that i have noticed is that since i did that config thing, i don't have to change my game mode to \"Borderless\" in order to get the full FPS count. Before this, i had to put the game in Borlderless mode because in FullScreen, the game would be stuck at 60 FPS even when running on my NVidia GTX. This is also something i have never been able to understand, as to what causes the fps to cap at 60 in fullscreen and then borderless seems to fix it. But now, it is uncapped in fullscreen again, since i deleted that config file. I am REALLY confused about this whole thing.\n\nI am providing you with as much info as possible so that you know the whole deal.\n\nMy question is, the issue has been solved for now but do you know what can be the cause? Why deleting the config file made the game load again? And why turning up my graphics to full high made the game break in the first place? This is really weird and i hope this issue can be narrowed down to something! Because what are the odds of this happening again?\n\nI am not convinced because i still don't know the cause of this and it can happen again! Let us try to run a root cause analysis?","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-12-13T05:11:24.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gonna pop in here and just say that to be completely honest with you I'm not sure why it works but I've had an issue that I went back and forth with support for, spent a ton of time googling it, and finally just deleted the config and it was magically resolved.. I guess the config can screw the entire game up sometimes if it gets corrupted :P","replies":[]}]}]}]}
