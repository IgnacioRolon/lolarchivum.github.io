The wukong noticed the same thing, and I'm fairly certain he reported her for it. I don't know if it's a hack or bug, but she didn't seem to be hacking as the ports weren't really across map. It was more of like a flash's distance away from where she was originally standing on the screen.

To explain what I saw is, I was watching an allied champ fight her and then die, as the fog of war kicks in Nidalee gains something like sorakas passive (+70 movement speed boost) no abilities cast not running through any brush just randomly. Aside from that there were 2 allied champs that tried to gank her top lane and as Im watching the minimap, she appears and disappears (fog of war) then reappears next to red buff running down towards blue as if she anticipated the gank and teleported away. I know this isnt the right place to post this but here is the information.\n3:00cst (NA Server)\nNidalee (Headhunter Skin)\n\"Ranger4dangeR\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2014-10-25T03:48:13.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Hey slythe,\n> \n> Though this does sound like a manifestation of lag, if you notice Nidalee doing this in future games let us know.

I swear she was behind the enemy Sion. Then she was suddenly in front of me and killed me. Like what. Everyone else saw it, too. I was like \"You all saw that?? O.o\" and they did. I'm sorry I didn't have my replay on =/ I use to have it on often. It might be something to do with her pounce? Maybe it's related to the cone ability bug, or the quick fix to it might've caused something else? I'm not sure how to reproduce it. It was a 46 minute match and I only saw it happen once. I thought it could've been lag at first but everything else was moving fine and others also saw that giant hop across screen. You're in luck. My friend has this on replay. I just checked with him. I'll either have it ready for you to upload onto here, or upload it to Youtube and send you link. Either tonight or in the morning. So somewhere in the next 12 hours if you or someone else will still be on.\n\nP.S. What's the biggest video file size I can upload on here??","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TouchMyNautyBits","date":"2014-10-27T01:12:31.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Logged in just to say I play on an ethernet connection and this Nid thing happened to me the other day too.
