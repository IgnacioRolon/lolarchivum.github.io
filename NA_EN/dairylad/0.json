It is unbelievable how completely idiotic the developers are of this game. They don't care about anyone except the proffesionals. League used to be fun and simple but now its all bullshit with these stupid new runes. And how come riot cant make a goddamn balanced champon. A champ is either completely op or irrelivent. I like playing skarner but its basically a loss if you pick him because riot doesnt care. The only updates to champs ever made are only because of the pros. Which makes 0 sense considering that the majority of players and probably there profit is from the amateur community. I have uninstalled this game for the final time. Fuck league of legends and fuck riot.... also fuck Teemo...god hate Teemo.","replies":[]}
