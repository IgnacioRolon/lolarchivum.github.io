I get a \"Unable to connect. please check server connection\" error after about half a minute of a black loading screen. I have read the forums and tried all the options that Riot has even made videos of. I previously used to play on a MacBook that died and now I have this Lenovo laptop running Windows 10. These options to make my LoL work include: \r\n\r\n- Disabling firewall\r\n- Updating DNS\r\n- Enabling port forwarding\r\n- Reinstalling the game\r\n- Internet via cable and wifi\r\n- Updating antivirus\r\n- Updating Microsoft.net\r\n- Turning my computer on and off again\r\n\r\nI am desperately looking for a solution to get back onto the rift. If anyone else has any other suggestions as to how to fix this please do help and be the hero to my boredom and tested patience with this issue. Thankyou! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-19T17:14:51.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for all of the troubleshooting done so far, and we'd like to help!
