Its impossible for us to know if there is in fact more or less support. There are a lot of complainers, but that doesn't say anything about people who are fine with it. It just means a lot of people complain. \nAlso, the last time Riot tried to go near Lee for his 'rework, the backlash was...considerable. I mean, DAMN. The reason why the complaints didn't last a long time was because the rework itself was quickly scrapped.","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-01-08T03:03:49.093+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've definitely heard rumors about that, never seen it for myself; [is this what you're talking about?](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/jHhmhlGe-lets-talk-about-lee-sin-retune).

But for some reason, other junglers that are competitors to him (Elise, Eve, Kha, Rengar) all seem to get nerfed, and none of the other junglers receive significant enough buffs to compete.
