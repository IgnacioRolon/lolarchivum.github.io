The only reason he's as high as A tier is because he's a generally safe pick.

The only reason he's even that high is purely because there are more Kha'Zix players than most other junglers. Trust me, if there were more Rengar players out there, then this post would very much be different, most notably the word with \"Kha'Zix\" changed to \"Rengar\", or any other jungle to be frank. The only reason people lose vs Kha'Zix is because they don't know how to play against him well.
