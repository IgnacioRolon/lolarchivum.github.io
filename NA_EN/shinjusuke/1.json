We all know what&#039;ll happen is you guys give him this tiny buff to something that isn&#039;t one of his major flaws, call him \"fixed\" because he&#039;ll be slightly shinier garbage now, and then never look at him again for years if at all. He deserves more than this, seeing as he was repeatedly nerfed more than just about any champion in the entire *history* of the game and all in like 1 season where spirit stone existed as an option. \n\nI appreciate you guys looking at him, I mean that, I really do. But this is kind of a slap to the face, because it indicates not only an apparent severe lack of understanding of the champion and it&#039;s players, but also a lack of interest in genuinely improving his situation, just saying \"yeah, THAT must be why the assassin can&#039;t assassinate for shit!

I'm not denying he could use the heal buff, I'm saying if this is the *only* buff you guys are shipping out to him, you literally picked the *least* crippling of the champion's inadequacies (many of which where ham-handedly forced onto him with the almost fanatical-looking waves of nerfs you gave him), rather than any of the changes that he *actually* needs.\n\nSource for those interested: http://www.surrenderat20.net/2015/04/410-pbe-update.html\n\nReiteration for those who can't read: The heal isn't a bad buff, it just fixes the *least* interesting, *least* frustrating, *least* restrictive part of a champion who was overnerfed and is now a sad husk of the character he's supposed to be.

For these cases I am assuming Kha is 6 and has evolved Q. \n\nObviously there are exceptions to every case, so I will be using a generic champ model. Trades are assumed to be basic skill usages and auto attacks.\n\nIf the enemy decides to stand in their own minion wave (top melee is the most common observation), Kha needs to chip away at their health with Q. If they decide to trade, use W and aa to proc passive, and follow up with more aa's and a Q while they are slowed.

He can stand halfway between his melee and caster minions *and still* hit the enemy champion with a Q. It's also on a 3.5 second cooldown.\n\n> for some reason you're under the impression that Kha's W+AA+Proc will out-trade any QWER combo (or whatever the order is) of any top/mid champ.\n\nIt is unlikely that a champion will use their ult for a simple trade. Like I said earlier, Kha is level 6 and an extra point in W has been taken. If Kha has 20 bonus ad (being conservative, 10-15 comes from runes and masteries), W+AA+Proc+Q hits for 391 damage before armor. Additional auto attacks will also usually occur because the enemy is slowed. That's a pretty significant chunk of damage, especially considering Kha heals for 70. \n\nIf you want to do the math for every other laner (preferably not outstanding cases such as{{champion:92}} or {{champion:7}} ; as I said before, there are always exceptions), feel free.

Situationality is fine on his Q, especially since there's potentially a huge amount of power to be had from that, but it's not going to be as palatable when all of Kha's other evolutions offer more guaranteed bonuses. His W is the biggest offender,  and instead of making his W easier to land and clear with, I think it should facilitate Kha's diving potential against single targets. If Evolved Spike Racks fired only one projectile, for example, but temporarily isolated the primary target instead, Kha would be able to use his isolation mechanic more predictably, though still with a certain degree of unreliability.
