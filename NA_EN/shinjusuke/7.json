Looking at this from two different angles\n\n\n**The same people who have seen the discussion once continuing to follow it** \n\nRight now the only way for you to easily keep track of threads you've read is either to bookmark them, or get notifications about replies to your posts. We definitely think there needs to be more ways to keep track of evolving discussions that you're interested in, and we hope to bring new mechanisms to do so over time.  \n\nLots of people in GD do that now by just checking the front page every now and then. Since it's not really easy to get old content to the front page, we'll definitely have to solve that problem another way.\n\n\n**New people following the discussion once it's not highly visible**\n\nThis is where it gets tricky and I'd like to get more opinions. I generally think that most of the quality and diversity of discussion comes in the first few hundred posts, after which *most* of the major points have been made and the discussion tends to stray off into side conversations. If we solve the previous problem then I think that people will still be able to keep track of those side conversations however - it will be a lot more difficult for new people to discover the discussion.\n\nMy hope is that if the topic becomes relevant enough again for the discussion to shift substantially, that it would actually be appropriate to repost the same, (or an adjacent) topic and have a different discussion.\n\n**tl;dr** We still want to have some ways through searching to find big meaty old topics, but we are currently not planning on optimizing \"new people finding old topics once they're not highly visible\" but definitely think we need to solve \"I want to follow this discussion for awhile once it's off the first couple of pages\"\n\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"ratcharmer","date":"2014-02-25T21:08:51.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I generally think that most of the quality and diversity of discussion comes in the first few hundred posts, after which most of the major points have been made and the discussion tends to stray off into side conversations.\n\nI actually think there's a lot of good points mixed in with the later discussion, it's just usually *really* hard to find them, so they tend to get overlooked (both in community beta and the old forums).\n\nIt's sort of awkward because it feels like  if you don't get your point in right at the very beginning of a discussion then no one will ever see it, which encourages posting knee-jerk reactions instead of giving well thought-out feedback.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2014-02-24T22:48:21.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as a favoriting feature of some kind is released I will happy with just that. Even more so if the OP can initiate an \"update alert\" so that why I (if I was OP) could do small edits here and there and not bother anyone, but then I could push the \"updated\" button to alert followers about a new section, a huge re-write, or simply a section edit I wanted opinions on. The last example being the most important for me as I have 4 guides out currently and am planning on at least 10 more.\n\nAs far as new viewers finding old content I think there's a whole other avenue available to pursue. Why not go **through the actual person** posting? I think having the **profile tool** that we do now is awesome, and I see a lot of potential for it still. Specifically for this, why not have each member of the CB **have their own \"front page\"**? A page we can **customize ourselves** (like 5 posts or so) with what we want people to look at. All our own posts, and they can be as old as ever, but be ones we want feedback on or simply just want viewed. This has flaws like anything, like being the best tools for downvote fairies and trolls, and sounding a lot like facebook, but my point stands that the profile tool can be another way to chase after older content and other features (reputation system!!!).

It's far more appropriate and useful to create a new post with the update (like we did with the community beta update). You could even link back to previous iterations of the post.\n\nBut imagine what it would be like to be a new person clicking into a discussion that's months old and has hundreds or thousands of comments. Where do you even begin? Sure, some people who are super interested and have tons of time might want and be able to, but it comes at the risk of alienating a far larger percentage of possible viewers.\n\nAnd remember that everyone who posts wants their post to have visibility. Things need to fade away in order for new and relevant stuff to surface. You can always create a new post when there's a relevant update to be made.\n\nIt's just a slight shift in perspective: rather than making a single \"living document\" that contains every comment ever made on the matter and could potentially scare people off, it's about serializing it into chapters as new stuff emerges, and allowing the conversation to renew with new eyes and new blood.","replies":[{"poster":"Shinjusuke","date":"2014-02-24T23:03:10.318+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So in my referenced case of for example a champion concept, the suggestion would be to make an entire new thread after X amount of time?\n\nWhile I recognize everyone deserves viewership (and I don't mean to start an argument about this subject here, but), isn't that the BIGGEST complaint for the new forum vs GD? That people don't won't have equal chance of viewership?\n\nIn the event of the Champion Concept thread, what if the goal were to get viewership from many members of the community and hopefully some people who have some say-so at Riot in Champion Design?\n\nPeople are more prone to go see \"what's up\" with a thread when the thread has a crapton of views and upvotes, because it means it's something being frequently and thoroughly discussed. Where would the benefit be in starting a new thread about a slightly updated version of the same concept when the current concept has 500 upvotes and 100+ pages, thus showing an interest in the subject by many people?\n\nI guess my point is, getting people's attention, and getting Riot's attention, requires work. It'd feel like punishment to have to restart a thread regardless of how popular it is or how much work and discussion has gone into it simply because it's older than a few days/weeks. \n\nPeople *rarely* read any comment past massive wall of comments, you're right, but when the current format shows the top comments on a subject like this, how does a new thread on a subject help encourage new feedback, when people are likely to make some of the same comments that were made in the previous iteration of the thread since comments from the first thread would no longer be visible in the new thread?\n\nAn example (since that was kinda wordy):\n\n**Thread 1**: Blahblah, super champion.\n\nQ: does 70 damage\nW: something\nE: something\nR: something\n\n\n**top comment**: \"Q does too much damage, needs to drop down\" \n*Q is lowered to 50 damage*//\n*thread gets 500 upvotes*//\n*Blahblah reaches a state most in the thread agree is best*//\n*thread gets old and dies, despite continued iteration on Blahblah*//\n\n**Thread 2**: Blahblah, super champion, v2\n\nQ: does 50 damage\nW: something\nE: something\nR: something\n\n**top comment**, from a different poster who didn't read first thread:\n\"Q does too much damage, needs to lower\"//\n*people from old thread don't feel need to look at new thread*//\n*Q is lowered to 30 damage*//\n\nThis wouldn't help discussion a whole lot and might end up in the same vein of comments being posted instead of providing new points.\nWhile I recognize it's for a specific issue (Namely, potential game concepts), can you see how this might be detrimental for those of us looking for continued feedback on the same subject?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-02-24T23:18:54.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's assume I'm a forum goer, and I see a thread with a whole bunch of upvotes and a whole bunch of comments. Personally, I don't think 'wow, that thread is huge! I don't want to put in the effort of having to read through everything, so I'll just ignore it.' \n\nI think 'that's either an amazing thread full of great ideas or a bunch of people circlejerking over things already said. Let's find out!' Assuming that it is the first option, I WILL, in fact, read through the vast majority of the thread, and then reply with my opinion, regardless of whether it was said or not, and then I will proceed to join into the discussion.\n\nAm I not statistically significant enough to matter? I understand that I'm probably in the minority, here, but if I want to see those huge threads that have tons of posts, will I be able to? There is the 'best' option but that assumes that it gets enough upvotes during the initial surge.\n\nIf the idea is 'if you want to continue to topic, make a new thread' well, that's just gonna make the number of threads on this forum explode, with people making new threads every time theirs drops off the first page. People will use threads in order to respond to other threads that have fallen off 'hot'. This makes the discussion difficult to follow.\n\nMeanwhile, in GD, if a thread goes on for a long time, it shows up on the front page every time it gets posted in. Sure, this leads to posts with nothing of substance, which exist solely to draw more attention to the thread, but I feel that's a necessary evil.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Roaranor","date":"2014-02-24T20:38:55.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They have 3 sorting features.
