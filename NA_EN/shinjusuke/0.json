He&#039;s a near-useless addition to a teamcomp in almost all situations, no matter how you slice it.  He&#039;s incredibly fun to play, but the fact that once laning is over you&#039;re stuck a squishy mixture of DPS and burst (but not enough of either to warrant picking him for it), who&#039;s barely useful in a teamfight because he still needs peel and doesn't really know if he wants long fights or short ones.\n\nThis isn&#039;t to say he&#039;s a bad champion by any means. Rather, I believe he&#039;s a legitimately powerful champion. The problem is there&#039;s no *reason* to pick Teemo in any given game over any other given champion in the roles he can fill or in what he brings to the table. His iconic traits are his blind, his poisons, and his shrooms, and none provides enough worth to a team to justify him over any other champion who can fill the role he&#039;d be in. Thus, we have a numerically strong champion with potentially powerful laning, who doesn&#039;t snowball exceptionally well (compared to pretty much any other assassin or DPS carry), who also doesn&#039;t have a reason to be picked.\n\nThus, the \"Teemo Problem\", and why people hate seeing Teemo on their team in blind/draft pick, and why people kick him from rooms in Team Builder. Nobody wants the champion on their side, and frankly (as someone who plays like 80% assassins) the other team usually is happy to see him on the other side because he&#039;s usually free assassin kills.\n\nAs such, the biggest thing Teemo needs is a defined role. A reason you&#039;d pick him, and a goal in mind as a champion. Here is what I propose: \n\nThe most defining thing about Teemo, I think, is his map control via his shrooms, and his \"unexpected damage\" potential via his stealth nature and poisons. Taking those traits and emphasizing them provides the champion with a distinct purpose, that would also extend beyond laning and into the teamfight/roaming phases of the game.\n\nPlease, bear with me, it&#039;s a long read, and I understand if you have better things to do, but I hope you&#039;ll find it&#039;s worth it.\n----------------------------------\n***PROPOSED KIT CHANGES***\n\nAs actual number values would undoubtedly need tweaked, I intend to provide only a few estimates, as what I&#039;d like to sell people on is the concept *behind* the kit rather than numbers outright. I do, however, have \"guesses\" I&#039;d like to share to provide an understanding of where I believe his power should be in this kit.\n\n\n**Q**: His Q, at the moment, is a fairly-heavy nuke with a blind attached. While this is a key skill for Teemo (and I believe heavily ingrained in who the champion is now), I think having it be the only \"raw burst\" skill in his kit is a hindrance to his character. I propose that his Q have some of it&#039;s up front burst taken off, and in exchange have it provide a poison effect that causes Teemo&#039;s poisons to deal a percentage of the afflicted champion&#039;s missing health as magic damage. This damage would be heavily tied to his AP scaling, with almost no base value, to prevent bruiser or AD builds from abusing it.  It also would only have one instance active at any time, meaning each poison wouldn&#039;t apply a separate missing %hp burn, but as long as they were poisoned from *something*, the burn would keep going. Q itself would apply the missing hp poison for 4 seconds.\n\n**W**: Mostly remaining unchanged, the one difference being something I&#039;d rather address in his R section (but could go here instead for leveling purposes)\n\n**E**: Unchanged, with the exception of the DoT effect applying the new Q effect.\n\n**R**: The shrooms are, frankly, the most iconic thing about Teemo. I feel as if playing them up in his kit is a strong solution to \"The Teemo Problem\". Firstly, the base damage would need nerfed somewhat. However, There are a few major changes I would make to how the shrooms function. There are 4 changes I have in mind:\n\n--\"Teemo gains a (large) X% move speed boost for (thinking 3) Y seconds while moving towards a champion afflicted by his poison shrooms\" \n>The intent of this is to provide Teemo a distinct role as a \"pick off\" assassin. This gives him strength as a roaming threat, as well as a much stronger thematic tie-in, and cements a real play pattern. Teemo places a shroom (or minefield of  them), and waits *nearby* for an enemy to step on it, at which point he leaps from hiding and picks them off. The problem, currently, is that in order to benefit from his passive attackspeed steroid, you have to almost be on top of his shroom to utilize the bonus. This way, Teemo can actually set \"traps\", and hunt people down, rather than people knowing \"either he&#039;s right here where I&#039;m standing or not around at all\". The move speed boost could either be tied to his W rank or R rank, depending on how Riot would want him to progress through the game.\n\n\n--\"Stepping on Teemo&#039;s shrooms cause his poisons to shred X% (thinking 3.5%) of afflicted target&#039;s magic resistance each tick, up to a cap (thinking up to 24.5%) that persists as long as the enemy is suffering from one of Teemo's poisons.\"\n\n>This does several things for Teemo. First, combined with the addition of missing %hp damage on Q afflicted targets, solidifies him as a killer of frontline champions in a teamfight. Whereas, currently, in a teamfight Teemo serves little purpose beyond some standard DPS and a blind on an ADC, this provides him a distinct role: Hang back and shred their frontline champions, leading their team through minefields as able. Furthermore, this gives Teemo an ultimate your team *wants* for teamfights, as well as incentiving your team to utilize his minefields, even if he&#039;s *not* snowballing. Providing a shred effect on the enemy team allows a lot of \"disengage and re-engage\" potential, turning what looks like a lost fight into a winnable one should the enemy team follow you to a bad place. \n\n>The purpose of causing all his poisons to apply the shred effect is twofold: Firstly, Teemo&#039;s shroom poison lasts 4 seconds, meaning that a single shroom would shred 14% MR after it&#039;s final tick. For comparison, Karthus wall shreds 15% instantly and Kayle passive shreds 15% after 5 attacks. This caps out a single shroom at a shred effect that&#039;s by itself rather weak compared to other shreds, considering it *needs* 4 seconds to reach 14%. However, this allows for enemies to be punished more and more (and Teemo rewarded for intelligent placement) when they walk through an unchecked area or chase too hard (that 3rd shroom will hurt something fierce). The 2nd value is that having *all* Teemo&#039;s poisons apply the shred means that the shred is vastly more useful against whichever champion Teemo is concentrated on. A single champion suffering from shrooms poison, Q poison, and his E poison would increment 10.5% MR shred each second (3.5 from each poison), reaching the cap after the 3rd poison tick, making him rather capable 1 on 1.\n\n--\"Time until Teemo stores another shroom is decreased by X (thinking 0.5) seconds each second an enemy champion is poisoned by Teemo's abilities.\"\n\n>More interactive than simply a flat cooldown decrease, I feel this allows Teemo to place more shrooms without encouraging the passive play that is part of what makes the champion undesirable-for-buffs on Riot&#039;s end. This way, Teemo can create a more robust minefield, without not needing to work to achieve it.\n\n-- Allow Teemo to \"lob\" shrooms. Increase their placement distance by somewhere between 70 and 100 units.\n\n>Understandably, Teemo&#039;s shrooms have a small placement range, in order to prevent them from being used as a reliable \"poking\" tool or to not care about where he places them. This change, however, I would make for a multitude of reasons. Firstly, it allows him to place shrooms over many of the walls he previously could not. Second, it allows him the freedom to place shrooms in more useful positions in a teamfight without going horrendously out of position to do so. Third, it allows him to be slightly less obvious about shroom placement while ducking in and out of sight when he&#039;s being chased. Obviously, you *want* a heavily restricted placement range (he should be rewarded for preemptively *setting up* an effective network, not placing on the fly ***cough** Rek&#039;sai **cough***), but this opens up some freedom to the ability&#039;s usage without fundamentally changing the shrooms use or granting too much effectiveness without proper setup. Plus, seeing as many times in a fight Teemo shrooms on top of himself before running away anyway, this just allows him a little more freedom about utilising them to escape.\n\nAs I stated before this large block about his shrooms, it would likely need to see some base damage nerfs to compensate for the added power. However, I ***strongly*** feel there is significant benefit to pushing his shrooms in this direction, for his identity as a character, his usefulness on a team, and his playstyle as a whole. \n\n-----------------------\n***DAMAGE CHANGES***\n\nGranted, both his Q and R would need compensatory nerfs to their damage (DOT on shrooms and base nuke on Q, obviously), but not too hard. Damage Over Time effects have a bit of a wider berth with regards to their damage output, as there is a *SIGNIFICANTLY* higher window for reaction time, as you often have several seconds to do something about a slowburn damage source than, say, the up-front instadeath provided by most assassins (Leblanc for example). You obviously couldn&#039;t just *add* MR shred to his current shrooms and missing %hp poison to his current Q, but he really wouldn&#039;t need terribly high number reductions on either ability in order to remain balanced. The goal would be for his damage *over the duration* of an attack on a shroomed target to be higher than Live, but up front it&#039;d be less.  His poison durations are 4 seconds, and that&#039;s basically 4 chances to say \"oh, Teemo&#039;s gonna kill me, i should pop heal/barrier/zhonyas/pots/whatever\". His DOT can be higher than Live if his Q burst and base R damage are lowered a *little* bit. \n\nI feel his R should do less damage on Live with a *single* shroom, but if a 2nd shroom is hit (or Teemo follows up) before the MR shred wears off, the net change in damage should be an increase from Live. My rough guess would be a drop to 160/260/365 base damage over 4 seconds (scalings unchanged) as opposed to current Live values of 200/325/450 over 4 seconds. \n\nHis Q still needs to be a decent poking/lasthitting tool, but I feel like lowering it&#039;s base damage to 65/110/140/175/200 and it&#039;s scaling to somewhere between 50 and 55% would be enough to justify the addition of a 1%+(1% per 140/135/130/125/115 AP) missing health poison effect addition. Currently, Live Q does 80/125/170/210/260 + 80% AP, for reference.\n\nI could be ***way*** wrong, as I've not tested the math extensively or been able to test it in-game, but that&#039;s why I&#039;m asking Riot to playtest this. \n\n------------\n\n***PLAYSTYLE, PURPOSE, REASON-TO-PICK***\n\nIdeally, this kit accomplishes a few things, and these are reasons I like it to be considered.\n\n-First, his role as a character (and \"class\") is much more strongly defined. Teemo would excel at picking off enemy champions who wander off alone, following up on someone who steps on a shroom by bursting in with a large amount of move speed, Q&#039;ing them and autoattacking a few times while they're blinded, and then running away and letting the poison do it&#039;s work (or leading them through more shrooms) before the enemy team can interfere. He&#039;d be an excellent \"pick off stragglers/lone roamers\" assassin, in a similar style to what Kha&#039;Zix is (supposed to be) good at, but with more prep work and more potential counterplay time. \n\n-Second, his role in a teamfight is much more obvious. He&#039;s definitely an assassin, but rather than focusing on the \"high-priority\" targets, such as Marksmen and Mages, he&#039;d primarily focus on taking out their frontline, especially fighters and bruisers.  He&#039;d be especially effective at ducking in and out of a fight and harassing their frontline, or stealthing in the back of the team before unexpectedly joining what the enemy team expected to be a 5v4. He&#039;d be effective bait as a setup for a teamfight, harassing the enemy team into chasing him into an MR-shredding shroom or two and the rest of his team, before engaging with his backup for a much more deadly teamfight.\n\n-Third, there&#039;s now a *reason* to pick Teemo. You pick him into an enemy teamcomp focused on abusing splitpush champions, as he wants to catch lone shroom-poppers, or a into an enemy teamcomp heavily emphasizing bulky, frontline fighters (nasus, vi, darius, etc), as he&#039;d excel at messing up thoughtless engages or champions who go in too deep on your carries. When you&#039;d have a Teemo on your team you&#039;d now have a thing *that Teemo provides better than other champions*, which is not the case with Live Teemo.\n\n-Lastly, Teemo&#039;s current playstyle is incredibly passive. He never really goes on the offensive, and it encourages a low-interaction playstyle and frankly a potentially very boring experience for both parties. This heavily enforces a much more interactive and aggressive playstyle on Teemo, which is better for the champion, the players, and (as Riot isn&#039;t a fan of non-interaction) the game as a whole.\n\n-------------------\n\n***WRAP UP AND THANK YOUS***\n\nI already have a bunch of ideas in mind to swing him to a more powerful or less powerful state were people to agree he&#039;d be one or the other, but that&#039;s the base point I&#039;d work with. Please, if this interested any of you forum-goers, I implore you to grace this rework idea with some upvotes and comments (admittedly I&#039;d prefer civil, polite ones, even if you hate it). That goes for you Reds too, I&#039;d love to hear some opinions.\n\nLike I said, PLEASE try to not focus on the numbers too much, the point is the *design direction* he&#039;d be pushed in, not the exact numerical state.\n\n\nThanks again to any and all who took the time to read the whole thing. If I could give a TLDR that wasn&#039;t like a paragraph long anyway, I would, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s realistic.","replies":[{"poster":"Rothmi","date":"2015-04-11T21:12:27.556+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"I wouldn't change anything in his original kit except:\n\n* Passive: Placing a mushroom while stealthed immediately stealths the mushroom and does not break your stealth.\n\n* W: Active movement speed buff much higher, but have it decay. I'd say something like ~70% decaying to the current active's value over 1.5 seconds. As well, while stealthed by his passive, activating W will not break stealth and he remains invisible until the Active bonus goes on cool down. \n\nThis fixes two of his major issues, that his \"stealth\" is irrelevant in most team fights, and that he cannot get shrooms down on a battlefield before a teamfight. This way he can wait for Stealth, activate W, run around putting down the invisible shrooms instantly and then burst out of stealth guns blazing, or he can wait as the W goes on cool down, wait until it comes off or enemies appear.","replies":[{"poster":"Terchio","date":"2015-04-12T09:11:20.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> ...This way he can wait for Stealth, activate W, run around putting down the invisible shrooms instantly...\n\nHow so?

My gods!\"\n\nIt would only last for the duration of his W active. Another way to reduce him from spamming W is to nerf the passive bonus, so the whole abilitiy would look something like this:\n\n> Move Quick: 40 Mana, 20 Cooldown\n> Passive Bonus movement speed: 12/ 14/ 16/ 18/ 20% while undamaged by an enemy champion or structure\n> Active: 70% Bonus movement speed decaying to 24/ 28/ 32/ 36/ 40% over 1.5 seconds and lasting a total of 3 seconds. This cannot be stopped by champion or structure damage.\n\nAnd this isn't going overboard. This stealth would only last 3 seconds total, and his stealth right now is very one dimensional and this would make it vastly more usable. In the past if you tried to hide to escape you couldn't; any time you did you were already far enough away so much so that the invisibility didn't help otherwise. Now you can hide, then scoot out under their noses or re-position for ambush.","replies":[{"poster":"Terchio","date":"2015-04-14T10:05:04.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"While one-dimensional, it works well enough on Assassin Teemo already. He doesn't need a 1.5 second mobile stealth *while casting*, even if the duration is dropped to compensate (and, btw, would be unbalanceable... Current kit's 3 second boost is far too much, while 1.5 seconds would be more of a nerf to his current kit, even with the modification). If his kit were entirely the same aside from this \"fix\", he'd have far more aggressive kit behavior than a turtling opportunist kit should allow, and he'd have some of the worst kit confusion this game has, even after some of these crazy reworks.\n\nAnd really, his kit is annoying enough with stealth shrooms. Make his kit any more obscenely stealth reliant, and Teemo will end up with the Eve treatment. Yeah, like that.","replies":[{"poster":"Rothmi","date":"2015-04-14T10:46:06.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does last 3 seconds still, only the 70% lasts 1.5 seconds, which it decays over the 1.5 seconds and then gives the other bonus over another 1.5 seconds, for a total of 3. So in total it is a straight *buff*. And it isn't unbalanceable, numbers are numbers: if broken nerf the numbers till they work, not that hard. \n\nIt **doesn't** work well enough, which is why we want to change it. Every single movement ability in the game is designed to be used aggressively, and gives some benefit for moving forward instead of back... Except Teemo's W, which is so one-dimensional that it has absolutely no place in League. *Just good enough to kind-of function* isn't Riot's standards and it shouldn't be ours.","replies":[{"poster":"Terchio","date":"2015-04-14T19:25:06.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"He has about a 50% winrate while used in about 8% of all games, the latter being above average. Methinks Teemo just isn't your thing. His meta is top at the moment, for crying out loud. Fluffy, helpless champions don't end up up there. He's squishy, sure, but if you use his kit right, he'll force the enemy to make gambles due to his range, and then the fight's completely at Teemo's mercy. If he doesn't expose himself, he usually pokes down the enemy before they can solidly land their combo, and with the highly burst/DPS mix in his kit tied with the lack of taking DPS (because of blind), he most certainly has his tools.\n\nSo, unless you can make that pattern less exhausting to face, he and his W aren't going anywhere. He has his niche, and until that needs revamping because it's overly powerful (arguable), he is definitely not getting any new toys, especially those that break his kit into a new pathway that reduces Teemo's already low predictability due to his stealth shrooms and the lack of counterplay from them.","replies":[{"poster":"Rothmi","date":"2015-04-14T20:13:02.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And I think Teemo isn't your thing, because he clearly isn't a meta top. Right now, 2015 it wouldn't be called the \"**Tank Meta**\" if Teemo was a viable pick. (Just as a state of reference, for the tank meta it includes tanks going both top and jungle, and sometimes support if the carries have the potential scaling to pick up where the team lacks. Meta picks include Sion, Hec, Mao, Irelia, and sometimes Fizz or Shyvana top, with Gragas, Sej, Nidalee and Rek'sai in jungle. Some variation includes Sion in the jungle, and if they have an assassin or Urgot mid then Cho is a very strong counter to either.)\n\nThose numbers you referenced are no way a measure of what is meta in the game, the better frame of reference is ban rate, as *if he was meta, then people would be banning him.* Currently he has a 0.88 ban rate, meaning that out of 10,000 games, someone is worried that the enemy team might play Teemo, and this is between all tier's of competitive play, including bronze which is exactly where all your numbers are coming from. \n\nAs well, you claim he is played in 8% of games, but forget that *not everyone owns every champion.* Their are many players who play what they have, and *many* will play the basic or easy champions as they try to gain IP to get the more expensive ones. \n\nAnother issues is that Teemo very distinctly lacks range. If you see the enemy top be a Teemo, you have your team play someone like Nunu jungle or Gragas or Sej, so that when he ganks he can easily be slowed enough for you to kill him. \n\nAnother issue is that, unless you aren't playing a tank top right now (which doesn't make much sense, and I get players want diversity from the meta, but those numbers don't lie.) Your first item, a tank item, will always be much better than his first item, as he lacks proper itemization paths. Many people argue that Teemo's best first item is Lyandry's, but it leaves a lot to be desired and while it gives good combat stats he is easily out-scaled by others. \n\nThe fight isn't completely at Teemo's mercy, because unless you let him get fed then he shouldn't be an issue in the first place. If you are Teemo and I am hecarim, I can deny you from all the farm I want and no matter how far your auto attack range is or Q blind I can still out run you, even if you had your W. \n\nAnother issue with your argument is that his shrooms are uncounterable, which is *very* much a lie because there is such things as pink wards or red trinkets or raptor buff, all are very easy for you to use. As well most all his mushroom placements are extremely predicable, like if you see him hanging around top lane for the first twenty minutes of the game then it's fair to assume that there are no mushrooms in the bottom lane. But then it goes even further, like if you don't see him in the jungle then there are no shrooms in the jungle, and if you think there are shrooms then you can sweep the area or avoid the corners of junctions where you can assume he put one. Also most Teemo players try very old standard tricks to get people to step on his shrooms. \n\nIt would appear your argument is falling apart friend.","replies":[{"poster":"Terchio","date":"2015-04-15T04:51:53.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone's a little full of himself, maybe. At any rate, Teemo is most certainly either a Top or a Jungle meta, because he's got very defined weaknesses in the other lanes. Teemo doesn't block any burst damage from your mages in mid, doesn't have sufficient CC/heal from 1-6 for support, and doesn't have the range for ADC. Therefore, he's seeing nearly none of his 8% pickrate's time outside those 2 spots, the \"tank meta\" spots, and still seeing a 50% winrate. Furthermore, while Teemo is \"more readily available\" than most other champions, he rocks a pickrate higher than 9/12 of the 450 IP champions, and is quite in the middle of the group for 1350 IP champions. Super cheap doesn't mean super popular.\n\nAlso, ban rate is a cute sidestep, but even with Teemo's banrate at .88%, he's still quite healthily in the middle of the pack. Ban rates are as skewed as anything can be because everyone and their grandpa picks the same bans. You can sort and find that out, but I'm sure you already knew that, you're just spewing BS at this point.\n\nAs far as tank meta goes, that's nothing new. It's been that way for a few seasons now... The ADC tops were always just a sprinkle in the mix, and the casters always had something beefy about them. Just because Ryze and Vladi can't keep up with the bulky bunch doesn't mean that all casters are gone (Cass, for one, is still up there), and even if it did, it means Teemo would have to face fewer casters... Basically his dream.\n\nAnd the shrooms... They are counterable in the same sense that wards are counterable, and that's pretty pitiful at this point. Raptor buff is about as good as it gets, which is sadly short of meaning much of anything because, worst case scenario, Teemo runs while they kill the shroom in the way. Also, Raptor uses itself on the first shroom they approach (and those nearby), so attention to setup can completely negate that buff, too.The issue is that no Teemo does have just 1 shroom in the way if they're worth their weight. They have several lined up in ideal locations, and there is no certainty that any ganker will actually reach any Teemo, should they somehow survive that damage. If you're dying frequently as Teemo after level 6, you're simply shrooming wrong or taking too little caution with an empty minimap.\n\nAnd that is exactly why Teemo never will see any type of utility added to his kit. He already has remote utility with high power, and as long as you don't stand there and watch them come at you, he will safely pelt away at a distance with very few options to counter him, even with his (somewhat) limited mobility.\n\nThere are many champions with limited mobility who are hurting with the high utility champions that keep coming out. However, Teemo still has, unlike most of those characters, more than enough utility to make up for it, should he use it right.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Quort","date":"2015-04-11T22:44:03.678+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whoah! :O\n\nThis sounds fun! ._.","replies":[{"poster":"Rothmi","date":"2015-04-11T23:02:57.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea and it's real simple.

There are two main ways it makes his kit more interactive: it encourages him to follow up on his shrooms instead of just hoping they kill something, and it improves his contributions to teamfights so he doesn't have to splitpush until the end of time.  The other thread is here (I am not the OP): http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/j0PI86js-teemo-rework-compilation-of-ideas\n\nI definitely like the idea of applying more shred if Teemo is around to follow up OR they step on another shroom to refresh the duration.  It makes wading through a minefield more dangerous and encourages Teemo to use his mushrooms to ambush instead of just throwing them wherever and hoping someone steps on them.  Adding a little extra range to his mushrooms is also a solid idea.\n\nI'm not sure how I feel about the % missing HP DOT.  While DOT abilities do give the enemy more time to react, the % missing HP damage makes engaging on Teemo while low completely suicide unless you can burst him without him landing his Q.  It fundamentally gives less time to react than other DOTS because every tick deals more damage than the last, forcing you to respond right away if you want to live.  The extra kill potential would definitely help his laning phase and encourage him to try sticking to targets instead of just poking and walking away.  I don't know if improving his laning phase and his interactivity with his opponents is worth the added frustration for anyone fighting him.","replies":[{"poster":"Shinjusuke","date":"2015-04-11T19:38:51.532+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some things to consider:\n\n- Armor shred opens up AD Teemo options, which personally want to avoid due to the incredible potential safety of splitpushing AD teemo (same problems as zed of being able to escape super-easily and 1v1 most anyone who'd come after him).\n\n- The missing %HP damage has a very low scaling and a 1% base, starting at a 140 AP requirement to reach 2% hp per tick. While it might require even less scaling (like I said, numbers were just rough work), by the time it does considerable amount of damage to be \"frustrating\", laning phase will be over more than likely.  Keep in mind, the base missing %hp burn does not increase with levels in Q: Only with AP thresholds.\n\n- Taking a laning-phase example, lets say we've got a really long laning phase going on and you're at 240 AP with Q at level 5. That means the Q burn applies a 3% missing hp burn each second, with a minimum of 12% missing HP over 4 seconds. An option would be to have the Q burn itself last only 3 seconds (bringing the number down to 9%), but 12% is hardly an insane amount MR being considered, especially since the numbers would only start to make a really significant difference when you start getting low. By comparison, assuming Vayne has built any attackspeed and is at a comparable point in the game, she should be hitting 1.5 attacks a second at *least*, and is dealing 8% *maximum* health (plus 60 base) as true damage every 2 seconds you're dueling her. Hopefully that puts it in perspective somewhat, damage-wise. \n\n- Teemo is, at his core (and *especially* with this proposed rework) an Assassin. Comparing to many, **many** other assassins, this is a very slow burst. The majority of fed assassins can quite literally instantly delete you, so having a burn tied to how much HP they're *already* missing and restricted to one tick each second makes him more than reasonable. Not to mention, the amount of AP investment required in order to produce really devastating results is very large. You point out \"engaging on Teemo while is completely suicide\", which is true and as it should be. He's an Assassin. If you engage on *any* assassin while you're low without gettin the jump on them, you're committing suicide. In Teemo's case you'd even have a chance to kill him, even if you'll die in the next few seconds afterward (can't say that about Zed, or Lee Sin, or Leblanc, or Fizz, or Akali, or... you get the idea).\n\n- I may be being redundant here, and I'm aware I said \"Don't focus on the numbers\", but as I pointed out, this shouldn't exceptionally improve his laning phase, and in fact I was going for a heavier emphasis on reinforcing him as a jungler. Granted, I don't want to \"take away\" lane Teemo, but lets be honest: It's not where his kit belongs. Even if you were to play Teemo in lane with this kit, I find it hard to believe (unless you get him very fed) that a slow missing hp burn with an incredibly high AP threshold requirement to raise 1% is something you could really call \"oppressive\".\n\nYou're welcome to disagree and I appreciate the contributed thought, I'm just trying to hopefully clarify some things a bit and alleviate some concerns about where the strength of the champion is supposed to be.","replies":[{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2015-04-12T13:02:20.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if this unlocks a new type of assassin?

Seeing as on average you'd hit between 400-600 AP endgame, that means a 6-7% missinghp burn per second (which considering it wouldn't be terribly high until they're low HP and isn't accounting for MR seems reasonable).

This turn Noxius trap in a 4 rank skill, but don't be afraid the first rank shroom its basically to help him to clear the jungle, the slow and damage its very awful, another important change in Noxius Trap its that now his \"store amount\" its change based on his Noxius trap rank, this its to avoid that Teemo can put a lot of shrooms repeatly in the pre 6 state, the stun is to help Teemo clear the first camps, like I said before the rank 1 Noxius Trap its to help him to clear and gank in pre 6 state, scouting the enemy jungle, giving his allies vision, setting up traps to protect lanes, and counter ganking with his invisibility... Also in the late game Teemo can have more store chance to make more funny his late-game.\n\nAnd its this my Teemo Jungler kit, without change his core \"gameplay\" amazing no? Oh wow I was just throwing out how I feel about it and this got a lot of approval. I don't really want a rework. Just something to make him work as a jungler. He can very well do it atm just not as efficient as other junglers without some sort of kick in it. \n\nSo what are yor thoughts on this Teemo Jungler, its too OP or can be a viable jungler?","replies":[{"poster":"TonyTonyMordecai","date":"2015-04-12T15:33:24.994+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very nice, this could work as well!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JedenVojak","date":"2015-04-12T20:57:41.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sorry you lost me at \"no base scaling to prevent bruiser builds from benefiting from it\". Bruisers need % scaling too.\n\nThe \"problem\" that Teemo has is he's a strategic champion with no play making ability, so people think he's bad. In other words, they're looking at him wrong.\n\nLook at Teemo's kit and what he does:\n-a passive that makes him invisible if he doesn't move for a bit\n-a high initial hit poison shot that blinds his opponent\n-passive move speed for him not being attacked, with an active boost if he needs it\n-on hit poison damage\n-exploding mines that grant vision while they're up\n\nAll of these things point to Teemo being played in a very deliberate, guerrilla tactics kinda way with a high emphasis on attrition; people underestimate the ability to regularly force enemies to back even if they don't get the kill. Teemo is not supposed to stand and fight his opponents, he's supposed to get the jump on them and run - he has damage through dots to encourage a guerrilla style warfare play, and proper use of his passive requires being in the right place ahead of time, while clever placement of his mushrooms ahead of time means he can lead people into all sorts of nasty traps.\n\nYour changes seem to be made with the intention of making him some kind of \"roaming assassin\" who swoops in for a kill when some hapless soul steps on his mushrooms, but that's not what Teemo is. Teemo is a thinking mans champion, of which there are entirely too few in this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Shinjusuke","date":"2015-04-12T23:30:14.059+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry I \"lost you\", but I can't help you not understanding or being unwilling to understand. That's on you.\n\nYou can talk about Teemo being a \"thinking man's\" champion to pat yourself on the back, and you can say he has a specific playstyle, and that's more than fine as your opinion.\n\nBut he's in the wrong game, then, and that's the point. There is no room for a champion who has zero interest in contributing to the team in a team-based game, which is why every person saying \"Teemo isn't bad he's just playing his own game\" makes me facedesk. Great. He's playing his own game. So find a game for him to play, because frankly, having only 4 champions on your team because 1 of them is so \"unique\" that he's only effective if the enemy team doesn't realize \"psh, we just have to *not* chase him around like idiots and force his team to fight instead\" is bad. \n\n*That's* the problem with Teemo. You're not so above everyone that people just \"don't understand\" his kit. Everyone \"understands\" Teemo just fine. The *problem* is that there is no reason to want Teemo on your team, and there hasn't been for several seasons, because he doesn't offer anything to the team. He's a solo champion, and in a different kind of game that'd be fine. But solo champions have no place in a game about a 5 player team against another 5 player team. That's just reality.\n\nThat said, I think giving him an *actual* benefit to his team doesn't suddenly negate the \"thinking man's\" playstyle, either, especially since not only are all the traits still in the proposed kit, but are emphasized. The ***exact same*** play pattern exists and isn't weakened, all I've done is given him the actual ability to contribute to his team in a meaningful way beyond being a solo champion who sucks at teamfights and is only functional if everyone on his team treats him like the most important character. Which ***IS*** what he is right now, and is ***exactly*** why nobody wants Teemo. Taking a step away from the arrogant \"I'm just too unique you guys don't understand me\" preteen Emo attitude and being willing to accept changes might be a pretty big step toward changing him from being a hated joke pick on teams and instead being embraced as the awesome champion he *could* be.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Eclipse1337","date":"2015-04-11T22:31:55.434+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I say his R needs to scale off of 1000% magic damage.
