You could've lowered his damage, you could have reworked his kit to be less snowball reliant, you could've done one of the billion much better suggestions for changes to him to remove the current frustration without wrecking him, but you didn't. \r\n\r\nYou went through with the one nerf path that could ruin him.\r\n\r\nThanks for listening to us guys, really nice to know the people that aren't in challenger still have a say in changes. Oh wait..\r\n\r\nYes, this is a rage thread. No it's not because Talon got nerfed. It's because you picked the ONLY nerf that doesn't just lower his power, it makes him a crappy pick. He was niche already and you removed the thing that let him fill that niche (high damage counterpick to caster mids).\r\n\r\nNow he's just there. At least he and Shaco can chill out and talk about better days together in the trash bin now :)\r\n\r\nTL:DR almost any other nerf would've lowered his power without killing him, and plenty of people offered ideas. You guys didn't care enough to listen.","replies":[{"poster":"Lyrxen","date":"2014-09-24T22:29:27.542+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dude, the nerf on him is going to destroy him\nEarly game that silence is what can save his life, and with him having an already weak early game, this is going to make him unplayable","replies":[]},{"poster":"Serpents Embrace","date":"2014-09-24T22:55:44.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't you see what they did to LeBlanc?\n\nI knew this was coming but I didn't think it would be so drastic, or stupid.\n\nI'm not really sure who is calling the shots with the design direction but this season the quality of champion reworks and buff/nerf changes has taken a nose dive.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2014-09-25T00:22:43.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leblanc is still strong.\nTalon wont be.\n/Close Thread","replies":[{"poster":"Serpents Embrace","date":"2014-09-25T00:32:29.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except she isn't, and the Talon change is just as decimating.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2014-09-25T03:45:06.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But on the contrary she is, and talon's silence is a core part of his kit, as he lacks mobility.

Otherwise stop arguing at me like your opinion is fact. Her win rate was already unnaturally low and sank after the silence change - primarily because she received no compensation for losing a large chunk of power.\n\nBut aside from that - the argument you're making was made for Kassadin and LeBlanc before Talon. It will have the same disruptive consequences and none of them were really compensated adequately.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2014-09-26T01:48:08.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It isnt really an opinion, its a fact that LeBlanc's silence was uneeded, and she did recieve compensation. Now, she is recieving even more compensation. She has a huge amount of mobility and juke potential, as does Kassadin. Her winrate being low doesnt reflect her viability or power either. She is a harder champ to play, as she has so many components to her kit to master. Winrates im afraid are not a 100% reliable source to tell if a champ is worth playing or not. \n\nTalon's silence is what made up for his lack of mobility, and it has been replaced with something that, from what I understand, does not compensate in the slightest. If he is gonna be an assassin, they either need to give him more mobility (Would ruin his diversity from others), or give him more damage on an ability to compensate. His niche is a less mobile assassin that deals more damage than others, and it needs to stay that way.","replies":[{"poster":"Serpents Embrace","date":"2014-09-26T04:43:02.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In 4.10, they changed the name to \"Sigil of Malice\" and removed the silence. That was it. You are saying she received compensation. She didn't, until 4.13 in the form of a very minor buff to Distortion. Now she's receiving another tiny buff in 4.16.\n\nSo here we come up to the root of the problem with your logic. You're miming words from me without know what they mean. In 4.10, when she was nerfed. She received no compensation, which means giving her something that has the same rough power level as what was taken away. That is **fact**. It is not up for debate. There was nothing changed about her besides the *removal* of her silence. The compensation she *has* received came much later, and in no way compares to the power of a silence or what the silence was for, more on that next.\n\nAm I arguing that she needs a silence? No, I'm not. And technically, neither does Talon. Or any other champion. In fact, as long as there is adequate compensation that covers the weaknesses that Silence covers for him now - it's fine. To continue that - what are those weaknesses is the question? You claim it makes up for a \"lack of mobility\", which is a joke considering as an assassin mobility is what he has over other classes in his E and R. What it makes up for is anti-assassination tools. It stops Zhonya's, Flash, and dash/blink abilities. It stops self heals and shields. It gives him a window to use his already high damage abilities. The 99% slow doesn't help this, which is why it isn't adequate compensation.\n\nMore mobility would not aid him in the same way as a silence. More damage, while a terrible idea on its own, would not aid him in the same way as a silence. 99% slow and even channel interrupt does not aid him in the same way as a silence. He is not \"a less mobile assassin\" niche, because that is not a niche. A niche will never have the word \"less\" in it. A niche is something that is the pinnacle of a certain skill, ability or attribute - not less. The silence removal is bad, your ideas about it are worse.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2014-09-26T20:45:29.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mkay buddy","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Binxy Prime","date":"2014-09-24T23:30:54.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Talon snowballs hard, if he snowballs at all he can jump on any squishy person and kill them before they can move because of a point and click silence.
