They have said these same things several times over a 3+ year long period, and yet *still refuse to change the champion*, purely because of his disgustingly high play rate and the fact that his flashy kit looks like \"outplaying\" to idiots who don't know what his kit does.\n\nThere's a shitload of Lee Sin QQ threads, because ***JUNGLERS ARE TIRED OF HIM GETTING A FREE RIDE IN THIS GAME***. We're tired of him being *obviously* having a kit that's way too overloaded, *obviously* being a major issue for the jungle state, and *obviously* crowding out jungle picks, yet never seeing *any* real work while every *other* champion in the role has to sit through both painful jungle nerfs and equally painful specific champion nerfs. \n\nSure, you can say \"he's not that bad\".

He's an incredibly outdated kit design, with a downright stupid amount of options, that can stomp you in your role simply because the other guy can find his QWER keys, who Riot refuses to acknowledge simply because they like how he looks. The difference is, Riot's opinion on Kassadin was that \"he probably shouldn't be an assassin, his ult's too strong\", and they eventually did some work on him. Riot's opinion on Lee Sin however is \"we ***know*** and will publicly state he's too strong and definitely way too overloaded, but frankly we don't give enough of a fuck about jungle players to do anything about it\".\n\nThat's why there's an assload of \"Lee Sin QQ threads\": Because jungle mains are ***sick*** of this bullshit, and having more and more terrible global jungle changes happen to \"add diversity\" while they ***completely ignore the single largest stranglehold in the game*** on \"jungler diversity\", who we've been saying *for years* needs to get changed, is a slap in the face.","replies":[{"poster":"Arkna","date":"2015-03-07T15:13:08.775+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Shinjusuke,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=viTET0ww,comment-id=0000000000000000000000010000,timestamp=2015-03-07T14:47:41.584+0000)\n> Sure, you can say \"he's not that bad\".

His scaling is awful, he can't afford damage if he didn't snowball, and as a tank/utility jungler, he's very poor. Last season introduced a revamped vision system that made early ganks harder. Given his bonus AD ratios, his damage plummets without offensive items. But his base stats in general are pretty bad, so he also needs defensive items. If he doesn't get supplementary gold from kills, he can't afford to do both. This season brought a revamped jungle that made the early gank window even smaller, while also making failed ganks more punishing than they've been in a while. If you gank a lane, take damage, and don't net anything, your clear really suffers. This means the other jungler will probably hit 6 first, and odds are they have an ult that contributes much more to a successful gank than Lee.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-03-07T15:08:21.264+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"His actual scaling is really fucking high.\n\nIn practice however, full ad lee dong goes in and gets blown up with hard cc.","replies":[{"poster":"Arkna","date":"2015-03-07T15:22:22.554+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cameron2325,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=viTET0ww,comment-id=0000000100000000,timestamp=2015-03-07T15:08:21.264+0000)\n>\n> His actual scaling is really fucking high.\n> \n> In practice however, full ad lee dong goes in and gets blown up with hard cc.\n\nScaling isn't solely ratios, it's how they factor into the champion's kit throughout the game.
