{"poster":"Shinjusuke","date":"2015-03-25T19:54:21.091+0000","title":"I hear many people are complaining about the Tank Meta. Here's an Assassin view you might've not had","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":112,"down_votes":13,"body":"So, apparently people are upset about the Tank Meta. With the exception of *sort've* Swain, every champion I choose to play (except when a specific pick/role is needed) is either a jungling assassin, or a mage. And even my mages are usually assassins in some capacity.\n\nSo I'm a jungle assassin guy. Instakilling bitches is how I get my jollies.\n\nIf any of you don't remember the \"Age of Mog's\" that followed the \"Age of Black Cleavers\", it was an unbearable, infuriating time where pretty every game was boring-as-hell because everything was a wet noodle fight and teamfights lasted like 3-5 minutes. It sucked. It really sucked.\n\nI don't think the current \"Tank Meta\" is anything like that. Yes, tanks are more powerful. Yes, nearly every tank jungler is currently a bit too powerful *as a jungler*. The jungle tanks could use a little nerfing. Not a lot, to be sure, but some of these tanks have faster clear speed than many damage-focused junglers through cinderhulk and that's not cool.\nBut back to my original point: The current \"Tank Meta\" is manageable. Tanks have their place, and are doing it more effectively: They're damage-sponges, frontline, and engagers. Where the problem would come from is if they were also able to win duels vs sustained damage champions of equal gold/xp, and with the exception of the few tanks who don't have the CC usually atrributed to tanks or are equally viable as fighter-like champions (meaning Mundo, Garen for example). The \"true tanks\", as I'm calling them, the ones who have the majority of their power in their ability to soak damage, CC, and engage, are actually in an okay spot. Again, the jungle tanks are a problem, but for the most part, the \"general strength of tanks\" is not that terrible.\n\nI'm going to assume that the majority of people complaining about tank-meta are not tank mains. They're likely \n**A)** Mages/mids who are upset their ult isn't killing the highest-defense guy on the enemy team, as usually that's what mages complain about, \n**B)** Assassins who are upset that they can't assassinate/duel a tank, despite tanks being the counter to assassins role-wise, or \n**C)** Marksmen/ADCs who are upset that tanks are stopping them from right-clicking until they get a pentakill. \n\nConsider this, however: Having Tanks be the \"spotlight\" of the balance discussion, as well as what teams are built around, has a few benefits, and some things you might not have considered make complaining about \"Tank meta\" kinda dumb.\n\n* If something is overpowered in the near future, chances are it's going to be Tank-related, which means a tank or a tank item will be getting nerfed rather than your favorite blight-upon-balancing (lookin' at you, Nidalee players).\n\n* Tanks are a direct counter to many of the things that are, let's be honest, infuriating champion kits that do nothing but piss people off. Regardless of how you feel about their balance state, there are a few assassins/mages that have fucking infuriating kits that offer ***absolutely zero*** fun or interesting interactions. I won't list them to prevent the \"X Y and Z are OP\" inevitable outcome, but just bear in mind those \"I have no risks and can 100-0 you\" champions are countered by Tanks being powerful.\n\n* Tanks being more powerful doesn't make the squishy targets any less squishy. If you know how to play your assassin and aren't just hopping on whatever OP bandwagon exists at the time (**cough** you saw something in LCS and think it'll carry you to Diamond **cough**), chances are you probably aren't running straight past their tank to your target *anyway*. You can still blow up that stupid little ADC with bad positioning, or that Mid who blew their spells. They're still squishy. Worry about that.\n\n* Tanks being more powerful doesn't make your mage any less stupid-high-AOE-burst. Sure, now you have a hulking mass of gross-looking muscle-meat charging at your face, but honestly, if *your* tank (or support, or both, w/e the fuck you've got goin' on) is doing *their* job, or if your teamcomp isn't garbage cuz you decided to instalock a Syndra without talking to anyone, having someone charging at you isn't as much of an issue. The only time mages seem to complain is when either \n**A)** They get assassinated, because that's the assassin's job and the mage doesn't know how to ward (\"That's the support's job!\") or position (\"Someone should've peeled for me while I'm 20 feet away from my team!\"), or \n**B)** They can't 100-0 anyone they want. Frankly, get it through your head that your Ahri isn't **supposed** to be able to kill the tank: Your ADC is. Not you. Game doesn't revolve around you, buddy. Ya got a role to play. Besides, if you're ever in danger just hit your Zhonyas, since it's CD is way too short.\n\n* Tanks being more powerful doesn't make ADCs any less powerful as late-game shredding monsters. Sure, it takes longer for you to melt through that tank (oh nooo you can't kill everyone in less than 5 autoattacks the horror), but honestly, if you were less worried about trying to get kills and more worried about doing your job (which, for the ADCs who are too selfish to know, is providing sustained damage over a teamfight and dropping objectives faster than other roles, **NOT** having the highest K/D ratio you can get), it wouldn't matter. With proper positioning, that tank can't get to you. With proper itemization, you can kill him long before he's a threat. With proper mechanics, once they're dead you guys can probably push pretty fuckin' hard. If you're too obsessed with stacking crit chance to buy a Last Whisper and BotRK, it's your goddamn fault you can't kill the tank.\n\n* It's very easy to spot what an over-powered tank looks like versus other roles. I'm not talking about what a whiney wood-tier player thinks is over-powered, nor am I talking about infuriatingly-designed kits that frankly should've never made it past the beta, I'm talking about straight numerical power. Spotting a tank who's too strong is easier to spot and agree upon than most other roles, as tanks who are too powerful tend to turn/win games more easily than other roles. If there's an OP tank, we're going to know pretty easily. Sion and Sejuani were pretty obviously too strong and people pretty unanimously agreed upon that fact, and they got nerfed incredibly quickly compared to some other junglers who've dominated the meta for several years (you know which champions you are, and if you don't oh-god-I-pity-you). TLDR: when a tank is OP, it wins games and gets noticed and nerfed pretty quickly.\n\n* For the most part, teamcomps built around what *Tank* you have are usually the most effective. I know, I know, you're the assassin/mage/adc, the whole game revolves around you and your K/D, but the fact is, building a team around what your engage/disengage is will win you many more teamfights (and games, by extension) than pretending your ability to 100-0 a single member of their team is the most valuable part of your comp. Tanks being buffed means that more (too-desperate-to-actually-learn-a-champion) people will play Tanks and be more interested in what Tank is on your team. Because of this, they are more prone to wanting to build a team around the tank. Which means more wins for you, provided you're willing to get past your ego and actually contribute to the teamcomp.\n\nSo, yes, Tank junglers are too strong in general, though not by much. But calling this a \"Tank Meta\" and acting like it's a bad thing is just silly. Get past the fact that this isn't CoD, and get past the fact that there's someone on their team you *CAN'T* kill just because you're 1 item ahead of everyone else, and you might be less angry at the \"Tank Meta\". It's a good thing.\n\nP.S.  From all my trash-talking about the roles I profess to play, you might be prone to think I'm secretly a tank main. Well, I'd invite any of you to look at my match history or ranked games or whatever you want. It's pretty obviously a heavy preference to basically everything *but* tanks.","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-03-25T20:01:00.794+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":38,"body":"You really don't like Marksmen, do you?","replies":[{"poster":"Shinjusuke","date":"2015-03-25T20:15:40.262+0000","up_votes":53,"down_votes":4,"body":"I have no problem with the champions themselves, I actually enjoy playing a few Marksmen considerably (mostly caster ones though, Lucian, Ezreal, etc. Draven's the only \"auto-attack focused\" one I like). \n\nI just think they have *massive* egos, like disgustingly huge egos.
