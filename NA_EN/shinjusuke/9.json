That is just simple reality. You&#039;re QQing about a champion who...\n\n1) Needs to hit one of the slowest skillshots in the game, twice, (because the boomerang effect is where his Q *actually* hurts) to have consistent damage output or proc his passive on anyone (unless they&#039;re completely incompetent).\n\n2) Has to **be smarter than you** (get the hell over it, if you&#039;re that predictable, he&#039;s smarter than you) in order to predict where you&#039;re going to be *3 seconds into the future* to land the stun you QQ so hard about, and has to also account for the fact *you get to see where the field will be with plenty of time to get out of it*, not to mention position in a spot that allows him to enter that zone in a very short timeframe at the same time as his target *without tipping them off to where the zone will be*.\n\n3) Needs to hit you with an ultimate that ***you will always know the location of and whether it&#039;s off cooldown as long as you can see Ekko***. His ult  is *literally* the most telegraphed skill in the entire game. And you QQ because you get hit with it. You&#039;re bad.\n\n\n\nThere&#039;s a *reason* the people who don&#039;t think Ekko&#039;s overpowered say \"I never get hit by him\". Because he *pukes* counterplay potential all over your face. The people whining about the champion&#039;s design are just your typical \"I refuse to actually bother learning the new champion because that&#039;s hard and I don&#039;t wanna\". Learn the character, use *any* of the windows you have to fight against him (because there are a *lot*) and stop blaming the champion for your refusal to actually adapt or improve.\n\n\nThat said, if he&#039;s going to get nerfed from the whiney bronze V&#039;s who think learning is hard, here&#039;s my list of Ekko nerfs that I think wouldn&#039;t completely cripple him:\n\n- Raise Ultimate cooldown to 110/95/80 seconds from 110/90/70\n- Lower W shield to 150/180/220/260/300 (+65% AP)  150/195/240/285/330 (+ 80% AP)\n- Passive proc damage lowered to (+60% AP) from (+70% AP)\n- W passive execute damage lowered to 1.6% per 100AP from 1.81 per 100AP.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nGranted, I don&#039;t think he should be receiving ANY nerfs until a month from now when even the  most ignorant of players has to, gee, I don&#039;t know *actually learn what the champion does and how to play against him*, nor do I think doing any more than one, maybe two, of the above nerfs should happen, but there&#039;s a list.\n\nYou have a *boatload* of ways to avoid getting killed by Ekko built into *Ekko's own kit*. Even when he's hard snowballing, the *same* counterplay still exists. It's not like, say, Leblanc, who you have almost nothing you can do against if she has the damage to 100-0 you. Ekko still has a ton of things you can do, including:\n\n- Don't let him hit you with the 3rd proc of his passive. Like you wouldn't let Xin Zhao.\n- Don't be obvious as fuck so he can't land his W field on you.\n- Don't chase after an **AP STACKING ASSASSIN** when you have <30% your hp and his cooldowns are up and expect to not die (unbelievable how friggin' *stupid* people are, I swear).\n- Don't *ignore* his W field (Like seriously? People do this. You're idiots.)\n- Don't get hit by the return of his Q (or *any* part of his Q, but the return is much more important)\n- **Don't get hit by the ultimate**. For god's sake people. NO CHAMPION gives more information about when and where their ult can be used than Ekko. Not a single one. If you get hit it is **your fault**. You know if hurts, so *WATCH OUT FOR IT*. You don't ignore a Fizz's fish, or Orianna's ball, or Kat's ult, and then QQ about dying do you? I hope not. I hope you're not that stupid.\n\nIt's also worth keeping in mind that Riot apparently intends to *seriously* nerf Luden's Echo, a very-much-core item on Ekko at the moment, which means a nerf to Ekko via one of his most bought items. So there's that for you to look forward to.\n\nShower with me downvotes haters and whiners, so that I might bathe in your tears (or make a great martini out of them, I haven&#039;t decided yet).","replies":[{"poster":"ilD2","date":"2015-06-04T07:26:54.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think there are too many people who think Ekko is a \"free win.\"\nThe issue with him I hear people discuss most of the time is his 130% AP.  My only real issue with him is how often i see him played.  sure, he's a new champion, but seeing him, or any other champion in the game EVERY game is pretty obnoxious.   I've counted 22 matches in a row with an Ekko on my team, half the time on the enemy team.  It gets a little boring after a while.   good luck with that martini of sorrow.  sounds...  great.","replies":[{"poster":"Shinjusuke","date":"2015-06-04T07:38:01.426+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Sure, he's all over, he's a lot of fun and \"2edgy4me\" so a lot of people like him. That gets annoying.\n\nDoesn't make him anywhere near overpowered though, and considering you know ***exactly*** where to *not* be at *any* point in the game past level 6 in order to not get hit by Ekko's ultimate, there's no reason it shouldn't do a boatload of damage. You *can't* get hit by Ekko's ultimate if you're actually *paying attention* to it (or him). \n\nFor comparison, \n- Syndra's ult is targeted and can do up to 1280 + 140% her AP.  Assuming she hits you with her stun first (as she usually tries to do before ulting) the total damage is 1510 + 180% AP.\n- Orianna's ult->W combo (an unavoidable combo if she lands the ult, that pulls everyone with hard CC and leaves a 40% slow field) does 550 + 140%.  \n- Fizz's ult -> E combo does 720 + 175% his AP. \n\nEkko's ultimate does 500 + 130% and has no CC tied to it unless you're so thoroughly easy to read that he manages to ult into his bubble and you're inside it for some really shortsighted reason.\n\nPeople see a number and say \"OMG SO OP\" and don't *actually* know champions well enough to make sense. Tristana's ultimate up till recently had 500 + 150% AP scaling.\n\n130% for an ability with this ridiculous amount of prevention is certainly not ridiculous, and *definitely* not unheard of. People just don't know wtf they're talking about when they QQ about it.","replies":[{"poster":"OyddAWqJ5r","date":"2015-06-04T10:23:47.723+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"His ult damage makes up for the unreliability in the rest of his kit and even then it has a precursor telling you where it will be at all times.\n\nAfter playing him I know how hard it is to land on any team with a brain and is damn impossible without Zhonyas. And it only works then if people stand on you while you Zhonyas.\n\nProbably works amazing with someone like Janna who can prolong a fight to let his ghost actually be in the fray.\n\nSo far I haven't lost lane with him. But that's because the people I play against are too afraid to even step foot near me even when they have the clear advantage. I basically beat them before we even began to fight, nothing to do with Ekko OP at all even though every one of them has said it so far.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ilD2","date":"2015-06-04T07:48:05.282+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i don't disagree with any of that.  How can I?  It's all fact.  All I'm saying is it gets old seeing the same champion played every single game.  The only champion I cant stand is {{champion:74}} but even he can be easily countered.   On that note, I'm sure most of the complaining will die down when people realize how to play against him.  Though, due to the massive amounts of fear and loathing im seeing from people in game, that may be quite a ways off.","replies":[{"poster":"Shinjusuke","date":"2015-06-04T08:43:57.397+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's what I'm trying to disperse: The \"OMG EKKO SO OP\" idiocy built PURELY from people not even trying to fight against him properly.\n\nHe has more obvious counterplay than any other champion in the game, yet people completely refuse to take advantage of it. My concern is that Riot, being the frightened little children that they are when it comes to balancing (*cough* Lee Sin *cough*) when the community has an opinion, will nerf Ekko wayyyyy too early and then he'll be garbage \n\nBecause as it turns out, when you nerf a balanced champion before people learn how to fight them (Yasuo), or buff one (Azir, Syndra) they become imbalanced. Who knew.\n\nP.S. Unfortunately, you're probably going to see Ekko in a lot of games for awhile, since the champion before him was Bard (who has a very small, very dedicated fanbase but is basically hated by everyone else), and we didn't have a champion before that for a couple months (which is a little crazy Rito D:). It's been awhile since there's been a champion that people *wanted* to play and this one has an unique and interesting playstyle.

Oh, and as you mentioned it's single target.\nCompare that to Ekko's instant \"fuck you and your friends\" button, simply because you made a wrong step or because Ekko walked into a brush.\n\nAt least when you use an argument, make sure it's has anything to do with reality.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Panwar","date":"2015-06-04T11:35:32.017+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He doesn't have to predict where you will be 3 seconds from now. The idea as an Ekko player is to set up an unwinnable choice. Either walk into the stun or walk into some damage or put yourself out of position and die to Ekko's team. \n\nIt's the same as the ultimate. Sure you can see where it is, but a good Ekko will give you the choice of being where his ultimate is, or walking into 3 memebers of his team, or just zoning you out of the entire fight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xl Kirito lx","date":"2015-06-04T09:00:37.667+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But he has 130% scaling.

The shield, the stun and the ult are all difficult to land against a skilled opponent and can be avoided by simply moving out of his field (you have 3 seconds to do it, which is a lot) and not standing on top of his ult trail, specially when he is low. A bit of a damage nerf on his easy to land abilities would be fair, and is already on the PBE.

If you don't kill everyone, you're screwed. You will die. Using it wrong or missing means death.  \n\nNidalee doesn't get punished for missing 90% of her spears. If you miss 9/10ths of Ekko's ultimates while using them for damage, you're dying 9, possibly 10 times. That's a bit more punishing than \"Guess I have to wait another 3 seconds and try again\". At level 6, Ekko's ultimate has a 110 second cooldown, and Nidalee's spear (assuming you've ranked it to 3 by now) has a 6 second cooldown. In the 110 second cooldown of Ekko's ultimate, Nidalee could fire off 18.33 spears. Nidalee has to hit ONE max range spear to outdo Ekko's ultimate for damage (spear: 300 + 120%, Ekko: 200 + 130%). Out of 18.3 tries. Hardly comparable.\n\nNot to mention, Nidalee's spears alone aren't what make Nidalee the cancer that she is: It's the fact that on top of her low cost spammable atom-bomb spears she also has a spammable pounce and heal that puts most supports to shame, along with free wards and an entirely secondary kit with no mana costs attached to it. \n\nHonestly, I'm not sure *how* you managed to make the two skills comparable in your mind besides \"they both do damage and make people mad\", but there's literally nothing the same between the two *besides* that they both do damage. Not sure how I can defend my argument against the QQ about Ekko if the retort I receive is \"you're supporting a completely different skill with no similarities\".
