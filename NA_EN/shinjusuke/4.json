His black pirate coat now is gray at best and it looks almost plastic-y now that you can't see any of the creases/folds/etc in it cuz all the shadows are gone. Furthermore, his bird form looks the worst of his skins available to be seen, IMO. If you're going to remove the shadows and lighten the tone/make the red more pale-looking, you really ought to (again, IMO) go all out and make it a parrot. At the moment he looks like Phoenix Quinn's Valor, which doesn't fit.\n\nSecond, Northern Swain's human form should, like Bilgewater Swain, have the previously black parts of his outfit go back to being black, or at least considerably darker, and the previously gray overlapping parts should be darker as well. I get you're trying to keep in-line with the Summoner's Rift VU, but he kinda looks like a gray blob now. I do, however, think the bird form on Northern Swain looks very nice, because it fits (seeing as he's a white bird) on this skin.\n\nThird, please for the love of god be careful with \"new default\" Swain (aka Tyrant). The friggin' **Leader of Noxus** should look ominous, not like he's from Candyland.\n\nI mean the overall point I'm trying to get across is that before, Swain came off as this scary-ass shapeshifting leader of a shady, almost-evilish faction, and his outfit and bird form conveyed  that. Particularly his bird form, as the darkness of it gave it an almost Resident Evil look which I loved. I'm aware the texture update *will* happen, but I seriously feel as if you're significantly lessening the character's presence and defining look by making him so light and pastel-colored. \n\n\"Scary and ominous Tyrant\" into \"villain from a kid's show\" is not a good transition.\n\n\nI hope this doesn't come off as insulting to the skins guys, I think ya'll do great work, but you're uncool-ifying one of my favorite champions to play and probably my favorite champion lore-wise here for the sake of visual uniformity in the game's style. In his case in particular I feel you're cheapening the character with such drastic alterations.\n\nHope this counts as helpful feedback.","replies":[{"poster":"Matezoide","date":"2015-01-16T22:46:43.756+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While we are at it, can you guys please finish Mordekaiser's TU?
