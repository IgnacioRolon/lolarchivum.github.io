You better have a Black Cleaver replacement.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":13,"down_votes":14,"body":"For those who haven&#039;t seen what Riot is planning on doing to Black Cleaver, they&#039;re making it into a heavily Fighter-focused item, giving it more hp, less damage, and a phage passive.\nhttp://www.surrenderat20.net/2015/04/47-pbe-update.html\n\nAnd, y&#039;know, that&#039;s fine. I&#039;m sure many fighter champions are desperate for an item with Phage&#039;s effect that isn&#039;t Trinity Force.\n\nBut I swear to god, whoever&#039;s call it was to ***change*** one of ***the only good items for AD Casters***, who ***already have arguably the lamest itemization in the game*** needs to get in here and tell us another item *will* be coming out that fills the *exact same role* that current Black Cleaver does. As in right friggin&#039; now.\n\nHow about you guys decide \"Meh, Zhonyas isn&#039;t really a mage item, it&#039;s more for Tanks\" and give it 30 AP and 100 armor too. I mean while you&#039;re in the mood to significantly alter a key item for an entire class, why not do it to one of the more popular roles too?\n\nBecause if there isn&#039;t a damage-focused Pen/AD/CDR item coming to replace Black Cleaver, and I mean *in the same patch*, that&#039;s all you&#039;re doing, and that needs to not happen.  AD Casters have ONE brutalizer item outside of the jungle item now, and it gives crit chance and attack speed (Youmous), *which should not be AD Caster stats*.\n\nI get it, you like Tanks. You hate Assassins. Lee Sin, Vi, and Rek&#039;Sai will be buffed. So from your perspective this seems all good, because these are Riot's favorite things.\n\nBut if you&#039;re forcibly turning an AD Caster item into a Fighter item, then I *swear to God* you better not whine about bullshit like Bruiser Kha&#039;Zix as you did last season, because ***you are forcing AD Caster players to become Fighters*** with this kind of shortsighted change. Just making you guys aware since long-term consequences have historically not been Riot&#039;s strong point when it comes to balancing changes. \n\nThis will make the Fighters who are already strong, stronger and the AD Casters weaker. It&#039;s going to force AD Casters to end up more like Fighters and you guys are going to be dumbfounded about why all the sudden former-assassins are now building like Bruisers, and then you&#039;re going to nerf the shit out of those supposed-to-be-caster champions into uselessness because that&#039;s how Riot handles the consequences of their own systematic changes: Punish the champions who are forced to be something outside their design vision to stay viable and end up overpowered.\n\nHope all you Zed and Talon players enjoy living through what Kha&#039;zix players had to. Good luck.","replies":[{"poster":"DisasterSola","date":"2015-04-08T05:22:39.006+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"*Ahem*\nLive: \nCost: 3000\n +200 health\n+50 attack damage\n+10% cooldown reduction\nUnique: +10 armor penetration\nPassive \tDealing physical damage to an enemy champion reduces their armor by 5% (25%) for 4 seconds.

The extra 10 ad and flat armor pen is great, and while the 5% extra percentage pen is nice, it has to be stacked with one extra hit (and considering their usual targets and their usual builds + runes, I'm not sure if 5% pen is going to necessarily be better than 10 flat). The health certainly is nice, but an assassin prefers the extra damage, and while sure, Rage is also helpful, ideally an assassin wants to kill a target and get out - not stick to it; that's bruiser territory.\n\nBUT the extra 10% cdr is delicious\n\nedit: I just looked at it on the PBE (wasn't even aware of the change before reading this post), and there's also the whole instead of buying a brutalizer you buy a phage, which is bleh","replies":[]},{"poster":"Phife","date":"2015-04-08T05:25:33.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This ^\n\nI dont get why OP is getting so worked up about a buff to melee champions that can finally build black cleaver....","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"excodar","date":"2015-04-08T06:29:28.691+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Shinjusuke,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2xvHgFIn,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-04-08T05:10:12.996+0000)\n>\n\n> Hope all you Zed and Talon players enjoy living through what Kha&#039;zix players had to.

However, that wouldn't fill the void that Black Cleaver filled for those champions: it was a fair item for both offense and defense. Last Whisper only provides one of those two aspects. It is true that Garen and Darius will both greatly benefit from the change (helping them is justified). However, some champions (ex: Vi and Riven) don't need any help, and the AD casters that are currently not good will be made worse.\n\nThis reminds me of when we lost Atma's Impaler, which I considered almost essential on Garen and core on pre-rework Sion.","replies":[{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2015-04-08T06:54:30.718+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"you have ghost blade and LW.

Having Black Cleaver lose some AD and flat penetration will hit them hard.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
