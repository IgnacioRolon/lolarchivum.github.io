And he *has* broken well over 50% many times in past, and frequently in the upper 50s, and saw no nerfs because Riot wanted to \"wait out\" changes to him. The problem with that is they insist they wanna see diversity and that junglers should have significant strengths and weaknesses specific to jungler playstyles, yet ***adamantly refuse*** to do something about the fact that Lee Sin has *no* jungler weaknesses, and few if any champion weaknesses. *Every other jungler in the game* is apparently this horrendous blight on jungler diversity if they're OP for a *week* (disclaimer: Sejuani has been \"probably too strong\" for much longer than a week, just not \"obviously overpowered\"), yet Lee Sin can single-handedly crowd out a vast amount of jungle picks simply from his sheer versatility and overloaded kit, yet Riot ignores it to prevent pissing off his players.\n\nYou know how I know? Guess which champion is the only one to ever have their rework cancelled because enough of the champion's players whined to Riot about it. They've told ***every other reworked champion's players*** \"too bad, this is happening\", yet Lee Sin is special.

Lee Sin's success and general usefulness goes up the higher up in Leagues you go. Furthermore, the same issue persists regardless of rank: He's *still* the most popular jungler, and nearly the most popular *champion*, throughout all Leagues with the exception of, again massive surges of people abusing the **super** OP thing at the time (in recent history that has only been taken by 420Warwick, and 5.5Sejuani), which means that there's still going to be a pretty heavy skill split. \n\nOn top of this, the Jungle, with very few exceptions, is not a hypercarry role: A snowballing Lee Sin doesn't guarantee a won game. Ultimately a jungler's impact on the game, with a few exceptions, is significantly lessened the longer the game goes on. This **doesn't** mean, however, that Lee Sin is okay. With regards to *jungling*, and within that role and environment, he's *ridiculously* overloaded and outclasses all but the most overpowered thing at the time as an option. There's literally no team where picking Lee Sin is a bad pick, because Lee Sin has no weaknesses as a jungler, and has several very profound strengths (ganking power and invasion, being the most prominent) despite having no weaknesses. As I'm sure anyone can tell you, you can do very well within the scope of your role and still not win the game (as some roles have more \"winning power\" than others), which is not only why all win rates stick *very* close to the 50% mark but also why saying \"durrr low win rate equals balanced champion duh\" is an incredibly ignorant argument, as the amount of variables that factor into it is *vastly* more extensive. The only defense for Lee Sin people seem to have is \"well his win rate is low\", when, if you factor in *any other information available*, it implies a significant design issue and only gets *more* likely to be an indicator of a problem the more information you add in. Win rate in a vacuum is the *only* case where Lee Sin's kit is in an okay spot. \n\nIf you view win rate in a vacuum, that means Urgot was the most OP champion in League for a *long* time recently, as he frequently was up in the 80% range for a while. Which sounds pretty stupid right? Except when it comes to Lee Sin, nearly *every single Lee Sin defender* refuses to *ever* do anything but point to his win rate and call him balanced. I'm pretty sure I don't need to explain why that's both hypocritical and moronic.\n\nAnother common defense of Lee Sin is \"well his kit is overloaded, not overpowered\", which is, in the history of balance discussion, the *dumbest defense to ever be typed into a forum*. What exactly is the argument? \"He's not OP because his kit has too much shit in it\"? Okay, so he can do literally every single thing you want in the jungle role. He does *all* of it well, and lining up his numbers to any other jungler shows a superiority in stats alone. Not to mention, time and time again, he has shown to be a dominating force in the hands of *any* professional jungler who picks him up, regardless of how the game pans out. He might lose the *game*, but he almost *never* loses the *jungle*. So what happens if you streamline his \"overloaded\" kit, but keep the same power level? My guess would be you'd end up with an insanely overpowered kit, as he's already got above-average values across the board, which means if you equally transfer that power into a more refined playstyle (let's say you remove his sustain and dueling and transfer that power into focusing him more on assassination and clear speed) you'll end up with an obscenely strong champion in those regards, because *his overall power level is too high, that's part of having an overloaded kit*. There *isn't* a distinction in his case: He's not *bad* at *anything*, which means his power level across all the aspects he possesses would have to be high enough to be impactful (it is, line up any of his kit with another champion \"defined\" by that kit aspect and see for yourself), which means transferring power from any aspect of his kit to a different aspect would result in that aspect being very much overpowered.\n\nBasically:\nA) Nearly everyone agrees his kit is overloaded\nB) Pretending an overloaded kit isn't going to result in an overpowered kit as a jungler is either outright denial or simple ignorance of what either term means or how the role functions.\nC) The ***only*** time when Lee Sin's low win rate would indicate his balance as resolutely as his defenders would have you believe is when you view it in a vacuum, as *every bit of information* you add to the decision pushes him further toward being poorly designed.","replies":[{"poster":"DemiluniS","date":"2015-03-19T15:04:32.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Caitlyn and vayne got constantly high pick rate in ranked,  must be hella broken and limit the marksmen diversity","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pryotra","date":"2015-03-18T08:41:39.130+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":">Using the argument that there are bad players on a champion to disprove credibility of his win rate is fallacious.\n\n>It's easy to say that when Lee Sin loses a game, that his statistic doesn't count because he was just \"a bad Lee Sin player.\"\n\nThat isn't what he said at all.

Not because every loss is discounted, but rather because there are a large quantity of people spamming the same champion, *regardless of actual skill level with said champion.*\n\n>#Personal Opinion\n\nI personally believe that Lee isn't OP persay, but his kit single handedly warps the jungle and through that the entire game. That is the definition of an unhealthy kit, and as such you see people in the competitive tiers basing their jungle picks off of how well they perform vs Lee Sin. Laners have to form their strategy based off of how to deal with a lee sin gank, including ward locations as well as planned escape routes. The mobility meta is a derivitive of Lee Sin, as champions with great mobility have the tools to escape Lee Sin or at least correct his displacement.\n\nIf that isn't unhealthy for the game, I don't know what is. For the sake of the game, he needs a rework, and until he gets it he needs to be neutered so that the game may thrive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bunies","date":"2015-03-18T21:08:43.754+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BestAnnieUganda,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yy02Lb9d,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-03-18T05:36:10.161+0000)\n>\n> Using the argument that there are bad players on a champion to disprove credibility of his win rate is fallacious. \n> \n> It's easy to say that when Lee Sin loses a game, that his statistic doesn't count because he was just \"a bad Lee Sin player.\"\n> \n> Which losses count, and which ones don't?\n> \n> My thought is that if Lee Sin were strong enough to be pushing 55-60% win rate consistently, he would be.

At least, not the smart ones.   Lee Sin needs a REWORK.  His kit is so strong and full of utility, mobility and buffs/debuffs that he'll always be better than most of his peers in the jungle unless they are VERY decidedly stronger than him in raw stats.  He has no real weaknesses and he had an answer for every situation.  He can exploit the weakness of every jungler who has one.  Do they have a weak clear?  He's great at invades and counter-jungling.  Are they slow?  He's ganked three lanes before they've managed to hit one.  Are they good at invading?  He's a powerful duelist who can escape the few situations he's outmatched in.  He can be strong on every team, vs every other jungler, in every situation.  \n\nUnless they nerf his numbers into the GROUND, he will always be a better pick than other junglers who can do one or two of the things he can do, but lack his options and utility.  The main thing keeping his winrate low is that he's spammed by a lot of people who are frankly... rather bad with him.  He's one of the most popular champs in the game, after all... and has a pretty high skillcap.  Nerfing him into uselessness numerically would just make him abandoned by everyone.  The solution is to rework him and remove some of the things that make him good in EVERY situation, perhaps while giving him a stronger focus in one or two areas to compensate.  But they've been avoiding doing that due to his popularity.  Instead, they're making more and more and more champs designed AROUND people like Lee Sin and his insane mobility and utility.  They seem to have decided the answer is just to overload every champ with crazy kits like his.

It wasn't perfect, but at least you picked champions to accomplish specific jungler goals back then. Shyvana, for example, was *the* clear speed jungler, but she traded less-than-stellar ganks (even post-6) to be so. Mundo was very safe in his own jungle and had strong \"relentless\" ganking power, but less-than-stellar clear speed and was pretty vulnerable to counter-ganks.\n\nLee Sin (and Sejuani at the moment) has no such \"distinct strengths and weaknesses\". You can pick Lee Sin into any team and for any reason, and he'll perform admirably as a jungler. I don't much like either of them, but I'd welcome going back to the Shyvana/Mundo days where the jungle had champions with specific draws and drawbacks rather than stick around where *most* of the junglers have significant strengths and weaknesses but 2-4 are good at *everything* a jungler needs and invalidate most of the other options.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-03-18T02:26:09.039+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":7,"body":"Really don't understand how people can legit say sej does not need nerfs.\n\nLike, I understand Lee Sin's favoritism is really stupid, but the nerfs arent even that bad...","replies":[{"poster":"Shinjusuke","date":"2015-03-18T06:37:04.698+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":6,"body":"Nobody is saying Sejuani doesn't need nerfs.\n\nThe reading comprehension of the community seems to be lackluster at best, sometimes..","replies":[]}]}]}
