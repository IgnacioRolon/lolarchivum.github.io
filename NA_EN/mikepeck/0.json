They also did nerf his AS steroid on his passive, however it never did much for him anyway(You won't even notice this honestly). The arm time on his mushrooms was increased by a half second, which isn't to big a deal. However one huge thing you overlooked.... Teemo's stealth was reduced to activate in 1.5s from 2.0. When in the brush he stealths in 0.75s, and he can now MOVE through the brush while in stealth. Meaning if he goes into bushes he isn't getting caught! This is actually an interesting change for him... one of his biggest weaknesses is actually that he gets camped alot. Not to mention the ability to throw mushrooms can be a pretty big deal, and it has 900 unit range at rank 3(300/600/900 range from 230). He can also bounce them of each other like Gnar increasing their range!

It solves the problem of taking away his incredibly oppressive laning since he won't have nearly as much close range safety, while simultaneously  making his zoning much stronger. \n\nAs for his kiting, it'll take a bit more thinking of where to place the shroom, but he'll be just fine, I think. I think the core idea here was to get him out of the late game position of a shroom-bot and make him more useful in teamfights; he gets more rewards for saving some mushroom and lobbing them into the enemy rather than simply placing them all over top lane bushes and jungle camps. The five minutes also won't be that noticeable honestly.

Teemo cannot win duels with the majority of junglers (but please feed me more {{champion:35}} ). His only safety in lane is his shroom slow, which is not guaranteed because of the luck factor. Skillful placement can increase the odds of surviving a gank, but a good jungler might predict your placement, and a bad jungler could just as easily charge right down the river and not bother checking the bush for wards.  The point is that his gank safety is unreliable, now it's unreliable and ineffective. This is a problem for a champ in a mobility meta where caught = killed.\n\n2) The increased arming time on R makes on-the-fly self peel unrealistic. If you do manage it, it's less effective. This is a problem that will make Teemo top far less viable against matchups that are already skill tests ({{champion:92}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:58}} ). Even some easy lanes could become tougher lanes ( {{champion:36}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:86}} ). This will be especially brutal against {{champion:64}} {{champion:98}} since you need multiple shrooms to peel them if you're ever going to survive the gap closers.\n\nEven relative to other top laners, it's weird to nerf Teemo's slow considering how many oppressive slows and CCs come out of top lane. {{champion:31}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:10}} are just a few examples of slows that are larger, stronger, more reliable, and/or less costly than shrooming, all on champs that are vastly more durable or mobile with dashes, invulnerability, heals, shields, etc. It just really doesn't make any sense to hit the slow of all things, especially when they don't even stack anymore.\n\n2) Teemo's mana bar is frustrating. R is extremely expensive, Q poke gets expensive. But Teemo has very poor synergy with most mana and regen items because he's not optimized for the CDR and spell effects to be worth their budget. \n\nOn a squishy champ who is fairly immobile by current standards, it doesn't make a lot of sense to have him mana-limited in any event. When you have to base frequently to heal, it's super irritating to also have to base even when you're doing very well and not taking any damage. With the mushroom nerfs to duration, arm time, and slow, there's no real reason for Teemo to be out of mana at level 7 after using his ulti and 2 Qs. Not to mention that his mana problems get worse as the game progresses whereas every other champ's mana can be solved through appropriate items.\n\nI think you could kill all birds with one stone by allowing E to apply spell effects exactly like Cho's vorpal spikes (p.s. nerf Cho). Or to give it an active that shoots an AA off timer that applies spell effects. Or to give it better scaling and functionality like Righteous Fury that makes CDR more attractive.\n\nIt would allow a new kind of AP bruiser build, compensate for being the new #1 gank target in LoL, and open up more viable hybrid options that could include some of the following items that are currently useless:  {{item:3174}} {{item:3146}} {{item:3040}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3152}}  along with {{item:3151}} damage being persistent the way it is on every other champ that has Liandry's in their core.\n\nI like that you are making a few QoL changes here, but this is actually a pretty substantial survivability nerf for laning. I think the changes will push Teemo into mid and bot lane more (and possibly even jg since thrown shrooms could initiate good ganks), since his primary viability as a top laner was his ability to not need jg babysitting in most matchups.\n\nGiving E some functionality to proc spell effects would compensate for the R safety nerfs based on build without having to totally gimp your damage. Kiting with {{item:3116}} instead of having to use {{item:3022}}. Mana sustain and a shield from {{item:3040}}. Some actual hp sustain from {{item:3146}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3152}}  instead of having the highest hp potion tax in the game and no way of surviving or peeling all-in top-laners. \n\nJust some thoughts. Hope they are considered. I'm excited about new tricks, but please remember that Teemo's gank safety and map control come at the high cost of his super-short marksman range, relatively low mobility, very low health, and very unreliable utility.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RottedApples","date":"2015-07-24T07:30:45.474+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"as a teemo player i am unsure how i feel about this. \nI like the extra range for shrooms and the fact i can use them as a poke/harass tool.\nThe arm time isn't a huge nerf but it could screw me in fights when i try to lay a shroom down on myself before i die or something, but i probably won't notice it in most situations. i think i'm overeacting to it a bit.\nThe duration nerf kinda sucks it will be harder to keep control of areas if i'm also using shrooms to fight and waveclear. My biggest problem with the duration nerf is that you encourage me to use shrooms to poke and be aggressive thanks to the range and the bounce and then punish me when i decide to use them to gain control of various areas on the map. It's like, i have less to put around the map because i use them aggressively and when i do put them around the map they don't give as much value.\nThe camo changes are really nice especially considering how i like to play teemo. I go for nashors early if i'm ap and if i'm ad i get botrk, sometimes wits end, etc. The late game attack speed buff is great for sneaky plays.\n\nTLDR: I like the camo buffs\nThe arm time nerf worries me but probably won't be a big deal.\nThe duration has me concerned.\nI think once i get used to the changes they will be for the better. I think the camo buffs may outweigh the other changes.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Wav3Break","date":"2015-07-24T07:56:25.468+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think part of you feeling unsure is in some ways a healthy thing. His decision making around his ultimate used to be comparatively more simple, but now that you have all these options I think that exploration is definitely required for you to master his new capabilities. \n\nUltimately there will be many more optimal ways to play him in every game now depending on every scenario. Experiencing failure in your quest to discover/master these new optimizations is inevitable but it is a path that I think will lead to more satisfaction when playing Teemo and becoming one with Satan himself.\n\nLastly, I've said this in other places, but these ultimate changes should open up a lot of space for us to tune more skill based parts of his kit in the future so fear not, the Swift Scout can and will find new ways to torment his victims.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Marthian","date":"2015-07-23T21:28:35.748+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"So far looks like they fixed nothing of why teemo is so toxic to play against (Click Blind that's barely visible, invisible traps.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"sp441","date":"2015-07-23T21:30:16.725+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"HIT THE DECK!
