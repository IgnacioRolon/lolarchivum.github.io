The drop in ping doesnt mean jack shit, however, since the people in my games (including myself) have been receiving unplayable ping spikes the past week. You would think the company running one of the most played games in the world would try and fix things as important as this. Thank you if you are taking the time to read this, and let me add that I am shocked that you actually care enough to read it, because your actions show otherwise.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe people tired of losing games they are winning due to your teammates and/or yourself getting ping spikes of 900","replies":[{"poster":"Camouflaged","date":"2015-09-30T01:21:52.696+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"900 ping spikes? try 3k-7k ping spikes for the past 3 days i can't even play a match for more than 5 mins i go to lane BOOM lag i can't move and i die gg riot for the biggest esports game you'd think they'd fix the lag but naw they'd rather make shitty skins or shitty champs because all they care about is money.  They brought out new icons and brought back skins and we are lagging like hell but all they care about is skins and icons","replies":[{"poster":"tocksiick","date":"2015-09-30T02:31:30.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you, someone else fucking agrees. It is a clear problem that they are ignoring, there have been multiple threads complaining about this exact problem. Mind you these threads are nearing a week or even older, and still no fix.","replies":[]}]}]}
