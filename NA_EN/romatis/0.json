Yeah, the accounts using it will very likely be banned...eventually. I've spectated (and reported via a support ticket) somebody who's risen from ~low silver to mid plat already w/ 100% win rate despite going 0/10 the first 15+ min of the game. There's a few game-breaking issues with the current approach of finding and banning people after the fact:\n\n1) The damage is already done. People's MMR and rankings have already been affected. How will this be addressed?\n2) The damage is furthered because it creates a horrible atmosphere being unable to win despite being far stronger and skilled due completely to one player that absolutely can't be touched. It's no longer a team game in a match with somebody using this exploit.\n3) What is going to happen with people who queued with abusers? They're just as guilty. Otherwise, why not take a smurf account and just carry them to plat/diamond/master before having the abusing account banned?\n4) What about ranked teams? Should the whole team be banned as well?\n\nOverall, there is a known issue that completely breaks the fundamental goal of the game and the response so far of addressing it via bans later (and hiding discussions about the bug) isn't a good option.\n\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Touchtheground","date":"2014-11-14T22:11:00.858+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"How are you going to heal the damage that has already been done, ive lost promos because of these people and i dont think that is fair.","replies":[]},{"poster":"fwa1","date":"2014-11-15T00:01:48.461+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"they arent even banning these jokers with any sense of urgency.

So in the end riot should let these people play again, just Perma ban any account that has benefited through exploiting or duoing with one who is.

An IP ban is a bother and games with swift ban hammers for example Halo 3 back in the day who had strict rules and strong hammers didn't have constant complaints put in about people cheating,being overly toxic, or otherwise. Riot is incredibly kind to its community and I love them for that and the game they made but a lot of people in the community do not deserve to play the game..They ruin the fun of climbing ladders or even the simplicity of enjoying a normal blind pick game. So again IP bans as much as they can screw over people they also solve a lot of problems.\n\nI do wish Riot could give out loss prevented or at least assure us we will not see these people again because like many others that are pointing this out I to have seen the very same people who used the exploit still in game playing.
