A mid laner  has pushed a lane. And they think its more viable to farm up, in doing so they take a junglers wolves. Is this against the rules?\n\nP.S im a jungler main so im used to farming jungle, but just want to know if a laner is ever allowed to take jungle camps on purpose ( not as a troll but thinking it as  a more viable option)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-28T01:35:56.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm gonna side with DeathBurs7 on this one tbh. If their intent is good, then I would say that grabbing some quick farm **without** disrupting the jungler then it should be fine. I would always suggest you take the time to try and educate the person first, but if it does turn out they're being malicious then feel free to report.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-09-28T01:30:43.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, this is totally allowed, and even a good move in most circumstances.\n\nIf you're just at Blue and ready to move on wolves that's a bit of a jerk move, but most of the time laners do that when you're on the other side of the map. It should've respawned by the time you're available to do it.\n\nBut even it it hasn't, the worst thing you can hold against it is that it's a bit selfish, but it's clearly not a bad idea, a sign of trolling, or reportable in any way.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
