(Haven't gotten any in months)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've played the game for a long time now and i really enjoy the Hextech crafting system. This being said, semi-recently (around 6 months) I haven't been getting any key fragments whatsoever. I've done well in games, played champions that i own and still, absolutely nothing. I went away for a couple months when this initially happened and when i came back after not playing for a while, i got around 4-5 key fragments one after another in each game. Now that i am playing consistently again i haven't been getting any, for like 2 months again. I'd really like some way if you could fix this, because i don't think this is supposed to happen. Thank you! {{champion:115}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-24T22:57:29.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The droprate for key fragments is more of a curve and less of a line. This means that with every key fragment that drops, the chances of the next one dropping is exponentially lower. This droprate resets approximately 30 days after you received your first key fragment. I recommend you continue to play, and if you don't see key fragments for a few more weeks, hit us up in a [support ticket.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"UseFulMurderer","date":"2016-10-25T00:05:01.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But like, its been months and i dont know why i havent been getting any? I have 6 chests. I've been getting them somewhat frequently but no key fragments? \nEven after thinking back to 30 days ago, i dont see a single one. I've had the one in my inventory thats been sitting by itself for about  2 - 2 1/2 months i feel i should of at least gotten some by now?{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-25T20:40:56.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look at your account and it seems you've earned multiple key fragments towards the beginning of this month.

It's really weird though! My friends have been toxic and have not gotten a key or a chest for maybe a week, but months!? Oh man! That is indeed weird.
