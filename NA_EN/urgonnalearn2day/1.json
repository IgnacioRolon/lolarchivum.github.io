Unfortunately correlation does not mean causation.  Teams that win tend to not cuss because things are going well.  Also typing in LoL is generally stupid in it's own right and can cause a loss.  I'm betting you'll find less typing on winning teams also.  Let's be real people.\r\n\r\n2)  The way Solo Q works is in itself toxic. 1 person can hold 4 other people hostage and there's literally nothing you can do about it.  Yeah if they curse in game or afk you can get them a slap on the wrist, but then they just learn to say nothing in game or move around.  Not only that.... people actually BEG the person not to be a jerk.  This stuff stays with you to the next game.\r\n\r\n3)  We need a way to remove someone in champ select because it would honestly make the game WAY better.  Yet we are worried about that 1 person's feelings..... _that the other 4 people don't want on their team._  Just make it so teams cannot abuse it and we're golden.\r\n\r\n..... ladies and gentlemen you can take it from here:","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2015-09-28T13:56:14.286+0000","up_votes":51,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Aggressive drivers get cut off more often.\" -Riot Games\n\nThat's a better parallel. Because cursing has no effect on your fellow drivers, but being toxic *does* have an effect on fellow teammates.\n\nSo yes, it's true. If I'm on the highway, there are a few random jerks who will cut me off at every chance they get, weaving in and out of lanes so they can make it to work just a little bit faster, and I can't do jack shit about them. But the majority of drivers are NOT like that, except if I repeatedly cut them off, they're more likely to try to stop me or cut me off in return.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2015-09-28T15:35:46.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":20,"body":"I think you missed the point entirely, your cursing because you got hit by traffic. the traffic came first, and you are cursing independent of it and towards it.","replies":[{"poster":"Daen","date":"2015-09-28T15:57:51.083+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not how the logic here works, unfortunately.

A correlation is a number between -1 and 1 that indicates the strength of the relationship between two sets of numerical data. The closer to 0, the weaker the relationship. More positive => a stronger direct relationship (ie, # TVs per household and life expectancy), and more negative => stronger inverse relationship (ie, Frequency of smoking cigarettes and life expectancy). As such, two things that are unrelated still have a correlation, it's just likely near-zero.\n\nThe correct statistical word that people most often mean when they say \"Correlation\" is \"Association,\" which refers to a relationship between two things (ex: Y and Z are *associated.* There is a strong *association* between Y and Z).\n\nIn your particular case I'd probably replace the words \"do not correlate\" with \"have no relationship\" or \"are not associated.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"macromite","date":"2015-09-29T03:40:11.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the thing is, it does correlate, clearly you have not been hit by actually traffic before, like snail pace traffic. you are likely going to be mad, and possibly curse. because you curse while in traffic, it shows that, and it shows that more people curse who are in traffic than out of traffic. this is the idea of the statement, that the cause is the uncontrollable nature of traffic or the game, and that the person in the traffic cursing is not the one who is in charge of the situation, like how in league when you lose it's not always because of you.\n\nwhat he said is instead saying that it is infact that players fault in every situation, that being an aggressive driver is the sole causation, but this is dramatically different from the original post, it is saying that players will make other players mad.\n\nthe secret is of course in the wording, the op suggests that there are unwinnable matches \"traffic\" and cursing is the toxicity that this causes, which makes perfect sense.\n\nthe post that I had originally replied to suggests that players are main factor, you can only be mad if someone makes you mad, and in turn you will make others mad. this also makes sense, but it is not the same or even just a rewording of the post.","replies":[{"poster":"Jubbinaut","date":"2015-09-29T04:24:05.491+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=macromite,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=YamP5QUl,comment-id=0004000000000001,timestamp=2015-09-29T03:40:11.361+0000)\n>\n> the thing is, it does correlate, clearly you have not been hit by actually traffic before, like snail pace traffic. you are likely going to be mad, and possibly curse. because you curse while in traffic, it shows that, and it shows that more people curse who are in traffic than out of traffic. this is the idea of the statement, that the cause is the uncontrollable nature of traffic or the game, and that the person in the traffic cursing is not the one who is in charge of the situation, like how in league when you lose it's not always because of you.\n\nThe difference, though, is that Riot's statement is intended as a two-way correlation. Both things are capable of affecting the other. It doesn't state a causative relationship, because the fact of the matter is that it's fairly complex - it's true that losing games can cause players to become toxic (when they otherwise wouldn't be), but it's *also* true that being toxic can cause players to lose games (that they might otherwise have won).\n\nIn the case of the OP's example, however, it only goes one way - there's no conceivable way for cursing in your car to influence traffic.\n\n> what he said is instead saying that it is infact that players fault in every situation, that being an aggressive driver is the sole causation, but this is dramatically different from the original post, it is saying that players will make other players mad.\n\nHe didn't state that it was the sole causation. In fact, he clearly indicated otherwise, saying, \"*If I'm on the highway, there are a few random jerks who will cut me off at every chance they get [...] and I can't do jack shit about them*.\" Rather, he strongly implies that the relationship between the two was complex, much like the relationship between toxicity and win/loss.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2015-09-29T06:01:59.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot does not present it as a two way interaction, instead the wording implies that you can win a completely lost game with nothing more than not using the chat function to yell at your team in a percentage of games, when this is not the case.\n\nCursing can't cause traffic in most cases, but it is a very accurate way to describe at least one instance of this problem, you are making an assumption that this is meant as a general quote, when it really just describes one specific scenario that the general quote does not accurately suggest under its wording, therefore making the general quote easily misunderstood and rather pointless to have in the game\n\nNo, he is in fact saying the only causation is aggravated drivers. read your own statement and think, why would someone cut someone off randomly?

It does not indicate whether the losses cause toxicity or the toxicity causes losses - but it **does** indicate that there is a connection between the two.\n\nAny connection worth mentioning so blankly (that is, without clarifying language) **must** be a two-way connection.

I'm not saying his point is wrong, I'm saying its different and irrelevant to the discussion.\n\nPeople tend not to *actively* and *intentionally* harm others, sure. But there's plenty of possible explanations for someone to do so without the *intention* of harm.\n\nEven then, there's a significant disconnect in both situations - and people who don't recognize others as people tend not to *treat* them like people. Which goes a long way towards explaining the dozens of over-aggressive drivers I see every day, regardless of what I'm doing.\n\n> On another note I can think of three incredibly roundabout ways that cursing can cause traffic, but that's not important.\n\nI would love to know how it's possible for traffic (whether seen as a system or as intentional choices by others) could *possibly* be caused by someone sitting in their car and cursing about it - an action that, presumably, those others would be effectively unaware of.\n\nEDIT: It occurs to me that this last paragraph in particular might seem rather confrontational.

You have one of two issues:\n\n Issue 1, you punish players who are trying to be helpful to their team. A while back I stopped playing ADC because I'm bad at it and I don't like the role enough to practice it to improve to the level I play at in ranked so it became something that being willing to play was damaging my climb. I tell my team every game that I can play every role except for ADC and I almost never have an issue. If no one on the team has interest in playing adc (usually someone asks for it though) then I'll offer to play heimer bot lane if someone can go physical damage in another lane, bc heimer gives the push ability that an AD would so if we can early baron (easier w/ heimer than most comps) then we can push hard mid game and win before their ADC out scales me. It's not the best pick but I have a decent win rate when I've had to do it and probably a 100% better chance to win a game w/ it than if I play ADC against an ADC main at my rank, and if I'm not in promos I usually just dodge. I'm not trolling but a lot of people freak out about it and given that I really try not to force my team to play such an odd comp unless I absolutely have to, I think it would be pretty painful if a vote kick lost me promos when I was trying to do something good for my team and not cause an auto loss playing a traditional ADC bot lane.\n\nIssue 2, if you don't punish people harshly enough for being vote kicked (which the punishment is what causes issue 1) then you end up with the issue of people trying to abuse the vote kick by trying to get kicked. Even if there is a chance to have to play a really stupid champ+role combo, many people would risk it and hope that at least one of the 4 people (or all if it had to count against all) would vote to kick them so they didn't have to play the role they didn't want to. \n\nIt is hard to remove one of those issues w/out creating the other. Also personally it feels kind of awesome to win something w/ a player who plays something so off the wall that none of us think it will work but they ask us to trust them bc they swear they aren't trolling. When they come through and you're just like, how did you just make that work?!?! it's pretty awesome.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Daen","date":"2015-09-28T18:55:40.268+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Also typing in LoL is generally stupid in it's own right and can cause a loss.

Your behavior will impact your allies, and while everyone responds differently, most people do not respond positively to a teammate screaming at them for sucking.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, League is a team game and as such working with others is something that is a necessary part of that experience. Sometimes you are going to get relatively poor teammates that you have to make up for, sometimes you are going to have great teammates that carry the game, and sometimes you will be the teammate in either the first or second example. It all happens.\n\nYou can only account for yourself in these scenarios and what is important to remember if you care about winning (and most people do) is that the best chance you have of success is when your team is playing at their individual best. And because your actions can and do influence the behavior of your teammates you can choose to be a positive force that keeps morale up and stops people from going on tilt and try to stay in the game for a chance to snag victory, or you can be a negative force that makes your team haggard and wary and likely to give in at the first sign the scales are tipping.\n\nWhat I am getting at here is there is only one person you can depend on to improve the cohesion and play of your team and unsurprisingly that person is you. Could the system be better? Absolutely there is always room for improvement.

When one person is being a jerk(let's assume cursing means in a rude demaning way) it fractures team cohesion, and whatever you may believe League is a VERY team focused game and if the team isn't working together they'll lose pretty quickly.\n2. Being rude and aggressive puts people on tilt much more quickly, so losing lanes will lose harder\n3. Generally at the point a player loses their calm they begin to give up on the game. Especially in lower elo this means they don't look for way to come back in the game and don't take advantage of throws the opposing team does.\n\nWhile players who don't cuss may still experience these problems a negative/rude teammate just makes all of them worse and because of that causes the people in those games to be more likely to lose.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AbyssionKnight","date":"2015-09-29T17:42:12.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The title isn't an accurate representation of Riots Stance. \"People who curse while driving get into more Accidents\" is a more accurate representation of Riots opinion, and is factually sound. A high emotion driver is going to be more aggressive while driving. That means more risks, and hitting the gas / brake harder. More aggressive driving does increase your odds of getting into an accident because aggressive driving is often unsafe.\n\nThe same applies to the game. An angry player is more likely to lose the game, because they are letting their emotions get the better of them. They're willing to make more risky plays, usually pay less attention to the map, and in their frustration either go too deep into a team fight (hitting the gas hard) or have no faith in their team and pull out early (hitting the brake hard). Overly emotional playstyles tend to result in more losses because your emotions tend to prevent you from being as tactical as someone with a cool head.\n\nOf course that's not an absolute, and some players can be completely toxic or constantly angry and still win / play to the best of their abilities.
