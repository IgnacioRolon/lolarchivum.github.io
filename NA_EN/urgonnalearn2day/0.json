The forum is not necessarily representative of the whole community. Most people never visit the forums, and most of those that do don't even contribute to them much; Toxic players are a minority, they're just really loud about it. People that are content about their situation don't tend to go making a big deal over it.\n\nB. If you really read the threads about people being banned, there are a lot of people that actually try to explain to them how the system works and what they did wrong. They turn against that person typically only when the person decides that he has done nothing wrong and starts insulting everyone (though sometimes they start right in the OP).\n\nC. What? Maybe they ignore some ideas because it'll lead to negative behavior, but allowing games to end without penalty because of DC/AFK is actually something they consider. I'll even cite my source for that;\nhttps://ask.fm/RiotLyte/answers/132562353346\n\nTL;DR - You're right that people need to be more positive and sportsmanlike, but the majority of the community is neutral or positive, not negative.

The forums ARE representative of the community. Once you get past the complaint threads from people who came straight from a game in which they lost to 'X' champion, you get to the regular forum goers (i.e. forum goers who frequent the forums). These people are what you can consider a sample of the community. Some are low rank, some are high rank, everyone mains different champions and roles. It is representative of the community as a whole.\n\nThe issue, though, is that Riot just views people who frequent the forums as being a whole different subsection of the community and not as representatives of Platinum-level players, or AD Carry mains, or seasoned veterans who have been playing LoL since the early days. Riot sees us as a vocal minority whose 1000 word threads about the state of certain items, champions or metas are done for our own leisure. No, it's done because we care about the game and its community and because we feel we have more in-depth knowledge than Riot does.\n\nThis is why 1000 game Mordekaiser mains were all but completely ignored when they ruined him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Slumber Jack","date":"2015-12-18T21:36:00.473+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm on a plane right now, but I'll drop in real quick (ish) to give some insight.\n\n**A.)** Our forums, and other sites like Reddit, are a passionate and vocal bunch but are not representative of how the greater community acts/thinks. Can't determine the health of the entire community based off a small data set.\n\n**B.)** I can understand why this might come up; we've created a place on these forums that are specifically meant for players to talk about their punishments and for others to review/discuss it with them. This is intended; most of our player base understands what is normal/acceptable behaviour and can shine light on what might be a confusing situation to a punished player.\n\nOf course, having a solid understanding of what is normal can also mean a player might look at a punished player and say \"...really, dude?\". It can be difficult to empathise with a punished player.\n\n**C.)** I mentioned this in the point above, an overwhelming majority of our players have a very good understanding of what is acceptable/good behaviour and have never been punished. Of the players who have? Almost all of them reform and are perfectly fine afterwards.\n\nAlso, we're exploring the idea of surrendering early in certain situations, but we're still prioritising new champ select at this exact moment.

These folks can single handedly win games by themselves.  They make a living playing the game and interact with each other in the same manner.  They're friends and game partners.  If they go to events, they play against each other in these events.  \n\nYour average League player is not in that group.  They don't go to events let alone play in them for money.  They're not pros; they may not be very good.  But they also have anonymity.  In the grand scheme of things, you may only see them a few times.  No one knows their name and probably no one cares.  No one is seeking them out for recruitment.  There are many other factors.  But I've made my point.  The people you associated with at the event are not the same as the rest who play this game.\n\nMY point is that the pros are not your average player.  They don't know each other.  Most players don't know anyone else on their screen from Adam.  Someone else screws up and they suffer, it's easy to place blame and dislike that person.  And the anonymity of the internet makes it easy to retaliate on.  That is a lot of your playerbase.\n\nOh, yes!  You have met and interacted with a very cool segment of players in the game.  But it's merely a small part of the whole and not representive (sp?) of that whole.  Something to aspire to, yes.  The negative aspects often stand out more than any positives hence the reputation the game has.  It's not a good thing to have at all.  But there it is.\n\nI wish I could be less, well, negative about it all myself.  But it's foolish to look at just one side of things.  You miss the whole picture.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Whiskies","date":"2015-12-19T06:06:20.572+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ooooo miscommunication here, sorry that I wasn't being more clear!\n\nTo me, \"players\" means _us_, the average player.

Since chat is non-essential to winning in league (since you can communicate all the essential things through pings) why is there even chat in this game instead of a system of automated messages?](https://m.ask.fm/RiotLyte/answers/133551494594)\n> \n> This is actually a great question.\n> \n> We agree, chat COULD be non-essential, and we could start building the systems and tools to completely replace chat, such as the feature you mentioned of putting in short-cuts to automate messages, or systems like the \"chat\" system in Hearthstone. _**However, our design philosophy is to not completely remove a feature just because there is a potential for toxicity--we always assess the pros and cons, and try to see if we can figure out a design that is net positive.**_ For example, although there is far less verbal toxicity in a game of Hearthstone, there's also less meaningful interactions and dialogue. In some games that remove chat, it's even hard to tell whether you are playing versus an AI or a human and that makes a difference in your connection with the game. It's nearly impossible to get to know someone without being able to express yourself organically through conversation, and if that's impossible, it's really hard to make friends. We were just reviewing data today that a majority of players have made a real, online friend in League and play with them a decent number of games a month--that's awesome. We think there is huge value in chat and some of our best experiences are those matches where you're chatting it up in games and become friends after.\n> \n> To us, that positive experience is so valuable that it was worth trying features like Chat Restrictions and All-Chat Filters to try to reduce the negativity of chat, while still keeping the benefits.\n\nEmphasis in the above quote is mine - the key sentence felt lost in that giant paragraph.\n\n> ##[Have you ever thought about making an automatic loss forgive mechanic for games where someone DC's for most of the game/the entire game or never connected?](https://ask.fm/RiotLyte/answers/134399851970)\n> \n> We have a few changes we'd like to make to the Surrender System in 2016, including a mechanic that allows players to reset the game with no penalties (except for the player that DC'd) if a player fails to connect to the match.
