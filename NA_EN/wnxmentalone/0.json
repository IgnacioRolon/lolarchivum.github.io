According to diagnostics and google this should be more than enough to run LoL, it supports shader 5.0 and my DirectX is version 10. However when I load into a game it immediately crashes my computer. On howling abyss in game timer gets to one second on SR doesn't even last that long. I went through the wrenchmen's tools and reduced my graphics settings to bare minimum but no change. I'm guessing something with my computer is still set from when I was using my AMD graphics card but I didn't have any custom settings for league and I already reduced my graphics settings to minimum with the wrenchmen's tool thing. Any ideas as to what I could do to get the game to run since I should more than meet the minimum requirements? Or will I just have to wait until I get a new graphics card?
