If people are only on PB to laugh at those who have received punishment, then those people should find another outlet for their schadenfreude. The boards to not exist for people to mock or laugh at others.","replies":[{"poster":"Inkling Commando","date":"2018-12-10T20:34:40.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well that is what i see when i see a topic discussing it. the topic is downvoted to hell and back and a bunch of comments saying they deserved it and what not. i never see a comment (that is not a mod) that actually cares about the person being banned.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-12-10T03:48:18.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ones where they start out argumentative and insisting that their behavior was fine and Riot's rules are wrong, sure. But a small percentage of banned player threads are actually refreshingly self-reflective and thoughtful.

Having been permabanned before: You're in this weird state of not wanting to play/being angry/wanting to jump back in and prove you're better.

There's no excuse for it, just explaining the reasoning behind it. It always helps to lend a helping hand to someone who's already down.","replies":[]}]}
