Poppy wears a Shark hat and pirate outfit with her hammer being a Hammer Head Shark. her shield is a Sea Shell. Q is a splash of water going down then the water coming up again. W is a wall of a water surrounds her with bubbles and sea life. E is the same (unless someone can think of something) Ult is a spike of coral shoots upwards knocking the enemies away. recall animation her hammer comes to life and she hops aboard it as it dives under water.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2019-10-15T22:21:59.144+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Love it!

A sea shell is just so fragile and brittle... it may look beautiful in-game but doesn't really sell the idea of this stoic defensive tool she can throw around and pick back up.","replies":[{"poster":"Inkling Commando","date":"2019-10-16T04:28:55.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Lutzburg,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=ge3YFdwE,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2019-10-16T03:50:47.101+0000)\n>\n> In that case I'd suggest a turtle shell, perhaps?
