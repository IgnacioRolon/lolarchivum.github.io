I mean If I copy kayn and I am not going through a wall obviously its Neeko and not Kayn. I am glad they did it this way, because it could be so stupidly overpowered if it was too hard to guess who was Neeko.\n\nplus if she is copying an ADC and she takes 20 AA's to kill a minion probably Neeko lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2019-01-11T17:58:25.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is actually a whole [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlvPsAISSqM&t=102s) on neekos inconsistencies!","replies":[]}]}
