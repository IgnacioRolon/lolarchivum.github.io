After underclocking my gpu however, from 1.2 ghz to 300 mhz and the memory from 1.5 ghz to 150 mhz and still got identical fps. This leads me to think that the game is extremely cpu bound. I heard league only used 2 cores, which would mean that a pentium or celeron from 2011 would essentially push this game to the limit which I think would be kind of funny. When I say the limit, I don&#039;t mean maxed out graphics, rather I mean the highest possible fps. \n\nSo I guess another way to word this question is does anyone get over 500 fps at 1080p?","replies":[]}
