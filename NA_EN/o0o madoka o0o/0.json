As someone who's mained jungle since I learned what it was 3+ years ago, I'm HEAVILY against Lee Sin buffs. Giving the ridiculously strong, low-level power, invading gank jungler more vision passively in FoW and an extra ward, plus more W jumping? That's just not going to be okay.\n\n3) Some of you will say \"PSSH NOBODY BUYS SIGHTSTONE ON LEE SIN\", or \"Dude you're being paranoid\", I *promise* you if you make sightstone a remotely viable health item, or even just an item worthwile on things besides supports, ***the pro teams will start buying it***. They will. I promise. Vision is arguably the most powerful but most underrated control of the game you can get. If your tankish jungler can buy an item that gives more defenses and more vision/warding, particularly if they can jump to wards (*cough cough*), they're gonna get it in pro teams.\n\n4) Too many stats on it and anyone who can itemize defenses might get it, and Jungling is in piss-poor state as-is for ganking. Too much vision, too much of a push for tank jungles from Riot, too much nerfing of assassins (some of which who have to still jungle, guys), etc. More vision on that top lane Nasus you're trying to gank is just not good, and passive gameplay when they game already currently favors late-game playstyles is not what we really need right now.\n\n\nIf you're going to give it cool effects, I don't think under any circumstances you should give it more stats. If it's going to be bought, it needs to be bought PURELY for the vision benefits. No more defenses, no move speed, no cdr, no Gp/10, nothing. Any of those things can be used on other roles/lanes besides supports and if it becomes viable as anything more than a vision item it's going to cause a lot of issues.\n\nAgain, sorry to sound like I hate the idea, I don't, I'd love to make Sightstone better, I'm saying the state of the game can't take it right now.

Jungle items have the gate of \"X affects only monsters\" which allows it to be jungler-only, but sightstone has no such gate.\n\n***About how the item's unintended effects***\n---------\n\nThe problem you encounter is that if you give bonus vision to sightstone, it's not just supports who will be using it, the Junglers who can itemize it and the Mids (not many, maybe like Swain), and the tops (Much more than mid) who want extra vision without risky ward placement will buy it too, because defenses are universally helpful and if Sightstone gave any more, it might be gold efficient out of sheer hp gain.  That's why Feral Flare has such a huge ward place range, it's incredibly strong to have safe warding power in the jungle.\n\nHave to bring up ganking again, as atm it's in a piss-poor spot with the free warding already + permanent wards through pinks if used correctly.

But that would ruin other roles and be insanely frustrating to the people who it'd cause problems for, just like Sighstone buffs would be for the people who have to actively monitor all the wards in the entire game to be successful.\n\nIt's just not an item buff that can be justified without equally powerful ward removal tools.\n\nPerhaps if the buffs were gated by the \"diamond\" sightstone being very costly (meaning Legendary/Mythical tier, so 3k+ **minimum**) , or the effects gated by champion level, it'd be okay, because then it'd be locked to the late midgame or early lategame at the earliest.

Riot wants vision to be a team effort. Sightstone is a cheap pickup that, really, anybody could buy, but supports often end up buying it because they generally don't scale as hard with gold, other lanes have more uses for the item slot and extra gold. \n\nIf we increase the green ward limit by one on ruby sightstone, not only does it force supports to go for it (as we need vision, and they already have the sightstone), it would require us to even stock up on an extra green ward or two, to keep up with having four wards down at once, plus all the scanning that goes on. Sightstone is meant to be an item which puts an end to ward buying. If you own a sightstone, you should not need to buy another green ward that game. Having a four ward limit late game, and trying to keep up with making use of that extra limit means we have to buy at least one or two extra green wards - this is bad.\n\nIf you're talking about increasing the pink ward limit, it would be a kind of niche upgrade (if they have lots of stealth then it might be useful), but again, it's forcing supports to make use of that two ward limit. Pink wards are fairly expensive, and if we choose to invest another 475g into a pink trinket to make use of the extra limit, we're sacrificing scanning for wards every minute. It would leave a hefty hole in the support's not-so-deep pockets.\n\n\nOne minor buff to a ruby sightstone is something I wouldn't mind seeing - assuming it doesn't become a mandatory rush. I'd love to see an upgrade that becomes more relevant late game, so you purchase the sightstone early game, and upgrade it again at 30+ minutes.\n\nBecause of how quickly wards can be killed late game (it's pretty hard to even put one down as an ADC can even kill it before it stealths), I propose this ruby sightstone buff.\n\n\nUNIQUE passive: Ward Reinforcement - Wards dispensed by the ruby sightstone require six (rather than three) hits to be destroyed.\n\n\nThis helps give a ward a fighting chance when it's put down late game, and actually forces the enemy team to use a pink/scanner to kill the ward. It's also not a super-strong buff, meaning it doesn't make ruby sightstone a force rush, and some people might not ever even pick it up. It does give it a niche for late game, which I think is the perfect little nudge it needs.\n\n\nEdit: Quick concern that Riot Baconhawk brought up with having wards at six health, scanning a ward with a tier 2 scanner generally gives a lone support time for five auto attacks. That means that a support with low base AS and no AA Reset (LEONAAAAAA) would not be able to kill a ruby sightstone ward in the time that it was scanned.\n\nTo sort of fix this while also solving another issue, it might be cool if all wards affected by a scanner instantly take one point of damage. As it stands, if a support scans a bush that has two wards, and they lack AS /AA reset, they can only do 5 hits, leaving one ward with one health. This would not only allow the reinforced ward to be killed by base AS in one scan, it would also help the lone support and reward good scan placement.\n\n\nA less intrusive solution would be to have the passive provide a temporary shield, which is removed once the ward is stealthed.","replies":[{"poster":"KevinSanToast","date":"2014-09-12T20:52:24.548+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the direction your suggestion is going.

Once it stealths, the shield goes away. This allows supports with low base AS to clear wards as they do now. But helps give wards the fighting chance they need when placed. \n\nAlternatively, to help boost pink ward play, particularly in the late game, perhaps the Ruby Sightstone's passive allows for pink wards (or just one.

By the time you'd be interested in building it, you've already got 100%+ efficiency out of the regular Sightstone's passive, making the ward dropping portion of the item worthless in regards to gold efficiency. While I can't speak for other players, I know that after I get a normal Sightstone, I start aiming to build my boot item and then a typical support item, and by the time I've finished those I've placed well beyond 6 wards, especially if I'm having a long laning phase.\n\nThe only benefit from Ruby Sightstone would be having the one extra charge when I'm roaming, which feels unnecessary. It feels like, by the time my 3 wards I've placed have vanished, I've either already backed and restocked, or I'm just not in a good position to be roaming and placing wards since I'm likely needed elsewhere. This means that for me to feel it's worth building Ruby Sightstone (aside from finishing my build) is that the one extra ward charge has to be worth a whopping **533g**\n\nI do think that for me to desire Ruby Sightstone as it is now, it needs something. Being able to place one more Stealth Ward could be just the ticket, and/or perhaps even just dropping the cost simply because of how inefficient it feels. The only issue I can see with changing Ruby Sightstone, is that some champions ({{champion:64}}) simply buy it to make themselves more mobile, rather than for the vision. Either way, it could be a fun pre-season experiment :)","replies":[{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2014-09-14T05:02:11.834+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is one flaw in your argument:\n\nThe health of Ruby Sightstone is worth 1067g, leaving 533g.\n\nHowever you also said that the basic passiv already makes up the first 400g from the regular sightstone.\n\nThat leaves only 133g for the ubgraded charge.\n\nPersonally I think it is worth alot.

However, the 1 extra stack and 250 hp is not useful enough to warrant purchase OVER other items.  My concern as support is that, especially now with our utility scaling from AP, 800 gold is a big investment.  It is not about the \"efficiency\" of the gold cost.  It is about whether the item is an efficient buy.  Bloodthirster is very gold efficient too, but that doesnt mean I will be buying it on my supports any time soon.  My argument was about the fact that what you get out of Ruby Sightstone specifically, while being gold efficient, is not ROLE efficient.  Having 1 extra stack is not going to make or break the game.  In fact I find that very rarely do I ever have to use the 5th ward stack before returning to base(unless my team is not warding at all, but that is a completely different issue).\n\nI know what you and everyone else is saying.  The only argument is not just about the gold to benefit ratio.  It is about the benefit to role ratio.  As a support I usually have the fastest movespeed(excluding a few instances) so I can afford to back a few extra times per game.  Meanwhile, I spend my gold on some well deserved AP or other important things.  800 god does not seem like much to any other role since they get farm.  Even with the new support items you still get less gold than everyone else but are expected to buy a ward dispenser(and later upgrade it) for the cost of a vamp scepter(2 with upgrade).  A vamp scepter to an ADC is a small investment, most times I see ADC's buying at least one other item with it, but to a support that is usually all I buy if I get it first trip back.  As to the 800 gold to go from Sightstone to Ruby?  A little more math, Bilgewater Cutlass is only 1400 gold, Sheen = 1200, and a needlessly large rod is the same price... 1600 gold.\n\nSo in closing, I will state it one more time.  Gold efficiency is right on target for the SightStone item tree.  From a role stand point though, 1600 gold is an incredible investment compared to what you COULD be buying.  You can argue that it is the support's job to get sightstone, but then why did Riot rework the whole vision thing to help supports?  Now the only thing I have seen to compensate for this cost, is the increase in mage bot \"supports\".  Even I do this a lot.  Lux, Ziggs, Morgana.  It is all the same.  I see LOTS of AP and no gold income on them.  So how do they get the gold for it?  By getting kills.  Which usually pisses off the markman.  In reality, the issue arises from the idea of a role completely designed to baby some spoiled douche, but no one wants to say it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2014-09-12T23:24:44.536+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I very very rarely even get to the Ruby Sightstone (support main).

Supports have even more trouble reaching a \"true\" full build because of the sightstone taking up room in their inventory.  I have two ideas for a potential solution:\n\n-Remove wards from the store.  Have a \"ward\" key you can press for both types of ward.  If you can afford it, when you press the ward key you'll spend the gold (75/100) and drop down a ward.  The limit of 3/1 wards placed is still in effect, but you no longer have to go to the store to stock up ahead of time.  If you have a sightstone and place a ward, it is free, then the sightstone goes on cool down.  Wards will cost as normal (or perhaps reduced) until the sightstone is off of cool down.  Or maybe it has charges that replenish, or something.\n\nOR,\n\n-Have a slot for stealth wards, and a slot for a vision wards, over by the area where the trinket goes.  If you buy a sightstone, it would fill that slot, giving you benefits but not taking up a spot in your inventory.  The sightstones could have stats like an item, or give a nice passive, or whatever.  If you have keys that you can assign to the task of warding, then the ward slot itself can be reserved for the sightstone to have active ability.  Or just have a green and purple number in your inventory bar somewhere that keeps tracks of how many wards you have to place, and leave sightstone in your inventory if necessary.\n\nYes, these solutions would make for more wards, and therefore junglers would have a harder time.  So make it easier to remove wards as well.  I think \"vision wars\" would be fine as long as everyone can participate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Willidude","date":"2014-09-15T19:37:40.472+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do NOT main support so I do feel like I am posting in a post not intended for me. However, I feel like the sightstone is the most powerful item in the game I try to get it no matter what position I play except for ADC where the support has the area covered. (If my support isn't warding then I buy one anyway)\n\nWe all seem to agree that SOMETHING needs to be done to the ruby sightstone to make it viable as I, like everyone else, don't see the point. I think that an increase in the limit on stealth and vision wards passive would be an amazing upgrade on this item. (Preferably the vision [pink] wards) Having only one allowed has always made purchasing them risky in my opinion. Where if you place it somewhere people usually go you risk it being taken out early. (the obvious and accepted risk) The usually overlooked risk, however, is the one that is taken on when you risk wasting money by buying a second pink ward without your first being gone yet. It is a waste of gold that could be enough to keep you ahead on items in lane.\n\nAdding a second pink ward with the item would not remove this risk, but diminish it a little bit hand help a lot with watching the junglier ganks (specifically helping mid-laners in solo queue who don't know the enemy jungle's tendency's and have to guess which side to keep warded)\n\nThis would make life harder for the jungler. If this update were to take place then I think a cool down reduction would have to be put on the scanner. If the number of wards out there goes up, then the ability to get rid of them (to keep the balance) would have to go up as well.\n\nThis is just my view on the topic trying to look at it from the most affected positions by it. Any added discussions or counter-arguements are accept and welcomed. The fear that people will make the support do all the work is very valid, but cannot be tackled without people understanding that {{item:2049}} is wicked OP when 3 - 4 of the teammates have it.","replies":[]}]}
