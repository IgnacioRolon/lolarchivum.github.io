With all the huge changes the game really needs some reflection and careful/meticulous balance changes. \r\n\r\nWith these new 2 champions it just makes me cringe. I feel like they&#039;re going to be a half-assed sack of shit like what happened with Assassin&#039;s Creed Rogue/Unity. Also, another champ that can go untargetable... FUNNN. They are both so bland. \r\n\r\nYa&#039;ll need to spend more time doing things to perfect them before releasing them/changing something. Take a look at every champion that is in need of nerfs, and every champ that is in need of buffs. Go one by one, changing one variable at a time so there isn&#039;t a ripple effect.","replies":[{"poster":"RenownedWheat42","date":"2017-04-04T19:26:13.792+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"I actually REALLY love the design and kits for these champs.\n\nHow are they bland, exactly?

She has an ammo system, kinda a talon Q build into two abilities, a basic linear skill shots, somewhat similar to Taliyah. To clarify I see where you're coming from, but I think her kit is very cool and seems like a lot of fun, IMO of course. \n\nWhile Rakan seems to have more differences in his abilities but I see his kit as some what simple, I guess is the best way to word it, like basic idea of a shield when moving to a targeted ally, an aoe heal, dash + knock up, its simple stuff. His ult does seem very different and cool, considering ahri was the only one with a charm prior. \n\nLastly I think Riot should focus more on game health and balance but that shouldn't be thrown on the character design teams, as with companies they tend to have multiple groups working on different portions of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"QuickenedBlade","date":"2017-04-04T20:09:08.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cujix,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1zmAN0mq,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-04-04T19:38:17.365+0000)\n>\n> if they&#x27;re anything like rogue and unity, one will be one of the better characters in the game (rogue) and the other will suck (unity)\n>\n\nRogue was a like 8hr game.
