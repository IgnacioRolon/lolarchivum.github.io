But i have this recurring issue where i open the client, i'm presented with a message saying i need install an older version, my only option is click okay. Once i do so, the client immediately prompts me to restart it so it could try and repatch itself. from that point i either open the client and get the first message again or im greeted with this lovely empty patcher box. i cant even log in or click the cogwheel. I've already utilized the hextech repair tool and got all the logs saved. i tried submitting them in a ticket to riot support but I've yet to get a response.  i have also tried doing the \"set the time and date back by 1\" thing. At this point im pretty much begging someone who had this issue and resolved it to help me out. thank you\r\n\r\ngyazo links:\r\n1) https://gyazo.com/517556e84375164114c7de92e580089f\r\n2) https://gyazo.com/57951525d8b6c0af11327332feea4ca0\r\n3) https://gyazo.com/1851f68056de9e7dd5a9051084d3825e\r\n\r\nit almost feels like the 3rd pic is mocking me.","replies":[{"poster":"DuelMasterARYAN","date":"2017-10-20T20:48:13.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ummmmm, ever since i downloaded this patch every time i go to start a game when i enter the loading screen it is pure black, im unable to do anything, to shut down the computer, switch programs, etc. All i can see is my mouse. What should I do. Around the time this started i also downloaded the PBE and it said that it would take 4000 minutes to do. The PBe thing may be irrelevant but I really want to play some league.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-20T18:12:01.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, you might have some overzealous security settings or anti-virus that's blocking your game files and install from updating properly.
