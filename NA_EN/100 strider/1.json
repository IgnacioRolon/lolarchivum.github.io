You should be able to resolve this by first disabling your Firewall/Antivirus that you have running, then head into your League install folder (C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends). Once inside this folder, delete the **LeagueClient.exe** file, then launch the **lol.launcher.admin.exe** file as admin (right click) and attempt the upgrade again.\n\nOnce the process completes, you can re-enable your Firewall/Antivirus. Let me know if this resolved the error for you.","replies":[]}]}
