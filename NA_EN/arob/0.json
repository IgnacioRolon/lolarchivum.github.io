I’m sure I’m not alone in this feeling. Treeline has been fun for me from the start. I wish we could change Riot’s mind about canceling yet another beloved game mode. If anyone wants to share their grief about losing Treeline or if you just want to share things you enjoyed about it, this is the thread. Here are some things I’ll miss about Treeline:\r\n1) Vilemaw- aka the best buff in the game\r\n2) The unique altar system\r\n3) Smaller teams\r\n4) Much less toxicity\r\n5) Abusing bots to get chests for champs that I’m not good with\r\n6) Awesome Treeline items like Wooglet’s Witchcap and Lord Van Dam’s Pillager\r\n7) Short matches\r\n8) The map itself","replies":[{"poster":"mack9112","date":"2019-11-16T06:28:09.207+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":14,"body":"If it was good people would have played it or at least had some kind of community.","replies":[{"poster":"OfficerKilljoy","date":"2019-11-16T07:31:05.835+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=mack9112,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rtLAAfkb,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-11-16T06:28:09.207+0000)\n>\n> If it was good people would have played it or at least had some kind of community.\n\nit wasn't played because riot almost never maintained it properly or balanced it.

It never got the same amount of support as summoner's rift, and so riot let it get terminally ill, then said \"oh no it died, guess we better bury it now\".","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SiG DxD","date":"2019-11-16T14:15:33.867+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot doesnt even give a single fk about it\n\nthey just removed .. just like dominion\n\nthey dont care about 3v3 or what dominion was\n\nthey grow in budget but not in other areas like maps","replies":[]},{"poster":"Infernape","date":"2019-11-16T20:46:25.741+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just wish Riot actually replaced it with a fast paced PvP mode that isn't based entirely around RNG.
