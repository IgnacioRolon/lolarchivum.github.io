I don’t think it’s completely trash but it definitely could be improved. I have some ideas that I think would improve it. Tweaks, suggestions, and other ideas are welcome. A RIOT support member recommended I voice my ideas on the boards, so here I am.\r\n-\r\n1) A recent idea I’ve had is to give the higher honor levels more meaning. This is a way to do that without messing with gameplay really. This idea would give high honor players more honor votes. For example: honor 3 and below remain the same, honor 4 is able to give honor to 2 allies after a match, and honor 5 is able to honor 2 allies and an enemy after the match. Like I said, not game changing, but it would be a nice perk for reaching high honor.\r\n2) Make honor loot matter. In my experience, honor look is extremely trivial. Usually no more than a key fragment and very limited blue essence. An account level gives more value but is easier to attain. My idea is this, at the very least, replace the blue essence in honor orbs with orange essence. Orange essence is rare to earn, and honor orbs take awhile to get and are at least limited. A perfect fit in my opinion. Other things could be added to these orbs but I think this minor change would be sufficient, very welcome, and make the orbs feel more than useless.\r\n3) Whenever someone is chat restricted they fall completely from grace. If you’ve worked for 6 months or so and are honor 4-5 finally, it’s nice. But then if you are having a rough day and get tilted by the inevitable toxic idiot, and you react and say a few mildly harsh things, Riot will not only chat restrict you for a few days, but will kill your honor allllll the way down to 1. Completely ridiculous to go from an A to an F just because you fail one assignment (normal game), not even a quiz (ranked game). My fix for this. Make a probationary system. If a player gets chat restricted, knock them down one honor peg. Also monitor to see if they are honored in any of their next 10 games or something. If so then they only fall by that 1 honor peg. If not maybe they fall more, I’m not sure. Or even don’t do the probation part, simply knock them down 1 honor peg and leave it at that. In my experience each honor peg (like from 3 to 4) takes a couple months anyway. Even with getting 1-2 honors usually.\r\n-\r\nSo these are my honor system ideas right now. Might have more later, not sure. Add any you have. Be sure to upvote if you want honor improved, that way maybe someone important might take note.","replies":[]}
