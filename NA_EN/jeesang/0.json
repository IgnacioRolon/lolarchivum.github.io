There are some solo laners that will get absolutely wrecked by an adc/supp pair. Done correctly the switch will be a surprise and the opposing team's solo laner will be killed or pushed out of lane. If this happens it is usually followed with a tower kill abd a lane being pushed.\n\nAt a pro level that is *then* followed by the lane-swapping team conglomerating around dragon for an uncontested dragon stack. (Because the team who got wrecked has to send someone top to push the lane back.)\n\nAnytime you watch the LCS, see if you can tell what actions the respective teams took to push for objective control and a lot of strategies may make more sense.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AwesomeChad","date":"2015-02-05T02:14:38.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LegendOfAether,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=c4U4jElx,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-02-03T03:35:59.481+0000)\n>\n> Okay so whenever I tune in to watch LCS, I always see teams doing the \"Lane Swap\" strat where the bottom lane goes top and the top lane goes bottom. From the moment I first saw this I always wondered, what is the point of this strat? I never really understood it? I thought the top laners would just go top and the bottom laners would just go bot? (I am aware that I sound very ignorant xD)\n\nFirst off, lane swaps ensure that your adc gets farm.  Lets say that your bot lane has an unfavorable match-up: if they stay in lane, they will most likely lose the lane without any help from their jungler and this forces your allies to spend resources gankiing bottom. The enemy jungler realizes that he doesnt need to come bot lane much and he can spend most of his time getting the other lanes ahead.  By lane swapping,  your adc is guaranteed to have the items he needs to deal dmg in mid game. For top laners, this means that they will get denied alot of cs HOWEVER, generally with the top lane picks, the players choose champions that scale well with levels so in that case, the top laner's main focus is to get exp so he can keep up in levels.  There are other, more specific reasons for lane swaps but this is one of the main ones.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mrackham","date":"2015-02-03T22:53:12.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here we go:\n\nThe short answer is, you lane swap in order to give your team the greatest possible advantage heading into the mid/late game (after laning phase).\n\nFor a longer answer:\n\nTeams might lane swap if there is a large skill differential between the top laners, or between the duo laners.  They also might do it to switch out of a bad matchup, say if either their duo lane or top lane got counterpicked hard.\n\nAnother reason to swap is to try to create a situation where your ADC gets to solo farm, jumping them into their mid/late game powerspikes earlier.  Teams like Cloud 9 do this a lot to allow Sneaky to start hard carrying even sooner.\n\nOne last reason that teams might lane swap is simply to make the other team react to it.  When lanes are swapped, a lot of successive, correct decisions need to be made (by both teams, but primarily by the team who was swapped against).  If the swapped-against team makes the correct decisions, both teams will likely come out even, but if the swapped-against team makes the wrong decisions, they can easily come out way behind (I think C9's top laner, Balls, came out of laning phase in Week 1's games an average of *40 CS* ahead of his opponent).  Because of this, experienced and strategic teams (think C9, TSM) often like to lane swap against new teams, simply because the new teams haven't learned all the ins and outs of responding to it.\n\nTeams have to consider the drawbacks, however, which include the other team \"calling\" the lane swap (sending their own duo lane up top to meet with the original duo), the other team gaining early dragon control (if you send your duo lane top, the enemy team outnumbers you near the dragon pit, which can easily translate into free/uncontested dragons), and finally the fact that your top laner will most likely have to himself face a 2 v. 1 lane, which will probably set them back in farm (which is why another commenter mentioned the fact that you only want to do it if your top laner is one who can handle lane swaps, or doesn't need too much farm*).\n\nThe upshot is that teams will (or should) only consider a lane swap if all of the factors combine to set them ahead, rather than behind.\n\n*This is why you see teams adopting strategies designed to get their own top laner rolling into the laning phase, including things like double jungling (clearing the first few camps with the jungler) to pick up experience and make it harder for the top laner to get bullied out of lane by the 2 v. 1.\n\nTL;DR:\nLane swaps create situations that, for a number of reasons, put your team ahead.  They do come with drawbacks, however, and so need to be done correctly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kratos263","date":"2015-02-03T03:40:50.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it is to let the adc farm better and/or get a fast tower, and the other team wont swap because they would lose too much time doing so.
