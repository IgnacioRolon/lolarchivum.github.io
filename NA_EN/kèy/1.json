At first, I thought it was my GPU, but when I reinstalled all the drivers, I realized it wasn't my GPU. I turned my setting down to low, and it still makes my frames drop. My pc is up to date on everything, Windows updates, CPU drivers, GPU driver, Motherboard Drivers, etc. I hope someone can help me with this, as it's affecting my gameplay.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-28T15:34:37.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for all the troubleshooting so far!
