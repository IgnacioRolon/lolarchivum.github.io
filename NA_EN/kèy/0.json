Crashing could mean many things, depending on what's happening.  Could be a Windows error, PvP.net disconnections, etc.  Screenshots of the error itself is usually just the fastest way to see what's going on.\n\nIf it's disconnecting you from anything before jumping into a game, I'd say that it's likely some form of error that's a result of an instability in the connection between your computer and our servers.   If that's the case, then I'd recommend checking out our [Connection Troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).\n\nIf you can get us a screenshot of the actual error that pops up, that'd help the most in identifying the specific cause.","replies":[{"poster":"Kèy","date":"2016-05-05T05:53:42.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for your help, RiotBok.
