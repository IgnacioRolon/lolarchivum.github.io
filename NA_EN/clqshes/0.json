We really have no way to force or expedite a PBE application, though.  I don't have any info on how to get in beyond our [PBE FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751904-Public-Beta-Environment-FAQ).

Obviously if you are toxic and stuff they will not usually pick you either, but you do not seem bad. My roommate in college freshman year was on PBE when we first moved in and that was the stuff he told me, so just repeating it so it might not be 100% accurate.","replies":[]}]}
