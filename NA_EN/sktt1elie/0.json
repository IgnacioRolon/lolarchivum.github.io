As i said in the title i am a S IV player in NA and the reason i wanted to write you is because i was supporting an ADC who was in Bronze 5 with 0 LP - tilted and trolling lanes (took the lane of our Cho'gath - mid) going there and started feeding intentionally saying \"i am done\" and things like this all the game, flaming me and whole my team. So my Big question is how exactly Riot took the decision to put me in One game with him. Do i deserve to play with bronze players. Do i play in Bronze? Wasn't i put really big efforts to do not play In bronze And with bronzers especially when they are in Bronze 5 with 0 LP and tilted? Do i play this game to be put in one game with him and the to lose it? I have a screenshot by the way.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-22T02:16:46.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a chance that the player was placed in that match because their MMR was actually high enough to warrant being matched with the rest of the people on your team. When finding matches, the system looks for people with similar MMR's to put together.","replies":[]}]}
