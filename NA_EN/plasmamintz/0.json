The last skin he got was over a year ago and it was 750 RP. Before that, his last skin was a 1350, which is good, but it&#039;s over two years old. Vel&#039;Koz may be unpopular, but that doesn&#039;t mean that our poor voidling friend should be left out from this frenzy of new skins.","replies":[{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2017-06-01T12:42:57.620+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol he only has 2 skins what are u talking about arclight and battle cast there isn't a third 750 skin","replies":[{"poster":"ThePikol","date":"2017-06-01T12:44:57.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is definitely not Vel'koz","replies":[{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2017-06-01T12:47:05.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"whos that","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-06-01T13:09:48.017+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk, i think the guy is just crazy.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fairyfleur","date":"2017-06-01T14:38:34.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you missed the joke","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Vanic998","date":"2017-06-01T16:13:52.381+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I absolutely agree.
