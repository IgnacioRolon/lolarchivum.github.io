So i thought of a compromise, I know this is kinda unpopular as many people including me have wanted soloqueue back but since riot won&#039;t do that despite our wishes what if we made dynamic queue stop as soon as you reached diamond or maybe plat? This is a much smaller much more competitive group and people take diamond players much more seriously in competitive terms. A diamond 1 player can get to challenger but a bronze or silver or gold wont. I think making ranked soloqueue at diamond and above would fix the issues of long queue times and lack of competitive integrity. As a low elo player myself I wish I could soloqueue too but since riot don&#039;t want that I think this compromise could fix the more serious issues. Furthermore, riots main goal of dynamic queue which is having more people play ranked would be achieved as the vast vast majority of ranked players are low elo.\r\n\r\nClearly riot doesn&#039;t want to bring back soloqueue(unfortuantlely) but why not make dynamic turn into soloqueue at the higher elo were it matters most.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-04-16T20:26:43.001+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree with this idea.  Having soloque only for the upper ranks of d3 and higher would solve a lot of their problems.  I personally would be fine with that (as much as I want soloque I think dynamic que is overall better for the game,  this video helps explain it more https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pzwnD_HV7g)\n\nThe only real problem here is the community's hate filled response when only the top 1-2% of the community get the soloque that they have been hammering the boards for.\n\nJust my two cents.","replies":[{"poster":"Titanium70","date":"2016-04-17T00:12:37.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"^this","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cobra1066","date":"2016-04-16T23:35:22.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"nice points.:)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Weathered","date":"2016-04-17T01:27:11.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am so confused why people are making this a thing. I understand both sides, but I've actually climbed 2 ranks more than i was last season (even after season reset) playing solo in Dynamic. People just need something to complain about and scape goat not having an easy time climbing.","replies":[]}]}
