Just like you don't need an entirely new computer to run the Unreal Engine vs Unity Engine for games, the new engine could work within the existing minimum requirements.\n\nThe biggest thing to consider is that we're asking for things that weren't even a consideration when League's engine was first built. They had *maybe* 20 voice lines for Champions, they weren't concerned with making a system that could handle hundreds of lines and keep track of who said what. \n\nBlizzard likely looked at League and DotA's shortcomings and designed their engine to do things the others couldn't. 5 years from now they may run into other issues with HotS that Riot can avoid with a new engine they build, etc.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"imbrus","date":"2017-07-12T16:52:33.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a shame\n\noh well, keep up the good work","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-07-12T13:26:43.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is, you get it when Urgot kills Sion with his ult.","replies":[]}]}
