What do you do in team fights lol?  Please explain. Do you focus her while the team kills your team. Do some of you focus her while the assassins and such go after their squishies  resulting in the fed focusing her dying.  I don't understand lol, now dont get me wrong i understand she has a weakness. but is it really a weakness if it forces you to zone yourself out?  oh contest baron/elder/ dragon?  no thanks walk away cus her ult is up.  oh team fight... oh nvm her ult is up. like come on man. my team was ahead of the other team, but she  basically beat our whole team. she wasnt even freaking fed. she simply could deal enourmous amounts of damage. and it took so long to kill her that their shitty ass adc was taking turrets.   Again  every champ has weaknesses, but are they really weaknesses they force you ti run away from objectives.","replies":[{"poster":"Rayjay Redfang","date":"2018-02-08T12:22:39.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"Yes it is important to know when to back off in a team fight, especially when there are assassin's gunning for your carries. Walking out of her ult doesn't even require focusing her. It is the opposing of focusing her because you are walking away, and if she is tanky enough to where she is so hard to kill, you probably shouldn't be focusing her by staying in her ult and ignoring her team. CC her and walk aeay, meanwhile walk away or kill tentacles. Champions have disengage skills for a reason.  I have no idea what you are on about that adc comment, that's irrelevant.\n\nIt isn't a weaknesses on illaoi's part to zone from objectives that is part of the strengths of her ult.","replies":[{"poster":"DoomSeeker","date":"2018-02-11T09:01:39.532+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think what he is saying is, if u need to cc her, run away from her, kill her tentacles, just to avoid her insane amount of dmg while being insanely tanky, all of that WHILE in a team fight where there are other champs that can do massive loads of dmg, doesn't sound like a reasonable argument. \n\nbasically what u r saying is, if u see an illaoi near her allies, NEVER engage cuz she has ult up... thats not a solution, thats a problem to the game. if you cant take her out fast and she does insane amount of dmg and can harass from a distance, thats quite a dumb champion.\n\nall in all I agree in and disagree with some of what the op says, the only thing that works in her favor is insane lane control, which ruins opponent team top lane, the only thing i wanna see fixed with her is the range of E escape after she hits you with it. will still make you not able to engage carelessly, but at least u would have a better chance to not take insane amount of dmg and harass from across the whole lane","replies":[{"poster":"Rayjay Redfang","date":"2018-02-12T03:05:07.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"1) I dont know what you are saying in your first part\n2) that is not what i'm saying. I'm saying that disengaging is apart of teamfighting and then the team can rengaging again. That doesn't mean you can't engage at all into an illaoi. There are plenty of champions that can engage on her and negate her ult completly: Janna, Trist, kindred to an extent, taric, azir, urgot,ect. \n3)My point being, there are strategies and champions that deal with illaoi quite well. She isn't op, but if you have no one on your comp that exploits her weaknesses well, then you will have a hard time. This goes the same for other champions like vayne, and akali.","replies":[{"poster":"PointSlasher","date":"2018-09-15T11:29:16.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why does everyone have to pick certain champ to shut down one champion?\nand one who says to just walk off then you are just ignoring the slows from tentacles, its massive not every champ is mobile.\nIt is just stupid to say u can easily disengage from fights or her ult.\nULT should just not fucking heal her.\nIt was everytime more viable to kill her rather than disengage","replies":[{"poster":"Rayjay Redfang","date":"2018-09-18T18:05:25.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Champions counter pick other champions generally and does not guarantee a win, it just gives an advantage.

You can't time her damage, she does damage without any animation. No burn, just flat damage, I've seen the replay. It comes from thin air., if even one of those tentacles are anywhere near you, they do damage even when they miss. Fuck this champ!
