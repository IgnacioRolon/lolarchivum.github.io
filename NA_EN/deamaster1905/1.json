I&#039;m desperately trying to get out of silver, but somehow my team always feeds. Some of you may say that I should carry more, but I mean that doesn&#039;t work.

If you want to really break out of silver it's easier than you think. \n1 Main 1 champion have like 2 backups\n2 OTP this champion\n3 because of your focus on 1 champion you will start to gain game knowledge and know when to do certain things\n4???\n5 Get promoted to Gold 4+\n\nUsually is going to be Game knowledge that holds you back. When I first placed in season 3 I placed Bronze 4. This season I placed Plat 4. That is a huge Difference and I am a Ekko OTP.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Done25","date":"2019-02-04T15:52:58.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't flame your team.
