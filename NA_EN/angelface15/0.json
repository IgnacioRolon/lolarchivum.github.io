She says her line &quot;Afraid to get your feet wet?&quot; or whatever else and then goes to splash the water forward with her tail, but theres no water. I&#039;m pretty sure it works fine on her River Spirit skin but the other two, not at all and it&#039;s been bugged for a while. Please fix it Riot!","replies":[{"poster":"Mistral","date":"2015-07-21T18:38:04.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I noticed this too, but I thought I was just wrong about it. xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-21T17:52:30.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya AngelFace15! \n\nThanks for the report!
