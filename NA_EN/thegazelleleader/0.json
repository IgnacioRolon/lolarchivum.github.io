I won the series I recently got into and checked to see if I was Plat 4, it showed I was Plat 5 still in my profile so I restarted my client hoping it would refresh, so when I get back into the client, it still said I was Plat 5. My friends invited me to a game and I decided to play with them, we lost the game and when the client reopened it said I was in my series still (showing the three dashes under the IP and XP circles with one X from the loss). This actually really upsets me because I've been trying for a month to get back into Plat 4 and the client decides to reset my series at last minute before the season ends...","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-05T18:01:30.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your profile may not have updated right away, but it looks like you had a[ queue dodge](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging) during your series which counts as a loss during your placements.  The queue dodge with a previous loss ended the series.  Hopefully that helps clear some things up, and best of luck climbing to 4!","replies":[]}]}
