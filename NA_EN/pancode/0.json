Wanted to make it look like she was peeking out from the bottom, similar to the Peeking Miku stickers. Normally I wouldn&#039;t post my fanart but I decided to make this the first. I also previously made a minimalist Star Guardian wallpaper using several of their weapons, if you wanna check that out. \nAny opinions or criticisms appriciated :)\n\n(EDIT: I have remade the post with the printed versions being on my phone, and hid the original mockup post. Use this new one to see how the sticker looks IRL: https://dribbble.com/shots/3992720-Peeking-Poppy)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Ve1vet","date":"2017-11-21T02:04:04.211+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh my gosh that's adorable \n{{sticker:sg-lux}}","replies":[{"poster":"pancode","date":"2017-11-23T04:46:00.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Ve1vet,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=YRMthsAu,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-11-21T02:04:04.211+0000)\n>\n> Oh my gosh that&#x27;s adorable \n> {{sticker:sg-lux}}\n\nThanks! <3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Friendly Ram","date":"2017-11-20T23:29:18.496+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"wouldn't that fit better on a pocket of something?","replies":[{"poster":"pancode","date":"2017-11-23T04:46:48.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Friendly Ram,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=YRMthsAu,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-11-20T23:29:18.496+0000)\n>\n> wouldn&#x27;t that fit better on a pocket of something?\n\nI thought about that too honestly.
