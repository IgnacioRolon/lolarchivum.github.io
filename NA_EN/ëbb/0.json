This had happened to me twice, right after each game. I had reset my modem before going into the second one. This had never happened to me unless there was a device connected. Although, after disconnecting it, it would go back to its regular ping which is 70. What is this problem? how would i solve it?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-30T23:24:44.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe switching clients would do anything with your ping, since the issue is specifically with the game server and not pvp.net.  I suggest running a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) to get a better overview of what's going on exactly.  Let me know what you find!","replies":[{"poster":"ëbb","date":"2016-12-08T14:44:44.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did its what my friend first suggested.. I checked everything and it was all fine. Although when the patch came out, I could switch just fine now. I don't know why it did it, because that was the only time I would get ping spikes up to 5000. Thank you though! :D","replies":[]}]}]}
