But if the stealth was added to his W in exchange for a longer CD, and if his pull had a much longer delay for maximum range, and if the Darius ult replaced his low-CD instant AoE silence, and if his targeted knockup was turned into an AoE skillshot, and if his automatic low-health shield were turned into a heal that required him to stay out of sight, and if all bonus health were converted to an offensive stat... maybe that would be fine.","replies":[{"poster":"EthreainAmbusher","date":"2019-06-23T20:32:29.877+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"did you just make pyke?","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-23T21:37:14.183+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EthreainAmbusher,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0fR92QMP,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2019-06-23T20:32:29.877+0000)\n>\n> did you just make pyke?\n\nThat's kinda the thread topic, so yeah.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2019-06-22T21:54:25.806+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":">  because champ like that doesnt' exist in league, or am i wrong?\n\nYou are correct  this does not exist in league, and I have to say i find some irony in this because you have exaggerated things to a point it does not reflect the game. \n\nI know its not your intent or how you wanted your post to be interpreted. Yet what you just described is not pyke.   The pull is not like blitz with 0 cast time and max range instantly from 1 tap. Darius R is point and click.\n\nWhy your describing does not exist because in your frustration you have grossly exaggerated things to not accurately represent the game.\n\nIf players just made posts that accurately expressed their frustration with out exaggerating things to unrealistic levels there would be more productive conversations. I don't mind that your mad at pyke, hell your welcome to hate the champ and his kit.  I just wish you kept it more accurate because basically everything sounds OPAF if you make an effort to portray it over the top.\n\nI doubt you will appreciate me for making this comment but please understand its nothing personal.
