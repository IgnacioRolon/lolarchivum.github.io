We both played the game before we knew each other. I recognized he had much more game knowledge than me(since I had only been playing for a year) but I seemed to have better mechanics, maybe that was attributed to the fact that I was an avid rock-climber at the time.\nHe would become very upset if I placed higher than him in ranked or if I just had a good game while he was feeding. He would find ways to undermine my good plays or devalue my efforts. \nHave any of you had to deal with situations like this? I&#039;m curious because this guy was a huge jerk but there&#039;s no way he&#039;s the only person treating someone like this. It doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;re male or female but I see why it bothered him so much. He probably wanted to feel above me and that&#039;s something all sorts of people will try to do to others <Removed by Moderation>. Can anyone relate?","replies":[]}
