She is an exceptionally broken champ in blind because if you don't pick someone that counters her its just a complete joke. Normals are for learning a new champ or just having fun, not playing the same champion 7 days a week every game just because she has an 80% completely dominate because of the lackluster team comps in blind pick. I wish riot COULD do something about her pub stomping, but I don't think she's overpowered in a real game and shouldn't be nerfed. The noobs who main her and never play a ranked game in their and sit up on their high horse talking trash because they won a normal game are the reason I will never play the convenient blind pick game mode again.","replies":[{"poster":"coppinslinger","date":"2015-01-08T07:52:27.781+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I don't even know why the champ exists. Her kit is the definition of toxic. Here's how lane-phase goes:\n\nLeblanc jumps in and uses her rotation:\n1) You die and then get completely zoned for the rest of lane-phase.\n2) You don't die, but Leblanc ports back and takes marginal return damage. You get completely zoned for the rest of lane-phase.\n3) You chain-CC her long enough or burst Leblanc heavily enough to kill her.\n\nYeah she can make \"flashy\" plays but just jumping around and killing people with complete safety (port-back) with point and click abilities is ridiculous. Either your champ can lock-down Leblanc long enough to kill her, or you can't. That's the only counterplay to the champ.\n\nThe only reason she has a low win-rate as it is is because she's squishy af and people who play her don't necessarily position correctly or jump in at the wrong times. There's a reason she's pick or ban right now in Korea. Too much power in an extremely linear and SAFE kit.\n\nPS: I don't think she's overpowered in SoloQ (definitiely in the highest level of plays though she is) because it takes a lot of skill to manage her squishiness CDs and ports outside of lane-phase - especially in full-fledged teamfights where a single stun can mean your death. I just think her kit is unhealthy for the game. It's either you win or she wins more or less based on the champions you pick. Not much else goes into it during lane-phase.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-01-08T06:47:12.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you could pick something to counter her, what would it be then?
