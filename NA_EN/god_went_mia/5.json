Spoiler alert, we lost because the premade roamed everywhere together and TP ganked several times. If you are going to add this feature, DO NOT let there be premades on one team and not the other. This is a joke. As it is even if there are premades on both teams it totally ruins the game for the random they are matched with.","replies":[{"poster":"Itadaki Seieki","date":"2016-01-14T20:03:23.816+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is almost impossible.\n\nThere is a  95% chance you'll be matched up against another premade.\n\nYou must have really crap RNG if you're the 5% to go against a premade.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2016-01-14T21:09:11.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree. They claim if you aren't in a premade then you'll almost never see one against you. But you should NEVER at all see one against you. Its like the whole afk argument riot uses, about how it'll all even out over time. But the thing is, ppl like me who don't play this game with friends shouldn't have to be stuck playing against premades, cuz it wont even out over time. Since i don't ever play with ppl....i can never be in a game where im the premade against an enemy team without one. Idk if this made sense to anyone but i tried. Point is....you should NEVER EVER EVER be matched against a premade in ranked if your team doesnt have one!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Phoenix Kotori ","date":"2016-01-14T20:05:24.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You realize 90% of ranked matches before had duos in them right?\n\nHow do you know you didn't have duo/trio on your team who were lacking?","replies":[]}]}
