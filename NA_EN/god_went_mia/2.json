In a lot of cases this is a win in champ select, no skill required. Most people in Solo Queue do not have the teamwork, chemistry, or presence of mind to pick some of the few counters to a team comp like this, and there is very little counterplay to it. In team 5s and LCS, aka all riot cares about, sure, it&#039;s not a problem at all with good teamwork. but in this joke of a community its a massive chance for a win.\r\nIt&#039;s stupid because simply by picking 2 or 3 certain champs, you can have an above average chance to win no matter what happens in lane. Malphite, Yasuo, wukong, or whoever can all get dumped on, but Malphite&#039;s base damage is enough to 1 hit carries by itself, and yasuo&#039;s CC and damage from his ult are enough to carry teamfights even if he isn&#039;t fed, and he will eventually scale to be one of the strongest champs in the game. Let&#039;s just ignore that fact that AD fighter carries like yasuo should all be reliant on lane and skill instead of good scaling no matter what, thats not the point of this.\r\n\r\nIf this game was truely about skill, there wouldn&#039;t be gimmicky crap like this. Yasuo&#039;s ult synergy is so far above any other wombo combos potential and works with so many champions so well.\r\nA blind goldfish and its pet rock could win more than half their games simply by picking Yasuo and a knock up and forcing teamfights. That shouldn&#039;t be the case; this game should be determined by skill, not who you pick.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2016-01-07T05:44:55.538+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo-centric team comps place a lot of weight on the Yasuo player, just like Protect the ADC comps or what have you. They have a lot of synergy, but they still rely on the team being able to work together and the linchpin player being good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Applesaucey","date":"2016-01-07T05:32:03.025+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every time my team does this the yasuo ends up being terrible and it bites us in the ass hard.","replies":[]}]}
