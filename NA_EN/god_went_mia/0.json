Abilities taking 30s sometimes to fire off, message in chat appearing 90s after I sent them, minions are stuck attacking each other or getting hit by tower and taking no damage/not moving/stuck in base. Completely unplayable and unfortunate instant loss for my team.\n\nI'm on a wireless connection and I restarted my router and my PC, both to no avail.

The way you described your champion stopping for about 10 seconds then everything rushing to catch up really sounds like some packet loss problems. take the network logs from that game, pop them into our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) so that it can scan them to see just what was going on with your connection in that match.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I need a shave","date":"2017-07-24T07:18:15.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I posted about this about a week ago but was completely ignored. The game is unplayable for me, and I never had an lag issues until recently. Nothing has changed on my end, and I still don't have any lag issues with any other game.
