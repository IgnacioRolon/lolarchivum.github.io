Ever tried farming vs Brand with a low range champion like Kayle ? Most miserable experience you will ever have I guarantee. Annie doesn't even compare. You can AFK farm vs Annie all day long if you want and she can't do shit to stop you and her stun is dog shit easy to play around. Annie has never been much of a problem for me, even with melee champs like Akali. Brand on the other hand......god...just kill me.\n\nIn all fairness, Brand only started becoming a problem when they gave him that ridiculous new passive and pair that with Thunderlords, and his damage becomes over the top.","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2016-10-29T23:00:38.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play Brand, and I feel you. There are a few issues though.\n\n> Annie can't hit you with a pillar of fire from a mile away. Ever tried farming vs Brand with a low range champion like Kayle ? Most miserable experience you will ever have I guarantee.\n\nThis here is because the Brand was smart. Pillar of Flame is a telegraphed AOE explosion with a .75 second delay. Easily avoidable with boots. My guess is that the Brand waited till you tried to CS before casting it beneath your feet. Your AA delay wouldn't let you move out of the way in time.\n\nThere are two ways to keep a Brand on his toes. You can farm with your abilites and force him to use his to farm under tower. Pillar is maxed first, and I will OOM if I spam that spell along with Conflaguration to farm or harass. This leads to another thing.\n\nI cannot harass you forever. I will OOM and then I cannot fight you effectively. Wait till a Brand is about 100-200 mana, then fight him. At most I can only do a pillar and a fireball. Then I'm helpless. If a Brand is constantly harasing you from farm chances are you are still pretty full mana-wise, so you can go all in on him and hit him with multiple rotations. You will get a flash or a kill. Brand's damage is gated behind his passive. His damage has been lowered across the board and loaded into a passive that rewards him for getting multiple hits on an enemy.\n\n> In all fairness, Brand only started becoming a problem when they gave him that ridiculous new passive and pair that with Thunderlords, and his damage becomes over the top.\n\nNo offense, but what kind of Brands are you fighting? Deathfire is better on Brand 100% of the time. The burn refreshes with the passive burn so well, and Deathfire has no cooldown. It's like I'm doubling up on my burn. Add {{item:3151}} and I can watch health melt.","replies":[{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2016-10-29T23:06:00.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TyrekGoldenspear,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=N9UnsV2q,comment-id=0006000000000000,timestamp=2016-10-29T23:00:38.303+0000)\n>\n> No offense, but what kind of Brands are you fighting? Deathfire is better on Brand 100% of the time.\n\nI fought a couple that played Thunderlords. They were super aggressive and constantly attempted to proc it early game for huge damage. My guess is they were using a general rune/mastery set up for mages and most mages rock Thunderlords. I too have a lot of general runes/masteries. I often end up using sub-optimal setups since I can't account for every champion's nuances with 6 or 7 rune pages. I only have specific setups for my mains.","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2016-10-29T23:09:39.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, that makes sense.
