A while ago I was Viktor in mid lane against a Ziggs.  I ended laning phase 4/0/?? and Ziggs was 0/5/1.  My teammates were in Skype with me and we were doing pretty well.  We were winning in kills, towers, and dragons.  At about 25 minutes in another friend joined our Skype call and looked up the enemy team on Lolnexus.  He told my team of silvers/bronzes the enemy ranks.  Apparently, Ziggs was Plat 4 while the rest of their team was mid-silver.  I really wish I was exaggerating what happened after, but I'm not...  \n\nMy reaction:  \"Really?  He didn't seem that good in lane.  I destroyed him in CS and kills.\"  \nMy jungler and ADC:  \"Oh crap, he's Plat?  Well, this is over.\"  \nMe:  \"What?  Guys, we've been beating him all game.  His rank means nothing now.\"  \n\nAt this point we had all of their outer towers down, their entire mid was gone, with an exposed inhibitor, and both of top's lane towers were gone.  We tried a push for the inhibitor and went 2 for 2 in the ensuing teamfight.  Loss of both ADCs, our top, and their jungler.  We didn't get the inhib, but the remaining champions of both teams were relatively good hp-wise and my team backed off and got a third Dragon.  \n\nADC:  \"GUYS, PLAT ZIGGS.  JUST SURRENDER NOW.\"  \nMe:  \"How does knowing that change anything?  Until now, we've been winning.  You're VAYNE.  We have an Irelia.  We already crushed early, we can keep beating them and we're even stronger late-game.\"  \nADC:  \"It was luck.  We can't beat him.\"  \nMe:  \"What.  That makes no sense...  He's 1/9/2, I'm 10/1/6.  Their ADC is 4/4/3.  You're 5/3/5.  We can win.\"  [Thinking:  Excuse me?  What happened in lane was not luck.  I beat him HARD.]  \n*A surrender vote has failed for your team, 3/2.*  \n\nThe game dragged out for another 20 minutes, but our ADC was still half-panicking and didn't want to engage in any teamfights despite the fact that we had an advantage.  Eventually the enemy won a teamfight and pushed our mid and got the inhib.  I, our support, and our jungler forced them out of our base before we lost anything else, but the damage was done and our ADC's morale was completely crushed.  Our ADC and Jungler's negativity had started to take its toll on our top-laner, and our support was trying to stay out of things, but still keep morale up.  It felt like we were the only two holding the team together, but even that got hard as things went on.  Even though the support had faith we could win, the rest of the team's attitude was getting to him and PM'd me that if another surrender went out, he'd vote yes just to avoid saying something he'd regret.  'We' surrendered a few minutes later.  \n\nIt was incredibly annoying.  We were ahead all game, but immediately after learning that an enemy was *technically* a higher rank, we started losing.  Nothing else changed in the game, just knowing that the enemy was 'better' made the team's morale plummet.  In all honesty, I felt really good for beating a Plat player.  I've only done one solo-queue ranked game this season (ranked isn't that interesting to me), but I was Silver 4 last season.  I was doing well that game and felt confident we could win.  Our team was doing better, we had two dragons, and we had good lane-control and vision.  After the game, I asked the other friend why he even mentioned the rank, and he was also really surprised at our ADC's reaction.  He was spectating our game and agreed that we really had a chance of winning if only our ADC focused more.  We couldn't figure out why he flipped out that, but I called it a night after that and logged off so didn't really find out more.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"T RexHasTinyArms","date":"2015-05-16T20:09:29.796+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think the biggest thing is that it doesn't really create an advantage to know rank.

In fact, I'd argue there is a decent probability that if a bronze player is in a gold game and NOT duo que w/ someone else who has higher MMR than any of the golds in the game, then the bronze player is probably the strongest person on the team. Mainly because to have gold level MMR as a bronze means they have to be on like a 50-1 streak and just happen to not have hit promos for silver yet. The only times I've seen people pull win streaks so good they are in gold as bronze, or like plat/diamond as silver, are challenger/masters players doing smurf grinds on alt accounts.

MMR doesn't. Win rate doesn't either. In order to get any idea what you're up against, you need to go further than that. What I do is check out my lane opponent's stats with their chosen champion. Like last night, I played my first ranked game in over 2 weeks, and was facing a Tryndamere. When I looked at my in-game info, it said he had a KDA of 6 with the guy. Upon further inspection, however, I saw he'd played a total of **1 ** ranked game with him, telling me he probably got lucky and that I likely had the edge (119 with Garen, 5.07 KDA, 53%). Early on, I probed him for weakness to confirm my suspicion, found I could zone him out of CS with ease as he ran or flashed at the first sign of danger, and bullied him with confidence the entire match, doubling his CS and finishing 3/0/5.\n\nThat same match, I mentioned that I hadn't played ranked in 16 days, and our ADC was telling me to play it safe, as if a couple weeks off from ranked means you're rendered useless. She then asked if I was B5, which I answered in the affirmative. This caused her to lament getting stuck with B5s when she's a B3 (B4 with 24 LP, in actuality). I ended the match with the most CS, a perfect KDA, and 3 towers to my name. And after the match, when I just wanted to put her in her place for doubting me, citing the same stats I did in the above paragraph, her response was just \"cocky much?\" This serves as a good example of how knowing your teammate's ranks, and nothing else, could hurt you more than help you. Clearly we all had approximately the same MMR, as that's how the matchmaking system works, but simply knowing I was B5 caused our ADC to write me off from the start. Riot doesn't want that sort of behavior.\n\nSo, yeah, just hop on OP.GG or any of the other sites that serve the same function and research your opponents that way.
