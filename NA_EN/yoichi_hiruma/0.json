It&#039;s simple, responsive doesn&#039;t weight too much and it&#039;s not FB messenger :^]\n\nHope to see many updates soon!\n\nEDIT: WHOOPS! I just saw the search bar on top of the friend list, it was kinda conceiled tho :O","replies":[{"poster":"Sparkle","date":"2016-03-15T17:22:29.685+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad you found it! \n\nFor anyone else wondering, you can pull down on the friend list or when starting a chat from the + button to reveal the filter bar. Also, you can filter by summoner name or buddy note! We wanted it to be out of your way normally, but still there if you need it. :D","replies":[{"poster":"Yoichi Hiruma","date":"2016-03-15T19:04:02.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All in all it's a great idea, maybe a little hint to show it the first time would be cool!","replies":[]}]}]}
