Any help would be appreciated, makes it very difficult to ping mia.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-14T04:58:38.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes that ping radial can go pretty wonky like that when your config settings go a little screwy. Give those a good reset using these steps and try it in a custom game really quick.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[{"poster":"Starmont","date":"2017-12-15T04:38:23.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this worked","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Asuna91","date":"2017-12-14T19:58:20.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has happened for years on record. For me it started doing it randomly in the past 6 months. I try to ping in the middle of doing a teamfight etc and it goes into a random ping and flings the cursor. So far have not found a legit fix.\n\nEDIT: Then again never had someone tell me about the config just did uninstalls to try so give that a shot.\n","replies":[]}]}
