I recommend sticking to custom games for now while this gets troubleshooted, but I'm curious why you feel this is not a problem with your connection.  This problem is pretty common with an unstable connection failing to reach the game server, so any details might help!  Most common issues with Macs are also related to unstable connections.  It's still really important to go through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide in custom games to help rule out possibilities.","replies":[{"poster":"TingAura","date":"2017-10-07T17:16:41.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey Poro can you tell me what to do please","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-07T17:17:39.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the steps in the guide hasn't help, download our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to grab some logs.
