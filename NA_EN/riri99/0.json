Check the part about the riven support and Darius jungle. Who has the jungle item? And he said he won that game, which he actually lost. It was shown in his match history. So it was easily found as a lie. I don't care if he made good points, because when you get caught lying people start to take it less seriously.\n\nMy point for this is that if you're going to lie, make it hard to prove wrong at least. His point that the game isn't fun anymore can be seen as an opinion. Some people do find the game competitive and fun, while others think that it isn't competitive and just boring. it's opinion there. But the facts state that he's banned and he lied about some of the info to try and make people feel sorry for him.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"idoki","date":"2015-09-13T20:45:09.953+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can we stop making threads about dunkey and go back to Vayne/Thresh/Yasuo QQ threads?
