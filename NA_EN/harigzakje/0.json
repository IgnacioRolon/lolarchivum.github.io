I lose LP without playing ranked. The last time i checked i had 19 lp(last ranked game a week ago), today i check and i have 6 lp. I didnt play ranked, i didnt leave a Champion select and i also didnt get a penalty for bad behaviour or something.\r\nThis is the second time such a strange thing happend to me. The first time i was playing my promo's for gold, my series was 1 win 1 lose, than i lose another one and my series was suddenly over, when i still had chance to win my series. So this is the second time such a strange thing happend to me.\r\nI would realy like to have some explanation for my LP problem, why i lose LP when i dont play ranked. \r\n\r\nThanks for your time\r\nHarigzakje","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-20T19:42:17.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, I looked into this for you and I do see 2 queue dodges.  :(  These occurred on the 16th of this month within an hour of each other.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Harigzakje","date":"2017-12-21T12:37:32.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, thanks for your comment. No i dont think so, because that \"dodges\" were not Rankeddodges, that were Aramdodges. Or can u also lose LP if u dodge aram?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-21T16:03:08.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To clarify, those 2 dodges were specifically for ranked games and not ARAM.  You'll lose LP for dodging ranked games, and [queue dodge](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging) can escalate from 3 to 10 regardless of what mode is queue dodged.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
