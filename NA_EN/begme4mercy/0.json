You can hear the sound effect of Kennen &quot;charging&quot;, and the lightings hitting. The range however, is invisible, which makes it rather hard/annoying to play against.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-20T20:36:58.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nWe're currently in the process of running compatibility tests on Kennen and his skins. This isn't something that occurs all the time, which makes tracking down a repro/fix a bit harder than usual.
