Just look at the new champ select, if you queue up as &quot;support&quot; or &quot;fill&quot; as your secondary there is a 60% chance you&#039;re going to get support. People are &quot;fine with playing it&quot; but nobody REALLY wants it. Before you just write me off with &quot;hey support&#039;s fine go away&quot; or &quot;its just a playstyle choice&quot;, I am a (last season) D4 Support Main. I as a support main KNOW that it has power as a role at the moment, is capable of making really big plays and is a viable carry position. But that doesn&#039;t actually make it a desirable role. More often than not, instead of feeling like a powerhouse savior of the people, you feel like the b**ch having to get vision by your self, being underfed and underleveled virtually every game. Notice in proplay right now supports aren&#039;t even getting level 18 in some of the 40-60 minute games that are happening. I feel like support as a role could really use some love :(\n\nEdit- Hey the **support **(get it? :P) here is great and the feedback for both arguments is really good! I've seen a lot of great ideas on here! One was giving the support items/sightstone XP bonuses. What would you guys think of making support items give bonus xp for every minion you DIDN'T last hit? It would allow supports to be more meaningful early game as they could get overleveled/stay even in levels without them getting to strong. And it wouldn't be abusable by solo laners.\n\n Edit 2- \n> The single most important thing supports could bring to the team was vision. And now with the current changes those 3 wards you drop do not feel as impact-full.\n\nDo people agree with this? Should supports get more chances to ward in order to carry games or other areas need more work?  \n \nI will continue to post good ideas with my thoughts to address current issues up here for discussion.","replies":[{"poster":"WinBoat","date":"2016-02-06T16:46:17.928+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":45,"body":"Wait til the next support champion to be released.

Not to mention that vision snowballs way too much still with pinks/blues getting cleared easily by the winning team, so you can´t even stall out games with good vision anymore.\n\nall in all the game lost a lot of strategic depth this preseason and it´s mostly hurting supports, as they were the most strategic role.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2016-02-07T01:07:06.303+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":10,"body":"> all in all the game lost a lot of strategic depth this preseason and it´s mostly hurting supports, as they were the most strategic role.\n\nNot sure I agree with that statement entirely, but as it pertains to supports and their role in the vision game, that may certainly be true.","replies":[{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2016-02-07T01:28:30.424+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":1,"body":"well to maybe illuminate that a bit more:\n\nLoL has always had two rather different SRs: \n\n- 5v5/professional LoL:\nhere the games are still pretty strategic, though right now you also see that games turn into \"lategame\" at min 20already if teams make a single wrong step along the way - it´s just so much more punishing than last seasons, and therefor shotcalling from behind (which always has been hard) gets almost impossible...leaving only the winning team with strategic options for the most part.\n\n- SoloQ:\ngames here are mostly won in Champselect atm, and they snowball out of control insanly fast as you donßt have the coordination to shut down hypermobile threats at any point. Also - many times the jungler will refuse to go wardstone/trinket and sometimes even the support will do so, leaving you absolutly blind and robbing the game of all strategy except outguessing your opponents. EDIT: to elaborate it a tad more - the prvious seasons support had been my go-to if i really wanted to win, as usually it´s farily easy to carry the laning-phase and then setting up vison to control the rest of the map and make sure your team can savly close out the game. Now even if i win the lane rather hard i struggle controlling even just vison around the bottom of the map - compared to playing jungle, were i just have a lot more options to set deepwards early on and move the wards around the map as the pressure shifts.. though if you ever fall behind none of the roles will provide nearly enough vision to make the game feel even remotly under control anymore.\n\n\nmain Reasons for this development from my PoV:\n\n- items are too expensive/to reliant on scaling, so if you fall behind you will take longer to reach your core-gear to at least have a decent chance of making a play of your opponents mistakes. \n- vision just snowballs more as there are less greenwards and pinks/blues can be cleared out with ease by the team in control, sort of as with S2 oracles - winning teams have it easier to defend their oracles and to kill the oracles of their opponents (a good sign of how broken vision is atm is that about any midlaner in proplay will still go spooky-ghosts to make sure the team has an option to avoid facechecking later on)\n- some champdesign is still really far off regarding to offering any counterplay (e.g. fiora 1v1) or regarding to risk/reward (e.g. ecco with a very feast or famine pattern depending on how good he is landing his sorta broken AoE-stun or not).","replies":[]},{"poster":"FrozenMistninja","date":"2016-02-07T14:16:49.271+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=n8ZzIElu,comment-id=0001000400010000,timestamp=2016-02-07T01:07:06.303+0000)\n>\n> Not sure I agree with that statement entirely, but as it pertains to supports and their role in the vision game, that may certainly be true.\n\nWhen games end in 20 mins, how is that not losing strategic depth? You no longer have an objective thats worth dying for, and before you think Im attacking League, Im not. I still love this game, but it doesnt feel nearly as close to the chess match it used to be. I feel like Riot gives us \"new and cool\" strategic options all the time, through items and other means, but It also feels that every time a new option comes 2 were taken in its spot. In season 1 you were called a troll if you tried to support without CV as your summoner spell. THe new blue trinket is cool because it gives a cv that doesnt go away until its cleared, but in some situations like an attempt on a baron steal, that blue trinket is useless, where at least cv couldnt instantly get cleared. Im not even trying to argue the viability of CV, im just saying if you give us all of the strategic peices at the same time, maybe their wouldnt always feel like there was a lack of strategic diversity.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AATTRROOXX","date":"2016-02-07T03:07:15.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Any possible release month?\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}}","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2016-02-07T04:00:14.107+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":2,"body":"LOTS of possible release months.

In laning you are entirely reliant on your ADC not being a potato. If you're ADC is a potato you're fighting a 1v2 lane where the enemy is getting fed (probably resulting in you feeding). As a result of this you will fall even further behind.\n\n2.  An assassin will pretty much always be able to burst you down. Go to ward the wrong bush and you can say good bye to your health bar. This problem is more noticeable with mage supports but a behind tank support can suffer from the same issue.\n\n3. Most ADC mains are toxic and you tend to take the blunt of the blame, deserved or not. (Shout out to junglers)\n\n4. Support doesn't get to hard carry by being an unkillable tank, a flashy assassin or the hyper carry (Unless you're a very fed support). As a result the position is undesirable.

Perhaps more importantly, the faster they rank up their abilities and gain access to their ult, the better they are at making plays.

They can make plays they can win games, but they don't have any flashy numbers to go with them. Not only that, but supports cannot carry, you can set your team up for success all day long but if your team falls flat on their face, all your efforts just go right out the window. \n\nAlso I mentioned numbers, and just going by  numbers, they don't really shine at all. I play a lot of Leona support, and there were many times I'd look at my stats after the match, and unless I simply crushed my lane, I'd have the lowest damage dealt, and even the lowest damage tanked (compared to Top and Jungle), despite being in the middle of every team fight.\n\nNot only that, but assists just aren't praised that much by the game. When someone gets a kill, they see a big box with their picture and sword smacking the other guy, and the assist just gets this tiny little box next to it. All in all, support can feel very unrewarding to play at times, and I think there can be something  done to help with that","replies":[{"poster":"Pokku","date":"2016-02-06T21:29:20.817+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"To help wih numbers, Riot should implement _Damage shielded_.

And now with the current changes those 3 wards you drop do not feel as impact-full. This mean Riot needed something else to make players feel they could really contribute to the game.

There's no recognition by the game when you make an amazing support play. You know, and your teammates might know, but when you save everyone's life and set up the kill on the enemy's carry in a teamfight there's no \"pentassist\". I'm not sure how it would be implemented well but if people got some positive feedback when they play well as a support I think that'd go a long way to making it desirable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mandang0","date":"2016-02-06T23:41:39.754+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMO it's because riot's afraid to let support's power curve ever be strong.  Sure, it probably shouldn't be strong late - that's when carries should shine, but when Riot also makes carries' laning relatively strong, it really shuts things like supports out from having meaningful fantasies.  ADC should be weak in lane, not gifted easy sustain and strong skills.  Lane bully tops and mids should pay for that strength lategame (and lategame should actually happen once in a blue moon).  Supports should be the opposite, in both cases, while obviously not being as strong as either in their strongest phases.\n\nAlso, more interesting itemization would go a long way.  Just look at the utility active items available in Dota.  Those exact items would be broken in LOL, but should serve as a guide for itemization that's more interesting than gp10...sightstone...boots...yaaaaawn.","replies":[]}]}
