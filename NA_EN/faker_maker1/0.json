It also sucks for those who are down a player, though.  The [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) would only apply this queue only if you have a history of leaves as well, not just one game.

After leaving a few games, you will be placed into a low priority queue; as long as you can complete 5 matchmade games without leaving, you will be returned to the normal queue. However, if you continue to leave games, you will remain in the low priority queue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Faker Maker1","date":"2017-11-18T15:45:20.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"we need  answer  riot","replies":[]}]}
