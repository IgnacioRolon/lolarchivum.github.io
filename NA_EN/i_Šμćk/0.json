But as the download approaches 94% it runs into another error and start to re-download again at 33% I have let it re-download about 5 times now and it still gets to 94% and restarts at 33%, so I tried to reinstalling the client from the installer and it still does the same thing..... Anyhelp would be appropriate. \r\nP.S. My laptop is brand new, league is the first game installed. So I don't think there is something wrong with the computer.","replies":[{"poster":"i Šμćk","date":"2016-11-11T20:21:55.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank You, Problem fixed","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-04T23:04:59.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assuming you're specifically receiving the unspecified error, your network might be having trouble keeping a strong connection specifically to the game server and failing to download game files.
