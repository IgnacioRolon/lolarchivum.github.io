I was demoted since I couldn't join those games and now every time that i try I have to wait 10 min to see if the problem is solved or not.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-21T23:54:49.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From your more specific description, it sounds like there may be some sort of weird hardware interaction that is not allowing League to launch or appear correctly.  To hopefully get this resolved, make sure that you complete all of the steps in our [Game Crash Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes#section-mac).  There are quite a few steps there, but they are crucial in hopefully resolving this issue.\n\nLet me know if it doesn't seem to help!","replies":[{"poster":"BobiLord","date":"2016-06-22T04:35:29.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I have done all these steps before posting my first comment here not to mention that I had no problem for a long time until 2 days ago. An update on my situation is that I was able to join the game in my few last tries but the problem is that i am still getting that black screen and message every single time but now when force to quit that black screen (loading screen) and try to reconnect or close the game and reopen a new client and then reconnect after like 10-15 min doing all these I did join the game. the thing is that I have to keep doing all these ( restarting the pc, forcing the quit and reconnecting to the game, closing and reopening the client and reconnecting to the game,...) like 20-30 times with a chance of reconnecting to the game once. \n\nThanks.\n\nps; since with all these problems, I am losing at least half of each game, I was demoted for the third time and now when I want to see if the problem is solved or not I have to wait 20 minutes every time. It would be appreciated if you could help me with the wait time on the lower priority.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-22T20:54:48.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since nothing seems seems to help so far, we are going to need to start digging a little deeper into what could be causing this issue and start pouring over individual logs.
