Remember that you unlocked from getting rewards doesn't mean that you'll 100% get a reward. You still have to play with sportsmanship to earn a key fragment. Remember that those are not free, you have to earn it yourself. I have changed myself, and I'm like the most chill-prove player in the world right now. Maybe you should start to encourage your teammates, and stop them if you see any of the flamings going on. Right now for me, I'm getting a good amount of keys, but not chests... I main tanks so S are so hard to get RIP.  \nJust keep playing nicely, remember you are not playing nice for the key fragments, but for yourself and your teammates. Then I'm pretty sure one day you'll become like me one day xd. {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
