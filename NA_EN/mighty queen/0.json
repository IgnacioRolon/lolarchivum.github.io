You don't get to \"call out\" someone, even if they are legitimate trolls; if you want them punished, you have to use the actual reporting methods - in-Client reports or [Support Tickets](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). If you believe those don't do anything, well, you're shit out of luck, because those are the only avenues you've got.\n\nAnd let me ask you this; what good does \"calling out\" someone on the Boards do? What do you expect us, the community, to do about them? We have no capacity to punish someone, and it's not like we're going to go out of our way to keep track of \"people who someone called trolls\" to avoid playing with them, so, I ask again; _what do you expect us to do?_\n\nAnd this is ignoring the fact that \"evidence\" of someone misbehaving can easily be fabricated.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-05-10T04:30:28.516+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"You agree to the rules of the game, or the boards, when you choose to use the game or the boards.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2019-05-10T04:30:32.563+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Did you specifically name them?
