Riot thus tries the approach of making the targeted spear his signature and different to Nid in that respect, but then it becomes a bit of a problem because Panth's Q is supposed to define his primary strength as well, which means Q has to be both targeted and powerful.\n\nAnd Riot has gotten stuck.\n\nI guess one of the better approach is \"making it count\".
