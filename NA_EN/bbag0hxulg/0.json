Definitely agree on increasing the timer since its going to basically be 'alot faster' since everyone is banning at once then just one person at a time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2017-05-19T21:15:33.712+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"> Update: What happens if people on each team ban a same champion?

Sure you could have banned another champion, so go ahead and ban them instead. You banned the champ you wanted to ban because you felt they were top priority. We get 10 bans so everyone has a voice in the matter, and that voice isn't taken away by someone who agrees with it.

I may not have the final say but I am able to request if that something get banned. I dont have enough strong opinions to think to myself *thank god i dont have to see them again* but if I get double bans on teemo or renekton your bet your ass I will be pissed that I didnt have a chance to ban the other if I am playing something weak toplane who is abused by those two. and that being pissed will turn to outright tilt if the other champion that I would have banned without a wasted ban gets locked in.","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2017-05-20T00:51:59.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I didnt have a chance to ban the other if I am playing something weak toplane who is abused by those two. and that being pissed will turn to outright tilt if the other champion that I would have banned without a wasted ban gets locked in.\n\nOne of them getting through the ban phase is less likely than it was before, and if you get pissed over a ban then maybe work on your anger issues or ban the champ you actually don't want to face. If you don't want to face teemo then ban teemo, but you don't get to decide who the enemy plays. If you are playing a weak laner then you have to expect to get counterpicked in lane, and no reasonable amount of bans is going to fix that.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"I Am The IRS","date":"2017-05-19T21:51:54.459+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"+1","replies":[{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2017-05-19T23:10:04.543+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"why did you guys decide not to allow all ten bans to go through. The idea that if I wanted to ban someone and its already banned feels really shitty IMHO. Especially that any time there is a champion that is overtuned someone has to waste a ban to ensure that the ban sticks, which will result in duplicate bans without any way to safely avoid it unless someone plays that champion and is high up in the pick order. I personally feel like the implementing of this system is very feels bad man for a lot of players in the game would maybe have a few champion that they really dont want to play against will feel shitty about seeing the champion they banned, banned twice.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
