There are a lot of good tank items now that he benefits from, namely the classic Spirit Visage as well as some others, and his W in teamfights can be really handy.  Riot just needs to make top lane towers not made out of paper mache so that nobody, including Trodnomore, can pull off this particularly brainless strategy.

Why is someone like malzahar or tryn considered an anti-fun laner? They aren't particularly strong. In malzahar's case it was said, it's because he's not very \"interactive\". Though now we need to decompress that word a little bit. What does it mean, in a game like league to be \"interactive\". Generally, it's going to be due to him having a low tempo of play, and punishing champions who try to play at a higher tempo of play.\nOther low interactive champions include ones like {{champion:22}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:75}} exc.\n\nSo say that you make these champions which are not very interactive not \"anti-fun\". What would that involve? It would involve removing their ability to punish high tempo play. \nIn which case, you've backed yourself into a corner design wise. You no longer can create low tempo champions, because high tempo is inherently better due to having higher precision of champion control. \nYet, you can't create a high tempo champion which punishes high tempo play, because then their only weakness (being force into low tempo play) have been forced out of the game.\nSo the only real option is to create high tempo champions which don't punish high tempo champions. Which basically just means that the higher tempo champion with the higher impact kit will be superior. \n\nNow, the best solution to this problem would be to make high tempo champions more flexible in their playstyles. The only problem is that riot is actively preventing this by trying to increase class and champion \"identity\", which is directly counter to champion flexibility as it pigeonholes players into fewer play styles per champion.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Silent Gravity","date":"2017-05-07T21:31:48.899+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":3,"body":"If he's so absolutely powerful, you should main him.
