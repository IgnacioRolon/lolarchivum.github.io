Everything starts fine, no errors, it starts patching...Patcher gets to 32% then grinds to an extremely slow speed. takes 20 minutes to get to 33% 20 more to 34% and yet more 20 minutes to get to 35% then it just halts there. I've left it on overnight as well, and I highly doubt write speed is an issue at all, considering this system has a solid state drive.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-23T02:26:19.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't officially support Ubuntu, nor do I personally know very much about that open source OS.
