I had forgot about league until a close friend told me he could still see my account on Lolking which meant it wasn&#039;t deleted thus with effort maybe I could retrive my rights to play the game.\r\n\r\nI&#039;d say I was a really toxic player, was the kind of player that would go head to head against an other toxic player in my own team and really destroy team morale forcing player to DC and the game wasn&#039;t fun for me nor anyone in my games. I would be negative when someone would pick something bad, was toxic when someone wasn&#039;t properly filling his role and generally would be relentless at destroying team spirit.\r\n\r\nI was a player that needed to be banned. I was a player that deserved to be banned.\r\n\r\nThe issue with all of it is that I still had games where I was a good team mate. I had games where people would add me and we would play without issue. I had good time also and it&#039;s worth noting that It wasn&#039;t all bad.\r\n\r\nThe game is , was and still is one of the game I watch closely, I watch it on streams but it&#039;s hurting. I know I&#039;ve been wrong to be so rude.\r\n\r\nLeague of legends isn&#039;t a place for toxicity and it&#039;s not a place to deal with IRL issue either. Ruining the game for everyone isn&#039;t fun for anyone.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nToday I&#039;m in a different place, in a different mood and I&#039;ve grown. I haven&#039;t been toxic in other games. Not once did I get into an argument. Saying that I&#039;ve change would not be fair since I never was a vile individual I was simply blind to the consequence of my words. Blind to the fact that what I was saying could hurt someone. Its easy to insult someone when you don&#039;t see the consequence of your actions.\r\n\r\nI want to have my Pardon. To come back into league and not be that toxic team mate. I want to come back to a game I&#039;ve played for over 4000 hours since season 1 and that I&#039;ve enjoyed the most out of all other game I&#039;ve played. It took a long time for this toxicity to build up in the few early season my chat behavior wasn&#039;t so arrogant and aggressive. I was calm, collected and friendly. Happy to take part in such a great community that was growing so fast. \r\n\r\nI&#039;d say my toxic behavior was coming from IRL issue but also from goal that I could not reach. I was Silver and I simply wanted to reach gold to have rewards at the end of season but It seem to me that I was caught in an endless loop of climbing to Silver 1 and dropping back to Silver 5. I had win streaks of 10 and then lost streaks of 15 it was hard on me. I was trying to find a coherent answer to why I was climbing and dropping and It appeared to me that my team mates were the issue. Which is why It is proven that I&#039;ve been toxic when someone was doing poorly or when picks weren&#039;t in accordance to set meta.\r\n\r\nI know now from a distance that it was all irrelevant what I wanted most was to enjoy a good game of LoL.\r\n\r\nNow I&#039;ve been banned for a Year (a bit more) and I&#039;ve done a ticket but I&#039;m also exposing myself to the community to see how you guys would react. The reform system was proven inefficient but I find it unjust that I can&#039;t have this chance after so long to prove that I know how to play in community without standing out as a loose cannon. \r\n\r\nThank you for reading, feel free to comment anything.\r\n\r\n\r\nWalk\r\nPerm Banned \r\nTop Lane\r\n {{champion:39}}","replies":[{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2017-08-27T08:10:38.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually enjoyed reading this post, it had a feel like none other, like you put all your feelings,\n\n thoughts,and acknowledging yourself alongside others, It was absolutely delightful,\n\n not many people ever get the guts to do that, nor realize the truth around them.\n\nI don't blame you for being toxic, I mean since s6, the game's been in disarray and many have quit due to how frustrating the game's become,\n\nYou learned that the real reason there  is a elohell is because of the difference in experience of the match making system and that the only  way you can succeed is if you can convince your team to follow your sounding lead while being able to help them play better, or play a true hyper carry.\n\ns7 has become a league of 20 min snowball bursts where the adc is the silver platter of getted 1 shotted and you don't ff unless you got a good comp, like another tanky hyper carry with cc, shields galore with people saying ez, begging for reports and blatantly lie when you provided proof just to tilt you, as people respond with will do, question mark you when you die as a joke flashing mastery for right clicking yi to death etc.\n\nOh and if you want some freelo up to diamond, just play {{item:3193}} {{champion:31}} I mean, at most gold since you just 1 shot the adc for +2k true dmg, just league of burst things now I guess.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Whitesmith Kupo","date":"2017-08-24T09:45:45.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've never once heard of a Permaban only being one year.

The game would feel like a chores to start all over again to gather all the pages and to buy back all champion I used to own. Obviously that is without talking about the amount of skin I used to own and some I'll simply won't have the chance to buy back (Kayle blue skin and other legacy)\n\nI'd say if it's the only option it's still better than nothing but if perm ban player are still allowed to make other account the issue isn't resolved.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-08-23T23:56:40.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WalkTheAgony,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=T1vh1ifn,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-08-23T23:47:48.874+0000)\n>\n> Thank you for your comment, I&#x27;d say the thing that keep me from starting all over again is the fact that I lack all my runes and all my champions.
