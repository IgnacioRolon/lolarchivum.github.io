Reason 1)  That is just the type of anime they are because it sells well.  Reason 2)  Filler episodes while waiting for the manga to catch up and they sell well.\n\nMost Naruto fans were watching when there were 100 or less episodes, so they watched them as they came out, not all at once.\n\nIf you want to avoid bikini/beach episode anime you have to look in the less popular side of anime.  Generally things on the more psychological end of the spectrum.  Horror anime have a tendency to avoid it as well as some of the smaller more tasteful anime.\n\nOff the top of my head relating to each of those categories that don't have bikini style episodes there is Serial Experiments Lain (Anime from back in 1998 about how technology was going to influence the world and the merging of internet and real life.  Surprising prophetic although not an easy show to relax to.  Requires a lot of deep thinking.) Another (Book/Manga/Anime ghost story horror thing.  Haven't actually seen the whole anime yet but I know it is very true to the book which I love.)  Tasteful anime that fall closer to the normal end of the spectrum but avoid that stuff include things like Silver Spoon (Romantic Comedy in a quite realistic way.  Really good watch actually because the romance in it is very realistic even if it goes over the top in other areas.)\n\nThere are also anime that just make a joke of it or include it because believe it or not people go to the beach.  Log Horizon is a personal favourite example of this (And just a personal favourite).  Sure there is a beach episode but it directly relates to the story and it takes place at the beach because another location was required to make it work.  The reason it was at a beach was due to there being a training camp near the ocean and one of the side characters who had a role in organizing it very much being the type of person who would detour for that.  Log Horizon also isn't afraid to use sexual themes in a fairly realistic way because people are attractive, and there are people who use that attractiveness.","replies":[{"poster":"HeimerLmao","date":"2017-02-01T13:42:17.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought that Ao No Exorcist has no beach episodes...
