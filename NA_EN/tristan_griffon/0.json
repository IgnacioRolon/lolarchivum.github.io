I was able to sign into the client and play games. Now, 12 hours later, trying to sign in just tells me there was an error while trying to sign me in. There was no message about being locked out of my account, or that my account details were incorrect; there was just an error. I'm certain nothing changed between those 12 hours, so this is quite the mystery to me... I'd appreciate any help I can get, as I'd like to play a game or two with my brother today.\n\nEdit: Alright, it let me in. And after running the Hextech Repair Tool, it's running just fine again. So, um... Disregard this post? ^.^'","replies":[{"poster":"Oksanaandjoy","date":"2017-05-17T13:43:44.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem.
