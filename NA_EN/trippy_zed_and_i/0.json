This isn't helping your case as to why you shouldn't have gotten a chat restriction.\n\n> Trippy Zed and I: lmao\n> Trippy Zed and I: thats y u dont over extend\n\nSo rather than be constructive, you laugh at your team and act condescendingly towards them. Again not helping your case.\n\n> Trippy Zed and I: w t f\n> Trippy Zed and I: wtf\n> Trippy Zed and I: yasuo so fucking blind jesus christ\n\nFlaming your teammate. Not helping either.\n\n> Trippy Zed and I: we lost this fucking game useless garbage fucking game\n\nBlaming your teammate and flaming your teammate.

Whether it's 25 games or 10 games, you deserve a chat restriction. Your title also indicates more evidence of your toxic behavior. \n\nMy suggestion is to stop insulting people, stop flaming people, stop being sarcastic, be constructive, promote teamwork, and foster a cooperative environment. \n\nMaking people hate you in game doesn't make you win more when you have to depend on them cooperating with you and working with you as a team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sagademon","date":"2019-10-13T11:48:34.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You literally just showed us evidence as to why your ban is valid","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rouxful","date":"2018-08-02T15:21:48.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is clearly a smurf account right?
