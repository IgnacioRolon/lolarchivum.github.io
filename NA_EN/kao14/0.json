According to many different sites like op.gg and leagueofgraphs, he has a 46% winrate with below a 3% playrate. Only mains are playing him and even then they are having abysmal success. Champions with such low playrates shouldn&#039;t have such awful winrates (take Aurelion Sol for example, who&#039;s also only played by a few but has a high winrate). I barely even see him played at all anymore; I think the last time he was in one of my games was a month ago (and I play a lot). \r\n\r\nRiot has been silent after his small q and ult cd buffs even though he&#039;s still struggling. Does Riot think he&#039;s fine at the moment? Or do they have bigger changes planned for him and are unsure how to buff him in his current state? I&#039;m genuinely curious, because Viktor is one of my favorite champions to play, but he feels so weak at the moment, and I feel disheartened that Riot hasn&#039;t mentioned him after his last (small) buff that didn&#039;t address any of his massive weaknesses/what makes him unsatisfying to play (all the delays in his kit).\r\n\r\nI hope a Rioter will at least see this, or better yet share their thoughts. Also I hope this post doesn&#039;t come across as a bitter rant, but rather concern from a huge champion enthusiast.","replies":[]}
