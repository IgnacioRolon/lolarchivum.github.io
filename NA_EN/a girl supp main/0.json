Whether it actually happens or not is a coin toss, though.\n\nIf this happened in a game, yes, it is reportable, under hate speech (if he was saying bad things about people of a specific gender) or harassment (if he was specifically targeting you for inappropriate chat messages that you didn't like) or both (if you feel the two were related).\n\nAs you say, it doesn't at all excuse this kind of behavior, but you can indeed mute it, and I would definitely recommend doing so if someone's chat messages are bothering you.

I also agree with what the other person said mute early if something someone is saying is making you uncomfortable. There is bming and just shit talking but once it gets to a point tell them to stop if they dont mute. Its what I do when people start to get toxic or out of line with what they are saying.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FÃ«alnort","date":"2019-07-01T16:47:22.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I always think that \"gamer being assholes to girls\" was a bit  of a stereotype.\n\nThen i see post like thise one with 3 asshole downvoting it for .. reasons ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jennifer420","date":"2019-07-01T10:42:33.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"well... a ticket is such a weird thing you know.\nin my 9 years of league i made over 50 tickets about a guy spamming kys in a chatroom (yeah, these things that existed before clans) and he never got any punishement, he still plays to this day. so my opinion of tickets = they are totally fucking useless.\n\nbut for whatever reason about ~ 1 year ago the boards started to say to submit tickets again. i dont know why, so far i saw ONE thread of someone being able to show that his ticket did something. so imo they are useless. but the majority of the board keeps saying they arent useless.\n\nin the end its not even 5min of work so decide for yourself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aladoron","date":"2019-07-01T11:34:32.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"How can anybody talk to you for 30mins if you mute them after the first?
