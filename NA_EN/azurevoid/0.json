Full AP football star Malphite is just crazy in URF. Even AP Jarvan or AP Aatrox worked in URF. Imagine being able to buy 6 boots and have 700 ms. Or 5 bloodthirsters and just having nonstop heal. 2 ROA and 3 Archangels staff on Kassadin for the insane amounts of AP. 3 Runaans on anyone because AOE ADCs. Getting crushed by a Rengar? Get 2 Zhonya&#039;s and 3 Sunfires. Untargetable free damage over time. Will nearly everything be broken? Yes, but its the same way in urf. 4 WOTA&#039;s on a lux is just how this gamemode would roll, just like how URF has AP Lucian and One For All the team of Cassiopeias. I would love to see this in the new weekly gamemodes since it would change the pace. If any of you can think of a crazy build on any champ, post the items and the champs in the comments.
