Only with League","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I started a game a few hours ago and there were no health bars being displayed. I tried de-selecting and re-selecting show hp bars, but it didn't help. I alt tabbed to look it up online and I couldn't get back into the game. I ctrl+alt+delete'd and it said league wasn't responding so I ended the task and loaded the game back up. Was able to finish the game and started another.\r\n\r\nAbout half way through I d/c'd and could not reconnect. I had no idea what happened but was able to re-log so I started up another queue.\r\n\r\nI made it to champ select but then d/c'd just as the last person was locking in their champ. I thought it was a pending Windows Update, so I ran the update then got back into the client. I saw that it marked the game as a remake and me as the leaver. So (now thinking the issue was resolved) I just went back into queue.\r\n\r\nWhen I went to select my champion it said something along the lines of \"There was an error selecting your champion. Try again in a bit\". Now it is treating me as if I dodged queue and I have to wait before getting back into queue. My internet is fine (other websites and apps work) and I checked the server status and it said nothing was wrong, not to mention I can get INTO champ select, but then everything goes wrong.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on what I could do to resolve this?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-21T04:15:12.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would definitely start with some general network troubleshooting, as it sounds like your network isn't reliably able to communicate with our servers if you keep getting randomly disconnected or unable to maintain a solid connection through champion select. First check out your firewalls and antivirus as they might be blocking the client from making it's connections, but also be sure to check out the other steps listed in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) just to be sure you check off the basics first, as it's not entirely uncommon for your network to be able to reach some servers but not others (just from how the internet functions as a whole).","replies":[{"poster":"ParkerDrake","date":"2017-12-21T04:46:30.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, it started working again (idk how), but I will keep that in mind for next time!","replies":[]}]}]}
