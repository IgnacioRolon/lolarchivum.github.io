Yes it is nice to have a champion that can get rolling and snowball like crazy but usually snowbally champions are good duelists. In bronze games rarely end before 35-40 minutes (unless surrendered). What that means is that a champion with a lot of utility is usually going to be more useful because they will have an impact at all points in the game. Hardly any one in bronze knows how to snowball a lead properly and if they do they probably will climb out of bronze very fast. Thus I do not think the idea of playing snowbally champs is very accurate. Instead you should play team fighting champs and be better at them then any one else at your level that way you can snowball and then have a substantial impact when the late game rolls around. Champs like annie are particularly good at this. \n\nBasically the best advice I can give someone in bronze is pick a champion you like and a champion you like in a different role and only play those 2 champions. Before you know it you won't have to worry about your machanical skills and can instead focus on winning and  objectives and position and all the core elements of the game that are usually not practiced in bronze level play.","replies":[{"poster":"Beoridas","date":"2015-04-24T18:07:21.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i already suggested annie.

Thats all that matters. dont assume they dont know how to snowball or no one knows how to win. now the argument can be made about snowballing  **_properly_**. But you see, that was two or three of my points. People sometimes read what they want to read and dont look at it as a whole. \n\n6. Value obj and be proactive with pings, dont think how nice your full build would be, think about how you can end the game and do it!\n7. develop a good team fight sense. is it better to poke? to go in? who to focus? should you defend your adc? should you team fight at all?\n\nlike people think that its a one trick ponie, ohh look play a snowball champ and gg...cmon man...i made 12 points. not one! now you mentioned a champ with utility..\n\nso you would suggest orianna or karma to a bronze 5? you kidding? \nall the advices you said, i already said it\n\n4. **_learn all possible positions_** and **_play snowbally_** champs that doesnt depend on your ally to get rolling.\n\nYou said not to play a snowball champ....you serious? you dont want him to play champs that can win lane, win trades,  and teach him out to get ahead and carry? what if his team is super behind...whats the point to team fight with a fatty champ that is behind or at the same level than his lane....what if hes behind since he cant snowball, or cant be ahead?\n\nthe bottom line was this: you want to **_TEACH_** him how to get out the best way possible and to **_LEARN_**. hes never going to learn by telling him: oh well man, all games end up late, well cause yall suck, so take a late game champ anyway...thats like the WORST you could tell him. Nothing hes gonna learn from that. Specially telling him about team fights which is usually not the right approach to win in every circumstances. Sometimes split push is in order, sometimes poking. a good part of his games, his team will be behind or one lane will be. Its solo queue: YOU have to carry out of your elo with YOUR skills. Id rather tell him to pick champs that gets ahead and win (and doesnt need mechanics, positining and other fed lanes) cause he will have more options.","replies":[{"poster":"Sammystorm","date":"2015-04-24T18:30:26.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never said people don't know how to snowball in bronze because they do. They do not know how to snowball properly. Basically what it boils down to that the person is in bronze because they are lacking specific important mechanics. SO instead of telling them to play champions they are unfamiliar with/ may not even like. Show them how to be good at their favorite champion in the proper role. If that is Orianna then so be it. If that is Kat that is fine too. Once they get to a point of mastery with the champion they won't have to worry about playing the champion and instead will learn the important stuff like positioning and objectives. SO if your goal is to teach them: having them play snowbally champs really isn't the best way. If you are just trying to help them get out of bronze snowbally champions are probably the best. If you really wanted to teach them how to be a better player you would start with how to play a specific champion. Then move on from their. You don't just start teaching people random things that they can't implement because their skill with a champion is too low to actually complete the task you asked of them.","replies":[{"poster":"Beoridas","date":"2015-04-24T18:43:29.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think you are either not taking my post as a whole, or you arent trying to understand the heart behind the post. \n\nlook, i understand people wont like necessarily the champs ive mentioned. but there is still a reality check behind it. there is also more than one. but 10. and all different in their role and gameplay. so he can choose.","replies":[{"poster":"Sammystorm","date":"2015-04-24T18:53:22.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They flat out are not different in their game style.

A support usually is significantly harder to carry out of bronze as but still doable.\n\nThe game is highly complex yes but people need to start learning somewhere and by learning strategies like split pushing and giving them equal value as team fighting is just absurd. Team fights happen in basically every game in league and are vastly more common then any other strategy. So it makes complete sense to talk about team fights and champions role in team fights.\n\nI also know a tremendous amount of people who can't or couldn't get out of bronze well playing snowbally champs. I also know plenty of people who made it out of bronze playing tanks. Me included. Your stats don't really matter for the topic at hand and using \"I know people\" is a really bad argument because you can say whatever the hell you want and I have no way to verify it.

Champs that are great in team fights struggle because your team is so disorganised that if they are not at your level, you won't go up to silver.\nBut champs that can shine on their own, CAN carry a team, not because they can 1v5, but because the enemy team is equally disorganised and struggle to stop that 11 kill Yi no matter how many times they try.

You're going to need more than luck to 1v5 with someone like malzahar or urgot. I could be wrong here but if I'm not mistaken your reply is to a reply I made regarding fiora, riven, poppy, and annie. If I'm mistaken then feel free to disregard this post.\n\nThose four champions can hard carry a game and it's possible for them to win fights that they have no business getting close to where others would simply die a quick painful death. Aatrox and darius could also be on that list. Going through the list these champions excel at either \n1) nuking people(fiora, riven, darius) to the point where it doesn't matter how many people you bring, it only matters if they walked into a death bush or not. Those three can 100-0 nearly any non-tank in about a second. both fiora and riven have really low cooldowns also so they can repeat as needed until they ace or finally die. darius just dunks.\n\n2) How the hell am I alive champions. poppy is a prime example of this one and to some degree annie. Poppy(I really love poppy) can live through fights no other champion can with her broken as hell passive and ult you can run into a 1v5 and if you can find a good ult target dismember any damage dealers on their team then clean up the tanks or force them to flee. Annie can do this also to some degree but you gotta get a surprise tibbers on it. baron and dragon pit are two places she can easily erase the back line then walk away from anyone left alive stunning as needed. This is what I meant by luck. positioning and choke points.\n\nNow to avoid any confusion if any of these champs get caught out or death bushed they are likely to fall over dead(except poppy). But they can cause enough damage and disruption to pull off fights that are heavily stacked against them. These are simply champions that can carry hard and don't require the rest of your team to make something happen.\n\nAlso I make no claim that this list is complete but in my own experience these are champions to learn if you want to carry a game. They all scale into late game  and have the potential to win games single handedly. I'm down in the muck of bronze and teamwork is not something we excel at. If you want out you must carry unless you get insanely lucky and have a team that works together. If they do that then by all means stay and fight by their side. I personally can't carry my way out yet but I'm working on it.\n\nSorry for rambling. Sleep deprivation is a bitch.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"T RexHasLongLegs","date":"2015-04-24T02:44:47.716+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This guy made a really good post.

I used to have a tune page for it but deleted it bc I never really played it and don't like it.\n\nAlso I would say learn stuff you are good at making the best of. I play heimer almost 70% of games and he isn't a snowball champ and my win % with him is really good.

Assume it is always your fault when you lose no matter how bad your team and look for what you could have done better.

So he depends on the enemy's mistakes or engages, then the rest is conditional. thats too risky imo.

Other than that its Adcs, jungle, mid lane. in order. at lower elos its getting ahead and how to manage that advantage. which a support cannot do in anyway shape of form.  a support is better at limiting your team's mistakes or protecting the advantage your team has.

I was just saying that you NEED to know how to play it decently. There are people who will say they don't know how to support or aren't good at it when they are last pick, and you know what, they are often getting it anyway. If you cannot play support well enough that you aren't holding your team back that's an issue because it is something you WILL have to play at some point. All though I would argue that support type champs can be really good to carry with. S3 Nunu was really strong in the jungle and he is definitely a support style jungle but he carried my bad self to gold (which is the only time I made gold, and him and Janna were probably the only champs I could play to the level that I would do well or decent in a gold mmr game). \n\nIt is as much about what you play well as it is about what is strong is the perspective I was trying to bring. If you're a good adc or w/ the champs you mentioned they are probably the BEST way to get higher rank when compared to all the play styles and champs you could pick from. If you aren't though don't feel like you have to do it if you don't want to learn that style or don't like it. People don't learn as well in an unhappy mindset so it is important to enjoy your champ bc the hormones and brain chemicals released actually make it easier to learn. I love heim and objective control, plus my mechanics are the worst part of my game but if I'm not too sleepy I can make calls decently and make decent decisions (picking the right heimer ult for the fight makes him amazingly versatile and is what lets him fit almost any team comp) so heimer is easier for me to win w/ than regular carry champs. Plus in bronze and silver there are so many bad plays it is easy to take advantage of them, and heim can be played to master even if it isn't as easy as other champs (phasekiller is a korean heimer main who is master this season and was challenger last and Heisendong is a NA heimer main who is D1 or master).\n\nI think you make a really good point about what the easiest way to carry low elo games is. For me though it is important to note that if you aren't good at those champs or don't like other styles you can pretty easily do the same thing w/ other champs, you just may have to be better at them than w/ the ones you listed to get to the same rank. However, I guarantee you my heimer is stronger than my skill w/ any champ you listed because I enjoy him and am willing to put in the practice and watching streams and stuff to get better w/ him and I wouldn't with others. Thus why I think that picking something you like to focus on is often better than picking what is best, because bronze is easy enough you can win with anything if you put in the time to get pretty good w/ it.","replies":[{"poster":"Beoridas","date":"2015-04-24T06:45:53.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sure. just not as optimal. frankly, i didnt use these champs to climb out of bronze either. but it was in season 2.  it goes back to my point that someone should be able to do all roles.\n\n4, **learn all possible positions** and play snowbally champs that doesnt depend on your ally to get rolling.","replies":[{"poster":"Sammystorm","date":"2015-04-24T08:26:45.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't even think that is right.

So yes, if he wants to learn every perspective, understand his team's needs, the bigger picture, he needs to learn the game from every angle. its very rare that someone will get to play their 1-2 roles up to diamond 3+.  Once you are at very high elo, THEN its very important to be a god like in one or two roles. I am a far superior player because i understand what the team need from every point of view and every section of the map than if i didnt. when i jungle, because ive been midlaning a lot, i know when and where to gank and why.
