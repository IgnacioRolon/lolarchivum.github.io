Every single champion that has a dash can currently cc cancel displacements. And there are some dashes like poppy e that can currently cancel lee sin r completely by just input buffering her e once he gets in your range. (also if you didn't know, You can flash any type of displacement ability and it wont move you if timed correctly. Such as poppy Ultimate.)\nSo i'm going to basically correct some of the information that got spread here recently by uninformed players. \n\n1.\"She has a known, extremely game-changing bug that is relatively easy to do, and people are abusing it. \"\n\nFalse. Not even challenger riven players are able to abuse this bug reliably because it has to be frame perfect for it to work and its also so extremely situational that you would only use this 1 out of 300 games. Most of the time you would kill yourself for trying to accomplish this bug( not exaggerating) \n\n2.\"Riven is not just causing issues with displacement effects on dashing. This is not a hook/pull/knockback only issue. She is able to remove any and all forms of CC.\"\n\nAgain incorrect info. The only cc that can be canceled by the use of dashes is displacements and knockups with 2 parts of cc.(Again this dash bug can be replicated with every single champion with a dash. I REPEAT ITS NOT EXCLUSIVE TO RIVEN)\n\n3.\" Ez still gets cc after his teleport.Riven totally remove any cc.\" \n\nRiven and any other champion that uses this bug will still be cced through it since you still see the cc bar on top of the champions.\n\n\nTL'DR.  EVERY champion with a dash can do this bug Stop spreading false information because a riven rekt you. Sincerely a challenger player.\n\n\nPosts i got linked \n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/LjX1bWNy-in-all-seriousness-why-isnt-riven-disabled\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/BZQBX3V0-for-the-love-of-god-fix-riven-already\n\n\nAlso if riot wants to know more information on how this bug works feel free to let them know to message me.","replies":[{"poster":"Mira Arya Enthe","date":"2017-01-19T08:16:54.192+0000","up_votes":99,"down_votes":5,"body":"Wooooooooo!

It can't be because the meta right now is early-game-centric with a focus on snowballing that explains why champions like Lee and Vi are popular on a given patch, it has to be because they're ridiculous (notice that often Vi is a good pick whenever Lee is, for basically the same reasons). If the meta favors them then of course they're going to be popular, that's how the design of a MOBA will work - you can't blame the champion for being played to its strengths, that results in what happened to Sejuani during the Cinderhulk era where she gets nerfed, then what actually made her seem problematic (along with other champions) got nerfed, and then she was left to dry after her time in the cucking stool. You change the focus of the meta, you can change what champions will be popular without doing as much alteration to the champions themselves. \n\nCirclejerks (and thus the Gameplay boards) are where logic goes to die, buried in a sea of undeserved upvotes.","replies":[{"poster":"Elikain","date":"2017-01-19T20:12:00.753+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it a meme that Memes & Games board is actually a better place for balance discussions?\nI frequent the Gameplay board a lot and i, most of the times, have to play the contrarian to these circlejerk threads.

Sometimes a champion is mostly just strong because there's a few things in particular right now that favor them, but if they're being favored by those things then odds are very high that they're favoring other champions as well, which helps to shape the current meta, which means you would likely accomplish more by balancing those extraneous things than the champions that weren't considered problematic until those few things were bent into their favor. \n\nThis happens in DotA2 as much as it happens in League, so I have plenty of experience with looking at things from multiple angles to try and draw a more reasonable conclusion.","replies":[{"poster":"Elikain","date":"2017-01-19T23:24:24.272+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the point.\nPeople just don't want to admit they don't have all the facts, they try to push through their own opinions as solid facts and act like Riot should balance the game according their beliefs.

And it just pisses me off how ignorant they are. I don't regard myself as being right all the time but i am there to challenge their point of view and force them to consider a different one. If the balance of the game was up to them, we'd be up shit's creek in a single patch.
