Having the option to invite other players will be a great impact to those who are wood, new to the game or for Vandiril, find bugs. Having a dummy was a nice idea as it tells you how much damage you are dealing, for example, a full {{champion:238}} combo. However we all know that the enemy isn't gonna stand still and take damage (unless they DC). If you think that this mode will be taken advantage of, playing it as URF, as Vandiril said, limit the players or maybe limit the time allowed. As mentioned, this would bring a great benefit to League of Legends gameplay... and can stop the flaming in game.{{summoner:14}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"MasterOfMetaI","date":"2017-04-26T23:43:15.804+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"love your vids man, keep up the bug finding\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/kIyBc0W9fUo/maxresdefault.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2017-04-27T17:32:04.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Has Riot started paying you yet?
