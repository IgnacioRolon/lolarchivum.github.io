(Ranked Rant)","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"I&#039;m about sick of this happening in ranked. Everything seems fine in lobby when champ selecting, no fights or anything until you get into the actual game. True story. \n\nI played ranked yesterday, trying to get Bronze II since I have 100 pts, I already won one of the games but lost this one, and here&#039;s the reason why. \n\nIt was Mundo top, Rengar jungle, Lux Mid (Me) and Braum/Draven bot. Game just started and everything seems fine until the enemy jungler (Lee Sin) decides to counter jungle (I was expecting this) I leave my lane to help Rengar and he doesn&#039;t want to leave his blue buff, wanting me to have it at level 2...now some mid&#039;s would like this but I kindly turned it down, when i notice Lee going for him I rush over to help. He&#039;s low and just after escaping decides to run back in jungle to his blue with now both Kassadin and Lee in his jungle. I had left to farm since I missed a lot trying to save him from Lee. He run to blue while I get pincered against my turret from Lee and Kassadin trying to kill me (since I was low) I manage to dodge most of their skill shots but rengar keeps insisting on his blue buff WITH BOTH OF THEM STILL THERE. So of course he hands first blood to Lee Sin then proceeds to call out not only myself but top lane for &quot;not helping him&quot; &quot;you guys suck I&#039;m feeding&quot; ....he then proceeds to walk down my lane and feed Kassadin including everyone else while me and the other 3 human beings on my team decide to ignore rengar and work together to try and 4v5 with rengar constantly feeding and being outright toxic and abusive to my team saying this was only his second account and he didn&#039;t give a fuck if we were losing our climb, promos, etc.\n\nAll was not lost, the enemy team along with my own reported this rengar child and moments later I got a Tribunal note saying he was punished. Whatever.\n\nThe point is, I&#039;m tired of this happening, I haven&#039;t been able to climb out of Bronze because of people like this and I hate it when people say &quot;It&#039;s so easy to get out of Bronze, maybe you just belong there cause you suck, LOL&quot;  \n\nI&#039;m tired of that excuse because it makes no sense to me how honest people who unfortunately end up in Bronze because of players who just feed because they can. Season 5 was just a clusterfuck of my friends and people who I just meet in normals or ranked who ended up in bronze because of some toxic child who didn&#039;t get his way, etc. \n\nI don&#039;t know the outcome but I hope placement for next season is better....A LOT better. Because this is rediculous to the point of many people leaving your game Riot because nothing is being done about these toxic people who outright ruin games for people who enjoy it for what it is...A GAME NOT A COMPETITION. Leave that in the LCS please. I  realize they can&#039;t do much but at least try something small to make it less of a problem...","replies":[{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2015-11-02T07:17:34.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh you shouldn't play lux in bronze. It's so much easier to carry as a assassin or burst mage like annie or veigar. That being said, that decision of helping rengar early screwed you over. There was nothing you could do to save him. Focus mostly on yourself. Farm up and carry. Let your team do their own thing. It sounds dumb but it's true. In bronze you just get a leaf and snowball. Enemy team doesn't know how to deal with it. That doesn't mean get fed then try to 1v5. Play smart and snowball as hard as you can. Keep drag control, do baron asap and group and end when you see a chance. If you play mid I recommend learning ahri,annie,veigar, and leblanc. Just farm and roam for kills and you'll carry your ass to silver  (;","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeloricVI","date":"2015-11-02T05:37:41.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've lost games to people like this, and I've even won some (when they didn't go full out \"I'm feeding now because I don't like you\") but the going was really hard. If they would just cooperate and settle down, sometimes the game was totally winable. Hell, it probably is every time these people try this crap, until they start feeding intentionally. There should be much more strict rules about this in ranked, imo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oksanaandjoy","date":"2015-11-02T05:18:00.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's an idea: after being punished for this sort of behaviour you get placed in ranks full of other who do the same. Behave yourself and you can come back to where the cool people play.

I get them just as often in Plat as I did when I was in Silver. The best case scenario would be if Riot could create some magical system that got rid of most of them, but until then your options really are to just put up with it, or stop playing ranked. If you're willing to put up with it, then just keep playing the game. Eventually, you'll be able to climb. Leavers and trolls are just as likely to be on the other team as they are on yours, so as long as you play your best and deserve to be in a higher rank, then you'll be able to climb.\n\nA few days ago I got 2 leavers back to back. Sure it sucked, but I just kept playing and sure enough a few games later I had another 2 games back to back where the ENEMY has players DC. It's human nature to always remember the bad times more than the good, so I recommend that while playing ranked just try to focus on yourself. YOU are the only factor you can truly control. If someone leaves, no need to rage over something you have no control over. It's like getting pissed off that it's raining. You could rage out about it, but it's pointless since you can't do anything about it. Just gotta do what you can, and weather the storm.","replies":[]},{"poster":"fééd l0rd","date":"2015-11-02T02:24:29.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can climb out of bronze in one day.. toxic people are also in silver/gold/plat/dia/master and even in challenger if you believe it or not. on this account ( my 2nd smurf) i said to myself that i just want to play roles like support or jungle to improve. on my main account im an adc main and i can play also mid but every other lane.. i suck haha.\nso i just von like 5 games of 10 and got placed in silver 5 and stopped playing for months. then i came back and said fuck it i will play the role i will get and after 2 more weaks i reached gold EASILY ( want those rewards cause i will not get them on my main for sure ). \n\nthe point is you will have trolls in your games and they are making it hard to climb, but if you are good enough you will get out of bronze, silver and out of gold without any afford.. keep attention to your own gameplay and try to improve.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VazEzren","date":"2015-11-02T02:06:53.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've always found it interesting seeing all these people talking about the toxicity in bronze. for me the toxicity is way worse in silver. I climbed out of Bronze 3 to Silver 5 this season, only took me about 20-30 games I think. Toxicity was rare in my bronze experience, even when people were playing badly other teammates of mine weren't being too harsh(although I did see toxicity on the enemy team a number of times).\n\nLast season though, I got placed in Silver 4. I was so happy thinking I had dodged the toxicity of Bronze. However I spent the next few months going back and forth between Silver 5 and 4 because I'd get team after team of people just like the one you described. Sometimes there would even be up to 3 people intentionally feeding/refusing to communicate/afk. Then you'd have the players who are super arrogant and think they're the best in the game just because they got placed in silver and not bronze. I'd have games where there were toxic players on both teams in Silver rank and it'd become a race to see which team could feed the hardest. I had 2 idiots one game playing \"league football\", which is where you try and run to the enemy fountain turret without getting touched.\n\nThis season I got back into Silver after only having to redo my promos twice. I figured, \"Well that sucked but I guess it wasn't too bad, might as well try a few silver games. What's the worst that could happen right? Worst case scenario I lose a couple games and call it done for this season before I drop down to bronze again.\" I played 2 games, and those 2 games were the most infuriating ranked games I've played all season. Even had a 3rd game I queued for and the toxicity was full blown in the lobby, people were just randomly instalocking champs on my team just to piss each other off. Thankfully someone dodged and that was when I decided I'll save ranked for next season.\n\nIn my experience a lot of the bronze players I came across understood they had room for improvement because they were bronze. Most of them were just trying to get out of bronze and learn to get better. For some stupid reason though everyone I meet in silver thinks they were screwed over by the placement system and believes they belong in diamond. These people can't be reasoned with and if you tell them they are wrong on something they ignore you and do something stupid, if you prove them wrong they go full blown radioactive-toxic.\n\n I wish you luck with your climb out of bronze, but take it from someone who's been silver for 2 seasons now, it doesn't get any easier. I don't play a lot of ranked anymore because I feel like I need anger management or chemotherapy afterwards. So in my opinion, bronze ain't half as bad as silver, but everybody gets different experiences I guess.\n\nGood luck and happy gaming!\n-Vaz-","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2015-11-01T23:44:09.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel bad for people stuck in Bronze :( my own climb out of Bronze in i believe Season 3 went pretty smoothly actually. Season 4 i failed my promos for Gold V about 7-8 times until i plummeted down to Silver 4 and quit. This season im trying to at least hit Silver I again, but its hard the other day i failed my promos for Silver II 4 times in a row :(   \n\nWhat's my point? It is not just Bronze, those people are in Silver and probably all the way up to Platinum. Do not get discouraged remember with all these troubles and roadblocks it just means getting to Gold (or just out of Bronze) is going to feel that much better and you will know it was on your own skill. Good luck and stay positive.","replies":[{"poster":"Z46","date":"2015-11-02T01:21:02.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assholes exist as high as Diamond and Challenger. No elo is safe from poor attitudes, trolls and people clawing at each other's throats. It becomes statistically less frequent the higher you go just by virtue of how much of the League population inhabits Bronze and how much it narrows down as you climb, but it never disappears.","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2015-11-02T01:33:45.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm ye im sure there is always that one guy who just doesn't care if they win or lose. I just assumed it was less frequent at Diamond and above due to the amount of people and skill level like you said. Most people do it at lower elo because they are not very good but think that they are or perhaps they know they are not that good, either way they take it out on other people. I wonder what motives a Diamond or Challenger troll would have... hmm interesting.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ToughFluffs","date":"2015-11-01T23:35:25.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate to say it but I was right where you were before.\nI just recently climbed out of bronze, and yeah, it's not easy.

Even if things are going terrible, shake it off. Laugh it off. Remember that even if it's ranked, it's still just a game. When all is said and done, you can walk away from the computer and live your life, and be better off for it. \nBut again, stay positive. Praise your teammates.

It's usually more important to be with your team in case something happens and they need you than to be taking objectives alone and letting them be put at risk of a 4v5.\n\nAnd yeah, some games are just unwinnable.
