If someone does something that violates the rules, just report them yourself and move on - it's not the amount of reports per game that ends up determining whether or not a a player gets punished (or perhaps considered for punishment, not sure which), but rather the number of games they get reported _in_.\n\nPersonally I would consider your attitude in your log to be annoying (that's quite a lot of chatting for one game, by the way), but not permaban-worthy. You're a bit passive-aggressive with your teammates.

You say GG a few times too many, also you are WAY too active in the chat.  Yeah you did the right thing in muting your toxic teammates, but dont egg it on with other teammates.
