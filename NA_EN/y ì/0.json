I was asking for 22 RP, in which I would send a poem to them in return. I replied to the person who asked for the poem in return for some RP, and since then, I have been waiting for about 2 days for a response! Is this an average wait time for a type of ticket like this? I would like to get this RP as soon as possible!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-27T20:50:32.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this for you, and it looks like the ticket was accidentally returned to our billing team's queue.
