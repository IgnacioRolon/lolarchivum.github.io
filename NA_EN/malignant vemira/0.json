He was complaining about your game choices, so you find it okay to try to potentially destroy his career. Who is the real toxic person here?\n\n1. If you read PB regularly you could see occasionall complaints about feeders and people getting banned for calling some1 out for feeding. And according to the community, calling some1 out for feeding is considered harrassment and it is punishable.\n\n2. I don't care about stuff like this (I dont mind toxicity in general) but if it was a regular player in question, the majority of players would agree this is toxic and should be bannable. But when rioter does it, every1 turns a blind eye it seems. Riot created the rules, so it makes sense that they should follow these rules, right?\n\n3. No1 is trying to destroy the career of that rioter. But the thing is, if players see that rioters are calling people out on feeding, they might do that aswell, cuz if they're doing it, then it's fine right? And that might result in more toxicity, the thing that player HAAAAATE. So if anything that rioter should aknowledge this and at least apologise.\n\ntl;dr it's no big deal by itself, but it sends a bad message.","replies":[{"poster":"xMFGODx","date":"2018-12-10T15:22:51.305+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":5,"body":"Let me define this for you straight from Google so we can get on the same page of what toxic is. \"Toxic: capable of causing serious harm to a person's health and wellbeing. ...

So again I say learn how to use that word properly. Having mistakes pointed out helps you learn. When yo go to your job and you make a mistake do you report your boss for pointing it out?

I have a more direct solution: If you can show me a chat log, posted on these boards in its entirety, of a player being punished for similar logs, in a single game, as defined by at least some third-party interpretation by our peers on these boards... I'll personally request that I be banned from the boards for a month. You've got my word on that. Note that absent personal punishment history information I'm giving you a LOT of leeway here to find somebody on very thin ice.","replies":[{"poster":"SonicAF","date":"2018-12-10T13:54:17.367+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jo0o,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=KeZLXXXH,comment-id=001f000000010000000000000000,timestamp=2018-12-10T13:41:03.072+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s a couple lines of text.

People never get their punishment removed if their reform card contains much milder behaviour if it can be perceived as negative.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TaLkSiK4u","date":"2018-12-10T09:42:21.372+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":6,"body":"14 deaths with no success?
