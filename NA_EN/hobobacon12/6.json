I am honor 3 and have been for a few months. Many of my friends are honor 4 and 5 and I'm confused. I play a lot more than them and get honored almost every game and honor someone almost every game. I guess it is possible that people have reported me for being toxic when I get a little annoyed (I sometimes say things like \"my team can't even look at the map\" or other useless things that I say that I shouldn't, but never things like \"uninstall\" or kill \"yourself.\") If someone could help me with this It would be very appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-15T20:40:54.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like your honor is still progressing at the normal rate! Keep in mind though, even if you don't get punished some reports might hold a little weight even if you don't immediately get punished for something.","replies":[{"poster":"HoboBacon12","date":"2017-10-15T20:50:35.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, thanks","replies":[]}]}]}
