I asked if my honor progress was bugged, and a riot member said it was working normally. I've been getting honored a lot lately, and I have been playing a good amount too. Not sure if I lose progress from being reported, sometimes when I accidentally steal a kill or just play jg and don't gank of of the lanes people get mad at me and report me for no reason other than that. Either my progress is bugged or people are reporting me for no reason. I don't really care if I cant get high honor this season, but I don't wan't it to be bugged next season and prevent me from getting high honor. Thanks for the help with other bugs in the past, this probably isn't one but I'm just confused.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-01T01:47:40.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup, still no bugs here. You're still earning honor at the normal rate and you're rank 3. Again, the thing to keep in mind is that your progress is your own, and shouldn't be compared to others. It's also worth noting that even though recent behavior might not have punished you, your behavior is still being tracked. Looks like there was at least one game where you might have been less than honorable, which is most likely weighing you down.","replies":[{"poster":"HoboBacon12","date":"2017-11-04T23:53:55.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I know you are probably busy, but I really like the detail you tell me when things happen, was wondering if you could possibly take a look at the discussion that I put up a couple of hours ago, I'm very confused right now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quackas","date":"2017-11-01T15:34:33.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thing is without feedback how do we know that we ARE being less than honorable enough to progress in honor levels?\n\nLike if I get honored by 3/4 on my team but then justifiably reported by the 1/4 other person how does that effect my honor? Was I honorable that game or dishonorable? \n\nThe one report isn't enough cause to issue a penalty like chat restrict or ban but it's enough to effect honor level without us even knowing that we got dinged for saying something like\n\nMake me!  to a teammate the tells me to STFU!
