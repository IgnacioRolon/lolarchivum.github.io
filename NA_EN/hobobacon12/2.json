I wasn't punished, banned, or anything. I kind of find it stupid that you guys will just take my honor and not tell me why. Please someone tell me why my honor just got reset for no reason, I'm not even toxic, and the games I get annoyed and get a tiny bit toxic is when my entire team is toxic to me and I say something back to shut them up, and because I do that, my entire team reports me for saying one thing. I've never purposely fed/inted, never told anyone they suck at the game, never told anyone to kill themselves, the worst I have ever said is stuff like \"why did you do that\" or \"that was a r%%%%%ed thing to do.\" I know my friend has said a lot worse, and he is honor 5. Someone just please clear this up for me.\n\nThe reason I put this here is because tickets aren't working at all for me.

I wish they would give the full chat log to me, instead of just what I said, it would give a lot more context to what actually happened. Also keep in mind this galio was actually trolling because he didn't get mid.","replies":[{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-11-05T13:43:14.175+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"But you did call someone \"retarded\", and just because they called you that first doesn't mean it's right to say it. You were also talking down on your support from an early point, throughout the game, and later called your jungler \"brainded\". You said you didn't say anyone was terrible at the game, but from your logs, you said \"u cant play anyone but akali\", which contradicts your statement. I personally refuse every surrender vote, and would rather play a 50 minute long losing game than surrender a game at the 15 minute mark. Everyone that I queue with knows this about me, and they know I won't play a followup game with them if they surrendered the previous game. I will however play with them either later in the day, or another day, and I do tell them why I refuse to play with them on the followup game. I've played games where literally everyone else on the team had a heavily negative score, and I ended up being the only positive score, and we ended up winning. Heck, I've even had games where the entire team had a negative score, but a single bad play by the opposing team ended up with us pushing for the win. Unless someone never connected or is constantly intentionally feeding, the game isn't lost by the 15 minute mark. In fact, I've played and won games where one of our teammates never connected for the duration of the game.\n\nFuture tips, if someone isn't performing as well as they could, instead of pointing out what they did wrong and getting mad at them, thank them for what they did right, and point out what would have been better, \"hey ez, thanks for the gank. next time, can you gank them from the river when we're pushed to our turret so we have a better chance to kill them?\". Have a positive future outlook. Swearing isn't completely off limits, just don't direct it at someone, for example, \"damn that was close, we'll get them next time\", rather than blaming your support when the potential kill got away, then directing that anger towards your jungle. Some words and phrases are generally negative and shouldn't be said, and though it seems you know what some of them are, many people would agree that \"retarded\" isn't something you should say to others.\n\nIf you're angry, a mod suggested that it's better to yell at your monitor rather than type it out, as your monitor has no feelings and thus there are no feelings to be hurt. You can also get a pillow and yell into it whenever you're extremely mad.\n{{sticker:sg-shisa}}","replies":[{"poster":"HoboBacon12","date":"2017-11-05T16:57:57.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I understand this, but Galio was trolling really bad, he inted a couple of kills, and just went in, told me to follow, and flashed out at full hp when I went in. And the jg Ezreal was a lot more toxic to me then I was to him, and he ganked like that on purpose to annoy me. Like I said, I wish it gave me chat logs, I was a lot less toxic to them than they were to me. They actually were telling me I sucked and should not play and things like that. And when I said he can't play anyone but akali, galio himself basically said that in champ select. For the thing about swearing, I don't really have anything against swearing that much, I just don't personally do it. Whenever I said something about another person on my team, I was responding to them cussing me out or telling me I sucked at the game. It's confusing to me that I get punished and they don't when they were way more toxic, I would be more okay with it if they were also punished, but because they were all best friends or something and group reported me, I get chat restricted, and they get to go on and do the same thing every game with no punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-06T03:19:44.462+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So basically, this happened due to the chat restriction. While it's understandable that you might have only been lashing back out at someone who started it, fighting fire with fire doesn't make anyone safer and two wrongs don't make a right. While you may not have gotten suspended or banned for this (which in some cases 'retarded' is zero tolerance) this still held enough weight to warrant some type of punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"HoboBacon12","date":"2017-11-06T22:18:05.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, thanks for responding. I guess this doesn't affect me at all, but was I the only one punished because more people reported me than reported others, or because I used the word 'retarded' and they didn't. I'm okay with my chat restriction, annoyed that my honor progress is gone, but that doesn't really matter to me anyway, don't even know what I get for high honor. One last question, will this take away rewards for getting silver + at the end of the season, like the border or something else.\n\nEDIT: also, I won't use 'retarded' anymore, but I'm wondering if words such as lame are not allowed either, I guess it could be offensive to people, but not sure if I'm allowed to say \"that's lame,\" or if that isn't allowed either. Got no problem if it is not allowed, just wanna make sure.\n\nAnother Edit: I am sorry for wasting your time with all of these discussions I have been doing lately, I actually kind of feel bad for making you respond to so many of them. Thank you for taking time to answer these questions and dealing with me.

Saying or calling people that in general public would get a pretty big reaction. That word is widely known for being hateful and very offensive to a majority of players which is why it was actioned on. There just simply aren't many ways the word can be used in good context without being offensive. \n\nOn the other hand, lame really doesn't carry any connotation at all. I can't think of anyway using 'lame' would get you punished off the top of my head, but I definitely wouldn't push it either =P. It's not the best way to go about this trying to think of what words you can and can't say. Rather than fine comb your messages for offensive words, try to just be more lighthearted and accepting of people. If you're being toxic, that's going to be apparent regardless of specific words, it's all in the attitude for the most part.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Imortal Dragon","date":"2017-11-06T03:24:47.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"so i just got here on this discussion. n id say IF the WHOLE team was being equally toxic than is it safe to assume that based on the logs the WHOLE team also got restricted? i mean if no one plays nice than no one plays. kids get the message real quick hopefully teens/adults do to lol.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
