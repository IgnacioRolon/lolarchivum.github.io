I got the games over with, and I saw Broporo's discussion on it. It says that if my chat restriction is still going on then I won't receive ranked rewards. Am I okay now that I already finished those 10 games, or do I still have to do something to be able to get the ranked rewards. If that is so, I will do anything to get them, but I worked hard to get my rank this  season, even though it is only Silver, I would hate for all the work and 106 ranked games I did to go to waste because of one game I screwed up on. Thanks for any help you guys give.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-07T05:49:19.523+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just pulled up your account to check what it looks like right now.\n\nAs of posting this, you should still be eligible for rewards as far as I can tell ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"HoboBacon12","date":"2017-11-07T06:39:33.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much!
