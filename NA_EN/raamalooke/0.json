Unfortunately, if I include a message in the text box and hit &quot;Gift RP&quot;, nothing happens. If I clear the text box and click on &quot;Gift RP&quot;, the window pops up with all the amounts of RP you can buy.\r\n\r\nFor a bit of clarity, the process usually goes like this:\r\n1. Click on the &quot;Click to browse the store&quot; button on the League of Legends client.\r\n2. Once the store is displayed, pick &quot;Gifting Center&quot; along the left hand side.\r\n3. A new window pops up to select the recipient of the gift.\r\n4. The different types of gift will pop up, click on &quot;Purchase RP for a friend&quot; box.\r\n5. Enter message with the present.\r\n6. Click on &quot;Gift RP&quot;. A window pops up with set amounts of RP for you to choose.\r\n7. Proceed with payment options.\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s how it should go from my own experience in the store. However, I can&#039;t get past step 5 if there&#039;s some sort of message in the box. I tried with one or all 140 characters and click on &quot;Gift RP&quot;, but the window doesn&#039;t pop up. If I leave the text box empty, it&#039;s fine and the window pops up.\r\n\r\nIt could be just me that&#039;s facing this problem, so if anyone can try it out as well, it&#039;d be helpful. I understand it&#039;s not a big issue, but it&#039;s nice to add little messages to your friends and special texts to your significant other. \r\n\r\nThanks for reading, have a good one!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-01T22:55:10.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Raamalooke,\n\nThanks for the awesome repro steps for this bug.
