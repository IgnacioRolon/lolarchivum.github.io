When in reality they get caught by 4 members of the enemy team and get pissed because their 250 armor and 4000 health isn't enough to save them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lojician","date":"2015-03-09T16:35:24.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No you didn't.

Currently mages can actually DO SOMETHING (not talking about the BS happening in top lane where certain mages are pushing melees out) mid-late game, whereas back then only the ADCs could even remotely hope to be able to deal with them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2015-03-09T16:40:37.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=lojician,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=9mG3e1VG,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-03-09T16:35:24.117+0000)\n>\n> No you didn't.

Kite comps can be good but unless you have some huge speed boost (like a Sivir ult) then you won't really be securing any objectives or winning many fights without a turret behind you.  A strong frontline will just chase you away while their backline takes the objective, and then they turn around and run once the objective is gone.","replies":[{"poster":"lojician","date":"2015-03-09T16:44:11.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not true.
