I was getting into a ranked game, and we got though champion select and then everyone was at 100% during the loading screen. It was taking a while so I knew something was up. I restarted my computer and I got back into the game but it was already remade. I was in my silver 5 promos and that was my last loss AND I got put into low priority queue...this is ridiculous. I KNOW FOR A FACT that it isn't my computer or my internet. Riot, please try to do something about this. I just want to enjoy League and climb out of bronze but this is making it unfairly hard.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-05T22:12:11.684+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sucks that you had a leave as a result of this, and lost a match for your promos.  :(  I'm not sure what you mean though when you say it's not a connection or computer issue?  I don't have a lot of info to go off of, so I couldn't say for sure.  Did you ever get an error?  Is the issue still happening?  I want to help but I need a better idea of what's going on.  We can't alter stats or your penalty, because the system treats everyone equally, but I'd like to help figure the issue out.  Let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Pashedd motatoes","date":"2017-04-05T22:58:39.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! thanks for replying! okay so basically I have seen this happen to other people as well. It goes like this: You get into champ select, and everyone locks in right? that is all good and lovely. But as soon as it switches to the loading screen(where everyone connects with the percentage bar) everyone gets to 100%. Everyone was at 100 percent and i was waiting for a few minutes and I thought this was weird so I tried to alt-tab out of the launcher but it wouldn't let me, yet i was able to close out of other apps but not entirely switch over. So i restarted my computer, and I loaded league back up and when I logged in it gave me the leaver buster message telling me I have left too many games....I was the first one to 100% on the loading screen so I did not think or know that it was me until that message showed up....I did not get any error messages, and the reason I say its not my connection or something is because I was listening to Spotify and playing games yesterday with no problem. And my system is clean from viruses(according to my antiviral program). I feel so lost and I am just scared that it might happen again. This has never happened before up until like in the last 2 weeks or so. If you need more info, just ask. Thank you.","replies":[]}]}]}
