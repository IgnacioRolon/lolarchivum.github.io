Most games, at least one afk in game, or more.  Most games, one or more players quit at first blood, or tilt into troll mode.  RIOT you do not have to ban them from play, just ranked play.  Look at your discussion boards, the problem is getting worse, not better.  Please consider ranked bans for extended periods.  Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"LeafieGreens2","date":"2019-03-25T20:49:31.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm stuck in silver 4. Just got out of a game where I was ADC. My support died 2 times in the first 10 minutes and this sent our jungler, a Jax, into a toxic spiral tirade. Then he said \"i'm bored i'm gonna int.\" \n\nThen he proceeded to die to the enemy mid 5 times in a row.

They either gonna troll on normal SR or  other maps or game modes if you ban them from ranked. And as  for afk they get  punisht by a automatic system if they afk to mutch on perpes.","replies":[]}]}
