It can be a champ you love and want to make better, or a champ you hate and want to see burn. It doesn&#039;t really matter if it makes it OP or nerfed to hell as long as it&#039;s just a single change. \r\n\r\nAlso, these aren&#039;t realistic changes that need to be balanced or anything like that. It&#039;s purely for fun. \r\n\r\nI would make Thresh hook pass through any enemies in its path and reel all in until the first target reached Thresh. The total speed of him reeling back would always remain the same and wouldn&#039;t be based on distance.
