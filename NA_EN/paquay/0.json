I&#039;ve gone to the Lolesports website and nothing. Nothing on the Lolesports YouTube channel. I can&#039;t find any vods on twitch. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s almost like Riot doesn&#039;t care about the college championship. Why make it so hard to watch these?","replies":[{"poster":"Tiza","date":"2017-06-01T00:46:06.029+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Paquay!  You can find the vods on the uLoL Youtube channel.  Here's a link directly to the videos section of the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8RToqB1bw_aaon_70bdDqg/videos\n\nThe vods aren't on lolesports.com because it's not part of the normal esports broadcast or run by the esports department - it's part of the collegiate program, which is separate!","replies":[{"poster":"Paquay","date":"2017-06-01T06:17:55.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome!
