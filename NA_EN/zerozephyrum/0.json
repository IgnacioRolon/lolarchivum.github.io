This affects me greatly because when I bought the skin I expect it to have its nice looking effects, not the default effects. It affects my gameplay because I get pissed at the skin not functioning properly, which distracts me.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-31T20:22:08.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey ZeroZephyrum - \n\nThanks for the report!
