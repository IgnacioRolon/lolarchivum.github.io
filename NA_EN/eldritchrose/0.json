Now, after playing a game with her, some how I have returned to 6403 IP, though the shop does recognize that i don't have enough IP to buy anything. After checking, this seems to apply to any purchase, not just champions. logging out fixes the total after a purchase, but once you buy something again your IP total freezes.","replies":[{"poster":"Aviatinq","date":"2016-08-14T23:11:59.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I get that all the time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-08-14T22:31:52.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Broken since the last big update, nothing new.","replies":[]}]}
