My usual ping tends to be at around 230 ms - 280 ms because I play overseas, but for the past few weeks, the ping has increased dramatically, now it's at 290-310 ms\r\n\r\nIt is probably worth noting that, at times, the ping goes to 340 ms at the loading screen only, and drops to 290-310 ms in game; but sometime still spikes to 340 ms. Another thing worth noticing is that, around 3 weeks ago, the ping could reach up to 500 ms, but at certain times, it lowers down to 250 ms. Now it is at a constant 290-310 ms, that occasionally spikes.\r\n\r\nI've done a ping test to a Chicago server that shows my ping should be 280 ms, I have done multiple test to confirm this.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-18T16:07:30.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your usual ping is really high, and I certainly can't imagine it being a good experience to go even higher than that.  If you are physically far from the NA server then you can certainly run into issues like this, because your ISP is trying to find a route to get to us.  You can try out the steps in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help strengthen things up, but keep in mind that there may be limitations.  I hope it helps!","replies":[{"poster":"TakeAGuessNerd","date":"2017-03-18T16:46:23.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've done some of it just recently and now my ping is at 286 ms, thank you very much. Maybe I should note that it still displays 350 ms at loading screen (it does gets lower), 300-310 ms at around 10 seconds after the game starts, at a constant 286 ms after that. This really helps a lot for an overseas player, thank you,","replies":[]}]}]}
