What I am trying to say is that it might just be the launcher/client that is bugged and not my connection to the servers...","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-23T22:02:10.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't heard of any sort of bugs that would cause this behavior. I'd like to take a look at your network routing to ensure there isn't an issue there. I recommend running a traceroute log with [**WinMTR**](http://winmtr.net/) during a time you're experiencing the disconnection symptoms. After loading up the app, plug **31.186.224.42** into the host field and start the trace. After you've let it run for 5 minutes, export the results as text and paste them in a reply.\n\nLet me know if you ran into any issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Tzachos","date":"2017-02-24T10:59:34.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                              10.0.0.138 -    0 |  141 |  141 |    0 |    0 |    4 |    0 |\n|      core-213-57-0-137.PT.hotnet.net.il -    0 |  141 |  141 |   11 |   14 |   51 |   13 |\n|                              100.90.1.2 -    0 |  141 |  141 |   11 |   15 |   55 |   13 |\n|            BB-H1-B1.18-PT.hotnet.net.il -   69 |   38 |   12 |    0 |   14 |   19 |   13 |\n|                   ffm-b4-link.telia.net -    0 |  141 |  141 |   76 |   79 |  115 |   77 |\n|                  ffm-bb4-link.telia.net -    0 |  141 |  141 |   75 |   78 |  115 |   76 |\n|                   ffm-b1-link.telia.net -    0 |  141 |  141 |   76 |   80 |  117 |   85 |\n|  internap-ic-305857-ffm-b11.c.telia.net -    0 |  141 |  141 |   68 |   70 |  108 |   68 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   28 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   28 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   28 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   28 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   28 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   28 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   28 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   28 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   28 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   28 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   28 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   28 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   28 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   28 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   28 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   28 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   28 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   28 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   28 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   28 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   28 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   28 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting & Cloud Provider\\\n\nThats after around 3-5 minutes and one error message.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-26T21:24:18.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"According to this traceroute, your connection is unable to reach our test servers after dropping off at the following node:\n\n> **internap-ic-305857-ffm-b11.c.telia.net**\n\nI strongly recommend reaching out to your ISP's tier 2 support team and provide them this entire traceroute so they can figure out what's going wrong after that telia node.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Tzachos","date":"2017-03-01T04:27:35.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your estimate is probably correct.
