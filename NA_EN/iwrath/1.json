Make sure you've got a solid connection when patching, ethernet would be a good choice. If you ever suspect your files might be damaged, try running a quick repair before doing a repatch.","replies":[{"poster":"IWrath","date":"2017-10-25T22:22:25.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It patched just as it has every other time, there was no connection drop, league has had firewall permissions for ages, and the only League file I touch is the button pinned on my taskbar... \n\nNo reason for me to suspect oh hey, I should do a repair because patching completed at 100% then let me log in.\n\nI mean isn't the sort of stuff that should be stopped right there? If your files aren't in order or whatever the problem the client doesn't launch? Why do it at pregame when there's no chance if it happens to get back into a game.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-25T22:38:09.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That might be possible if the game was constantly scanning its files for issues, but that would eat up processing power and stall your pc. Most likely, this only happened because when the game was loading it pulled on a certain missing or damaged file and then crashed because of it.","replies":[{"poster":"IWrath","date":"2017-10-26T02:10:10.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Still brings back the same issue in the title. Why am I losing LP for something I have no control over.\n\nI opened my client.\nIt updated.\nI logged in and jumped in a game under the impression everything was A okay. There were no errors and so on.\nI lose a game because I have absolutely no power to do anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-26T02:18:13.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Essentially, leaving the game for an extended amount of time marks you as AFK, regardless of what caused you to leave. We don't have big brother watching you as you play so we can't ever know the cause, hence AFK/Leaver punishments. If you're having so many problems getting your client to work properly, at this point I'd suggest doing a complete reinstall and clean uninstall using the [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool). \n\nMake sure you are using an ethernet connection as well as running the tool as admin or you risk having this issue happen again from improperly downloaded files due to a faulty connection. If it still refuses to work correctly, the main problem is likely something deeper in your pc. In that event, reach out to our tech team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so that they can help you figure out what's messing up on your end.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
