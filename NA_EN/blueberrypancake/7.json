(And Yasuo as well despite the fact that it was a complete bomb in game,)\n\nI should probably have been more specific, he generally does not stray from meta picks often, Ahri and Cass are both considered to be safe Midlane choices, though Cass isn't played quite as much as Ahri.\n\nThis isn't me trying to necessarily call out Bjerg and I apologize if it comes off this way, I find pretty much every team and their midlaner to be boring, Hai included, most midlaners won't try to play new picks that are outside comfort zones, understandably so, since midlane is arguably the most important position.\n\n If you pick a weird champion and it doesn't work, your team is pretty much boned. Bjergson is probably the most valuable mid laner to his team, which doesn't give him much leeway with experimentation.\n\nUoL and Gravity (Specifically Keane) are my favorite teams to watch personally for good reasons, they actually try to use new ideas constantly. \n\nA better way to say this would be that out of any midlaner, I consider Bjergson to be the one to be the least innovative midlaner, Hai a close second. But that's not necessarily his fault, the amount of pressure on him every game is insane. \n\nHe's going to stick with safe picks no matter what. I could see any other midlaner maybe considering doing some off picks. But Bjergson though, I just can't picture him doing that. \n\nThere are very few meta picks that I genuinely enjoy watching players use, one funny enough being DoubleLift's Jinx, don't know why, but I love watching him play her.\n\nHell I actually miss the days of the Yasuo compositions, those matches are incredibly fun to watch as they try to set up their Yasuo to decimate the other team, it would be pretty cool to see that come back, but he's such a balance nightmare ATM. \n\nIt was pretty funny watching a team first pick the Yasuo and just seeing the reaction from the other team as they knew what was coming.\n\nPiglet played Vayne in his last match, it was pretty fun to watch, I used to love watching Uzi from Starhorn playing that champion, hopefully with this meta shift, we might see more Vayne coming out.
