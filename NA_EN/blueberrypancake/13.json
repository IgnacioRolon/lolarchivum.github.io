Zekes and MC are great against thornmail and the cc of tanks respectively.  The only reason I see for zeke's low purchase rate is how cost prohibitive it is on support wellfare, otherwise you'd see a bit more purchases, still that it is very situational.  The low purchase rate of MS and QSS actually really surprised me, they're incredible items if used correctly, and that +80 AD can make a huge difference late game, allowing you to blow up the enemy mid laner or adc.\n\nStill though they are situational.

It offers a buff to the whole team on shield or heal, but it's just attack speed. Maybe if it were something like, heals and shields also grant the ally an additional shield equal to some small amount, it would be more popular on, like,  Sona or Janna.\n\nZeke's is weird. It should be changed to give allies Armor Penetration instead of Life Steal. That'll make it more attractive for all AD teams. Maybe have it build from Brutalizer and Kindlegem, gives 20% CDR and grants allies Armor Pen and AD? Alternatively, it can have no AD aura and reduce enemy armor in an aura, similar to Abyssal.","replies":[{"poster":"LittleBlast","date":"2015-04-19T20:45:55.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:238}}","replies":[{"poster":"Variks the Loyal","date":"2015-04-20T01:08:52.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The CDR actually won't be as good on Zed because his CDs are gated by Energy costs.

It gives a bit of AP and CDR, decent mana regen, a nice movement speed boost, and of course, gives extra utility to your heals and shields. I enjoy building Censer with Lux to really give the ADC an extra boost, for example. And Alistar? Talk about lane pushing power. The +25% attack speed doesn't seem like a whole lot until you've got it applied to several units at once.\n\nI'll sometimes do Zeke's Herald on certain supports, but yeah, it's pretty weak right now so it's usually one of the last things I consider buying, if at all.\n\nI was worried when it was rumored that they were going to remove Guinsoo's Rageblade a while back. Yeah, it's a pretty niche item, and Jax and Kayle probably get the most mileage out of it, but it's still a fun item with its extra mechanics. Poppy makes good use of Guinsoo's because it synergizes with her passive (as does Maw of Malmortius), and it's not a complete waste since AP actually helps some of her abilities as well. I find the Rageblade also fits Gnar, both mechanically and thematically. The bonus damage from hitting an enemy 3 times can become a good damage output with not only added AP but also attack speed. Gnar gets hyper as he attacks, attacking faster and faster, but then gets enraged when low on health. It's like the item fits _both_ of his personalities.\n\nAnyway, I'm not at all against the buffing of items I already like, but I guess I'm just paranoid that the worst will come from bringing attention to them. Any time I see a favorite champ listed in patch notes, I immediately assume the worse in the \"League of Nerfs.\" And what with Riot's history of removing things from the game outright, I expect them to nix an \"underused\" item completely sooner than take the time to give it the care it deserves.","replies":[]},{"poster":"qetzel","date":"2015-04-18T22:25:01.974+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The trouble with buffing some of those items is that they can easily become too powerful.

There are champions who work extremely with items the majority of the other champs cannot make use of and if you buff these items said champs will become really strong.\n{{item:3091}}  Wits End for example is not purchased very often but its an excellent item for Warwick (must buy on him), it used to be core on Irelia too and you can still build it on her over Bork in certain matchups.\n\n{{item:3504}} Ardent Censer is a very cost efficient item (even without the passive) and gives very useful stats to supports like Sona and Nami who really need mana regen and cooldown reduction, the movement speed is also great on them. I consider it a good buy on Janna or Karma support too since they can give the attack speed buff to all 4 teammates which is especially good if you run a double AD comp.\n\nThere are lots of other examples, taking away those items would really hurt some champions' builds and hence their strength, while buffing them might put those champ over the top.
