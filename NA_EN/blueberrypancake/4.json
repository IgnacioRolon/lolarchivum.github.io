We will always have Zeds and Adcs shredding through tanks. I understand that Rito wants more action, but having good composition variety is healthy. So I have an idea for anti-penetration items.\n\nImpenetrable Armor (pretty simple)\nChain Vest {{item:1031}} + Glacial Shroud {{item:3024}} + Giant's Belt {{item:1011}} + 750 gold (3250 Total Gold)\n\n450 Health\n60 Armor\n250 Mana\nUNIQUE Active: Your champion is immune armor and magic penetration for 2-3 seconds (cooldown 120 seconds)\n\nYou get the basic idea. Have a tank be hard to kill late game. I understand that this is op and lacks counterplay but tanks don't have many options against LW.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-01-25T03:36:22.935+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly? This would be a horrible idea. It's a good concept when you think about it, making tanks actually able to take the brunt of a blow, but now you have to think from a damage dealer's perspective. Almost all mids are purely burst. Pressing this item when they go to burst you would pretty much make you immune to their damage, functioning like a Zhonya's for tanks, but you're still able to move around. Mids already have issues with tanks since most are burst, not DPS, so a tank that can absorb their burst would essentially make them useless. \n\nThen against an ADC... This would force the already horrible META to be all about escapes. It's bad enough that MF, Kog, Varus, Sivir, and Twitch are in a horrible place because they lack escapes. To then make their huuuuuuuge burst that they're known for nulled as well? Where does that leave them? It would make them completely useless until the enemy has used their item to negate the mid if they even have to. \n\nThere's also now the extra sticky tanks using this to dive in the middle of the team. A good form of peel is to burst the tank who just jumped in the middle of your team. Pretty good idea to do that so they can't destroy your carry. These champions are typically junglers though, but some have been known to go top, namely J4, Xin, and Mao. These three have the damage of the gods and the tankiness to match it. If they could now press a button and take a lot less damage? Well, instead of 3 or 4 tank items, they'd only need 3 to negate your team. Randuin's, Banshee's, and your new item. With that, they can get their last two items as their own big damage items to accentuate their already huge damage kits. Imagine a J4 with a Hydra and Scimitar diving into the middle of your team and locking your carry down, murdering it and it can't do ANYTHING because your team can't CC him because of the Scimitar, they can't kill him because of your item while he sustains off his Hydra, and they can't knock him away since he has two gap closers and a slow. \n\nDon't even get me started on what that item can do with Cleanse. Scary stuff right there. \n\nAlso, I should likely mention the biggest thing. The only counterplay to tanks is Void Staff and Last Whisper. To counter an item that's a counter would be the same as making an item for Malzahar that counters QSS. It's just silly.","replies":[{"poster":"blueberrypancake","date":"2015-01-25T04:19:00.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was just pitching out an idea, thanks for the feedback :) I recognize that there is no counterplay to my idea and is gamebreaking it was just something to start a conversation. Tell me what would you like as an anti-penetration or anti assassin tank item. Also I'd like to mention champions that have direct armor and mr reduction such as Kayle's passive still apply the reduction (it doesn't count as penetration).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Syn Zykan","date":"2015-01-25T03:10:42.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"armor pen is countered by health, the problem is hp is so cost inefficient compared to damage it doesn't do its job","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-01-25T06:15:21.280+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll admit that the nerfs to health items is kinda sad. So much so that Sunfire almost isn't worth buying since a Randuin's is just so much shinier and a Warmogs can scale a bit more than it. And of course the two MR items only have 400 and 450 health. Health has become very scarce, so much so that the only tank shredding ADC that's popular is Vayne. I'm sure if they upgraded Banshee's or Visage or Sunfire to compete with Randuin's or even simply just added a new good health item to sit next to Warmogs, maybe a 500 health with 25-30 MR and Armor would be a good addition to the tanks without breaking them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Beerstein","date":"2015-01-25T07:02:13.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Inb4 anti anti-penetration item x.x","replies":[]},{"poster":"LongFur Fox","date":"2015-01-25T06:59:34.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main problem for tanks is not surviving a long time.
