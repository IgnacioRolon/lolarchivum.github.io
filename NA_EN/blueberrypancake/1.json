They know what to expect from their opponent, while noone can realisticly know what to expect from them. A lot of people just look at their picks and think they play yolo style, but in fact they play exactly what is good against what their opponent are playing. This next level of though in their draft phase is what make them so successful.","replies":[{"poster":"blueberrypancake","date":"2015-04-19T17:07:41.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just wish Frozen Heart Varus top was a counter to the meta","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PoisonedTea","date":"2015-04-19T15:53:29.034+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Varus mids incoming solo queue.","replies":[{"poster":"blueberrypancake","date":"2015-04-19T17:06:32.039+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reggie my body is ready","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Synx7","date":"2015-04-19T19:14:45.117+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":7,"body":"Good. i was about to buy my favorite skin, Arctic ops varus.
