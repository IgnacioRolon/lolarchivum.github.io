I am genuinely upset that I cannot get into a game; and I want this to be fixed. \r\n\r\nWith that being said, I launch a game, and all I get is a black screen. Then it tells me my network has a problem, which it doesn't. I try to launch again and again and it won't let me into the game. This has happened 4 times already. If I actually am able to get in to a game, a few seconds in I get bugsplatted. If this happens, it tells me my password and username is incorrect, which is false; I can prove this by logging into the boards to post this.\r\n\r\nPlease don't tell me to launch a repair for the client, because I already have several times. This seriously needs to be fixed. I had no issues prior to the patch. Whatever has happened has caused me to be a leaver for about 4 matches, without me even being able to step foot into the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-19T22:13:21.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The black screen that appears is usually caused by a connection problem failing to download assets, which seems to be the case if you're failing to properly reach the authentication servers.  To help rule out some possibilities, go over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot.  A repair might not really do anything as that fixes game files, not connection.

I have been able to get into a few games, but half of them it won't even launch the game itself.\n\nEdit: In other words, I have actually been able to play maybe 4/10 or so games I have qued for. It's basically just a gamble whether or not I can play.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-19T23:07:00.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem probably isn't your internet, but your own network might be unstable enough to make your connection to the game server unstable.  That kind of uncertainty is pretty frustration, and it's definitely in your best interest to go over those steps and tune things up.  Good luck!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
