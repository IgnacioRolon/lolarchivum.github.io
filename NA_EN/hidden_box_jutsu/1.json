Go ahead and hit up our account agents in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), as it does look like a password change was submitted recently.","replies":[{"poster":"Hidden Box Jutsu","date":"2017-10-10T01:02:25.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't changed my password, nor have I been notified that my password was changed via email. I also just attempted to change my password and it is telling me \"incorrect password\".\n\nEdit: Okay after digging through my emails I actually did find an email saying that someone requested a password change on the 4th of October. This wasn't me, and in the email it states that if I didn't request a password change to leave the email alone. That being said, obviously my password was changed, so might I ask why I didn't receive a follow-up email regarding the change?\n\nEdit 2: So I decided to do a password recovery, which sent instructions to my email and I successfully changed my password. That being said, I received no follow up email stating my password has been changed. Don't you guys think you should probably email people when their passwords have been changed? That seems to be important information that a owner of an account should know, right?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PlantingPain","date":"2017-10-09T16:58:30.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i've had this happen on both of my accounts recently, with the same error message. check you're attached emails i had someone change my password on me.
