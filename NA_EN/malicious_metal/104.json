Little had changed with Viktor, but he instantly went from troll-pick to game-breaking OP.  I went from getting flamed by my team in pre-game to getting flamed by the enemy in post-game.  \n\nThen the nerfs came.  They were maybe slightly justifiied, but rather than getting a small nerf to damage/ratios, the Hex Core passive was hit hard, and far more than it deserved.  \n\nI think what makes me even more annoyed is that in the same patch that Viktor -a champion that never saw play before this season- got nerfed, Lee Sin -a champion that's been in every LCS since his release- got buffed.

Sorry. But that was, like, three years ago? Keep remembering that, alright, but do not use that to excuse EVERYTHING ELSE.\n\nFacts\n\n* Riot asked Morde players months ago what they would have liked and not liked in a possible rework. They asked few things, among which they noted: No hard CC, Soft cc only if needed and avoided if possible, No dashes or engages, Not too much MS boost for engaging ( W change was really liked since it was really situational), more focus on the warrior/tank aspect, more readability and usability in W, more focus on the mace and less focus on E. This is partly the core characterization of the juggernauts, i' m not sure if Riot had them in mind already but if not they were conceptualized that day too. \n\n* yeah, many mains dislike him. Not everyone: you see in boards only those that actively dislike him, while others like it, or simply have opinions in-between are quieter; because that is usually what drives a person to post on boards. For example i like the new rework, even tought i dislike some things like few numbers and most of all the W passive. There is people that does not like it, but again there were people who disliked Sion rework because, you know, people have opinions. You can go out and say you don' t like him, alright, but can' t just say \"muh there is people\" pointing fingers at the sky.\n\n* Non-Morde players have the right to call him broken damage wise, actually any player can, but it stops at that. many people call broken Katarina or Master Yi too, and would still call Morde broken even if they gutted the Q damage because such a sudden high number in a telegraphed skill is really hard to counter!\n\n* What makes you think that pros ban based on hate?\n\n* Also Riot listened to people feedback about BPE: Skarner was weak, Darius was alright only after few buffs and said that the heal was shit, Garen got gutted because lacked too much speed and Fiora was too much punishing. Silence radio from Morde for a while, from which later added the possibility to cast W on self.\n\nWhat does it mean? That Riot listens, but they are not slaves. Listening does not mean executing, and there are far far more people out there that have different opinions from what you say or see. Sometimes you might be right, some others wrong, and you will be always wrong if you do it with arrogance.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2015-10-13T13:13:15.933+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:69}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:43}} \n\nOh, yes, they really DO care......................\n\nOh wait.......","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tooterpillar","date":"2015-10-12T22:00:42.594+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got seriously flamed for playing soraka.
