{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2018-02-20T14:59:44.776+0000","title":"Mordekaiser, The Iron Revenant: A character Study","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":74,"down_votes":8,"body":"Some might have shared my disappointment in the recent Champion roadmap, especially the lack of a certain Undead Warlord, even though he has been listed as a tier 1 VGU priority for the past few years.\r\n\r\nBut him not being chosen for a VGU is not surprising since Riot does not operate on a checklist.\r\nThey only rework champions they have a solid direction, a core theme, for that allows them to push it to the limit and truly create something outstanding.\r\n\r\nSo Akali was chosen, since her theme is a simple, yet resonant one.\r\nFair enough, but it made me think...\r\n\r\nWhat **IS** Mordekaiser&#039;s ONE core theme anyways?\r\n______________________\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s take Swain for example.\r\nHe had a LOT of themes and character traits, some of them clashing, some of them not even explored fully.\r\nHe was a Bird mage, a grizzled battle commander, some weird bid guy, a monster, a sorcerer, a guy who doesn&#039;t like showing his face and has a peculiar choice of hairstyle.\r\n\r\nAnd yet instead of trying to keep all of these intact, Riot chose ONE resonant character trait and just built from there.\r\n\r\nThey are very alike, Swain and Mordekaiser, with them having the potential to be awesome characters but having way too many clashing identities that makes it hard for Riot to just pick ONE and base their entire VGU off of that.\r\n\r\nAnd this is what inspired me to conduct a little thought experiment to maybe give Riot some ideas for what Mordekaiser IS, what he SHOULD be and what he COULD be!\r\n\r\nSo, without further ado, this is a Character study of;\r\n#Mordekaiser, The Iron Revenant!\r\n_________________________________\r\n**Indiana Morde and the raiders of the lost Theme**\r\n\r\nMordekaiser is a very old champion with several themes that seem core to him, but in the end make him a blurry mess in terms of actual character cohesion.\r\n\r\nHe is;\r\n-A Necromancer\r\n-Undead\r\n-A Mage\r\n-A Mace wielder\r\n-Somehow controls Metal?\r\n-Is Sauron\r\n-Is an ancient evil entity\r\n-Is an old suit of armor\r\n-Overlord of...something?\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom that alone Mordekaiser seems somewhat of a thematic mess, with the only pointers to what he&#039;s supposed to be being sprinkled in here and there with snippets of new lore;\r\n{{champion:50}} &quot;A King remains in the Isles, and an other marches.&quot;\r\n{{champion:57}} &quot;Just another pile of bones wearing a crown.&quot;\r\n{{champion:83}} &quot;My army will soon storm your gates, Revenant!&quot;\r\n\r\nMordekaiser is painted as the current de facto leader of the Shadow Isles, an ancient evil that reigned over most of old Runeterra, and was only brought down by the combined effort of the human tribes...as well as being backstabbed by his advisor {{champion:7}} \r\n\r\nThis provides a good starting point for Mordekaiser&#039;s ONE core theme.\r\nHe **dominates**, he **enslaves**, he wants to once again **reign** over the known world\r\nHe is **CONQUEST**\r\n\r\nWe have the grand visionary dictator with Swain, but Mordekaiser is an entirely different Monster.\r\nMordekaiser is, what I could best describe, an **OVERLORD** character.\r\n\r\nTyrant {{champion:50}} &quot;Men are too weak to rule, but I am no man!&quot;\r\n\r\nMordekaiser is no longer human, he has lost his humanity to endless reincarnations, he is solely one Will, an entity anchored in this realm because of simply the desire to Conquer.\r\nHe is prideful, he sees everyone else as lesser beings, he is a force of nature.\r\n\r\nAnd with that in mind I tried bringing forth this beast through Riot&#039;s preferred way of storytelling;\r\nVisual language!\r\n_________________________________________________\r\n\r\nReimagining Mordekaiser&#039;s overall appearance was harder than I initially thought because a lot of people think he does look pretty cool in theory.\r\nBut I have to disagree to notions of simply copy pasting the idea unto a new rig since while Galio, Swain and co. had a distinct appearance, they did not speak of their place in the world as well as their new look.\r\n\r\nEnter new Mordekaiser!\r\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/411203032358060032/411204046477852673/image-4.jpg\r\n\r\nThe first thing someone might notice is the lack of spikes, which was a deliberate move.\r\nSpikes are a cheap way of making something appear evil or wicked, and I tried straying away from it due to its implications.\r\nInstead I tried focusing more on the **Overlord** angle by making Mordekaiser appear eerie and commanding, making him look more like an ancient conqueror King and less like some cheesy WoW character.\r\n\r\nThe main thing I focused on in his visual design was to settle on ONE silhouette that would make him instantly recognizable in game.\r\nMorsekaiser was always a &quot;big&quot; champion, he had to be like that to seem imposing and tough, yet unlike things like Sion the thing that made hims appear so large wasn&#039;t bulk.\r\nIt was his especially broad shoulders and his mantle!\r\nHis Pizza feet are a meme and do add to his mass, but in the end I settled on this aesthetic of Neck-&gt;Shoulder-&gt;Cloak, a Bust so to speak, as Mordekaiser&#039;s core visual cue.\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________\r\n\r\nFinding a suiting color was a tricky thing.\r\nA lot of people, myself included always liked the red and metallic hues of his but in the long run I think they do need to go for one main reason:\r\nUndeath\r\n\r\nYes, while people are attached to Mordekaiser&#039;s metal fantasy, it is just one aspect of many clashing themes that still stand in the way of a unified Character Identity.\r\n\r\nInstead I focused on the cold, haunting hues of undeath, trying to bring forth shapes and colors that speak of &quot;Cruel, Ancient Witchfire&quot; more than just &quot;Look, red eyes, he must be eeeevil!&quot;\r\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/411203032358060032/411203745402191874/colorMK.jpg\r\n\r\nIn the end I think it does make Mordekaiser fit more into the Shadow Isles while still retaining his more &quot;pure&quot; undeath due to the way his color seems stronger and more powerful than the other undead palettes.\r\n\r\n__________________________________\r\n\r\n**Shapes, Poses and PRESENCE!**\r\n\r\nNext up was finding a movement/pose pattern that fit Mordekaiser&#039;s reimagination of this kind of Overlord character.\r\nFor this I looked for inspiration in other, similar characters.\r\nThe most fitting one being Sauron in all his various appearances in movies, games and artwork, as well as his big boss Morgoth.\r\n\r\nI emphasized his shoulder area and him standing tall, looking down on everything around him.\r\nNightfall is still an important aspect of his but instead of carrying it around on his shoulder all the time to show off its weight, I thought making it less clunky of a tool more akin to a scepter would be the right call.\r\n\r\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/411203032358060032/411203171210493972/mkpose1.jpg\r\n\r\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/411203032358060032/411203792198041600/Mordepose2.jpg\r\n\r\nIn the end this would translate very well into practice as it gave Mordekaiser the presence he needed.\r\nIt also made the line between Necromancy/Dark magic and Physical prowess more flexible and flow more naturally since his new shape did invoke feelings of dark power and more sorcerous tones due to the emphasized mantle.\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\n**&quot;Kleider machen Leute!&quot; aka Armour galore!**\r\n\r\nLastly, Skins were also extremely interesting to try reimagining to this change of silhouette and theme!\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst off!\r\n#Infernal Mordekaiser!\r\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/411203032358060032/411203871977766914/infernalMK.jpg\r\n\r\nWith Mordekaiser&#039;s core theme as an Overlord, Infernal instantly clicked.\r\nEnter the King of Hell himself!\r\n\r\nThe emphasis on demonic armour designs and jagged ends made this skin a blast to redesign as I tried bringing the whole &quot;Demon Armour&quot; aesthetic out of it.\r\nThus making hims appear inhuman with a less practical, more mask-like helmet, the &quot;hellish pit&quot; kind of neck guard, as well as the visage on his chest piece!\r\n\r\n__________________________\r\n\r\nA Dragon Master himself!\r\n#Dragon Knight Mordekaiser!\r\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/411203032358060032/411203560487780363/dragonknight.jpg\r\n\r\nthere was a thread a while back where a Rioter asked if people would be alright with DK Morde being more of a &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot; aesthetic but with the reveal of Dragon master swain i though of a better way of including him in this skin canon.\r\n\r\nThis Mordekaiser skin tries being more of a &quot;mediaeval&quot; style and truly bring out the KNIGHT in him.\r\nNot a white knight of course, no.\r\n\r\nA Dragon Knight.\r\nOne that subjugates Dragons instead of slaying them and uses them to wage war, making their power his own!\r\n\r\n___________________________\r\n\r\nJust a Sauron reference!\r\n#Lord Mordekaiser!\r\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/411203032358060032/411203843049783296/lordekaiser.jpg\r\n\r\nI have to admit, it was hard finding ONE good direction to take this skin in but in the end I thought paying homage to this well known overlord was the way to go!\r\nI tried styling the armor similarly to Sauron&#039;s own and made him appear more unquestionably evil and inhuman than the other skins.\r\n\r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\nHe is numero UNO!\r\n#Pentakill Mordekaiser!\r\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/411203032358060032/411203815690207236/PKMordekaiser.jpg\r\n\r\nThis skin was a no-brainer seeing that we already know what it should look like!\r\nI tried pushing this to eleven though by adding a few more Metal references like the hands on his shoulder pads and the black, death metal fingernails!\r\n\r\n_________________________\r\n\r\nBut that&#039;s about it for my little brainstorming session on Mordekaiser and the ONE THEME TO RULE THEM ALL!\r\nEveryone&#039;s entitled to their own opinion and views on the matter but I just wanted to conduct a little experiment to mimic Riot&#039;s own process of refining a champion&#039;s core identity and building a VGU off that!\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\nLet me know what you think about this!","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-02-20T18:59:11.567+0000","up_votes":48,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey up,

Can even throw in well-fleshed out and new champions so it&#x27;s not like you guys are just asking about champs which are up for VGU either.\n\nI get where you're coming from, but I suspect that the current system is driven by the fact that we often have to change our plans.  We might start looking into a champ, spend a few weeks investigating things, and then either decide that the new kit isn't working, or that it needs to go back on the backburner for a while, or there's some new ability tech being worked on that would be PERFECT but it's not ready yet, or another champ jumps up in priority all of a sudden, or the person working on it leaves, or we change the way we do updates, etc.\n\nRiot as a whole is still kinda singed from the past where we'd announce a thing we were doing, and then we didn't do it.  With all the best reasons in the world, players get pissed off - it's understandable.  I wonder if maybe we've swung the pendulum too far in the other direction, but that's probably why champ lists arrive to players as 'late' as they do - we're significantly more confident that we are going to deliver.  (Not guaranteed, but higher confidence).\n\nBut there's the rub.  Having higher confidence usually means that a bunch of the earliest work has already been done and found to have potential.  And I'm pretty sure you guys want in on that earliest phase.  Heck, most Rioters don't get in on that either - there's just too much going on, and in such early, tentative, stages that the attention drain would be real.\n\nHOWEVER that's why I suggest that people get in ahead of any official announcements.

I absolutely agree that the red and spiked should be moved to his Infernal skin (Kind of like how Swain had some of his old themes moved to the new Tyrant).

The other thing is Pentakill and Infernal are awesome to look at, but I feel you didnt include King of Clubs for a reason, its already supposed to be the medieval esque skin, I think there needs to be a specified purposeful distinction between it and the new suggestion for Dragon Knight.

I'd like to start off by stating that I am absolutely in love with the redesign concept. So much so that this will be the first post I've ever made on these forums. This being said, I have some issues with the proportions you decided to go with. \n\nLet me start by explaining why I care about this. \n\nI mained Morde since S2, when I found League. He was the second champ I ever bought, and I ended up getting really, really into his lore (in fact I'm still sore about the retcon because I felt that they demolished his character. The mystery surrounding our Lord Famine/Pestilence was intriguing and I enjoyed guessing his motivations for joining the Institute). However, I have never been good at this game. Silver for life. Morde's character and lore are the only reasons I've kept with the game. \n\nThis having been said, The new lore seems to indicate that the nation of Noxus Is founded on the principle of Morde (I am aware that he came before Noxus). In Noxus, They pay homage to everything the Metal Master was about (in the new lore) while he was alive. Strength, Cunning, Mercilessness, Power. In fact, it seems that he IS the Archetype for Noxus.\n\nWhich is why I take some issue with the proportions you gave him.\n\nIn order to be archetypal, someone needs to represent everything in that archetype. Strong people are massive. Cunning people are reserved. Merciless people are Bad. Powerful people have no fear. Morde should represent all of these in the most archetypal sense possible, since he is basically the culmination of everything that Noxus represents.\n\nHe should LOOK massive, He should SHOW cunning, he should EXEMPLIFY power. \n\nAnd of course, he should BE a very, very bad dude.\n\nIn my opinion, you got 3 outta 4 perfect, and if I interpreted you right, you tried to go a different route with, but keep the fourth. I just don't know if it worked.\n\nBut that's just my two cents. Maybe I misinterpreted, maybe I'm wrong. Regardless, that's just how I see it.
