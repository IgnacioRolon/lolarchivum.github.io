I like Varus for being the flawed and tragic human he was.  A man that chose duty over family and regretted it so much that it broke him.  A man that sold his soul for revenge, having nothing else to live for.  A man that is racing the clock to try and get as much revenge as he can before he is snuffed out.  A man that misses his family above all else.  \n\nBut we don't have that.  He doesn't even have his name anymore.  You literally took his name and gave it away.  I don't care about Varus the Darkin, he sounds no different from Rhaast and Aatrox.  The humans he's made of are literally a footnote, they don't matter.  \n\nEven in the most drastic of redesigns/updates/lore rewrites, the champion has always kept some spirit of who they were or at least their name.  He was a grieving parent (something that is rare in League).  But from this there is not a single trace of original Varus left.  And I don't really see how any add on's to this version of him will improve what is being written over.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2017-11-22T22:38:49.708+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I think that making the Bow an actual Darkin but making Varus expend his life energyu in order to consume the Darkin and use its power would have been a genius move because it kept the integrity of his character and it linked with the new Darkin lore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beyond Legends","date":"2017-11-22T22:25:12.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends what they do with the ionian hunter really.

Totally get how jarring this is, and I promise there&#x27;s major context coming. - as in, significantly more than just this bio.\n> \n> We don&#x27;t want to rush the actual release (our plan was to put the whole narrative out on 11/30, and the final preparations for that are happening now), so if it&#x27;s cool with all of you I&#x27;d rather field some questions here that I can answer now, and you can get the full story for Varus when it launches.\n\nMy biggest concern is how this snippet makes Varus sound largely removed from who he once was. I expect some changes, but this sounds like such a change up that it's hard for a lot of us to relate such a popular and well known champion to something that seems so vastly different that it's downright unpleasant sounding.\n\nMy question, I guess, is how intensely different will Varus end up being from who he once was? I don't expect details, but I think it's clear that a lot of us enjoyed the tragic man who lost his family and now seeks vengeance as a result. Thus far, he doesn't sound like such a person.","replies":[{"poster":"DyQuill","date":"2017-11-23T04:31:56.702+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Twisted Gay,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=1fBLUb9W,comment-id=00180001,timestamp=2017-11-23T04:23:05.588+0000)\n>\n> My biggest concern is how this snippet makes Varus sound largely removed from who he once was.
