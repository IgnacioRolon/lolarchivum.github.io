Mordekaiser counters pretty much all assassins in the game, especially those who need to get into melee range, like Talon and Akali. Since these assassins are going to become very popular picks in the near future, it likely means that he'll become THE anti-assassin champion. What do you think about this? Do you agree or disagree?","replies":[{"poster":"KoKoboto","date":"2016-11-01T23:11:56.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mordekaiser is strong against Assassin's if he is able to get his damage off but he isn't a counter just because he's on your team, the assassin can aim for other priority targets, while using their mobility to avoid Mordekaiser. You could pick Mordekaiser against an Assasin and shut em down but the gameplay there is pretty much the same as any Assassin that is in a losing lane.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2016-11-01T19:25:44.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Troy242621,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6dYz89Uj,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2016-11-01T18:13:44.100+0000)\n>\n> In your suggestion, Malicious, can we keep E&#x27;s shield the way it is on live VS monsters?
