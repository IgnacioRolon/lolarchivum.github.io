I always preferred playing bulky champions, be it Tanks, Juggernauts or Battle Mages.\r\nAssassins, ADC&#039;s and generally high damage, low durability characters were never my cup of tea but I&#039;d be lying if I said the Talon rework wasn&#039;t so much fun to play!\r\n\r\nSo take this with a grain of salt as it&#039;s coming from someone who outright detests playing Squishy, high mobility champions, but moving on.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Passive**\r\nBegone useless 10% damage increase on CC&#039; targets, enter Blade&#039;s end!\r\n\r\nBlade&#039;s end is a lethal DoT Bleed that triggers after applying three stacks with your damaging abilities and then triggering the mark with an AA\r\nIt&#039;s very thematic and adds strong burst to Talon&#039;s kit by giving him ways to combo people with \r\nW-&gt;W2-&gt;Q-&gt;AA\r\n\r\nIt adds a nice little window to trade with enemies or just outright murder them, it&#039;s a great way to make his laning a lot more interactive while not really hitting his Burst\r\n\r\n**Q: Noxian Diplomacy**\r\nThe bleed was moved to his passive and his Q became a short ranged leap or Melee range guaranteed crit.\r\nIt gives Talon some nice mobility now that his E&#039;s blink is gone and even gives him a form of sustain by last hitting creeps with it.\r\nIt made his laning a lot stronger and feels really good to use, seeing that the dash&#039;s quick and smooth with a decent level of decision making\r\n\r\n**W: Rake**\r\nSame as before BUUUT it applies TWO stacks of your passive and the blades take longer to return than before.\r\nIt allows your enemies to either Juke or you to position yourself so that they get hit.\r\nThe animation&#039;s very cool as well, especially on Dragonblade Talon\r\n\r\n**R: Shadow Assault**\r\nSame as before but you&#039;re undetectable\r\n\r\nAnd of course the best part:\r\n\r\n**E: ASSASSIN&#039;S PATH**\r\nThis is by far the coolest part of this rework.\r\nIt allows Talon not only to be THE roaming assassin but gives a lot of ways for Talon to approach his enemies and get into advantageous flanking positions, making him a monster at chasing kills, ambushing unsuspecting enemies or simply escaping through the jungle.\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdict:\r\nTalon&#039;s rework gave him the niche of THE Roaming/Ambus Assassin, amping up the thematic value of his Passive and E whole providing a lot more ways to outplay and counterplay, making his assassination pattern slower rather than just R-&gt;R-&gt;W-&gt;Q POP!\r\nIt made him more interactive while also giving him a strategic niche other than just being picked whenever he&#039;s stronger than Zed.\r\n\r\nDefinitely one of the best Class updates so far.\r\n\r\nThematic Appeal: S+\r\nCounterplay Added: A+\r\nCoolness factor: S\r\nLongsword references: B-\r\n\r\nhttp://65.media.tumblr.com/1d19f6b6a335a07cc5fbbabde34365e6/tumblr_inline_n18ep9QVOQ1qe4wxi.jpg\r\n\r\nNow excuse me while I get a headstart on the PBE for when I inevitable get to play him on the live servers","replies":[{"poster":"Primaquarius","date":"2016-10-19T21:24:03.613+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"#Parkour","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2016-10-19T21:24:37.260+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"#PARKOUR","replies":[{"poster":"Otter Fire","date":"2016-10-19T22:07:25.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**JUMPING**","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-10-19T22:10:23.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PBE access?!\n\nhttps://media.giphy.com/media/kTEQPS7Mj0Kys/giphy.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"Very Hard Engage","date":"2016-10-19T21:42:04.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the rework seems cool overall.\n\nbut i do have some complaints. vault is on a too short of a cooldown, its basically a free flash out of danger if hes ever in the jungle.... and boy let me tell you, this seems to make jungle talon a thing....\n\nand his passive seems too easy to proc when he does commit to a fight.","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2016-10-19T21:48:53.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, he won't be using those walls for 2 and a half minute after escaping once.\nNidalee does basically the same thing but I know it'll be a fool's errand to chase him through the Jungle","replies":[{"poster":"Very Hard Engage","date":"2016-10-19T21:57:26.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or or or... hear me out on this one....\n\nhe also has flash. its going to be the new fizz 2.0","replies":[{"poster":"LoLKiru","date":"2016-10-19T22:07:56.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CrestKnight,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EE1FZAEZ,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2016-10-19T21:57:26.361+0000)\n>\n> or or or... hear me out on this one....\n> \n> he also has flash. its going to be the new fizz 2.0\n\nYou'll probably never be able to catch him if he runs into the jungle; pretty simple otherwise.
