AD is far more reliable damage, and it can be used to take all objectives much faster, even with the recent buff to AP-scaling damage to towers.  \n\nYes,  some AP-based abilities have higher scalings than their AD-based counterparts, they also tend to have longer cooldowns, higher mana costs, and are typically less reliable.  \n\nAdditionally, if you spell-shield/counter/dodge a mage's abilities, you're typically safe.  If you shield an AD-user's abilities, you still need to watch out for their (comparatively) strong auto-attacks.  \n\nThere are some outliers to what I've said, for example Lee Sin's high scalings, Ekko's high auto-attacks, and Orianna's low cooldowns, but overall the generalizations are accurate.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LadyRenly","date":"2015-12-17T22:13:30.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Scramrail,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6n3vvBwA,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-12-17T14:14:15.623+0000)\n>\n> It feels like, for whatever reason, Riot is trying to force things down the games throat as hard as possible.

Without W and the R passive, Tahm has decent mobility on his ultimate, but he's otherwise a weaker Taric.  He has ranged hard CC (similar to Taric's stun) and he's really tanky with E.

From having skills that did this and you have to adapt and learn to play the character. Move \"situational\" bandaids was made. Alot of skills are completly situational now, and not a pure mechanic.\n\nMy favorite champ, Teemo is a bright example for me on this point. He has a pretty pure set of skills. A Q with blind and quiet a powerful %AP. A W with passive and active speed-boost. An E with a well put poison addon that makes playing different weapons an option. This is solid, and also very versatile. And then his shrooms, that make him tactically superior if you take the time to learn them.\n\nAll in all, so many champs are a clusterfuck, not relating to the character they are.
