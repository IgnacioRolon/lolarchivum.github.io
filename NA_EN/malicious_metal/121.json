Right now, honor system is a bit hidden. \n\nAt least in the legacy client, you have to actually *look* for the buttons and you don't get a notification that you've been honor'd until you leave the post-game stats screen. In Overwatch, you get clicks that build anticipation every time you get a stack of commend. Then some nice cheery effects and a voice line from your character at some number of stacks. And it feels pretty damn good.\n\nI think just a little cosmetic touch up that gives instant gratification would help a lot.","replies":[{"poster":"Weasel Kensei","date":"2016-12-17T06:11:52.137+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whats more is they GIVE something.

RP? Not even a lot, just maybe 10 RP for X number of honor votes, say every 50? Also let people know what the votes are worth. People who honer everyone should see the honer they can give out diminish to nothing so they stop doing it.

Currently you have to click on a tiny button if you wish to honor a player. Add in no real benefit in doing this and you have no reason to do it. Or perhaps making players have a popup screen once they return to the lobby asking to select a player to receive honor. \n\nIf they were to have a end of season reward for being in the top 25% of players with honor rating (honor rating is not based on how many honor you but the % of the time you get honored and have a set minimum of total to get a ribbon) that might also be of use. Say there was a skin offered at the end of the season for most honorable players like there is a victorious skin for all gold and higher players that might promote better behavior.\n\nThe real challenge however is making players remember to give honor and making group farming of honor minimally impactful or completely ineffective.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2016-12-16T23:31:58.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My fix is to give 1RP for every badge you get per game (capped at 5).
