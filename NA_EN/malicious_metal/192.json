{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2018-01-29T01:07:23.141+0000","title":"Why I am quitting Mordekaiser","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":215,"down_votes":21,"body":"[](https://orig00.deviantart.net/8502/f/2014/015/0/a/mordekaiser_is_no_longer__1_by_eltonel-d729tog.jpg)\r\n\r\nI know this might be a shocker to some people but I finally decided to stop maining Mordekaiser for good.\r\nIt's not a decision that came out of the blue but it's rather the combined effect of a lot of aspects that have become more prevalent throughout the years.\r\n\r\nAnd it really hurts for me to actually try going through with this but I can no longer say that I am happy with Mordekaiser as a champion.\r\n\r\nHe's accompanied me from ever since I started playing League of Legends in early 2013.\r\nHe was the first champion I ever played and the first one I actually bought a skin for.\r\nHe has been my Main champion for the past four seasons and I've been through a lot with him.\r\n\r\nI was a mid lane Morde main when Spirit of the Spectral Wraith was a thing.\r\n\r\nI was a top lane Morde player when I started picking up tanks, so I always had a strong pick to go up against the likes of Riven\r\n\r\nI went through the mess that was patch 5.16 Mordekaiser and I gave it my all trying to get him into a better spot, advocating several changes that would finally be realized in patch 6.1, returning Mordekaiser back to his mains who loved him as a solo laner.\r\n\r\nBut it's been almost three years since Mordekaiser's rework and I can no longer bear playing him.\r\n\r\nIt is not because he's a bad champion, hell I still maintain a 60% Win rate with him in ranked.\r\n\r\n__________________\r\n\r\nIt is just one major thing that always bothered me but now finally made me decide to stop bothering with this champion.\r\n\r\nIt's Neglection.\r\n\r\nMordekaiser as a champion has been forgotten, left in the dust, to rust away in oblivion.\r\n\r\nHe is not getting any balance changes to make him less of a feast or famine champion\r\n\r\nHe's not getting any tweaks to make him more enjoyable for his mains\r\n\r\nHe is neither getting involved in larger-scale lore events, nor is he getting any Skins\r\n\r\nHe needed a VGU for a while now, but got shafted in the Juggernaut Update.\r\n\r\nAnd it hurts to admit but maining Mordekaiser is **very** unfulfilling.\r\n\r\nMordekaiser as a champion relies heavily on his team, more so than other champion.\r\nMostly because he has **NO AGENCY** over his own success.\r\n\r\nOther champions can do things on their own, set up fights in their favor, combo their spells differently to outwit their opponents, outplay enemies and overall just be **PROACTIVE**\r\n\r\nMordekaiser can't do any of that.\r\nHe relies heavily on the enemy being stupid enough to fight him on his own terms and utterly fails once people know how to play against him.\r\n\r\nHe offers little in terms of outplay potential and even less in terms of COUNTERPLAY, making Mordekaiser extremely unfunny to actually fight and while I do so very much enjoy Riven main's tears, it has come to the point where I simply can't enjoy Mordekaiser anymore since I can't ignore his sad state and affect on the game's health.\r\n\r\nHe has the **Potential** to be one of the coolest champions.\r\nA champion that provides both parties with ways to feel accomplished when playing around his kit\r\nA champion that goes beyond simple meme status\r\nA champion whose spells are satisfying and promote skillful expression rather than brainless button mashing\r\nA champion that can be regarded as a healthy addition to the game\r\n\r\nA champion that fits into current League and one I could be proud to call my main.\r\n\r\n_______________________\r\n\r\n\r\nBut he isn't that champion.\r\nI have been infatuated by the \"Idea\" of Mordekaiser, trying to tell myself he's actually the champion I thought he was.\r\nBut he isn't.\r\nRiot has yet to address his issues and bring him up to date and I have grown weary of waiting for the day that happens.\r\n\r\nSo here I am, writing this as I've gone three entire days not playing Mordekaiser.\r\nHe will always have a special place in my hueart but I can no longer find enjoyment and pride in playing him.\r\n\r\nUntil he gets the VGU he deserves I will be forced to play other champions that deliver on their fantasies way more than my old friend does.\r\nBecause one way of trying to show Riot that there is a problem is by telling hard truths.\r\nAnd acting on them.","replies":[{"poster":"Over

You've always been at the forefront of all things Mordekaiser on these Boards since his juggernaut rework, and have been, in ironic contrast to your favorite character, a voice for hope and constructive exchange. The community has you to thank for for getting Riot to change his title, for pushing towards improvements to his solo laning, and for collating and posting his exhaustive list of over a hundred different bugs, among many other achievements. You have consistently shown optimism and patience where many tenacious players had given up; that this optimism ends today should send a clear message on how the Mordekaiser main community feels about their champion, and the way he has been treated.\n\nFrom the looks of it, you are not alone on this in expressing your disappointment with Morde, and this I think could still be used for good: when the Rengar main community had their own champion affected then ignored for a long time, they banded together and pushed for a megathread. Fast-forward a few months, and now Riot is finally giving Rengar the lavish attention his community wanted, reverting his Q (an idea Riot initially considered a \"nice meme\" a little under a year ago) and even accommodating an alternative AP Rengar build. By unifying and pushing towards the same joint effort, Mordekaiser's mains could also have that same power to reach out and make themselves heard. Even if Riot chooses to defer changes until his VGU, at least it would help inform the direction of his overhaul, and I am sure that many members of the community also have solid notions of smaller-scale changes that could make a world of difference in the meantime.

As Malicious said Mord feels unrewarding to play and i being a player who busts out Mord on occasion stand to agree. He is prob the slowest champion in the game, has horrible base stats, is useless if he falls behind, has no utility, is bugged to shit, has an awful model, awkward build paths, disjointed kit that doesnt work with itself, has been neglected by Riot due to his unpopularity/broken code/unhealthy gameplay, all of his skins are either remodels or recolors and have no SFX or VFX, do need to go on?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ratpie","date":"2018-01-29T01:43:25.382+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have tried playing him in every lane, and I agree, he has no place in this game at this point.  He use to have so much potential.  His best games are often mediocre compared to any other champ.  His ult is his only truly unique skill at this point, but it is so limited.  I do not blame you for dropping him at all. RIP","replies":[]}]}
