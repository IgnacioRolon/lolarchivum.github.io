Being the geek that I am I&#039;ve come to write a lot of stories, having written two short fantasy stories as my High school graduation paper, having even scored the highest of my entire class (Hooray for being Numero UNO)\r\n\r\nSo, beyond that, what&#039;s there to know?\r\n\r\n\r\n**I&#039;m half Swiss, half Italian**\r\nhttp://www2.pic-upload.de/img/31007814/MM6.jpg\r\nMy Mother&#039;s parents did immigrate from Italy in search for work and thanks to them my mother met my Father who was one of the best (if not the only) IT specialist in town.\r\nFast forward six years and I&#039;m born.\r\nOn the eighth of may 1996, having just reached my twenty first year on this planet (Damn I feel old TwT)\r\n\r\nHaving grown up in a multilingual household made me quite the prodigy when it came to learning new languages that&#039;s why I&#039;m currently fluent in English, German, Italian while also being decent at French and having some basic knowledge of Spanish\r\n\r\n**I love animals**\r\nhttp://www2.pic-upload.de/img/31007800/MM2.jpg\r\nI&#039;ve always liked animals, having grown up knowing nothing else.\r\nWe&#039;ve had almost a hundred different cats, always multiplying and kittens popping up like mushrooms.\r\nBut cats aren&#039;t the only pets I have, having had a few parrots, fish and a Gecko, the latter having outlived them all!\r\nAnd it doesn&#039;t end there, I actually frequently take my friend&#039;s two german shepherds for walks and play fetch with &#039;em.\r\n\r\n**I&#039;m kinda creative(?)**\r\nhttp://orig11.deviantart.net/2b7f/f/2015/297/0/2/who_s_the_true_master_of_evil__by_nimrohd-d9e6u1v.jpg\r\nBesides loving to write my own stories and such I&#039;m actually rather decent with the pencil, loving to sketch and draw, sometimes even coloring the sketches with Photoshop.\r\nI didn&#039;t get an electronic device until I was about eleven so I had plenty of time to kill, drawing always having been one of my favorite activities alongside fishing and playing the guitar.\r\n\r\n**I&#039;m somewhat of a Game-nerd**\r\nhttp://www2.pic-upload.de/img/31007805/MM3.jpg\r\nWischer, Dragon Age, League of Legends, you name it, I&#039;m really into games, and not only the gaming aspect of it.\r\nI like drawing fan art, to discuss these games with friends, sometimes write reviews and such and even Cosplay!\r\n\r\n**Bonus Image of Both Morrigan and Hawke**\r\nhttp://www2.pic-upload.de/img/31007810/MM4.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, having taken the first step I challenge YOU to share some of your SCANDALOUS secrets with us so that we can get to know the people behind the usernames and MEMES.\r\n\r\nMalicious Metal, Out!\r\n(And feel free to AMA)","replies":[{"poster":"Jet Sett","date":"2016-06-21T22:29:07.419+0000","up_votes":134,"down_votes":2,"body":"https://memecrunch.com/meme/1NP21/oh-no-he-s-hot/image.png?w=400&c=1","replies":[{"poster":"Virgin Ray","date":"2016-06-21T23:17:56.906+0000","up_votes":58,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean metal gets really hot when exposed to the sun.","replies":[{"poster":"Jet Sett","date":"2016-06-21T23:21:38.787+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, ok.\n\nhttps://31.media.tumblr.com/b2616789a0bd80bb1dd03ea1955eb126/tumblr_inline_mlyuatgWv21qz4rgp.gif","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2016-06-22T07:10:41.873+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"Please, there's plenty of me to go around","replies":[{"poster":"Odyssey85","date":"2016-06-22T11:35:29.387+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope I'm not the only person who read that in Zac's voice","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MavenSong","date":"2016-06-21T21:36:54.964+0000","up_votes":53,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont really have any secrets other than im just a guy who sits at this desk all day with little to no social activity outside of work....\n\nI'm kinda pathetic XD\n\nhttps://openclipart.org/image/2400px/svg_to_png/222252/feels.png\n\nstill cool to see some interesting personalities on the boards, you go man.","replies":[{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2016-06-21T22:31:42.568+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't be so hard on yourself, I'm going to college to become a video game designer and that's about all I'm doing with my life right now (living off of financial aid from college XP). \nIt's not about the now, it's about what you are working towards.

This was a huge pve guild back than on the server Alleria. I was mostly a pvp player but i was good at pve as well. Any ways when i did my test run with them i passed every test with flying colors all for one person. It was one of the higher officers in the guild and she said she didn't like my cocky attitude. To be fair i did have a a bit of an ego than. \n\nAny ways fast Forward a few months and things are great get along with everyone but said one person she would always try and nit-pick everything i do no matter what. I didn't really mind in fact i just turned it around on her and started calling her my wife. You know since shes always on my case and all. \n\nToward the end of TBC we started getting along better thought she would still get all pissy when i called her my honey bunny.  ^_^\n\nIn the start of WotLK i went from being a hunter main to a Death Knight main and every raid night i would tease her and get her all worked up to the point where she would stop talking till i called her honey and she would just blow up every time lol. It was always in good fun and she knew it.\n\nFast forward about 5 more months i go to fill my truck up at a gas station near my home town and this girl said she liked my Death Knight shirt. So we started talking and nerding out about WoW and what not. She asks what server i played on i told her and than shes like \"oh wow i play on the same one!\" I said no way what class? She like Druid! (Now at this point in the back of my mind i was thinking holy shit its her! ITS HER ITS FUCKING HER!!!!!) and so i ask for her in game name she said Healicious and i busted out laughing. \n\nShe asked me what was so funny and so i told her what guild i was in and she started turning red. So i said my hunters name and she just lost it. It was the cutest freak out i have ever seen. After i got her to relax a bit i ask her why she hated me so much. She said she didn't and than kind of mumbled something.\nI asked if she would like to go out and eat and she said yes. Needless to say the next day in guild chat was epic. :))\n\n\n\n\n\nNot my best pic but i just got off work and yes that is indeed a Pentakill shirt :D\nhttp://imgur.com/RS6p1On?noredirect\n","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2016-06-22T07:08:42.012+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had to punch a wall to feel manly again after reading that story.\nMight have contracted a severe case of diabetes though due to how sweet it is.","replies":[{"poster":"Wukong X Ahri","date":"2016-06-22T10:08:53.343+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Poor wall it has no chance\n\nhttp://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/14/144096/3859563-5761069912-38371.gif","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2016-06-22T07:19:51.171+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am now convinced all Mordekaiser mains on this planet have neckbeards.\nThis world just became a better place to live.","replies":[{"poster":"Wukong X Ahri","date":"2016-06-22T10:01:47.688+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CWx7i_gW4AAJYKw.jpg","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2016-06-21T22:37:58.772+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":0,"body":"A great post.

NOT THAT I WANT THEM TO OR ANYTHING!\n\nBut, I'll just tell you a little about myself, since I really like your \"face\" being one of the main ones on the boards and just making the league community a better one\n\nI'm currently a University student in Wisconsin, and after next semester I'll be considered a third year student by credits. I'm currently a professional writing and publishing major, which basically means that I'll be able to write...all formal-like. It's not really what I want to do with my life, not really sure, but I wouldn't have been able to convince my parents to let me be a Creative Writing major. I also think it's just not as secure as a PWaE major. \n\nBut i love English, and my favorite aspect is storytelling. I was a major bookworm when I was a kid, plowing through a stack in a few days, and then my mom, who had dabbled in creative writing, started teaching me as a \"class\" in homeschool. I loved it and it really created this love for writing in me that eventually evolved into a love of storytelling in any medium. I have written countless shorts, nearly a full novel in 7-9th grade and I am working on a different novel now, struggling to re-write it because the plot has changed a bit...Quite a bit\n\nFast forward a few years, I started re-watching a childhood favorite \"Mobile Suit Gundam Wing\" and that was the beginning of the end, my gateway drug into becoming a low key _weeb_. I love anime now. I just love the way it can use music and color and exaggeration in ways that other mediums are unable.\n\nMy childhood was kinda dull because I had no real friends, which is why i relied on books and videogames. I played all pokemon games up until the 3DS because i just didnt want to invest the money anymore, but I have always loved gaming as well.\n\nI have a girl i met in highschool cross-country (i went back for my last two years) and i have been dating her for the past two years +\n\nShe is amazing and while she and I don't share a ton of hobbies, that doesnt matter much to me. Maybe eventually Ill get her to play a game with me, but it doesnt really matter. She is my best friend and as a hopeless romantic, I think love really is enough and it's what you have in common that draws you together and whats different is what keeps you that way. But i think I'll marry her one day, im not ready yet thou\n\nBut this fall I am taking an Media Arts and Games Design course and if i end up liking it, my academic advisor told me she would do an independent study on \"game narrative\" with me.  So hyped that i hope I like it.\n\nHopefully, Ill finish my book one day and be able to write all my other ideas, get rich from it being a best seller, and maybe designing lore and quests for a good mmo one day\n\none day.....\n\nBut yeah thats me, a story about you paid back with one about me !  <3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hello I am Bird","date":"2016-06-21T21:52:19.370+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"You actually look really good.\n\nI don't know what else I expected from Malicious himself, but hey ;)","replies":[]}]}
