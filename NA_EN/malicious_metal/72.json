However, this isnât the best for champs who reapply the slow multiple times like Karthus, Aurelion Sol, and Zyra. Another version could potentially be making rylais an active item where activating the item makes your spells for the next few seconds slow enemies significantly. The slow canât be abused constantly by poke mages in this version (which is one of old rylaisâs original problems) but also sounds like a nightmare to balance. \n\nTLDR; mages donât have a lot of charging items or active items and rylais might be able to fix that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-01-16T04:33:49.163+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think one of the core problems with Rylai's is that it serves two different groups of champions, and so has two different power fantasies: on one hand, it caters to AP fighters who want to close the distance between themselves and their targets, but on the other it also caters to kite mages, who want to create more distance instead. One subset of champions really needs durability to survive, the other isn't trying to get hit in the first place. Because of this, I think the item needs to be split in two, so that both types of AP users here can have an item tailored to them, without having to strike some kind of in-between compromise that harms both. Here are some ideas of what I think could work for either:\n\n---\n\n#AP fighter item:\n\n* Recipe: Amplifying Tome + Giant's Belt + Hextech Revolver + 115g (total of 2600g)\n* Stats: +60 AP, +400 Health (total of +20 Health from components)\n* Active: Target an enemy champion within 700 units, initiating a 1.5-second delay. At the end of the delay, they take 50-125 (+ 20% AP) (+ 5% bonus health) magic damage. If the wielder is melee, the target is also rooted for 1 second. 40-second cooldown, shared with other Hextech items.\n* The main goal of this kind of item is to concentrate Rylai's crowd control into a much shorter, and potentially more impactful moment, so that there is a definite, telegraphed window of time where an AP fighter wants to go in, and have more reliable target access. I figured a Hextech item might be most appropriate, in part because the Revolver effect is good in lane for trading, but also because most Hextech items aren't the best fit for AP champions in general, bar some exceptions. The delay/targeted root is there to offer a different kind of reliability: the active is intended to be effective on back liners, so a typical skillshot wouldn't be appropriate, but the delay instead gives the user's opponent a warning, and time to create some distance, maybe blow a gapcloser, before the root hits.\n* Potential concerns with this item are the root (no item yet has hard CC) and the health scaling on the damage (might be unnecessary for an item focused on crowd control): there is a risk that the above item might be too attractive to tanks, in which case I'd take the health scaling out, and perhaps gate the root duration behind AP in some way as well. Because this is a Hextech item, it might potentially cause conflict with Mordekaiser, who currently frequently builds Gunblade.\n\n---\n\n#Kite mage item:\n\n* Recipe: Aether Wisp + Blasting Wand + Fiendish Codex + 400g (total of 3000g)\n* Stats: +100 AP, +10% CDR, +5% bonus movement speed (no additional stats gained)\n* Unique passive: Upon damaging an enemy champion or large monster with a single-target ability, gain 20% increased movement speed when moving away from them for the next second. Has a 2-second cooldown on activation.\n* The goal of this item, whose stats differ much more heavily from Rylai's, is to give a kiting option for mages that doesn't revolve around crowd control or durability. The main intended beneficiaries of this item are meant to be Ahri, Aurelion Sol, Cassiopeia, Karma, and a few others, and the effect is restricted to single-target spells because kiting champions tend to have more single-target damage compared to most others. Ideally, this should give these champions a strong, damage-heavy kiting option, while also establishing a clearer contrast between success and failure cases: a mage who uses this item successfully should be taking a lot less damage because they'd be able to get out of range of their targets more often, but if they do get caught, they should be easier to kill than if they had taken the current Rylai's.\n* Potential concerns with this item are its stats (100 AP and CDR is a combination only found on Morellonomicon, arguably a fairly overloaded item in its own right) and the uptime on the effect. I'm particularly afraid of how this could get abused by Ryze, who has near-perfect uptime on his single-target spells, and who gets very annoying when he can kite too hard. Additionally, this kind of effect works on LeBlanc, which could push her even further into kite mage territory when that's a direction many of her fans dislike.\n\nA larger concern I have with these suggestions is that they break the Rylai's + Liandry's synergy, which has been a staple on many AP DPS champions for quite some time. At the same time, though, I feel that combo kind of forces one item to be picked alongside the other, and Liandry's in itself is a pretty unsatisfying item that needs a rework, for a whole bunch of reasons (it fits an awkward niche through contradictory stats, serves as a staple on AP DPS when it's meant to be a niche item, and railroads Haunting Guise buyers into an item whose passive they wouldn't normally want). Because of this, it might be better to deliberately end that synergy and flesh out both items individually.

This effect stacks up to 6 times, its speed is tripled for melee champions, and can only be procced once by one spell type every 2 seconds. (Meaning dots and low cooldown spells have an internal cooldown of 2 seconds)\n\nThis should allow champions like vlad and swain to function with the item decently, improve cases such as mordekaiser, and reduce the usefulness of champions who currently keep the item weak like brand and zyra. Cassiopeia also stands to benefit from this, but that should be remedied by the end restriction allowing her only three stacks from her poison, q and e every 2 seconds.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2018-01-15T18:19:09.143+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":6,"body":"What is Rylai's power fantasy - An item that is purely about the passive, an item that keeps champions stuck while you blast them with your rotation.\n\nWho should build Rylais - Any champion that is concerned with crowd control.

Here you go. This is **actual** diversity. You are getting something **different.** You are sacrificing offensive power **completely** to get a different kind of offensive power, one that is pure utility and can really set you up for some devastating plays if you are good. That is what you should be asking for when you talk about item diversity, not just different 100 AP items with slightly different passives and actives.
