That, or make sure they don't play on EVERY cast of that ability. \n\nPersonally, I've found myself rather annoyed by certain voice lines that champions keep spouting, too. The worst offender being Twitch. I -hate- having him in my games. I get it Twitch, you were hiding. I got it the last seven fucking times, too, just fuck off already. Oh noes, something that won't wash off, that'll go well with the fifty other things that didn't wash off either. He's horrible, and I honestly wish there was an option to turn off lines like that, because he repeats them over and over and over, and there's so few lines for each ability that you end up hearing each and every one what feels like hundreds of times just doing laning phase alone. \nJust... make it stop, please. His rework was great, but his voice lines is making me hate him which is a damned shame. :(\n\nAlso, as others have mentioned; Cait's headshot lines. Same problem as with Twitch. I tend to notice it more on her time traveling skin thingy more than the original one. CRANIUM BLAST! BRAIN HOLE!

She would yell while doing Q, say this weird \"hghn\" line whenever she used E, and yell even more while casting R. Except she had a very small set of lines and effects so you heard the same series of battlecries throughout the entire game. I personally _love_ the new militant personality they've injected into Irelia, and think that the rift would feel a lot more alive if characters reacted a bit more dynamically rather than have all their lines only played to the summoner, or during taunts. Imo this new direction is amazing and I hope we reach a level of character interaction close to DOTA 2 eventually.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2018-04-12T16:22:14.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it had started with Azir, actually, where the enemy players basically only hear him yelling \"ONWARD\" and \"TRUST IN ME\" non stop for the entire game.\n\nBut then while that can be annoying, there's also Rakan and Xayah who are on the complete opposite of that spectrum where they chatter way too much across way too many things, and so you just want them to shut up instead.\n\nRiot needs to control the lines available to the opponent so it's not always either complete barebones 2 lines repeated for eternity or its exact opposite.","replies":[]}]}
