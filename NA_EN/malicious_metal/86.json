And it's complete garbage.  Morde felt completely viable in lane pre-rework, **CT** of all people declared his solo laning toxic (he's currently about pre-rework Darius kind of obnoxious if you're in a decent matchup, he was a little better before), and he has more problems than ever.  The cherry on top is his absolutely ludicrous burst, and I feel terrible for any opponents I face who don't know the new Morde well because they keep trying to fight me when my Q is up.  In melee range.  I get kills of those situations on opponents who are full health when I'm at half.\n\nAnd this is about his solo lane, not his bot lane.  His bot lane is starting to appear too strong (probably because of the aforementioned burst for one thing), but his solo lane is considered quite weak.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tyaldan","date":"2015-08-24T16:13:32.828+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"He was very viable before the rework in solo lane. I used to use him top and as a backup mid. He was the epitome of rape minion wave, get slight level advantage, and steamroll the enemy under their turret, then kill them under turret when you get bored. I wouldnt even dream of taking him solo lane right now, and thats sad. They really could buff his w just a bit to allow it solo, maybe make it so it only goes where you cast unless you cast it on another champ, in which case you both get it. That way he can toss it on a minion to gain shield before going in for last hits, or he can toss it on himself and wade in for a bit of heal. It wouldnt be overpowerd and i really agree with everyone that said having it only work with another champ / ghost is extremely toxic to his solo laning. It can be lolsy going \"adc\" and wrecking the other team with the early advantage, but he loses out on seiging power too much to make it worth. His seiges happen every time drags up and that makes it easy to counter him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Scrimshäw","date":"2015-08-24T23:18:51.674+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"solokaiser isn't even a word","replies":[]},{"poster":"CircusT4ffy","date":"2015-08-25T01:43:26.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should make Mordekaiser's W empower a minion that then chases after the enemy laner indefinitely until the duration is up and it dies.","replies":[]}]}
