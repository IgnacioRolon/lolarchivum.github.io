It's a quite a bit different of an experience in higher Elo.\n\nLet me give you some insight here. I've been playing Nasus since s2 as my main, easily over 1000 games on him. This season, on both my accounts between plat 3 to diamond 3 MMR, I have a 43% winrate and 46% winrate on him respectively. But the thing is, I'm not doing poorly on him individually. I have a posititve KD on both accounts and I stay below 4 deaths per game. But it almost always amounts to nothing as I feel almost no significant contribution in any of those games. Compare that to past seasons where I regularly maintained a 60-65% winrate in diamond Elo. \n\nIn short, I can tell you both with experience and numbers that Nasus isn't good right now. He feels like absolute dog shit to play, even when you do well. And I detest the lame ass sirchez afk split push no group style of play and I hope if Nasus turns out to be good with these changes and riot nerfs him, they remove his Qs bonus damage applying to towers and help him in teamfights even more if needed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Great Ozymandius","date":"2016-10-07T18:07:36.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What elo are you at?  \n\nNasus is strong in bronze and silver.
