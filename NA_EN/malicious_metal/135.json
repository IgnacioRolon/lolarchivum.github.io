Because there are so many super mobile champions, you need to be able to lock them in place or burst them down if they are momentarily out of position.

If they gave us tools to do well then ok it would be more forgiving. But when MS, shield generation, range (specifically for Q, as before we could bounce it off a minion wave to hit our opponent), lane pushing power (E got nerfed to shit early game), overall early game got nerfed, it is a bit difficult to come out on top. \n\nThey said that Mord has the defenses to survive down in bot lane. I am assuming they are talking about our shield. You know, the one that within 1-2 AA's is gone, the one that is difficult to get to begin with (minion generation was nerfed and it is difficult to hit enemy champs since we are so outranged). The added defenses we had on W are gone. Yea we can heal with W but, we have to be on top of eachother for it to work making it easier for our enemies to CC both of us (Braum, Nami, Sona).\n\nI also hate that if/when I pick Mord ADC, I kind of force my support into a CC heavy champ. I do not want to force my teammates into picking a champ they are not the best/greatest at. If we want that sustained damage to towers or for teamfights? Mid or top has to grab an ADC to compensate for me picking Mord. I want to play the champs I enjoy, but do not want to dictate the rest of what my team plays (at my low elo people just play what they like, they don't base it around team comps).\n\nThe last, and most important aspect of why Mord players are upset, is that we are now gimped in any other lane. 1/4th of our kit is useless in lane. We have two abilities to trade with pre-6. It is one thing to give incentive for Mord to go duo lane, but another to FORCE him into it. That is whats the most upsetting from what I have seen (as well as personally feel). \n\nFor the record, I HAVE played quite a few games with him on PBE. He can be powerful yes. But if your enemy bot lane is even somewhat competent, you will not be able to get the items you need to make an impact at all. Even if you do well, you still feel like a bit of a burden to your team if you took a \"normal\" ADC instead.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KaisadiIIa","date":"2015-08-12T22:45:37.806+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not about the new Morde being good or bad, is just that they are deleting current Morde to create a new one.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ternt","date":"2015-08-12T13:01:47.559+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"It sucks they gutted a champ, but I seriously hated playing versus Morde in lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Azurasha","date":"2015-08-12T13:05:16.658+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=VakraL,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AwaarZfI,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-08-12T13:01:47.559+0000)\n>\n> It sucks they gutted a champ, but I seriously hated playing versus Morde in lane.\n\nSounds like a bit of personal bias to me.
