I'm prone to bottling up frustration until it all blows up in what I'd say would be a hissy fit of sorts.\n\nBut I'm digressing, this isn't me trying to deal with my issues with my therapist, this is a motherlovin' Mordekaiser thread, goddamnit!\nThe one to rule 'em all.\nConsider this my last stand of sorts, where I recap everything Morde-related and present everything in a neat and organized fashion that Riot might take notice once they get around reworking Mordekaiser in....lemme see Reav3's comment...Sometime in #2019\n\nSo it's Soon(tm).\nBut not soon enough for many of us Mordekaiser mains so I'l creating this thread, hoping it'll at least accelerate a few things, or at least might help Riot see the untapped value of Mordekaiser.\n\nBut without further ado, let us jump in.\n______________________________________\nhttps://img.fireden.net/v/image/1506/44/1506445358198.jpg\n#What is Mordekaiser\n\nOther than an overused Bug meme I mean.\n\nMordekaiser is a **Juggernaut** of the Raidboss subclass.\nHe's a **durable** carry-style champion who thrives when duking it out in the fray, sustaining himself by terrifying in-combat sustain and just wreaking havoc on whoever gets caught in his unholy crusade.\n\nOr at least that is what Mordekaiser's supposed to be.\n\nCurrently Mordekaiser is nothing more than a gimmick, a frankenstein creation of clashing themes, skills and gameplay elements.\nUnlike other Juggernauts, Mordekaiser lacks any incentive to build defensive items, at all, due to him lacking any enabling kit elements like Urgot's **Echoing Flames** or **Noxian Might**.\nCoupled with the functionality of **Iron Man** Mordekaiser HAS to itemize pure, raw Ability power and Magic penetration to even function due to the nature of his kit only lending itself to that; A purely damage oriented champion...\n\nWhich is fine, there are a lot of bruisers whose main contribution to a team is damage, but unlike them, Mordekaiser lacks any **Agency** to actually apply any pressure of his own.\nHe has neither mobility, nor any form of inherent Crowd Control, which puts him in a very weird spot teamcomp wise.\n\nAs a top laner he lacks the sheer Bulk and CC to actually flex as somewhat of a frontliner.\nIn Mid lane he struggles extremely hard against control mages and unlike other mages, he lacks strong RANGED wave clear and CC to be a viable pick \nYou'd think his home would be bot then, given his ADC-levels of **abysmal** Base stats, but even there he gets completely outclassed come 20 minutes due to him lacking range, consistency, sieging and of course, self-reliance.\n\nAll of this points to a fundamental flaw of Mordekaiser's current state; #He has no Place on the current Summoner's Rift.\nMordekaiser lacks a proper position in the ecosystem of League as his kit tries to be a lot of things, but ultimately fails at truly providing what you'd expect from his champion thematic.\n\n____________________________________________\nhttps://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/uJl9cnrEBY2u50LFkV9O-0kXMA0rbICmT0UNvjD8pP0/https/i.pinimg.com/originals/2f/05/85/2f058551892f7f99adea439226a45c4f.jpg\n#What SHOULD Mordekaiser be\n\nAnd yet, despite Morde being such a gimmick of a champion, he attracted a small, but **very** loyal playerbase.\nWe Mordekaiser mains loathe and adore Mordekaiser.\n#I for once hate how much I love Morde.\n\nAnd why is that you may ask?\nIt's not him being flashy.\nOr him being disgustingly Op.\nNor really having any LCS big plays moments.\nHis R34 isn't anything spectacular either.\n\nOh no, we Morde mains love our champion because of the #Idea of Mordekaiser.\nWhere other people see this relic of a champion, a complete dumpsterfire, we see the **Potential** of something greater.\nAnd we're not delusional for doing so.\n\nMordekaiser might be one of the coolest champions, period.\nHis lore, themes and design just scream Badassery.\nHe's a towering Revenant encased in blackened Iron Armour.\nHe's one of the first undead and chose that path so that his conquest may be eternal.\nHe's the Emperor of a long lost empire that once spread across Valoran.\nHe's adept at vile necromancy and still destroys his foes with the crushing blows of his ensorcelled mace.\n\nHe's simply put, #Metal as Fuck\n\nAnd we see that in him. The potential of getting an extremely cool champion whose gameplay and visuals reflect the image that is painted through his place in the Lore and the one we constructed inside our heads.\n\nAs a gameplay fantasy, Mordekaiser encompasses a lot of cool themes as well.\nA reworked Mordekaiser would function similarly to a mix of a Battlemage and Juggernaut.\n\nA durable damage dealer who'll march into battle, knowing that everyone fears his approach.\n\nThink something akin to a {{champion:6}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:266}} \n\nUnlike his AD brethren though, Mordekaiser's Death Knight archetype lends itself very well to the creation of a medium-range based champion.\nOne who despite being immobile as balls, like literally a heavy metal colossus, would be able to contribute to a fight through something a lot more Juggernauts should have; Range.\n\nA primarily spell-slinger type of Juggernaut who'll have the tools to be relevant, to have some agency, without being given extreme mobility.\nhttps://68.media.tumblr.com/ab64a786a978e61e2a5657df0ba15233/tumblr_ou37u66EeL1u1jwg6o6_400.gif\n\nAnd it's a champion fantasy that'd attract a lot more players, it's something extremely cool and satisfying.\nJust imagine playing an 8 foot tall Metal titan who marches into battle, having his every step shake the ground, and every swing just decimate the opposition.\n\nSounds overpowered? Well, this is League of Legends, where basically ANYTHING can be made fair and balanced through inventive design.\nSweet spot hitboxes, delays and other ways of rewarding **BOTH** the Mordekaiser player and the one playing against him are going to make Mordekaiser extremely satisfying to play as a skill ceiling will provide both parties with ways of showing their mastery.\n\n_________________________________________________________\nhttps://us.v-cdn.net/5021068/uploads/attachments/1/8/8/9/2/2/23545.jpg\n#The Technology is here!\nIf there's something that made me optimistic about Mordekaiser's VGU, and frankly, even impatient, is the plethora of new mechanics introduced to league of legends through champion releases or reworks.\nThey all show just in what ways Mordekaiser could be reforged.\n\n**The value of Range on Melee champions and Juggernauts**\nProbably something that makes me really excited for Morde's VGU is how a lot of my favorite champions, despite being Melee, got the tools to contribute to a team.\nThey have abilities that extend their threat range and allow them to have agency of their own, giving them fun ways of being relevant to their team.\n\n{{champion:3}} for example shows exactly how an Ap fighter could function. He's a primarily melee based character but his Q, **Wings of War** really rounds off his kit and delivers on the archetype Morde would be; A Melee Battlemage/Ap Bruiser.\n\n{{champion:6}} Showed that Juggernauts could get away with having range, giving them a threat range of maybe around 400-500ish range and thus allowing them to have the solution to pesky range threats. Without being completely unbearable to play against if you are melee yourself.\nHis passive also introduced a fun scaling to a Juggernaut that keeps his damage relevant throughout the entire game.\n\nBut probably one of the coolest things, and something I would love on Mordekaiser, is {{champion:266}} 's Q cast paradigm.\nSweet spot mechanics would work extremely well on Mordekaiser, or at least on some of his abilities, as it'll allow him to fight Melee and Ranged threats alike and it'd reward skillful uses of such spells. It also allows the enemy to really play around the unique spell AoE and give them ways to fight the champion through well timed dodges.\n\n**What Mordekaiser should get in his VGU**\nThis is an entirely different question though, but for Mordekaiser to truly deliver on his champion fantasy of this lumbering Metal Titan, a Necromantic beacon of destruction on the battlefield, he'll have to follow some design principles below:\n**-Immobility**\nMordekaiser is NOT a champion who'd dash, dodge, jog or otherwise run fast. He's approaching doom, inevitable and something you can see from miles ahead. He would NEVER work well with mobility spells and shall remain this hulking colossus. Not some marathon runner like Garen and Trundle\n\n**-Incentive to build like a Juggernaut**\nThere are a lot of options for an Ap bruiser to itemize, especially a resource-less one like Morde; {{item:3116}} {{item:3165}} {{item:3151}} and they should form the core of a Morde build. But for him to really work like a bruiser, Morde's kit should have inherent features that reward durable builds and help him itemize for the role he's supposed to fill.\n{{item:3053}} {{item:3146}} for example work really well on Morde already, and giving him **Dual scalings** that allow him to scale throughout the game, simply through good base ad and level ups may allow him to build more durable.\nSomething Mordekaiser will definitely need in order to not just be an early to mid game champion is a form of inherent penetration that'll allow him to stay relevant. Ad juggernauts can already itemize Pen through their CORE item {{item:3071}} but Morde would have to opt into a {{item:3135}} \nGiving him something akin to Darius' Apprehend total armour pen might just do the trick.\n\n**-Keep him an actual Carry pick**\nMost of us Morde mains want to play Mordekaiser as a carry, as someone his team can rely on to carry them to victory. Currently it means we're even more limited as his current state doesn't allow for self reliance and actual Juggernaut gameplay. We're overly reliant on our teammates to hold down threats, to tank for us, since our defensive stats are truly laughable, and it kinda hurts to be nothing more than a damage pump.\nSynergy is great, we've seen it in {{champion:50}} , a carry champion who works extremely well in a team-based game, and Mordekaiser could learn a thing or two from the current resident of his old Immortal Bastion.\n\n**-He will need some form of utility**\nI already mentioned Swain, but Mordekaiser will definitely need something that makes him a valuable pick for his team other than just damage.\nCrowd control might work really well with him, seeing that it'd fit his whole \"Slow but Devastating\" approach to things, but there are countless other ways of giving him ways to be of use to his team if he's behind.\nHe'll need a **Fallback Pattern**-\n\n**-The \"Core Identity\" Dilemma**\nMordekaiser currently has TWO things that make him stand out from his peers, and it's what makes him really cool and cherished by us Mordekaiser mains.\nThose two things are him being able to ENSLAVE his fallen foes to do his bidding, and the other is him becoming more durable, the longer he's in combat.\nMordekaiser es numero uno, Always shield, never die, Huehuehuehue was THE meme for a reason.\n\nBut both are problematic, but both SHOULD be preserved.\nBut how?\nWell, that's actually quite simple;\nNo actual mechanics need to be kept as long as the **FEEL** remains.\nTearing out your enemies' souls to fight for you and feeding off the sorrow you sow on the battlefield need not be bound to these archaic, old designs.\nThey can be reinvented, but they NEED to stay in some form.\nIt's simply WHO Mordekaiser is.\n\n___________________________________\nhttp://66.media.tumblr.com/6e4ab0ea710236a75cb9495bf5f57eac/tumblr_o3ofom6BuJ1ucq9cfo1_500.png\n#Conclusion\n\nWell, this is totally going to be my LAST Mordekaiser thread, or at least one on his gameplay and a future VGU.\nI haven't covered his lore and other themes, but aimed to simply put forward everything I deem Important for Mordekaiser's VGU to truly succeed.\nI hope someone at least found it entertaining  or interesting to some degree, but it's just something that needed to be said.\n\nMordekaiser is the sole reason I play League of Legends, and I, and the rest of us Mordekaiser mains, want to finally see our Heavy Metal Overlord be brought up to date with League's current design.\nWe want him to be given his due, to finally be reforged into something we, and the rest of the League community can Love!\n\n#Thanks for reading.\nMalicious Metal out","replies":[{"poster":"Quiet Dude","date":"2018-08-07T17:23:45.801+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":1,"body":"I can't wait for his VGU in Winter of 2020","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2018-08-07T17:24:36.449+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mean 2220.","replies":[{"poster":"Quiet Dude","date":"2018-08-07T17:25:57.595+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Riot Games of Star Fleet acknowledges Mordekaiser is in need of a rework, it would be crazy to think he wont have a VGU in 2221\"","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2018-08-07T17:48:23.261+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Patch 300.298.01, Ryze is now a tank which builds assassin items in order to gain mana, Mordekaiser is listed as the Soon TM VGU but voices run as they are going to shift visual resources into the new MF ultimate skin.\"","replies":[{"poster":"VermillionWolf","date":"2018-08-07T21:00:31.697+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"And the new lux skin*","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nrsh","date":"2018-08-08T10:21:04.541+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Silly you.

But let's not even consider a rework for a second. Let's take Riot's statement about how they're not reworking Mordekaiser. You know what, that's their priority. But why is Mordekaiser not ever allowed to be a strong champion? He hasn't been strong since the juggernaut rework back when he was op in LCS, because of his XP passive and his old synergy with runes. Then pre season hit, all his runes got taken away, and his, \"stat adjustment,\" gave him LESS than old runes gave him, when every single other champion in the game got either the same or even MORE in cases like leona and supports.\n\nHe's okay now. But Fleet is not Mordeakiser playstyle or fantasy. It's a sustain type playstyle with very little damage. And I know technically this means Riot's rune rework was a \"success,\" because Morde has different playstyles. But the reason I take fleet is because he loses every trade top into things like fiora, Jax, Kled, and the most obvious one, Garen (one he used to dumpster. Now he gets dumpstered). They all used to be skill matchups, Now you just get beat, so you either are going to need to gimp yourself with nerfed Aery, or take the sustain route through fleet. \n\nHe needs a base stat adjustment. He has needed one for far too long. He needs 10 more movespeed, more armor, and more scaling HP. His armor and MR are meant to be low. They were never very high. But his Health pool was, and there's no reason for him to be so slow as a melee champion. The reason his move speed is so low is because he was designed to be a bot laner, and with W active, it boost your movespeed way up, so it was Riot's idea to give him meaningful cooldowns and window for power. He is not a bot laner any longer. So he needs movespeed so he can keep up with his opponents.","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2018-08-07T19:51:42.620+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Precisely.\n\nAlso a reason for them neutering his MS was because if them balancing around the {{item:3116}} {{item:3078}} combo, because they deemed it core on release.\n\nWell, Tri force isn't really a staple Morde item anymore and Rylais was severely nerfed, the slow in particular got lowered from 40 to 20%.\nNot to mention the constant nerfs to other toys of his like celerity.\n\n10 MS can't really be too much to ask, especially not since his MS pre rework was a whole 340.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Juggernacht","date":"2018-08-07T19:41:25.541+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Respect for making this post.

When my friend first introduced me to LoL he told me to look at the champions and choose one I like. I browsed through the champions and after a minute or so I saw Mordekaiser. \"This one looks cool\", I said to my friend, he responded by bursting out in laughter \"What's so funny?\", I asked, \"Mordekai, that champion's name is Mordekaiser! You randomly chose a champion with your name!\". At that moment I already knew that I'll devote my time to learning how to play him and he became my unchangeable main. Reading your thread made me go back to that moment, the one that made me play LoL in the first place, and I'd like to thank you for that.\n\nNow, after I'm done being all emotional, I'd like to bring up something that you didn't mention, and to be honest I don't see many people mention, that thing is Nightfall. \n\nMordekaiser is awesome enough as is, but to add on his unending badassery, his mace is named Nightfall. Now, in my eyes that means how special his mace is: it's not just any mace you can buy at your local market! It's his ass kicking spikey partner Nightfall! The fact that his weapon has a name means it has a personality, it can't be replaced, something I don't currently feel while playing him. I see this as a very important thing, and I really think that a lot of thought should be put into making Nightfall feel like a special mace, Mordekaiser's mace.\n\nI really do believe that together, we Mordekaiser mains, can make at least some kind of impact on Riot, and get ourselves a true Iron Ovelord.\n\nMordekai (aka Nrsh), a true Mordekaiser Main.","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2018-08-07T20:06:06.672+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for your kind words, I really appreciate 'em! :)\n\nAnd of course Nightfall's also a metal reference!\nA Blind Guardian one no less, one of my favorite Metal bands.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoyToHOWSV8","replies":[{"poster":"Nrsh","date":"2018-08-07T20:13:13.056+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you already brought it up, my LoL dream for a long time now is marching down mid lane playing the reworked Mordekaiser with this truely amazing song playing in the background!","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2018-08-07T20:17:24.536+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Off topic but you should really listen to the other songs of the album and read the Silmarillion (which is what these songs are based on).","replies":[{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2018-08-07T23:08:08.632+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a dry read but very informative I recommend","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jerry SeinfeId","date":"2018-08-07T19:01:23.488+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the mace with the fire inside and the face like design made me think of something that might be somewhat interesting.

Or would it have to be something like CC resistance? \n\nSecondly, as I feel this needs to be addressed: Adaptive damage on morde. If he has more AD, he deals physical damage, if he has more AP, he deals magical damage. He still can have both AD and AP scalings; would this work out on morde?\n\nAnd third, the sweet spots you mentioned. What if we made it both a sweet and a sour spot, depending on the build? \n\nFor example: we give him a cone attack. If you're close to the target, the cone scales more heavily on AD, less on AP. As you get closer to the outside, it scales more heavily on AP rather than AD. In other words, the build type would determine the threat area of the spell.\n\n~~This kind of thread is going to happen every roadmap, isn't it?~~","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-08-08T08:38:03.308+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a terrific post, one I very much agree with. I completely agree that Mordekaiser as a character should be an epic evil necromantic warlord who radiates heavy metal in theme, and his gameplay should be that of a slow, but terrifyingly powerful hybrid between mid-range battle mage and close-range juggernaut. Mordekaiser is both a necromancer and a warlord, and the solution to his current lack of agency should be by giving him range and exceptional durability, both of which should allow him to march inexorably on a path of destruction. Mordekaiser is perhaps the champion least well-suited towards mobility, and we've seen so few champions with actual immobility that I think if Riot were to give any to Morde, even in the form of a movement speed boost, it would be an implicit admission that movement in League is fundamentally broken.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nrsh","date":"2018-08-07T22:47:15.010+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got a great idea!
