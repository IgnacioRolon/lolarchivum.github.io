In the past we have been pretty slow at delivering these. We have decided to dedicate a large majority of our art resources on Champion Update to VGU's going forward. Any time spent of the smaller VU's would delay are large VGUs. \n\nWe have also decided not to do the medium scope projects like Fiora/Shen in favor of our large VGUs. This is why the roster projects won't have any model changes, since our character art team will primarily be focused on big VGUs. We want to get these big VGU's out at a much quicker pace then in the past.  There are still a lot of champions that don't need big VGU's and those will probably show up in roster projects.\n\nTL;DR: Less VU's and GU's and more VGU's, Small GP updates will be in roster projects","replies":[{"poster":"Baron Von Bangin","date":"2016-02-10T18:11:31.782+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a bad idea.
