He's never been a 'hybrid', almost always been that hulking AP death machine who might have picked up a Gunblade prior to WotA getting CDR... but his remake gave him little incentive to buy anything with AD on it given nothing in his kit uses Lifesteal, it's all magic damage, and he can't crit, so a good chunk of items are near worthless on him given the fact he synergizes with absolutely none of the secondary stats on AD items.

Outside of a Trinity Force, which was more for the Sheen and speed boost than any of the stats, he really doesn't scale with -any- AD items. Pretty much every AD item is a wasted compared to an AP or tanky item since the AP items give damage plus a second effect. I mean, at best MAYBE an Essence Reaver JUST for the 30% CDR for the R and spamming E even harder, but that's still 20% crit that's wasted and the mana proc.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2015-11-14T13:11:37.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SpecterVonBaren,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=sTOIIbJk,comment-id=0002000000000000,timestamp=2015-11-14T02:29:41.656+0000)\n>\n> ?
