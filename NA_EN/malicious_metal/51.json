Given, his other skills do pitiful damage.\r\n-Ap builds aren&#039;t nearly as common as they should be.\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong? Did they mix things up? &#039;Cause I&#039;d rather have a tankier morde with consistent DPS feeding into his shield than what we currently got.\r\nHell. what the hell happened to this statement?

Damage over time turned into the obscene burst of his new Q.  Solo lane Morde was given up on due to \"being too toxic\" and he was instead thrown into bot lane as an \"experiment\" with his new W passive and the dragon ghost.  His durability was nerfed from there to put him more on par with ADCs and to \"compensate\" for his new shield storage element of his passive, his E damage was nerfed so that he wasn't overbearing in the harass war early on, and he was given a form of sustain when with a partner to help him throughout the early levels.  His base stats were nerfed because he was going too fast and being too sticky with Rylai's and Triforce and abusing his Q base damage.\n\nNone of this was really necessary.  Morde is just as toxic in a duo lane as he was in solo, he's generally burstier and more binary than ever before, he was permabanned at World's and still has a high ban rate in ranked, and fits NONE of the vision they had for him.  It's the definition of a failed rework.  And almost every reason it failed can be traced back to the fact that they just kept ADDING to his kit.","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2015-11-05T16:34:41.452+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is spot on. \n\nI would add, though, that if Meddler said that they originally planned to go tanky, they had a build at one point testing that.

If that's what they feel Morde needed, I can understand passing it to CT.\n\nThe \"Iron Revenant\" (I guess I'll refer to his new title...) doesn't sound like a squishy DPS, though, which is what CT did. He should be a Juggernaut. You know, like other Juggernauts he was released with. Having a vision where he replaced the ADC wasn't ever going to deliver on that and be balanced. I'm sorta baffled that they missed that point. It's an important one. \n\nPersonally, I think it's time to revisit him... it's soon, yeah, but oh well! He's broken, and needs a fix!

I fully believe that he can be a viable champion without either of those things.  But when you stick so much of his damage on an ability that takes time to get out, you decrease his overall durability, and you drop his very limited mobility even further with nerfs to his movement speed, you have a very binary champion who relies on a lot of other factors besides \"Get close, hit hard\" (the juggernaut creed) in order to succeed.  \n\n\"Can I complete Rylai's?

He's got some cool stuff, but requires so much to succeed that they couldn't help but make him an overloaded champion.  He's binary, clunky, squishier than ever, very little like his old self, and represents a large scale balance problem.

I have played Morde quite heavily on one of my other accounts and found his e is pointless early unless you are about to abuse your shield for an early engage while coordinating a vamp with your support, making you really hard to kill but at the same time without having any dps of your own.\n\nI think mord should fit more around the revenant and iron themes focusing on tankyness in the undeath, otherwise we keep what we have at the moment and shelve it with a sticker saying \"needs more work\".\n\nTo finish: Mord doesn't need 50 different systems to work with, only a few that complement him.

Yes, even with his new E.  That's why Riot decided after playtesting that sustain would likely be necessary and added it on to his W to allow him to stay in lane with ADCs.  Whether or not this was a good idea at all is up for debate.  You're also bringing up a point that we've continuously raised in regards to this rework, that's it's just too much, which is a classic CT complaint.\n\nYour comparisons to Vi and Vlad are also... baffling, to say the least.  Vlad is a sustain god, one whose fairly low health costs are overwhelmed by healing from his free and spammable Q.  Vlad will almost always make an HP profit with his abilities, something that Morde simply cannot do since the health cost was added to his W.  Vi is a mana based champion and thus should really not be compared to a health-cost based champion, as her shield is essentially just gravy on top of any other sustain she may get and does not need to offset health costs.\n\nAnd as for your suggestion about how he should focus more on tankiness and undeath, how would you like to accomplish that?","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-11-07T03:41:04.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My focus was not on hp cost casting but for overloading the ways in which champions can do something.

It could just be the way I played/built him, so bare with me.\n\nA lot of people are forgetting how STRONG his old Q was. His old Q could potentially take 50% of most squishy champion's hp mid-late game. Combine that with how strong his old E was, you could easily flash Q + E + Ignite to kill people, or even a simple flash + E + R. His old damage was very bursty... his new kit does indeed have burst, but with just one ability, although a VERY strong ability. In order to burst people now, you gotta stack your Q up to the 3rd strike, flash + auto against squishies.\n\nThe problem with his new burst is that it is MUCH more telegraphed than before. Giant Red glowing mace. If you see him with this, you know to back up, or expect a flash + Q to the face. Before the rework, there was no way you could react to his burst. Heck, even in lane, once he got enough items, if you were too close to minions at half health, expect an E + R + Ignite. Lategame, you have to hope Mordekaiser doesn't flash E + R combo you, because there weren't any signs of his burst.\n\nLike I said, I may have built him differently in mid lane.

Old Morde built tons of AP, could burst/delete squishies, get somewhat tanky due to shield, and in the right circumstances could go 1v5. New Mordekaiser does the same exact things, except now he builds AD/Hydrid instead.\n\nIf Riot decides to make Mordekaiser more sustained damage versus burst damage, then they need to throw away his current ultimate. His ultimate makes him want to kill the ult-marked target and if he cannot easily do this (ie sustained damage) then the ultimate needs to go. It sounds like Riot wants to turn him into a teamfight-oriented Tank/Juggernaut. To make this work Riot would also have to buff his shield mechanics, base Health and Armor, and Health and Amor per level. If they want to keep him as a melee Burst Mage, then they need only to tweak his kit abilities.\n\nOld/New Mordekaiser is one of those champions that is a balance nightmare. The slightest buff/nerf to his kit's numbers can make him OP or UP quickly. There does not seem to be any middle ground with his Old/New kit. Riot would have to drastically rework his kit and change his identity if they ever wanted to make his more fair. But trying to make Mordekaiser fair is like trying to make Katarina fair, if Kat can easily get Double, Triple, and Pentakills, she is overbearing and OP, and if she cannot, she is useless and UP. Ultimately for both champions, being able to delete champions is central to their kits because all they offer is damage. Mordekaiser has some more utility because of his ghost, but otherwise, all Mordekaiser has to offer is damage. Because Morde is a MELEE MAGE without any CC, his playstyle becomes binary: either he deals his damage payload and gets the ghost or he fails and becomes useless.\n* For example, if Annie became melee and had to walk into melee range to cast Q, her ability to deal damage would be gimped, so Riot would have to buff her base stats or give her E a shield or something to prevent her from being blown up every time she walked into melee range. Annie would be kited to no end and her kit would become binary like Morde's.\n\nPerhaps Mordekaiser should become a Ranged Mage (close/mid range), making his ability to deal damage more consistent. Of course they would have to rework his numbers, a Ranged Q that dealt 1200+ damage would be ridiculous. (Although Ranged AD Carries begin to deal up to 600-1200+ damage late game, just saying)\n\nOr perhaps Mordekaiser needs more CC or utility to help him or his teammates. Numerous things have been suggested, personally I think he needs a slow on his Ultimate (Like Nasus W: Wither). A really strong slow on his ultimate would force opponents to spend flash or take massive buttloads of damage because Mordekaiser was able to get into melee range and Mace of Spades them across the face. Currently, Mordekaiser has absolutely no CC, so pairing him up in the botlane with a CC-centric champion (Leona) so he can cover the ground (units) to deliver his damage payload.\n\n\"Misery loves company.\" Too true for Mordekaiser Mains,\n-RockJockey","replies":[{"poster":"Baron of Bread","date":"2015-11-05T19:54:05.650+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"One big difference between new Morde and old Mordekaiser is that Mordekaiser didn't have endless frustration for not being able to use one of his abilities and did not rely on his babysitter to do anything.

Sometimes trying to please the mains is not possible while still making an interesting, balanced champ. \n\nSpecifically, referring to WhiskerWow's statement, Morde shouldn't retain his burst, imo. He should be a juggernaut. And keeping that super high damage is what turned him into the current Frakenstein. He's an abomination, because the morde mains were scared to lose their precious burst. Just like Garen and Darius, it's okay for there to be cases where he can do high damage, but it shouldn't be so easily accessible. That's how we got to bot lane Morde, and look how that turned out.

None of that was what I wanted as a Morde main, none of that (IMO) FIT the champion, none of it was necessary.  I didn't want a janky ADC replacement or Dragon ghost for EXACTLY this reason.

Before, you got an MR(Abyssal works well) and Armor(Zhonya's, typically) item and then you built PURE damage so that you can use the shield and a WotA or Gunblade to keep yourself up. With his passive giving him a reason to get health, he can pick up a couple of health items. \n\nBetween the E giving him 15% and his passive letting him have a minimum shielding so it all doesn't decay, the new passive is far superior to the old one. Faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar superior, plus he didn't give up his base value for his shield as you'll see in the numbers provided below.\n\nBefore, it was 90 base plus 30x Morde's level. That's 120 at level 1 and 540 at max level. Now it's 25% of his max health, 1/4th of his health. That means for it to equal 120 at level 1, he'd need 480 health, which he most certainly has with his base being 525. At max level to get 540, he'd need 2160 health and with him being at 1760 at max level, he'd need about 400 health to equal the same, which isn't hard given Rylai's is a good go-to item and this thread is about making him go tankier, so more of a 3kish health Morde with sustained DPS, which is about 750 shielding max.\n\nSo, his update actually increased his shield and increased its scaling while making it to where he needed health late game to keep up properly!

Tanks have strong innate defenses which they build upon with tank items - I can play Ashe and build tank items, but that doesn't make her a tank.\n\n> Between the E giving him 15% and his passive letting him have a minimum shielding so it all doesn't decay, the new passive is far superior to the old one. Faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar superior, plus he didn't give up his base value for his shield as you'll see in the numbers provided below.\n\nHa. Not even remotely close.\n\nFirst, his shield drains at a significantly higher rate than pre rework. Secondly, it benefits from a smaller percentage of damage, before it was 35%, now it's 25%, again strictly worse. Third, he has overall less ranged damage and AOE in his kit - his Q has no AOE, his W is unusable, and his E had it damage dropped heavily. Finally his build path is screwed up because he's forced to build both move speed and health now, meaning he has overall less AP meaning he does less damage and generates less shield.\n\nMordekaiser's shield is drastically weaker than it was pre-rework, and I'm surprised that anyone could possibly think otherwise as one of the goals of the rework was to nerf his shield. Let us not forget what CertainlyT said about him before:\n\n_\"That being said, Morde is not likely to return to the \"immovable object\" capable of permanently keeping a shield large enough to slough off entire trades. To the extent that is what you enjoyed about Morde solo lane, you're out of luck.\"_\n\n> Before, it was 90 base plus 30x Morde's level. That's 120 at level 1 and 540 at max level.

This means he needs 2520 max health at lv 18, or +750ish health.\n\nAlso, the rate of drain has increased: before it was 3% of his maximum shield per second (after being out of combat, mind, so it did not immediately start draining), now it's 1.5% of base health which if we compare it to his shield at 25% base health drains at a rate of 16.67% per second which is insane. In order to equal his old rate of drain at 3% of maximum shield at lv 18 he would need a shield size of 883 or 3532 maximum health which is around the level of a full tank build.\n\nMorde's shield is much smaller, and nigh impossible to maintain.\n\n> So, his update actually increased his shield and increased its scaling while making it to where he needed health late game to keep up properly! Which is perfectly fine with me to be honest, we want a tanky Morde with sustained DPS anyways, not this gigantic bursting destroyer that fills his 700 shield with a single E+3rd Q.\n\nSpeak for yourself. I liked his actual functional shield which served as his primary defense, rather than this supplementary non-shield which is impossible to sustain. Mordekaiser is considerably _less tanky_ now than he was before the rework - even with tank items. Also Mordekaiser as he is, can only function as a gigantic bursting destroyer; for him to be anything else, they would need to give him CC and possibly mobility.\n\nThe only think that changed post rework is that he can no longer destroy by himself, and constantly needs someone around to hold his hand the entire game or he fails.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Shosuko","date":"2015-11-06T00:45:37.081+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Morde is a re-work that needs a re-work badly.\n\nHe didn't gain interesting gameplay options, he got yet another kit where it's all about numbers.\n\nAre you fed?
