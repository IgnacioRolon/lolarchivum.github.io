But you already know that for a fact. I myself are still very,very, very angry at this piece of shit \"Upgrade\" that was forced upon the champion we all used to love.\n\nIt further pisses me off the fact that WE warned of this disaster before it was even live, and still the designer behind it (Not gonna say names to keep it in old rage rather than new rage) ignored us because he fucking knew best. For a fact he knew shit about the design of this champion.\n\nNow, we just get shitty tweaks to his new already awful kit in order to call it a day and avoid heavy back-lashing, at least for a while.\n\nChampions should be balanced around the players who enjoy playing them, not just a single douchebag that thinks he knows best and molded him to his liking.\n\nI'm pissed, really pissed to see this kind of treatment be allowed on the champion that got me into this damn game. And to this day, my only way of showing them how displeased I am with all of this is to refuse to support/play the game at all, until he is either back to functionality, reverted, or properly reworked.\n\nOld Mordekaiser was a true General, a true fucking Behemoth, a true fucking Juggernaut. This piece of shit, however, is just the work taken from somebody's ass.\n\nThey kept fucking up with the designs, changes, tweaks, even when they came with the shitty yet generic \"The Lord of Death\" title to further prove they don't have the sightliest idea of what the fuck they are doing with him anymore. They aren't even trying with him.

I have played Pre-DoomedWork Morde, I was with any other Morde main making his case for them to stop the rework. I've been through it all and let me say this. \n\nThey. Done. Screwed. Up.\n\nThis has to be the saddest moment I have seen for the iron man and before pitchforks arrive, hear me out.\n\n\nMorde was, in my opinion, in a solid spot before this rework ever happened. Everything in his kit  worked gloriously around his passive which is what made me want to play him. This was a champion who's passive, unlike a lot of champions, wasn't a simply buff but a tool. In the hands of a good Morde, you always had some kind of shield, otherwise not so much. That is what so interesting, The range of value you got from him was based on your experience alone. Even if you were in an unfavorable match up, say {{champion:103}}. She has always been annoying for Morde to deal with. Plenty of tools to deal with him. There was still plenty you could do even if you can't harass her. Throw your W around your self when your about to take a ball, Q a minion and get shield from each one it echoed to allowed you to stay in the game instead of being thrown out by all these long range champs.\n\nWell look at him now.\n\nHis passive, what i considered the most influential part of his kit was trashed. His shield gain is pitiful early game compared to what it once was,  a necessary tool that made Morde what he was, and then they stick him bottom lane where your guaranteed a long range opponent that will undoubtedly poke you. I always had doubts with the rework and his current state unfortunately proved them to be correct, he simply doesn't feel fun to play as and hurts me to play as knowing him from pre-rework  and to see how low they have dragged him down. Anytime you time to E the carry you will just get kited down. Their range just is longer than the E ever could be and even if you do hit it, you will either lose the trade due to the health cost or come out barley even. \n\nThe 3x 3x 6x Q now did nothing but hurt Morde. They put a ridiculous amount of Mordes power on the Q during the rework and though they hated the idea of the {{summoner:4}} third Q, but what did they expect us to do? No sane person would willingly let us hit them with the third Q and it was our only true way to output his damage without help. You see, the key to the problem, once again, in my opinion, is the bot lane switch. Its purpose was clear as to make Morde a more team oriented champion and threw this reliance on your support to be able to contribute to the game. The side affect is that you lack significance until such on opportunity a rises. Of course  it wasn't like this before, after the rework he was a god and would roll over any adc but that just showed how bad of a spot adc's were in at the time and how wonky Mordes numbers were. If they actually wanted Morde to be a bot lane menace they would have made his Q like the old one except when it would echo out, it would bounce around like a {{champion:9}}  E and then his E would have another 300 range! Sounds ridiculous right? Well unfortunately these are the sort of things they would have to do to his current catastrophe of a kit to make him an actual bottom laner. Better base stats will help don't get me wrong but its the kit that is the ultimate problem. They tried something for Morde which failed horrendously but still want to make viable solo lane and keep the bot lane idea going for what ever selfish reasons they have. The result is that they don't make a move in either direction, not back to the old Morde or something crazy for bottom lane Morde but eliminating solo lane Mordes viability and so were stuck watching them fiddle around with numbers praying it might work out.\n\nAs a result a feel as though he will be out for the count for a while until Riot makes a bold move on him. With this Shakespearean tragedy I have stopped playing League and have playing some Pikmin 2 again. Ah those good days when the solo player experience actually mattered. Rest assured, I haven't given up. I'm just waiting until the time is right for Morde to rise again.\n\nIn the mean time I look forward to Yooka-Laylee from PlayTonic games,  hope some Banjo- Kazooie fans are still out there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Artificial Human","date":"2015-12-10T18:54:38.385+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Okay, im really curious.

Because of that is why he got butchered and his movement speed crippled. I'm up for changes, the thing is these changes weren't for the better and instead finished ruining the champion. He was given a nuke in exchange of every single tool in order to allow him to apply it himself, therefore, forcing him into a duo lane. Again, I'm up for changes but the thing is when your champion gets totally changed to serve another role outside yours then being up for changes is just irrelevant from that moment on. That is why I'm personally angry at them. For taking the champion from me and serving him to another different playerbase that only use him for the cheap stuff, but now that he's been \"balanced\" and all the artificial advantage shits the designers implemented on him are gone then nobody plays him for real. No mains, no Freelo Express riders alike, no one.\n\nI played mostly main top lane Mordekaiser, and he was pretty damn good up there, granted, in the right hands.\n\nI like Ranged Morde more than this version and if it were for me I would gladly sacrifice his Mace for the identity back.\n\nYou have very valid points, but the very reason we are pissed is because this rework was a total failure and alienated us from the champion we love. So these changes made us angry, and the \"Change\" mentality is irrelevant to us Morde players because these changes just took the champion away from us.","replies":[{"poster":"My Waifu Vanilla","date":"2015-12-11T05:47:05.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember saying the first time he hit pbe for the \"rework\" they should've just went all-in on an AD rework instead of this hybrid shitstorm we got.

And I love last change to Q scaling, maybe it isn't as strong as before, but you can safely max it last, going for really good sustain and ganking power from W and good shield gain from E, while not loosing too much Q damage. Last game I went 12/4/19 and I had a lot of fun. But solo lane? For now, I'm gonna pass on it. Until more changes are made, he won't be that fun on either top or mid lane.","replies":[{"poster":"DrOinkleBerry","date":"2015-12-10T23:58:47.649+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is really great in the jungle for clearing, dueling, and objective control (dat Dragon Ghost).

But that's just me, everybody has their style and that's what makes the world rich so props to you for sticking with your strategy.\n\nThis Morde is easy to shut down by any competent player who also happen to have any knowledge on the champion. Old Morde was amazing at top, even better than mid but new Morde sadly just plain loses to 90% of the matchups up there. I don't see any champion whom might have difficulties at top vs Mordekaiser but that's probably because I mained him and know him from A to Z. Pretty sure I can counter new Mordekaiser with any champion, even with the new Soraka at top (I used to do lots of Top Soraka before her rework. Could first blood Riven players at 3:00 mark, and could shut down Old Mordes pretty hard with her). Although, old Soraka would have been a nightmare for new Morde.\n\nThe issue with this Morde is that every single weakness he had in the pass has been greatly amplified and he is now easier to shut down all game by competent teams.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Khâmul","date":"2015-12-10T23:56:07.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jotunheimr,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uIqeApch,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2015-12-10T23:47:18.720+0000)\n>\n> I can agree with this.\n> \n> Solo Top Mord IS possible in the right hands.\n> \n> In terms of w useage, have you tried using 2 movespeed quints, taking ghost and flash, and getting boots early?\n> \n> Lv. 1 at almost 350 movespeed is a lot better 325.

So my early is reaally weak so i play really safe .\nConcerning the summoners, I play ghost/ignite or flash/ignite (I take the boot with the enchant to reduce the cooldown of these spells). Unfortunately, Mordekaiser needs ignite (especially if you want to get kills in early because his ultimate get countered by a health potion...\ntaking ghost or flash isn't a strategy (because i play normal,my pc is fucked up for ranked XD). but if it was in ranked,it would depend of the enemy composition.","replies":[{"poster":"Vhalthoria","date":"2015-12-11T12:26:30.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Khâmul,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uIqeApch,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2015-12-10T23:56:07.652+0000)\n>\nUnfortunately, Mordekaiser needs ignite (especially if you want to get kills in early because his ultimate get countered by a health potion...\n> taking ghost or flash isn't a strategy (because i play normal,my pc is fucked up for ranked XD). but if it was in ranked,it would depend of the enemy composition.\n\nActually, he doesn't. I mained Top Mordekaiser with mostly Ghost/Teleport and I feel confident in saying you really don't need Ignite. If you are using your Lv1 Ult for the DoT damage then you are using it wrong. At Lv1, it should be used as an Execute, meaning that you really need to make the proper calculations in order to kill with the initial burst or as I call it, \"The Cardiac Arrest inducing spell\", not the DoT.

Still, I adopted an aggressive playstyle where I hardpush. I'm in this case waiting for the jungler, so I pressure the lane opponent to the point where going 1v1=equal death. So when the jungle come,I go back and observe the reaction of both players ,their health.Since I always take potions to be 70%hp or +,I can trade the jungler without using the ultimate and the ignite (if the other player come,he offers me a double kill)\nOfc you can use your teleport to have more presence in the game. But I choose to have more presence in the game by removing the presence of the enemy jungler from the other lanes XD. I think it's just a playstyle that is very tricky (sometimes,it ends as a faillure but it's fun).","replies":[{"poster":"Vhalthoria","date":"2015-12-11T16:38:13.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Khâmul,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uIqeApch,comment-id=00000001000000010000,timestamp=2015-12-11T16:20:11.265+0000)\n>\n> the thing is , when i don't have ignite, i use it as an execute (as you said) or when the enemy doesn't have potions anymore.

I went to base, finished my core items and as soon as I saw the enemy jungler ganking and bot engaging with mid health everyone, I teleported there in the bush, activated ghost, and blew their ADC out of nowhere in a instant, then resumed to wipe the other two while their top never had the chance to follow as he canceled his teleport due to it happening so fast. After that their bot was just completely demoralized lol.\n\nThe Hue Express was my term for teleporting with Ghost/Homeguard and ramming over everything while perma-slowing and burning my targets. Those are the day I miss the most, the days of Old Mordekaiser's badassery.
