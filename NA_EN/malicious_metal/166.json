Sure, every role has brainless point and click champions, but ADC is the definition of point and click. It's the only class that completely relies on point and click for damage. Sure, mages have Annie, but they also have champions like Xerath, Karthus, Vel'koz, in fact, most of the class has dodge-able abilities. Same for Assassins. Sure, Akali is point and click, but Zed needs to land his 3 in 1 skillshot and dodge a shitload of spells in order to land his combo (and is also gated by cooldowns!). What about ADC's? The vast majority of ADC's are just point and click. Sure, we have champions like Ez who's skillshot based or Jhin who has cooldowns on his high damage autos, but the rest of the class is just auto-attack for days. Not saying that ADC doesn't take skill to play, just saying that there isn't much counterplay to the class. I feel like ADC is the class that deserves a massive overhaul the most out of any other class. For several reasons but this is one of them.

There isnt room for anyone to outplay, they just throw everything at you and pray for their numbers to be bigger than yours. \n\nYes but those champions are generally considered outliars in design and balance and are generally considered unhealthy for the game. (and even then, some of the champions that you listed as examples really aren't. K6 is easily dealt with if you group up, especially since he doesn't get his isolation bonus and has no escape if he fails to kill his target. Syndra is never going to kill you by just pressing R. She needs to land at least one of her skillshots before she can instagib you.). The problem with ADC's is that this kind of point and click design isn't antiquated, its the norm. The new champion Xayah kind of proves this to me. Half of her damage comes primarily from auto-attacks and her attack speed steroid. The other half comes from recasting E to get that feather damage, which is incredibly difficult or impossible to dodge. Sure, its a step up from a champion like Twitch or Vayne who are entirely point and click, but Riot has no intentions of solving these problems in design and keep them in the game.\n\n> ADCs arent the exception, its just that they are broken right now. When they are weak they usually get bursted easily or get tanked until way LATER in the game. Not gonna pretend its healthy gameplay or that they have a say on it, but neither have juggernauts when they get kited into oblivion (or alternatively run down entire teams like it happened in s5).\n\nThis is the other problem with the role. But I'm going to have to do a bit of explaining here. ADC is currently very strong right now, but that's fine, because literally every other class in the game does this. Very rarely do we have situations where classes \"coexist.\" Top lane, for example, has always been dived between being a lane for carry picks, and being a lane for tank picks. You never really see the two coexist, although you may see some overlap. ADC, like any other class, cycles between being strong and weak. The problem is, of course, that ADC is the only class in the game that is MANDITORY. That is, that even if ADC class is absolute garbage (think back when ADC in 2k17 was a relevant meme.) They still need to be picked because in pro-play, you need someone who can shred towers at a safe distance. And the meta then trickles down to solo-queue as pros and pro streamers pick these meta champs, and eventually everyone decides to copy the pro's meta because they want the freelo. Sure, maybe playing Darius bot or Yasuo bot is really good, possibly even better than ADC's, but in incredibly high elo, and I'm talking challenger here, its always a better choice to get someone with ranged. Because ADC is the only class in the game that is manditory, it ends up feeling really bad to play when the role sucks, and it feels overwhelming to play against when the role is good. In the case of any other role, this is fine because if the class sucks, you could always just pick a different class to fit that lane. Not with botlane though. They are stuck playing the role of ADC no matter what. This is why the stereotype of ADC mains being whiny babies came up. They are like this because their role genuinely sucks to play when its weak as shit. This is absolutely why moving ADC out of being mandatory botlane, and in turn allowing other roles to go to the duo lane would be better for game health. Making it so that metas could exist without ADC's, but also having metas exist where ADC's outside of the botlane other than those same championsthat everyone brings up. (make it so all ADC's are semi-viable mid for example, in the same way that almost all mages are at least playable as supports.) That way players that are attached to the marksmen playstyle can play their mains in other lanes, where as more variety can start to appear botlane, and so that one player doesn't get stuck having to play the shitty ADC. \n\nBecause of ADC's being required, Riot also needs to buff them up quickly and make them overpowered if they ever become to weak, which is what happened during the pre-season where ADC was considered in its worse state possibly ever. I remember specifically a reddit post where a Rioter talked about this exact thing. I believe it was on a post talking about Yorick but I literally cannot find it right now which is a shame its the post that made me realize what the problem with ADC's really is (well problems but still.)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AwesomeGuyDj","date":"2017-06-30T22:45:40.973+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is why people say smite is a more skillful game.\nLitterally EVERYTHING is a skillshot.
