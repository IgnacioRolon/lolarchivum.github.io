The real value of this skill lies in Warwick&#039;s duelling prowess through the 70% healing this ability gets at rank 5\r\nThe ability to dance around skillshot reliant champions is also invaluable and makes him hard to peel off once in range\r\n\r\nhttps://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zW-Jfb-xEGA/WHXF_LKDGbI/AAAAAAABA-0/gI3UzRbaCtQm3LdUTj55WSHJ6cOhkuxEQCLcB/s1600/WarwickW.png\r\n**Blood Hunt**\r\nOkay, this is probably my favorite aspect of his new kit as it&#039;s not only a passive and thus always active but delivers on his theme as this Chimeric Werewolf out for blood.\r\nIt is THE thematic core of his kit, not only through its awesome SFX&#039;s but also by Warwick going feral and just following the scent of his victim&#039;s blood.\r\nThe movespeed is great, the tracking allows for some rather nice chasing tools and the Attack speed makes him extremely lethal when stalking low HP enemies\r\n\r\nAnd the active, oh boy.\r\nIt&#039;s basically a better thrill of the hunt, driving that spike into Warwick&#039;s spine and going all beastmode on the enemy, it&#039;s definitely where Warwick shines in the mid and late game when he gets going and stalks his prey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://3.bp.blogspot.com/-REa6P2ja08E/WHXF-4fCGlI/AAAAAAABA-s/bhWgHdVunGoMhL1kGlB3cjBBirWC1-bKQCLcB/s1600/WarwickE.png\r\n**Primal Howl**\r\nRemember old Warwick&#039;s ganking?\r\nMe neither...\r\nBut with this new E Warwick actually has a way to reliably gank without him to be six and his ultimate being off cooldown.\r\nPrimal Howl is not only great CC by being an AoE FEAR but also the diving tool he needs to do his job.\r\nNothing beats lunging in with your R only to absorb the blunt force of the enemy&#039;s retaliation with its damage reduction and just fearing all of them once the effect wears off, makes him a force to be reckoned with.\r\n\r\nAlso, protip for early WW ganking.\r\nUse Jaws of the Beast to get behind the enemy and fear them away with primal Howl, makes for a rather fancy early ganking tool.\r\n\r\nhttps://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bxJWe0Kf4xc/WHXF-4OdS3I/AAAAAAABA-w/sww8kSsBeyUj1jUg5Gw9mmOCfeNa8E8RwCLcB/s1600/WarwickR.png\r\nFinally, his ultimate **Infinite Duress**\r\nIt didn&#039;t change all that much besides being a SKILLSHOT, which scales with MOVEMENT SPEED.\r\nI feel like I&#039;m just constantly repeating myself but this just works so well with Warwick&#039;s fantasy.\r\nAmassing a buttton of MS only to lunge straight for the enemy and trying to rip their throat out really fits the Werewolf theme Warwick&#039;s known for.\r\nThe entirety of its damage healing him seems a bit excessive but then again he&#039;ll use it to engage, thus making the heal less of a problem.\r\n\r\nWhat this ult creates is a skill ceiling which promotes one of my favorite things about league STRATEGIC THINKING.\r\nYou&#039;ll have to know how to flank and when to engage to get the best use of Infinite Duress as otherwise you&#039;d just get exploded or just waste it on a frontliner.\r\nIt works well with Blood Hunt to create this hunting Fantasy Warwick achieves even better than current Rengar.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Closing Remarks**\r\nThis Warwick rework is beast, in more ways than one.\r\nNot only did it keep the core of his being intact but IMPROVED it in every way possible, it delivers on his thematic fantasy as well as giving him more depth and agency other than pressing R on an enemy champion.\r\nAll in all I feel this is one of the best VGU&#039;s since Sion&#039;s and I&#039;m definitely going to add Warwick to my Champion pool.\r\n\r\n(Also, Tried playing him top, doesn&#039;t work that well, sorry Tidal)\r\n\r\nAnyways, I&#039;m totally amazed of how Riot managed to capture the essence of Warwick and just put it into a really cool kit, truly delivering on everything one would hope for when picking the Uncaged Wrath of Zaun.\r\n\r\n10/10, would give CertainlyT another chance to rework some ol&#039; champions.\r\n\r\nhttps://4.bp.blogspot.com/-H6Jut4zV1H8/WHXWuM57JHI/AAAAAAABA_8/NSutXRxbz5c2mbHjm_XFW49h8Nv8dalUQCLcB/s1600/Warwick_Splash_0.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Over Innsmouth","date":"2017-01-11T15:14:02.912+0000","up_votes":48,"down_votes":2,"body":"https://img.ifcdn.com/images/a177f20720e7a49c6e86a221830ab45c9b025dee1fddebdf7c12afc8e236e65e_1.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Sraeg2013","date":"2017-01-11T22:49:57.357+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/1e/1e859988f3abb4b93763c98510cbb3b97c525bdbf32f4cdc3981d5170392bf79.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Mistress Madoka","date":"2017-01-12T07:31:34.592+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://cdn.meme.am/cache/instances/folder51/500x/74655051.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Sraeg2013","date":"2017-01-12T14:26:00.331+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://i.imgflip.com/1hiwgx.jpg","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2017-01-12T00:11:04.054+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice breakdown.
