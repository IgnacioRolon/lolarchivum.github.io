On the surface his affliction to Metal seems rather forced and there seems to be no connection between his themes of Pain, Undeath and Metal. But there is one! If you could just open your eyes and try and form your own characters and be creative there&rsquo;s plenty of reasoning to keep Mordekaiser the Master of Metal, even if only at heart.\r\n \r\nMetal is an element, which has various aspects I&rsquo;d like to delve into in order to make Morde&rsquo;s theme more coherent.\r\n \r\nMetal is a great conductor for Heat, electricity and the like&hellip; So what makes Undeath and unholy energy any different than say warmth? They&rsquo;re both types of energy and  thus need some kind of conduit for them to spread quickly.\r\n&gt;Metal could be a conduit for Mordekaiser&rsquo;s undead energy, being the locus of his power, further increasing his tremendous dominion over the very essence of death and serving as his primary element to spread his unholy element&lt;\r\n \r\n \r\nMetal is cold, emotionless, lifeless. It&rsquo;s perfect for a being that exists to only bring suffering upon the living. Metal is a manmade material often associated with destruction and torture (weapons, torture devices) and thus should be attributed to Mordekaiser who seeks to bring the gift of eternal pain upon his enemies.\r\nIt being of no organic/living descent would make it an inhospitable body to posess, resulting in a state of pure agony for any soul, accustomed to a living body, being bound to a shell of metal.\r\n&gt;Metal should serve as Mordekaiser&rsquo;s prison, his very soul being tormented by the cold, grim element as its cold grip on his soul inflicts pain upon his very essence, it should be akin to an Iron Maiden, tearing at him, making him suffer. Yet Mordekaiser&rsquo;s sheer force of will makes him endure and even use the object of his own torment to inflict even greater pain unto his enemies, a cruel irony and a statement to how powerful Mordekaiser&rsquo;s will truly is&lt;\r\n \r\n \r\nMetal as a genre of Music; Metal music is powerful, it&rsquo;s brutal, it&rsquo;s heavy riffs and beat just resonate so well with a heavy metal Juggernaut, a being so powerful it bends life and death to his will and whose pain is only a mild distraction to him.\r\nMorde would make one hell of a mascot for any Metal band, being the epitome of what Metal would be as a person.\r\n \r\n \r\nMetal is what we&rsquo;ve known since his release; Mordekaiser, the Master of Metal is a classic, a meme, he&rsquo;s been in our hearts ever since we first saw him. He&rsquo;s one of league&rsquo;s oldest champions and should be treated with respect.\r\n&gt;Embrace Mordekaiser&rsquo;s Metal theme instead of shunning it. He&rsquo;s due for a Visual update so add back his Metal effects and don&rsquo;t use their absence as a cheap way of justifying the change of title.

I would add that champion titles need not have any relation to their position in society. Even if Mordekaiser winds up being the big hotshot of the Shadow Isles and all that is undeath, he does not necessarily need to have his title changed to reflect it because that is merely his station in life, not the defining aspect of his character and personality. Just as Swain's title reflects his defining personal trait rather than his job, Mordekaiser's should define who he is as a (former) person, not what he does in the world. Master of Metal does a much better job of this than Lord of Death, especially when tied to character history, as you have demonstrated.
