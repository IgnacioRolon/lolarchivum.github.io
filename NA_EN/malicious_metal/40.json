(like how players constantly seek ways to trivialize mana and cd's, and how riot has been lowering mana costs a lot since I started playing)\n\nSo in that respect I feel that's one reason why mage itemization lacks the luster it rightly deserves.","replies":[{"poster":"Not Surrendering","date":"2017-10-03T03:22:47.361+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yes I think so.

Number 1 - the original {{item:3001}} rework involved transforming it into basically an MR Sunfire Cape that reduced the MR of nearby targets with each burst, stacking a few times. So Riot has already tested a potential AP Black Cleaver and found issue with the idea.\n\nTwo - If sustained mages weren't already doing their jobs quite effectively, Riot would never have introduced {{item:3194}} . Tanks have been complaining that MR is too burst-oriented and does not do enough to prevent sustained magic damage for 4 seasons now. Sustained damage mages have enough power in their kits, they don't need a special item.\n\n\"Tank-busting (% bonus pen)\" - Tanks are intended to absorb burst. They are intended to basically swallow a mage's rotation and come out alive. The mage's job is not to kill tanks, it's to kill everyone the tank is body-blocking for. Juggernauts and divers will usually only have one MR item ({{item:3156}} /{{item:3065}} ) and assassins are supposed to kill mages if they manage to close the gap. The mage has to peel for themselves and soften the assassin up at range in order to kill them. \n\n\"More flat pen\" - This would not affect mages nearly as much as it would affect AP assassins. Penetration over ability power favors champions with high base damage and low AP ratios, which are assassins. In particular, in a world where MR pen is powerful early and easy to stack, I foresee the return of assassin Elise. And we have a brand new Evelynn to contend with as well. AP assassins do need their own itemization update (not as much as divers) but let's not pretend that flat penetration is something that would be a 'mage' item. Flat penetration would give up AP. You'd see flat pen items that had 40 or 60 AP (like old Liandry's before Riot just decided to flat buff the item so _someone_ would buy it) and other passives to make up for them, and no mage would touch them because they value their ratios too much. \n\nHigh AP values should not be matched with CDR - They're not. And this is important. Battlemages currently have low AP high sustained damage CDR options in items like {{item:3100}} and{{item:3152}}  but they are **choosing** the higher AP options over those. That's not because the CDR options aren't good. They're amazing. Mages of all stripes just prefer raw damage output.","replies":[]}]}
