{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2017-10-10T10:57:14.717+0000","title":"@CertainlyT, Mordekaiser's Juggernaut Rework in retrospect","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":74,"down_votes":26,"body":"Time flies, doesn&#039;t it.\r\nIt feels like yesterday when Riot announced Mordekaiser&#039;s rework as a part of the infamous &quot;Juggernaut Update&quot; together with Darius, Garen and Skarner.\r\nIt marked the beginning of me flooding the boards with Mordekaiser related topics, urging Riot to return Mordekaiser to a solo lane and going over several thematic and lore-related aspects of Mordekaiser and how they should translate into the game.\r\n\r\nAnd back then I was just some Gold V Mordekaiser fanatic who didn&#039;t really see the grand picture of Mordekaiser&#039;s rework, blaming Riot, and CertainlyT in particular for not communicating the goals of Morde&#039;s rework to us,\r\nBut times have changed, so has the game, and so did I, and I thought it was time to conclude the topic of Mordekaiser&#039;s Rework by neatly tying everything up with a nice little bow.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, without further ado, I&#039;ll start this off by saying this:\r\n#CertainlyT&#039;s approach to Mordekaiser&#039;s rework, while flawed in some aspects, was ingenious\r\n\r\n_________________________________________\r\n\r\n#Why was Mordekaiser chosen for this Juggernaut rework?\r\n\r\nSome of you may remember pre-rework Mordekaiser.\r\nA very obscure champion who, once you faced him, was no fun to play against.\r\nAt all.\r\n\r\nOld Mordekaiser was one of the meanest lane bullies with minimal counterplay.\r\nI liked to compare him to AP pantheon that doesn&#039;t fall off.\r\n\r\nMordekaiser&#039;s old solo lane was as uninteractive as it could be, mostly due to the play pattern he applied to molest his ~~victim~~ enemy laner.\r\nHe used to max his E, Siphon of Destruction, an AoE 250 base damage, low cd burst spell that was instant cast.\r\nWith his old passive generating 35% of the damage dealt into a shield and the heavy AoE aspect of his E Morde was untouchable.\r\n\r\nHe&#039;d just go about spamming E on the enemy laner without them being able to do anything against it.\r\nIf you didn&#039;t manage to out sustain him you were doomed, and all inning wasn&#039;t an option either because of his W&#039;s resistance buff and his Q&#039;s heavy single target burst.\r\n\r\nMost of the time the counterplay to Morde was turtling and surviving.\r\nBut it was easier said than done with him constantly using E for you to fall below 40% hp and die to a r+ignite.\r\n\r\nIt was absolutely toxic to play against as he lacked any windows of power and didn&#039;t interact with his laner at all.\r\nHe was doomed to mediocrity and left mostly untouched (disregarding the DFG &quot;compensation&quot; that lowered his hp/5 by SIX)\r\n\r\n\r\n#So why did CertainlyT put Mordekaiser into a duo lane?\r\nIt&#039;s pretty logical if you think about it.\r\n\r\nMordekaiser&#039;s identity back then wasn&#039;t just heavy lane bully but &quot;6v4 Carry&quot;, &quot;Pure damage, no utility&quot; and it was one that aligns really well with one class in particular:\r\nThe Bot lane Carry\r\n\r\nTrying to preserve Mordekaiser&#039;s carry potential and some of his core themes was one part of it, with the other being the addition of Interactivity.\r\n\r\nBehold:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnhlldaNp_Y\r\n\r\nProbably the best thing that came out of Mordekaiser&#039;s rework.\r\nHarvester of Sorrow Checklist:\r\nIntroduces windows of power to Mordekaiser through it being a lot of his damage and main survivability tool:✓\r\nIs thematically fitting for an undead Juggernaut that grows stronger as he feeds on his enemies pain and suffering: ✓\r\nHas a badass Metal name: ✓\r\n\r\n\r\nHarvester of Sorrow made Mordekaiser&#039;s lane a lot more interactive by giving him a reason to take risks and giving him clear windows of power.\r\nHe has to choose between the heavy AoE damage or heal, as reactivating it may cut down his DPS but being greedy may result in his demise.\r\n\r\nBy shifting most of his base kit&#039;s power into his W DoT and away from his E instant AoE Nuke Mordekaiser was given more skill expression and ways to truly show the mastery over the champion while also giving a HP based caster an actual way to regain the HP he lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nPutting him primarily bot lane was warranted too as in a solo lane he faced the problem of being extremely binary due to only providing damage and just relying on stomping the enemy laner to the point of them being irrelevant.\r\n\r\nBot lane introduced a lot more variables in the equation that is a healthier Mordekaiser gameplay.\r\nThere are FOUR players in total down there, distributing the load of interactivity evenly.\r\nThe enemy ADC has to know how to poke Morde and deny him\r\nThe enemy SUPPORT has to peel Morde and try deny him access to his ADC\r\nThe allied SUPPORT has to ENABLE Mordekaiser, giving him room to breathe to CS and providing the CC and/or utility for Morde to kill the enemy\r\n\r\nAnd of course Morde has to deal with 3 other people as he has to know how to trade, to all in, to farm, to poke and how to play the lane.\r\nAll the while staying true to his identity as heavy damage dealer with great survivability.\r\n\r\nA Juggernaut Carry\r\nIt was a big step towards a healthier Mordekaiser, and a healthier bot lane as it opened up more flexible team comps and carry champions bot\r\n____________________________________\r\n#So why is the Rework considered a failure?\r\n\r\nI always go on about how Morde&#039;s rework would&#039;ve been deemed a success if they had released him in his 6.1 state.\r\nMordekaiser&#039;s exponential Q damage had to be evened out in order to make it more reliable, increase counterplay and make it more satisfying\r\nW has to become castable on allied units in order to allow Mordekaiser to have the OPTION to solo lane as other carries can (Lucian, Vayne, etc.)\r\nDragon clone had to be tuned towards scaling better and being less obnoxious early game\r\n\r\n\r\nIF they had released Mordekaiser in this state he&#039;d be probably the best class update, besides maybe Vladimir.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut they didn&#039;t.\r\nAnd the way Riot took a long time to change him made people frustrated with the way they handled Mordekaiser\r\nWith my threads not really helping and painting a picture of a &quot;Doomed champion&quot; of one that was &quot;ruined&quot; even though he&#039;s become a lot better and once the dust settled he rose from the rubble stronger than before.\r\n\r\n\r\nMordekaiser&#039;s rework had the right ideas in mind but him still having some of his old toxic aspects in his kit like his passive being too strong at times and his R wraith being too feast or famine, coupled with outdated Visuals and VO puts him on the VGU list.\r\n\r\nBut does that mean Mordekaiser&#039;s Juggernaut rework is going to be wiped off the earth as they just try building Morde with a blank slate?\r\n\r\n\r\nCertainlyT had the right ideas and the only problem was that they lacked resources to further push this idea to its full potential.\r\nMordekaiser should be a damage Carry as every Mordekaiser main plays him for that aspect.\r\n\r\nWe want to be tough as nails while dealing extreme damage.\r\nMordekaiser isn&#039;t about utility, he&#039;s all about destroying those who stand in his path, meaning that cowards who flee can escape his grasp.\r\nHis theme fits that of an Undead warlord who conquers everything in sight and as every Juggernaut he works best when ENABLED by his team.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, will Mordekaiser still be this unholy bot lane Carry who&#039;ll snatch away the ADC&#039;s crown over the dominion of the bot lane carry position or will he be your stereotypical top lane bruiser with some CC, healing and negligible, unreliable damage?\r\nOnly time will tell, though Riot being unsure which path to tread on when reworking Mordekaiser makes me hopeful for an actual Mordekaiser VGU that truly puts him up there with other Carries.\r\n_________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nIn a way CertainlyT was in the right when reworking Mordekaiser and not really budging when pestered by people wanting Mordekaiser to be solely a solo laner.\r\nHe took a toxic waste of a champion and gave him a place in the game that does not come at the expense of someone&#039;s enjoyment, totally destroying their fun for 15+ minutes.\r\n\r\nInstead he gave Mordekaiser the OPTION to be played bot lane, where he&#039;s provided with everything he needs to truly Carry and fulfill his fantasy of Undying Revenant King who rules with a literal Iron fist.\r\n\r\nIf he had the time and resources to actually take this further I believe it would have been one of the greatest reworks after initial tweaking as currently Mordekaiser, as so many carry champions, can roll Solo and Duo, with both being successful.\r\nAnd as so many solo lane carries this comes with him not really providing his team with utility, which perfectly aligns with the true concept of a carry champion that has to be enabled to truly shine.\r\n\r\nSo, I wanted to apologize for the outrage and witchhunt that ensued after the Juggernaut Patch hit.\r\nAs in due time all the wrongs were turned into rights and Mordekaiser ended up being a total improvement over his old self.\r\nHealthier, more interactive and innovative.\r\n\r\nThank you, Bradford &#039;CertainlyT&#039; Wenban\r\n\r\n\r\n_____________________________\r\n-Malicious Metal, a Mordekaiser fanatic\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://apollo-pbe-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1441289547/Thank_You_For_Reading.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Over Innsmouth","date":"2017-10-10T11:03:19.769+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":1,"body":"> IF they had released Mordekaiser in this state he'd be probably the best class update, besides maybe Vladimir.\n\n{{sticker:vlad-salute}}","replies":[{"poster":"Pale Pirate","date":"2017-10-10T21:18:11.200+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"https://i.imgflip.com/mtfzf.jpg","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2017-10-10T11:55:15.051+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Give me a few minutes to purge some latent rage  I had over reading  the title\n\nEdit ok  good now.

That's obviously a Juggernaut, but if they can't get away with that, force him into the battlemage class. He feels a lot more like Vladimir than a normal Juggernaut anyways. \nHe shouldn't get any mobility with his rework, but a tad bit of CC would be perfect. Nothing crazy, but every other Juggernaut has some form of CC/mobility in their kits, so it's not asking too much. \nHe should keep some form of a \"ghost\" skill, but nothing like it is on live. Right now, it's very feast or famine, and usually just breaks Morde's kit if he gets a fed ADC.\nHis theme is perfect, keep it all, just enforce the undead, general of the Shadow Isles theme. \nThere isn't too much to keep in his kit, because it's so bland. Q is damage, W is damage and a heal, and E is damage.\n\n\n* Some CC as stated before. It could be a slow, a short stun, short root/snare, grounded, short knockup, anything would be fine, as long as it's not some long, hard CC.\nMore base stats! With his rework, I'm sure they would actually give him some Juggernaut base stats, something akin to Yorick (which is crazy, go look at his stats). I do have high hopes after seeing other Juggernaut's reworks like Urgot's and Yorick's.\nThere isn't much else I want added, I'm sure Riot could figure out something that works well and fits Morde's character.\n\n\n* I'm going with either STAYING or GOING, not really in between with his kit\n\n\n* His passive needs to be removed if we ever want Morde in a healthy state. Ever since release, his shield passive has always made him super toxic to play against. If you're ahead, you're unkillable. If you're behind, it doesn't really do anything. Because of his shield, he has to have the lowest HP regen in the game. For reference, Yorick has an 8 HP regen at level 1, Morde has 4. Yorick has 21.6 at level 18, and Morde has 9.1. A level 1 Yorick has almost as much HP regen as a level 18 Mordekaiser. Again, this is because of Morde's unhealthy combination of high sustain and shields. Because of his passive, he also has to have a really low armor and base HP (again, one of the lowest in the game). **Fun fact: during preseason, Morde will have the lowest base armor at level 1 in the game, all because Riot isn't compensating him as much as other champions for the loss of armor runes. Wooooo, Riot loves him.**\nDragon ghost needs to be removed, another feast or famine part of his kit that feels tacked on. Most of the time, the dragon doesn't even work, so who cares. It's either too strong or too weak (when the AI decides).\nRemove the EXP passive, another tacked on thing for a champion who almost only goes into solo lanes. It's just there, and doesn't even do much in duo lanes either.","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2017-10-11T05:09:04.084+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, This I like.

If you remember old Yorick ghost was just an ally version of Children of the Grave so I would be willing to put money on them changing the ghost in a similar way.  A Red post a long while back mentioned that York and Morse were a pain because every new champ made them need to update the ghosts for the game to function.  Do you remember when Morde was disabled due to a bug with Ornn?  I would hazard a guess that a ghost was not made, this causing the bug.","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2017-11-02T03:21:23.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with having it on his passive is it gives him the ability to create a 4v6 as early as level 1.

Magic damage/decent burst. It sets him apart from other juggernauts, and I think it actually allows him to serve as a niche pick in high elos (unlike most other juggernauts). In terms of specific abilities, I'd like his ult to stay most of all or at least something similar to it. I'd prefer to keep his Q and passive as well, but not as high priority.\n\n2. Some cc, more upfront tankiness (rather than relying on W heal)\n\n3. W, E\n\n4. Can't think of anything I actively hate to want gone, but yeah, just W and E I would be fine with losing.\n\nAs an overarching goal, I'm hoping they're able to keep him viable in both low level and high level play, maybe to serve as a model for other juggernauts. Other juggernauts like Yorick and Darius are great in lower elo but have no chance being seen in pro play nowadays. It would be great if he could serve as an alternate carry in bot lane too, but a lot of mains don't like that, so I wouldn't push it too much.","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2017-10-14T03:41:50.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***Keep:***\n- Magic damage burst (Juggernaut Niche)\n- Ult type of ability\n- Passive (low priority)\n- Q (low Priority)\n- Bot lane viability (low priority)\n- - Thematic\n\n***Add:***\n- CC\n- Non-heal durability\n- Cross-elo Viability\n\n***Indifferent:***\n- W\n- E\n\n\n***Remove:***\n- None\n\n------------------\n\nGot it.

Keep nothing. Let's rebuild him from the ground up as a mobile marksman.\n\n2. Ranged autos. We should swap out his mace for a bow. We'd then need to lighten up his armor significantly to suit his new, more dexterous style. Next thing he needs is some dashes, we need a new benchmark for mobile carries. I think each ability he has should have some sort of mobility and CC attached, but in return, his damage would be way lower than a normal ADC. Kinda like what Ashe is intended to trade off for her utility, but even more. Naturally, he'd be squishy, but that's just balancing.\n\n3. Nothing, I'm pretty for or against stuff.\n\n4. Death themes. He's way too grimdark in this game. Maybe we could brighten up his armor, add a rainbow in his kit, make him way happier. Also, those metal references. So 2000s.
