He's a demon dude.\r\nOn first glance you see the quintessential demonic warrior; red skin, wings, horns and a demonic weapon.\r\n\r\nWell maybe his kit's unique.... well...\r\nNot entirely; Aatrox's kit is just a dive-fighter kit you could slap on literally any other champion and there wouldn't be a lot of thematic clashes.\r\nThat's right, Aatrox's kit is disappointingly mediocre and a cookie-cutter cutout, so much that it's almost sad.\r\n\r\n**Aatrox is a demonic entity that inspires battle spirit on the losing side of the war and allows them to overcome any odds and be victorious  **\r\nAatrox's lore makes him out to be almost a support-ish type of character, a savior of sorts.\r\nHe sweeps in, helping out the losing side and spurring them to commit Aatrocities they only realize after the bloodshed.\r\nFor victory comes with a price; bloodlust, regrets and knowing that you committed ultimate sins of war.\r\n\r\nAatrox is just like Tahm Kench, he's a demon that thrives on human emotion and his type of \"pact\"'s not entirely different from Tahm's.\r\nTahm offers you absolution and a new beginning, only to later on take everything from you whereas Aatrox offers swift immediate victory but life long regrets and bloodlust\r\n\r\n**Does that mean Aatrox should be a support?!**\r\nNO! The last time Riot pushed a fighter champ bot lane was an outrage and this should never happen again.\r\nBut what could be done to Aatrox?\r\n\r\nSimple; Aatrox should be all about inspiring his allies to fight harder and provide strong combat buffs.\r\nHe's a diving fighter, which he should remain. We don't want a Tank Aatrox.\r\n\r\nAatrox should be all about diving into the enemy team and inspiring his allies to follow his lead and fight at his side.\r\n\r\nImagine Aatrox diving into the enemy ranks with his dark flight, his wings like a torn cape as he lands in the enemy front line, surrounded by the opposition waiting to tear him to pieces.\r\nBut instead of dying and submitting he swings his demonic sword, the Battle being his canvas, his Sword his painting brush, Blood his colors.\r\n**This battle will be his masterpiece**\r\n\r\nThe mere sight of such a powerful entity joining you to overcome a much stronger enemy fills you with battle fervor and the will to survive!\r\n\r\nAatrox should be all about inspiring his allies to fight alongside him, leading the charge as he dives the enemy. Almost suicidal but keeping alive in the midst of battle by increasingly stronger lifesteal and perhaps even strong combat buffs getting stronger the longer the battle rages on.\r\n\r\n\r\n>Aatrox's core problem is the lack of thematic cohesion and him lacking unique factors that truly paint him as the demonic entity inspiring the losing side to carry on and prevail\r\n\r\nSure, giving Aatrox Sion's old ultimate would be fitting but why go back to something that was broken and unintuitive and toy with other ideas we can add to our Darkin Blade.\r\nBe it AD/AS team buffs, Armor/MR buffs, MS when moving in his direction, his life steal spreading to nearby allies, him emitting auras, etc.\r\n\r\nThe possibilities are limitless and I don't think I'm qualified enough to make any more assumptions on what Aatrox \"really\" needs.\r\n\r\n~M.M\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/0MtwhZp.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"DarKnight20685","date":"2016-03-12T17:33:50.281+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2016-03-12T17:34:57.089+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woo, someone noticed!","replies":[{"poster":"roar2001","date":"2016-03-12T22:19:44.697+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I laughed so hard when I read it!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kaleidos","date":"2016-03-12T11:01:13.593+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, it always really bugged me that Aatrox's lore flat out said he was this entity that would pimp into a battle, throw the losing side into a complete blood frenzy, and then get in the middle of it and just go to town on the winning side before leaving.\n\nThen his kit came out and he's just a super generic diver who does nothing to aid his allies, not to mention we have a glimpse of how Aatrox's influence actually works since Tryndamere is a living example of the aftermath and yet Aatrox shares no mechanical similarities to Tryndamere in the slightest.\n\nYou'd think Aatrox would also use Fury and get progressively stronger as his health depletes, and possibly have a similar Undying Rage-esque feel (His Blood Well could've easily been flavored as being exactly that instead of... well, being the Blood Well , and they didn't do that for some reason), but nope he uses a seemingly random thematic for his resource, passive, and ultimate that have nothing to do with how he was described to us as in his lore.","replies":[{"poster":"Quort","date":"2016-03-12T17:06:23.086+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aatrox doesn't work well with Fury.

He brings nothing to his team that Xin, Yi, Wukong, Garen, or any other melee fighter doesn't bring and has huge kit problems that do not synergize well with each other.\n\nHe is extremely squishy for his class and has no defensive steroid like most of his class has. He does regenerate SOME health through W....after 3 hits and all health regenerated is instantly spent to fuel other abilities. His Q is an awful gap closer for a diver since it can get rooted, stunned, knock backed, etc. and is also fairly easy to dodge and would be better off with a point and click gap closer like almost every other diver has (or give him Malphite ult treatment/ANY other dash in the game treatment on Q).\n\nHis kit just doesn't do well with itself. He is punished for buying health with higher costs and less \"effective\" healing from W (100 hp every 3rd hit isn't shit if you have 3000 health) BUT he has to build more bulky than the rest of his class since if he gets CC'ed he dies. Xin has a steroid in his ult that gives a good amount of resists and Yi has Meditate to block damage and R to make him unkiteable.\n\nIf Riot doesn't want Aatrox getting too defensive and to be able to work as a squishier melee fighter he basically NEEDS Olaf's CC immunity to work since it probably wouldn't make him too TERRIBLY broken on him since he can still get kited fairly easily due to no reliable gap closer and other reasons.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2016-03-12T20:47:45.548+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Aatrox' problem is that he's basically a manaless Jax with sustain and poke or a manaless Irelia with AoE CC and poke.\n\nI can see no way to make that kit impactful without making it awful to play against.\n\nGuy needs a ground up rework.","replies":[{"poster":"Nahara","date":"2016-03-13T01:30:53.389+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would be nice of Riot did a rework of the \"diving fighter\" class, but aside from Irelia, Jax, and Aatrox, who would that encompass?","replies":[{"poster":"OneSmoothDude","date":"2016-03-13T03:50:18.266+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could also include Diana, Fiora, Jarvan, Yi, Olaf, Pantheon, Renek, Shyv, Tryn, Vi, Voli, Wukong, and Xin. \n\nSome of those are a stretch or might fit into another category better (Diana = assassin, Voli = tank, etc.), for sure.

The kit essentially revolves around making Aatrox this sustained-combat fighter that happens to excel in teamfights thanks to potent AOE, healing, and his passive revive actually being relevant.  Important parts of the text are boldened.  This is a **CONCEPT**, so don't worry about numbers.\n\n----------------------\n\nBase HP increased to 570.8\nBase Attack Speed increased to .668\n\nPassive - Blood Well: All self inflicted damage is stored into the Blood Well. Upon taking fatal damage, Aatrox enters a stasis and begins draining his Blood Well, healing himself and **nearby allied champions** over the next 3 seconds. The amount of health restored is equal to 35% of the Blood Well's content limit, plus its amount of stored health upon activation.  Allied champions are healed for 75% of the health Aatrox gains while reviving.  \n\nQ - Dark Flight: Aatrox takes flight and slams down at the target area after a brief delay, dealing physical damage to nearby enemies upon landing and **knocking up enemies based on their proximity to where Aatrox landed, for up to 1 second.**\n\nW - Blood Thirst: Whenever Aatrox deals physical damage to an enemy champion they gain a stack of Cursed Blood for 4 seconds. An enemy can have up to 5 stacks of Cursed Blood on them at once. Upon activation Aatrox draws in the blood of nearby enemies afflicted with Cursed Blood, consuming one stack of Cursed Blood each second while dealing magic damage and slowing enemies.  Aatrox is healed for a percentage of damage dealt (before resistances).  Healing against minions (potentially monsters too) is reduced by 50%.\n\nE - Blood Price/Impalement:\n\nPassive - Blood Price: Every third basic attack Aatrox deals bonus physical damage.  Against champions this attack costs HP but ignores a % of their bonus armor.\n\nActive - Impalement: Aatrox's next basic attack pierces through the primary target, dealing physical damage to the target and opponents behind it in a line. This attack can apply Blood Price's bonus physical damage to all enemies struck.\n\nR - Massacre: Aatrox draws in the blood of his foes, dealing magic damage and filling his Blood Well by 20% for each enemy champion hit.  Additionally, Aatrox gains bonus attack speed, bonus attack range, and his attacks deal 75% of their damage in a cone centered around his target.\n\n-------------------------------\n\n**NOTES:** \n\n* In my opinion Aatrox's Q animation should be sped up a little so it is harder to interrupt.  The knock-up works like Rek'Sai W.\n \n* Aatrox's W can be activated before Blood Well procs and it would continue to deal damage, slow enemies, and heal him while in stasis.  Cursed Blood stacks are applied by the AOE from Massacre and his E's line damage.  Also applies to Titanic Hydra and Ravenous Hydra.  \"All Physical Damage\".  Worth mentioning that this ability would probably have a tether that one can break from or something.\n \n* Aatrox's E passive is essentially his current W blood price toggle with added bonus armor penetration so he can stay relevant versus different targets.  \n \n* Think of his E's active like Lucian's Q, but on an auto-attack.  You target the enemy, it hits everything in a line.\n\n------------------------------------\n**POTENTIAL PITFALLS:**\n\n* Doesn't fit the \"Inspiring conqueror when all hope is lost\" theme as well as it could.  Originally the idea was an aura on his Ultimate that made all damage dealt to champions from Aatrox and nearby allies heal them for a % of damage dealt, but after some reflection it seemed that it would be a very snowbally concept.\n\n* Not unique enough: See above^.  It would be cool for an ability to directly make allies stronger somehow but I cannot think of a way in which it would be impactful without just having big numbers.  Please inform me, and together we can make Aatrox great again!\n\n* He may still end up too easily kited, which in turn would leave him weak because a lot of his damage **SHOULD** be through DPS rather than a burst as the game progresses (this is ok early, but auto-attacking a lot is part of what makes Aatrox's gameplay).","replies":[{"poster":"Messaiga","date":"2016-03-13T16:10:21.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aaaaaaaaand this is why I don't bother.

Sure he's underpowered, but that's because he generally has to be with the type of kit he has... it would be extremely unhealthy for him to receive any buffs with his current set-up. If you want a change, than they'd need to do a decent-sized scale rework, which usually involves changing lore, champion model et cetera. \n\n> Well maybe his kit's unique.... well...\nNot entirely; Aatrox's kit is just a dive-fighter kit you could slap on literally any other champion and there wouldn't be a lot of thematic clashes.\nThat's right, Aatrox's kit is disappointingly mediocre and a cookie-cutter cutout, so much that it's almost sad.\n\nYou mention this, but then you say this...\n\nA dive-fighter kit can't be changed much without feeling too weird or over/underpowered. But that's besides the point, Aatrox isn't even a dive fighter, he's a sustain duelist and a split pusher.\n\n>He's a diving fighter, which he should remain. We don't want a Tank Aatrox.\n\nI disagree with the former quote, Aatrox's kit is unique and it does fit with his lore. \n\nThe first paragraph in his lore is this \n\n> Aatrox is a legendary warrior, one of only five that remain of an ancient race known as the Darkin. He wields his massive blade with grace and poise, slicing through legions in a style that is hypnotic to behold. With each foe felled, Aatrox's seemingly living blade drinks in their blood, empowering him and fueling his brutal, elegant campaign of slaughter.\n\nThis fits perfectly so far, with how Aatrox looks and feels in the game. I especially feel like Aatrox embodies his lore moreso than other champions, his blade quivers and twitches, his blade makes a high pitched noise as it readies for the third strike of blood thirst as well as using it, and it makes a lower pitched noise as it readies for the third hit of blood price and also as it uses it. He looks like an ancient race and a legendary warrior, his head-piece looks amazing, he has tattered dark wing-banners with armor that looks to be fused with flesh. The way he attacks also feels smooth and elegant, it makes him feel like an artisan rather than someone who does a hack-job. And if you've ever seen an Aatrox dive into a team, press R and go to town, he indeed drinks blood, dealing large amounts of damage and sustaining lots of return fire.\n\n>Aatrox is a demonic entity that inspires battle spirit on the losing side of the war and allows them to overcome any odds and be victorious \nAatrox's lore makes him out to be almost a support-ish type of character, a savior of sorts.\nHe sweeps in, helping out the losing side and spurring them to commit Aatrocities they only realize after the bloodshed.\nFor victory comes with a price; bloodlust, regrets and knowing that you committed ultimate sins of war.\n\n>Aatrox is just like Tahm Kench, he's a demon that thrives on human emotion and his type of \"pact\"'s not entirely different from Tahm's.\nTahm offers you absolution and a new beginning, only to later on take everything from you whereas Aatrox offers swift immediate victory but life long regrets and bloodlust\n\nThis is a misconception that will lead you astray as to what Aatrox really is. He's not a demon, he's a darkin. The lore doesn't make Aatrox out to be a support-ish character, it makes **Aatrox** look like a bloodthirsty elusive legendary warmonger who is one of a handful of his kind remaining. His main goal isn't to thrive on human emotion, but rather--in the baseness of his actions---kill things. He undeniably does have an influence on people however, by inspiring them to the same frenzy he's worked up to no doubt, but it's not his main goal. Aatrox is and isn't like Tahm Kench. He is like Tahm, because Aatrox has an insatiable appetite albeit different, much like Kench. But they're different because Aatrox isn't a demon, he doesn't thrive on human emotion persay, just war. He doesn't offer pacts, he just joins wars and inadvertently ends up negatively influencing the side he's fighting for.\n\nAll in all I'd say that Aatrox is a pretty unique, healthy champion. Though with his current lore/kit it's impossible to buff him or change him around without making him over-powered, or reworking him potentially into an Aatrox we won't know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDevice","date":"2016-03-12T17:17:04.630+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I 90% agree with everything you said.\n\nI am still not entirely sold on the idea that Aatrox needs to provide buffs to the team. Its just not a interesting mechanic to any champion who's not a true support imo. Not fun. \n\nThis is my main issue with him aswell; He's only partially fun to play. \n\nI've said this far too many times already but here it goes again:\n\nAatrox should be redesigned into a caster type champion like a true melee version of {{champion:8}} instead of a Xin Zhao / Tryndamere ripoff. He should be in the same category as {{champion:92}} {{champion:114}}, a mobile light fighter caster (in between a juggernaut and assassin) which is already so few in number compared to the the role Aatrox is competing for: the attack speed backdoor fighter (there are like 12 of them)\n\nI just don't understand why he's being smushed into this cookie cutter role. Why does he have to be attack speed based? If he's meant to primarily be a dive fighter or teamfight-based.. why give him a backdoorers kit? And to me its just a very bland and boring playstyle lol. I hit you lots is pretty much his kit. \n\nThree passive effects (counting the ult passive after activation) just to make up for his lack of base stats? Just so he can maybe build a little tanky just to maybe survive some heavy cc fights? He has a very contradictory kit just to fit this role thats entirely overpopulated. \n\nMy suggestion: Rework. Not a huge one but definately something that will redefine his playstyle a bit. He can be an actual dive fighter. Riven is a dive fighter. Why are there so many champions like {{champion:5}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:2}} etc etc etc when there are so few champions like Riven and Fiora? Mobile light fighers who are caster based and can dish out a lot of burst damage and use caster-type mechanics to sustain instead of relying on the ever-boring aa lifesteal. \n\n{{champion:266}} \"Don't cc me cuz the only way im going to do anything this fight is if i attack you lots k?

I usually feel bad for doing it, since his kit is incredible \"feast/famine,\" and there's always a better champion I could've picked. \n\nAlso, although his kit does have synergy within it self, it also fights itself a lot. The biggest example is the fact that he needs health to survive a fight, but that health gets wasted with his %HP costs on his abilities. \n\nAnother problem is his passive; a self-revive is such a strong ability that it forces Riot to make him weaker to compensate. And, because of this, whenever his revive goes off, he's pretty much useless. As it is now, it's only use is to allow him to escape in the lane phase, or delay his death in a teamfight. These are in no way bad, but looking at someone like Anivia or Zac, who are actually useful in a fight after they revive, Aatrox's revive just feels lackluster.\n\nFinally, the pure simplicity of his kit mixed with extreme reliance on his abilities that have fairly long cooldowns makes him extremely difficult to play against these other high mechanic champions. His Q and W are pretty difficult to land if your enemies know anything about sidestepping, yet are VERY punishing if EITHER of them are missed. Even if they do hit, he's still kited pretty easily. \n\nI really wish he wasn't so \"relatively new\" as a champion, because I feel like he deserves a full scale rework to better deliver his theme with his kit, while also making it competitive in comparison to those of similar champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Neamean","date":"2016-03-14T05:12:34.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just because he is fairly new doesn't mean he can't get rework I mean just look at Quinn who only came out a few month before him she got a rework.","replies":[{"poster":"48983507DEL1","date":"2016-03-14T21:50:30.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Their official statement on Aatrox was that there are other champions that are in more need of a rework than he is.","replies":[{"poster":"Neamean","date":"2016-03-14T23:30:01.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But they also stated that he might be a high contender to be in the diver class rework if they decide to work on Divers.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ChaosThief","date":"2016-03-14T19:32:38.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like if they wanted to push him in this direction, it would probably be best to allow him to debuff his enemies, which lets aatrox (and his allies) hurt them more, or heal of hurting them, etc.\n\nAnd his current passive should stay.

This means his power is DIRECTLY reliant on his items, cause without them he can't engage without being blown up and can't safely deal damage due to him being a melee champ, which means he is the pinnacle of stack-checking!\n\nDoes he have more items then you?  He does?  Then he wins!  Or he doesn't?  Then you win!\n\nOnly reason he's seeing SOME resurgence is cause devourer+rageblade+steraks is an absolutely OP as fuck item combination on many champs, which means he doesn't need as many stats to win a stat-check fight.\n\nSo yeah a better champion identity will help with his popularity and probably some balancing as well, but that won't fix him, his kit just does not work well with his stats.\n\nThey either need to give him a more reliable tool to deal damage from a safe(ish) distance, so we won't be punished for building as his base stats say he should, or change his base stats to more match his kit so he can make proper use of it without being punished should he not have the items to offset the imbalance.\n\nI made a thread a very long time ago for a possible rework where he'd be a hard engaging tank that worked through sustain, but mainly sustain through abilities and positioning instead of auto attacks, and I think it captured his identity very well while still being very unique.  It ofc didn't get much attention at all so it's long gone, but I still believe they need to make some drastic changes in order for him to be truly viable without relying on items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"charcharmunro","date":"2016-03-12T11:46:07.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really feel like he should be more like...
