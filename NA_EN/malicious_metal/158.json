Pretty much every mage has to build some mana and mana sustain. 250 isnt enough, and it offers no sustain for mana.\n\n**Second**, only 10% CDR... again on Lich B. I guess not being able to spam any of your spells will help since your going to be mana starved.\n\n**Third**, no HP, mages are squishy, and they can be killed very quickly. Its why many of their items come with HP, so they can live long enough to take a hit or two to get a rotation off.\n\n**Fourth**, that build will put most mages into a range they arnt safe at. Coupled with the above point that it offers no additional survivability the nesesity to get close enough for Gunblade and Lich B. aa proc will get them killed. If it will get them killed to get that close they cant make use of it.\n\nSo you put together items for a mage that will offer them not enough mana, not enough CDR, no health, and requires them to put themselves to close to the action and say they cant complain... OK, I LOL'd.\n\nA significant portion of the build (to get extra burst) revolves around Lich B. Its not a good item on most mages. \"But {{champion:115}} he duz eet\" Yes, and Ziggs has an aa that burns down towers hard, and Lich B. works on towers, it works for him to siege faster. He isnt using it on people as much as towers.The main reason you dont see Lich B. on most mages is because their AA is just for killing minions and hitting towers.

Some interesting data:\n-It does not appear that the splash is applied by the bolts, as I suspected.\nThat said, I did 2 tests:\nTest 1: Single target DPS\nTest 2: Splash+Runaan's bolts v just Splash (my build)\n\nFor both tests, I set myself to level 14, and maxed E, Q, and had 2 points in W and R, I only used E for the tests however.\nI would stand in melee range and DPS the target dummy, running threw a few cycles of the entire E duration and brief remainder of CD to get a good average DPS, for the 2nd test, I had 3 dummies right next to each other so that I could compare splash as well.\n\nFindings:\nSingle target DPS: For your build was about 550, for my build, it was about 500. So you have a 10% advantage in single target DPS.\nSplash: In the splash test, main target DPS mirror single target DPS for both builds (this shows that {{item:3085}} bolts do _not_ apply Righteous Fury splash), the Secondary targets would take both Runaan's bolts and splash from the main target. Total DPS to them was about 500 with your build, and about 250 with mine (just splash). This means that with your build, DPS from Runaan's bolts and from splash was about 50-50 to secondary targets (provided, ofc, that they are within the 150 radius of the main target).\n\nConclusion:\nAlthough your build does possess higher DPS, it's only by about 10%, and you have no healing what so ever in the item build. I have 15% healing from all damage (1/3 effective on AoE damage), which means that I would've been healing approximately 75 HP/S due to my DPS against the target dummy. Without even factoring in armor and magic resist, this is enough that my build would win a duel with yours (your effective DPS if I had 0 resists would be less than mine, and I actually had about 70 ar and 30 mr). This, while also having more AP, and hence better damage with Q, better healing and MS from W, and the synergy of being able to healing from my DPS while ulting myself (plus the handy active, which adds to my burst, slows, and also heals me for 15% of its damage). All things put together, I think the numbers and tests came out pretty strongly in my build's favor.

If you melee auto attack that target while they are marked you deal damage equal to the live value, and maybe ignore x% of their resists on the second chunk of damage, helping hybrid champs out a lil' bit on the damage side to make up for it being riskier and backloaded?  \n\nDunno if the resist ignoring part is even needed, but I wanted a way to make the damage more valuable because it now has a much larger risk associated with it, and actual counter play beyond not getting within range, but at the same time, I don't think the damage value itself should be increased much if at all.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tyrone Lannister","date":"2017-04-17T00:29:35.629+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that Kat, LB and Akali build it.
