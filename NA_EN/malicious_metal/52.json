It's early sucks dick, going the build CertainlyT and the rest of Riot wants you to build makes it to where you're useless late game due to Hybrid damage (Literally, they made him magic damage and want him to build AD/Tank, so he can't even put to use a damn Cleaver like a normal AD Fighter), and his mid game is easily shut down before he even gets there by simply having a knock back. Morde needs to WALK to his target. Walk to them. No gap closer or CC, so he has to chase them. If the enemies get an Alistar, Syndra, Xin, or an Anivia (Wall of super denial), the Morde is completely screwed. You can still screw him with normal stuff like slows since he's stupid easy to kite, thus needing his team to do ANYTHING and your only damaging ability is your Q since the E's scaling is iffy at best as the build they want you to go unless you get plenty of AD, but their build says tanky AD. They want a TANK. Like, their recommended items that they're balancing around is Ninja Tabi, Trinity Force, Rylai's, Gunblade, Spirit Visage, and another tanky item. It's... It does a lot of damage, but at the same time, it... it just doesn't scale to late due to being hybrid/tanky. The Q will do around 1kish in total, but you only attack at about 1 per sec, so it takes 3s to do 1k damage and your opponent has to stand still for that ENTIRE time, so it could take upwards of 4-5s to get it off on a moving target. \n\nHis kit is scaled so nearly all of his power in his Q. His E is just for shields and the slow with Rylai's, possible for use in farming early on if you're being zoned (Which is common since he's melee with 325 movement speed) and his bases are HORRIBLE, so he doesn't do anything early on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ArkenStorm","date":"2015-08-10T21:06:49.278+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have: it sucks.\nUnless you are in a mirror lane, where it is then decided by skill, it sucks horribly. doesn't solve any problems old mordy had, introduces new ones, and he is now significantly weaker in a solo lane due to the lack of an ability, and less aoe(from q change)","replies":[{"poster":"The Fast","date":"2015-08-11T21:39:01.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Out of curiosity, what did you build?","replies":[{"poster":"ArkenStorm","date":"2015-08-12T03:12:24.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"in the mirror lane or vs an ADC?

I never had problems with last hitting, just every adc I played against was able to out-harass me by a lot(vayne, cait, varus, draven)\n\nHonestly my big problem with the rework is that it FORCED morde into a duo lane. It didn't really solve the problems that he had before(super oppressive to melee, can barely do anything to ranged), and it goes against him thematically as well. As others have said, why does the Murder emperor need to rely on anyone else to be completely useful? He is the master of metal, THE MURDER EMPEROR. he shouldn't *need* to rely on anyone else. I think if he was able to work with someone else but not be totally reliant on them(aka work in duo but still be fully useful solo) that would be great.
