He loves being his team&#039;s main source of damage and likes duking it out in what I&#039;d call the Mid-line, dwelling just a bit further behind the frontline but not being a backline artillery like Xerath.\r\n\r\nThe champions that I think share Morde&#039;s role in a team are {{champion:8}} {{champion:50}} , with them being huge damage threats that can take quite the beating but prefer being enabled by their team, though they very much can do stuff on their own (Unlike current Mordekaiser).\r\n\r\nSo, Tl;DR Mordekaiser thematic lends itself best for a Battlemage-like gameplay fantasy where he strikes a firm middle ground between a true frontline fighter and an AoE Mage.\r\nMordekaiser always embodied this duality theme of having wicked strong Melee range damage but being able to dish out tons of damage in a moderately high threat range of around 500ish range.\r\n\r\n#Bot, Mid, Top, Jungle?!! Sopportekaiser???\r\nA very interesting topic is where people would like to see Mordekaiser being played, with some bickering why X is better than Y and why person A is a Numbnut for wanting Y instead of X.\r\n\r\nI personally think Mid lane seems like the safest bet, for several reasons;\r\nA) It is a lane mostly associated with heavy AoE Magic damage\r\nB) Mordekaiser, as a carry, likes being the center of attention and get a lot of resources, which mid provides with XP, Gold and strategic positioning\r\nC) It just fits him thematically, being that commanding Conqueror who sees himself as being above everyone else, a true Overlord\r\n\r\nBut just like Irelia&#039;s VGU, Morde should not be pigeonholed into one position.\r\nNo, Riot should look at his thematics and gameplay fantasy and just deliver on this Heavy Metal Doombringer, people will play him wherever they feel they have the most success.\r\nJust look at champions that can be played Mid, Top, and maybe after the Mid-season patch even Bot; {{champion:13}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:69}} \r\n\r\n#Itemization?!\r\nWhile I love hybridity, Mordekaiser should not be built with that in mind, instead he should still be able to opt into a wide variety of items without feeling like he has just ONE core build.\r\nWhile I personally run something like this right now {{item:3116}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3165}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3089}} , people should be able to opt into different builds depending on the current situation and the role they want to fill {{item:3146}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3053}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3151}} \r\n\r\nI love variety and Riot shouldn&#039;t enforce one cookie cutter build by either cutting the AP or AD ratios.\r\nPlus, total AD ratios make Morde scale naturally, even if he&#039;s feeding his ass off.\r\n\r\n\r\n#Mechanics that should get preserved, scrapped or just reworked in general?\r\nHonestly, at this point I think ALL of Morde&#039;s current mechanics should be wiped in favor of Riot building spells off thematics.\r\nJust like Irelia, Morde&#039;s skills should embody different facets of his character identity and deliver on them in a way that doesn&#039;t feel toxic for the game&#039;s health.\r\nSo, if I had to narrow it down to two aspects, it&#039;d be;\r\nA) Soulstealing, as in ripping the very essence of his enemies out of their bodies and enslaving them\r\nThis can be implemented in way more intuitive ways than his current Children of the Grave, which just fulfills too many functions at once while also being a &quot;win more&quot; kind of ability. \r\nB) Durability through combat. Just like Swain, Vladimir, Darius and Illaoi, Mordekaiser thrives in the thick of battle, where he leeches his foes&#039; life-force to sustain himself, this needs to stay as it makes Mordekaiser function as a Battlemage/Juggernaut hybrid, be it through healing, shielding, or a mix of both!\r\n\r\n#Health costs?\r\nSmall subcategory here, but should Mordekaiser retain his HP costs?\r\nCurrently they feel tacked on and don&#039;t serve a real gating purpose as they&#039;re all flat as well as him having a huge heal in his kit.\r\nIf they were to remain they need to be either more intuitive or just work better with his kit in general.\r\nOr, you know, just make him resource-less &gt;:/\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://68.media.tumblr.com/0c7774ef20601d953e4dafcad10017c7/tumblr_ou380qh5eY1u1jwg6o3_r1_400.gif\r\n\r\nBut that&#039;s just some of my thoughts on how Mordekaiser&#039;s Gameplay fantasy should be refined in his VGU just like Irelia got hers fleshed out and truly delivered on.\r\n\r\nAs always, let me know your own thoughts, always happy to talk about Mordekaiser.","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-03-21T16:13:59.657+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"All I want is for them to get rid of bot Morde and the whole \"no CC/no mobility\" thing.

They put too many restraints on their design and probably didn't full flesh out the possibilities since they wanted to keep his \"iconic\" traits alive (His ult, health costs, immobile, no CC, high damage, damage to shield conversion).\n\nThey need to actually try removing some of these aspects and implementing other mechanics to truly find a kit that fits Mordekaiser's theme rather than a kit that fits his current kit (last part sounds redundant, but that's pretty much what they did).\n\nNever agreed with the whole \"He shouldn't have any CC\" thing as a preset rule in his design. Balancing an immobile, CC-less, entirely damage reliant Juggernaut just SOUNDS like a balance nightmare to begin with (his damage/tankiness has to be overtuned enough/reliable enough for him to be viable).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Over Innsmouth","date":"2018-03-21T16:22:55.335+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I look forward to when Riot tackles Mordekaiser in 2023.\n\n> **Health costs?**\nSmall subcategory here, but should Mordekaiser retain his HP costs?\n\nYes, I believe so at least. Part of it is personal appeal, I like health costs even if they don't really manifest in gameplay (when was the last time you decided against using an ability as a HP Caster because you were afraid of the health cost?).  I like the idea of using up health to fuel spells and abilities, simple as that.\n\nThe other part is that they're thematically fulfilling and appealing. It reinforces the idea that you're playing a blood mage who weaponizes blood and fuels it with blood, or the idea that you dominate, claim, and use souls as fuel, or that you're nothing but an artificial life form with your wits and your green goo on the Rift.\n\nThat and, as far as I know Riot has never changed the resources of a Champion. Even Aatrox is still technically a HP Caster with the piddly 30 cost on his E and nothing else.","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2018-03-21T16:29:04.050+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Biased Vlad main, **reeeee**!\n\nWell, if they keep 'em around they better actually deliver on the whole \"Soul fuel\" premise of him siphoning his own essence and his foes' to achieve his goals of eternal conquest.","replies":[{"poster":"Over Innsmouth","date":"2018-03-21T16:43:16.804+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soul fuel or sole fool?","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2018-03-21T18:41:04.741+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:136}} Sol Food.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2018-03-21T18:55:59.529+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> C) It just fits him thematically, being that commanding Conqueror** who sees himself as being above everyone else,** a true Overlord\n\nShouldn't that make him botlaner :^)","replies":[{"poster":"A treespook nest","date":"2018-03-21T20:04:51.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bot lane I think is the best place for him. :/ I hope they don’t take him away from that when he gets reworked.","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2018-03-21T20:47:15.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're opening up botlane for mage picks, so if he can roll mid he can definitely be played bot.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2018-03-21T18:39:38.857+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always envisioned Mordekaiser as a slow moving metal juggernaut that couldn't be stopped (as death itself but less about \"hunting\" as Kindred, rather more about the inevitability).

He lacks the key trait of a juggernaut which is being able to charge into the enemy team alone and still possess great threat. i.e. Darius, nasus etc.\nHow he plays out right now is very weird. His primary role is like a support healer/soft cc zoner with secondary as a followup burster that requires initiators. How well you can do depends way too heavily on your support or jungler. Though he can be played as a healbait machine, it requires silly and bad enemy players to do so.\nThe shield he has is pretty much non existent in much more competitive games.\nI honestly think that the ap itemization that he is binded to pretty much hurts him more than he can benefit from. Rylai/gunblade core prevents him from getting a cc in kit. While everyone doesnt need a core to function well. AA resets cannot be done with items and is specifically locked for 1 auto after q3. Q is somewhat attack speed locked after 40% atk speed.\n\nHis ult needs to be gone and never made sense to his theme and is poorly done/designed. I have always hated his ult even long ago when i played started playing him. Its way too feast or famine. Its so bad that it ends up as a completely useless skill most of the time. Way too conditional and easily counterplayed.\nEverytime morde is good is because of runes and itemization that allows him to do meaningful damage at very specifc stages of the game to win games.\n\nI hope he can be turned into a unique tanky battlemage hypercarry that he once was.\nIm still upset that he went fotm one day and got gutted to oblivion, being turned into a squishy mage by guinsoo then outclassed by every mage just to cater to the horrible playerbase back then.\nHe has remained very obsolete through all the way due to the badly outdated kit.\nI would have preferred him turned into a true tank with the damage soak, living long in teamfights and pumping out respectable damage while constantly recharging his shield.\nMorde desperately needs some form of cc immunity and hard cc to play from behind and protect himself.\nFor example, his q could be changed to swing his mace horizontally in wide arc 2x and the final blow is a vertical slam which knock units away from impact spot.\nFully charging his shield with make him glow with cc immunity.\nHis iconic siphon should suck out the life force of the enemy stealing movement speed from afflicted. It fits his theme and makes his enemies suffer.\nHis ult should be changed to being able to revive dead players/cannons/big monsters to control as pets after channeling as a hotfix to his current kit for the w combo.\n\nMost importantly he needs skill expression by micro not macro solely to win games.\nBad rotations in map screws him up badly especially due to his low movespeed.\nThe most fun time I had was when he could use s6 youmuu ghostblade + stormraiders and hard carry through skill rather than outstating damage checks/poke. The backline pussy poke/burst mage whos waiting for decent team mate to initiate is not really fun or fair to play with.\nWinning by macro game, might as well play other champs without huge handicaps.\nHis low movespeed makes him the backline even when you are trying to go frontline.\nHe has a huge hitbox paired with low base speed and horrible base stats makes him play on a huge handicap that cannot be even compensated with the rather low output he can do, be it in terms of damage or utility wise.\nThe forced bot lane duo crap should be removed, it is not healthy for league due to the fact that you cannot always get a smart/cooperative team mate and always end up having your lane screwed with the slightest misplays.\nBot lane Morde will never be able to win vs competent adcs who can kite and dodge ccs. I like to play bot lane morde alot due to the fact that there are plenty of bad adcs but is now screwed with adc outstating morde with ms and damage the entire game phase.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ixoziel","date":"2018-03-21T16:13:02.286+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just want the old Morde back.

But as he is prety much guaranteed to recieve a rework any time soon whould you like him to keep (or retake) his botlane viability?","replies":[{"poster":"Risen29","date":"2018-03-22T01:32:31.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Awesomeasf ck,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0WcULk6J,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2018-03-22T01:22:08.915+0000)\n>\n> I got a question for you.

It certainly isn't viable now. \n\nOf course I am happy for him to be viable in any lane. I like flexibility and variety, and uniqueness. \n\nMy problem was that it was stupid for them to design his kit in a way that doesn't allow him to get value out of his abilities unless he is in the adc position. Especially when he's so bad at it. His kit should be tweaked so that you can get more value out of his abilities even if you are in other positions.

He is an AP Fighter, and must be treated as such. The reason he's not an AP tank is because he lacks CC, and doesn't have the best survivability boosters. \n\nYou cannot try to pigeon hole him as a mid. He is more versatile and unique than that. He has a place top, jungle, and bottom. He just needs some tweaking to make it viable. \n\nHe's fun because he has a unique mix of situational survivability and damage, combined with a unique limitation of having to close the distance first. \nI have no problem with him as an AP Fighter who has trouble getting to the target but wrecks it and is hard to kill once he gets there.\n \nThe reason I despise their reworked design of him, is because it makes no sense in other ways.\nThey over designed his kit with the the intention that he would fill the Bottom role. it's fine to have that intention, but not fine if you design his abilities in a way that they don't even properly function without him being in that one very specific role.\n\n1. His W only works if you are the one getting the kills. Meaning you can't effectively use it as support.\n2. His W only fully works in a duo lane.\n3. His W doesn't even work as a self buff of damage for the jungle, only a heal. It shouldn't require someone else to function as an AoE around him. \n4. His ultimate makes no sense with his kit. It has no real synergy. It's like they just wanted to give you a reason to go botlane so you'd want to get that dragon with it. But at least if he could jungle better than his ultimate would have more meaning. \n\nI think with some tweaks to his kit to be more flexible, and none of this forced duo lane crap, he would be a much more viable jungle and top laner. People play him as support too, so that would help them if they do.\n\nIronically, the one role they tried to force him to play, is the one that people are refusing to play. Things are pretty bad when they'd rather play support Kaiser than ADC Kaiser. I personally play jungle Kaiser before I'd ever play ADC Kaiser. \n\nit was a stupid concept from the beginning, melee AP ADC. You don't scale like an ADC because you're AP. Even melee hypercarries like Yasuo and Yi aren't stupid enough to go bot and try to pretend to be a melee ADC, even though they technically have the scaling to output enough damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zëd Lęppelin","date":"2018-03-21T23:18:44.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want him to maintain no CC/mobility tbh. I also want him to have like 200 ms base. I also think he should have pretty decent damage reduction at all times and a solid million damage. A heavy metal guitar solo should play globally everytime he gets a kill (Fade to Black's closing notes play globally when he dies) and players that Mordekaiser is moving towards should hear a subtle Iron Man riff. I just really want an indestructible, slow moving Morde that really just feels _metal_.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A treespook nest","date":"2018-03-21T19:58:28.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I might be one of the few who really wants a redesign on his current kit. I really like how it all flows together outside of his ult.\n\nI agree that Morde has a thematic problem but I think a lot of that can be solved by visual changes to his moves, and better scaling for a typical team fights with power being stripped away from ult and passive during the laning phase to compensate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CoolKnightST","date":"2018-03-21T17:29:18.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> So, Tl;DR Mordekaiser thematic lends itself best for a Battlemage-like gameplay fantasy where he strikes a firm middle ground between a true frontline fighter and an AoE Mage.\n\nI 100% agrea, I have been spamming to riot that Morde is a battlemage for about a year now. I don't get why the insist to push out this juggernaut theme towards him since it doesn't fit him add all.\n\n{{champion:82}} should be reworked into a battlemage. I would like to see him as a variation to {{champion:8}} where he prefers to build {{item:3742}} as defensive option unlike Vlad that rather go for a {{item:3065}}. He should be a champion that builds items like {{item:3146}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3116}} etc..\n\nA change to resourceless with a healthcost could be a better concept for him but rather that sustaining himself I think shielding should be a way better alternative that also scales better with armor. \n\nAs far theme goes, I would rather to see something more with the resurect them. An example idea:\n\n**Morde healthbar is now one shield. When the shield is 0 he transforms into a ghost and takes controle of the enemy that killed him. Morde ghost will act as a pet but until the ghost is killed. You have controle over your killer.**","replies":[]}]}
