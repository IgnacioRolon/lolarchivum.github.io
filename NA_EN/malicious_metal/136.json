For this particular pre-season patch things will also be a little bit more work in progress than usual, since we're going to PBE 3 weeks before the patch rather than the usual 2. That means quite a few things, numbers in particular and in at least a few cases art, won't be finalized yet.\n\nSome examples (there'll be plenty more, this isn't a comprehensive list) of things that are still being worked on a lot:\n\n* We've been getting reports from playtests that Talon's kit may be too weak right now. We're testing further to validate that, possible the stats that go to the PBE today will be too low however.\n* We're playing around with a reduced vision radius on the revised pink wards to assess how that affects detection of both wards/traps and camouflaged champions. That's just gone into testing recently, so it's a more experimental change than most of what's being tested for the patch.\n* Spawn times, length of warning telegraph and locations for plants are still getting iteration.\n* Krugs have a new mechanic on them (the big ones split into smaller Krugs when killed, which give separate XP/Gold). The art for that's not ready yet though, so you'll see some somewhat rough placeholder visual effects for now.\n* Honeyfruit plant doesn't have all of its visual effects ready yet\n* Etc","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2016-10-18T18:06:35.652+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Krugs have a new mechanic on them (the big ones split into smaller Krugs when killed, which give separate XP/Gold).
