It&#039;s extremely satisfying to impale someone and drag them off and it really fits his niche as a Diver: Isolating high priority targets and eliminating them\r\n\r\nTwo; His personality and VO\r\nI ADORE Skarner&#039;s VO, it&#039;s one of the reasons I don&#039;t use Battlecast that often as Skarner&#039;s voice is just one of the best there is.\r\nIt perfectly shows that looks can be deceiving as Skarner isn&#039;t some rabid beast but a gentle creature who has been driven to cause violence due to the cruelty shown to his people.\r\n\r\nHe&#039;s the unsung hero for his kind, he&#039;s the vanguard who has to make the world save enough for the others to awaken and once again walk on Runeterran soil. He&#039;s got the wisdom of his heart stone, eon-old memories provide him with the wisdom of his ancestors and the power of said crystal makes him a force to be reckoned with.\r\nI don&#039;t want him to become some edgy monster guy who ENJOYS violence, he&#039;s a creature that most people will see as a threat when in fact he wouldn&#039;t harm unless given a good reason to do so.\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\n**What I would change**\r\nNow, unto to actual kit changes I would suggest.\r\n\r\n&lt;Make Impale a skillshot&gt;\r\nImpale is a great ultimate but lacks counterplay.\r\nIdeally I&#039;d love it to be a medium ranged skillshot where Skarner lashes out with his Stinger and impales the first target hit, supressing them and dragging them off.\r\nIt would make him rely less on being directly on top of the enemy and having to use flash in order to make the most out of his ultimate.\r\nAnd i&#039;d look totally awesome, especially on battlecast where he actually has a Harpoon!\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;Less Spammy, higher impact basic spells&gt;\r\nYou see this huge crystal scorpion, thinking his claws would be enough to tear you apart...\r\nYet he just spams Q in order to kill you with a million papercuts.\r\n&quot;Limb from limb....&quot;\r\n&quot;I will tear them apart...&quot;\r\n&quot;In claw&#039;s reach...&quot;\r\nSkarner himself makes it sound like his claws would be extremely terrifying to meet up close, yet they&#039;re pretty lackluster in that regar.\r\nThat&#039;s why I suggest making his primary Claw strike be on a higher cd than currently and deal more damage/have additional effects so that it&#039;s gonna be way more satisfying to use.\r\nAlso, I&#039;d advise not keeping the instant AoE aspect of it but make it somewhat of a skillshot strike in front of him as it&#039;d be a bit more avoidable and allow for it to actually be strong.\r\n\r\nSeeing that it&#039;s a VGU I don&#039;t want to go into other aspects of his kit but the Crystal Vanguard has to actually make use of his gigantic crystalline form and actually feel like the image we get from his lore and visuals.\r\n\r\n_________________________________________\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I think Skarner can really benefit from a rework in terms of Gameplay but less so in terms of visuals and lore/voice as we already lost one of our rather somber monster Champions with Galio&#039;s rework.\r\nSkarner himself is NOT a monster, he&#039;s a magnificent creature older than humanity or the rune wars with a gentle mind and immensely powerful crystal frame.\r\n\r\nThe main isse a Skarner VGU should try to tackle is his lack of Satisfying gameplay pattern and how binary his kit is.\r\nHe can be one of the coolest champions if only his gameplay would be more enjoyable as his character is already one of the greatest there is!\r\n\r\nhttp://img11.deviantart.net/5833/i/2013/320/e/6/the_scar_of_war_by_artsed-d6ty2k9.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-06-28T16:33:46.344+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">Now that Skarner's been confirmed to be slated for a VGU\n\nLinks.

I agree with your idea of removing reliability from Impale, as it takes up so much of his power budget.  Spammable  skills however have always been a part of Skarner's identity, ever since his original passive which lowered his abilities cooldowns with auto attacks.  Of course the nature of that design pushed his identity towards that of a juggernaut as he was favored in extended duels, and if Riot wants to move him towards a diver playstlye (which i don't necessarily agree with, but that's a digression), you could make an argument that they should decrease the uptime on his abilities.  However i can think of another way to increase the impact of his abilities, and help deal the 'use it the second its up' issue that you highlighted.  **Make his abilities interdependent** AKA make them interact with each other to some degree.  That reinforces proper timing of his abilities, and allows them to made interesting.  Frankly the fact that they have such low cooldowns, would allow his kit to be combo based (think Ryze).  \n\nOn a side note, i feel like mentioning his power curve.  Skarner has almost always been a late game champ, (some iterations have had a bit more power in the early-mid game then others) and I feel that should remain.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2017-06-28T19:45:03.512+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want him to use his tail more too.

I think the 'constant zone of threat' is actually fairly iconic to his identity, similar to Hecarim's Q or Garen's E. This zone of threat and damage ensures he remains a constant threat in teamfights, similar to other Juggernauts with AoE skills. Skarner's Q was my most cast ability last season (Yay for data!), and I don't think that should change.\n\nI also believe he should be a Juggernaut, not a Diver. In my opinion, as someone who's been playing Skarner since his original kit, and as someone who sports Skarner as their highest mastery champion, being kitable and fast while being durable with high sustained damage falls perfectly within the Juggernaut mold. Divers are characters with dashes or blinks that can jump over walls or through a frontline. A Juggernaut runs through the frontline without a dash(Volibear, Udyr, Garen, etc), or rips through the frontline to get to the fragile enemies(Darius, Mordekaiser(?), etc).\n\nThe other thing I feel is crucial to Skarner is his sticking power. Skarner is someone who, once he's on you, is extremely difficult to peel off. Originally, this was his movement speed+constant slow on Q. Later on, it was stacking movement speed plus slow on E. Currently, it's slow+stun on E plus movement speed from passive. Skarner's damage needs to be limited to close range in order for this identity to persist, because if you're alone, and Skarner is on top of you, he is NOT coming off. His damage, then, is sustained instead of burst, because burst+sticking power would probably be an overpowered combination. This also means, at least in my opinion, his ultimate should remain point-and-click, partially for reliability and partially to limit his damage. A welcome change, though, would be for him to constantly AA the target of his ult while they're suppressed.\n\nSkarner, currently, does more DPS than most Juggernauts. The main problem is his combat sustain and item dependence. His shield doesn't provide him with enough sustain, like Darius' Q heal or Mordekaiser's passive shield, and because he's primarily a jungler, he desperately struggles to keep up with the item builds of enemies.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Predatorator","date":"2017-06-28T18:10:13.054+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i'm really a fan of his ultimate having a little bit more range, like he lunges his tail to someone, drags him to himself, and then has another second or so to trag the enemy around. \n\nEdit: also the Q! what you said about his Q is so alright","replies":[]},{"poster":"khorney","date":"2017-06-29T23:16:20.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he is crap every since they reworked him. they made him weaker in every aspect","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2017-06-29T21:44:32.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ugh... please leave poor Skarner alone.

Perhaps an enchantment for Trinity Force, only available to Crystal-Scar champions, or even his boots, similar to the old Homeguard. Everyone buys tier 2 boots.\n\nAs for map-specific strengths and weaknesses, Skarner can lane as he currently is, without a spire. You just have to play smart, something this Riven-filled community wouldn't understand. Literally just a small numbers buff to his passive, Q, W, or E would make it so that you lot could play him.\n\n**You can't view it as, \"SKARNER REGULAR STRENGTH IS WITH SPIRES, WITHOUT HE WEAK\" You have to see the spires as a buff, that makes him STRONK-er, like when Shyvana gets bonuses from killing drags, or how Trundle is particularly stronger inside his W.**","replies":[]}]}]}]}
