If he&#039;s ahead he&#039;ll be unkillable, is he behind his passive could be called Paper Man\n\n\nBut Iron Man&#039;s only 50% of what Morde is, the other is his ultimate Children of the Grave, which could potentially turn a losing game around by turning it into a 6v4 (A great song by AoD).\n>>Its problems lie in it cloning an entire champion as well as BUFFING it with Morde&#039;s own stats. Like Iron Man its impact is determined by factors other than simple stats, scaling on how strong the affected enemy is and being either one of the best or the worst ultimate abilities depending on the clone you&#039;ll get.\n \n\nThe Tragedy here is that Mordekaiser&#039;s entire Identity&#039;s founded on concepts that cannot be allowed to exist in their current form, being unhealthy designs that are not constant but depend on factors Mordekaiser himself can&#039;t really decide himself.\nHis VGU should aim to retain his Identity but change his kit so that it could be one Riot&#039;s allowed to support and balance in the future.\n\n\n**What is Dead may never die**\nMordekaiser is an undead Revenant who just refuses to stay dead, which ties into his Iron Man passive.\nHe thrives on conquest and suffering, the midst of battle being where he feels alive, the misery of his enemies sustaining him and fueling his onslaught.\n\nMordekaiser&#039;s durability should be tied to him fighting in the enemy lines, being susceptible to being poked and kited but becoming a real monster when he does get in range, his very presence causing agony and death, draining his surroundings of their life as he prolongs his own.\nMordekaiser already excels at surviving otherwise lethal encounters with his arsenal of heavy hitting AoE that funnel his shield and keep him going. \n\nHis VGU should retain the feel of him thriving on all the negative emotions of his enemies and live off the suffering and torment he causes.\nIf it would be up to me to decide on how to implement such a feature I&#039;d still go for a shield but instead of being solely based on damage dealt I&#039;d a percentage of his maximum shield amount to it like his current Siphon of destruction. It would still allow him to invest in damage like a Juggernaut should but also allow him to have a constant influx of shield and not be shut down when behind or the enemy stacking MR.\n\n\n**Your Soul shall serve the dead**\nA few months ago I suggested a new ultimate for Mordekaiser, replacing the single ghost of an enemy with upwards to five Wraiths whose stats were based half on Mordekaiser&#039;s own and the other by a target enemy champion, the ghost spawning instantly instead of requiring the target to die would make his ultimate have an immediate impact while keeping the whole commander of Souls theme but I&#039;m digressing.\n\nMordekaiser&#039;s lore paints him as a being capable of not only sustaining himself through necromancy but also wielding it in a very proficient way, being able to bind Liches to his will as well as raising the dead to do his bidding.\nMordekaiser needs this to be present in his kit in some way or the other, him holding dominion over the very fabric of life and death to twist souls to serve him in eternity.\nNo matter how strong you were in life, your soul will serve the dead, and you&#039;ll be forced to witness the destruction of all you hold dear.\nThis is the horror of Mordekaiser&#039;s curse and should really be kept in his design.\n\n\n**Warlock or Warlord? Both!**\nThis point will be rather brief but Mordekaiser NEEDS to be a Hybrid, tapping into both AD and AP.\nHis lore paints him to not only be able to crush his foes with his sheer strength but also having unfathomable sorcery to utilize in his enemies&#039; destruction.\nHe&#039;s a warlord Mage who empowers his already impressive battle prowess with magic, having a wide arsenal of ways to destroy you.\nIt makes his itemization very versatile since he&#039;d still build mostly tank but can utilize a wide array of offensive items.\n\n**Metal**\nWe&#039;ve had this discussion before on the Story and Art boards but Metal is something many people attribute to Mordekaiser and it should be kept in his design, yet not be the sole theme.\nIt would make him nothing more than a parody of the Metal genre if you were to make him use metal just for the hell of it but it could and should be kept in some way.\nHim being a Wraith encased in metal armor is a great starting point, seeing that he empowers his weaponry with deathly energies, turning the already lethal metal into unholy objects of destruction-\nAnd let&#039;s be honest, seeing a massive behemoth in metal armor surrounded by a storm of metal shrapnel infused with necromantic energies is pretty darn badass-\n\n**So to summarize a bit:**\n-Juggernaut\n-Hybrid\n-Damage and Durability\n-Soul stealing\n-Battle-bound tankiness\n\n\nI think I&#039;ve covered most of the things I believe are crucial to rework Mordekaiser while improving on his design and keeping everything that makes Mordekaiser Morde intact and building on that fantasy of the Dark Lord/Deathknight Archetype.\n\nhttp://66.media.tumblr.com/6e4ab0ea710236a75cb9495bf5f57eac/tumblr_o3ofom6BuJ1ucq9cfo1_500.png","replies":[{"poster":"ltmetal","date":"2016-06-07T18:57:52.264+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":2,"body":"Mordekaiser mains' wishlist for his VGU:\n\n1.

In regards to creating a situation that favors him, the usual method of accomplishing this is creating some form of mobility or crowd control, which allows a champion to create a favorable situation.\n\nOur dream Mordekaiser is a champion who can function without a means of crowd control or mobility, which means we need to find other methods of creating moments of power for Mordekaiser against enemies.\n\nTo that end, we need to prove that champions can exist without some form of crowd control or mobility and still be viable.\n\nPerhaps instead, Mordekaiser can act in spite of crowd control and mobility?\n\nTenacity has always been discussed on Mordekaiser, and it seems fitting that someone with arguably one of if not the most powerful will in this universe (you can make an argument that once anything has crossed the Threshhook of death {lel} while cursed, Mordekaiser can take its soul and dominate it), would be able to simply resist the disruptive effects of crowd control to a degree. Whether this could be something he just naturally has within his kit, or which he has to work for to obtain or maintain is up for debate.\n\nThe answer to mobility is range, the ability to act in a distance long enough that any sort of mobility effect that isn't extreme (Leblanc or Kassassin for example) is rendered moot.\n\nThe question is how to implement such methods of play without compromising Mordekaiser's identity.\n\nI think the implementation of those ethereal servants that Mordekaiser is purported to command would be the answer.\n\nI think an answer to how to make Children of the Grave function without having to rely solely on a champion kill is give it a different effect when cast without a champion in mind to target. If Mordekaiser were to cast his ultimate without targeting an enemy champion, he could summon a number of spirits to his side and command them to seek out enemy champions and drain life and might from them.\n\nSaid ghosts could then function like FQC and seek out enemy champions to attach to and drain of might and magic, maybe stealing health like the traditional ultimate curse (but adjusted for having multiple ghosts out there, all potentially able to chase and affect targets) and/or attack damage and/or ability power. Yes, you have a sort of multiple-ghost curse potential but you wouldn't benefit from the full power of the curse and gain an undead servant since Mordekaiser is spreading himself thin to affect all his opposition... or perhaps Mordekaiser COULD take the soul of an enemy killed while cursed by one of these ghosts, but perhaps Mordekaiser must go over and collect the soul himself (which could be dangerous in the middle of a teamfight, especially is this were made into a channel), and maybe said spirit has already been weakened by the ghost attached to them, and thus they return in a weakened state.\n\nIt would tie in with his whole theme of commanding spirits for himself, a true warlord of battle and undeath.\n\nIn regards to tenacity, I think a combination of passive and active tenacity would be perfect for himself, with him having some manner of crowd control resistance innately just for being who he is, and creating moments where he can act in spite of anything the enemy has to throw at him, damage-wise or cc-wise.\n\nPerhaps like his damage shield, Mordekaiser could obtain some form of shield that weakens and potentially nullifies a single instance of crowd control against him, not really sure how this would work in my opinion, so it's just me trying to throw ideas to see what sticks more than anything else.\n\nMordekaiser's Q is unique and cool and the third hit always feels satisfying to us, but I do miss having the potential to hit multiple targets like the old Q. Perhaps the third hit could have an aoe put into it, like an electric backlash of kinetic and ethereal force from the impact being that powerful, and give us a bit of that nostalgia back.\n\nHis Siphon is as satisfying to use as always, I just have trouble explaining how your Attack Damage increases your ability to literally wreak necromantic destruction (at least if it had the metal maces popping out like before, it would make sense... sorta), but then again this is league of legends, there are a few inconsistencies here and there like that, and it's just a personal pet peeve of mine.\n\nHarvester of Sorrow is a mess in my personal opinion, it's cool in theory but the hidden power of the experience boost is just something that thematically still doesn't make sense (does he use the memories of slain foes to improve his own combat expertise?) and has yet to be answered. The dependency on having an ally to utilize your aoe damage thematically makes Mordekaiser seem weak, unable to get anything done without a lackey at his side, having said lackey should just be a bonus.\n\nOn the subject of Harvester of Sorrow and allies, I feel that without the metal theme of magnetism to explain how he and his ally move faster moving towards each other (does he have invisible spirits who he commands to speed things up? In which case why doesn't he just do this all the time?) is confusing as a whole. If Mordekaiser is to be someone who commands the battlefield and brings some form of utility to the team, it should be something that seems fitting for himself, and something that can be explained.\n\nI think a method of this that would thematically make sense would be to implement a Bond of Stone-like effect between Mordekaiser and his Harvesting ally, allowing Mordekaiser to direct a portion of incoming damage towards whoever has higher current health. Fitting his theme of the sharing of pain with others, he can share his own pain with his allies to lessen an unnecessary burden on himself, or take more of a burden upon himself so that someone more vulnerable than himself but still useful is able to survive a difficult situation.","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2016-06-07T21:18:35.126+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"This, I like this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tengrichan","date":"2016-06-08T13:40:13.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the only things that should be reserved in his kit is the old Q with prolly some new mechanic tied to it and/or his passive.His current kit is just bad.Sorry CertainlyT.\nUlti needs to change.Perhaps he could summon a big ghost hand from the otherverse to emerge from the ground and grab enemies in an area.\nGrabbed units take greatly increased damage from Mordekaiser or the hand just deals more damage the more enemies it grabs.\nIdea is make the new ulti reliable with a self buff or damage amplification tied into it or CC.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Boltrix","date":"2016-06-08T14:18:54.568+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would hope my friend that you are joking on that ultimate ability.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ltmetal","date":"2016-06-07T21:14:40.054+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would love to see Tenacity or CC cleansing on Morde, but only if it's very obvious to himself and his opponents that the tenacity is activated.

Thus dealing damage to enemies strips away their spirit energy--which he converts into a metallic shield for himself. The stronger the soul, the more durable the metal created of it.\n\nHis mace, Nightfall, could have been created from the soul of a reknown hero or epic monster. Perhaps an old figurehead for one of the major nations of Runeterra or even the Ruined King himself (don't exactly know who it is--or if it is undead).\n\nHis armor could be what his soul manifested as upon becoming undead--along with his powers over soul-metal manipulation and conversion abilities. His armor is what his actual health is while the soul-metal armor covering it is what his passive is. He probably only uses the most powerful souls to repair his actual \"body\", which would make sense in his R--where he uses his powers over manipulating souls themselves to forcefully rip the soul of a worthy adversary (a champion) to convert into his \"body\".\n\nAs for the \"magnetic\" speed boost gained from W could be better defined as the souls surrounding himself and the target being drawn to one another--boosting their movement speed towards each other. The damage component is the souls converting into metal to grind against his living enemies.\n\nHis E is him sending souls through the earth in a cone--converting them into metal when they lash up at his enemies.\n\nHope you like this concept :)  You're an inspiration to all us board dwellers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mazariamonti","date":"2016-06-07T22:10:46.358+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just want his feet to be smaller","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wukong X Ahri","date":"2016-06-07T19:47:23.932+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://gif-finder.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Daniel-Bryan-YES-YES-YES.gif\n\nHit the nail on the head.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2016-06-08T02:30:08.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as he isn't awful to play against in lane like he is now, I'll take whatever you got MM.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wild Geese","date":"2016-06-08T20:23:27.669+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just don't like where he is right now.
