However small, if he ever has to put his hands near his hips or thighs, or even put his legs together, he's going to hurt himself. Big no-no.\n\nSecond could be classified as me being nit-picky, but that's not a good spot for Morde to be holding his mace. Maces need to rely entirely on the force of the owner's swing to do damage, and because of how long the hilt is, a fair amount of the weight is put behind Mordes grasp. This forces his swings to lose power, simply because the weight isn't distributed toward the hitting end. If it was a staff or he was two-handing it, it'd be fine, but neither are the case.\n\nI hope you don't take this the wrong way. It's all unwarranted criticism, and undeserved, but I only say this so your design's in the future can improve. :D","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-08-29T02:40:55.553+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"1: he is a suit of armor. There is essentially 0 chance of him hurting himself on those tiny spikes, and he may not even feel actual pain.\n\n2: he is just holding it for dramatic effect. It is obviously designed as a two-handed mace (even though I'm sure he could easily use it in one hand). If he was swinging it, or in a more combat-ready stance, I'm sure he'd be holding it more properly. It's not like a sword where there're pretty much only one way to casually hold it.","replies":[{"poster":"Jacknife","date":"2016-08-29T08:13:17.632+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Close, he's a suit of armor that USED to go on a human body, if his lore has anything to say about it. Wraith Mordekaiser may not feel pain, but human Mordekaiser did, albeit barely. You have to take the character's backstory into account when making versions of the character, otherwise you'll miss the mark. Even if it's extremely minor, full-body armor that could potentially harm the wearer is just bad design.\n\nAs for the rest say what you will, I did say it was me being nit-picky. He does look like he's making an action pose, so he's probably just trying to be intimidating.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Doctor Dyment","date":"2016-08-29T07:09:38.161+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think he needs to look a bit... heavier. The chest plate looks good and the shoulders are nice, but I wish the abdomen and stomach area was a bit wider.

Yes, they'd probably get in the way but they do give him a more spiky shilouette, might need to revise the design a tad.\n\n2. I agree, yet this is deliberately so for three reasons:\nFirstly it allows me to draw him without the mace obscuring any part of his armor. He'd still be resting the hunk of metal on his shoulder\n\nSecondly; it's more of an action pose to make him seem more intimidating/give him a somewhat broader stance\n\nLastly but not least; I totally forgot to put more detail into the mace, he'd be grasping it at the bottom and not the middle; artistic fail on my part^^'","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Whyte Lyon","date":"2016-08-29T08:52:56.838+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rito, I would literally give you all my money if you name the next Morde skin after OP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"crippler38","date":"2016-08-29T04:00:49.600+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"neato so rito take a seato and update numero uno.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fat Bastard GOD","date":"2016-08-29T11:15:12.132+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Power Of Syndra","date":"2016-08-31T13:11:20.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good job! :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azteryz","date":"2016-08-29T22:38:21.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like it \n\nbut i have this weird idea where he looks like an average dark knight but the more his shield bar increases the more armor pieces that start to form on him\n\nso at 0 shielding take for example it looks like your sketch \n\nbut at 100% shield he gets more armor piece layers and looks even bulkier \n\nhttp://orig13.deviantart.net/d326/f/2015/204/8/6/mordekaiser_by_hoasind-d92i0xb.jpg\n\nlike maybe it turns into this^^\n\nthis could also be epic for his future skins making each new one always worth","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThePartyLeader","date":"2016-08-29T21:25:46.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Metal!","replies":[]},{"poster":"LilStacey87","date":"2016-08-29T20:49:32.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great artwork!
