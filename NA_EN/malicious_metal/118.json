Different hardness standards would end up having pretty different evaluations of a material's hardness. Toughness, on the other hand, is simply a measure of the energy absorbed to fracture per unit volume. Diamond, lacking a plastic deformation phase, has very low toughness, it cannot absorb a lot of energy before it fractures. However, its high Young's Modulus means that the **static force** required to fracture is very high.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"HighH1","date":"2016-06-20T17:53:21.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's what it says in the post and the fact that tidal was talking about Masters which seems to be made of metal","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Habitz","date":"2016-06-20T15:32:04.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-06-20T11:42:35.566+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:44}} The gems beckon you.
