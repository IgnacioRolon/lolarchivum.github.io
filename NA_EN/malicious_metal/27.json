Yet I personally feel a very interesting plot point could be linking her to the Shadow Isles via a champion we all known, love or hate; {{champion:82}} \nNow before you get the pitchforks and call me biased her me out.\n\nMordekaiser&#039;s downfall was only able due to some mysterious THIEF infiltrating his HEAVILY GUARDED Bastion and retrieving his skull, making resurrecting him impossible.\nThis shadowy figure could have very well been Evelynn.\nNow, we all know Mordekaiser&#039;s a very proficient warlock able to weave spells and curses.\nWhat IF in the wake of his defeat he CURSED whoever had caused his downfall to an eternity of shadows, corrupting them to walk both the realm of shadows and death and the one of the living?\nThis would lead her back into the Mist to feed upon the necromantic energies and use its veil to further increase her already potent abilities.\nJust some weird brainstorming, I&#039;d like your own opinions on the matter.\nhttp://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/2/29/Shadow_Isles_Crest.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150410071357\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------- **Their Pain is My Pleasure** --------------------------------------------------------\nA very prominent trend in Evelynn&#039;s design is that she DELIGHTS in inflicting pain and misery unto her victims.\nJust a quick look at her abilities makes this crystal clear.\nBut what&#039;s an even bigger pointer is her extravagant appearance.\nhttps://66.media.tumblr.com/17301053fec475dabdc4a2a36054ae30/tumblr_o5lcczYfyw1tvo2c3o1_500.gif\n-Revealing clothing\n-Red, blue and blackish hues\n-Spikes and studs\n-Claws\n-Bizzare cape\n-High heels\n\nIn short something a dominatrix would wear.\nNow, we all know these people who just jump on the White Knighting bandwagon and complain about characters being sexualized.\nSorry to break it to them but Evelynn&#039;s SUPPOSED to be sexualized in some way. She&#039;s the WIDOWMAKER.\n\nThis is one of her core themes and should be kept in her reworked design at all cost, she&#039;s sadistic, she has FUN tormenting innocent souls, she&#039;s very much like the depiction of vampires as these predators who lure you in by their charms and sex appeal (before Twilight ruined it all, ffs...)\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------- **Shadows beckon**-------------------------------------------------------------------\nBut something that&#039;s even more essential to Evelynn&#039;s character is her affliction to Shadows and the night, being able to use them to her advantage and melt into the darkness, becoming just another shade in the night.\nNow this is more than just Zeddie&#039;s shadow clones, this is the tool of a stealthy femme fatale who will come for you, drain you of your life and disappear into the night like nothing ever happened.\n\nHer stealthy nature is what makes Eve what she is, being swift on her heels and sticking to the shadows, like a veil shielding her from unwanted gazes.\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------- **Gameplay** -------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is a real problem and has always been a balance nightmare.\nEvelynn&#039;s kit is inherently unhealthy due to her being able to flank without the enemy noticing it, making her bypass wards easily and making her a nightmare to play against because you may never know when you&#039;re going to feel her claws on your back.\nIt&#039;s something that has always caused her to be nerfed into the ground and it has come so far that her identity as an assassin has been warped into simply a flanking skirmisher.\n\nNow, Evelynn SHOULD be an Assassin, slipping in and out of the shadows to anhiliate her prey and leave without a trace.\nThis is Rengar&#039;s shtick and we all know it&#039;s really depressing to play a squishy against these types of champions.\nThe main challenge with her rework will be to give her a healthy assassination pattern and make her stealth a lot more dynamic, to make Evelynn players have to work out a strategy to succeed in their tast, to offer outplay potential beyond buying pinks, to make her more rewarding to play and OUTplay.\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------- **Conclusion **-------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn the end we can all agree that Evelynn&#039;s got a TON of potential as a character, her theme of a masochistic Shadowwalker being one that would appeal to a lot of people if her Kit allowed her to reflect that fantasy.\nHer lacking ANY solid Background offers a lot of freedom if it comes to pushing her core concept to the limit and truly delivering on her fantasy, making her the Widowmaker we&#039;d never want to meet in a dark alley (Well, some of us would :^) )\n\nThere are a precious few things Riot HAS to incorporate in her VGU though, things that are iconic to the character and make her truly unique and give her just this appeal no other champion has to offer.\nDon&#039;t make her another angry wraith like Kalista or flashy ninja like Zed, deliver on a coherent and unique fantasy that taps into her already existing themes.\nThen I&#039;m certain her impending VGU would be one of the best we&#039;ll ever have, except maybe Mordekaiser&#039;s.","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2016-08-26T17:37:14.920+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":0,"body":"We all know why you are so interested in Eve\nhttp://i.imgur.com/CPFakg7.gif?Noredirect\n\nBut seriously, she is one of my favorite champions to use.

I think LOL needs one champ like that and right now it's eve.  So if you make her an assassin, we won't have any champs like that really.  I also have 0 faith in the champ team to remake anything new like that because they aren't making champs anymore (their pace is terrible) and a flexible champ isn't the sort of thing they do anymore.\n\nThen there's also how she deals damage.  Assassins are very bursty champs.  Evelynn has an option for burst with the right build, but she's also a sustained damage champ.  That's not an assassin and being a pure assassin isn't evelynn.  I mean it's perfectly fine with her (maybe not optimal) to go rylai's, ludens, and lyandry's and dance around your foe.  Or you can get something like a lichbane and proc a lot of sheen spikes.  Or you can get BORK on her (not as popular anymore) and mix it with the AS boost from your E to do a lot of sustained damage very fast.  \n\nThen there's the issue of getting to your target.  Assassins have either mobility or in-combat invisibility.  Evelynn doesn't really have any gap closers and her invisibility is out of combat only... she's basically Invisible Boy from Mystery Men.  For her getting to a primary target is less about making a play and more about either using your ult to get tanky enough to reach the squishy or methodically maneuvering yourself into the proper position to make a play.\n\nThen there's the psychology of playing champs.  Assassins are very proactive and quickly punish mistakes.  They tend to be flashy as well.  Evelynn is a champ who works in a more reactive and determined fashion.  She's the methodical one.  She's not the flashy outplay/burst champ.  \n\nFinally look at her ult.  It has zero kill potential and it makes her tanky.  That is not an assassin's ult.  \n\nEvelynn has never been an assassin nor should she be.  If anything, as our resident BDSM champ, she should probably be more about control and domination than the flashy killer.  She should also be tough enough to take pain as well as dish it out.\n\n\nPS.  PLEASE DO NOT MAKE HER A SHADOW ISLES CHAMP.  Or a vampire.  Or a succubus.  I really like the fact that Evelynn is a mysterious champ.  Please keep her like that.  Let each player fill in the blank for himself.  I mean when you look at her gameplay variety, I think keeping her a Rorschach champion thematically (and gameplay wise) is the better option for this one case.","replies":[{"poster":"Dessem","date":"2016-08-26T22:01:28.431+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"> Evelynn is a champ who works in a more reactive and determined fashion.

You skirt around the edges of the enemy team, waiting for the fight to break out and a small window of time opens... just enough for you to run at 'em, kill 'em and then get out while the rest of their team is distracted by *your* team. \n\nEvelynn's the assassin who sits there waiting for the right opportunity to make her move, rather than the assassins who force an opportunity or make a play.\n\nI also love how one game you can build an Evelynn specialised around bursting down one squishy champ (i.e. E is physical damage, build Youmuu/Draktharr for ridiculous one-hit burst against squishies) and then the next you take a supportive role (Rylai, Liandries, kite and soft CC), and then the next game again you're suddenly tank-initiator Evelynn. \n\nYou're not locked into a pattern of \"burst down a squishy\"; you're actually capable of opting into initiation, peeler, DPS, physical burst, magical burst, on-hit Evelynn, split-push Evelynn, gottagofast Evelynn, etc. The only thing I wouldn't recommend on Evelynn is Support Evelynn.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SlawthFul13","date":"2016-08-26T22:17:18.053+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to agree.

Because she doesn't fit into one nice neat package, there's a lot of dispute over what she's 'really' supposed to be.  As with the first Eve remake I want to reiterate my warning here.  Focusing too much on burst damage with Eve's VGU will almost without question lead to her getting nerfed until she's a Skirmisher/Diver again.\n\nIf you guys want to drop the Diver durability and go with Skirmisher style sustained damage paired with Assassin style target selection and focus-break I can see that potentially working.

It's just that Evelynn's both been high on the VGU list since last year at the least (from what I gather), but also hard to decide exactly how to move forward with because her coherence is so... awkward. With the VGU being unlikely for 2017, it'd mean 2018 at the earliest for Evelynn to get her VGU sometime during that year.\n\nThat means from 2014 to 2018, Evelynn's unlikely to see any new skins. The current skin selection is... well, limited in scope; they don't provide new particles, SFX or animations, and neither of the two different outfits provides a more assassin-like fantasy. In fact, both rather detract from that fantasy, in my opinion, since it's a tango dancer and a safecracker. (Could make some case for an assassin dressed as a tango dancer, but this is a vampire that strikes from stealth; I don't think disguises are her thing.)\n\nSo while I am aware that generally it's avoided because of a planned VGU, there'll be an awful lot of time between Evelynn skins and it'd be nice if there were some skin we could get in the mean time to quiet the hankering to throw money at the screen in an expression of love for Evelynn.\n\nSome chromas'd be cool, too.

She goes in, combos, and then runs away before you can retaliate heavily. She has a speed boost which makes slows not very useful, so she's allowed to literally dance around you (twice I've faced Eve's that just circle around me and kill me with continuous spikes and claws. She pretty much counters Sion IMO).\n\nShe's both mischievous and malicious: a playful sadist if you will. Toying with her prey until they realize to late that they can't win, leaving a expression of despair painted on their face that will be forever remembered in her most enjoyable dreams.\n\nThis is just how I think she is meant to be portrayed and how I feel whenever she kits me to death. But gameplay wise she is weird and it's probably because of how difficult it is to balance stealth (from it being near useless in pro to being broken in bronze. I imagine Riot would want stealth to be more healthy but still respectively used in high Elo). She builds tanky because she needs to get in the middle of the fight to do the most damage, whereas her passive gives the impression of a stalker who kills lone targets.\"\n\nEffectively I believe that her sadistic stalker pattern is what makes Eve, Eve. She goes out, takes a bit of you, leaves and repeats until she takes the final blow. A sadomasochistic game of cat and mouse (wether this is healthy is to be determined). \n\nShe's not meant to be a frontliner. No one that hides in the shadows should be able to take a beating like a front line warrior. \n\nNow the curse story I like, especially if it means she started out noble but became corrupted over time. It actually makes me imagine the guys who destroyed Mordekaiser as an adventuring party that built an army. Close friends who fell apart after Mordekaiser's fall. Their greatest defeat a result of their greatest victory. \n\nA tragedy worthy of Mordekaiser's lineage.","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2016-08-26T17:03:05.648+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ralanr,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6uRAp9eo,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2016-08-26T16:59:02.832+0000)\n\n> She&#x27;s both mischievous and malicious: a playful sadist if you will.
