I don't want to hear these quotes in-game, ever. \n\nThis problem, I shit you not, is THE reason I only played riven less than a handful of times in the past. \"My spirit is not lost.\" Stfu you're on a battlefield talk about killing people. \n\nThis is also why I adore Kled, even though he's not released yet.

I know it sounds something similar to garen but to get that health back you actually have to put yourself in harms way to heal back up, it would make his passive more of a choice thing where you either: 1) Use that Shield to Block some incoming damage or  2) Let the shield Decay and regain some of the HP you have lost. Being a slow immobile Harbinger of Death is not an issue to most morde players, There are items that allow us to have immense catch potential (Thanks {{item:3116}} {{item:1402}} {{item:3146}} {{item:3285}} ).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Myst Desdemona","date":"2016-07-31T17:00:07.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always thought that it would be cool if morderkaiser can just inhabit his slaves, whether when he chooses to or when he dies. Perhaps get access to all their tools except their ultimates (Kinda like abathur in HOTS); anything to differentiate it from Yorick. Then again, Yorick is going to get reworked so we don't know what's in store for that one.\nWould definitely make for interesting plays. That and their souls would literally be his.\nBy extention, that could maybe apply to dragon.\n\nI only played Morde like a 100 games so my opinion doesn't hold much water, but it's still fun to play him.\nOne thing is for sure. His passive needs to stay. It's my favorite thing about him.

And it fell on its face, grossly overpowered, nerfed to hell, and fallen flat on its face because of poor commitment to the vision invested.  Same as Kog'maw.  changes were constantly happening, exciting balancing changes trying to get him in a perfect spot.  Now he contributes equal if not less than the other adc's, in terms of dmg, along with zero mobility in order to be able to apply it.  I feel Kog needed an almost juggernaut approach to balancing.  He's not necessarily an ADC, he's an immobile turret that can move around in between team fights haha.  Increase his dmg out put, and increase his vulnerability so there can be real and true \"PROTECT THE KOG\" team builds.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Keìron","date":"2016-07-31T11:25:06.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Malicious Metal i imagine you elaborated a rework concept for the iron revenant.
