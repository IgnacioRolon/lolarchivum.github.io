It is going to be mind blowing but you picking a terrible champion and ruining the game for 4 other people because you wanted to try out a new terrible champion should matter. \n\nPersonally I wouldnt ban a Shaco jungle, but that is just me. If you want to play Malazahar jungle go to a bot game. I completely love the fact that teams now have a slight ability to just remove the idiot factor from games.
