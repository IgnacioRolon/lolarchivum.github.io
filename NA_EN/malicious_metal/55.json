This prettymuch removes toplane as a risiko factor, allowing your jungler to focus purely on bot/mid, and if your carry gets a lead you have as good as won, same with a snowballing assasins.\nThey also offer rather strong tp ganks to help getting your carrie ahead, and if you have a damage focused jungler like nida or lee, a champ like naut can give them free kills vs more squishy laners post 6.\n\nSo righ offer alot benefits, they suplement the usually rather damage focused low cc teamcomps, **they are save**, they have strong synergie with agressive junglers, and they either have great peeling or engage, or both.\n\nThat beeing said, i do think naut is a bit overtuned. He offers relible engage, catchpotential, peeling, solid damage, waveclear, good early trades and good tankiness(as far as tankiness goes, which still means a 5+ item adc kills him in a matter of seconds)\ni think they should shift some damage from his E back to the W, which would help his jungle clear whil it hits the waveclear and harras/short trades in lane and his reliable aoe damage in teamfights, while keeping good potential damage if he's alowed to AA duering W.\n\nalso with the rather stupid metagolem rising, they have an easy life in lane.
