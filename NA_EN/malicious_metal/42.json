The reason why Mage players get annoyed when ad champs become prevalent AT ALL in mid lane is almost entirely because of itemization, more so than the mage's or ad champs themselves. \n\nBecause ad champs don't have to worry about running out of mana as much they can build basically whatever need to to deal with the situation at hand. Things going well? Build some armor pen. Things not going well? Build a maw. Getting poked a little? Build some life steal. Not being significantly gated by mana allows these champions to instantly adapt or take advantage. \n\nWhen I'm playing my mages mid lane it basically goes like this. \n\nAm I worried about getting bursted down? If so work towards a rod of ages. No matter how good or bad things get I must build catalyst first. \nAm I not worried about getting bursted down? If so work towards morellonomicon. No matter how good or bad things get I must build {{item:3802}} first. \n\nIf I don't I am relying entirely on the ability of my team to deliver a blue buff to me. As so, not very reliable. \n\nThe long and the short of it is that mages don't have a good, standard item to answer an AD mid, which makes playing against them feel much worse than it should. Zhonyas is a piece of garbage, it is picked all the time because  mages have no other options, but it's still a shitty item. Mages need an ap armor item that gives them a pool of mana. It doesn't even have to offer a lot of armor, just enough to avoid taking true damage the second your ad opponent builds some armor pen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LadyRenly","date":"2017-10-02T17:14:37.836+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am a diehard mage player, but the boards weekly new circlejerk irritates the heck out of me.

They are almost necessities to a team comp, thats why they are still played. Everyone is getting carried by botlane, so win rate on a mage isnt about its actual capacities as a mage, but how he can support the botlane (the only thing that can stop botlane are full man ganks, explaining the good situation of TF). So everyone is complaining about mages that are not feeling like mages anymore, its not all about numbers... The mid position was considered before to be the \"leader\" kind of role, with it's role being supporting both top and bot while and carrying until the ADC outscales you.
