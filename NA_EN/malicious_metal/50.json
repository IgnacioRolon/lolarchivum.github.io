I like the changes to his abilities, but do you feel like they're forcing Vlad down a more tanky path with only ~2 AP items or something, or is that just my complete inability to tell how to build a champion based upon their abilities?","replies":[{"poster":"Over Innsmouth","date":"2016-04-22T01:25:24.357+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"By all means, don't hesitate to ask! Ooh boy. I do love me some Vlad.\n\nWall of text inc, I'll address each thing you said with at least a paragraph.\n\nFirst things first, I adore the rework. These are almost the exact types of changes I wanted; particularly making E interesting and updating R a bit whilst keeping P, Q, and W intact. The new E looks absolutely amazing; both from an aesthetic view and a gameplay view - since it now provides something that Vlad's enemies has always lacked; being in range whilst having counterplay, since you can hide being minions/tanks/filthy Fizz players now. \nWhat I liked about the ult was the damage amp (since I believe damage amps should be a Noxian thematic the way %health true damage seems to be a Demacian thematic), but it was boring to use and didnt really enforce decision making since the answer to \"how should I use ult\" is always \"just use it\". Now - with the heal-on-pop - you're incentivized to ult as many people as possible for maximum healing.\n\nIt's all just super swell. It helps that E looks fucking awesome when you use it, even on non-BL/SS skins.\n\nRegarding the changes to P, Q, and W, I think they're ok. I've always personally liked building tank-Vlad (DMP/SV/Liandrys) over full AP Vlad, since the point of Vlad isnt to burst your foes faces off ({{champion:45}} ) but to outsustain them the way a juggernaut like {{champion:122}} does, by spamming low-cd heals. Passive does promote health over raw AP now, which I'll talk about more in detail below. The Q changes I feel are a necessary nerfing, especially with that third Q. One major thing jumped out at me when I first thought about it; {{champion:202}} . If Vlad players are smart, they'll treat the Crimson Rush (god what a good name) the way Jhin players treat their fourth shots. Zoning/Harass tools against their enemy laner. The power Crimson Rush offers is worth the loss in standard Transfusion in my mind entirely worth it. \nThe only W change is that you can detonate/cast Tides of Blood whilst in pool, at the cost of solidifying you early - and this is one of my favourite changes, hands down. It adds a sense of dynamic ability to Vlad's kit, rather than Live Vlad who just uses spells as they come off cooldown. \"Do I use E for damage but lose pool, or stay pooled?\" Furthermore, it adds an previously unknown level of outplay to Vlad's kit. Now you can properly destroy some low-health fool who doesnt respect the threat that is the red puddle of death.\n\nNow, onto the passive changes and tankier builds. Yes, I do feel they're shifting him towards a tankier build than he currently employs (due to passive ratio changes and 10% health scaling on Tides of Blood), though not to the extent that you'd only get two AP items. I think absolute core are {{item:3116}} for the stats and slows, {{item:3089}} for the scaling interaction with Crimson Pact, and {{item:3065}} for the CDR, healing, MR and HP. Every Vlad worth their salt will build these three items, IMO. The three stats Vlad misses out on from these items that he needs is Mpen, Armour, and CDR. Since his Q and E CD's are ever so slightly higher at the cost of the abilities themselves being worth more bang, I think maximizing full CDR is less important now - though you still want to get it where you can. Zhonyas can offer armour, but with the way ADC's are right now you'd want the armour _and health_ from {{item:3143}} for the anti-crit or {{item:3742}} for being speedy, over the armour, AP and CDR that {{item:3157}} provides. Then you need boots (I'd opt for {{item:3158}} , but {{item:3111}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3009}} {{item:3020}} are all fine choices). Then for your Mpen choice you have {{item:3151}} which grants additional health but less Mpen, or {{item:3135}} , which offers no health but stronger Mpen. Abysall is also a choice against AP heavy teams, especially since it provides CDR now.\n\nI saw an image from the PBE that had a Vlad with the following items: {{item:3143}} {{item:3158}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3285}} . With this build fully charged E's were putting out roughly 1000 magic damage per cast, due to the health scaling and the AP scaling of the ability.\n\nI'm imagining I'd follow a similar build path, but swap out Ludens and Randuins for Void Staff and Deadmans Plate respectively in an ideal scenario.\n\nOn Zhonyas specifically, the only part of it that Vlad really wants IMO is the CDR. The unique passive was nerfed and provides a lesser version of his W, the AP part was nerfed which means it has less synergy with his passive, and there are better armour items. In my view, what you potentially lose from taking Hourglass is not worth the item slot that could've gone to an AR/HP item.\n\nOn Hextech Rocket Belt (or whatever it's call now), the raw stats look appealing (10% CDR, 300 Health, 80 AP) and the dash is nice, but IMO the item isnt worth missing out on what I've detailed above. Vlad is a truer juggermage than he has been before, and one of the defining traits of the Juggernauts is supposed to be \"un-1v1able\" to the majority of Champions that arent {{champion:11}} . As Vladimir, you have no business running away with with the dash, you stand and sustain and laugh as your health remains neutral and theirs goes down. When they run, beyond \"uncatchables\" like Yi, Udyr, Kassadin, or LeBitch, no one should be escaping you between your E slow, your Crimson Rush haste and your Rylai's slows, ditto for running away. Ever tried to chase an Ezreal who keeps proccing IBG? It's like that with Vlad's low CD's and Rylai's.\nTl;Dr - Rocket Belt is an item for those who need the dash to engage and burst, or to escape. Vlad doesnt care for either of those as much as he cares for what other items can offer.\n\n**Key Points**\n\n* CDR is no longer the be-all end-all stat on Vlad; Health, AP and anything that makes you tankier/maximizes your passive is core.\n* Your scalings are tankier, build tankier. Think of him as not dissimilar from an AP-scaling Darius.\n* Standard Q is weaker, treat Crimson Rush like Jhin's 4th auto.\n* I'm proposing 3 AP items (Rylai's, Rabs, and Mpen) 2 defensive items (AR, Spirit Visage) and boots for the build.\n\nIf there's anything else you want to ask me about or if you're unsure about anything above, don't hesitate to ask!","replies":[{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2016-04-22T03:50:14.754+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since Vlad doesn't utilize AAs as much as traditional tanks, what would you think of replacing Deadman's with Sunfire?","replies":[{"poster":"SH Azykan","date":"2016-04-22T08:06:44.369+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the whole point of deadmans on Vlad is you don't auto.
