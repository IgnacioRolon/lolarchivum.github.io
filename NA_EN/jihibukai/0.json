We sit and spend 10+ minutes starting a ranked game and getting in game. Putting ourselves in the mindset for ranked. Then the enemy team remakes and neither team gets anything for the waste of their time. I understand that the \"losing\" team gets nothing because they technically don't get a loss so they don't lose LP. But the \"winning\" team should get like 2 LP for the waste of their time. They weren't the ones who remade. A remake is technically taking a win away from them. At least give them 2 LP for the waste of their time. It isn't fair to them to have a winning game remade and then get absolutely nothing for it.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-26T01:23:36.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Y'know, I don't personally think this would be a terrible idea, but I could also see some people abusing it as well.

Either intentional or not, they did leave a ranked game and should have some sort of punishment. But I do agree with you that it could be abused, that's why I suggest a low amount like 2. That way its not worth it to remake intentionally since normally you would get around 15+","replies":[]}]}]}
