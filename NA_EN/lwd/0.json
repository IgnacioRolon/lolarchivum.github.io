Is there a way to merge accounts? I say this for I have 3 accounts I rarely or never use anymore. The problem being I have bought RP on all of my accounts. (in which I own 4 accounts) I do not wish to waste said RP and skins. I do however understand that this could be abused so I do also wonder if there is a record for what Skins / Champions were bought with RP / IP  or earned VIA chest. If I can't get the accounts merged that is also fine I am just curious. My main account would be fine without the other 3 but I would appreciate acquiring the skins / icons from the other accounts. Following suite I do not wish if I have duplicates to get refunds for those in any way however on the other hand if you were to refund _**nudge nudge wink wink**_ that would be very very appreciated. Like if I have a duplicate skin, the account being merged to gets maybe a 12.5% refund of the RP or a duplicate champion only 25% of the IP, but if the skin or champion was earned by a chest then don't refund anything at all. That is all I have in terms of explaining this.\r\n\r\n    **-Thank You,**\r\n     ToxicRemody","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-09T00:30:59.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There currently isn't a feature to merge accounts.
