CONNECTION ISSUE!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Up until just yesterday, the game was working well and smoothly, however now I have a constant problem **IN GAME!** The UI just stops responding at frequent intervals (during these times I click everywhere, but there are no green arrows indicating where I am attempting to move my champ and I cannot open the shop. I can Alt + Tab and my laptop still works fine during these times). I tried putting all the video settings to the lowest possible quality, however it's always the same result. Please do not reply to this with questions on my specs. It cannot be my specs otherwise this problem would have occurred previously. I'm looking for a real solution. \r\n\r\nI am also using this method to ping Riot's server to test my connection and it does not look like I have any interruptions in my connection either:\r\n**https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/EqXY8ERt-how-to-ping-riots-servers-to-test-your-connection**\r\n\r\nI'd really appreciate if someone could help me in my time of need! \r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-06-06T17:26:55.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty frustrating when you're just trying to enjoy a game of League and your client goes wonky on you! It does sound like your client is having an issue obtaining information from the Server. The first thing I would suggest is putting your client into low spec mode from the game settings. If the issue persists from there it would be a great idea to run through the steps in our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664)! \n\nIf that fails, reach back out to me and we'll have our tech team dive a little deeper into the issue! \n{{champion:25}}","replies":[]}]}
