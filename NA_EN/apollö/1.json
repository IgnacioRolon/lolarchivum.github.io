A decent hp increase, 2. Moderate attack stat, and 3. The ability to shred armor with stacks which work in conjunction with his E (The spin) and with the 2nd passive that increases move speed when you hit an enemy. This basically allows him to murder tanks and non-tanks relatively fast since just one spin is enough to get their hp decently low. \n\nBut it doesn't make him broken though it only makes him a lot stronger early game just due to that single item.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2018-10-11T22:55:41.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"But muh it's designed for juggernauts excuse. \n\nNevermind the fact a class designed to be able to easily take on 2 enemies at once, with items to match, only makes sense in a purely PvE game.","replies":[]}]}
