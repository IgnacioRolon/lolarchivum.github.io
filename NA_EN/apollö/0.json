I played him with my Ekko Top and got First blood on him. But as soon as he got a specters cowl I could do no more damage to him, yet with only this specers cowl he was able to beat me like a small child with his high base damage. He also has insane passive on his W allowing him to get up with 40 Armor and MR so he can build a damage item with HP very efficiently.\n\nHis team fighting can either be really good or really terrible. If your team has a bunch of slows he can be useless, but if you lack slows he can be very problematic. While you cannot focus him due to his high resists and HP, you cannot ignore him either if he is on your back line as his damage is pretty strong especially with a BC or Trinity. \n\nHis win rate in Gold + is 52% which I think  is a bit high for a very simple champion, which only lowers to 50.8% in plat +, but does go all the way down to 48% in diamond plus. His overall winrate in bronze plus is around 53% so I would say he is a bit overtuned for a champion that anyone can play very easily. I do believe they need to either nerf his base damage and raise his free resistances or vice versa to put him in a better place.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SÞarx","date":"2018-10-25T02:40:02.728+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I comepletely agree with you but I feel like he's more of a low elo stomper, like yi.","replies":[{"poster":"Doge2020","date":"2018-10-25T18:26:09.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I think so too. people like the OP, don’t really know how to play against Garen and generally don’t really know a lot of the champions weaknesses.
