Be sure to report where you are experiencing it exactly, as any information can help with testing!  In the meantime, you can also return to the legacy client:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nThanks for your help!","replies":[]}]}
