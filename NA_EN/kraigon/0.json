I've read severaly articles saying if you had an escalated ban (i.e 7-14 day ban) you would not recieve end of season rewards, but, my ban was not escalated. i was never once chat banned, or 24 hour banned or anything like that. It was my first punishment i'd ever gotten in league. As the ban was not escalated, since i had no warning before hand (chat ban, or anything) do i still not recieve end of season rewards?  Thankyou for you help :D Slayzer","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-10-27T23:47:25.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Slayzer787, \n\nTo get the best help you can possibly get for this question, it will probably be best to submit a ticket into Riot.
