The bar above my friends list says \"Champion Select 0:30\" and nothing happens. The timer is frozen, I can't access the champ select screen. So I tried closing and got the dodge penalty screen when I try to join a game.\r\n\r\nAlso a side bug, some of the font in chat during the game is distorted. Like \"r\" is missing part of the letter in some sentences.\r\n\r\nAny ideas what's going on?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-04T03:20:55.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes that can happen if your network can't get a strong enough signal to the server, so you're never fully placed into the lobby.
