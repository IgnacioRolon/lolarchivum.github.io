I&#039;ve heard that your rank follows you from season to season even though they claim there is a &quot;reset&quot; - I don&#039;t want to go into season 8 as bronze, so if I don&#039;t finish my placements will that still effect my elo going into season 8 or do you have to actually be placed for the ranked system to effect you permanently?","replies":[]}
