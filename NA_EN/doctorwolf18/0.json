Which my computer is already so freaking old so here is a list of the bugs I have seen while playing Sion with this skin.\r\n\r\n1. (Funny and just fun) Yesterday I did a match and it was mirror Sion Vs Mecha Sion me and the Sion had fun. We would ult at each other for fun after we hit each other and I killed him. The Enemy Sion would have the same death animation as Mecha Sion. And also his body would just be pure grey while his limbs were the same as Mecha Sion color wise.\r\n\r\n2. Many weird blue boxes pop up were I guess buffs are randomly have no clue what they are.\r\n\r\n3. Mecha Sion when ulting doesn&#039;t do the transform into train animation and steering is harder like he flips out.\r\n\r\n4. While ulting he randomly just stops not even when you hit or press r again or reach the out of range for his ult.  \r\n\r\n5. While ulting when someone flashes in front of me to stop me I get stunned so long like if there was a Morgana. (Note one of the matches had a enemy Morgana but her snare never hit me after i was stopped.","replies":[{"poster":"DoctorInju","date":"2016-04-19T12:24:07.180+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/5/54/SionMechaZero.attack10.ogg/revision/latest?cb=20160324182143","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-04-18T23:13:22.422+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey DoctorWolf18 - \n\nThanks for the report! \n\n> (Funny and just fun) Yesterday I did a match and it was mirror Sion Vs Mecha Sion me and the Sion had fun.

It's an engineering issue that we're currently looking into. :)\n\n> Many weird blue boxes pop up were I guess buffs are randomly have no clue what they are.\n\nUsually when there are blue boxes, there are missing textures. I'm not able to repro this one. This may be a case of a particle in general failing to load in game, or a file jumbled. If this only happened in one game, I would suggest doing a system repair. \n\n> Mecha Sion when ulting doesn't do the transform into train animation and steering is harder like he flips out.\n\nCould you be more specific in when he's not turning into a train? I'm able to have him transform without issues on my computer. If you have a video of this, it'd be super helpful. Could you describe what you mean by him flipping out?\n\n> While ulting he randomly just stops not even when you hit or press r again or reach the out of range for his ult.\n\nIs this under a specific circumstance? Unfortunately, I can't repro this one either. \n\nThanks! :)","replies":[{"poster":"DoctorWolf18","date":"2016-04-21T00:30:28.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well for the he doesn't transform no I can't get a video cause if I did you would just see like 2 frames. But what I can describe best as I can is this. The global noise works but as he tries to spin into the transformation it stops and he \"poofs\" into the train without finishing the transformation.\n\nAnd when he just stops like I don't have to hit anything he would just stop like in the middle of a lane not near a turret champion or wall. He just does the animation of when he impacts and has cost me sometimes to almost die or die.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-04-27T21:59:05.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, okay. I see what you mean now. It's intended that there is a bit of a poof as he's flipping into the train that's going to charge down the lane. \n\nI'm still not able to repro the second part here. I'm not able to get him to stop randomly. I've had a 100% success rate in terms of launching his ult and having it move in the targeted direction. If you have a video of this, that would be wicked helpful! :D","replies":[]}]}]}]}
