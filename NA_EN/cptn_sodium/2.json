Not by a long shot, to be honest. But you also didn't try to be constructive; most of what you said had very little to do with strategy or morale-boosting.\n\nThe main offense I can see here is that you spent most of the game pointing out bad play and \"trolls\", as well as declaring your intent to mute and report (you didn't directly say you would report someone, but \"enjoy the punishment\" heavily implies that you meant to). These things *almost never* improve the game or the environment in any way; they will almost always escalate the situation further, and can actually be reported as harassment.\n\nhttp://media.lolusercontent.com/api/embedly/1/image/resize?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2F1HvNiEO.png%3Fnoredirect&key=a45e967db0914c7fb472fd4381e6c85b&width=150","replies":[{"poster":"Buff Jhin","date":"2016-10-05T21:27:29.986+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GaleWinUnleashed,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=nGE0juLB,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-10-05T21:16:51.895+0000)\n>\n> Well you aren&#x27;t exactly the most toxic person I&#x27;ve ever seen.
