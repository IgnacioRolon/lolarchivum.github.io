EVERY CHAMPION SELECT","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every champion select i lag out once or twice, and most of the time dodge and get banned. I&#039;m talking to my friends using discord so I know that there is no internet connection issues. I did everything on the internet connectivity article on the support site. but still EVERY champion select I lag out and dodge. I wish i could fucking play this damn game, but the servers keep getting disconnected for literally no reason.\r\n\r\nIts so frustrating to be dedicated to a game but keep getting banned because you cant even stay connected to champion select.\r\n\r\nIs there some way to manually reconnect to champion select when your client doesn&#039;t know? It seems like it take 10 minutes for the client to even recognize that its not connected before I dodge right as i finally reconnect.\r\n\r\nOn the extremely rare case that I find a game, my internet connection is perfect with no lag.","replies":[{"poster":"Radiolarian","date":"2017-08-04T00:11:18.430+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just wanted to share that I have been experiencing this for 3 years. I've actually been through the process of a ticket, submitting a whole host of logs and bits of information to riot technical support on my main account, had my ISP out on multiple occasions to swap modems, provide alternative firmware, and also gone through the entire connection issues guide (on both fresh win8.1 and win10 installs) in an effort to correct the problem.\n\nThe reason that I felt compelled to share is that, on my main account, I had over 500lp lost in seasons 4, 5, and 6. On this account, I've easily been through 100+ in season 7 alone. Every time I get exceptionally frustrated by the perpetual nature of the problem I sift through forum posts to see if anyone else is experiencing the same thing. To my great surprise, not only are countless people over the last 3 years on your forums complaining about the same issue with the same impact on their ranked accounts, but the response from every riot employee is the same; we suggest going to the same page that people have been telling us doesn't help for half a decade. To be honest, its getting past the point of patronizing and is borderline unethical from a business perspective....especially so in a business that is so lucrative on the hosts end. High time someone at riot took this seriously and stopped assuming we are a bunch of technologically inept luddites that simply cant follow their connection issues instructions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-04T23:19:16.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have a weak connection then you can lose sync in champion section and get left behind.  It's not possible to re-enter the group with everyone else, but you can troubleshoot your network to resolve the connection problem.  I suggest running through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to strengthen up your connection.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
