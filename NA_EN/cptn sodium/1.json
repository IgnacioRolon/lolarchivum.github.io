Remember, when you reach your correct matchmaking rating, you will win/lose 50% of the games.\n\nActually, I have a bone to pick with your analogy.  Regardless of wins/losses; that running backs statistics ARE important and DO effect what happens over time.  The guy who runs 100 yards a game (I'm making this up at the moment but bear with me) is open for better contracts, better trades, better endorsements and IS ranked higher than the guy who ran for 20 yards a game but whose team won more.  Does he get a super bowl ring out of losing each game even though the player put up monstrous statistics? No, but does his ranking among players improve. YES.\n\nI feel like it's false logic EVERY time you or anyone else at RIOT stress how much it's a team game. Yes. Wins and Losses are team related. Who wins the super bowl is team related. Who wins Nascar is team related, who wins the world series is team related. but in EVERY one of those sports. The INDIVIDUAL performance of any player in the league regardless of wins or losses is taken into account ESPECIALLY for ranking them.  Typically the win/loss does play a large factor but it's not everything.  \n\nAnd I feel like that's just it. There's no respect for the consistent player that may not win as much but makes the most out of each game. I've watched heartbroken as my 8/1/11 lead evaporates as my team runs headlong down mid to die. I've been there for the 500 cs, 70 minute game where I'm praying that the zed actually targets their carry this time instead of their full build tank T_T... I've seen the frustration of my duo winning bot lane, pressuring mid lane, taking dragon, only to have top and jg die 32 times.  \n\nAnd the examples go on... and on... and on... the big difference in many real sports is that when you look at those sports, the teams are on similar levels. Each player on the team is on a similar level. They're the 0.01% who made it into professional sports. They're the freaks of nature that can hold 280 lbs on their frame and run a 3.8 40 yard dash.  But it's just not comparable to LoL outside of LCS.  And honestly, I'd be happy with my teams being on similar levels most of the time. I'm fine with legit losses. Even blowouts. When my teams actually trying, doing what they're supposed to be doing and just losing the plays, I accept it. But from where I'm sitting it's 1 in a dozen losses.  I see it all the time. Whether it's 4 people with 2/1/2 type kda's and the random 5th wheel 0/10/0 or the Yasou that went 12/28 and thinks they did the team a favor or a million other scenarios I think there's a VERY BIG PROBLEM with presenting a ranking system that doesn't incorporate ANYTHING about our individual play.  I can literally get an S every game (and I've gone on losing streaks where I've had an S in every game) and it's not worth anything? Jokes about the validity of the grading system aside, I've really yet to hear a convincing argument for why we're RANKED in accordance with how our team performs when no other sport in the world does it that way.  If Faker was forced to play with B5 trash that fed 10 kills to every kill he got and lost every game... would that make him anything but the single best player to play the game?\n\nBefore this becomes a novel I'll make my last point.  If it's supposed to be a team game and only a team game... why is the chat so lackluster? Why is finding a team so frustrating? The Team Recruitment forums are honestly a joke. The websites you can go to are just that... other websites and they're not all that great.  If there's \"team game\" win as a team, die as a team... then why isn't there a more concerted, RIOT approved, effort to help players find teams?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Investa","date":"2016-10-06T21:03:42.611+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Burklight,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=BAazeesU,comment-id=0001000400000001,timestamp=2016-10-06T20:19:28.515+0000)\n>\n> I don&#x27;t believe you should be punished for behavior for having a bad game.

This simply isn't true and if you think so it's wrong. Yes, 10k damage in a typical 45 minute game on an ADC is pretty poor, but without any other context, does this alone mean that this player had a disproportionately negative effect on the team and secured the loss? Would you value a player with more kills and more deaths, rather than a player that just had a lot of deaths? Why? Did you know that every kill resets your bounty to 300g, and every assist slowly brings it up a percentage back to its full 300g value? Therefore, in terms of actual feeding the enemy team, a player who goes 12/8/4 is feeding more than a player going 0/10/2. Considerably more. These are things that nobody considers or thinks about.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that likely the person with the best score that everyone thinks is the \"carry\" might not even have the highest champion damage. A lot of times it is actually the player with the worse scores. There are so many variables to this game that treating it by competitive team death-match rules is just ignorant.\n\nThe idea of penalizing players who perform particularly badly is just not a good idea, so much as the current system of rewarding players for playing good with the champion mastery. You can get an S rank in a losing game, and if one person can solo carry a game to failure, surely one person can solo carry them to victory, no? Consider more options in approaching victory than team-fighting and jacking up those numbers.","replies":[{"poster":"Burklight","date":"2016-10-07T14:17:37.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was using the 10k damage in a 45 minute game as an example. It's very clearly not the only indicator that someone played terribly, and I'm not suggesting we should only look at one of those numbers.

Nothing is more demoralizing for me than to have an S+ game where I can 1v3 the adc support and mid on the other team only to lose anyway because my adc and mid may as well be afk. I know I'm not alone or special in that feeling either. Everyone has been there a few times. That's a pretty extreme example, but you _know_ you've played games before that you deserved to win, but didn't because one or two people on your team absolutely deserved to lose.
