I saw other players have this problem aswell and saw the little excalamation mark thingy pointing out the problem. Since then I played in windowed and when excalamation mark thingy dissapeared I tought it was resolved but it turns out it wasn't (at least for me). Any ideas on how to fix it since in windowed my FPS is gutted.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-04T00:06:46.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you did successfully connect to the match, but something like a driver or hardware issue preventing the game from actually rendering.
