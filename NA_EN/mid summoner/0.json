You must be talking about bullying solo lanes, because I hate getting Lucians. Hes like a lane bully without the bully. All decently ranged ADCs just eat him alive.\n\nHe has to be the most feast or famine ADC right now. I play support, and he either pops off hard in lane because hes a really good player, or hes 100% useless the entire game. Even if he pops off in lane, with his range, half the time he just ends up useless anyways as the game scales on. I mean at least a vayne can scale into something.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2020-02-04T22:40:37.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All the stormrazor users got nerfed.

Other than that I don't think he's too insane, gimped by short range and worse teamfighting than other carries. I'm an Ezreal main and Lucian is one adc that I lose to nearly every game, but I don't think he's broken or insane. That's just a matchup I lose by default. Comes down to the fact that that's how the matchup goes; Ezreal's in a bad state, Lucian isn't; if both players are of equal skill, then I'll lose. He is a lane bully, more difficult to play than things like MF, but still very potent.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mid Summoner","date":"2020-02-04T22:03:36.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Im convinced the champion is insane\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/t6VsDN7.png[]","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mid Summoner","date":"2020-02-04T21:27:03.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly I think Crit might be overtuned, just won a game as MF Mid we lost Soul Elder Baron and won.
