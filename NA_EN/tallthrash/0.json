His Q has been nerfed in damage, yeah it now heals on impact, but overall it&#039;s not close to what it use to be. I can deal with the cast time, but it just so weak now. His W use to do freak damage, now it&#039;s the last  tool I level up in his kit, since the damage is fixed at it level one strength and 5.17 &quot;buff&quot; can hardly be called that, because you&#039;re more likely to kill with his Q or R, than his W. His E is probably the only legit buff in his rework since it slows, but I do miss the old Darius magic grab bug back 5.15. He&#039;s even slower now than before and with the mobility leading the charge since rework fiora, it&#039;s hard for him to compete. His new passive , now name Noxian Might, is hard to even achieve, since his attack speed has been nerfed and I use attack speed runes. Battles usually last 5-6 seconds and that&#039;s about as long as it takes to reach 5 stacks be R being unlocked. Building tank Darius sets you up for failure , since all tank items have been nerfed in someway. Full AD Darius is pretty nice, but even then he doesn&#039;t feel OP at all. I lose very often with him and the only wins I get are from players that are completely intimidated by him. He wouldn&#039;t be this bad if Riot actually buffed his Q.","replies":[{"poster":"blade0214","date":"2015-09-08T03:46:18.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he is super op right now.... all those claims are bullshit.  he can now sustain in lane and has no reason to go back.  all his spells seem to cost nothing to cast as he sits around and spans Q all day.  not to mention, he just moves in range and Q's you to get passive stacks.  now, lets talk about how he DEMOLISHES any top melee champ.  he is broken now since the patch... wtf riot","replies":[]},{"poster":"CptPic4rd","date":"2015-09-03T00:11:54.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is super op right now, at least in my low elo. And BTW building him full tank is great. You're hard to kill, do good base dmg with Black Cleaver, and when u get your passive up you do crazy damage.\n\nAlso, his Q is amazing now. Heal 15% of missing HP every 4 - 5 seconds?? Just kite in and out of fights, dmging with your q.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YUUKI VK","date":"2015-09-02T09:50:51.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I main him big time. I take it you are low elo, as he is bullshit atm, that's why he is ban or picked higher up. I rarely get to play my main.\n\nand btw run AS runes get a blade triforce and tank, then come back to me. if you cant do well with that, its just you","replies":[]}]}
