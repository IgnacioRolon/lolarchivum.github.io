I tried to finish yesterday and after winning a match I was told that I had QUALIFIED for my promos instead of being promoted. I'm not sure if this is a bug or not but I'm pretty miffed. I'm positive that I didn't complete my promos and that win should have been my 3rd and final promo game. Now I'm back on the grind trying to rekindle the win streak.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-20T00:45:23.627+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look at your account and it seems you dodged during your promo series, causing it to end. Your next win after that dodge earned you enough LP to jump back into another series again, which is why you experienced this.\n\nIf you have any questions, let me know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lew","date":"2017-01-20T00:01:20.092+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you had a dodge, whenever you dodge a game in a promo series it counts as a auto loss.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LoonAtLarge","date":"2017-01-21T02:06:48.955+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for the feedback guys, I do remember dodging that night. I nodded off during champ select and missed the lock in but I didn't realize that counted as a loss. I'll be more careful in the future, thanks for the help.","replies":[]}]}
