This would definitely have a high chance to cause crashes of the client anywhere before champ select. An unstable connection to the servers is typically the main cause of this to happen, which Rineyy has offered a great guide to address.\n\nShould you still have issues after working through the connection guide Rineyy linked, let me know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-07-21T08:18:54.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Troubleshoot your connectivity issues.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/su16_keyart_1920x1080_0.jpg?itok=6nj8mHjj","replies":[]}]}
