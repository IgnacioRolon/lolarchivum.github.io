Once I have  some mana regen EQ farms the entire wave. I'm like Xerath in that respect, but I also don't die.\r\n\r\nAnivia is awesome for 2 reasons. 1. is her passive, which means they can't all in  you, then leave you to die with ignite. Your tower is also MUCH safer. 2. is that once you get tear/catalyst, you can just farm with your ult from a distance forever, and throw Qs until you land one, then demolish the recipient.\r\n\r\nWhy are these two so uncommon? They're not hard. Galio's a bit susceptible to ganks early, but one ward fixes that.","replies":[]}
