And its the second time on me getting banned because of a jungler who is saying from the first minute that he will not gang, and u are ok with it, then starts flaming everybody and u are ok with it, THEN faking sabotages u, are u still ok with it? There are 4 players trying to play a game in LOL, and the 5th is trying to tilt them all. You ban the 4 and u let him go? again and agian? whats this report system in the end. i dont care losing, or someone doing bad. But someone sabotaging me the whole game since lvl 1. i cant stand it.

I absolutely am on board with the idea that their really is no excuse for flaming your teammates.  But I feel like players who ruin others' game experience but stay quiet in chat get away with a lot.\n\nYeah some people are just not as good at the game or don't understand certain elements, but I mean even if you don't understand that taking your mid's cannon cs is bad, you still can understand \"Hey, stop taking my CS, just stop the wave\".  I'm not saying Hurple's situation is a good example of this, but it does happen A LOT.\n\nJust a couple games ago I had a jungle Zac who just kept diving in and dying despite the fact that we were behind.  No one flamed him, but at some point he said something like \"No way we can win with this top and bottom anyway\" and then just kept forcing bad fights or dying alone somewhere.  Chain feeding without hard INTing.  Playing noticeably worse, knowing he was playing worse, because he doesn't give a crap.\n\nShouldn't we have some sort of sweet spot where refusing to cooperate with team is considered just as heinous a crime as INTing is?  Our system is a bit one sided.  If someone in game is being disrespectful of their team by playing like they don't care at all, then they get flamed for it by team, in my mind BOTH PARTIES ARE EQUALLY GUILTY AND SHOULD BE PUNISHED.  Like at a school if a kid is irritating the crap out of another kid then gets punched, the faculty will punish both sides, not just the kid who hit.\n\nI'd like to see trolls getting banned just as regularly as flamers IMO.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-02-01T12:53:08.175+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taking CS is not an act of trolling.","replies":[{"poster":"Whisper87","date":"2018-02-02T15:37:28.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Not in and of itself no.

Again in that situation when you specifically ask them to stop and they keep doing it, you done goofed.\n\nSame deal as when your jungle gets tilted when behind and just spams ganks and engages despite the whole team asking him to stop.  \n\nWhen you stop doing what you truly think is the best thing to do to win, and just start doing random stuff or things you know is not good, that's trolling and should be reported and banned as such.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-02-02T15:42:35.675+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know whether I would agree with you.

He might tell me to stop, but based on how I saw him play, I've already stopped trusting him and classified him as a walking ward / sandbag. \n\nHe can report and complain to me all he wants, but in my eyes, giving him resources would be a bad macro decision, as he'll just end up standing at a poor location and die early without able to contribute, so might as well have someone better make use of that gold.

It's about people asking you to stop, and are you really doing what you think is best for the team or are you just trying to spite someone.  It's about giving 100% effort even when things have started to head south.

Sure I've done that before as well and it feels like crap when there is a giant wave and the mid laner comes in a swipes everything in 1 shot.

Three of whom have to listen to you flaming?\n\nBecause that's how Riot sees it - one bad egg ruins the game for four to nine other players, and if one of those other players becomes a bad egg, that's only making the game worse for the other three, potentially eight, who are just trying to play an honest match.\n\n---\n\nTL;DR, you got banned for your own actions, not those of some random Jungler.
