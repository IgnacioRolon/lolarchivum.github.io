I&#039;m guessing you guys had problems with rengar already being white, and the uniform being white. Why not make rengar&#039;s fur blue instead of the brown mess that the skin currently is. Idk I am just dissatisfied as a person who plays rengar a lot, and the skin I have been waiting for looks kind of blah IMO.\n\nAlso, this looks like sweeper alistar but with worse colors. gg\nhttp://www.wellplayed.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/b2ap3_thumbnail_AlistarSweeper.jpg\n\nEdit: They changed the texture... http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7SCSQc38OuQ/VUGToCLBFmI/AAAAAAAApHA/DETvRk1B-lA/s1600/RENGARCOMPARE.jpg But it still has the same problems I was talking about.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-04-29T20:30:17.528+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hiya! \n\nThanks for your feedback! \n\nWe're currently looking at potential texture changes to differentiate SSW Rengar from Sweeper Alistar.","replies":[{"poster":"Budupops","date":"2015-04-29T21:13:44.176+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"is there any chance he can be entirely redone?
