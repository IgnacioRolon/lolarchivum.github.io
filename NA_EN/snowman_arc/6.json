Tick that over to Win-rate.  Talon, Fizz, Kat are in teh top 10 win-rates in DIamond+, with Zed and Ekko slightly out at 12/13. And, Talon is NUMBER 1. Fizz is NUMBER 3. When people around here constantly say Assassins cant do their job, Fizz sucks, yadda yadda yadda, and this is at the highest level where people play the best.\n\nI linked Gold+ because the VAST majority of people on this forum crying constantly about game balance and champ balance fall into the Bronze-Gold Category, so what happens in high elo is really of no consequence to their game. Gold+ is more realistic here. Even at Bronze+, Fizz, Ekko, Yasuo, are in the top 10 win-rates mid. Zed falls slightly out but still played a ton. Hell, if you tick Bronze+ over to play-rate, almost the entire top 10 is nothing but assassins. 3 mages in the top 10 of play-rates Bronze+, and one of them is Ahri which is more like an assassin.\n\nAssassins have huge play-rates in solo Q. They even have huge win-rates. This narrative people keep trying to push on the forums for their bad play on said champs is annoying. I mean one look at actual stats tells you that they are good. The only issue is supports are good, too. So they probably do get shut down by support play from time to time; so be it. I mean they aren't struggling.
