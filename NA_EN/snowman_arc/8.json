A team that caught my attention is SKT, because I also heard that they have won World Championships. I was really surprised to see them be already 0-2 so far in summer, and on Wednesday, they lost to another team.\r\n\r\nThey did win one game in that best of three though, but today, they lost again to another team, this time with another line up. I&#039;m really wondering why they used this new roster of Faker, Bang and Wolf today. They really didn&#039;t perform well. This new SKT line up isn&#039;t strong. I much preferred the old SKT roster with Pirean, Leo, Effort, Blossom and Thal. This old SKT roster won one game on Wednesday, but this new SKT with Faker, Bang, Wolf and Blank didn&#039;t even win a game.\r\n\r\nThey should really just stick to their main roster. Their sub roster just doesn&#039;t cut it.","replies":[]}
