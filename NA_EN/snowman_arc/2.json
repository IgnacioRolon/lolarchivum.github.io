I had also played another Viktor game like a month ago.\r\n\r\nWow, I must tell, I felt helpless the entire game. It doesn&#039;t matter how many cs you go up on your enemy laner, it doesn&#039;t matter how many levels you are ahead of them, or how many kills you have or if you got first tower, you still feel helpless, if ANY other lane + the jungler have some sort of advantage. \r\n\r\nYou can&#039;t roam because you&#039;re probably gonna 1v1 the jungler and die and just sitting in lane wave clearing won&#039;t help either. Eventually, the fed enemy team comes mid and nullifies any advantage you have.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I&#039;ve never felt so helpless and this is coming from a player who plays a lot of Graves on the alt account and picks up easy wins. Even in scenarios where my team is behind, I have some agency over the game with Graves jungle and I can do something to turn it around. Viktor, and I assume in other game, just feels so helpless. It&#039;s so much coinflip, hoping that your other lanes don&#039;t hard feed.","replies":[{"poster":"dunder kill","date":"2018-05-13T23:04:31.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think your problem is Viktor is trash tier atm\n\nhttp://na.op.gg/champion/viktor/statistics/mid","replies":[{"poster":"Snowman Arc","date":"2018-05-14T08:47:51.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even though I know that Viktor is trash currently, I feel that playing Orianna or Syndra wouldn't make much of a difference because the same problems would be present.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-13T23:05:25.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Mages are totally busted OP in lower ELO - any ranged burst is.","replies":[]}]}
