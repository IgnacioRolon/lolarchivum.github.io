This is the PBE.  As explained along the way, it's the area for players to assist and work with Riot, it's not the same as the general consumer servers.  It has different standards being a different situation.  Your actions there results in a permanent ban without appeal.\nThere is not anything unusual about what happened.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-01-16T01:08:00.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a pretty grievous offense, but I would've expected a 14-day for an account with no prior actions against it.

Submit a support ticket to Riot and they'll eventually (after the initial canned response) explain the situation, which is mostly likely a prior punishment you forgot about.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MrFawknSunshine","date":"2019-01-16T01:05:23.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well you can submit a support ticket and ask for a review but i doubt you will have any luck","replies":[{"poster":"UnusualPlace","date":"2019-01-16T01:07:04.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you send me a link to it?","replies":[{"poster":"MrFawknSunshine","date":"2019-01-16T01:28:14.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"scroll to the top of this page , hover the mouse on the top left corner where it says \"explore league\" a menu should open and click on support and go from there","replies":[]}]}]}]}
