After the whatever lane they are trying to swap to refuses the swapping, the enraged and now trolling autofilled player bans the player's hover as an act of protest and revenge (even though it's clearly a wrong on their part, because they're not entitled to a swap nor is intentionally banning an ally's hover a good conduct itself).
