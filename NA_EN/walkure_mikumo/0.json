And I have to hold the power button to restart my PC. How to fix this? I tried and find out that this problem only exists in League of legends.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-16T02:36:05.909+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're running the latest Windows 10 Creator Update 1703. If that's the case, the creator updates are currently in beta and still have a number of bugs to iron out. That alt+esc issue will probably be fixed if you're able to revert back to the official windows release. If you really want to keep trying that update, hit us up in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we might be able to troubleshoot!","replies":[{"poster":"UekiHunter","date":"2017-06-24T14:42:00.939+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have the same problem and thanks to that i got i had leaver boster for the third time in a row its really annoying i'm trying to fix it but i still can't and the result is i need to waste alot more time in a queue thanks to a dumb windows update can't u help me with my punish part ?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zexkillanox","date":"2017-04-17T09:53:01.654+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem!!
