Anyway, as per the advice received in the thread I sent in a ticket asking Riot to permaban the account.  I genuinely felt upset that I had bothered to troll a ranked game when I could've possibly gotten the account suspended without ruining anyone's in-game experience.  Well that remorse is completely gone now.  What is the point of submitting a ticket if Riot literally just copy-pastes a response to it?  Unbelievable.  Just look at that response.  There is no way a human read my ticket and typed that out.  What a fucking joke.  It's disappointing, but sadly I'm going to have to troll at least one more ranked game here in a couple of weeks in order to actually get the account perm'd.  GG Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"I Like Teemo","date":"2019-11-01T06:21:25.471+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"account should already be perm banned on the grounds of \"i bought this account from a guy\"","replies":[{"poster":"pyscHOTicTwinkle","date":"2019-11-01T06:24:23.948+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"You'd think so....  If anything this is proof that anyone on these boards claiming they were permabanned unfairly is completely full of shit.

Trying to trigger a permanent ban as a first offence through chat use is practically impossible.\n\nTry responding to the ticket again, and make it clear that you bought the account and used it to Smurf (which, if you're using the term correctly there, would be the equivalent of intentionally losing games to tank mmr). Second response should haev them actually read the ticket properly and address the issue in question, plus a personalised response.\n\nFirst responses tend to be copy-paste type things, and the Support agents will sometimes skin the ticket for key words/phrases, which is probably why they've missed the stuff that would actually lead them to perma-ban the account.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-11-01T11:07:54.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They do read it.
