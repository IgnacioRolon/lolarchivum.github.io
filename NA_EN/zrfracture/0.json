I will also once inside the client (if that happens) randomly disconnect from the client and have to roll the dice again to see if I can log in. Every other application and website loads and works very quickly so this is clearly an isolated issue with the client. I have tried the Hextech Repair tool, reupdating, and reinstalling and this is still happening DAILY.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-21T00:44:35.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're having such a hard time getting a solid connection to our authentication servers there's likely something getting in the way and blocking your connection from being able to reach our login servers.
