However, like the OP I just received a summoner icon from Hextech Crafting called \"Little Devil Teemo\" . However, the icon isn't Little Devil Teemo (since I have it) and is actually the Star Guardian Pix icon. Do you guys receycle/reuse the same source code for different events but change certain elements? That would explain why the SG Pix icon said it was the Teemoing icon\n\n-rekd1","replies":[]}]}]}
