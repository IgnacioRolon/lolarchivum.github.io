I haven't been able to explicitly reproduce it based on champion (I mean, it's random after all), but it's happened since at least Jan 7, 2015 (patch 4.21 by the stamp on the Nami image). It happened again recently that I noticed so I took another screenshot - I wasn't doing anything particularly different of note as far as I'm aware in either case compared to just entering a normal ARAM game.","replies":[]}
