I my role was bottom.\r\n\r\nAnother player then banned Sivir and said in chat &quot;lol Sivir. Brainded champ. I don&#039;t want to play jungle. Please dodge so I can go into another game.&quot;\r\n\r\nI was shocked. I asked why he banned my character. The other player said so that I would be discouraged and then dodge, and so that he wouldn&#039;t incur the dodge penalty. At that point I realized my selection timer was running out and I desperately tried to pick another ADC quickly, but then it did and I was kicked out. Most of  my timer had been spent trying to understand what had happened to my character and where she had gone, then in shock. \r\n\r\nThat player, by accident got what they wanted. A new game and me paying for in in dodge penalty. \r\n\r\nI am SO sick of other players be able to ban a character that one of their teamates have declared. Please stop this.","replies":[{"poster":"Crispy0Snake","date":"2018-12-02T02:40:51.486+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is an awful idea... If one of my allies wants to play something meta and they're not first pick, I might ban it because I don't want to play against it. \n\nOn the same note, if I'm first pick, I will often pick it for them!\n\nSure trolls and e-scumbags exist but what can ya do. You could play another waveclear adc like Trist/Jinx and pay more attention to the ban phase!","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2018-12-02T02:34:55.466+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's ignore your specific example for a second and ask ourselves:\nWhat's the purpose of banning champions at all?\nTo make sure they don't end up on the enemy team.\n\nSo, why is it allowed to ban declared champs?\nTo make sure they don't end up on the enemy team.\n\nThat's as simple as it gets.\n\nComing back to your specific example:\nSure, people can use that feature to piss others off... but the same applies to being able to block high priority bans by hovering them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-12-02T02:15:20.481+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cos it sucks to have your yasuo feed 5 million kills while their yasuo is always godlike. \n\n\nMoral of story, always ban yasuo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheProfezzor","date":"2018-12-02T07:01:19.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People can be assholes.

If that was ranked and in my elo (gold) I don’t trust yasuos unless there are knock up champs...so yeah I may ban your declared champ if most players aren’t good with them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SSJuniverse","date":"2018-12-02T02:24:36.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the arguement is you should know, or be trying to learn a wide selection of champs. Which i agree with but that shouldnt shut down somone who is a one trick player. I feel like atleast in a rank game pre-selected champs shouldnt be bannable by teammates","replies":[]},{"poster":"LetMeCarry1983","date":"2018-12-02T08:54:43.349+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"You know, if people would lock in troll picks every time this happens, people would stop doing it. Just like how every Korean knows that if they feed, their allies would open mid. Do your part. Lock in a troll pick and watch as your team falls apart when it doesn't do so well. Let it be burned into their souls what happens when someone bans a team mate's pick. We need the players to enforce this standard so we never have to deal with this shit ever again.","replies":[]}]}
