I said in response, \"takes a mentally challenged guy to tell you how to counterplay blitz\". Context isnt difficult. Secondly, and htis is most important, asking to report someone isnt bannable. It  IS if you constantly say it. Ive posted this information lots of times. Im taking it you are an american so i cant hold you to the first world education standards for other nations for missing all the stuff i am now repeating.","replies":[{"poster":"Jonxx","date":"2016-03-20T10:15:13.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"True, in this context it's not really toxic. You should try to push this further on Riot Support if you didn't yet. Because if we remove that there's only a bit of negativity left and report calling. YES report calling is bannable, or at least so I hear a lot on these boards, but I could't find Riot's stance on it.\n\nThis might be enough for ban nonetheless though, but don't take my word for it.
