Check server status here, if it looks good follow the guide here.\"\nAs i said, nor the tickets to \"recover my account\" nor changing password seemed to work, I just want to play plz :c","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-27T00:10:05.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, I must mention that *account sharing* of **any kind** is not something we recommend since it often leads to losing an account or compromising its integrity.\n\nIf you were trying to *recover your account* using our [Riot Support page](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us), you'll actually need to **log out of your account** so that it says \"Sign In\" in the top right of the page. Next, you'll want to submit a ticket using [**this specific form**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) to ensure your ticket is sent to the right team and that you won't have to submit another one.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
