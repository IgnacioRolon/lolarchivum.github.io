I updated to W10 quite some time ago and recently a problem came out of nowhere. \r\nI'm playing the game on a 26in 4k screen, which is imo too big for the game to play it in full screen. Therefore I have been running it in window mode on 2560x1600. While I was playing, a windows message popped up and the game was resized. This means, the whole window got smaller but with a higher resolution. Now I'm having a hard time clicking on minions and stuff because everything's so tiny.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have an idea on how to manually increase the window size (which means also lowering the resolution --> thats what  I want)?\r\n\r\nThank you so much, can't play anymore because of this and couldnt find an answer elsewhere.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-10T16:22:39.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently, 4k isn't supported so you'll find resolution issues like this.  Your best bet would be to reduce resolutions on your game or monitor to resolve this.  If possible, try not to alt tab around either as it could exasperate your screen.  Hopefully, this will restore a normal view for you!","replies":[{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-09-10T17:53:11.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suggest using actual Fullscreen instead of Borderless. It saves a lot of time on swapping resolutions if someone isn't marathoning games without any distractions.\nWindowed mode does allow the player to move the window to wherever they want it to be onscreen though.","replies":[]}]}]}
