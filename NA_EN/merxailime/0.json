I'm actually quite curious, did he get his 12 RP? I honestly wasn't expecting to see a reply like this. Is this something typically done in situations where people are off by a minute amount of RP (something below like, 15-20, or occasionally 15-20 but mostly 1-5, etc) or does something else contribute?\n\nOn a side note, if you do happen to respond, do you enjoy what you do on the forums? How long have you been a Red? Who's your favorite champion? :D","replies":[{"poster":"Merxailime","date":"2016-07-22T11:03:00.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry man i didn't get it\n\nits been 2 days since i sent in the ticket\n\nRito didn't say anything after this..........
