Lemme debrief ya.\n\nOnce you reach Lv 3 Honor, you have the chance of receiving Honor Capsules containing Loot inside them. These are given to you sometimes instead of key frags, and don't require a key to open. They'll always contain Key frags in them, and often they'll have Champion Shards in em too. There's also a rare chance in those capsules of getting the Honor exclusive skins Grey Warwick and Medieval Twitch. They're not even shards, they're straight up skins, and will give you the Champ for em too if you don't own em. :D\n\nThere's also the loading screen flairs. After games where a stranger or any 2 players give you an Honor vote, you'll receive a neat laurel on your loading border for the next few games to show off how great you've been doing lately! These flairs will continue to become more awesome looking as you keep being more and more awesome and grow your Honor level further too.","replies":[]}]}
