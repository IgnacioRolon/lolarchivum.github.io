Bot lane is still treated as synonymous with ADC and ADC is still treated as synonymous with marksmen.  They&#039;re more than half of the top 10 play rate champions, 9/10 of the most played bot lane champions, plenty with &gt;50% win rate, still building crit in their top winrate builds, still viable in lanes other than bot lane (Quinn is #1 highest winrate in top lane). Marksmen honestly need a lot more nerfs to make other classes even viable 25% of the time in bot lane. Marksmen mains are simply the most spoiled and loudest playerbase in the game.\n\nI am an angry support main who is fed up with nothing but marksmen for years. I want to be able to support other classes and I am sick of marksmen mains holding game balance hostage simply because of their number advantage due to this one champion class somehow having gotten to make up 25% of the total pick rates in the game.  Marksmen need more nerfs but they&#039;re getting buffs because Riot has heard their cries and apparently they can&#039;t afford to sell a few less Ezreal skins.\n\nBy the way, yes, the current meta sucks.  Buffing marksmen won't make tanks not die in 0.8 seconds though.  If anything, it will make that situation worse.  I agree playing marksmen and getting assassinated in 0.2 seconds with no reasonable counterplay feels like shit, but that's a separate issue.  Marksmen nerfs have been a step in the right direction, but other areas of balance have gone sideways in the meantime and are making the meta suck in unrelated ways.  Marksmen players begging for buffs and crit reverts are being unreasonable.","replies":[{"poster":"D357R0Y3R","date":"2018-06-30T20:37:40.340+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Hemulen Magi","date":"2018-06-30T22:33:43.565+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Apply the same standards of \"playability\" to other lanes/roles.

PLease. In my elo not sure why but people thinking \"omg because youtuber X did this bot lane that means we can play anything bot lane\" and now it's just ruining my games. Not much can do when top pick adc's are on the enemy team or one in general and feed their asses off thinking they can pull off what challenger players can do even though their game knowledge is much more vast","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2018-06-30T23:11:31.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as there exists a situation were tanks can only really be killed by marksmen if said tanks get past their early game somehow then the continued existence will never change.\n\nOf course tanks are probably feeling depressed though since riot decided that the counterplay to a tank was early game abuse and outscaling which leaves a dubious chance to carry mid/early lategame provided only they dont get crushed before they can get going.\n\n\nLets face it, i doubt assassins and early game champs can ever be viable at the same time as tanks/marksmen, it just wont happen as things are now.\n\nWould basically have to revert the tank rework, ditch runes alltogether and revert all stats changes to even stand a chance of stopping the situation of unstoppable forces vs immovable object.\n\nThen put some power back into defensive items again, this would make the users beefier in generals and lessen the difference between say juggernauts and tanks as in juggernauts melting instantly before that geared marksman while tank stands there for a respectable time.....or forever if the marksman lacks anti tank tools.\n\n\nIssue here is just like before though, tanks would lack a proper identity to separate them from other melee building tanky items......but i honestly prefer that to the current tanks that either explode or cant be killed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nyarlathοtep","date":"2018-06-30T22:46:08.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Marksmen are still mandatory\n\nMarksmen will always be mandatory as long as they remain the class that is able to kill tanks the best and taking down objectives the best (i feel like i killed my English there...).

Quinn is just abuses everything and fits perfectly for this meta. She needs a rework and nerfs as her kit is toxic. \n\nPeople play this game because they like champions - hence one tricks. \n\nThis post is ironic considering supports were also complaining  they were too weak. Assassins/Bruisers/Mages have been in every League game too. Your point marksmen are always in the game is pointless by that logic. \n\nMarksmen are not mandatory right now - that's why Morde and Swain have good winrates. Lucian got a buff specifically for him (Reaver),  MF/Draven have Conqueror, Jhin has Stormrazor and like Quinn a meta favoring him, while every other marksmen is useless.\n\nIf you want marksmen to get more nerfs, then enjoy being useless as a support role for 20 minutes in lane because you're tried to botlane since botlane is a 2-player lane and your ally cannot do anything. \n\nADC players are asking for indirect buffs. Longer game times, nerfs/changes to damage (Conqueror, Ignite), and tower buffs. Those 3 things will make them playable again.\n\nIf your class became obsolete for most of its pool and your favorite champions were included in it, how would you feel? Your post is basically saying gut the class. Toplaners got the same treatment and Riot Tryndamere commented on how shit it felt. Now ADCs are in the same spot","replies":[]}]}
