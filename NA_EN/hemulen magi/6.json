His early mana requirements prevent him from bullying during most of laning, since he usually can't invest in as much combat stats as his opponent. However, a lot of players lane against Yorick so rarely that they don't understand how to deal with his ghouls at all.  So instead of either A) removing the ghoul aggro by stepping into a bush, B) killing the ghoul, or C) building some sustain and tankiness then ignoring the ghouls, they'll choose D) running around the lane like a headless chicken and losing a lot of CS... \n\nI feel like top lane Yorick's power pattern is that he is strong up until his first recall (which tends to be early because he goes OOM), then he's usually mediocre (not exactly bad) for the rest of laning until he finishes his mana items, then he starts ramping back up and bringing his ult utility to teamfights or splitpushing.  \n\nIf you are experienced with Yorick's ult and have a good carry on your team to use it on, then he is extremely useful after laning.  Yorick really does best lategame, which is reflected in his winrate peaking around 40 minute game duration.  His ultimate is great for supporting his teammates and scales with the carries on his team.  I love Yorick because lategame he transitions into the most flexible, least selfish power, and most team supportive/utility juggernaut, which really fits my playstyle.  I feel like he's best played as a sort of bodyguard for your carries, smashing the head of anyone who gets too close while diving your ally, and temporarily reviving your ally if he/she gets bursted down.\n\nI strongly recommend you give Yorick a try.  He has been my favorite champion purchase in all of the years I have played.  I thought he was weak when I first bought him, but then I learned to manage his mana early on and all of the cool things I could do with his ultimate.  I haven't put him down since.  I love him top, jungle, and even support.  \n\nYorick is so flexible and fun.  I am doing my ranked promos for this season right now, and I have won 5/6 games so far as Yorick support.  Back when I was getting level 30 on this account, I went on a crazy win streak as jg Yorick where my whole match history was wins as far back as it would show... That was even before Yorick jg started catching on and was played in the LCS... Wait a sec...

Once you're in game start sapphire crystal or corrupting potion if you feel really cheesy, and start Omen of Famine.\n\nOmen of Famine is everything, it's your poke, your sustain, max it first in every situation and if you're missing more than like 80HP find your laner, drop it on him. Ghoul autos allow you to have GotU stacked up forever and since ghouls prioritize champions they won't just hard shove the lane either, so if your opponent thinks they want to man fight you drop E and punch them in the face for that HP drain based on your HP along with your ghoul healing you up.\n\nSkill order is R>E>Q>W, W gives a heavier slow with rank but once I reach the section on builds you'll understand why I 1 point wonder it these days. Q resets your auto attacks, make sure you get a normal hit in before you Q, it doesn't add tons of damage, but every little bit counts. You aren't going to have the following;\n1. Flashy plays, seriously, you do nothing with style or grace, you just get shit done\n2. Mobility, You're slow as hell, and your only speed boost requires you to punch something in the face with a digging tool\n3. Escapes, You don't get them, but neither does the enemy without a plethora of dashes i.e. Riven\n4. Fucks, You don't give them, not even the one, if you aren't burying your opponent alive, you're doing it wrong\n5. Burst damage. I can't stress this enough, Yorick has approximately 600 damage in a full rotation without building crazy amounts of AD, you don't just chunk people, use that to your advantage and push long engages to their limit because when people get chunked they bail, sustained damage doesn't phase people until they die\n\nOnto the full on playstyle portion of today's scheduled program. As I've said, max E, but do not under any circumstance neglect any of your abilities when it comes to point allotment, your passive gives you 5% bonus damage and 5% bonus damage reduction for every single extra unit you have on the field. If your opponent is aggresive towards you then be aggresive right back, short of a Mundo, Olaf, or Garen you out heal them by a mile, just don't get too cocky and waste too much, discretion is the better part of valor. If your opponent engages on you post level 3, drop E on them, auto, Q, auto, and when they start to back off drop W to keep them within reach, DO NOT drop W immediately unless you need to run away. Post 6 the world is one giant mass grave to you, find anyone willing to go toe to toe with you and smash them into the ground, if they get too close throw everything at them, when they turn around to fight you ult yourself for the extra resistances and damage and make it beat the crap out of them, at rank one it gets half your HP, and 45% of your damage, by then you should at least have tear if not a full manamune, keep spamming them down until dead. Late game you get a second AD carry for free, or if someone on your team is squishy as hell and being focused, they will still be able to kill people after they get focused down because you give them a second health bar for 10 seconds, and don't worry, sub-plat nobody even knows who Yorick is so there is about a 0.5% chance that anyone even realizes what your ult does/looks like, just make sure you tell your team that if they get a ghost of themselves to go absolutely ape shit ham.\n\nBuild\nSo Yorick has some interesting stuff in his build path, for starters Manamune is the most core item you will ever buy, seriously, you need that sweet sweet mana to keep finding bodies to throw at the enemy. Next up we got resistances, Sunfire Cape, Frozen Heart, Spirit Visage, this is your unholy trinity of bullshit. Sunfire keeps Grasp of the Undying stacking so long as any neutral or enemy unit is vaguely close to you and helps you push lanes, if your opponent is AD, get this as soon as you can after tear/manamune. If your laner is AP, nothing is funnier than rushing Spirit Visage and laughing maniacally as they flail at you attempting to do damage, your E healing ge\nts amped, your Grasp healing gets amped, and they can barely scratch you in the first place. Frozen Heart goes well with manamune since it gives you mana, it also gives CDR for more spam and the attack speed slow helps your ghouls not get gibbed as easily. From there you have some situationals, and those are getting their own split off section.\n\nA few items that Yorick can use fantastically well are Rylais Crystal Scepter, Duskblade Of Drakthar, Titanic Hydra, Iceborn Gauntlet, and Black Cleaver. Rylais gives every ghoul the same slow as your Omen of Pestilence (W) on hit, great for chasing people down and keeping them locked down for your team. Duskblade can be applied twice in a more damage centered build so long as you ult before you auto an enemy and Duskblade is not cooling down. Titanic Hydra gives you a lot of damage if you build more HP items, and your ult ghost gets the passive effect as well. Iceborn is more mana for Manamune, as well as the slow field and AoE damage to help clear waves and keep enemies in reach. Last but not least Black Cleaver... Black Cleaver is insane on Yorick in the right situation, and the right situation only. If your ADC is getting fed, or if you are getting fed, or if you have anyone who is doing somewhat well and is AD get cleaver. Ghouls proc the cleaver effect because it is counted as your damage, speeding you up and shredding their armor in the process, W lets you keep them in range to be hit by other ghouls and lets you close the gap to keep whacking them with your shovel. If you have both Rylais and Cleaver nobody runs, they're permanently slowed by 20% and you have the movement speed buff from Cleaver at all times, lead the charge and if someone steps out of line you crush them under a wave of corpses.\n\nNow get out there on the Fields of Justice and channel your inner gay cowboy, because everybody knows, {{champion:83}} digs {{champion:104}} .","replies":[{"poster":"aLawfulFalafel","date":"2016-03-04T02:24:10.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no no NO this must stop\nfacing a yorick in lane is scarier than an enemy shaco jungle, especially to noobs, stop telling people our secrets \n\nthanks obama","replies":[{"poster":"BIAKaboose","date":"2016-03-04T16:08:15.684+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, people asked, I delivered, don't hate the player, hate the game that lets the player overrun the world with an army of the undead and make crappy puns the whole time.\n\n(Edit) Also I'm a mastery 5 Shaco who is currently in Bronze and laughing my ass off because nobody knows to be afraid of me, am I going to hell?","replies":[{"poster":"aLawfulFalafel","date":"2016-03-05T16:18:24.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PLUS ONE XD\n\ni would upvote this twice if only i could lmao","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hemulen Magi","date":"2016-03-04T00:13:32.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice top lane guide.

She was anti-carry in that she could prevent her lane from getting kills on herself by playing defensive, but was still fair because of her shortcomings (lack of range, burst damage, hard cc, and being mantra-reliance). Kind of like Lulu right now but not nearly as overloaded with cc. Karma's problem was a thematic one, not because of toxicity.\n\nYorick on the other hand just point and clicks his ghouls onto the enemy laner until he's oom. That's pretty much the entirety of his playstyle in laning phase. Riot still hasn't fixed the problem with targeting his ghouls. You win on Yorick by not interacting with your lane opponent and just sending out your ghouls to chase them around and poke them out until you can straight up 1v2 them and their jungler. There's little to no counterplay so it's not interactive or interesting for the lane opponent or the yorick player, unless you're one of those people that really enjoy killing ants with a magnifying glass. It's anti-fun. He's got a good concept and the potential is there, but his kit needs a healthier playstyle before he can be receiving any buffs.","replies":[{"poster":"Envy Sin","date":"2016-03-06T00:16:44.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'll address your points as best i can though the wall of text.\n\n1. She had burst, She just had to be low hp to really pump out damage. Which in the current meta of talons zeds and so on would be godly. (Her ap is higher the lower HP she has)\n\n2. Nobody really understood her kit, This is why she got reworked in OVER A YEAR she was not put on free week once. Not a single player got to try her before buying meaning not many people did. (i was one of few)\n\n3. I don't know about many other karma players but i LOVED the 6 points system. (that's just me but hey it was unique so it got removed)\n\n4. She wasn't long range but she didn't need to be, People would poke her down then over commit ALL THE TIME, They didn't understand that the lower she was the more damage/heal/shield she could get. \n\nThe few good karmas i faced/played with (i think maybe 1-2) practically raped the other laner.\n\nNot saying yoricks kit isn't toxic (because it is) what i'm saying is he isn't seen enough for people to know how to beat him hence the \"ZOMG YORICK OP PLS NERF\" \n\nwhen really he can be beat. Much like old karma people didn't know what to expect/what to do. That was the only point i was making lol. Which is true\n\nYorick has not seen a free week in a long while, Yorick is underplayed/undervalued (honestly atm he's still pretty damn strong) and is going to get a rework because of it. Not because he needs it but because his sales are low.\n\nTLDR: Yoricks rework has nothing to do with how toxic his kit is, It's the fact that Riot can make money (increase his sales, Just like karma) with a rework.","replies":[{"poster":"SirShaggy","date":"2016-03-06T21:41:25.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My bad. I tend to get too wrapped up in thought to format.\n\n1. She had to be low HP and have mantra stacks to really do any sort of burst combo. Seems fair to me. Plus a lot of people built her offtank since she was such a supportive utility-mage.\n\n2. Agreed. But now that League has champs like Bard, Yasuo, Kindred, Tahm Kench, and other champions that require teamplay as part of their kit there's really no excuse for the changes in her kit's functionality.\n\n3. I would have enjoyed it if it was balanced around her abilities being stronger at 6 points, but it wasn't. Her abilites were innately weaker because she had to dump another level into each of them to put them on par with everyone else's abilities.\n\n4. That's not a problem with Karma herself but with people's lack of understanding her kit. She had the lowest playrate for a looong time and Riot never addressed her. She had the inherent weakness of having low range and mediocre poke when she was healthy but had plenty of safety and turn-around potential to compensate.\n\nI just don't see how old Karma was OP as shit or toxic. I think she had a very unique and interesting playstyle that both her and her lane opponent had to play around. She wasn't oppressive in lane, but a good Karma could stall out a bad matchup and hope her team either outscaled later with her teamfight utility or hope the enemy laner gets cocky and over commits without considering her Mantra and passive. Kind of like a Malphite or Lulu.\n\nYorick's playstyle is toxic because it lacks the depth and playmaking of old Karma. Karma could shut down a lane from getting kills by playing safe under tower, but Yorick shuts down a lane by spamming w on any enemy champ who gets in range to farm. It's not that people don't know how to play against him, it's that he's not a fun to lane against. He doesn't give his enemy laner opportunities for meaningful gameplay decisions. Kind of like a Teemo, except even more irritating.\n\nTLDR: Yorick's rework has everything to do with how bland and toxic his kit is. You really shouldn't compare it to old Karma's.","replies":[{"poster":"Envy Sin","date":"2016-03-07T20:42:52.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you read over it again i'm sure you'll notice i didn't say karma was toxic i pointed out the real reason for the rework with yorick which karma shared.","replies":[{"poster":"SirShaggy","date":"2016-03-08T01:47:06.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Old karma was OP as shit, Toxic as shit, Just nobody knew who she was.\"\n\nBruh.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
