They can still situationally get CDR from items like: {{item:3158}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3078}}{{item:3508}} \n\nAlso, {{item:3071}} should only give 10% CDR, but cleaves should stack up to 10 x 3% (from 6 x 4%) for a total maximum of 30% armor reduction.  Melee auto-attacks should provide 2 cleave stacks each.  This will further discourage marksmen from building BC to replace lost CDR itemization.  Marksmen/assassins will still benefit from their juggernaut/fighter allies shredding more enemy armor with BC.\n\nAlso, maybe lower {{item:3110}} to 10% CDR and buff its aura to 20% attack speed reduction.  It's a cool supportive tank item, but it seems to have become more and more rarely built as CDR has become more prevalent.  I think it's too hard to fit 20% CDR on a single item slot into a tank build nowadays.  Also, the aura size should be more visible for allies and enemies (perhaps a faint line of particles resembling the aurora borealis or snow flurries on the edge).\n\nSupports, supportive/true tanks, and maybe mages (at full build) should be the only classes reliably capping 40% CDR every game.  AP assassins should really have better access to CDR than AD assassins if they choose to build it ({{item:3100}} {{item:3152}} {{item:3157}}) since they can't fall back on autoattacks to finish a fight.  Also, AP sacrifices more to bring CDR glyphs because glyphs are AP's primary rune type.","replies":[{"poster":"BALDG1VEN BOOMER","date":"2017-08-11T18:56:02.841+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"CDR is such a free stat in this game now it's ridiculous, as a support It's come to the point where I'm over capping on CDR and I don't even care if I do.\n\nNot sure why Riot decided they'll start to stuff CDR into almost every item.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-08-11T19:19:09.986+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The game has gotten faster-paced over time, and this was apparently easier or less kludgey than simply giving everyone a free passive 20% CDR.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sdars","date":"2017-08-11T23:06:17.498+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mobility creep\n\nCC creep\n\nDamage creep\n\nCDR creep\n\nRiot is so obsessed with turning this game into dota they don't realize when it's just too much, and we've been past that point a long time ago...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kloqdq","date":"2017-08-11T19:52:50.902+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly I would like to see a lot of CDR removed from items.

However, I also feel like removing it from too many items leaves certain classes of champs without the ability to even attempt to build for cdr if they want to.\n\nMost notably, tanks and ADCs/AD bruisers struggled with being able to get more than 10 or 20% cdr, as the stat simply didn't exist on that many tank or AD items.  I think Riot went a bit overboard by adding CDR to everything, but I also think they wanted to allow more champs to get cdr easier - and allow for different paths to do so.  That being said, it feels like you can get a significant amount of cooldown just by building what you want to anyway, which doesn't feel like a good solution.","replies":[{"poster":"Hemulen Magi","date":"2017-08-11T23:00:03.053+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think we agree on most things, but I don't think every class should have equal access to CDR.  I strongly feel if marksmen or AD assassins want to hit 40% CDR, they should need to either bring scaling CDR runes or seriously shape their build around it, taking {{item:3158}}{{item:3078}}{{item:3142}} for example.  Likewise, AD juggernauts who really want CDR should need to build something like {{item:3158}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3800}} (or bring some mix of CDR runes).\n\nDon't get me wrong, I don't hate those classes.  I used to main {{champion:83}}, who is an AD juggernaut.  I don't necessarily want them to be weaker by limiting their CDR itemization.  I think the items losing CDR should be given moderate compensation buffs in most cases, which would leave the classes using them balanced around the assumption that they'll not have capped CDR or will be making significant sacrifices by limiting their build in order to obtain CDR.  \n\nThe point I think we agree on is that we should need to situationally and consciously decide to focus on CDR if we want to get it.  I think we disagree on whether that should be equally true for every class and champion.  While every class can benefit from CDR if it's freely available without sacrifice, that takes away planning and cheapens the stat.  Similarly, defensive stats like health and armor are also useful on every class of champions, but they should and are more easily itemized on specific classes which those as their primary stats, ie., tanks and juggernauts who need defenses to fulfill their front-line role.\n\nClasses which rely on their utility or CC in order to bring value feel like the most fitting CDR users because they are generally of very limited use while their abilities are on cooldown.  Classes like marksmen and skirmishers with autoattack buffs feel like the least fitting users of CDR because they can still fight while their abilities are on cooldown, so they never feel truly powerless or ability reliant.  Assassins also don't seem to fit well with CDR because they need significant cooldowns or else they become oppressive, since they should be punishable if they fail an assassination attempt, or at a minimum they should need to wait a decent window before making another attempt.  AD assassins should have their CDR more limited than AP assassins on account of all AD assassins having strong autoattacks as a fall-back plan to finish off a target while abilities are on cooldown.\n\nIn my mind, there are three primary CDR classes which should have an easier time accessing CDR: Utility supports > Supportive/true tanks > Mages.\n\nI see Utility supports as the prime user of CDR, and they fittingly have the easiest time building the stat thanks to items like: {{item:3069}} {{item:3107}} {{item:3504}} {{item:3174}} {{item:3222}}\n\nUtility/CC tanks can also conveniently pick up CDR items, which is fitting: {{item:2303}} {{item:3025}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3109}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3800}}\nBut if anything, it's getting frustrating to avoid over-capping 40% CDR as a tank, which is why I suggest removing CDR on {{item:3083}} {{item:3194}} and lowering CDR on {{item:3110}} in exchange for other buffs.\n\nMages actually have fairly limited CDR itemization, but I feel it's okay since they are still valued targets when their abilities are down.  They still do have 3 solid items they can build for 40% CDR: {{item:3165}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3102}} \n\nLike I've said before, other classes should still be able to get CDR, but it should be by meaningfully sacrificing other options, like by giving up magic resistance glyphs or by choosing {{item:3158}} or pouring gold into {{item:3078}} for examples.  One particular item that I currently dislike is {{item:3508}} because it literally seems like an item that says \"hey, marksmen, want a ton of CDR tacked onto your regular crit build?\"  It doesn't necessarily seem overpowered, just a poor idea for an item.  I think it should keep 10% CDR and get a different passive.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hemulen Magi","date":"2017-08-11T23:31:51.018+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ugh.

Since it's become so convenient for Riven to reach 40% CDR once she's already snowballing, the windows to fight back against her have shrunk considerably in worst case scenarios, leaving bad matchups against her even worse.  Would you consider that it might be healthier if she weren't balanced around easily capping CDR, perhaps in exchange for better options versus her hard counters?  Riven is a popular champion with a devoted playerbase.  Riot wouldn't leave her unviable if reducing AD fighter CDR itemization disproportionately hurt her winrates across the board.  For the most part, less plentiful CDR itemization should create decision making.  You could take scaling CDR runes to be less of a lane bully in exchange for a stronger lategame and still cap CDR for example.  If your matchup allows you to get boots of Lucidity, then that would be another option.  Building Youmoo's would be a third option.  Building Warrior's Machete in her jungle off-role would also provide CDR.  I don't think that Riven or other AD fighters should necessarily reliably reach 40% CDR in their standard build though.  They can be balanced around getting other strengths in their standard builds.  I didn't suggest specific buffs for {{item:3812}} {{item:3156}} but you can feel free to suggest what they would need in exchange for losing CDR.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Cant Hold Me Now,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=59g2WA9z,comment-id=000a00000000,timestamp=2017-08-12T00:48:38.034+0000)\n>\n> Think again.

When a true tank goes into a solo lane, they must build in a way that makes them somewhat self-sufficient, so in a solo lane environment, {{item:3025}} is a real tank item (often combined with {{item:3068}}) even though other non-tanks, like Ezreal, will sometimes use it.  Solo laning tanks are the primary users that the item is designed for, and it happens to fill a lot of the CDR cap.  After laning, a top lane tank can also get CDR from supportive tank items {{item:3800}} {{item:3109}} if they want since they'll be filling a supportive role in teamfighting anyways.  If they want to forsake CDR for pure tank stats (probably a bad idea in most cases) then they don't need to get 40% CDR in their build, but it wouldn't be too difficult if they want to build CDR.  If you think about it, it's really quite difficult not to overcap CDR as a tank even in top lane.  If you get {{item:3025}}{{item:3068}}  to help with laning, then you decide you want to get {{item:3083}} {{item:3065}} (these two items often go together) then you're already at 40% CDR, which discourages picking up {{item:3800}} for example even though your team might need the help engaging.  By putting CDR on every item, it actually limits freedom in building.  We should need to plan to get capped CDR if we choose to build for it.\n\nFor {{item:3110}}, I am primarily considering bot-lane-support tanks since top-laners often prefer {{item:3025}} for the reasons outlined above.  As a bot-lane support tank, it is really very difficult to avoid overcapping CDR, considering {{item:2303}} {{item:3107}} is already 20% CDR, so if you don't want to overcap then you can't pick {{item:3110}} with any other items which contain CDR even though there are so many options that a tanky support might want ({{item:3109}} {{item:3800}} {{item:3065}}  {{item:3050}} {{item:3060}} to name just a few).  If {{item:3110}} gave only 10% CDR in exchange for compensation buffs, then players could buy it and still pick a fourth item containing CDR without overcapping.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Cant Hold Me Now,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=59g2WA9z,comment-id=000a00000000,timestamp=2017-08-12T00:48:38.034+0000)\n>\n> Erh, do people even build Warmogs?

The 10% CDR on it isn't always welcome in a build, especially as an item that is usually built when already near full build.  I think that it should lose the generic CDR and likely have its prices increased in exchange for either more of the core stat people want to build it for (lategame fantasy of crazy health stacking, ie. tank equivalent to {{item:3031}} {{item:3089}}) or some new actual unique strength to make it stand out.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2017-08-11T21:06:47.484+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"{{item:3071}} Because gutting bruisers is a good idea?

In any case, even if BC became slightly weaker (and I don't think it would, except maybe as a rush item), that wouldn't \"gut\" bruisers as you claimed.  You are clearly exaggerating and have taken up a needlessly belligerent stance.  Bruisers don't need to rush BC as their first item, especially if their opponent isn't stacking armor.  And you don't need to resort to personal attacks, calling people idiots on the boards.\n\nYou need to keep in mind that there are other CDR options for bruisers as well.  You can take 10% CDR runes, {{item:3078}}, {{item:3065}}, and that's capped 40% CDR right there. Bruisers shouldn't even necessarily have an easy time capping CDR.

Adaptive Helm could receive increased MR for example.]\n\nNo more Haste passive on {{item:3802}} or items built from it.\n\n{{item:3070}} gives 5% CDR.  Items built from Tear of the Goddess grant stats from both mana and over-capped CDR (replacing Transcendence rune).\n\n{{item:3110}} builds out of {{item:3070}} + {{item:3024}} + {{item:3082}} and transforms into an upgraded version when Awe is fully stacked.  Awe grants bonus health.  The upgraded version has a stronger, ramping-up aura which can be toggled on, costing mana each second.\n\n{{item:3004}} builds out of {{item:3070}} + {{item:3101}}, gaining its Shock passive (reduced to 1.5% mana on-hit) before upgrading to {{item:3042}} (allowing the full 3% mana on-hit after upgrade).  Because it would no longer build from {{item:1037}}, it would provide less AD, and the recipe change would make it somewhat more expensive.  Manamune would offer a way for mana-gated AD champions to continue building CDR, while resourceless AD champions would have considerably less access to CDR than before.  CDR capping doesn't need to be a super common thing for every champion class, and compensating some items with other strengths, like increased defensive stats, could help improve the game pace.\n\nTranscendence rune is removed (now part of Awe passive) and it is replaced by a Spell Weaving or Expose Weakness rune (just give it a 'Sorcery' sounding name, like Blighting Curse, and give it synergy with DOT and AOE).\n\nAlso if Magic Resistance is increased on many items to compensate for reduced CDR on them, there will be room for a new Sorcery keystone tailored to DPS APCs.  Deathfire Touch can make a return as a rune that reduces immediate ability damage dealt in exchange for a larger amount of delayed damage over time.  This will allow players to give up instant burst potential in order to deal DOT DPS.  For example, the keystone could convert 30% of damage that would be dealt by abilities into a burn over 4 seconds that deals 55% of the original ability damage.  This would result in the ability doing 125% in total but spread out over a longer period.  Squishy targets would normally die within 4 seconds of fighting, so this mostly impacts fighting frontliners, hence why this addition to the game would fit with increased availability of Magic Resistance on frontliner items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrDubb","date":"2019-09-24T07:22:58.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally find it frustrating to have so much CDR from an itemization perspective. I'm a  mid main, and I wont even go into how efficient LUDENS ECHO is and how it's the Black Cleaver of mid lane... if you're a burst mage you ALWAYS build it first no matter what because it gives you EVERYTHING a mage needs unlike any other item (extra scaling burst dmg, wave clear, 20%CDR, mana item, HIGH AP) Damn, I said this wasn't about Luden's Echo ( or Black Cleaver...)\n\nAnyways. It's DIFFICULT to not have a build that goes over 40% CDR. It's a crappy feeling every game.  Absolute Focus being weaker recently, and 10% CDR in the rune stats, compounds the situation. Although I often take Absolute Focus over Transcendence, I can't see myself trading 10% CDR for 9AP...\nLudens ECHO plus the 10% CDR from runes is already 30%, so pick your 10% item carefully.  Zhonyas?  Banshees? Hextech item? Twin Shadows? Lich Bane?Maybe you're a AP bruiser who wants Spirit Visage. I find it ridiculous an optimal build can't have more than one these item's and Luden's together.\nAfter boots, your other 3 items HAVE to be Void Staff, Rabadons, Liandries, Rylais, Morrelonomicon, or Mejais.\n\nMaybe you're playing ARAM and want some weird itemization but often can't because it's ALWAYS over 40% CDR. \nTanks have it EVEN WORSE. Pretty much CAN'T build Black Cleaver and Frozen Gauntlet together, because your MR item will put you over the cap. And I don't think you're running Transcendence as a tank, so you dont even have the chance to benefit from the extra adaptive force. \n\nOverall... ALL the CDR feels bad.\n\nP.S. Why are Ionian Boots even an item even more? If it wasn't for the summoner spell buff, they'd be COMPLETELY obsolete. Even the traditional support characters that would RUSH these boots don't because of excess CDR in every item. They're just better off with literally any other item. (Sorcerer boots for brand lux ect. Even tank boots are better than ionian boots for beefier supports.
