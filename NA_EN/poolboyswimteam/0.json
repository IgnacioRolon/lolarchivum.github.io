Whenever I'm in game I'm not able to move the mouse outside the screen, so I can't click and drag the borders. Even if I do manage to get out, I'm still not able to. I've tried windowed mode on every resolution. Is there a way to resize the client?\nEDIT: I use a mac and an extra screen if that helps","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-06T18:41:04.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you try using League in Fullscreen or Borderless mode and set your extra screen as your [primary display](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202351)?\n\nLet me know if either resolved this.","replies":[]}]}
