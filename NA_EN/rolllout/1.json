This temp animation may have been picked up during an early PBE cycle, which is why it's showing up on LoLKing. It's intended that this animation is not being called for Spirit Guard Udyr.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Skelenth","date":"2015-10-19T14:49:56.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Caiptain Obvious here: It is probably, as the name says, a idle animation in the brush.
