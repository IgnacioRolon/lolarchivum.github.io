It keeps saying that it's Authenticating and after about a minute it says there was an unexpected error logging in.\n\nCase 2:\nI want to login with the new client. After a while instead of throwing an error, it logs me into my account but when I click for example \"Play\" then at first nothing happens. After a brief period it opens the Play menu and instantly gives me a \"Trying to reconnect\" screen.\n(Note: The connection to the chat server works completely fine)\n\nCase 3: \nI want to login with the legacy client. After the login creds are authenticated it says \"Logging on..\" for a while and then also throws an error.\n\n\n\nThis is a very weird issue because after hours of bruteforcing my way into the client it suddenly works and is completely stable without any problems until I close it. \nOften I'm changing network settings on my desktop computer (changing DNS, Firewall, renew connection, etc) with no immediate effect\nIt just suddenly works after a while, however the time spent trying to log in is still frustrating","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-21T19:27:40.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like more like a network problem than PC that's having problems connecting to a few of our servers including authentication.
