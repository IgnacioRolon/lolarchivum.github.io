Lissandra is my main mid champion! I love the damage her Q has and nerfing makes me really upset. Of all the champions you could've nerfed, you choose her?! Why not Zed, or Katarina, or even Yasuo?! You could've at least extended her range on Q to make up for lost damage, I would take that better than just nerfing her damage and still having a short ranged Q. I really am not happy now.","replies":[{"poster":"calforrai","date":"2015-03-12T20:06:31.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was against the change when i aw it on PBE at first.\nbut the nerf is very very minor to be honest, it's just 25 damage off of max rank Q","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tavish","date":"2015-03-12T19:01:19.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could understand complaining about Zed or Kat, but for god sakes please no more yasuo nerfs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sirsir","date":"2015-03-12T18:40:42.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't let a tiny liss nerf make me hate one of the best patches in awhile.

Her mobility and crowd control are the same and thats what makes her destroy Top Lane combined with her being Ranged.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WolfChases","date":"2015-03-12T18:39:01.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand that you want Katarina or Zed to get nerfed but why the hell would they nerf Yasuo?????\n\nBtw they nerfed Lissandra for the same reason they will probably nerf Zed. \n\n- Insane damage\n- Safe laning phase\n\nNot to mention that she has AOE and SINGLE target CC and inbuilt ZHONYAS and 1 good ultimate can change the teamfight so she doesen't need abnormal damage to be viable in this meta.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-03-12T18:37:45.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why nerf sion?","replies":[]},{"poster":"D rok","date":"2015-03-12T18:21:40.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get that Lissandra was a pain in top lane lately, but I think she will naturally thrive in a meta where assassins tend toward dominance.  I'm surprised that they nerfed her base values so hard though, and that there's been so little talk about it.  It's a really substantial nerf to her early and mid game.  She relies heavily on her base values, and her Q still isn't nearly as powerful a harass tool as some of the dominant picks right now.\n\nI guess that they just don't want her TOO strong at kiting top laners?  I dunno.  I don't get it either, really.","replies":[]}]}
