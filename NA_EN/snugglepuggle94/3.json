He basically has never ending mines until he runs out of mana, and it makes those who are melee not able to farm. That is not fair.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-05-06T20:04:02.422+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"no","replies":[{"poster":"SnugglePuggle94","date":"2015-05-06T20:04:31.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I say yes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ipols","date":"2015-05-06T20:29:44.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He isn't overpowered and he can't deny farm while poking and farming himself. Did you try to play poppy mid or what? He's not a lane bully and has no kill potatial. learn to bait a Q before last hitting or to just dodge them.\nLate game he's really strong but that's not what we are talking about here","replies":[{"poster":"SnugglePuggle94","date":"2015-05-06T23:53:44.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was playing Diana, and yea it was hard trying to dodge them, cause each time I moved he would put one close or right where I was moving too, and every time I tried to come in to take a creep he would hit me. I was so behind in creeps but was able to kill him after post 6 but really its not fair to be unable to farm, which means not be able to get much money to buy items.","replies":[]}]}]}
