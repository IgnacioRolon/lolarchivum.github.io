First, you needed to acknowledge the leaver buster system warning. You then had to show a pattern of leaving that would give you a 5 minute leaver penalty. You then had to escalate beyond that to a 10 minute penalty.\n\nIf all of this is caused by your wifi router, I would suggest you try to resolve the problem before playing any more games. As the previous poster stated, there are 9 other people that were affected by you disconnecting. I understand your situation can be frustrating, but realize how frustrating it is for others as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Korillo","date":"2015-12-17T18:53:45.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Tantram,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=OxQhdM8T,comment-id=000000000002,timestamp=2015-12-17T18:32:14.574+0000)\n>\n> To arrive at a 10 minute punishment a few things needed to happen.

Like seriously wifi is not good for gaming. \n\nWifi uses a protocol like TCP IP to verify packets are not being lost from your machine to the router. Then it will decrypt them to and then send them out as UDP cause TCP IP is horrible for gaming. If you lose a packet from computer to router (AND YOU WILL A LOT OF THEM) the computer is requested to resend the now junk data that is being thrown away. That is not to mention the fact that the wireless part of your router almost another machine and can have errors that do not effect the routing it self. \n\nRiot has stated wifi is not the optimal setup and should not be used if their is a choice. Also if your internet goes out you would still get punishments anyways(if a constant problem). It is your choice to play on a sub standard system / set up. \n\nSo yes you deserve what you got.","replies":[{"poster":"Oblivion1276","date":"2015-12-17T06:56:20.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not too mention if you around other routers, or in an apartment building, your signal would be affected by the other services that other people are using.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OnlyLemonaids","date":"2015-12-17T04:37:48.213+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I have to sit for 10 minutes before every game now.

I highly suggest you switch to Ethernet instead of Wifi, and this would give you a more stable connection.","replies":[]}]}]}
