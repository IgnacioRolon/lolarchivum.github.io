However for the past couple of days, whenever I've tried to choose rune page 11 or 12 they seem to glitch out. I'm not sure if they're merged or something but I am unable to edit or choose them. The biggest problem this causes is that in champ select whenever I try to choose rune page 11 or up, it doesn't save. I can't choose any of my rune pages after page 11. I'm not sure what's going on because my pages were working fine before this most recent patch. I'm not sure if it is the patch or my client. I've attempted to do a clean install of the client and it is still glitched, so I assume it's nothing on my end that's causing it. If Riot could please just reset all my pages, I think that would fix it however I'm not sure.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-13T20:27:06.257+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is something we're currently looking into, but might be able to resolve through a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
