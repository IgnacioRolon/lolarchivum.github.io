A few requirements I'd ask:\n#1 - you're available for all the bracket windows to play\n#2 - I'm in silver so ideally you're around that elo XD. I've played up before, but would prefer to avoid it\n#3 - We are playing for similar reasons. I'm playing to have fun, meet cool people, and learn and hopefully win some cool stuff. I'm not interested in being the next Faker, or people who are mad that they aren't playing with the next Faker :). \n\nRespond with your role / interest and I'll randomly select ppl to join the team! See y'all in game!\n\nEdit: Dates! \nTeam creation is Monday 8/19 - Friday 8/23. \nGames: 6pm OR 8pm PST Saturday 8/24 &amp; Sunday 8/25 (I plan on playing both)\n\nEdit Edit: I'll randomly select 4 ppl from this thread late tonight / tomorrow and close this thread so people can know if they need to find new teams :)\n\nEdit edit edit: people have been selected via a random picker tool. Thank you everyone for your interest! Really excited to play Clash! Hopefully I see y'all on the rift :). \n\nPeople who were blessed by the RNG gods.
