(calling tank supp mains)","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"I&#039;ve played {{champion:59}} since God knows when and I love that champion to death. \n\nRecently, in light of all the tank support items and stoneborn pact, I&#039;ve been trying {{champion:59}} support and it honestly feels pretty strong despite the weaker lv1 fight compared to other tank supports. His synergy with support items are just frigging amazing.\n\nLet&#039;s first look at the kit.\nHis passive \nAllows for extra easy procs of relic shield and decent trades without building damage.\n\nHis q\nshreds armor which is a direct buff to his and the adc&#039;s damage. Enables his combo which is the main form of cc\n\nHis w\nGod with the buff a few patches back, he scales amazingly with health. This also procs stone born pact constantly every few seconds and with a gargoyle Stoneplate and a locket, the Shields and heals and get pretty crazy.\n\nThe e\nAS buff which is another buff to non caster adc&#039;s. Enables his combo\n\nHis ultimate\nProbably one of the best things about him playing support. Enemies often underestimate the effectiveness of the wall in terms of peel and the nuke is also pretty good. This is frigging amazing if played with mf or jhin. Also helps junglers with long distance engages.\n\nItem synergies\nAs j4 support, what you wan is mainly health and Shields to take advantage of your w, stoneborn pact and just inflicting buffs,debuffs and sticking like a flag in your enemies backs.\n\n{{item:3109}}\nHas absolutely everything j4 wants. Cdr, health, and the ability to stay near your adc, shielding away the damage they take.\n\n{{item:3190}} \nBy building health, locket in conjunction with your w and stone born part&#039;s bonus health, your Shields will just be massive\n\n{{item:3193}} \nThis is a must. Holy shit. This item just makes all of j4 supports aspects stronger. Stronger heal on stoneborn, strong w stronger everything\n\n{{item:3050}} \nNow this is a new one. I&#039;ve tried this with join and so far it&#039;s pretty decent. Not too set on it yet cuz it feels a bit weak. The passive plus his ultimate basically ensures that everyone gets ignited. But personally I prefer to use locket over this.\n\n{{item:3071}} \nNot exactly  a support item but it helps with armor shred. Enchanter ish and MOAR CDR\n\n{{item:3068}} \nEdited in: totally forgot about this. This one is just a j4 thing. Its frigging amazing due to his r trapping people with you in your sunfire cape range and just having decent tank stats in general. This in conjunction with zeke's convergence also makes you this sort of passive aoe damage storm. However, the trade off is less support items.\n\nPlaystyle \nSo far from the games I&#039;ve experimented with, you basically play as a tank support buff bot. Massive Shields and armor shreds plus AS buffs, constant knock ups with the soft cc on the ultimate and pretty decent roam potential. \nHowever his early game seems a tad bit weaker than other tank supports due to him requiring scaling to truly succeed.\n(also, i add 3 points in e followed by r>w>e>q for bigger shields and shorter cooldowns on e. the cool down on e is slightly longer than that of q. adding e brings the gap closer.)\n\nEdit: Pointers from discussions so far\n\nBasically, there are supports who do similar things (namely: {{champion:89}} {{champion:12}} {{champion:111}} )\nDefensive steroid in lane not up to par with tank supports\nmechanically more demanding compared to above mentioned supports.\n\nAll in all, he seems like a decent support.

Don't expect he'd really fit as a meta pick, as theres plenty of other tank supports that offer more lockdown potential.\n\nWould have concerns with his ability to peel, particularly if you fall behind at all, since his cc involves gap closing through enemies, which is prone to leaving you in a bad spot.

Even the aforementioned nunu has more base damage on his Q (which also slows and slows AS too).\n\nArmour shred is neat and all, but it's % shred, which isn't really that potent against squishy targets (such as the enemy adc) compared to flat pen, and also only lasts 3 seconds, which in early game will only amount to 2-3 autos that benefit. \n\nYou're also not going to be able to reap all the potential benefits of the kit at the same time. If you're using your flag for the AS proactively, then it's not going to be useful for an eq gapclose (assuming enemy don't position poorly), and similarly if you're trading with q it could be on cd when you want it.\n\nIt's unclear what you want to be maxing as j4 support too, as all of them do enhanced support-y things when leveled, when plenty of other supports get almost their full benefit even at rank 1.\n\nAlso, all of those features are offensive perks, which is all well and good if you happen to be winning lane, but if you're behind, then you're kinda useless. I'd think you(/your duo partner) would be pretty susceptible to ganks too, so if the enemy jungler agrees, then you could be in for a rough time.\n\nLike I said though, I could see it working better than plenty of other off-meta supports since all his abilities do have something support-y to offer, but I just don't see it being as effective as more conventional picks","replies":[{"poster":"Need Gold 4 Tent","date":"2017-07-21T06:30:57.580+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is up to the user how to use the kit.

You can't miss a J4 ult, so it is guaranteed to burn an escape. granted, it is not a 100% lock as it is not exactly a CC but it works loosely like a root in a way for any aoe based adc like mf to unload their entire kits on the enemy. Compared to Naut, he has more mobility to get to the enemy he needs and a more reliable way too (his EQ passes through minions and his R is targetted). However, he does lack in \"hard\" CC although his ult is arguably a kind of CC too.\n\nWhat J4 really has over Naut though, is damage coming from his base values and more damage in the form of armor debuffing and the AS buff for his ADC.

He certainly has more damage than those two but hes got unreliable CC so its a risk. He doesnt have any tools to protect his ADC which is what every support wants these days, you know to make your ADC a Kill god and never die.  I won't deny he is fun as hell as support, and your right he does well at what he wants to do, but other champions are just better at keeping their ADC in the game. That being said I think I might try him with Frozen Mallet as I've done with Shen support and see if that is good enough for peel as well.","replies":[{"poster":"JarPoop IV","date":"2017-07-21T16:17:14.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea. totally understand he is not the best at protecting the ADC like braum or tahm. Engage being not as good as leona, i would beg to differ. \nHis r is the only cc which is unreliable due to it being buggy as shit(riot please. fix this. its been years). \nThe w is plenty slow and the eq is pretty solid engage if played well. I guess the main issue is mechanically, playing j4 supp demands alot more than a simpler support who does the job equally well.\n\n(huh, i haven't thought of frozen mallet cause of the price. shuld try that too)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AmetDeCrypt","date":"2017-07-21T03:54:19.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"same reason people don't play fiora support\n\nthey work, but they are somewhat item dependant, and their kits center around locking one person down leaving them somewhat unable to get back to their carries should they need sudden peel. it'd be mostly a kill centered lane so if you bring along an ad who knows what they're doing go nuts, but soloq support they don't quite keep up with the rest.","replies":[]}]}
