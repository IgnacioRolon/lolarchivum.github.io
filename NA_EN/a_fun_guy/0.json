The 4th auto doesnt do extra damage or the correct animation of the 4th smack. \nIf that was hard to understand ill put it like this \n\nNormal: [W Active] auto auto auto SMACK  \n    \nWhat ive seen happen: [W active] auto (level up W) auto auto auto (no SMACK in this one) . \n\nI Feel like this is due to how things were changed with singed and a couple of other champs in the past patches were if you level up singeds poision while its ticking it will now instantly do the new value of damage. I Feel like thats happening here with kled. You have the W active and you level it up, so it starts from the beginning of the ability rather than just picking up where it left off. Anyways hope this helps you guys. {{champion:240}} {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"ProtestantCaesar","date":"2017-06-15T16:46:49.536+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be clear, whenever you said \"auto\", you mean that it used the Violent Tendencies stabbing animation like the first three auto attacks usually do, right?\nIt wasn't using his regular, non-W auto attack animations, was it?","replies":[{"poster":"A Fun Guy","date":"2017-06-15T17:26:59.895+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah the sped up W autos where kled stabs from the top","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2017-06-16T21:52:45.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@P Royy This bug may have also appeared due to the change to W with his plants.
