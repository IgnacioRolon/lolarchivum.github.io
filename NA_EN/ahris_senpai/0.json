Then 15-20 seconds later everything goes back to normal but it doesnt end after 1 dc it does it 15 -20 fricking times and its just out right annoying as hell. Ive lost 3 ranked games where this has happened, and i get flamed by my team because of it and I even got a 20 min low priority queue ban for it. Can someone please help me fix this. I am most certain that its not my internet because i am able to use youtube while playing league  and even checked if it was the wifi was was crashing on my phone but it never happens unless im mid game. Also this started happening when i upgraded my computer to windows 10. I have also reinstalled league several times! ive run out of options SO PLEASE HELP ME!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-07T16:03:23.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even though you can access Youtube or other sites, your network can still have problems reaching specific servers.
