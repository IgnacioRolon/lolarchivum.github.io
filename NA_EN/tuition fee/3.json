That means that you should work together with your team to increase your chances of victory!\n\nIf the enemy jungler is invading a couple of things are happening that perhaps you haven't realized.\n\n1.) If your jungler is a worse duelist compared to the enemy jungler then your junglers options are A.) Give the enemy jungler a kill plus your team's jungle farm or B.) Give the enemy jungler your teams jungle farm. Neither of these options are good as both of them put your jungler as a disadvantage making their overall impact on ALL of your lanes worse (under levelled, under farmed). \n\n2.) The enemy jungler is far away from the safety of their team and towers. If the enemy jungler is invading, that means that your team should reliably be able to collapse on them and get a kill. At the very least it will put the enemy jungler behind because they then wasted a lot of time going into your jungle and coming out of it with nothing. If your team does get a kill, regardless of who gets it, this gives your team an advantage! 300 bonus gold closer to their next item.\n\nThis should make it very easy to see which options is better. For the overall good of your team, it's much preferable to lose a few cs and help out your jungler, than to let them rot and suffer. The further behind they get, the easier it is for the enemy jungler to keep invading, pushing your jungler further and further behind, and the less overall impact your jungler has in ganks or on the game itself.","replies":[{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2019-03-27T01:06:40.380+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":23,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Watafool,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EGAHMEbn,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2019-03-27T00:57:43.209+0000)\n>\n> I'm not sure if you know this, but League of Legends is a team based game.

Jarvan 4 and Lee sin I'm talking about you. Champs that if left to their own devices in skilled hands will eat just about any jungle other than Jax( I hate Jax) you as a laser absolutely have to stop them from invading and killing your jungle and then free farming their jungle farm. I can't tell you how many lvl 2 kills I get on the enemy when they are going for their blue or red buff, then after that I just farm their farm and kill them, if the laners don't come to stop me early on then I'll be fed enough that they can't mess with me either. Then I will always have a free farm on their jungle, I'll keep deep wards in their bushes, have the pressure to more or less safely gank any lane, take objectives et. Then the hard lane ganks and quick snowball hits. Especially if we're talking in lower elo where warding isn't the best.\n\nOn the games where I'm getting hard pressured from the opposing jungle,  like if they have a stupid Good Lee sin, if you come roam down for me, give me some push back and maybe a kill or at least enough pressure he can't free farm my jungle. I as a jungle will be appreciative and make sure to gank for you and try and feed you. \n \nAbout 80% of my games that I win jungle hard and shut down the opposing jungle my team wins. And almost every game if I get shutdown hard and get no help or pushback from the team we lose.\n\nGranted there's the games where neither jungle snow balls, but it almost a guaranteed loss if your jg is shut down hard at lower elo","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AlexisTheDragon","date":"2019-04-17T22:38:22.391+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tuition Fee,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EGAHMEbn,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-03-27T00:25:34.230+0000)\n>\n> I don't play JG...\n\nWow...match history, you really don't.\n\nRespect for the truth.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2019-03-27T04:00:34.968+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jamaree,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EGAHMEbn,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-03-27T00:23:00.389+0000)\n>\n> Oh boo hoo, your lives are so hard, it isn’t like other roles don’t have hardships either, get over yourselves.\n\nAs a fellow top laner, you of all people should understand why role targeted nerfs are an issue...","replies":[{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2019-03-27T04:06:07.846+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":12,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AngusBoomPants,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EGAHMEbn,comment-id=00000002,timestamp=2019-03-27T04:00:34.968+0000)\n>\n> As a fellow top laner, you of all people should understand why role targeted nerfs are an issue...\n\nIt isn't anywhere near as bad as they are making it out to be though, let's be honest here.","replies":[{"poster":"Nnaruruloki","date":"2019-03-27T05:34:33.934+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"But it is as bad as we are making it out to be.

Whichever lane has the better setup. Only get a kill 25-50% of the time but at least get 1 summoner spell or better basically Everytime on those early ganks. Long as you don't over commit and just hit them with a decent combo like j4 eqw and an auto it's a good half their health plus a summoner, gives your lane great early pressure and cost you just some seconds and some mana.
