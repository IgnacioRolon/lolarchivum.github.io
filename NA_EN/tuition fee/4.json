So you still buy a control ward, it replaces your current selection of the ward, and the amount of control wards stack. So when you use up all of the control wards that you bought, then you get the ward that you had before you bought the control.\n\nIf riot put this in then they would have to make it so that your current ward is still under cd while you hold the control ward, otherwise you can use up all of your regular wards, go to base and buy control ward, come back to lane plop down the control ward and then you instantly have a ward.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-06-21T21:59:19.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has been asked for since forever.
