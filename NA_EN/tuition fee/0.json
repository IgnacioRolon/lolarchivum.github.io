Got the bleeding under control, but he kept trembling.\r\nIt&#039;s pretty cold in my house, and he needed warmth. (Budgies use up a lot of their energy to keep warm, so artificial sources for heat greatly help in their recovery)\r\nProblem is, according to some websites, budgies need temperatures of at least around 85 degrees fahrenheit for recovery.\r\nInitially, I had no idea what to do, due to me not having anything to warm him up with, until I took him upstairs and saw my Mac. I turned it on and opened League. Computer overheated as usual, except I didn&#039;t mind it this time. The temperature must&#039;ve been nice, since he hopped onto my computer and took a snooze after I sandwiched him between two tissues. \r\n\r\nAdagio recovering:https://imgur.com/a/ZzrWWlv","replies":[]}
