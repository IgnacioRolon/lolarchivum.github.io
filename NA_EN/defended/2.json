So when it bounces to a new target you get the Q damage and the love tap damage at the same time, showed side by side.","replies":[{"poster":"Defended","date":"2016-06-08T16:55:39.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mistress Shyvana,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=LoTzQKpI,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2016-06-08T07:58:56.175+0000)\n>\n> IT doesn&#x27;t look like anyone answered your question.\n> {{champion:21}}  passive is Love tap, it does bonus damage the first time you attack something and it shows up as a second tick of damage and it crits with the original damage.\n> \n> Her Q applies love tap.
