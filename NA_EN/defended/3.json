That's fucking ridiculous.\nIf I sit on top of enemy minions as blitz, they get 0 cs ever. Cause they wont come anywhere near me. \nI don't even have to land a Q, I just have to not use Q and they wont come near me.\nWhat other champion is a threat by not using skill?\nBlitz doesnt HAVE to lead Q.

The server interprets this and correlates with the information from your side of the server and tells Blitz whether he hit you or not. HOWEVER, something that is particularly egregious with Blitz hooks (everyone has experienced it before though) is when one or both parties is lagging, there can be a visual discrepancy - it seems the ability didn't hit you but it did. This most often happens when Blitz grabs you in the last couple starting frames of a dash, jump, or blink - you appear to blink and then get pulled anyway. This is caused by both you and your opponent having ping differences to the server (and why you rarely see that kind of thing happen on the LCS stage, where the ping discrepancy is less than 10ms).\n\nSo basically you, or Blitz, or both, were probably lagging right at the second when this hook was thrown. It could only be 100~200ms, but if you're both lagging or any packet loss occurs it's still possible.
