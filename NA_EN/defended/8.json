But Azir is weak to flanking, due to the reposition placing **all** of his soldiers in one place. Even if he could have them be in different spots regularly, he can only attack with one at a time.\n\nhttp://grabilla.com/0661a-46d84d17-d8f1-43c5-897f-634d76dbfb26.png\n\nDon't just sit there and do the same thing every time, even when it is failing you.
