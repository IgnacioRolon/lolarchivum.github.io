It doesn't do anything other than knock back a ridiculously small amount (less than vel'koz) and create impassable terrain that massively slows.\n\n> In Frozen Domain, {{champion:48}} becomes incredibly strong and such, a small window of opportunity existing against him before it comes up is necessary for game health. Give him a **small stun** on E knockup, allow his pillar to block more defined areas or increase the duration of his R.\n\nThe stun really wouldn't matter much because if you're able to land the \"knock back\", then they were in the perfect center of your cast, which means that they are now directly behind your wall. That is the perfect place you'd want an enemy. What would the mini stun do? I think throwing ridiculous short cc on already short cc isn't necessary.","replies":[{"poster":"CubedJustice","date":"2015-04-22T15:52:50.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OP phrased poorly.
