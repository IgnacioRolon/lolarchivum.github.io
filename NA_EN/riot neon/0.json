For example, the Kha'Zix changes a few patches ago. There were a lot of people complaining he had been gutted. A video highlighting his new weaknesses, and corresponding new strengths, I think would have gone a long way towards demonstrating to players that he can still do well.\n\n> b) Put a face to the design team, hear deeper context behind the changes we make and get a real deep-dive on our philosophy\n\nI feel like the \"faces\" part can be done in the rest of the forecast, and that Dev blogs are a better place for the rest of it.

I was playing him a lot as a main champion.. I was enjoying it and founding that he's so op early game.. but the probleme, is that he needs more utility for jungling, his spells are giving him more top/mid opness, than jungle, when I found that kha should be fixed at one specific lane, and it's the jungle.. for example he does a lot of dmg with q wich should be nerfed a little bit because he's jungler and he needs cc+utility instead of all that dmg wich makes him better at mid/top.. so let's say , he was ok, but abused opness as a jungler.. here we have to nerf him, right, I like the decision u took trying to nerf him I'm fine about that , but I don't like the way u nerfed him.. so I will just tell you about my opinion, about what we have to change at kha'zix trying to nerf him + making him more specific jungler champion than mid or top.. there we go:\n        1) I found that instead of inscreasing the Isolation radius from 350 to 500 units .. better to redius it from 350 to 300, and the point of that is to make the enemy mid laner for exemple when he gets ganked by kha'zix , he have to use his brain and his skills , and try to walk away near minions or near his tower instead of a little away from his tower, to not get isolated and take a lot of dmg...\n        2) reducing his ulti cd a little bit to give him more utility because 100secend is really too much, and add a new buff when using the R of kha'zix wich makes each stealth cast gives you in addition of the mov.speed buff, another buff wich increase tinacity(resitance to all cc)by 20-60% when stealth so u can use it to get away from hard slows/to avoid the enemy cc's when u gank him like nocturne's shield/also giving him more utility at jungling..\n        3) You can also make his passive slow and his W spell slow more strong adding about +20% to each one, wich helps kha'zix being sepecificly jung more than top/mid and gives him more opness at his ganks before lvl 6..\n        4) You can nerf his Q's dmg , it's fine because , the q is really Op and it's being the most important spell of kha wich reduis the importance of other spells, so better nerf its dmg for exemple from  70/95/120/145/170 to 50/70/100/125/150, but in the same time, giving it an additional damage depending the missing health of the target , for exemple (50/70/100/125/150 + 4%/4%/4%/4% of enemy missing health max 200 vs monstres + a ratio of +1.2 bonus attack damage)\nSo this helps him a lot at being more specific jungler champion than top/mid and gives him more jungling opness , and in the same time more top/mid weakness and also to make this spell importance not so high making all his spells (Q,W,E) getting the same importance and opness and also to oblige kha'zix jungler players to max W first instead of Q wich increases the cc on the target for more strong ganks because the Q becomes depending ennemy missing health as 4% unchangable with maxing the q , all ranks 4% missing health..(4% is just an exmaple it can be 10% or 20% I don't care I'm just telling the Idea not the amount , cause there's profissionals to do this, not me for sure xD.\n        5) An other important point, You maybe can Increase the mana cast of kha wich means nerfing him a litte bit, because really he have so low mana cast spells for example his q only 25 mana -_- .. ok being top or mid , it's fine by making the mana cast so low because top or mid always needs so much and much mana. but being jungle isn't the same..If you remember riot, you  did changes to alistar last couple of years by making the mana cast so hight wich made him in mana problems when he goes supp , but didn't do any matter for his jungling , so please do the same thing with kha'zix to make it so hard , and rly so so hard going as mid or top , and to make you fall in mana probs i","replies":[{"poster":"IDreXus","date":"2014-07-19T00:37:28.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you go mid or top with kha wich allows kha'zix to be a jungler chamion as his specific lane..\n\n    Ok that's all, but I want just to tell you that , I played kha'zix after the nerf , and he became rly nothing, he became the weakest champion I've ever seen in my life, he became so anooying , people stops playing him, and that hurts me so much, because it's my main champ..\nSo please, please try maybe to change some few things in kha'zix by taking some of those Ideas that I told you about (look above to see them) and to make kha'zix becoming a strong beast in the jungle and to make him Revive to league of legends and make people come back loving kha'zix.. please think about that.. :/\n\nBy the Way, I want to say, thanx riot for making this game growing up with us and for giving this game a lot of care and a lot of your importance.. really thanx.

So i feel like \"maybe snoopeh can make some question, lot of players can feel concerned with too, but as Christina did not start that point in the talk, he has no chance to talk about it..\"\n\nFor example, I would like Ahri been a point in the talk too, but she was not. And maybe, maybe not, snoopeh can ask Nome or Statikk to explain also the Ahri' buf, as the explanation in the patch notes is.... strange: \"..she's currently sitting just below the top-tier mid picks. That said, we don't think she needs too many buffs to keep up\"\n\nWhat about other mid lane champions who are not in the top-tier for a long time ago?\nWhy Ahri (seems) is not allowed to be down of that top-tier for mid picks?\n\nI mean, maybe snoopeh wanted to ask about it, as he also did some really good questions in the talk about timers or lucian. \nBut he had no the chance as Ahri was not introduced by Christina in the talk, so, i feel more time to talk about all changes would be great, or instead, let all the people in the talk start the points they can feel more interesting.\n\nP.D.

Why were they added? What is the reasoning behind them? What kind of design philosophy moves a given champion in a given direction? That's the important stuff, to understand why decisions are made. \n\nIt helps us to understand what the goal of designers is with certain changes, and therefore also better understand what kind of a role a given champion is \"expected\" to fill. \n\nIn any case, thanks for the rundown video!

I already see everything regarding patch notes from other sources so that specifically isn't filling a necessary void. It is nice to see an insider look from the balance team, sort of like what Phreak did before. It was also a great idea to have Snoopeh there to have the competitive knowledge. However, I have to say I much preferred listening to what Snoopeh had to say regarding the changes. Although very critical his logic seemed solid. I'd really like to see more professional players consulted before changes like these are made. What he says about inhibitors needing a timer before jungle camps is especially spot on. I'm not saying this because I am against jungle timers, in fact I've come to enjoy it although it does make the game simpler leaving less of a skill gap between newer and experienced players. It was said in this discussion that jungle timers were something considered for implementation for quite some time, however most people know that the real motivator behind doing so was Curse Voice. Whether or not it had been considered beforehand isn't really the point, if it wasn't for the Curse Voice application controversy this likely would have taken much more time. It's nice to know that the community is being listened to, but I feel like putting the games into the hands of the community is less effective than putting it into the hands of the competitive knowledge base. League of Legends is an E-Sport, the people playing at the highest level do have some idea of what makes the game work, and ways to make it continue to work. This improves quality of life for the casual fanbase, the most important part of the game financially, however making the game feel more alive for the top competitors is what will really make League of Legends a better choice for a sport. Please listen to your competitive audience! I'd love to see even more pro players involved in these discussions talking directly to the development team. A good debate is great for transparency!
