That's worth anything.\n\nI've been playing with my S/O since about April now. Our situations are definitely similar. I ended season 3 in silver 2. Aside from the odd bot game with a less experienced friend, I was playing ranked pretty much exclusively for the start of season 4. Then, I made a deal with my S/O that got her to try it out and she liked it. She didn't have much gaming experience and no experience with games like LoL, so she had a lot to learn. Since then, she has become worlds better. Shes gone from straight up liability and feeder to someone who has won ranked games (not often, but it happens). Maybe if I share our story, then it will be a bit of advice for you and others who want to get their inexperienced S/Os playing LoL. \n\nWe started off playing beginner bots. I would ADC and she would pretty much just hide in the bushes as Soraka and heal me when necessary. Thats how she started learning the basics of how to use a character. It was slow going and, frankly, dreadfully boring for me. What did I do to make it more enjoyable? After all, you want to have fun too, right? I bought the hardest characters and started training with them while leading my S/O around. It gave me a chance to grow with her and really helped make the most of it. Soon enough, she was succeeding in beginner bots on her own and then had moved on to intermediate bots. It was really great progress and it happened pretty fast after exerting some good patience. Then the big change happened: pvp.\n\nShe discovered ARAM. I had been an exclusive SR player so it was new to me. We started playing, and she liked that too. We played almost every day for most of the past 7 months. Its where she learnt how she liked to play. , who she liked to play and how to use them. I can't stress enough that **ARAM IS THE BEST PLACE FOR A NEWER PLAYER TO LEARN TO PVP**. Why?\n\nIn ARAM:\n• Map awareness is less important (such a hard skill for someone who trying to learn to use their characters)\n• Farming is less important\n• 1v1 skills are less important\n• Expectations of skill and success for individuals are less important\n• People are more tolerant of mistakes and struggles\n• Support from allies is readily available.\n• Team fighting is common\n• There is tons of action\n• MOST IMPORTANT - It exposes new characters to a wide range of champs and team comps because they are forced to both play a variety of champions and play against; people tend to play the champs they are most familiar with in PVP on the rift since they are afraid of doing poorly and want to do their best. \n\nWe still play ARAM all the time, but now we have a ranked team for 3v3s and are playing 5v5s on the Rift. We're going to start a team for that too. It has been a long journey and it was hard on both of us, but in the end it is so worth it to play with your S/O. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Sadme","date":"2014-12-11T10:32:33.759+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I learned how to play at first in ARAM, too and I am also teaching my boyfriend who is new to games like League through ARAM.

Nothing made me happier than supporting him when he was learning :) :).\n\nNow, he's about level 25 and supports me every day.

We met at The Labyrinth of Jareth, and had generally hit it off, but we only exchanged summoner information.  We played together a couple of times over the next week, and I decided to ask her out in part because she was calm and good spirited in game.  In the five months between the first date and now, we haven't spent more than two days apart, and we lane together frequently.  We (usually) synergize incredibly well.  Plus she's a support main, so we never fight over role.   It's pretty wonderful.","replies":[{"poster":"Neuropraxia","date":"2014-12-11T07:38:12.541+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So there I was, lurking the forums, when I see this thread about laning couples. \"Cool,\" I happily think to myself, \"I can tell my adorable story about how LoL formed the basis of my relationship with my person and everyone will melt and be gooey and happy!\" -- only to discover that some ways down the page, my boyfriend had already posted about us. The interjection \"Rats!\" has never been more appropriate.\n\nSo yeah, girlfriend in question checking in here. :D Laning with this one is basically the best. I've mained support since I started playing, but I've never synergized with anyone the way I synergize with him. It's great to play with someone I know I can trust and who consistently makes calls I understand implicitly and can follow up on. It's a really wonderful experience, and I love that it's something we can do together. \n\nThanks, Riot! :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChickenWrap","date":"2014-12-11T01:47:01.356+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"And now we begin a story of how I met the love of my life. Oddly enough, I recounted the just a little bit ago to my friends.\n\nOnce upon a time, I was looking for a ranked team in Team recruitment. I found one full of platinum players and joined on as their support (the only role available, I much prefer Jungle), and I supported a pretty nice guy. We won quite a few games but our leader who only played *Split push top lane Zed* was very upset with us because we didn't capitalize on \"every opportunity\" he gave us (which wasn't much because he was never a threat)\n\nSo eventually he kicks us all off the team and we go off and make our own. Our jungle takes his main -- top, and I take my main, jungle. We're short a support player. \n\nFear not, says one of the players. For I have a support! (I was actually talking to one of my friends about joining the game at that very moment to play our support, since it's his main.) \n\nSo he brings them into Skype and the first thing I hear is \"Hi guys.\"\n\nBe still my beating heart. It's a female.\n\nShe says that we can call her Len, because people mess up her real name a lot. Glenn, you say? Of course I'll call you Glenn, Glenn!\n\nSo I called her Glenn for the next few games until she was, I believe, furious at me. \n\nThe team ended disbanding eventually, but I still had her on Skype and a month later I moved to Vancouver to attend a school. When I got there I struck up a conversation with her which didn't last long. Basically \"I live in Vancouver, what're you up to?\"\n\nShe was up to nothing. \n\nLater that night my cousin who lives with my Great Uncle (where I was living at the time) tells me that her boyfriend is coming over and she wants me to stay up with her because she doesn't want to stay up alone.\n\nSure thing, I said. \n\nHe didn't show up until 4 hours after he said he would (4 in the morning)\n\nI asked Glenn if I should stay up with my cousin, for something to talk about and she said \"Of course you should!\"\n\nWe talked for a few hours that night.\n\nNext day she calls me.\n\nThis repeats for a long time until eventually we're talking for hours on end each day over Skype and I'm like \"Gee, I think I'm starting to have feelings for her.\"\n\nGet in good with her mom despite Len not wanting me to, I circumnavigated her wishes by writing on pieces of paper and then putting them up in front of my webcam when her mother walked into the room. She would always answer the questions I asked her.\n\nA month later I ask her out. She makes a high pitched squeaking sound and hangs up the Skype call. I ask her if she's OK, she says \"yes she's OK\"\n\nSo I ask her over text. No response. \n\n\"Well until you say yes or no I'm going to keep asking. I'll ask tomorrow, then maybe wait a day, then ask again. Then next week, then maybe two weeks from then, then next month, then next year, then maybe five years from then, but I'm never going to stop until you give me an answer\"\n\nSo I run to a friend of mine and go \"I asked this girl out and she cut the Skype call but we've been talking a ton and I really like her what do I do?\"\n\nResponse: She wants your D. (This is why I no longer ask girls for advice. They're so rude.)\n\nNext day is Tuesday. I get up early before school and ask her. She's awake. She calls me.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\nShe hangs up, and calls me again\n\n\"You don't have to decide now, It's O--\"\n\nCut off\n\nShe says \"Yes, I want to be your girlfriend.\"\n\nShe's afraid of bringing down my MMR so she says we can't ever play ranked together but I've never had as much fun or joy playing anything with anyone ever before in my life.\n\nWe've been together since October 15th, 2013, which is also my mothers birthday. Needless to say, I called her the second she said yes and told my mother that for her birthday, I got myself a girlfriend.\n\nMy mom would have prefered a present, but I was way too far away from her, so there, mom. \n\nAnd *that's just the short version*.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Bad Talon","date":"2014-12-10T22:26:57.986+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play ARAMs with him so, yeah, we always lane together.\n\nObligatory https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLo3AUdZUkE","replies":[]}]}
