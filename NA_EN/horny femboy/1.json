No, no one is in the LGBT community? Ok. Yes there are? Cool. Whats with you weird league gatekeepers who think hurrdurr a champions gay it must be automatic pandering nonsense, keep it to yourselves. And no, you can't definitively say having something for diversity sake is inherently not a good thing. Having the one token gay to profit off of is imo bad, so if you think thats the case, sure. Fleshing out already existing ideas about champions and theyre lgbt, then sure why not. If it contributes to their lore and their relationships to other champions then it should be in some fashion explicitly stated. Not Schrodingers Gay so that they can profit off the idea without giving in and being flamed by homophobes.

Yet the answer itself seemed strangely restrained to me, even before the Varus lore update unabashedly revealed our first queer champion.  It sounded less like a creator definitely saying \"Yes, Taliyah is into girls, too,\" and more like a public relations statement carefully crafted to avoid what Riot seemed to find a thorny question by being interpret-able in several ways.\n\nFirst, Taliyah could be into boys and not girls, but for their hearts rather than their looks.  This interpretation fits her being a thoughtful, sincere character, but the writers could have just said so if their elaborate answer meant just that.  Also, the way the response was written leaves open a different interpretation, which is that Taliyah is into boys _and_ girls, with her prioritizing the content of a partner's character being code for her being bi.  But again, the writers could have just said so instead of beating around the bush.\n\nThis equivocation seems to be intentional.  When Taliyah was released, Varus' lore had not been updated; Riot lacked experience making queer champions.  The writing staff had doubtless wanted to make one long before then, and they just as doubtlessly saw their answer to that question as a chance to toe the water.  Therefore, I think they decided to write an answer onto which each fan would project his or her hopes for the character.\n\nThis is important!  It was League's first foray into the world of queer characters--the first ray of hope for all the ho-shippers and slash-authors who until then could base their stories on either stretched views of character behavior or outright original content.  They dreamed and wrote in a canon separate from everyone else.  Unless Riot sends someone to answer this question, which I hope they do, I doubt we will ever know for sure.  \n\nAnd one final note: remember that even late adolescence can be fraught with questions of personal identity, which are made no easier by the fact that sexual orientation is on a spectrum.  Almost everyone attracted to only one sex appreciates the looks of the other one, and many bisexual people have a preference for one sex or the other.  Disentangling these feelings can be hard enough for someone living a peaceful life with friends and family around to help.  Taliyah's whole story is overcoming adversity to reunite with family, so perhaps even the Stoneweaver herself would struggle to answer the question were she asked today.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Marbelara","date":"2017-12-20T11:18:21.298+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:51}} {{champion:254}} are heavily speculated after the cupcake comment cemented itself in the fandom","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nasuuna","date":"2017-12-19T22:06:23.049+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well Zoe has a crush on  ezreal sooooo\n\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}\n\nalso\n\n{{champion:28}} \n\nIn her short story she targets both men and women","replies":[{"poster":"HalfTangible","date":"2017-12-20T06:59:38.573+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"To be fair, Eve is technically genderless (shadow demon) and it's implied she doesn't actually bang anyone.\n\nAnd in that story in particular, I didn't get the impression she was targetting the wife for banging.
