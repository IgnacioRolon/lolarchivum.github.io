The \"it's just X\" argument to me is more often than not just an excuse to not try as hard as one should or is used to try to excuse poor behavior. Another mindset I'm personally not a fan of is the \"end fast\" one, where people want to try to end games as fast as possible (often in 7 minutes) for various reasons, such as they have somewhere to be soon or they want to try to account level as fast as possible. As someone who plays primarily co-op vs. ai I rarely if ever have fun in these types of games since I just want to practice different things and/or just enjoy playing the game like normal in general.\n\nNot sure what can be done about people with these types of mindsets but I definitely agree that they're more often than not detrimental if that makes sense.","replies":[{"poster":"TimX24968B","date":"2019-07-21T18:45:09.371+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"end fast\" can be valid however, if you have an early game team comp, or if the enemy has a late game team comp.","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2019-07-21T22:11:05.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TimX24968B,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=5E1AyotM,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2019-07-21T18:45:09.371+0000)\n>\n> \"end fast\" can be valid however, if you have an early game team comp, or if the enemy has a late game team comp.\n\nPerhaps, but more often than not I see it used by people who just want games to end at 7 minutes, with some of them getting upset if it doesn't happen.","replies":[{"poster":"TimX24968B","date":"2019-07-22T01:08:26.189+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"agreed.  if you dont have at least an hour to commit to a game, don't start it.","replies":[{"poster":"Freaktory","date":"2019-07-22T21:59:34.750+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about the people who will go through the process to start a game, wait for the match to start (everyone gets into thier lane) and you read\n\n... \"I gotta Go\" (usually school, appointment, etc)\n\nThe people who know they have to leave yet still que up anyways and wait for a game to start, then announce that they have to go. \nAnd they will often use \"Chill, its just a game\" when you get mad at them for starting a game only to leave 3-5 minutes in. \n\nOn top of that the \"Its just X\" is usually an excuse for players to ignore/dismiss people who are trying to win.
