This issue led to my last game, got stuck didn't know so I had to restart my computer. This is literally the ONLY way I can fix this issue that I know of, I can't tab out or bring up task manager.\r\n\r\nSo I figured, no big deal because my team could at least remake since I was gone for over 5 minutes at least, and it was a normal game. No one gets hurt and we just have to reque. But no. Not only did they not remake, they refused any form of vote afterwards. Playing as jungler made this a literal nightmare. It's much harder to catch up, and you now have the fear of constant invades (That very much happened) since you're low level. To put into perspective, my lvl 1 vs the enemy junglers lvl 6. And it was a Garen.\r\n\r\nInstead of moving to the next game people decide to now hold games hostage like this. Duo queues will refuse remake, early votes etc even if someone is completely dc/d. This combination is infuriating. And it was a Normal game, so even less incentive to play it out instead of just finding a game that loaded properly.\r\n\r\nSo now I'm being forced to play a miserable game, my dc assured even IF we won I wouldn't receive rewards at the end anyway. Then the duo que trolled further by taking my camps that I desperately need to try and get back into the game.\r\n\r\nIt's been happening more often than not, and the players on both sides are endlessly toxic about it. I think after the anniversary I have to break from this game. It's not the same good times like season 3 and 4 made me feel.","replies":[]}
