I want this thread to serve as a place where Champions/Items that are potential targets for Riot&#039;s nerf hammer or buff mallet in time for Worlds.\n\nPersonally, some of the targets of Riot&#039;s nerf hammer should be:\n\n* Juggernauts (Watch list) - Too early to tell their impact, but they&#039;ll probably be kept an eye on in the coming patch and see how they fit in.\n\n* Gangplank (Watch list) - I&#039;m just gonna say it, he&#039;s too strong right now. Barrels are far too oppressive with that 60% armor shred AND slow AND the ability to apply crits through the trigger-attack, but the nerf on the armor shred may hold it back for now and make him more situational. Regardless, the Pirate&#039;s a really powerful guy right now, so we&#039;ll wait and see what happens.\n* Gnar (Watch list) - I remember a while back when Gnar was nerfed that Riot said \"Any champ who is based around _inconsistency_ and is a strong pick competitively is concerning\" - which is somewhat true with the new Black Cleaver. Except he&#039;s now a splitpush menace who&#039;s hard to shift out of lane, teamfights notwithstanding. \n* Gragas (Potential target) - I don&#039;t think the fat man&#039;s been shifted out of the jungle since the Cinderhulk changes took place. And he&#039;s still a really strong pick. This may just be a vanity thing, but I feel he&#039;s spent far too long in the spotlight, and I would _like_ to see some changes.\n* Kog&#039;Maw (Watch list) - A lot of this is tied to Trinity Force, but I feel the Triforce snuffs out what should be a weakish mid-game to compensate for his godly late-game power. It&#039;s nice to see him as a pick again, but it&#039;s possible he&#039;s spiking because of the Triforce.\n* Viktor (Watch list) - Viktor&#039;s another example of a champ that&#039;s really oppressive in the competitive scene right now, but like Gangplank, he&#039;s got some changes on his Hex Core that could shake things up. It&#039;s another wait and see situation for him.\n* Sivir (Potential target\n* Tristana (Potential target) - She&#039;s a super strong tower pusher and destroyer, but I feel she&#039;s blowing stuff up a little too quickly for my liking. That and she has a fairly safe and strong early game.\n* Yasuo (Watch list) - Yasuo&#039;s picking up wind competitively again, most notably with ZionSpartan crushing Dyrus with it in Game 1 of the NA Summer Finals. While it still feels like a mixed bag in strength, it&#039;ll probably be worth Riot keeping an eye on him.\n\n* Trinity Force (Potential target) - What&#039;s this? Triforce nerfs before Worlds?! UNACCEPTABLE! In real terms though, there are a lot of Triforce users that are super strong right now because of the HUGE damage spike it gives to champions like Corki/Gangplank/Kog&#039;Maw. It&#039;s also been an item that&#039;s been strong for a while, so it may see changes before Worlds.\n* Zeke&#039;s Harbinger (Target) - Way too strong. 50% Crit chance is unbelievably strong and is being consistently used on AD auto attackers instead of AP champs. I foresee a crit chance nerf and AP scaling buff coming up to open up a bit more conduit diversity.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-08-30T23:06:29.591+0000","up_votes":96,"down_votes":6,"body":"Some of the stuff we're looking at for 5.18:\n\nExploring Buffs\n\n* Zyra\n* Veigar\n* Syndra\n* Twitch\n\nLikely Nerfs\n\n* Fiora\n* Morde\n\nOn watch/needs investigation\n\n* Skarner/Darius/Garen (where are they post 5.17?)\n* Devourer (too strong?)\n* AD Ezreal (too weak?)\n* Lulu (too strong solo, too weak support?)\n* Vayne (too reliably strong?)\n\n\nOdds are high some other champs will end up being worked on too, and that some champs above will end up being taken off the list as work on the patch continues.

'Everyone says' doesn't necessarily equal true though. \n\nThere are a lot of anti Vayne threads on Boards, with you there. That indicates that, at the very least, a lot of players are finding Vayne really frustrating. Frustrating doesn't necessarily mean overpowered however, though the two are correlated. Champions sometimes generate a lot of frustration feedback even when balanced or underpowered (e.g. Blitzcrank really annoys some people regardless of his balance state and waves of anti Blitz threads crop up every so often). It's also important to remember that the population of Boards isn't necessarily representative of the entire player base (it's a subset of the english speaking population from certain servers). \n\nHaving said that though it's very possible Vayne's too strong at the moment. Her win rate in solo queue is quite high for such a popular champion. That, particularly when combined with the frustration she's causing, means she's worth investigating. Doesn't necessarily mean nerfing Vanye's the appropriate outcome though.  It's possible we might find that Vayne's too dominant at present because the champions that should be keeping her in check in lane are weak and need to be buffed. Or because items she scales especially well with are overpowered. Or because other meta conditions (lots of HP stacking champs for example) are very favourable to her. Or even some combination of all those factors and too strong a kit, hence the need for some investigation.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2015-08-30T23:16:19.668+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm not sure why Skarner is on the watch instead of very likely.

Being that this was such a huge change in a champion, I would hope that these threads have been read. We do not want our favorite champ to be unplayable. Nobody wants that. It is very frustrating to not have any feedback on Mord from Rioters when we have been constantly saying his solo lane is terrible now, yet someone at Riot (can't remember who) specifically stated that you guys did not want to kill solokaiser. \n\nMany things people have been saying:\n- W needs to be self cast with lower healing\n- Q's 3rd hit needs to be toned down.\n- A bit of power brought back into his E\n\nThat would allow him to not be as linear. As of now he is simply:\n- Farm up to get a lead\n- Get dragon and take another objective (like a tower)\n- Hit someone with your 3rd Q (as this is the only real damage he has until late game).","replies":[]},{"poster":"toonpang","date":"2015-08-31T14:02:38.091+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I doubt he'll get back to a 50% win rate though\n\n**Why isn't Morde allowed to have a 50% winrate?

Removing his attack speed slow _and_ his heal from his W while leaving its mana cost so high has left him the SoloKaiser of bot lane.

Ratio changes, overall damage changes, or adding certain things that their kit needs to balance out their play style or to make them more viable in this meta? For example:\n\nZyra - Early game plant damage is weak, late game plant damage is high especially in combination with items like Liandry's Torment and the root doesn't seem really help in maximizing her plant damage and so often most of her plants are used to either put an extra bit of burst damage on the use of Q, E or R or they are used for a zoning tool/slowing tool.\n\nVeigar - Extremely low mobility (340 move speed), high burst. Absolutely love the changes that were made to him, especially the Q but with the speed of how the game is currently moving (most people move at around ~400 now as opposed to the old 390ish), Veigar's low mobility really puts a crutch on him against high mobility champions or champions who build Dead Man's Plate. All that said, my idea for Veigar was instead of passive increase to his speed, perhaps give a short burst of speed like with the Bilgewater item Netherstride Grimoire after using his Q.\n\nSyndra - Her kit feels as if it is in a good place currently, damage is appropriate but could be tweaked a tiny bit mid game (imo) and I'd kill to see her W be able to throw wards so you can mess with the enemies vision. She is also extremely immobile but has a large stun to counter-act that so it isn't as big of a problem as Veigar's is.\n\nTwitch - He feels like a weaker version of Vayne but also requires more items to be a threat than Vayne. Possibly tweak or change his W to be more useful and add a bit more early game damage on his E.\n\nThese are just a few thoughts I had on how these Champions could be changed to be more viable in the current style of game.","replies":[{"poster":"Casri","date":"2015-08-31T20:57:40.292+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Veigar - Extremely low mobility (340 move speed)\n\nSorry, it is indisputable that Veigar is immobile, but 340 move speed is waaaay better than the majority of mages!

If the non-late game marksman were stronger or picked more often I don't she'd be such an issue in the competitive scene since it's the meta allowing her to flourish.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Athenes Lulu","date":"2015-08-31T03:28:21.837+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That reminds me.... you got any ideas of what Lulu support should excel in, and what she's weak at?\n\nAs of now, she excels at none, but can do everything other than healing and providing sustain. Her pokes are subpar mainly because of her extremely high mana costs, her peels are extremely limited (compared to Janna and Alistar's), she's definitely not THE tank, and her utlity isn't the best until she gets enough items to scale/go tanky enough to not get 1-shotted in teamfights.\n\nBecause we have watched enough LCS to know what supports do: roam, run only on mobis and level 1 support item, and a bunch of consumables. Rely only on base CC and utility to set up kills and make flashy plays for the team.\n\nAs you can see, even a Lulu support can't do that **without** items, and that her utility isn't *built* to set up free kills for teammates. Which explains, most likely, Lulu won't be played as a support ever again on the LCS unless she is reworked to be able to do the \"setup\" play.\n\nSo just wondering, what KIND of support do you want to see Lulu as? As of now it's rough trying to find out because we don't even know.

She is still pick/banned nearly every pro game, and I for one would find it ridiculous if she doesn't see any nerfs and keeps up the high pick/ban rate at worlds.
