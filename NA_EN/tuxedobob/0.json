There was a time a few years ago when I played it regularly. But then life happened, and I spent more time in other games, and coming back a year later, I really have no idea what I&#039;m doing. I used to play support and jungle. I managed to crawl my way to gold (aka the new Bronze 1) in season three. And when the season ended, I took a break.\r\n\r\nNow, not only is the map completely different, but so are core mechanics and items for both of those positions. And the champions. If you consider the game is made up of three parts&mdash;&nbsp;the map, the champions, and the items&mdash;&nbsp;and all three have changed significantly over the past, what, year or two?, then the game is completely different from before. I go to build an item, and hey, that doesn&#039;t exist anymore. I pick a champ and the abilities are all completely different. Okay, well how the hell do I play this now? Even *smite* was made complicated, because why have an ability that just does what it says? Nah, you should really read tooltips on everything. You know, once they spawn and the game&#039;s already started.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s almost as bad as these boards. What was wrong with the forums, anyway? Too much organization? Too clean a layout? Not enough voting? Oh, look, now you can vote on the thread. You can vote on comments. Hell, you can probably vote on the votes.\r\n\r\nI just... it&#039;s too much. I can&#039;t play this anymore, and the boards make no sense.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-10-05T03:15:03.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your talking about a company who develops nothing but THIS ONE GAME. What do you expect...\n\nVoting on posts? I'm pretty sure that was always here. That's a common feature of most forums.\n\nActives like smite more complicated? Riot added diversity (again... they have NOTHING ELSE TO DO), in all honesty, the changes are cool and allow for a lot more playstyles. But yes, it takes some getting used to, and reading.\n\nReworked champs? Yyyyeeeeaaaah, that's a tossup depending on who you ask, but again, every champ that had a primitive kit, well, that stuck out when more creative kits were added with new champions every month. Riot doesn't want to leave a champ in the dust, so yes, with their MASSIVE SUCCESS AND FUNDING ALL FUNNELED INTO A SINGLE FREAKIN' GAME, they are going to FIX EVERYTHING. Even things YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO FIX. That's how it works.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-10-05T03:07:38.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a season catchup article that outlines the important changes (up til the new juggernauts) if I could find it.\n\nIf the game doesn't change, it gets stale.

You don't have to play constantly to keep up to date, just do your occasional match and read the patch notes.\n\nEdit: [Ah, here we go.
