Bard comes in if the balance is threatened. Ryze is keeping the scroll safe, so the universe is not in danger until the caretaker of the scroll is gone and the badguys are about to get their hands on it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2015-03-06T17:13:52.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know if bringing the scroll in a battlefield against tons of powerful beings (some of them being from events he wanted to stop at Shurima and SI) who surely are on par (if not superior) to Ryze himself is a good idea at all.\n\nPpl seem to think that Ryze is somehow more powerful than other champions without anything to bring up to justify it.","replies":[{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2015-03-06T17:32:50.616+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, Protecting the scroll is his task, but is not his only task.

Think of it in terms of the old man in Bard:Mountain. Ryze is basically like the old man was just holding the egg/moonstone, nothing threatening here. Ezreal is like the old man firing bolts from the artifact to protect himself, not much of a problem here either. It's only when the artifact becomes significantly dangerous, like accidentally cutting a mountain in half, does Bard take full notice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BLU Medic","date":"2015-03-07T20:38:33.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It wouldn't surprise me if Bard took every item in the shop apart from potions and Doran's items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pikmints","date":"2015-03-07T02:05:53.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:201}} 's shield - able to stop an infinite damage Veigar ultimate without losing anything more than a little mana.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2015-03-06T18:55:53.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think he would go after Ryzes scroll if it was used by someone in a \"wrong\" way.\nHowever the problem is that Bards definition of right and wrong might not align with Ryzes(or that Ryze thinks that not even bard can keep it safe),so while i think that bard might go after the scroll eventually,I doubt that Ryze is going to give it to him that easily.","replies":[]}]}
