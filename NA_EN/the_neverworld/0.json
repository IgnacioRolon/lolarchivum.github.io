His name was Sidicus, but I made him to a girl. Yeah, sounds creepy, I know. I still hope you can enjoy it..)  \n\n-----------\n\n#***Lore***\n***\"I once had a diary that I’ve lost somewhere. I know that there was something important in it, but I would really love to remember. I just hope no one finds my diary, especially not Lux***\" {{champion:81}} \n\n*\"**Sidia** was an ordinary girl and ordinary student, who studied arcane arts and their influence on the environment in the **Piltover Academy**. Sidia had the best grades on the Academy, she worked hard to achieve acknowledgement and a good reputation. Unfortunately, when the popularity of a young explorer named **Ezreal** was spread across whole Piltover, Sidia’s grades went down. The Piltover Academy started to compare their students with Ezreal, the Prodigal Explorer, who was not only the best student, but also achieved great things even though he was so young. *  \n\n*Since aeons in Runeterra’s history, rivalry is something that accompanies the good people, and the wicked ones. Even though this rivalry was never on the surface, Sidia hated Ezreal. Within the academy, within the city and even in her own home – she was compared with him. She was for most people no longer a individual person, but the next successor of someone else. Her own parents, despite of her feelings, praised Ezreal and his achievements. It was not long after, when Sidia was weary of her surroundings, and went to the only place known for its silent atmosphere – the famous **Library of Piltover**. In this place, she could stay her whole life, gathering wisdom and not being seen as the next talented youngster. * \n  \n\n*When she searched for a book, she found a **diary** stuck between two bookshelves. It was the diary of Ezreal, in which the coordination of a possible remnant was written. Sidia, in hope to find a artefact that increases her reputation, travelled to the coordinates, and found a cave. Unfortunately, the cave was closed by massive rocks, but she didn’t give up. It was then when she found a hidden switch, which miraculously sent the rocks aside, as if the rocks were the gates. What she found inside, was a great cave full of pure magic crystals, and a great black tree root placed on a podium. When she came closer to it, the roots released from the podium and snapped her arms, until her arms were completely wrapped up by the roots. When it was complete, she immediately felt that something was changing inside of her. The hatred she felt was significantly increasing and she couldn’t control her feelings. Suddenly, her gloves began to shine red and then a magic beam went straight into the hall of crystals. The magic beam was reflected at each crystal, until it vanished into nothingness. *  \n\n*The power she was wielding in her own hands, increased the obsession of her rival so much, that she joined the League of Legends in order to defeat Ezreal and create her own popularity, until one day, the people may use her as an example of a great Piltover student, and not her rival, Ezreal. \"*\n\n-------\n#***Appearance***  \n\nSidia pretty much looks like this:  \nhttp://rousteinire.deviantart.com/art/Student-Council-President-473432584  \n\nHer weapons are her dual gloves. In addition, she deploys crystal towers in order to reflect her abilities.  \nhttp://www.mcnallycompanyantiques.com/imgproducts/bigimage/big_pr%20rock%20crystal%20obelisks.jpg  \n\nSidia pretty much sends forth a prismatic bolt like down below. She can also create a straight and endless beam similar.  \nhttp://crybringer.deviantart.com/art/151-PRISMATIC-SPARK-24695596  \n\n(Please click on the picture if you want to be redirected to DeviantArt and its Creator)\n\n\n\n--------------------\n\n#***Champion Explanation***\n\n* *Sidia (**Originally Sidicus – Inspiration from Zeddicus (A mage in the TV novel ‘The Sword of Truth’**)) is a 18 year old student, who obviously hates Ezreal. Normally, she’s a really cute and nice girl, very reliable and works hard.*  \n* *As the Lore says, she was never seen as Sidia, but as the next Ezreal. On top of that, nothing that she ever did was appreciated, because the spotlight was always focused on him. Her feelings have been ignored, the pain she felt was too hard for her to take – and when she was wielding the gloves, she felt a urgent power to ruin Ezreal’s reputation and to destroy him.*  \n* *Even though there are more and probably better reasons to fight to death in the League of Legends – Rivalry is something that always coexists with the people. While Ezreal has everything, a Girlfriend, a Boyfriend, a great reputation and the trust of almost all nations – Sidia has nothing of it. She soughs to gain all these things by eliminating Ezreal and free Piltover’s Academy from the continues comparison between their students and a single one being – Ezreal. *  \n* *There are many remains of ancient civilization, like Ezreal, who found an amulet that used to be for a giant person. Nevertheless of the size, Ezreal used it as a glove. Sidia found something like an altar of dark arcane arts, where the roots of a tree was spreading out of a stone podium. Those roots immediately snapped her arms and clinched around her hand and forearm. Though Ezreal found the closed Cave, he never entered nor found out how to go in. However, there are rumors that Ezreal was afraid of what was lying deep inside.*  \n* *Sidia is a Champion who uses her two gloves in order to create a high concentrate amount of prismatic light, in order to create either a bolt of sparks or a constant devastating beam. Either way, her abilities can be reflected by the crystal towers, which can be used to get access to long range targets or to create traps.*   \n* *Due to her strong fortress-like kit, similar to Heimerdinger or Azir – Sidia is a strong lane bully, who can attack her targets from different angles, but is vulnerable to close ranged combat. She is best played at mid, perhaps top too.  *\n\n\n--------------------\n#***Stats***   \nDamage 49 (+3.1 per level)  \nAttackspeed 0.650 (3%)  \nHealth 425 (+74 per level)  \nMovement Speed 330  \nArmor 16 (+2.6 per level)  \nMagic Resist 30 (+0.0 per level)  \nHealth Regen 4.9 (+0.6 per level)  \nMana Regen 6.5 (+0.63 per level)  \nAttack Range 550     \n-------\n#***Abilities***\n-----\n#***Innate Passive - 'Laser Therapy':***   \n*Whenever Sidia’s **Prismatic Bolt** goes through her or an ally Champion, they are healed by **3%/4%/5%** (**Champion Level: 1/6/12**) of their missing health. This can occur up to three times within 15 seconds on the same Champion. *\n------------------------\n#***Q (Skillshot) – ‘Prismatic Bolt‘:***   \n*Upon activation, Sidia sends forth a prismatic bolt up to a range of **650**. The prismatic bolt deals to the enemy target **60/75/90/105/120 (+60% AP) magic damage**. *\n\n***Prismatic Beam:*** *When **holding Q**, the prismatic bolt becomes a prismatic beam, with the same range and deals the same damage every **0.5 second**, but consumes **double amount of mana each second** while active.*\n\n* **Info:** Prismatic Bolt has no cast time and can be used while walking. For the duration of Prismatic Beam, Sidia can’t move. Both Bolt and Beam won’t go through enemy targets like other beam attacks usually do. If Prismatic Beam active is over, the Cooldown begins.\n* **Mana Cost: **   40/50/60/70/80\n* **Cooldown: ** 8.5/8/7.5/7/6.5\n-----------------\n#***W (Placement) - 'Cold Mirror '***   \n*Sidia deploys a Crystal Tower within **300 range** around her. Using a drag & point system, the direction of the Crystal Tower can be adjusted when placing. When **Prismatic Bolt** and **Prismatic Beam** hits the Crystal Tower, the skill will be redirected to the direction where the Crystal Tower is facing. Up to a max of **1/2/3/4/5 Crystal Towers** can be deployed and be active.*\n\n*Once Prismatic Bolt or Beam hits the Crystal tower, nonetheless of the position, it will be redirected from the Crystal Tower **650** range to the direction.*\n\n* **Info:** Crystal Tower is trespass able and can be destroyed with three basic attacks. Crystal Towers don’t decay after a time. A tower can't reflect the same Q a second time, instead the Q projectile vanishes. If an enemy destroys a Crystal Tower, he gains +8 Gold. It is theoretically possible, to attack a spot very far away, if you have the knowledge and skill.\n* **Mana Cost: ** 50/60/70/80/90\n* **Cooldown: **  15/13/11/9/6\n\n http://s14.directupload.net/images/141107/hdr5b6lg.png  \nhttp://s14.directupload.net/images/141107/syj9ynmu.gif  \n----------\n#***E (Buff) - 'Stronghold ':***   \n*Sidia immediately summons all of the deployed Crystal Towers within a **2500 range** around her. The crystal towers then float around her for **2.5/3/3.5/4/4.5 seconds**. Every time Sidia does a **basic attack**, each of the crystal towers shoots a small prismatic bolt. Each projectile deals **25% of Sidia’s Base AD plus 3% of her AP as magic damage**. *\n\n**In addition**, *whenever Sidia gets hit by an enemy basic attack or ability, she loses one of her Crystal Towers. Upon recast or after all Crystal Towers have been destroyed, Sidia shatters her Crystal Towers if not already destroyed, and stuns all enemies near by **300 range for 1.5 seconds**.  *\n\n* **Info:** All Crystal Towers will be collected, this includes the ones from her Ultimate. At 500 AP and with 11 Towers (5 from W, 6 from Ult) this makes 33% of 500 =\n* **Mana Cost: **  70/75/80/85/90\n* **Cooldown: ** 18/16.5/15/13.5/12\n------\n#***Ultimate - 'Crystal Cage ':***  \n*Within **550 range**, Sidia places six Crystal towers in a hexagon. The Crystal Towers begin to immediately shoot a prismatic bolt to the middle of the location. Each prismatic bolt deals **40/50/60(+10% AP)** magic damage up to a total of **240/300/360(+60% AP)**. *  \n*However, the bolts deal the most damage if the target is in the middle, while deals the least damage on the edge.*  \n\n* **Mana Cost: **  100\t\n* **Cooldown: ** 90/80/70\n\nhttp://s14.directupload.net/images/141107/prq5sjyq.gif  \n----------------\n\n#***Concept Explanation***\n\nI’ve tried my best to have a unique kit and mechanic, like Riot always does. Sidia offers great offensive damage, though with only two abilities, but they can be devastating in the right hands. Using the Crystal Towers, the player experiences a new way of controlling the battlefield.  \n\nIn the further explanation, I will show you a example how the Crystal Towers work. If you look below, Sidia shoots her Q, it goes straight to a Crystal Tower, which then will be redirected to the direction its facing. It bounces again and again and again, until it arrives Sidia.   \nhttp://s14.directupload.net/images/141107/zesnri34.gif  \nThere are many other possibilities, like if you’re at mid lane, you theoretically could place a line of Crystal Towers that goes to the enemy red or blue camp and you could snipe it away if you want to. However, this is like I said theoretically, because normally the enemy ganker would find them, except if you are tricky. On the other hand, you’ll lose the key to victory on your lane and your pressure could be worsening.\n\n* ***Innate Passive*** Heals Sidia and ally Champions alike. Only a max of three times within 15 seconds is possible, otherwise it would end up being too powerful.\n* ***Her Q*** sends forth one projectile or a beam, dealing either damage in an instant or damage over time, but the damage over time is very mana hungry.    \n* ***The W*** deploys crystal towers, so that Sidia can use them to attack her opponent from different angles.  \n* ***E***   gives Sidia the ability to summon her crystal towers and deal upfront damage with basic attacks. This is for the situation that she gets forced into close combat.  \n* ***Last, but not least - The Ultimate***, which creates a great damage source, but only if the enemy is stunned or otherwise bound to the middle. If not, only a part of the damage will be applied.\n\nSidia is strong against long range Champions who are normally safe picks, because she can attack from different angles and force them to either run or not to last hit. On the other hand, Sidia can be very difficult when playing against strong close combat Champions, who can easily go on her and finish her off. \n\n------------\n#***Possible Skins***\n\nWarring Kingdom Sidia \nhttp://rousteinire.deviantart.com/art/100-Theme-Geisha-473178571  \n\nCasual Friday Sidia  \nhttp://rousteinire.deviantart.com/art/100-Theme-With-of-Without-You-468627505  \n\nBattle Bunny Sidia  \nhttp://rousteinire.deviantart.com/art/Commission-For-Light-Dax-442566855  \n\nSchool Girl Sidia  \nhttp://25.media.tumblr.com/939fea8f72d374de3c134b8c2831ecc0/tumblr_mgzyuk9dzA1rdpfmko1_500.jpg  \n\nHigh Noon Sidia  \nhttp://rousteinire.deviantart.com/art/Character-Creation-IV-Steam-Punk-Terror-475203551  \n\nRedeemed Sidia  \nhttp://pechan.deviantart.com/art/Upgrade-482226863  \n\nChosen Sidia  \nhttp://pechan.deviantart.com/art/Thief-s-Scarf-456470846    \n\n(Please click on the picture if you want to be redirected to DeviantArt and its Creator)  \n\nThanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed it.  \nIf you want to see more of my work, then feel free to visit my [CCCC](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/rO567m9r-enter-the-neverworld-champion-concept-list) (*Custom Champion Concept Compendium*).","replies":[{"poster":"Fiona123","date":"2014-11-07T18:25:26.001+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like this idea I hope riot will make a champion like this one :) check my idea :P http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/l44wnzUm-idea-for-a-new-champion-hope-the-master-of-sorccery","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shamont","date":"2014-11-09T04:57:23.648+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really luv this idea, riot should do it, id take them forever, but id be worth! this idea is supper cool an unqiue, ive always wanted a crystal laser champ, you have pretty much executed it perfectly. \nSo she has a max of crystal towers on her W, but what if she wants the reposiition one of them, does she have to wait until one is  destroyed, or until she uses E, or does the first one placed disappear when she places and extra one down. Id be cool if attacks that came from crystal pillars did extra damage, or maybe slowed.\nI also feel that her ults better balanced if all six pillars only shoot if she shoots one with AA or Q\ni like it better if she just has regular hands, but maybe with some crystal braces on her wrist to elbows, to keep the crystal theme, which i like, reminds me of prism break from skylanders.

Just a thing about her lore though.. what I thought would be a lot more interesting ( and perhaps a bit more sensual ;) ) how about envy for ezreal's attention?

Finally finding somebody who would be of equal (ish)  intellect, skill and attractive looks as her. Spends time with Ez for some time and falls in love. Eventually finding in the diary (or other incident) where she finds he's in love with another student (Lux maybe??). Then comes her rage and envious hate. Then somewhere along in the diary she finds those coords and does something cunning to get even with Ez (like whats said, above finding an artifact or something try win Ez..)

It was just too giant for a normal person (Probably belonged to a ascended being such as Xerath) and thus Ezreal used it as a glove.
