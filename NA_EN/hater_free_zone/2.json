Cute and Creepy have a very fine line, and not putting in the full effort really puts the character into the second, I.e Lulu's classic model is a lot more creepy then cute, at least imo. \n\nI think the last point in it was testing what was and wasn't possible in the realm of League animation, and with the massive change of direction and the size of Poppy's head, it was a good chance to test the waters. \n\nWhy this sort of thing didn't carry over to other champions like Kled or Ivern is most likely a directional choice, and that full facial animation is A LOT of work, and Poppy only received them due to experimentation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LÃ¹men","date":"2017-03-29T11:50:29.353+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"A modern yordle's facial animations are very easy to see.
