I reviewed the gameplay at 31:50 to 31:55 and saw that he had NO vision. He threw his wind seconds before even placing his ward. The players name is Smurfboard . If there is any way I can post the clip here of the scripter, I would be more than happy doing so. Please get back to me soon about how to post the clip, or if you are able to check my last ranked game please go to 31:50 to see for yourself.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nLongdarkranger\r\n\r\nPS: Nerf ohmwrecker","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-11T22:34:23.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Were you able to report him in post-game?
