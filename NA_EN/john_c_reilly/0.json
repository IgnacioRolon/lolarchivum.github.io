Tried choosing another skin and returning to the original and it keeps the name from the other skin displayed over the original. After getting into the game, I noticed that I was using the Pink  skin, which I had chosen in a game played before the patch update. I was not allowed to choose the color of Chroma.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-29T20:06:11.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey John C Reilly,\n\nThanks for the report!
