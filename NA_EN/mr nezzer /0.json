Attacking, using abilities, and moving have no effect on his model. I have only seen it on Shurima Desert, but other skins may be effected.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-06-02T23:57:40.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Ernest P Warrel -\n\nThanks for the report! Since this skin's using base particles, I have a feeling it may be a larger issue that relates to the champion base skin and other skins using base particles. I can take a look and see what's going on here. :)","replies":[]}]}
