Without your logs it's hard to say anything about the situation, except that the system will not ban you for behaving acceptably. I won't discount the very small chance that there was an error of some kind, but what I normally see is that there is something in the logs which is considered toxic by the community, but which the person in question doesn't see as toxic personally.\n\nIf you do find your logs or get them from the company, I will be happy to take a look and give you my analysis.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mizuki Zahra","date":"2017-10-14T15:49:03.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why ask people to report? more reports dont do anything just report yourself and move on","replies":[]},{"poster":"Å ternberg","date":"2017-10-14T13:01:24.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Word  \"reported\" is considered as a punishable offense, you're welcome.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sona Ping","date":"2017-10-14T12:29:10.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MaiNtEnAnCeFTW,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=nq0pK7pr,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-10-14T12:08:51.532+0000)\n>\n> Apparrently I got a 10 day chat restriction because a leona was blaming me for losing a match.

People get penalties because they violate the agreement by doing things like frequently arguing with or harrassing other players.  Harrassing and threatening other players with the report system is still harrassing other players.\nYou got a chat restriction not from this single game, but for your pattern of behaviour.\n\n>Can i view it again or something?\n\nYou should have a copy in your Email.\n  You may screenshot it and post in this thread if you would like to discuss it.  Some people like to do that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-10-14T12:16:02.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Asking others to report somebody is considered harassment. It also does nothing because the system only needs one report and any past that functionally do nothing.\n\n1 report = their logs are reviewed. More reports do not make it review them any harder.\n\nThat being said, usually it takes a bit more than that to cause a punishment, so seeing your logs would help a lot. Idk if there is a way for you to retrieve them, maybe someone else will have the answer.\n\nAlso, curse words are not punishable by themselves, only when targetted at other people, and non curse words are not inherently non punishable.","replies":[]}]}
