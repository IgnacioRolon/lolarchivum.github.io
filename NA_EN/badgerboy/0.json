Everything was fine, the second window flashed on the bottom bar like it was about to take over the full screen, and then nothing happened. I tried closing that window and reconnecting about 5 times, then closing and rebooting the client about 5 times, then even restarting my computer 2 times, nothing got that secondary window that loads the game to do anything other than be an icon on the bottom bar. \r\n\r\nAny ideas on this? Super obnoxious and there seems to be no documentation on solves for this that I can find as of yet. This will be the second leaver game I'll have in two days and I'm not happy about it. Nothing is wrong with internet, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-15T20:07:26.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That does sound obnoxious, and the culprit in this case may be a connection problem.

The launcher just won't do anything but pop up as an icon on my status bar and do nothing else. If I try to alt tab to it, there's nothing shown as part of that window. Tried all sensible solutions, the only one I can think of as not having been done correctly is potentially the firewall issue. Avast has some game mode that it uses now, but apart from that I couldn't control my windows firewall separate from the app and thus am not sure if I did it correctly.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-20T15:25:00.555+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When champion selection ends, your network needs to transition to the game server.

I'll check and see if it works.
