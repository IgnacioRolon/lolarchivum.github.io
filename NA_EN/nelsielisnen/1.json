Less reworks per year, more time put into new champs. And I'm sitting here like.. really? I mean sure, outdated champs have lessened, but, is this really the right time for Riot to let their veteran roster stagnate even more? Last year was one of the most interesting ones in terms of steps taken to modernize league. All the new reworks and runes finally created this ambitious momentum and it felt like league was well on its way to bring its content up to modern standards, regardless of reception. Reading reav3's thoughts I could not help flooding my brain with all the champs that are either in dire need of a complete overhaul or straight up look outdated aesthetically. Feel free to disagree but all the following champs, I think, really need some kind of rework: \r\n* Amumu, \r\n* Anivia, \r\n* Annie, \r\n* Cho, \r\n* Corki, \r\n* Mundo, \r\n* Garen, \r\n* Janna, \r\n* Gragas, \r\n* Kennen, \r\n* Kog'maw, \r\n* Malphite, \r\n* Yi, \r\n* Olaf, \r\n* Shaco, \r\n* Sivir, \r\n* Udyr, \r\n* Veigar, \r\n* Zilean, \r\n* Lux, \r\n* Leblanc, \r\n* Cassio, \r\n* Karma, \r\n* Jarvan, \r\n* Nocturne, \r\n* Lee, \r\n* Brand, \r\n* Rumble, \r\n* Wukong, \r\n* Skarner, \r\n* Talon, \r\n* Riven, \r\n* Xerath, \r\n* Voli, \r\n* Zac, \r\n* Jax, \r\n* Kassadin, \r\n* Ashe, \r\n* frickin MALZAHAR and VLAD, \r\n* Fiddle \r\n* Quinn of course. \r\nThey are not in order of importance or anything like that, but I shaped it into a column to stress the sheer volume of work that must be put into this monolith of a game. I just can't see how riot can afford to sport 40+ blatantly outdated champs and still feel like there's no reason to rush. If they're going for 3-4 reworks a year, well, you do the math, because I don't even want to think of how long it would take for the current roster to fully evolve. Is there anyone else that feels like Riot should focus almost exclusively on reviving old characters from the depths of time and sparingly release new ones?","replies":[{"poster":"Smurfraka","date":"2019-04-24T18:13:41.884+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You forgot Tryndamere.","replies":[{"poster":"NelsieLisnen","date":"2019-04-24T19:19:52.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Smurfraka,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=FquabE8g,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2019-04-24T18:13:41.884+0000)\n>\n> You forgot Tryndamere.\n\nYes, I actually didn't know if I wanted to include him, I kinda don't know what to think about him.

In the first group you mention, for me, the overarching issue is either outdated models, or models that are out of sync with League's current aesthetic, i.e. Garen's armor or Zilean, Talon and Malz having the ragdoll syndrome. I'm also not a fan of those VFX updates as they just seem like an easy way to avoid the issues of a champ by temporarily appeasing their fans. Now Annie is a concept I can't wrap my head around.

Yes they've made some texture updates on champs like malz but compare their models to a Poppy, Akali, Irelia, Warwick to name a few, with all their fluid animations and rich expression. Next to these they look like Ps1 characters. If I mained one of them I'd be bummed they're not gettin some love. My problem with Annie is not the quality of her model, that has somewhat caught up, but her nonsensical theme.

Some notable ones that you pointed out that I agree with on this list are: Fiddlesticks, Volibear, Wukong, Udyr, Amumu, and Mundo. These are just my opinions so feel free to disagree but these all feel like genuinely outdated kits.\n\nThanks for the comment, I'm actually impressed by the amount of people debating Anivia. She falls in this group I feel could use a change of aesthetic direction, while she doesn't have a problematic kit at all. The issue with her is, her largely geometric design is able to accomodate her low polygon model, yet I still think they could opt into making her more, visually interesting let's say, with more dynamic animations, less clunky flight animations etc. And it's a pity especially because flying characters can have A LOT of freedom of movement","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hrooza dota ","date":"2019-04-24T19:25:24.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">After Mordekaiserâs VGU this year, weâll have gotten through the last of the champions in need of his level of work (think updates the size of Urgotâs, Nunuâs, and Swainâs).

Although it's up to Riot's whims at the end of the day. Even so, at their current pace, it'd take heeeella long to update all the roster.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Power Cosmic","date":"2019-04-24T18:58:33.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of people that play League are not on this Board or on Reddit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2019-04-24T16:20:07.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"No, reworks are dumb","replies":[]}]}
