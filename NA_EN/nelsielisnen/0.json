Missions should either be super easy to just coax you into playing, which is the case for league, or really wacky and creative, easy or not. That one was just weird. What I got was \"snowball the game but don't end just bm until you can get Elder\" or \"hard lose drake advantage, stall and then rush or steal elder\". I mean, that's a pretty shitty condition to meet.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GigglesO","date":"2020-01-14T18:39:37.104+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whats late game?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2020-01-14T23:18:25.165+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I like how people look at this and think \"Wow, what a mission to have because of our shitty game state\", instead of \"Wow, what a shitty mission to have in our games.\" The mission was changed because Elder Dragon isn't supposed to be something that people get regularly, and is doubly bad since teams most likely to get Elder Dragon are the teams that are already winning and far ahead, meaning it's far more likely for them to end before seeing it. \n\nIt'd be no different than making a mission that says get 300 CS in a single game.
