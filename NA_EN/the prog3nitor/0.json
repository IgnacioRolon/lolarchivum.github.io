A down voted comment by a rioter? I wonder wh-\r\n\r\nhttp://prntscr.com/kpgfwk\r\n\r\n**ExcuseMeWhatTheFuck?**\r\n\r\nOh yeah I&#039;m gonna be asking fucking questions!\r\n\r\nWhat intellectual titan thought it was a good idea to openly discriminate against men, who mind you are the majority of your player base, to somehow solve the problems at your company? As if it would somehow balance out the companies despicable acts by taking it out on the player base who had nothing to do with this?\r\n\r\nAre you mad? How could a room of rational people sit in the same room and listen to someone say &#039;Let&#039;s discriminate against men&#039; and think. &#039;&#039;Whoa! That&#039;s a brilliant idea that won&#039;t backfire at all,~~ It&#039;s not like we just came out of a mass sexism scandal at our company.~~ Let&#039;s do it!&#039;&#039;\r\n\r\nI mean, I don&#039;t want to make assumptions here but...\r\n\r\nThis seems like an obvious attempt to appease the SJW &#039;journalists&#039; and get flak off your backs by alienating the majority of your player base because they were born the wrong way.\r\n\r\nAny other group of people and that room full of &#039;rational&#039; people would have had the person suggesting this fired for discrimination.\r\n\r\nLemme show you.\r\n\r\n&#039;&#039;Let&#039;s exclude black people from our event for the first hour and a half.&#039;&#039; The one mad idiot says. \r\n&#039;&#039;No.&#039;&#039; Replies the rational people. The idiot was fired for racism.\r\n\r\n&#039;&#039;Let&#039;s exclude woman from our event for the first hour and a half.&#039;&#039; The other mad idiot says. \r\n&#039;&#039;No.&#039;&#039; Replies the rational people. The idiot was fired for sexism.\r\n\r\n&#039;&#039;Let&#039;s exclude Asian people from our event for the first hour and a half.&#039;&#039; The next mad idiot says. \r\n&#039;&#039;No.&#039;&#039; Replies the rational people. The idiot was fired for racism.\r\n\r\n&#039;&#039;Let&#039;s exclude trans people from our event for the first hour and a half.&#039;&#039; Another mad idiot says. \r\n&#039;&#039;No.&#039;&#039; Replies the rational people. The idiot was fired for trans-phobia.\r\n\r\n&#039;&#039;Let&#039;s exclude men from our event for the first hour and a half.&#039;&#039; Another mad idiot says.\r\n&#039;&#039;YeS!11!!!&#039;&#039; Replies the same rational people. The idiot faces no repercussions for their actions and the discriminated player-base watch in wonder as how the company could pull something like this after a scandal less than a month before that forced the company to enforce massive change internally.\r\n\r\nSo I want to challenge that same intellectual titan that thought of this idea.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s not my fault I was born male.\r\n**Change my mind.**","replies":[]}
