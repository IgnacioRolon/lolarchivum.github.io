But RIOT has actually been up my ass about my attitude lately and it's actually helped. I got out of bronze, win more games and I am able to stay more positive through peoples negativity.

It's one thing for someone to up and spill a can's worth of domineering whoopass, but if that someone also has a serious attitude problem then it makes the shit get all the worse for the losing side of the map. Unsportsmanlike conduct penalties just ain't good enough to fight over, and it's gonna stay that way for all eternity.
