Even if you have your own mobility, she has it on a passive and will out \"mobility\" anyone else. \n\nPicking a melee champion that uses movement speed to catch their targets that at one time could still work, are just impossible to use right now vs her. In general, MS buffs should out preform dashes/teleports in the long run. But Kalista does not fill this. If you're looking for distance Ghost will get you further than Flash. \n\nWhen Kassadin was at a 90% ban rate his existence pushed almost all immobile mages out of the game. Kalistia is doing the same thing. But it's OK because you're not supposed to chase her? \n\nNo one should be impossible to catch like that. Even Kassadin had to pay for his mobility. He couldn't do it forever. And he couldn't continue to attack while doing it unless he used it to close a gap. He's melee and his ranged damage is limited by cooldowns. \n\nAnd how do you figure Kalista is not meant to be chased? ADC's are always a high priority target. Signed is rarely a high priority target. \n\n- Put a cap on her E on monsters.\n- Remove the bonus range when dashing backwards on her passive\n- Lower the slow on her E. \n\nIf too much she can get buffs in other places. \n\n- Increase range on passive when dashing after using her Q.\n- Champions spotted by her W gain double Rend stacks. \n- After her ally lands R, she gains increased passive range when dashing tward them\n- Gains increased range dashing to linked ally. This could also just replace the increased range when going backwards. Meaning if you linked to a tank you're likely not going to kite as well. But if you're with say a Nami, if they can manage to stay behind you, you can kite better.

You try catching her because the second you turn around to run away she changes her plan and instead of dashing away from you, dashes towards you, slowly stacking Rend on you until she's ready to slow & murder you.\n\n\"Don't chase Kalista\" will become an acceptable tip when someone presents an actually good way to deal with her that isn't \"use targeted CC\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raptamei","date":"2015-02-24T17:00:41.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LittleBlast,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=k5zYv0Ju,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-02-24T02:45:27.969+0000)\n>\n> Her sole purpose is to kite. That is what she was designed to be, the insanely kitey adc. Do you chase singed? No. Its just something you dont do. Learn not to try to chase a kalista.

On top of the fact that she does damage from range. If singed wants to do anything but slow you he has to get in melee range. Kalista full build does almost as much damage as any other full build ADC (a lot) but she can just spam and get out of it. On top of that she builds Runaans and BT so she essentially has 40% lifesteal and she builds Frozen Heart so you can't burst her down.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zazusha","date":"2015-02-24T16:14:02.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Singed doesn't carry games, or have an infinity stacking Execution that works as a smite vs drag/baron.","replies":[]}]}
