You win in the long run, since stacking armor early shuts down a Riven with little gold fast. But if she gets a gold advantage early, it's going to spiral out of control 80% of the time.\n\nThe first thing you have to remember about Riven is her insanely strong early game. Specifically, at levels 1-3, you do not want to try to trade unless you can avoid her Broken Wings combo or her Q is on cooldown. Just play relatively safe, and focus on farming safely with autos, and Q if minions are out of reach. Riven has little to no sustain early on, so your Q's will stack up over the course of the farming phase and get you in an advantageous position.\n\nOnce you get some gold, rushing a Randuin's or another good armor item is your ideal choice. With the armor and the health, you both take a lot less damage from Riven and deal a lot to her as well. Don't get cocky, though, since she is powerful with her level 6 power spike. When you yourself hit 6, do your usual thing and look for skirmishes or places where your team could use a some help to ult in. Make sure you are far from Riven or she WILL interrupt it with her CC.\n\nMost champions push Shen to turret due to his slow wave clear, but if you're at turret and know how to CS well, you have the advantage. Just try to keep the wave from pushing too hard if you can. If you have a large minion wave on your side, use it to your advantage by taunting Riven and leading her to the wave. Most of the time, since she is squishy, she will take considerable damage from the aggro and your Ki strike.\n\nYour ultimate is your best friend for when Riven roams. If she ganks mid or bot, or even gets the jump on your jungler, you can stop her in her tracks with a quick ultimate and dash. If done correctly, you should enjoy a free amount of gold for your troubles.\n\nAs Shen, you usually have to help other lanes by using Stand United, so your presence in top lane can be non-existent at times. Many times, you sacrifice top lane for a bot lane gank, or a mid lane gank. Sometimes you get your team kills, sometimes you get objectives like dragon or turrets, sometimes you don't get anything. It's a risk that must be taken. And although Riven might smile devilishly and take out the turret at top lane, you can feel good about being able to taunt her when she goes in on your squishies.\n\nAlso, a quick tip. Since the Riven ultimate nerf, her projectile speed has been reduced. If you find yourself at the mercy of a Riven about to execute you with Wind Slash, you can dash laterally or out of its range easily. The dash is key to trading as well, since interrupting Riven's combo is the key to shutting her down.\n\nSorry for the giant text wall. Just wanted to help a fellow Shen player out. Good luck on the Rift!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lowvyr","date":"2015-06-04T03:40:39.227+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Qataan,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=MuZq0TiM,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2015-06-03T16:32:17.721+0000)\n>\n> First, I am thankfult that you started this thread. \n> \n> I like to play as Shen up top, but the one I've had trouble against most is Riven, as she pushes me all the way back to under my turret.\n\nBiggest tip: Don't die. One death will be the end of that lane. Easier said than done, though.\n\nIf you're playing a tanky champion (I.E. Shen, Shyv, Nasus*, Garen, Renek, etc.), you can be more aggressive with her, because you'll be able to take her damage. \nNasus is a special case, however. Until 6, you can't do anything to her except wait until her combo is down and then WEQ her, and run away with your tail down. Farm under turret, hit 6, get Frozen Heart, crush her face. Post 6 you (Hopefully) be too tanky for her, so long as you didn't die.\n\nYou can't die to her, or she will spiral out of control on you. Try to bait out her abilities and punish her when they are down. If she Es towards you, run you have a small amount of time to escape before she actually gets onto your face and slashes you to bits. Try not to take too much harass from her early, and if you have a long range poking ability (Panth, Maokai, Jayce, etc.), poke her to death with it, but make sure that you stay away from her when it's on CD so that she won't jump you and kill you. If you can poke her down enough and keep her out of lane long enough to get a good lead on her, push her to tower to keep her from roaming.\n\nIf you do happen to die to her, be careful of her roaming or constantly killing you. If you die, get some ganks on her, but make sure that you both can actually fight her so she doesn't just kill you both and get even farther ahead. Try to lock her down and burst her quickly before she can cast Blade of the Exile, as she will become extremely deadly when she does, and if she has a Vampiric Scepter or, even worse, a Hydra, she will have enough lifesteal to sustain through your damage.\n\nIf she gets first picked, and you're going to lane against her, consider some of her hard counters. Garen is arguably the best against her due to his innate tankiness and sustain, not to mention his point and click silence that has no cost, is on a very low cd, lasts for god damn ever AND counts as AA with a very high base damage and scaling. He can sustain through her damage, and once he gets a couple defensive items will be far too tanky for her to kill while actually doing enough damage and silencing her for long enough to kill her. Renekton is also very good against her. He may as well be just as good as a counter as Garen if not better against her. He is too tanky, has an aa reseting on hit stun, two dashes, and a crazy AoE in lane heal. He can dash through the minion wave, stun her aa q and then dash back out through the minion taking little to no damage from her, while taking a large chunk of her health. He builds as a tanky bruiser, allowing him to sustain through her damage (He builds a Hydra), and dealing enough damage to rip through her. His ultimate makes him excessively difficult to gank as, with it up, he is more than capable of coming out of a 1v2 without taking a scratch. These two are more than good against her, it's probably the hardest counter in the history of league. She just can not do anything against them. Pantheon and Jayce are also very good against her, but not on the same level as Garen and Renekton.\n\nYou mentioned Shen, so I'll help you with that matchup.\nYou're tanky, or you should be. Most of the time if I'm playing Riven and get beat by a Shen, he maxed Q first. I don't know if this actually helps against her, as I'm not very familiar with what his Q does, but it does seem to be a common theme against Rivens as Shen. Let her push you. Freeze right in front of your turret, and then taunt her under your turret if she tries to dive you or even poke you. She'll take a lot of damage if not die straight away due to turret damage. You don't really counter her, and she doesn't really counter you. It's a skill matchup. Try to shield though her damage and DO NOT taunt her right after she uses abilities, as she will get free damage off on you with her passive. Keep her info opened in the top left to see if she has passive stacks. If she does, do not taunt her until they go away or you are under your turret. This matchup isn't that hard for you, if you play smartly and ask for some early ganks. Other than that, I don't really know that much about this matchup, because I don't usually get put into it.\n\nRiven is highly capable of blowing up a squishy before your team can react in a teamfight with a mix of flash and her high damage. She is built to deal damage and move around quickly. She has 4 dashes (3 on her Q, and her E). Her E is on a very low CD, making her deceptively tanky with the shield that scales off AD. Armor is not too helpful, although it helps. She builds some armor pen, so some of your armor is useless, but it will definitely help. Building a Frozen Heart against her really kills her damage. In lane, try to build one as fast as you can. Don't duel her too much, as her damage will just keep coming and will most likely be too much for you to handle.\n\nAgain, biggest tip: DON'T DIE.\n\nHope I helped in anyway","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2015-06-03T01:40:37.153+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shaco.\n\nMotherfucking Shaco.\n\nI need tips around him.","replies":[{"poster":"Pæan","date":"2015-06-03T08:26:37.975+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can actually help someone! :D\n\nEarly game do not, i repeat, do not try to fight him if you know he has a box down.

I'd like to go into more detail.\n\nThe key to beating a Yasuo in lane is proper minion management, and proper management is different depending on whether you're a ranged or melee champion. As a ranged champion, you want to keep the wave in 1 of 2 places depending on Yasuo's health relative to yours. If Yasuo is ahead or even, you want to keep the wave frozen a bit outside of your own tower, so that he has to go into tower range to order to hit you. You can basically do whatever you want to him if the wave is in this spot because you can simply retreat into tower range if he tries to go onto you. However, if you're ahead of him in health, you want to start a slow push, so you can poke him whenever he tries to CS and you'll have a buffer of minion support if he tries to all in you. In this case, he can't do much either. \n\nFor a melee champion, you want to slow push pretty much all the time. Yasuo is extremely vulnerable to being all inned by melee champions when he's trying to CS, and a good Yasuo will try to do a slow push of his own to discourage his opponent from attacking him. One important thing to understand is that while enemy minions are oftentimes Yasuo's best friends since he uses them to dash, they are also one of his biggest weaknesses since he's required to tank them in order to trade. If you can bait him into tanking alot of minions with some kind of defensive ability like an ori shield, you can very easily come out ahead in trades, provided you don't panic, keep autoing, and hit some extra free damage on him when he tries to get out.\n\nGenerally speaking, a Yasuo will always want the wave in 1 of 2 places. He either wants a slight minion advantage on his side so he can get free opportunities to poke with Q, but not so many more minions that the wave gets frozen outside the enemy tower. A good Yasuo will bait you into hitting minions with AOE abilities to push the wave back towards him if it starts to get too close to tower, allowing him to be aggressive again. The other position is for when Yasuo has a lead on his opponent; he will want to freeze outside of his tower, leaving a long trail of minions to dash through so he can all in you if you try to walk up to CS. The key to beating Yasuo is to keep the wave where you want it to be rather than the way he wants it to be, or there's not a whole lot you can do as alot of champions.\n\nOther general tips for beating Yasuo include: Ask for ganks, an aggressive Yasuo player is very easy to bait and kill if he isn't strong enough to 1v2 already. Take exhaust as a combat summoner if your kill pressure on him is low, its a great way to neutralize his aggression in lane as well as neuter him in teamfights. If Yasuo misses his tornado, that is the time to be aggressive. His Q is on CD, he has no CC for a while, and his ult, by extension, is unavailable. And if Yasuo gets too aggressive in lane and messes up when trying to trade, all in him right then and there. If you get a lead against Yasuo, most champions will be able to zone him out heavily since he's a squishy melee only champion with no escape and no natural sustain.\n\nAnd 1 final tip that almost no one knows about. Yasuo's ult is a suspension and not a knockup, which means it can be removed with QSS, Mikaels, Cleanse, Gangplanks orange, and Olaf's and Alistars ult. If you remove it, you can move immediately and will take no damage, but Yasuo will still be stuck in his ult animation until it is finished.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Daetnas","date":"2015-06-03T11:58:05.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always struggle against Brand.

Against Brand, you usually just want to (of course) dodge his skillshots and wait until he uses his W or E (which he normally uses for farming waves).

Of course, ganks, but you always have to be careful not to stand too close together, as that will hurt. \n3. Always be aware of his early game damage (especially at level 1, since his passive gives him like +40 base damage).\n4. In trades, try to have minions in between you and him, so that he can't stun you.\n5. Stay away from ignited minions.\n\nAs Anivia, you generally want to turn it into a farm fest, as you clearly outscale him. You can just clear the waves with your ult post-6 if you get blue.

A few helpful hints:\n\nVOLI:\n-when ganked or teamfighting against Volibear post 6, move away from your minions or allies (and to safety). It's been mentioned that volibear is easily kited and this is true. However i find I can still do a lot of damage with my ult chaining off minions even if I can't catch up to you. often times its enough to secure a kill.\n\n- Keep track of flash. Volibear's flash q is very hard to escape from and adds a lot of anti-kiting potential. same with righteous glory cd if he has one. \n\n- Late game, even with ult, volibear's damage drops off HARD on his own if you are full health and reasonably tanky. His biggest source of damage late game is his w (bite) which is percent missing health (an execute). Voli struggles late game to take down other tanky champions alone. In a teamfight late game, It's usually more beneficial for me as voli to just peel the carries instead of initiating (though I often save my ult when doing so). \n\nOLAF: \n\nLane Olaf:\n\n-ranged champions work better, but don't rely too heavily on a ranged CC champ like lissandra...olaf is the bane of their existence. a top lane ahri or LB or vayne would probably work. Also champions that stack health while simultaneously have ranged harass like mundo work well too. I've had trouble against Vlad's too.\n\n-trade outside of his E range if possible. This is where Olaf does the most damage.  He relies heavily on Autos to sustain and to refresh his E CD. \n\n-gankable pre-6.  I struggle if I get ganked a lot. \n\n-Olaf in lane is generally mana hungry early game, especially if he has to use his Q to farm. Use this to your advantage; Manaless Olaf can always use E to trade but if he is low enough this will hurt him more than it hurts you and you can usually get a kill. \n\nJUNGLE OLAF:\n\n-I hate getting counterjungled. Nunu is probably the best counter i can think of; a slow, AS slow, outsmiteability, and zoning for your carries. \n\n-Again, someone who stacks health works well against him.\n\n-Olaf's best ganks are around tri-bushes and lane ganks when you are pushed, as he doesn't have a lot of initiation potential, so keep those areas warded. \n\n-Kite his ult, or bait him into burning it. He gains a ton of AD and is immune to CC. In this sense, sivir is an excellent pick; she doesn't rely on CC to kite or peel away, plus her spell shield can stop an ax or true damage strike. \n\n-As a tank, don't stand still. make him work to get his autos in; move, AA, move, AA. \n\nHope this helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Baron of Bread","date":"2015-06-03T23:12:28.152+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"HUEHUEHUE\n\nMorde can be a bit of a pain to deal with.  As terkmc said, stay out of your minions.  Morde wants to hit as much stuff as possible with his abilities, and if you make it easy for him to include you in that then you will have a bad day.  However, before he gets his Hextech Revolver he has no easy way to get health back.  His health regen is currently crap, so if you ever see him with low/no shield up then take the opportunity to hit him _if you can do so without getting hit first_.  He will slowly kill himself in lane and if you can get a jungle gank before he can get his Revolver you can easily win the lane.\n\nOnce you are out of the lane fighting him is a bad idea (unless he didn't do well in lane, then he is free kills).  Even if he is 0/0/0 or worse, make sure you check his items and cs before jumping on him because Morde can effectively be fed because of how well he farms.  Morde can't fight you unless you let him since he has no cc and his only speed boost is towards an ally.  If you do plan to fight Morde, he is kite-able.  If you can't kite, then avoid fighting him in your minion wave; they are just walking health packs to him.  Don't try to fight him alone, he is a pretty strong duelist with his Q and his ult.  If you have two people to kill him, make sure neither of them is squishy or he will burst the squishy and use their ghost to get the double kill.  If you can get it so you have like one or two minions with you then that is probably optimal if he can't just kill them with one E.  Basically, fighting Morde is not good unless you are significantly stronger than him but you decide if you fight him or not.\n\nIn teamfights Morde is only really a threat if he has a strong engager to hold you in place while he wades in.  If he built full or nearly full damage he needs to die FAST.  His shield helps stop burst, but it only blocks so much when he isn't tanky.  If you can get him before he gets his shield up that's great, but if he throws his Q, E and R early then he will be unable to quickly get his shield/health back for ~3 seconds.  If he built fairly tanky then he can be ignored, he won't do much damage and he has no cc so he isn't really a threat.  Kill his friends and keep whoever he ulted safe.\n\nIn regards to his ghost.  If you can keep the person who he ulted alive, do so as much as possible.  If you are that person and you are likely to die, either get out of there so the ghost is in a bad position for Morde or go down in a blaze of glory.  If his ghost is a tank, no big deal.  If his ghost is an APC, no big deal.  If his ghost is an ADC or similar, this is a big deal.  Morde will heal for 100% of the damage the ghost deals and it will do a lot.  If Morde is low on health, burst-kill him so the ghost goes away (unless he is tanky).  If he is high on health or is tanky then kill the ghost, stopping the healing and damage from it are going to be necessary to actually kill Morde.\n---\nThe ball is impatient\n\nI don't have nearly as much to say about Ori.  However, one big thing to remember with her is that the threat isn't Orianna, the threat is the Ball.  Keep eyes on that thing because it can wreck your day.  It does less damage per thing it goes through (unless she is using Command: Protect), so even if you can't dodge it, try to keep some minions between you and it.  Learn her cooldowns on Command: Attack, once she has moved the Ball with it she can't move it again until the cooldown is off (unless she uses Command: Protect).  Never stand in a line between Ori and the Ball, that lets her use Protect for damage and you don't want that.\n\nOn another note, don't auto-attack trade with Ori.  She gets an AP ratio on autos and she does more damage per auto against the same target.\n\nIf you want to kill Ori, remember that she has a strong shield with Protect.  It is a health and resistance shield so you should respect its durability.  However, it isn't instant.  If you can jump on her when the Ball isn't close by, you can take out most of her health (assuming you have burst) before the Ball gets to her to provide the shield and damage.  If she has the Ball on her it is usually not a good idea to attack because she can easily hit with her full burst, as well as start kiting with the slow/speed up from her Dissonance and the displacement from Shockwave.","replies":[]},{"poster":"terkmc","date":"2015-06-03T18:28:17.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Volibear.

If she casts too many spells she'll be out of juice quick. When i vs an ahri i know that speed farming early can be costly for her. So i starve her out. Try your best to push the wave making her use spells to clear them from her turret. Remember to back off after pushing until the lane resets. All it takes is a gank and a charm for this to go wrong. If done successfully, you'll notice a huge drop in cs compared to you. Which means less gold for her to get items which means 0 damage. Like all assassins, all it takes is one lucky kill steal for her to get back in the race so don't let your guard down as a smart ahri will realize she's being starved and gank another lane post-6. **Ping those mias!**\n\nUnfortunately not all champs can use this strategy so try to counter pick accordingly if you have the option.\n\nGoodluck :D","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-06-04T07:51:43.811+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is alot harder to do that.

She is skillshot reliant. If laning against her I feel the enemies that make me choose between minions or poke when using Q generally give the hardest time. With her relatively recent loss of her damage amp she can't 100 to 0 anyone anymore. She NEEDS the poke in lane to be able to all in you. You've got to think/observe about how she uses Q in order to evade it, even if it's only evading one part of it, it really hurts when both connect. I'd suggest retaliating while her MS boost from Q is down if your harass is a skillshot. Something to watch out for is that if you do get poked down to a level she can all in you, if she knows what she's doing she will flash over minions with a charm for the kill. When she has her passive up be especially sure to not be near minions cause she will Q the next wave for her sustain. If you can try to bait out a spell use from her while her passive is up, she'll lose a lot of sustain. In teamfights I would suggest any from of point and click CC because some Ahris won't hesitate to use ult to evade skillshots but if she decides to initiate her charm range will require her to be in front so your team can collapse on her. Speaking of which DO NOT let her catch you out of position because she will not hesitate to all in a carry if she can get a charm on them, otherwise Ahri's general role in a teamfight is to throw Qs safely from the backline and attempting to charm an important target.","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-06-03T23:47:46.757+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So basically, you have to be better than the enemy Ahri.
