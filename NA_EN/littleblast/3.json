While you are running from Illaoi she's more or less unable to hurt you. She's slow, has no gap closers, all of her damage relies on spawning tentacles around you beforehand, and 3 of four of her abilities have wind-up time.\n\nMost people have trouble with Illaoi's test of spirit, where she steals your soul and beats you up. Other people have problem with Illaois' ultimate. The answer to both of these problems is to move.\n\nWhen Illaoi tries to steal your spirit, just move out of the way. It's not a very fast skillshot, and it is blocked by minions. Alternatively, you can take the skillshot and immediately run before she can do any damage to you, at which point you will be \"cursed\" until you kill three tentacles. But none of those tentacles will hit you as long as you continue to move, so pick a direction and walk, and as long as your not running at a right angle towards any tentacles, you won't take damage. Half the time I actually land the attack, I don't actually do any real damage with it.\n\nWhen she ults, again, just move away. If Illaoi lands a 5 man ult, and those 5 immediately dash away, you can actually avoid every tentacle (though If you don't have a dash, and you're at the epicenter you _will _take damage). Treat her like you would treat a Heimerdinger, Fiddlesticks, or Morgana with Zhonyas: Just walk away. And not even all that far away. If she ults in Dragon pit for instance, you only really have to move_  just outside of the actual dragon pit_ for her to have officially wasted her ultimate. \n\nAs frustrating as moving is for you as her opponent, just understand that Illaoi herself is swearing her ass off with every missed attack","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2016-01-03T23:07:40.338+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"so the counter to a priestess of Nagakabouros is... being in movement?\n\nKinda ironic isn' t it?","replies":[{"poster":"Squidblimp","date":"2016-01-04T01:36:08.258+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not ironic, it's fitting.

I have some major troubles against those ladies.\n\nGenerally avoid her taking her passive dmg when you can because she gets a lot of dmg for it & gets her AS/MS boost, in duo lane in particular you could try to bait her to have the unmarked of two of you try to punish her when she goes to try to proc the it. (Reminder that it reveals you so you can't juke her passive in bushes) \n\nAdditionally because of the predictability of where Vault lands Quinn after, aiming your skillshots at where she lands can be a very efficient tactic that will force to play more passively with the threat of that punishment ie {{champion:89}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:42}} etc can punish vault well in a duo lane when you understand the timing & landing pattern. \n\nAlso you can try to shove her in because this force her to use Q for wave clear rather than trades/poke & will oom her fairly quickly in early to mid game & will force her to stay in lane or missing experience/gold for her roam, since letting her pressure your lane in & roam for is something you want to prevent as best you can for the sake of your team.\n\nRemember she doesn't get the same lvl6 power spike of most champions, so if you can all in her at lvl6 if you're both even you should be able to come out ahead if you make good use of your ult. \n\nLastly & mostly importantly if Quinn is a head of you & you don't know if something is warded or not & you lack vision, then you need to very careful being alone or ideally don't be alone if she's ahead of you, Quinn with her ult can snowball very hard off of making picks on players who aren't considering they might be on a ward & Quinn is coming to them...\nEspecially if she went {{item:3142}} and/or is lvl 11/16 with a zeal item done, often I am able to snowball often because I catch people who aren't respecting her ult & her teams vision. Additionally make sure you recall somewhere actually safe when you're low since her ult channel time is less than the recall channel time, if you try in a risky spot, she'll probably finish you.\n\nHopefully you found this helpful.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Miku Lv99","date":"2016-01-03T05:06:13.774+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I struggle to face Yasuo.

And Brand right now but that's probably just because he's OP right now.\n\nThere are a few tips that people already know about facing a Yasuo; poke his shield off with autos, he's weakest right after his tornado is gone, and he's weak to ganks. I'd like to go into more detail.\n\nThe key to beating a Yasuo in lane is proper minion management, and proper management is different depending on whether you're a ranged or melee champion. As a ranged champion, you want to keep the wave in 1 of 2 places depending on Yasuo's health relative to yours. If Yasuo is ahead or even, you want to keep the wave frozen a bit outside of your own tower, so that he has to go into tower range to order to hit you. You can basically do whatever you want to him if the wave is in this spot because you can simply retreat into tower range if he tries to go onto you. However, if you're ahead of him in health, you want to start a slow push, so you can poke him whenever he tries to CS and you'll have a buffer of minion support if he tries to all in you. In this case, he can't do much either. Also, as a ranged champion, the very first thing you want to do at the start of every game is show up to lane early, run up past your creeps, and auto off his shield for free before he gets in dash range of any of your minions. Be sure to do this whenever he gives you the opportunity to hit him without being in immediate dash range of you or your creeps. Yasuo is enormously reliant on his shield to soak damage when closing on ranged champions and you should knock if off for free whenever he gives you the opportunity.\n\nFor a melee champion, you want to slow push pretty much all the time. Yasuo is extremely vulnerable to being all inned by melee champions when he's trying to CS, and a good Yasuo will try to do a slow push of his own to discourage his opponent from attacking him. One important thing to understand is that while enemy minions are oftentimes Yasuo's best friends since he uses them to dash, they are also one of his biggest weaknesses since he's required to tank them in order to trade. If you can bait him into tanking alot of minions with some kind of defensive ability like an ori shield, you can very easily come out ahead in trades, provided you don't panic, keep autoing, and hit some extra free damage on him when he tries to get out.\n\nGenerally speaking, a Yasuo will always want the wave in 1 of 2 places. He either wants a slight minion advantage on his side so he can get free opportunities to poke with Q, but not so many more minions that the wave gets frozen outside the enemy tower. A good Yasuo will bait you into hitting minions with AOE abilities to push the wave back towards him if it starts to get too close to tower, allowing him to be aggressive again. The other position is for when Yasuo has a lead on his opponent; he will want to freeze outside of his tower, leaving a long trail of minions to dash through so he can all in you if you try to walk up to CS. The key to beating Yasuo is to keep the wave where you want it to be rather than the way he wants it to be, or there's not a whole lot you can do as alot of champions.\n\nOther general tips for beating Yasuo include: Ask for ganks, an aggressive Yasuo player is very easy to bait and kill if he isn't strong enough to 1v2 already. Take exhaust as a combat summoner if your kill pressure on him is low, its a great way to neutralize his aggression in lane as well as neuter him in teamfights. If Yasuo misses his tornado, that is the time to be aggressive. His Q is on CD, he has no CC for a while, and his ult, by extension, is unavailable. And if Yasuo gets too aggressive in lane and messes up when trying to trade, all in him right then and there. If you get a lead against Yasuo, most champions will be able to zone him out heavily since he's a squishy melee only champion with no escape and no natural sustain.\n\nAnd 1 final tip that almost no one knows about. Yasuo's ult is a suspension and not a knockup, which means it can be removed with QSS, Mikaels, Cleanse, Gangplanks orange, and Olaf's and Alistars ult. If you remove it, you can move immediately and will take no damage, but Yasuo will still be stuck in his ult animation until it is finished.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-01-03T16:12:15.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If people ask for counter champions, tanks with hard CC or bruisers are great for ruining his day (as long as they don't have skill shots). \n\nMy personal favorite counter is Nautilus.

Champs that scale offensively with defensive stats are the hardest counter to him. Think Malphite, Mundo, Rammus, Taric, etc. He literally cannot deal with those champions 1v1 beyond the first few levels unless he's way, way, way ahead. However, I think focusing on counterpicks is wrong because it still leaves you feeling helpless whenever you can't counterpick him. All the advice I gave omits specific champions for that very reason; the tips I have are relevant no matter who you're playing. At this point, Yasuo doesn't really counter anyone. All of his matchups are either skill matchups or counterpicks to Yasuo; that's the price he pays for having a kit that focuses so heavily on outplay mechanics.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2016-01-03T05:41:29.675+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:150}} is my bane.

I've got 174K mastery points with Riven, so here is what I struggle with playing as her.\n\n1) Her ability cooldowns are all really long early, Q has a base CD of 13 and is NOT reduced by putting points in the skill. If she uses her skills to push the wave, go in and trade with her before they come back up.\n\n2) The cooldown of Q starts as soon as Riven uses the first one, not when she uses the last. If you see a Riven spacing out her Qs, she is trying to either bait you into fighting her or is about to engage. Be careful, as the CD of Q early will only be 3-4 seconds when she does this.\n\n3) Her sustain is awful. Even with the recent buff, her HP per 5 is still among the worst. Any champion with good sustain (Garen, Renekton) or with decent poke (Gnar, Jayce) do fairly well against her. You mentioned she beat your Renekton. The best way to win that matchup is short trades with your stun, then healing off your Q.\n\n4) Riven's ultimate increases her bonus AD by 20%. DO NOT fight Riven unless you vastly outnumber or know you can beat her with ult active. \n\n5) Her 4 dashes make escaping a gank fairly easy. However, if you can use a displacement (Lee Sin ult or Quinn E) it will cancel that Qs movement. Also, if you can stun her for 3-4 seconds her Q duration will run out and she won't be able to use the charges she has left.\n\n6) A large portion of her early damage comes from her passive, which enhances her autos after using a skill. (stacks 3 times) However, this buff has a short duration so waiting it out is the best idea.\n\n7) IF Riven kills you in lane, or is in any way ahead, DO NOT BUILD DAMAGE. It is super easy to win lane when the enemy Gnar or Renekton build Black Cleaver or another damage item after you kill them. Build Armor, usually a Dead Man's or Sunfire is your best bet. \n\n8) Riven struggles with bruisers and tanks. Her damage is all AD, and current HP items like BORK or not that useful since she is more ability based than auto attack reliant. Stacking HP and Armor will make it a lot harder for Riven to duel you.\n\n9) Riven is balanced around her animation cancels. If the enemy Riven struggles with these, it will be a lot easier to trade with her.\n\n10) Be wary of Riven mid-game. Most Rivens will attempt to max out their CDR by this point, putting her abilities are fairly low cooldowns. \n\n11) Her shield, while strong, only lasts 1.5 seconds. Bait it out and then blow your combo and Riven will take way more damage than if she had it.\n\nChampions Riven struggles against:\n{{champion:86}}: His silence makes trading her super easy, and he can just win through sustain with his passive.  \n\n{{champion:58}}: The stun helps him win trades, and the heal on his Q allows him to out sustain her. \n\n{{champion:126}}: His hammer E keeps Riven off him while he pokes with auto attacks and empowered Qs. \n\n{{champion:133}}: Quinn's E will outright cancel Riven's 3rd Q and push her away. Along with that, just poking Riven down with autos makes winning lane nearly impossible. NOTE: If Riven gets ahead in this matchup, she will burst Quinn down faster than Quinn can get away.\n\n{{champion:150}}: Like Quinn, his poke allows him to out trade her plus the bonus tank stats  and CC of Mega Gnar means Riven can't fight him in his melee form either. HOWEVER, like Quinn, Gnar's low base armor and HP makes it easy for Riven to burst down his mini form if she gets on top of him.\n\nChampions Riven excels against:\n{{champion:75}}: Riven has 4 dashes, slows do nothing. She easily out trades him and can just bully him out of lane.\n\n{{champion:420}}: All of Illoai's skills are extremely slow and easy do dodge with Riven's E or Q. Riven damage also allows her to bully Illoai out of lane.\n\n{{champion:17}}: Riven being ability based rather than auto attack reliant, this guy is a free kill.\n\n{{champion:8}}: You'd think due to his built in sustain, and Riven's lack of it, Vlad would stomp this lane. Riven's early damage just shreds through Vlad's crappy early Q heal and will force him to spend health for using W before killing him. \n\n------\nGot anymore questions?

Once he's reached that point and has maybe one offensive item under his belt, he'll have tower shredding potential almost no matter how far behind and will be a pain in your ass if you leave him alone for too long. Your goal is to either shove him under tower and roam mid/bot/counter jungle with your Jungler, or make sure you have the tools to repel him indefinitely away from a tower by the time he has leveled up his ultimate a second time (Level 11).\n\nTrundle excels in most top lane trades thanks to the AD steal and his relatively long range passive, allowing him to stat check the hell out of the majority of top laners and safely sustain through past damage even without needing to be actively up front in lane. Ergo, stop fighting him. Unless you are some sort of early game AP stat checking god, or Lissandra, you really will not benefit at the end of the day if the Trundle knows when and how long he can afford trades. He does however suck _ass_ at wave clear in the early points of the game. This makes it tremendously easy to shove him in, and gives you a lot of time to roam if you time your minion freeze then shove correctly. The key to beating Trundle is abusing his weakness early game; this does not mean that _Trundle_ is weak early game, but his biggest weakness exists the most in the early game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SH Azykan","date":"2016-01-03T22:13:05.347+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"depends on who you are playing.

Because QSS active gives you back your stats when he ults and Q's you.  Gives you a way better chance of being able to fight him. He still has the added stats from you, but having your own back makes his essentially just a steroid and can severely cripple his damage towards you.  or just play rumble...because him removing Ad doesn't matter when Flamespitter still eats his face :)\n\n(also Malphite and Ryze do AMAZING into him, I have never seen a trundle not feed a ryze top, just once ryze hits 6 its gg for him)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"insaiyanbacca","date":"2016-01-04T17:28:09.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:117}} like seriously how do i deal with this thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Athenes Lulu","date":"2016-01-05T08:13:57.716+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"WHOA FINALLY IM ACTUALLY NEEDED :^^^^))))))))))))\n\nIn general, pick anything that can outsustain her or poke harder than she does.\n\n-----------\n\nFor top, you may want to pick a bruiser with a gapcloser AND hard cc. Tanky enough to withstand her poke, and tough enough to 100-0 her easily. If she is bullying you really hard at early levels, play safe, keep calm, keep farming, and ask for jungler ganks whenever possible. Rush MR so she will tickle you later on (since her damage is more focused on earlygame). Just as long you can farm and be useful later on, her point of being the \"lane bully\" will be redeemed useless. {{champion:24}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:421}} = good examples.\n\nFor mid, pick a mage that outranges her, can easily 100-0 from safety, and/or outscale her support-level scalings. Like top, you either play super safe, or poke super hard. Literally any mage that is medium to long ranged works. **DO NOT PICK ASSASSINS, she will make your laning a living hell.** However, if you have no choice and have to face her as an assassin, roam as much as you can, and get early MR if you want to farm for a while. {{champion:45}} is actually one of her worst counters btw.\n\nIn teamfights? Since 95% of Lulu top/mid players go full-AP build, just get one MR item and remove her from her team. Because she is now the enemy team's second support, you should give her the \"RPG healer\" treatment; CC her, kill her carries, then kill her. If she is doing damage, kill her first. If someone is diving, spread out so she can't land a good ult. If someone is getting caught and if she is in range, DON'T bunch, because she can turn failed grabs into a deadly \"grab the Amumu\" trick.\n\n-------------------------\n\nFor support, she will either play like she's a Lulu mid/top player, or an actual support like Janna/Nami. If she plays like she's pretending to be mid/top then it will be VERY easy and predictable. Good Lulu supports will turn botlane into a really annoying lane. Because there's too many ways to play Lulu, I'll put up a general breakdown.\n\n##In lane:\n\n* If she places a shield on someone, don't engage, or hide behind something when possible. This buff not only gives her a shield, but also an AA buff to the ally. Unlike Janna's shield, the AA buff would still be there even if the shield is destroyed (I mean think about it, Pix is still there), so be careful. Also, she may land really tricky glitterlances right upon shielding, so be prepared to dodge.\n* **Bait her W, seriously.** In a solo lane it isn't as important to Lulu because she's more focused on poke there, but botlane, it is THE non-ultimate disable that screws anyone over. It has a 16 second CD at rank one, and somehow they don't max it despite being such a powerful spell. Beat her up if she ever misuses her W.\n* Because Lulu needs all 3 of her spells to do something and make cheesy plays botlane, try to get a lead before she reaches level 3.\n* Got a lockdown? Good idea to focus her instead of her ADC. If you focus her ADC her polymorph will screw up your engage, and her shield + her ADC can turn that into a nasty comeback. I have purposely \"baited\" the enemy botlane into focusing me, my ADC started shooting shit, and got a double kill before. This means, **do this only when you can kill her 100%**.\n* If her ult is up, be prepared for her to use it on someone, especially if someone is close to dying. If you are focusing someone, don't bunch on that person, that is literally a free ult for her, and can turn the entire fight around.\n* Because it is a LOT harder for Lulu to peel botlane, she is a lot easier to gank. Ganking Lulu becomes a lot easier when the support can lock someone down.\n* Anyone against Lulu support works, just as long you can 1) have tons of damage whether if it's for extreme all-ins or just poke and/or 2) heal so much that her poke is pointless. Easy as that.\n\n##Teamfights:\n\nSimilar to Lulu top/mid, but is usually more peel-oriented.\n\n* Since she will be more likely to hide in the backlines, you're not going to have an easy time trying to fish her out. But if she DOES get in range and if your team can 100-0 her, kill her ASAP.\n* Sometimes Lulu will purposely get caught to bait her teammates. Catch Lulu only when she's alone, or when her teammates are unable to fight.\n* **DO NOT dive alone**, unless you can get out cleanly (doesn't happen often unless she is someone like me who has the reaction time of a potato). No, seriously, I have turned so many games around simply because some random enemy idiot went alone and think he can 100-0 someone, then made the entire rest of the 5 minutes a 4v5. Bring in at least ONE person with you and Lulu will have a harder time to stop someone.\n* Don't chase a Lulu unless you know how to kill her ASAP and/or if she is OOM. She has the self-peel of a Janna's. I mean, you can't really catch a Janna; Lulu is just like that.\n* **DO CC Lulu, but DO NOT waste your important spells on her.** If you are going to waste all of your important spells on her, bad news, you just got baited *so* hard. I also have won teamfights where I died because I ate 3 ults and 2 summoners, but my teammates cleaned up because they don't have to deal with those \"important spells\" anymore, and start killing shit. Though Lulu may have a near-Teemo-level global taunt, don't do it. Good Lulu supports will build tank instead of AP so she can bait AND get out alive.\n\n---------------------\n\nSorry, super long post, but hope I helped.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MAestRIO1989","date":"2016-01-03T18:21:44.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a few champions I just, don't like laning against at all:\n{{champion:23}} I can't really tell what it is.

Mal is just a farm game till you got lota of armour, eventually allowing you to flat out 1v1 him. Singed on the other hand has it a bit tougher early on but you'll get to a point where tryndy won't be able to chase. The key to both match ups is that tryndy's E(slows and reduces AD) doesn't affect your dmg output in either match-up(well it does a lil as mal) and both preying on tryndy's weaknesses.\nmal-slows attack speed and move speed(tryndy has 1 gap closer and relies on AA) and naturally builds Frozen heart which also slows attack speed.\nSinged-with rylais will kite indefinitely by combining this with his ult(speed boost) and W(slow puddle), tryndy will be useless unless you stand still.\n\n\nAs for Diana I personally don't have a solution, as you said she isn't picked all that often so perhaps practising against a friend who plays diana may help you improve against her. However to save you from scrolling through comments to find a solution I found this by RefurbishedIce a bit high up. He goes through where her dmg actually comes from and explains different stages in dealing with her.\nALL  CREDIT GOES TO \"RefurbishedIce\" everything until vlad ain't my knowledge\n**Hi, Tips for Diana, not a Diana main but 95k points at Silver III should be fine :P.\n**\n**Diana's burst comes from her passive (Moonsilver Blade), her Q (Crescent Strike), her W (Pale Cascade), and her R (Lunar Rush). Her E just allows her to be a bit more sticky, so if you can shadow out, the ability is pretty much useless.**\n**\nMy suggestion to you is to keep on harassing her with poke abilities, and force her to use Pale Cascade in a suboptimal manner aka negating ranged harass, while simultaneously dodging her Q. To dodge, you should walk to her left, since the arc always curves from her right hand. If she uses the tip of the Q to poke, also walk a distance toward her. Diana's early laning is lackluster because she is extremely mana hungry due to the high mana costs on Pale Cascade.**\n**\nEverything changes when she reaches Level 6 though, her ulti resets if you are tagged by Moonlight (hit by Diana's Q). And she becomes relatively sticky to her target once she lands that Q. Keep in mind that Moonlight lasts for 3 seconds and reveals you for the duration. It is IMPERATIVE that you dodge the Q. That way she can't double ult you to pieces. The cooldown on Lunar Rush is fairly short too at 25/20/15.**\n**\nAnother thing about Diana, is that once she goes in for a fight, she has no way out. Her shield from Pale Cascade only lasts for so long in a teamfight and she will either die or be forced to Zhonya's. Treat her like a Vi, with less tank, but more burst.**\n**\nDon't get Moonsilver Bladed by Diana either. I once killed TF accidentally because I was 400 health, he was full and I missed my combo. I said fuck it, I'll just auto to the end. Moonsilver Blade with Lich Bane cleaved him for 1600 damage. (I was fed as fuck too but whatever) You can tell when she is ready for the big dun dun dun dunnnn auto when she starts glowing. It's every third auto. You can also flash out of the AoE effect. Weird but true.**\n**\nShe also falls off when everyone is full build, because only 3 damaging abilities QQ.**\n\nAs for vlad I don't necessarily destroy him as Zac and mundo, but to this day they're the 2 champs who haven't let me down against this blood sucking tick. Pre level 9 its a farm fest, abusing zacs passive to survive and farming from range as mundo. It's slow but you wont feed, loose your tower and with most vlads hard shoving you under tower(both these champs farm pretty well in this situation) your pretty safe from ganks, spesh as zac(passive revive). At level 9 however( the point at which zac maxes q and I think mundo's are maxing e now) you begin to heavily out trade him due to stupidly high base damage. You may be able to get something done post 6 but pre9 as mundo however I tend to wait just so I'm comfortable in the dmg I know I'm dealing. As zac post9 I just yolo jump in q w and he pools away in fear(vlad pool costs allot of HP) and I come out ahead(as zac max rqew). Rush visage and happy camping.\n\nAs vlad I've been wrecked hard by olaf. His poke really hurts and the lower he gets the stronger he gets. A vlad struggles in this match-up early and an aggressive olaf, full ad marks+quints with ignite will make vlads time a misery. At 6 killing vlad becomes a breeze.\nHopefully it helps and glhf bae","replies":[{"poster":"MAestRIO1989","date":"2016-01-04T13:11:30.501+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the response! _0_\n\nI'll try mastering Olaf some more for Vlad.
