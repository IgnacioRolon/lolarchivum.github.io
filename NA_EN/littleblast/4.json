In an actual 5v5 where the jungler is your friend, the jungler can tell the other lanes to play conservatively while he camps yours to deny the enemy laner farm.\n\nIt's a tough call, since in solo queue if you deviate from build paths for any reason you get spammed with reports.","replies":[{"poster":"Sozan5","date":"2015-03-04T08:38:31.783+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=scrimbul,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ie4ygGEA,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-03-03T22:14:46.345+0000)\n>\n>AND the money lost from building tank stats\n\nThis is just wrong. Money spent on tank stats is not a wasted money - especially if you play champion like Gnar, whose scalings are somewhat underwhelming (Mini-Q: 115%, Mega-Q: 120%, Mega-W: 100%, R: 20% Bonus AD (increses by half if you hit a wall)). Really, outside of his Mega-Q his abilities scale terrible (especially ultimate - you know how much Bonus AD you need in order to increase his ultimate damage by half? Exactly 1 000 bonus AD - Lee for comparison needs 150 bonus AD) and he even have 1 Health scaling ability which further increases the effectivness of tank stats on Gnar.\n\nAlso, important fact - having lower damage output but surviving long enough to deal it is better than having higher damage output but dying before you can deal it. You need to find a perfect balance here - and no, it doesn't mean that Tank stats are wasted, they are just as needed as offensive stats.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KragusIII","date":"2015-03-03T22:30:57.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"BakedLotion","date":"2015-03-03T22:39:10.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KragusIII,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ie4ygGEA,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-03-03T22:30:57.273+0000)\n\n> \n\n\nWe get it.

They whittle your health down while you hug tower and your jungler ignores your lane because \"lol feeder\" then they dive you. You become down 40 cs and 2 kills within 5 minutes, try to farm the jungle so you don't die under your tower again and the jungler comes over to smite the camp and flame you.\n\nYou then have basically two options, try to stay in your lane and be forced to feed or AFK in the river until another lane overextends. Both are likely to get you flamed.\n\nI've also been on the other side where I am up 80 CS and 4 kills extremely early as their entire team flames their laner. And I'm just like... he built tank and I would deal 100% of his health bar while he tried to CS under tower with no jungler help.
