From the ability to prevent/reverse death, to warping dimensional fabrics to reach across the stars, to creating life out of stone, the list goes on. However, there's always danger in using magic, especially against or in conjunction with magics that are their opposites. \r\n\r\nWhen the Ruined King tried to resurrect his wife, he was successful in a way. She did indeed come back to life, but in an exceptionally painful mockery of existence. When he tried to kill himself and her at the same time with a spell, they became the first ghouls of the Shadow Isles and the spell was amplified by hundreds of magical artifacts on the Blessed Isles before the Ruination, causing almost every living being there to become twisted monstrosities in eternal agony.\r\n\r\nWhen Xerath stole Azir's ascension, it caused such a powerful backlash that the entire capital was erased of life and sunk into the desert, not to rise again until millennia later.\r\n\r\nWhen the World Runes were first (re)discovered, a long and deadly war broke out that consumed an untold amount of beings, erasing unprepared cities within seconds of their use, the only thing causing them to be stopped being the fear of their use, and their subsequent concealment.\r\n\r\nThe Void itself seeps into the universe where dimensional fabrics are thin/torn. At first this can be a joyous thing; colorful landscapes and magical creatures of all kinds can develop because of this. However, this eventually sours and starts to corrupt the area, turning anything available into propagating this tear and spreading the Void's influence.\r\n\r\nSo, why should the Champions of League be allowed to haphazardly cast abilities all they want in a small area? Especially with certain champions, shouldn't this cause some sort of backlash eventually? And what would such a backlash be like?\r\n\r\nSay the map of Summoners' Rift was divided into large chunks of area that were directly connected to each other, like a grid but with asymmetrical pieces. Some of these pieces would be much bigger than others, such as Epic Monster Camps and pieces located in the River, while others would be much smaller, like the paths around a Krug Camp. These pieces would react variably to certain events that occur in them.\r\n\r\nAura is the magical energy of each piece of the grid. At game start, each of the pieces' Aura has nothing special about them, and likewise will do nothing. If an ability is cast inside of them, an attribute is given based on what that ability does. Healing abilities will give the Light attribute, Damaging abilities will give the Darkness attribute, Crowd Control abilities will give the Water attribute, terrain creation abilities give the Earth attribute, area-of-effect abilities give the Fire attribute, and movement abilities give the Wind attribute. Aatrox, for example, would generate the Fire attribute on his Q and W, the Wind attribute on his E, and the Water attribute on his Q, W, and R. Because his passive is not a casted ability, it doesn't give an attribute, with the same going for his E's passive. His R only gives a Water attribute because it doesn't directly heal him or damage an enemy champion. Each attribute will slowly decay overtime, but will stop decaying for a short while if another ability is cast inside of their grid piece. Certain map events may also generate attributes, such as the spawning of an Epic Monster or the collection of buffs from certain Large Monsters. If enough of an attribute is collected, that grid piece will begin to passively emit an effect to all non-structure units within it; Light attribute will empower healing abilities as well as very slowly heal units. Darkness attribute will empower damaging abilities as well as very lightly magically damage units. Water attribute empowers crowd control abilities as well as make all units more susceptible to crowd control. Earth attribute will empower terrain creation abilities as well as occasionally generating small bits of terrain in their area that rapidly decay. Fire attribute empowers area-of-effect abilities as well as making units more susceptible to them. Finally, Wind attribute will empower all movement abilities as well as making all units faster. The larger amount of an attribute in a piece, the larger the effect of their Aura Passive until a cap is reached. Multiple attributes can have their passive auras be activated within the same grid piece at the same time, but this runs the risk of Instability, especially if the attributes are opposites.\r\n\r\nInstability occurs when too much magic is found in the aura at a given point, especially if that magic conflicts with each other. As the number of an attribute in a grid piece rises, so does the chance for Instability to be generated in that piece's aura. Should multiple attributes have their aura passive activated in one grid piece, then the chance of Instability generating is multiplied by that amount, but if multiple conflicting attributes have their aura passive activated, such as Light and Darkness, then the chance of Instability generated is quadrupled the number of conflictions as well. Instability acts as a seventh attribute that can't be manually generated. If Instability generates enough to meet the criteria of activating an aura passive, it will instead negate and potentially invert the effects of other aura passives in the same piece, up to a cap. This can be a game changer in teamfights, such as weakening the effects of healing or crowd control abilities or making units less susceptible to area-of-effect attacks or making player-generated terrain decay faster. Instability doesn't decay like other attributes do. If Instability reaches the point where it inverts the effects of other attributes, it will slowly divide it's amount in its grid piece by the number of grid pieces nearby, increasing nearby grid pieces by that amount as well even if spells are being cast. When Instability can no longer invert other attribute effects, it will cause itself and all attributes in its piece to rapidly decay after a somewhat long time of no abilities being cast in that piece. The Baron Nashor and the Elder Drake passively generate Instability just barely enough to prevent complete decay, though this effect grows stronger the longer they are alive.\r\n\r\nCorruption occurs when some foolish people let Instability build up too dense and for too long. The older and more dense Instability has grown in a piece, the bigger the chance for Corruption to occur. When Corruption does occur, that grid piece will slowly damage units with a noxious poison that deals small amounts of true damage as well as periodically spawn weak enemies that grow stronger the more Corruption is in the piece they're in and attack everything except Epic Monsters and afflict those attacked with the same poison. Anything that dies afflicted with this poison becomes a corrupted version of themselves that also attack everything but Epic Monsters. Even towers can be corrupted, but this corruption is different in that attacks from corrupted enemies will not directly damage a tower but instead add a never decaying stack that when reaching a certain number will disable that tower from attacking corrupted entities, though they still are allied with their original team and will attack the opposite team. Corrupted entities can never directly win the game, but instead will make it harder and harder for either side to. Corruption lasts even if an afflicted grid piece is no longer Instable, but can be easily combated by not letting a piece grow unstable again and ensuring that no corrupted entities kill anything, as Corruption will quickly decay if it cannot propagate itself.","replies":[]}
