This happens at least twice a week, some days are better than others, but most often when I can't play League I have no issues whatsoever loading up other games or browsing the web. This last game I missed, I came back to see that post-game chat, and I see in big orange letters - NOT ELIGIBLE FOR REWARDS DUE TO AFK STATUS (or something worded closely) - so now apparently I have a reputation as an AFK'r even after repeatedly trying to connect for 20 minutes.... great..\r\n\r\nThere should be a bit more intelligence behind these punishments, statuses, or reduction in LP, losing promos, etc. from when it is client or server error.  I know Firefox and almost anything Windows can produce a crash report to send for evaluation, why is this not possible with league?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-11T21:58:08.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you connect to a game of League of Legends, you are not simply establishing a connection to the internet.  You have to connect to an individual game server found in Chicago.  If for some reason your computer cannot establish a connection to this server, then you will consistently see an error message instead of the normal Loading Screen.  \n\nThe shitty part is that it's hard to pinpoint exactly why your computer is unable to connect to the server.  To that end, make sure to complete all of the steps found in our [Connection Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664).  It has the most common solutions that should help prevent this from occurring in the future as well as allowing us to rule out some of the most common root causes.\n\nReply back and let me know if you are still experiencing any issues!","replies":[{"poster":"Grey Wolf","date":"2016-05-12T00:47:00.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dArtagnan,\n\nHas Riot seen an uptick in issues since 6.9 went live?  It seems there are many more posts like the OP.  I myself have experienced issued connecting to the game after champ select.  Nothing on my side changed, except patching to 6.9.  Is is possible you guys have a bad build out there?\n\nGW","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-12T22:32:36.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely see where you are coming from. While patches dramatically affect the content in-game, or in the client, it does not affect the network in which your computer attempts to connect to the individual game servers.  It's easy to see a strong correlation to the patch, but it does not mean it is the cause.  To further emphasize this point, we have not seen any increased number of issues on a server wide basis, which we monitor constantly.\n\nGiven this and to clarify, have you had a chance to complete all of the steps in the Connection Article linked above?  There are a ton of steps there, but they are crucial in hopefully resolving this issue!","replies":[{"poster":"Grey Wolf","date":"2016-05-13T00:45:32.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are definitely some issues; who knows where.

The Netalyzr is a 3rd party tool and doesn't connect to Riot or League in any way.  Therefore if you are losing packets to their servers, there is a good chance there is a larger problem.\n\nGiven that amount of packet loss, have you had a chance to contact Frontier at all regarding the packet loss on your connection?  That might be your best next step.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DoubleTap 2K","date":"2016-05-12T09:03:15.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Reply back and let me know if you are still experiencing any issues!\n\nShit yeah hes experiencing issues still!! .... hes INELIGIBLE now xD same here on my main account which i trashed/sell asap Sry!! your own fault... is 6s old and FILLED with skins Rares, Legacies, Legendaries, somer champs i have ALL exisiting skins for o.o but now...
