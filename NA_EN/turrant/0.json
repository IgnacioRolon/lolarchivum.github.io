{"poster":"Turrant","date":"2014-02-26T03:56:01.277+0000","title":"The Great Yordle Unification Pass","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I recall one of the artists talking about them wanting to do a pass on the yordles to bring them together more and create a more cohesive concept about what it means to be a yordle and most likely bringing them so that they were more in line with Lulu and Ziggs.  I believe this was Ironstylus that talked about it.  From my understanding this Great Yordle Unification Pass (GYUP?) is still a ways off and may not be until the end of this year or beginning of next year until it is complete.  With the VU that Heimerdinger now has received on the public beta client I am curious to hear more about what they have decided upon and how the new direction given to Heimer's character model may reflect what will come.   With the VU having come out first for Heimer due to his recent kit rework, what can we expect in regards to the GYUP releases?  Are they going to be coming out as they are ready or is there going to be a sudden influx of Yordle's with new makeup and hairdo's?  The Yordle VU that I am most looking forward to would have to be Tristana with Corki being a close second.  What are you looking forward to working on the most in the GYUP?\r\n\r\nA lot of these questions are directed more specifically @IronStylus or whoever is working on these little guys but I am also interested in hearing more questions or speculations from the community.","replies":[{"poster":"Ququroon","date":"2014-02-26T04:37:19.671+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi! I'm no IronStylus, but I think I can crack at some of this.\n\n>From my understanding this Great Yordle Unification Pass (GYUP?) is still a ways off... \n\nRealistically, it'll be done when it's ready. We still have a bunch of high priority things we need to hit. (Though... hopefully sooner than later, I want more awesome yordles!)\n\n>I am curious to hear more about what they have decided upon and how the new direction given to Heimer's character model may reflect what will come. \n\nHeimerdinger took a bunch of cues from Ziggs, but also built on top of that. We did some studies about Yordles as a whole, so a good amount of his VU was the groundwork for others!","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2014-02-26T05:56:26.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love what you did with the donger Ququroon.

As far as I can tell, males are furry and females aren't, and both of them have kind of a technicolor skin thing going on. The only visible exception to that is Veigar, but it's not glaring because you can't actually see his body.\n\nHowever, there's [real](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peafowl) [life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglerfish) examples of this sort of thing, and the way Yordles have been done in the past, while a little fantastical, is right for the tone of this game.","replies":[{"poster":"AbiwonKenabi","date":"2014-02-26T20:54:11.518+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think the sexual dimorphism(dichromatism?) will go away, but all male and all female Yordles will be brought in line with one another. Personal differences are fine, but since this is it's own species, there at least needs to be some consistencies.\n\nUsing your angler example (quite an extreme one I might add :P) males are always smaller than females, and always latch on. But males aren't just randomly as big as females. Or with Peafowl (think this is considered dichromatism, but your point is understood), the males have varying feather lengths, but they all have showy feathers that are never randomly absent. \n\nNow lets look at Yordles: males are furry, except Heim who has a huge brain-fro thing, and Corki, who has a mustache...? Then the females look like small humans mostly, except Lulu has ears and matches better with the males (more critter-like) and Trist just has human ears....you see what I'm getting at?","replies":[]},{"poster":"PhoenixSlayer13","date":"2014-02-26T18:08:39.423+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I can tell, they're going to keep the sexual dimorphism, since they're using Lulu as the model female yordle.
