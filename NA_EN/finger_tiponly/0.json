So I bought the XP boost, then I bought the ip boost, I played a couple of games then went off. I came back on today to find I only have 1 day and 8 hours left of the ip boost but still 2 days and 7 hours left of the xp boost. I don't know what to do, can somebody help me?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-03-06T03:51:21.532+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look at your account and it looks like something weird happened here.
