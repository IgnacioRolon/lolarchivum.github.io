I got into a blind pick game as master yi and completely destroyed the enemy team 23-3 with a 1V5 pentakill and 3 baron solos. I was carrying my team pretty hard, and couldn't wait to get those sweet honors after the game as my reward. \r\n\r\nThen it ended up with our Vayne getting 4 honors for sitting botlane and farming all game. She did nothing that game, other than farming bot. At the time i just couldn't believe i got 0 honors for my work and was kinda dissapointed. \r\n\r\nThen i started to wonder if i got a little extra honor progression for carrying my team, or Vayne got it all and i got nothing.\r\nBecause that's what i would call a small flaw in the system then. You can work you're butt off in game but you're teammates will honor someone random because they don't really care. Some people even skips honors.\r\n\r\nI just want to know if you can get honor progression for carrying or you HAVE to get honored by your team.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-08-02T17:38:38.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I could imagine that would feel pretty terrible if you carried the entire the match. I'm not sure what happened in your match, but just carrying the match doesn't entitle you to honors. The Vayne may have done something the team really liked and you can't sway their opinions on that. If everyone honored someone on your team though, then you'll get hit with a little more of that sweet sweet honor! \n\nSounds like you're on the right track though, so don't let one game discourage you. If you play positively then those honors will stack up for you! \n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Alfa Omega","date":"2017-08-03T22:49:55.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, just wanted to know :)","replies":[]}]}]}
