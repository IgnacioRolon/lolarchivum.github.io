He never touches the chat or does anything, while im widely promoting positivity in almost all of my games. My other friend who litterally trolls and feeds in every 4th or 5th game intetionally also hit honor level 3. People keeps on saying \"Be patient and youll get honor level progress\", but why am I the one who has to wait for it, when my friends are litterally doing nothing for it. I mean of course my honor level 4 friend plays well, but he doesnt really do anything else. If me and him were to be in a game together, and i would be doing much better than him, and cheering on my teammates EVERY TIME they get a kill or does something good, he will still for some odd reason reviece something like 2-3 honors after every game, and ill reviece 0-1, the 1 usually being from him. Some games of course are unwinnable, and sometimes ill feed unintetionally, and some people will threaten to report me. Does that effect my honor level in any way? And if they even go as far as to actually report me for inting, will it effect my honor level since i didnt int at all?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-13T20:56:35.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since those honor votes and up to each individual, there's not a whole lot we can do to influence who gets those honors. It sucks that you feel like you've been doing more to help your team overall, but there might be a specific reason your friend is getting the honors over you.\n\nHaving people threaten to or report you shouldn't affect your honor in any way, only actually receiving punishments will lower your Honor rank. And even then, if those reports of inting were false, we could verify that and adjust your rank accordingly!","replies":[]}]}
