It can be pretty hard to know if it's stuck or not since there's no progression you can see, but as long as you're playing games and staying away from anything that runs a chance of getting you a penalty you'll start to rise in time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-12-11T06:34:27.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's probably a sign of your behavior. If you haven't dramatically changed your chat behavior, you might not see your honor recovering as fast as you'd like. If you want to see your honor level rise, you basically just have to be honorable. Any slip in your behavior counts against you, and will extend the time it would take to rank up in honor. Some people were able to rebound and rank their honor up within a week or two after punishment, while others have felt stuck for months. It simply reflects your behavior in game. This also includes chat behavior in the pre and post game lobby.","replies":[]}]}
