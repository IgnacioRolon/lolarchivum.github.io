HOWEVER\r\nevery few mins or so my game stops for like a second and then is fine again. I havent seen any network problems no lag spike or packet loss or anything.\r\n\r\nI checked temps and its a laptop so its hotter but its not throttling or being crazy or anything.\r\n\r\nAlso the problem is worse on windows 10. Anyone have any ideas? or something I can use to log my computer while its running and maybe notice something.\r\n\r\nEdit: Also I've got newest drivers and I've tried older drivers and default drivers and every windows 10 fix. I have everything disabled that could cause problems and it still does it with basically safe mode on.\r\n\r\nAlso I've tried fresh installs of both windows 7 and windows 10. Both have the problem but windows 7 doesnt freeze up as long. Its more of a microstudder every min or two.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks again guys.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-15T01:05:58.943+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm....this can actually be a bit tricky because it doesn't instantly narrow itself down to either a hardware issue or a network issue:  essentially, given your description it could honestly be either.  \n\nThe best step you can take when encountering issues like this is to start ruling out root causes so we can narrow it down.  Connection Issues are much more common, so I would like to rule those out first.  Make sure to head over to our [Connection Analyzer Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) and run it.  It will give you a general health check on your connection to League as well as some steps you can try if it found issues.\n\nReply back and let me know if this doesn't seem to help!","replies":[{"poster":"Incinerated","date":"2016-06-18T15:45:03.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried what it said it didn't help. \n\n[img]https://s32.postimg.org/ha07y9hdx/Untitled.png[/img]","replies":[{"poster":"Incinerated","date":"2016-06-18T15:46:19.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My connection is good. 90Mbps and I'm 2 1/2 hours from chicago.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Michael Sykes","date":"2016-06-15T15:15:55.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I had/have the same problem and sent a ticket to the riot support.
