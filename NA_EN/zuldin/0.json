As far as logical conclusions go the passive reduces damage from everything that gets displayed as a crit in game. I'd agree that results in interactions like this not being intuitive at first glance, there's some argument for an expanded tooltip as a result (versus the tradeoff of additional tooltip length of course). \n\nThe main reasons we nerfed AP Trynd were that he was extremely overpowered and lacked counterplay. When Q healed for the same amount regardless of how much rage he had AP Trynd was able to heal through pretty much anything a single champion could do, while being mobile, killing towers quickly and wave clearing easily. There are other strong split pushers in the game still, AP Trynd was massively above them though when played well, and in a way other characters generally weren't able to interact with much.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-09-07T07:00:48.795+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're going to make the tooltip read \"if the damage dealt number is displayed in a slightly different way than normal, but is still not something you pay attention to, the damage is reduced\"?\n\nI dare you to pick a player at random and see if that decision makes any sense to them.\n\nCharity demands that Randuins either ignores magic damage crits ***or*** that crit modifying/interacting items, runes, and masteries also work with Spell Crits.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-09-07T06:22:10.574+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":4,"body":"But Randuin's doesn't say that it reduces damage against everything that is displayed as a crit; it's damage reduction against critical strikes.
