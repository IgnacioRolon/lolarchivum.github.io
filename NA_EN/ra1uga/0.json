However, due to his nature of his AP scaling, this would also allow him to work in the mid lane, and also is closer to the Dragon allowing for him to control the dragon more than if he was top lane. Then again, you have his passive on Harvesters of Sorrow, letting him gain more xp if he kills minions nearby an enemy champion, allowing him to potentially work as an AD/AP Carry- So what exactly is Morde?","replies":[{"poster":"Walentzack","date":"2016-12-29T00:32:35.340+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mordekaiser makes me think of a type of German ham.
