So in ideations typically we start by defining the champion: their personality, kit, big reads ect.  That helps us lock onto core features of the champion that need to be preserved and/or highlighted in the new skin.\n\nFor Zilean, obviously, his clock is pretty much his biggest read. In his ideation a good amount of  ideas were focused around his clock and one person pitched Blood Moon with the idea that his clock was a gong. Specifically tying the skin in with some one our newer Blood Moon skins that have recalls with musical/kabuki themes, this also helped our animators lock in a recall idea super early on. Additionally the white haired kabuki inspired mask would be another good Zilean read. \n\nSo, we did come up with other ideas in that session, I think 3 -4 went to the initial concept phase.

Did the team consider making a skin worthy of a four-year wait or did they just make this one with the goal of getting one released.  Nothing that's been said suggests otherwise and this is what makes BM Zilean a complete disappointment to me.\n\nI get that the team put a lot of hard work into Blood Moon Zilean (not that I can see it since it looks like a palette swap to me), but I don't like the idea that the goal was just to release a skin and not take into account the long wait since his last one.  Not since Mordekaiser is now the champion waiting the longest for a new skin (followed by Yorick, Sion, Kassadin and Taric).\n\nAre we to expect more of the same, for the skins team to just \"fill out their back log\" and continue to offer lower and lower expectations?

I personally like this skin a lot, and I get how you feel that I'm biased since I work on the skins team. I just feel like your complaints are more of a personal opinion (you wanted a time themed skin) rather than a critical opinion of the skin itself. These are just my observations based on your comments.\n\nWe did put a lot of though and time into this skin, he has a completely new model, new recall animation, and all new particles. I don't feel like anything about this skin was rushed, and it certainly wasn't just put out willy nilly.\n\nAlso in regards to \"filling out our backlog\", I was referring  to awesome skin ideas that we come up with in ideations that are put in our skins backlog or reference library for later use. We may come up with 5-6 ideas that are awesome but we can only use one at any given time. These ideas are then brought back up in future ideations and can still become fully realized skins in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"PapaGreg21","date":"2015-04-27T18:34:43.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Galetta","date":"2015-04-27T18:54:19.763+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PapaGreg21,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=E8yrQbwh,comment-id=0012000c000000000000000300000001,timestamp=2015-04-27T18:34:43.140+0000)\n>\n> I appreciate it when the skins team comes to the boards and talks to people about their product. I don't know many other companies that would care to do so with their customers. \n> \n> My biggest question for the skins team is why they don't make more skins that cater to the desires of the players. For example, I rarely see a Galio or Zilean in game but I see loads of Zeds. Wouldn't the public be happier with a legendary Zed skin instead of Galio wearing a tuxedo? This would also increase the profits of your company so it seems like the only downside is that the artists of the skins would not feel as artistically free to create what they want and players of fringe champions would feel left out.  \n> \n> I'm not saying make every skin solely based on what the majority of the public wants, but at least try to cater once or twice a year through either a poll or some research within the community.\n\nYo!\n\nSo when we make skins we try to make a skin for ever champion rather than 3-4 skins for the most popular champions at the time. If we just wanted to make a ton of money then yes we would only make skins for the top 20 champions at any given time. That would leave over 110 champions without skins for years at a time(yes that still happens now). There are mains for ever champion in the game and they deserve skins just like everyone else. We are trying our best to get out as wide a range of champion skins as we can, but it can take time with over 120 in the game currently.\n\nAs far as Zed skins goes, I can't really speak on whether or not we're working on a skin for him (legal reasons obvi). What I can say is that there are situations where we have an awesome idea that we can't use right away. A good example of this is event skins and champion updates.\n\n Let's say , hypothetically, that the community has been crying out for Pool Pary Zed, and we say yeah let's make this! But let's say it's Sptember and we want Pool Party Zed to come out with 4 other pool party skins in a huge in game event. We would hold into the idea and slot it for say June/July so we can have a huge awesome event! The idea isn't thrown away or rejected it's just slotted for a later date.\n\nAdditionally major kit changes and/or visual updates can extended times for new skins. We don't want to create a skin that will be remade in 3-4 months by the champion update team, that just creates unnecessary work for both teams.\n\nHopefully this was helpful. :P","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lady Septimus","date":"2015-04-27T06:17:02.953+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":":c i just dont get why it had to be blood moon specifically, why couldnt it have been galaxy zilean or perhaps moon zilean, or some sort of space zilean. like space explorer or idk, i think what throws me off so much about the skin is the *blood* part with the kabuki mask or whatever its called.

He is a very passive champion (both in VO and in gameplay) and avoids melee range at all costs, compared to him even Kalista is more into melee range than him with her chase style passive. \n\nThe skin itself tries too hard to be blood moon. While the others are easily recognizable, his (while easy to see it as BM) tries to force Blood moon onto everything of it, so instead of it being a skin in the Blood moon line it screams to accept it as a bloodmoon skin by putting the moon at every point they can on the skin. So the skin feels like its trying to force you to recognize it as a blood moon skin instead of feeling like a Blood Moon skin.\n\nPersonally I think Zilean should not have gotten a skin until he got a model rework to update to a new base and even changed some things about it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2015-04-25T13:49:24.621+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something to do with Water because Tides.","replies":[]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-04-24T23:23:39.285+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely Steampunk/Piltover Diana.

She's got three moon-themes already.\n\nMaybe other Diana mains are ready to see something different. I mean, are all of Lissandra's skins ice-themed? No.","replies":[{"poster":"Whitakker","date":"2015-04-24T13:02:42.728+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can certainly see your point.
