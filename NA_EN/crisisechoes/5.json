Even when I have an obvious advantage and can strangle the opposing adc for cs to the point of her being an entire item behind.\n\nHow do I climb without a duo... is it even possible as ad to climb plat solo? Do i just try to forsake lane phase and choose an adc that can cs in a 1v2 scenario, and try to snowball midgame? Idk.\n\nThe diamond support said I know what im doing and they dont understand why im stuck.
