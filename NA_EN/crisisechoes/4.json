They got lucky that one game, where they didnt ward, and the enemy jungler didnt capitalize on it. They got lucky that the enemy laner couldn&#039;t cs for shit either, so they think it will work every game. They got lucky that even tho they died 12 times and got 14 kills, the enemy team didnt use the gold advantage from the 3k gold you gave to snowball the victory. \r\n\r\nIf you want to stop losing and escape &quot;elo hell&quot; Stop playing the game like a robot and comparing yourself to everybody in your elo, compare yourself to... yourself, and where you want to be in the future. You&#039;re never gonna surpass your peers if you do the same as them, youre just holding yourself back.\r\n(epic life lesson taken from league)(also play {{champion:105}}  hes freelo)","replies":[]}
