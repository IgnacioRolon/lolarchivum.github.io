It will act normal (get around 30-40 ping) then it'll sky rocket to 400ping every time I go into trade or fights. It's not my internet since I have 5/5 bars and I turned off my firewall..\r\n\r\nAnyone else have the same problem? I turn downed my frame rates and that didn't seem to help much, again it only spikes up when I'm engaging in combat.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-07T19:43:16.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sudden lag spikes like this can be caused by an unstable connection resulting in delays.  They may be more pronounced in cases like team fights when a lot of data is being communicated between your network and the game servers.  Your internet might be perfect, but you can still have issues communicating with specific servers, and you can run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) to know for sure.\n\nMy suggestions would be to run through each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide in this case to troubleshoot.  That should do the trick, but let me know if you run in to any issues!","replies":[]}]}
