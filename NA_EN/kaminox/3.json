This bug will be fixed in 5.15.\n\nHowever, the Bilgewater option should be there, it's just hard to see.\n\nCould you try one more time, with the Theme Music dropdown selected (or clicked), and with your cursor hovered directly over the \"Updated\" option, and THEN scroll down and see if the Bilgewater option appears?\n\nHope this works!\n\nThe reason the music works for the ARAM is because it's the only track available :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Immortal Strife","date":"2015-07-30T16:39:52.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem, I've noticed it playing the new mode on SR.","replies":[]}]}
