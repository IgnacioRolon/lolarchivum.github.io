Diana is based on ancient Greco-Roman warrior. The Blood Moon design, being largely inspired by Japan and featuring reds and blacks along with the iconic masks, is not a duplication of any design of hers.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-01-20T21:55:00.385+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Blitzcrank is a robot, so you can't make a robot a robot\n\nI think we have the technology\nhttp://st.elohell.net/public/chill/d75f03203cc17514c4de487d86f97933.jpg?noredirect","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zedex","date":"2017-01-20T23:04:51.879+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Oleandervine,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=A7dokUKm,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-01-20T21:42:48.512+0000)\n>\n> Blood Moon Diana is not redundant because the thematic is not at all relevant to Diana. \n\nRight, because adding blood and red effects to her overall Lunar theme isn't close to the original at all and is completely stand alone and unique as a theme.\n\nCome on now.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2017-01-20T23:07:21.378+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zedex,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=A7dokUKm,comment-id=0000000000000001,timestamp=2017-01-20T23:04:51.879+0000)\n>\n> Right, because adding blood and red effects to her overall Lunar theme isn&#x27;t close to the original at all and is completely stand alone and unique as a theme.\n> \n> Come on now.\n\nHer overall theme is based around Artemis, not Japan.
