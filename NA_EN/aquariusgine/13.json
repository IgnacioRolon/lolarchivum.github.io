Riot made the changes and it resulted in games being decided by whether your botlane gets autofilled or not. \r\n\r\nAnother issue is reducing the game time for more action-packed gameplay and overbuffing ADCs. This completely threw the game&#039;s balance off, along with actually strategic gameplay. \r\n\r\nWhat we have now:\r\n- bruisers being crap, unless fed like hell\r\n- Winning botlane determines the outcome of the game\r\n- There is no strategic gameplay. What matters is if you pick the best snowballing champions. \r\n- If you lose lane, there is no making a comeback on lategame champions\r\n- Once a team gets a small lead, they do not have to work to keep that lead.

Why do you think all of the previously tried alternative bot tactics are no longer seen, ranging from double assassins, to double mages, double bruisers, and anything in-between, if not for the fact every single one of those things were nerfed out of bot lane as soon as someone tried those things there? Is it \"on paper\" to say that ADC+Supp hasn't been overriden or challenged because it is effectively the strongest you can get without a peer outside another ADC+Supp, given that all of the past challengers which involved all of the other champion classes have been nerfed out of competition by Riot, which only logically means ADC and Supp are practically the most overpowered classes in the game?\n\nBut then you gave me a totally not \"on-paper\" rebuttal which ultimately mounts up to \"if mages and assassins can somehow get past all of their peels because teammate power and land/chain their skillshots and combos, they could kill this 1 guy  on their 5-man team.\" \n\n* Okay, first, whether or not mages and assassins can actually solo kill even the somehow defenseless ADCs is still a big question mark. Because mages' items are gold inefficient and provides less value than most ADC itemisation for the same gold and you're also assuming the mages will land their combos perfectly which you know just how much work those are, meanwhile in the case of assassins they have their dreaded artificial burst-delay and the possibility that lethality might get nerfed at any time which is a problem in a sense that currently many assassins have to abuse the utterly broken lethality stacking to get things done so what' gonna happen when they put the items in-line eventually(?). \n* Secondly, that scenario is fucking impossible, ADCs will almost always have peels and team's priority on peeling them. Since you're reserving the power of the bursters to take down high priority targets, it means the guy holding the ball can not be involved in the action themselves, which means by simple analysis one can clearly see the chances of \"distraction\" tactics is naturally loaded against the attacker with smaller chances of success than the defenders by default. This \"distraction\" tactic is optimistic at best because because it never works against any team with consistency, let alone having ideal results as you described, unless you are in the bottom elos. Therefore the only solution is from roaming and picking, which again, doesn't work unless you play and mind game and really catch them out of position, assuming in a respectable elo bracket; and that's a shit ton of work just to get to somebody, definitely far more than you'd claim to be there.\n* Thirdly, you're saying it's entirely okay to trade so much for a single target in a 5 man team; don't you think it's kind of fucked up in a way that a person can be so is so vastly and unproportionally important that if we really fit the entire game into the nutshell, the entire game is just 2 ADCs fighting against each other while 8 other players are just trying to put the other team's ADC out of action for as long as possible? Hell, Top is the worst, all they're doing is just being a sentient cannon minion now, you really happy with this state of the game?\n* Fourthly, any sufficiently fed ADC will simply counter-burst the mages and assassin coming after them with guaranteed damage of AA and the problematic crits, on top of little need to land combos and exhausting their rotations like mages and assassins would. Riot makes sure that would be the case, I mean, why do you even think mage and assassin rework happened in the first place, if not to increase \"counterplay\" ADCs have against mages and assassins, who you know, are supposed to counter ADCs? You see the deal? This is not even including the addition of Stopwatch btw, which for some reason Riot also thought the only meaningful counterplay against enemy ADCs via 4-man ganking bot needs counterplay too, because I guess to them only an ADC can challenge another ADC or something.\n\n> - Nothing prevents that except the enemy lane proceeding to crush the 2v1 lane. ADC or not is ultimately irrelevant for this point.\n\nWrong, Supports will naturally have options to go somewhere else if other places is equally important as the lower half of the map. There is literally no reason to wander around the top side of the map, because there's barely any objective worth taking in the early game given Rift Herald doesn't really do much unless you're already massively snowballing or nobody in the enemy team knows what's up and just sit back and give you both free objectives and turrets, the damn Rift Herald is also taking so damn long to kill so it further depreciates any incentive to contest top side of the map, the thing only ever spawns once, and most importantly, Dragon now gives buff that rivals Baron's; so of course people play in the lower side of the map, why would they even try to gear up for the top side? Not some rocket science to understand, if you put equally alluring objective at the top, then people will spread differently depending on the need; it's clearly far from \"nothing prevents that\", it's more to do with \"nothing is being done to prevent that, and everything done is an antithesis to fixing it\".\n\n> - Do you want objectives? Then you take the objective-taking class. \n\nSince when ranged ADCs are the only characters allowed to take objectives? Anyone with supreme ability power and/or attack speed or even both can take down towers fairly quickly, especially when towers are quite weak in this day and age which is another much complained subject.\n\nThe reason why ADCs are mandatory is not because they somehow is THE objective-taking class, it's because they're overall the most overpowered who also happen to take towers pretty fast too, because they're catered like fucking babies and spoon-fed with most of the goodies in the game. It's kinda hard to not be the best in almost everything when Riot believes you have to both be tower pushers, tank slayers, capable of soloing your fucking counters because \"counterplay reasons\", duelists, and all of them will be hypercarries that scales into everybody's asshole; and yes, all of those at the same fucking time, because why? Because Riot doesn't believe Marksmen need an official subclass system (see below).\n\n> - ADC does have sub-classes: you have the more &quot;caster-based&quot; ones like Ezreal, Lucian, and you have your basic &quot;shoot a lot&quot; champions like Tristana, Vayne, and then you have a generous chunk of unique ones like Draven, Quinn, where they have very unique elements. Just because they aren&#x27;t officially named doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t exist.\n\nThat is not officially defined, that's why marksmen's balance is such a mess. What do you think would happen if Master Yi is balanced exactly the same as how they do with Talon or Zed? I use this analogy because Yi is typically built like most other AS marksmen while Talon and Zed build more \"caster\" where they stack arm pen/lethality; of course in the case between slayers and assassins, they're obviously separated in balance to prevent \"cross-contamination\" and make the balance hard to deal with. This is why they invented tags like say artillery mages, battle mages, and control mages within the subject of mages, and balance them accordingly to their subclass. But for some reason, this kind of idea is never put to actual use when marksmen is concerned, and there is no official subclasses defined for all marksman champs and it becomes a nightmare of someone breaking something on a daily basis.\n\nLike why? Why can't they just do the fix that's fixed all of the other classes up pretty well, do they simply intent marksmen constantly breaking things to be just normal everyday life? Why?\n\n> - They attempted this with Rift Herald and likely will continue trying to work with this in the future as it&#x27;s a long-standing goal. Remember that prior to Herald there was nothing there at all.\n\nAre you saying Riot needs more than 7 years to realise a imbalanced map creates an imbalanced play distribution? And this after the fact they deliberate make dragons give not just gold but permanent stats to the entire team and add an end-game dragon that rivals Baron, but no true early counterpart of early drakes in the Baron pit? They even go out of their way to make Rift buffs to be temporary and fixed on 1 person when it gave the buff, just to be sure no one would have an idea about shifting the action towards the top side, and then change the make top even more obsolete by changing Rift into a 1-use summon that anyone from the team that killed can take.\n\nIt's pretty obvious that they simply want it that way, that they just want the action at bot, and want it to be the most relevant. And that's just very annoying if not just bad.","replies":[{"poster":"SociopathFriend","date":"2017-11-26T22:09:35.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> What \"on paper\"?\n\n\"On paper\" in that instance meant any mage or assassin can 1v1 an ADC as you seemed to think the opposite.

I say you're too naive. Because they could've fixed it 2 years ago, or any time between then and now, but they didn't, and there is no hints that they're going to; what makes you think they'll truly fix it in the next couple months just like that?

Sounds great, now when they kill your Jungler and another lane, they can go and grab two objectives that grant power instead of just one.\n\nSo your rebuttal to \"Rift Herald is too insignificant against dragons as an objective thus people center their plays at bot\" is \"oh, what about the enemy team kills your jungler and wipe one of your lanes so they go and take both objectives so Rift Herald is not useless hurr hurr\"... like, idk about you but I have literally no idea how you even thought it qualifies for a counterargument.  Like, what does that have to do with anything, overly optimistic and oddly specific much?\n\nSo if I say a given champion X is underpowered and provided a list of justification for the claim, you can just go \"but what about their team gets an ace and shoves 2 of their opponent's lane into inhibitors; now that means this champ is obviously not underpowered\"?

That's not how it works, it literally makes no sense.\n\nADCs were not the only siegers in the game to warrant the \"have ever been\" nonsense. In fact they literally were not siegers but merely ranged DPSers; hell the ADC meta started with putting them in mid-lane to have access to roaming and add damage to other lanes if need be. ADCs were only UN-officially used as siegers in meta that later surfaced due to their range advantage (while stacking AS and AD to do sustained damage to towers); in other words, they were used as siegers in competitive setting NOT because of their **speed** in taking objectives down but **safety**, that's basically it. They are NOT somehow the best at it by definition, nor by a long shot especially back then, that has never been the case until Riot steps in and elect them into that role they were not part of by balancing them towards it, which as said before, expand and eventually include basically every things you can think of in this game; ADCs are now expected to have burst, sustained damage, utility, high scaling, sustainability, and capability to outplay most things even against their mortal enemies. \n\nThere were a class of champs in the past that were literally called \"Pushers\", who are designed to excel at shoving lanes and putting down turrets. Guess who populated that class then, just from memory, there were Yorick (I think), Morde, and Alistar, neither of which were ADCs. The greatest siegers on the other hand, have always been champs who can proc empowered attacks with or without AA resets, which traditionally has been a thing until again, Riot again steps in to remove almost all of the empowered attack procs on towers for no apparent reason; probably because they take turrets down way too god damn fast, and Riot wants ADCs to be the siegers instead; Trundle, Rengar, Jax etc used to obliterate towers in the matter of seconds, Nasus is a good reflection of that where his Q procing with towers somehow remained, you ever seen how fast a Nasus takes down a turret? The same goes for Udyr, if not for his current position in the game being on the lower end of the spectrum, you'd see more Udyrs running around blasting turrets left and right like nobody's business.\n\nAgain, just because Riot has some hard-on for ADC that has gone for some time, it doesn't mean ADC is by nature meant to do a lot of things Riot has for some reason elected them to do, and by that I mean electing them to literally be the overlords of this game and be good a most things at this stage. ADCs may be the siegers now because Riot specifically intends for that to happen, along with having ADCs being literally the best class in the game overall, but that doesn't mean it's all \"that's their point\".
