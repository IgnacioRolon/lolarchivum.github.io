Why is it necessary to make AP carries fall off lategame? (With the exception of a few) Also, why are AP items always having their AP reduced over and over again?\r\n\r\nLong story short, I don&#039;t enjoy playing AP champions that much anymore.

If you can't live long enough to land a couple spells, the general pattern is that you of course will fall off. The sticking power point is that other items scale too well. ADCs who can out-lifesteal a 1k nuke is definitely a concern.\n\nShields and health are particularly more of a counter for AP mages in a sense, because a nuke will deal \"X\" damage (reduced by MR). It then has to wait to be cast again. That wait period in early-to-mid game is a bit more consistent with the dps you need/want to be dealing, maybe not game-breaking, but certainly impacting. A 500 damage nuke on a 6 second cooldown sounds hefty, but the rate of fire means if it doesn't kill, the enemy can then retaliate, regenerate, mitigate and/or retreat. It's not that you're looking for an assassin pattern of a fast kill, but you certainly want to be able to hit again and actually kill on the 2nd or 3rd set of output you dish out. This doesn't happen so fluidly.\n\nYou consider the various roles you are fighting based on itemization...\nADC:\n{{item:3156}}  + {{item:3072}}  (2 shields and silly sustain piled on top of DPS.)\nTank: \n{{item:3065}} + now: {{item:3001}} and/or {{item:3194}} \nAssassin:\n{{item:3814}} + {{item:3156}} \n\n(Bruisers/Juggernauts fall into a hybrid-class of a few of the above, usually using the same items.)\n\nSupports and Mages generally are your prime targets since they ideally are the targets on level footing. The items they have available are the same ones you probably can get to counter them. Which is really troublesome since that line is foggy for those 2 roles. Yet it's more I find that the means to counter the other types of enemies are insufficient, rather than the fact that they can counter-build you.\n\nIf you counter-build an ADC as an AP caster:\n{{item:3157}} {{item:3047}}\nIf you counter-build a tank as an AP caster:\n{{item:3151}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3135}} \nAn Assassin?\n{{item:3157}} {{item:3047}} or {{item:3111}} {{item:3102}} \n\nIt's weird, because health is the counter-all. So Rylai's, RoA, GLP and Protobelt provide in that regard, but the more you analyze it's not quite the same efficiency as other roles have. Zhonya's doesn't really compel consistent engagement, more of an \"oh crap\" button than anything. You get a couple seconds on your cooldowns, but generally are put sitting duck. Boots? As a counter, they aren't really the most efficient choice, but sometimes you just have to. Liandry's makes for health melting goodness, but as a DoT you both need the magic pen and the CC through probably rylai's to make it count all while giving up sustain that other classes don't.\n\n{{item:3135}} is a weird one. It technically has more gold value than a Deathcap. Think about that for a second. It's dps-granting powers come from the Magic Pen which allows you to hit closer to the true dps-value of a spell. Your spell can read that it will deal 500 damage, but 100 MR will make that deal 250 damage without MPen. Void staff mitigates the effects of MR in this sense.\n\nThe only items I can 100% say work in a sense are Luden's and Morello's. One gives base power combined with utility of a splash to a spell and the other gives enough base stats to keep someone running for a while before you even consider the passive, which is necessary to counter a heal-based player, but also relies on a health threshold that people can sometimes avoid dropping below. (Though it wouldn't necessarily be fair or balanced if it was applied before the current threshhold.)\n\nIt's not easy to explain exactly what's wrong with itemization for mages, but here's the core points:\n\n* **Utility.** Uniques abilities items have, need to work for intended use or have an additional use to begin with.\n* **Sustain/Durability**. AP caster items lack a certain edge if you're looking for it.\n* **Synergy**. If you analyze what works about the items other classes use, you'll notice a lot more effects on items that kinda chain together. Synergy as a point is a weird one though. It's not that all the items don't have a certain synergy individually, only that the total composite effects could use some work, so that a complete item has more impact than buying a similarly priced component item.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2017-05-11T13:52:07.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Burst tends to fall of lategame when people can survive it unless done beautifully.

Mobility in combination with burst is obviously a good combination when it comes to killing people, which means that AD champions tend to counter mages (although there are anti assassin mages aswell who get countered by high range mages.. You get the idea). \n\nThat means it's pretty clear that if AD assassins go even with AP mages the AP mage tends to come out ahead because they are useful without kills and snowballing.

Now while ADC's may be diverse in how they do something (Jhin and Ashe Utility, Cait range, Vayne KILL ability) their job still boils down into Right click, with some left clicks thrown in as well. Now, from a Mid lane perspective, that can be pretty boring sometimes, so they diversify by giving them options for build. \n\nThe Various AS items help choose what type of ADC ya want, or something to compensate. Statick and Fireshot for extra damage, Static and Runaans for waveclear, Fireshot and PD for some added survival etc. Various Lifesteals for what you want to do (BT for drain tanking, Mecurial for safety, BorK for tank killing) and you have your CDR combo for those Crit builds who might also like CDR (IE, Essence).

They're that ice cream you buy at [Salt & Straw](http://saltandstraw.com/flavors/), they're already unique enough where they don't need items to vary up gameplay. \n\nADC's get variation in items because they're right click, Mages don't because their job is concrete in what they do, and how they do it. They're meant to be a more strict \"You do this very well\" Class, unlike ADC who is \"You can do this very well in various ways\" since ADC's come on later in the game usually.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Prestige AkaIi","date":"2017-05-11T17:48:29.775+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't see anything wrong with AP items right now. Sure they don't give as much AP as when DFG was a thing or before Zhonya's was nerfed, but mages still do an oppressive amount of damage mid to late game. \n\nThough, I don't care much if the items are changed too much as long as {{champion:163}} is still fun as hell. Plus she's almost always good, even when she's bad, as long as you can play her. XD\n\nEdit - \"If you think AP champions are worth playing for reasons other than team needs AP damage, please do share it with me.\" I don't know if it was clear, but my reason for playing mid is {{champion:163}} because not only is she fun, but her abilities give her the power the change the flow of the game. Her ult can completely change the outcome of a fight, for good or bad, which is why it's really rewarding learning to play her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ok sure but why","date":"2017-05-11T05:00:51.272+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":10,"body":"If it makes you feel better, at least mages can do a shit-ton of damage without even buying items, since their base damage is so high.","replies":[{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2017-05-11T14:09:38.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Exactly. \nIf mages think they have it soo hard they should just play GP mid like i do. \nOnce they come back with that stupid mana codex they can spam and push all day long and no matter how much you dodge you WILL get hit sometimes with an ori QW for example chunking you for 3/4 of your health with TLD while having like 40-60 AP. \nThey can efficiently roam all day, have very low cooldowns. \nIt's so sad how much better you have to play on GP mid than your average midlaner to achieve the same thing and that op even has the guts to pick ORIANNA as an example just makes matters worse.
