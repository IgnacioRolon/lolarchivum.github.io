If a jungle item gets out of control, we reign it in and make it something only junglers really care about, if a support item is too strong we increase the active cooldown or cut down on the stats.\n\nIn this case however, AD items were tackled, something that's needed to happen for awhile honestly due to how pitiful their items were comparative to the variety of choice that AP had. Problem is, that more than just marksmen are affected by these changes, and the AD itemization pool finds itself largely affecting AD assassins, bruisers,  fighters, and to a far lesser extent Juggernauts. Anyone who uses autoattacks as a vital portion of their damage rotation has the ability to opt into these new items, and the flare given to them in order to make meaningful itemization decisions only improves upon that idea of seeing what sticks with all these new toys to play with.\n\nCombine that with the attempt to make masteries more impactful and you have a recipe for chaos. The balance issues are more robust this season because the number of affected champions is far higher, and the changes to make masteries impactful requires that they be strong enough to have an impact, something that's proving to be a bit of an issue, but one they're trying to address.\n\nIt'll take a while for the game to get back to a neutral state, there's a lot that needs to be cleaned up, but preseason is the only real time  you can drop dramatic changes like this while still being able to do damage control (Since we're inbetween ranked seasons). Basically, be patient. Its going to take time for the game to come back to where Riot wants it to be this season, and most of these dramatic inbalances will likely be handled in a patch or two. (Patches are on 2 week cycles).\n\nThe other nice thing about these changes is that its a chance to highlight certain problem champions who've largely been neglected for quite a time. Champions like Jax and Irelia tend to have massive powerspikes when items are changed, and there are a number of champions whose balance is far too item-dependent. Bringing these guys into center-stage gives riot a chance to think about how their power fluctuates, and potentially take steps to bring them into a more centered state, so that they aren't perceived as bad when off-meta, and aren't ungodly abominations when the items align. Balance is a tricky bastard, its incredibly elusive, and the only thing you can really hope for with a roster as big as league has, is to bring the game to center-state. That takes time, for both the developers and the players learning how to fight around the new changes, and figure out what truely is or isn't in a proper state of disrepair.","replies":[{"poster":"Spicy Rice","date":"2015-11-23T18:40:00.524+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"All my up-votes.

Nothing about any of the preseason changes make me feel like the following year will even improve anything since riot never goes back on big changes no matter how much they obviously should.\n\nThe new masteries promote snowballing far more than the old masteries do, as most of them have quite large scaling (which I'm sure riot did to make masteries feel more relevant throughout the game). I don't know what riot expected as these keystones have painfully obvious abuse cases, and give massive power to champs that are already ahead, see crit keystone and deathfire touch. You cannot win a fight in bot lane if you are behind a little gold even with a fantastic engage, because the champ gets a nice 1300 gold efficiency bonus to his investment. The masteries also scale with level greater than before, again encouraging people who are ahead to stay far ahead.\n\nAlso, Riot, you said it yourself, preseason is time to make big changes, MAKE SOME BIG CHANGES! Don't keep messing around with these slaps on the wrist, you only have a month left, buff some items, gut some champions, test some things, idc, but do something!

The mage and tank roles have now been completely invalidated - seeing a 5k health Volibear melt within _seconds_ of engaging an ADC is retarded. Certain masteries were easily predicted as being overpowered due to their interaction with certain champions but feedback was ignored. Certain items were so obviously overpowered (ER, GRB) in testing and - again - feedback was ignored. Towers are more irrelevant than ever in combat, but still provide tons of gold. Snowballing mechanics were removed in Season 3 because they didn't promote skillful play, but rather permit the winners to get even more ahead when winning, and punish losers for - well - losing. Now they're being reintroduced with a vengeance and the outcome is predictable you wonder how people paid to work on this game as their job can motivate their decision.\n\nRiot managed to make a larger selection of ADCs viable only because they're completely overpowered compared to every other class in the game._ This is not good game design. _ It's a fucking circus.","replies":[{"poster":"iamleburk","date":"2015-11-24T15:57:18.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">engaging state of LoL\n\nDat pun","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sythriel Draken","date":"2015-11-23T07:13:40.951+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm hoping that the changes in the upcoming patch putting the experience gained back to that of season 5 will actually allow a late game.
