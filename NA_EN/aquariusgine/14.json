Everyone likes to mass downvote until you get to the root of the problem...which is your massive overstatement on the state of mages...much like this entire thread.\n\n3) Different champs of all kinds do different amounts of damage depending on a ton of variables. Someone like Vlad, Azir, or Vel'Koz could be expected to do *crap tons* of damage in a game, even if they're mages. Someone like Tristana may be expected to do a ton of damage in a long game, but her damage in shorter games may wind up being unimpressive, which is entirely reasonable. Even some mages played in the support role like Brand or Zyra can come out with some of the highest damage in some games because of their aoe influence.\n\n*This* is why I dislike threads like these. It perpetuates this victim mentality for a class that doesn't need it. Mages could use itemization variety? **Fine.** Deathcap needs to be tooled to be a cheaper buy so it doesn't require me selling a child to afford it? **Fine.** \"Mages do tickle damage and the game's way better balanced when it's focused around mages?\" I call bullshit.
