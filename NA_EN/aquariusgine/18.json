She's a cunningly beautiful woman with a snake tail.  NOT AN OLD HAG\n\n3. New splash art. Her eyes are not supposed to have pupils, they are supposed to be glowing. Did the artist not look at any of her other artworks before working on the new base?\n\n4. Her new voice-over completely destroyed that seductive-bitch personality. All she talks about now is poison. The lines are neither witty nor interesting,  they feel forced and uninteresting.\nHave you heard Sivir's lines? She also got a few extra lines for the Shurima event.

Not only did they force the most hated rework in the history of this game on her, they lazily replaced her textures while leaving her model and animations untouched and called it a VU. Then they went on to ruin any personality she had before by replacing her lines with something entirely unrelated to her actual gameplay. Heck, she doesn't even hiss anymore.\n\nI don't recall the current Cass making use of her poison at all, all she does is spam Twin Fangs. Too bad that kind of playstyle is simply unviable now, she was nerfed too many times already and left in the gutter to rot. Right now she's in a worse state than she was before the rework hit her. \n\nNine months later and there still aren't any plans to improve her - at this point only another rework can make her playable again. Also her last skin came out in 2013, naturally I'd expect something new this year but she isn't worth the trouble of making new skins for apparently - but she sure as hell is bad enough for a lazily done set of chromas. \n\nI'm appalled at the ongoing neglection this champion and her players have to endure.

But, what you said is true: Cassiopeia always gets slighted because she's not popular. Riot's going to leave her with her trash rework because they don't care. And Meddler said they weren't working on her but they'd get back to her later; which we all know won't happen. They'll just hope we forget about it and if someone brings it up again they'll say the same shit. It's just stupid. If they were going to half-ass it they might as well not have done it all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drive My Soul","date":"2015-07-29T03:17:06.272+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump forever","replies":[]},{"poster":"Conturbatio","date":"2015-07-29T17:26:55.839+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really hope all those idiots lurking in the champion design & game balance teams, get fired.","replies":[]}]}
