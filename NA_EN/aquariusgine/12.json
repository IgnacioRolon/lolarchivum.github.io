(Warlord&#039;s bloodlust, frozen mallet, phantom dancer abuse cases ?) And also because his &#039;balanced&#039; state is already so unfun to play against.\r\n\r\nI think the only way out of this is to rework him.","replies":[{"poster":"ThePikol","date":"2017-05-30T12:59:46.424+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Agree, Riot is making mistake trying to nerf his numbers.

Yasuo throwing up a Wind Wall in the right direction to negate your CC is far less frustrating than Yasuo throwing up a Wind Wall the complete wrong way and negating your CC. With the second, you know you caught him off guard, but poor ability design prevented you from being rewarded for that.","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2017-05-30T14:49:44.829+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just make it spawn at the proper location rather than inside of his model.\n\nIt is a simple issue to resolve.","replies":[{"poster":"JhomasTefferson","date":"2017-05-30T14:56:57.203+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes. he doesn't need to be gutted.

He pretty much had to have an overloaded kit to survive there. But the problem is, what he needed to have to be average botlane made him excel everywhere else. That's the same problem with Mordekaiser and why the melee ADC thing was a failed project all throughout. \n\nTrying to balance him with numbers or small tweaks is a wasted effort when what he needs is to be completely redesigned as a proper top or midlaner. His current kit is completely messed up by design, and the sooner Riot realizes that the better for everyone, including for the people who like him.

It doesn't have a shorter CD per rank (its CD is entirely based on Yasuo's attack speed), it doesn't gain range or duration you can hold it. The only reason it's maxed first now is because it's his only real damage outside of his ult (which is reliant on his Q).\n\nThe other choices are even worse. Maxing E has questionable benefits (.1 cooldown vs .5 isn't much, and most minions don't survive to cast on it again), but his W can be entirely useless in some match ups.\n\nIt's just like Draven's Q. An auto-attack boost. Except it only boosts one auto every 1.33-4 seconds. Draven without his Q's damage boost is useless.","replies":[{"poster":"JhomasTefferson","date":"2017-05-30T18:42:04.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's already no incentive to max it first. e first has been the norm since s4.\n\nthe only time i'd say go q first is in a lane where you'll be skirmishing a lot. the 20 bonus damage per rank isn't much.
