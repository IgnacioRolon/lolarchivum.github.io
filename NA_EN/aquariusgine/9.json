Yes, he&#039;s a bad teamfighter, but GOD he&#039;s just so damn overbearing in lane.\n\n5. I don&#039;t even have to start on how difficult it is to itemize against him.  lvl 1-6, if you stay under your tower to try to last hit as a mage, chances are you will be 40 cs behind until you get a {{item:3070}} or {{item:3114}}. And after that, you gotta start the Zhonyas rush. And if he is smart and buys a {{item:1033}} , god I .............

Soften up all the creeps and then blow them all up at once with an AoE. If you don't get Blue buff regularly, Mana is a real resource that matters a lot, so spamming spells and going OOM is much worse than clearing slower with AAs. Watch pro players, they rarely try to clear waves with spells unless they have to (i.e. not using a spell would mean they miss the majority of the wave to tower). Learning to last hit with AAs as an AP mid lane is what helps you keep from permanently pushing the wave in, which makes it easier to gank Zed (slippery though he may be). In addition, pushing the wave back in on Zed is the worst thing you can do, it makes *you* vulnerable to ganks, and also makes it easier for him to all in you since you can't hide under tower when he dives. Furthermore, it does nothing to hinder Zed, because he can last hit under tower VERY easily. Being under you own tower is the safest option.\n\nAnother really good pick against Zed is Malzahar. Malefic visions allows you to wave clear safely and easily, for no mana cost (often refunding a lot more than you spent even).

If he uses spells to poke, you control the wave. If he uses spells to push you under tower then last hit under tower healthy.

Since most mid laners are not particularly effective farmers under turret with auto attacks you are still forced to use abilities in this case if you want to reduce damage to the turret and get last hits.  Basically what the OP said in their edit.\n\nSome of your counter picks will probably (I don't play them so I can't be sure) run into this problem, namely Ahri and Kayle (Orianna does have AP ratio autos, I never seem to have problems with Viktor versus Zed, Malzahar straight counters Zed).  I would expect Ahri to be forced into using multiple abilities to save cs from the turret and I don't think Kayle clears fast enough to keep the minions out of the turret without tanking them.\n\nI agree with your split pushing advice, but Zed doesn't split push that much if he gets ahead.  In my experience he tries to lever that advantage into killing your carry as often as possible so teamfights turn into 5v4 (Zed probably used ult on the carry so he is weaker for the teamfight but he still has his AoE damage) and you can't take objectives very quickly (if that carry was an ADC, and not top lane fed Swain or something).  Basically he turns a large lane advantage into you not having your best damage dealer, winning teamfights before they start.\n\nYes, you can counter pick a Zed and you can have strategy around him, but he is still hard to deal with if he gets even a bit ahead.\n\nPS: I don't think Wither is as effective against Zed as you think.  He only really needs one AA in a kill combo and can still zone your movement with his W (or just blink to you).","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-03-30T21:44:06.922+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kayle can last hit under tower with relative ease because of E's on-hit damage, and the AoE means it is hard to get shoved in anyway.

Wither is good against Zed in a 1v1 mostly, which is the context I meant it in (because he won't be bursting a Nasus with only 1 AA in his kill combo).
