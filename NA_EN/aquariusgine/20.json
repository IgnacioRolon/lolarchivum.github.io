It's basically a rigged Nunu ultimate but is roflcountered by Udyr in bear stance (and you definitely rofl hard when you happen to be Udyr and get ulted by Galio while in bear stance).\n\nHe's got two poking skills that can help him win lane (these skills used to cost so much mana he couldn't afford to cast without being FORCED to buy mana regen). He also has a \"bastion\" that he can place on anyone and he gains hp when they take damage (it only heals a maximum of a certain amount after a certain number of auto attacks taken).\n\nHe's forced into doing things to be able to benefit from all of his skills. His Q can easily miss when all the champions are zooming around late game. His E doubles as a movespeed escape/chase and the whole party can benefit from it.
