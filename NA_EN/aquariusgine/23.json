I&#039;ve been playing her since I started league and she has never felt weaker.\nCan the last set of nerfs be reverted? Please??\n\nI can&#039;t match up to ADC&#039;s anymore. I can&#039;t reach them. My damage is restricted. Caitlyn is better at zone control and DPS.\n\nIs she is even being looked at? \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Mathbalnase","date":"2015-11-17T02:29:22.102+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cass sucks","replies":[]},{"poster":"Canastus","date":"2015-11-16T22:44:42.303+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's an extremely cute image of Cass you got there, I'm surprised I didn't have it in my collection yet. But yeah, I entirely share your view on this. \n\nRight now games end far too quickly for her to be even relevant since she'll never get to hit her lategame passive, there's also the issue of her kit being extremely situational and unreliable most of the time. She really could use some attention, it's too bad Riot doesn't want to do anything about her sorry state.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2015-11-16T20:28:03.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just got kinda wrecked by a Cass in top lane. I was playing fiora (for the first time since her rework). Cass got a crystal scepter first and from that point on i couldnt do anything to her. The permanent slow kept me from being able to use fiora's mobility to her advantage, plus Cass's movespeed burst when she hits a Q just made it even harder.","replies":[{"poster":"EcchiOtakuTM","date":"2015-11-16T23:43:32.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fiora isn't good in preseason, she's the only champion in league who the mastery changes actually ruined cause she synergized too perfect with the old masteries. I'm glad she was balanced now though you can still deal heavy damage  and slightly off-tank but you aren't a behemoth who can outheal, outtank, and out damage an enemy team (Although I kinda miss maining my fiora)","replies":[{"poster":"runedara","date":"2015-11-17T02:24:13.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The stacking ad seems pretty good on her.","replies":[{"poster":"EcchiOtakuTM","date":"2015-11-17T03:04:43.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well yea but she's prone to getting blown up before doing anything cause she lost tankiness. But i'm not really complaining about it since at least now she doesn't deserve any in kit nerfs so i'm happy about it.\n\nI also meant to say out-tank not out think, dumb auto correct","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dunkrius2g","date":"2015-11-16T23:10:23.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's cute.

And riot has decided that, that is oppressive when it works well. \n\nThat said, I would say she's on a knifes edge. You could probably make her work if you tried. And like the other guy said. Crystal scepter will help you stick to your target, as well as help you kite around them.","replies":[]}]}
