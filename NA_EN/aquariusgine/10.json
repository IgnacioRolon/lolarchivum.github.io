Because I really don't believe I have to reiterate the whole EEEEEEE- centric portion of her kit to note that she's just an adc that requires you to repeatedly push a button and land skill shots that have no relevant early game damage. She only remained relevant because of her insanely high lategame dps a la e that did a better job of shredding both tanks and squishies when coupled with the only conceptually unique portion of her kit, Petrifying Gaze.\n\nCassiopeia is like Nasus, gated by their early game. The difference between the two being that in Nasus's early game, anyone and everyone can interact with Nasus to stall him out of his late game or push him into it, primarily determined by the Nasus player's active capabilities in-game to get there.\n\nCass can basically just wait. She can play as passively as possible until she just gets to 500 stacks by waiting out the clock and randomly tossing poison pools onto enemy champions. Unlike Nasus, where the enemy can work to deny him his late game, Cassiopeia's late-game is bound to happen by virtue of design. The only way you can stop Cass from reaching her late-game is literally by securing victory before she gets to it.\n\nI don't know how many times I've said this though, but it's really annoying when, at a point like this, people STILL believe that the Cassiopeia re-work was ever any good. This is the point where even non-mains, like myself, can just SEE the banality in the re-work. \n\nHer kit's power is front-loaded into one ability.

However, she can chase near anyone otherwise (so long as she lands her q). The R cast-delay is a real pain, but its more for punishing/disengage over anything else (however if you are the only engage in the team, that's tough to swallow). If you really need to hit a team with it cast R THEN flash to mitigate the delay. It may seem drastic, but it is well worth the risk in certain situations where you can outnumber/outdamage.\n\nI don't like the PBE nerfs either, I feel like early mana is really important to helping Cass push. Pushing is time-consuming as Cass and Twin Fangs really help that. Her old passive used to help that even more, but that's out the window as we know. So yeah, the PBE nerfs will hurt bad.\n\nHer mana costs ARE high, missing a Q can be pretty detrimental, because you have to keep up in farm and harass too. Q is your bread and butter, and those Twin Fangs are the only thing to help compensate.\n\ntl;dr: Cass can't push too hard until around 7-8. Her Q just isn't enough, but Twin Fang helps. Her R is limited, and you can engage with it, but I wouldn't recommend it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mooing Kev","date":"2015-05-23T17:40:22.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Idk man, gutting her laning phase seems appropriate considering how monstrous her mid late game is.

I had zero mana issues early when i played her unless you're spamming a q every time it's up trying to harass. Landing her q wasn't that hard.. it has like 850 range and a small splash radius. If you can predict your opponents csing movement landing it isn't that hard. I faced a diamond 5 ahri last night and i pretty much all in cheesed her at lvl 2 after landing a q. I felt pretty disgusted how cheesy she can be.  \nI mean almost every single  traditional mage is vulnerable to ganks if you push past the middle with no wards. Btw she now stands a chance to zed if she has her ult due to that delay on zed ult and franky her late game is just a monster that makes zed look like a wimp.\n Once again every traditional mage cannot self peel and are usually in the back regardless. Cassiopeia is more of medium range mage but if she can land a good ult she can probably decimate 2 people during that stun duration. Lastly no offense but you're bronze 5 and I don't think your experience with her is really representative of her current state. She can and usually be absolutely disgusting and it does NOT take 45 mins for her to reach her peak. Sure if a game gets to 45 mins the cass will be monstrous but if you get to higher elo you will notice games will be a lot shorter because players tend to take a small victory and make a big lead out of it, snowballing even further.

You can get roughly three times the ammount of ap in a build as ad. So let's do some maths.. According to your math you multiplied number of hits by 5 so if we say 30 twin fangs instead.. we get a 3.0 ap ratio. So that means that cass regen is balanced. According to you. Anyways, stop just being salty because your champ was nerfed :3","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mathbalnase","date":"2015-05-25T03:04:23.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Leu07,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=KR8FwKMx,comment-id=000b000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-25T00:19:48.398+0000)\n>\n>it's been nerfed on the pbe to a X + (0.6 ap ratio) heal \n\nYou dropped a zero.\nThis should read (0.**0**6 ap ratio)","replies":[{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-05-25T09:36:40.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mathbalnase,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=KR8FwKMx,comment-id=000b0000000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-25T03:04:23.552+0000)\n>\n> You dropped a zero.\n> This should read (0.**0**6 ap ratio)\n\nThank you!

I see no point in playing a champion in which I'm prevented to have fun algorithmically! Nasus has a bad early game, but if he's good (or the opponent is bad) he can get fed even in the early.

Either her q doesn't give 20 MS or give Her E like an increased cd/ cap. Her level 2 is one of the most obnoxious thing next to LBs lvl2. Get hit by one q? Proceed to get bombarded by 3-4 qs losing up to half ur hp or even more with autos in between thanks to the nice MS boost. Personally i think Removing the MS on q is necessary because simply just sticks on you too hard in the early laning. Cass arguably is the hardest carrying mage in the entire game with proper usage and usually champs with monster late games have weaker laning phases. Cass's laning is actually pretty decent if not strong vs certain match ups.","replies":[{"poster":"Mathbalnase","date":"2015-05-25T13:26:26.306+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"A) taking time to AA as Cass while your opponent is in range and poisoned will significantly lower your DPS.  If you don't know this simple fact, I don't know how much value we should be putting on any other commentary you might have, but it can't be much.\n\nB) One of post-rework Cass' biggest problems is the fact that the vast majority of her kit's power was shoehorned into her E.  And now you're suggesting removing even more power from her Q?  No.\n\nC) Cass can't carry if Cass is dead.  Or OOM.  Or severely under-farmed from being dead and/or OOM too often.\n\nD) Cass has a **shit** lanephase against almost all of her common lane opponents.

Her stacks are very poorly done and just simply do not scale correctly.\n\nBut really, she does not need a nerf at all.  Even if they want to gut her, that's likely already done by the loss of mana regen from the masteries she's going to get anyways.  Without this mana her early game would probably be so weak anyways that I don't think further nerfs are at all justified.  Although maybe that 75 mana will be useful but I'm not expecting much from it.  At least her archangel's staff will be a little stronger but she's going to be so bad until she has it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kaipop","date":"2015-05-23T20:21:31.506+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"I just hate the amount of free stats she gets and how bad cassiopeia players can still do really well just by spamming e mindlessly","replies":[]}]}
