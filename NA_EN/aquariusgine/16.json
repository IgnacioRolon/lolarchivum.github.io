Sure, she doesn't have much CC or survivability, but it's near Shaco-level paranoia when you haven't seen Eve in a while. If you're a squishy under 1/2 HP and not pushed under turret, she's on her way to your lane if she's any good. Sated gives her AD build enough burst to compete with other top junglers if she isn't kept under control, but it's about even with Runeglaive AP as far as I've seen. I like AD currently because the sustain helps her be less vulnerable to invades from Rek and Lee.\n\nAs someone who played Eve before Sated and Runeglaive, I think the most effective way to counter her is to move your ward line up into her jungle. She loses invisibility while in combat, so a ward between blue buff and gromp (if she's red side) will spot her at either camp, or on top of krugs (if she's blue side) will let you know both when she's clearing that area and what direction she's heading after clearing.\n\nShe's a great scout since her vision range is longer than her detection range, and she gets a notification if she's spotted, unlike other invisibility champions.
