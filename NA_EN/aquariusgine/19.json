It requires both you and your support to not get hit Zyra's skillshots, which isnt always easy - if it were easy, Blitz would be the easiest to counter in the game. MF does outrange Zyra outside of her plant poke, and the plants alone wont win you lane unless you stand next to them ignoring them. However, due to Zyra being extra squishy + running no MR, MF's base damages hit pretty hard. MF definitely has the advantage in the poke war.\n\nIt also requires you to have some sort of setup ADC if you arent getting jungle help. You can run Ashe, Jhin, or Varus pretty well, and its an easy kill post 6 if you can lock Zyra down for even a second. You cant run a low-range ADC like Vayne or Lucian (Sivir is okay since she just pushes so well from range) with a MF support and hope to survive vs a decent Zyra. Also, the opposite is also true - if the enemy has an Ashe, Jhin, or Varus to engage at 6, youre pretty much dead as an MF support. Other ADCs work like any other poke lane - if you get enough poke down you win. If not, you lose. \n\nThe problem with running a high damage threat as a support is still there. You generally are left with a low engage, low peel teamcomp. Zyra only became a meta support since she has so much disengage in her kit.","replies":[{"poster":"Sp33d Zer0","date":"2017-02-16T19:16:23.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is a skill matchup, but it favors MF heavily, and is why she is regarded as a Zyra counter.
