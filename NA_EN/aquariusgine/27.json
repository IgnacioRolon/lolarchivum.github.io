Abyssal was already completely fine but it got a major buff in the price decrease.\n\nNot talking about the old Rod of Ages changes, either. I'm talking about the pre-season giving it 20 AP in exchange for a 300g increase when, again, items were getting cost increases across the board regardless.\n\nRight now if you use AP and you're against even one non-support with magic damage, you take Abyssal - even if you don't use the aura very well. Rod of Ages is often taken on people even if they're also buying something like Morello for their mana needs because the stats are just crazy - it's supposed to be weak early in exchange for being crazy late but 80 AP, 300 HP and 400 mana at 0 stacks is more than acceptable for 0 stacks.","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2016-02-22T23:32:58.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Nobody builds Morellonomicon for mana regen.

Fuck this community\n\nI admit I was a bit snide but I was angered by the delusions that the Boards and a lot of low elo people are holding and I am willing to apologize. The fact that they think that armor penetration is better than magic penetration in terms of accessibility and effectivness baffles me. Do they even notice the rework of Last Whisper last year?\n\nApart from Jhin, name me one AD champion that can reach more than 500 AD and have stellar scaling like Veigar and Ekko (like his ultimate). There is a reason why you can get more magic resist on an AD item than armor on an AP item. There are plenty of champions whose abilities do not scale with total AD but bonus AD, essentially a worse type of scaling than total AD. So to balance it out, flat armor penetration becomes more easily attainable.\n\nThe reason why flat armor penetration is more accessible than magic penetration is that they are in small amount. Youmuu's Ghostblade is the only item that has 20 armor penetration. The rest are all 10. At most you can gather 30-40 (40 is actually hard because it means you need 3 item slots for AD items that provide little to no resistances) flat armor penetration from items. It's an illusion of choice. Comparing one item to another item which bears no resemblance apart from the fact that they share resistances is delusional.\n\nPercentage armor penetration/reduction comes in the form of either bonus armor penetration (which really sucks, compared to pre-reworked Last Whisper), or conditional percentage armor reduction (you need to do physical damage 6 times or use \"physical bleed effect\" on a single champion in order to reach full potential of the Black Cleaver).\n\nApart from that every single champion has scaling armor except Thresh (due to his passive). Disregarding Thresh, the lowest attainable base armor at level 18 goes to Gnar, sitting at 66.5 armor (plus he can switch form to gain base armor anyways), but even that value is higher than the highest base magic resist on a champion at level 18 being 53.4, and that's the base magic resist on tanks and melee assassins. More than half of the champions have only 30 base magic resist, like I said before. Void Staff is still in the form of percentage total magic penetration, making it more favorable than Last Whisper and its upgrades.\n\nTherefore, It's relatively easier to penetrate all the magic resist on a champion than to penetrate all their armor on a champion. It is possible to penetrate and reduce all of the armor on a champion but it's not viable (full armor penetration rune page against a squishy champion is possible but very stupid).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dªy","date":"2016-02-22T23:09:24.587+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"remember when they nearly reworked it into a tank item?\n\ntbh i still think such an item should exist but as a seperate item while keeping abyssal","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Liberal","date":"2016-02-22T22:00:54.115+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"As much as I like it, ap assassins are abusing it.
