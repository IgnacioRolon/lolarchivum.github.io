I downloaded lol, and it gave me RADS error. I thought it was about my firewall, but no, i had a danger of getting a virus by disabeling firewall, and it didnt work. I tried the thing with setting something to 8888, 8844, and then going to cmd and typing ipconfig /flushdns, or whatever (copypasted from youtube XD) and it still didnt work. I went to my rads folder, and seeing what was in system, and it had everything, but it doesent work.
