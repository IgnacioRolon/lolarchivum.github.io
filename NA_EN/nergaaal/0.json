I get its intended point, but I still get like one in 5 games where somebody ragequits.\n\nMEANWHILE it is like the 4th time I get a 5-game penalty in the last month and pretty much all of them have been technical. One of the previous one was over a game that loaded to 100% then for whatever reason the loader crashed and when I reloaded the game it took like 4 mins (old laptop). Oh, of course I got another game where I buy everything I go invade-fail and then walk to the bot tower, I type in chat that I should afk, and sit by the tower unmoved trying to snipe an unsuspecting enemy with the hook, only to get at 3 mins a remake vote. Guess what? I was tagged by the leaverbuster.\n\nBut the MOST INFURIATING one is the last one where some **dude DCed at around 7mins,** and then I took his lane **only to have another guy DC** slightly after 10. At that point I went to the fountain and alt-tabbed and waited for the 20 min vote. Guess what??? I got penalized for 5 games because I am supposed to click my mouse until 20 mins even if I have 2 afking teammates. \n\nBest part of all of this? Every batch of 5x20mins waits I got AT LEAST one ERROR FINDING GAME message, which you guessed it, forces another 20 min wait.\n\nPlease Riot, tell me HOW IS THE LEAVERBUSTER SUPPOSED TO WORK?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-09T20:12:08.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regardless of intention, a disconnecting or going AFK in a match negatively impacts everyone in the match. This is a key reason why disconnections are all treated equally and why penalties cannot be modified in any way.\n\nThe way the [Remake system](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ) specifically works is that any player who is *inactive* in the first 3 minutes of the game for 90 seconds or more will be marked by the system. At 3:00, if any player has been marked, a vote for a remake will begin and if passed, the player who caused the remake will receive a loss penalty.\n\nTo address the *error finding game* message, I recommend working through the steps in our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), as they commonly resolve the issue. Let me know if those steps caused any change.","replies":[{"poster":"Nergaaal","date":"2016-10-18T16:48:36.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What creates an \"inactive\" tag?
