Secondly, check my match history here, i was playing ALL-IN-ONE (mostly in custom games) and Sona support in ranked. I highly doubt any scripts would have promoted the gameplay.\r\nSo I thought, this is some kind of mistake, all i have to do is opening a support ticket and they'll fix this easily.\r\nAnd I did, and they replied very fast.\r\n\r\n> Your account has been permanently suspended following the use of scripts, hacks, exploits or unauthorized third-party programs in League of Legends. Accounts that are caught using hacks to gain an unfair competitive advantage are subject to permanent suspension. We work hard to preserve a fair and competitive environment in League of Legends. Regardless of intent, use of unauthorized third-party programs is explicitly against the Terms of Use, which can be found here:\r\n>\r\n> NA: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/legal/termsofuse \r\n> EUW: http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/legal/termsofuse \r\n> EUNE: http://eune.leagueoflegends.com/legal/termsofuse \r\n> OCE: http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/legal/termsofuse \r\n>\r\n> Keep in mind that account sharing of any kind is also against the Terms of Use.

Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.\r\n\r\nTell me what you smell from this? I smell bureaucracy, dictatorship, and arbitrary. I bet this guy didn't even closely look at what I wrote in that ticket. I cannot self-prove innocence for this sick reason so I asked them to 'double check the data they collected and unlock my account immediately,' Obviously they did not. But I did closely looked their Term of Use, which has been modified recently.\r\nArticle 2.1.2 says this:\r\n\r\n> 2.1.2. Us.We may terminate or suspend your account if we determine, in our sole discretion, that:\r\n> (a) you have violated any part of this Agreement;\r\n> (b) we have stopped offering the Riot Services in your region; or\r\n> (c) doing so would be in the best interests of our community, the Riot Services, or the rights of a third party.\r\n> We may make such determinations, among other ways, by using automated systems and machine learning tools.\r\n\r\nThe last sentence is the highlight. 'Automated systems and machine learning tools' can now banned our accounts, permanently. Considering the two email regarding my ban was received on June 20 2016 10:50 PM MST, which was shortly after my last game that day, I highly doubt my ban was done by a human.\r\nSo I replied immediately, with anger, that I refuse to accept punishment for wrongdoing that I did not do. I replied on Tuesday around 1 pm and it has been more than 55 hours since I opened the ticket. Not a single action has been taken by Riot games.\r\nOnly I got another reply yesterday.\r\n\r\n> We have a Player Behavior team in place dedicated to working with these requests, so I need to transfer your ticket. A Player Behavior Specialist will be contacting you as soon as they can.\r\n>\r\n> Please keep in mind that we respond to tickets in the order we receive them, so ‘bumping’ your ticket by sending us additional messages will send it to the back of our queue. This might inadvertently delay our response :(\r\n\r\nThis sounds like they're doing something about it. To make myself clear, I replied with\r\n\r\n> Let me make the situation more clear.\r\n> ----------------------------------------------------\r\n> 1. I did not use hacks, cheats, scripts of any kind, nor did I intentionally modify my client. Otherwise I wouldn't be opening this ticket.\r\n>\r\n> 2. Something weird did happen on my client right before the ban (as a described earlier). I have no idea what was going on but I didn't pay much attention to it as client crashes, bugging out and server lags are not uncommon. It is your responsibility to investigate and solve software design flaws and bugs.\r\n>\r\n> 3. I am requesting you to carefully review my case because I believe it is a mistake. As stated in your term of use, a ban can be initiated by automated system.\r\n>\r\n> 4. As an user of yours, especially a paid user, I believe I should be treated fairly and justly, without arbitrary and unconcern.\r\n\r\nAs of now, no reply, account still banned.\r\nAll I'm asking is a simple thing, that clearly something went wrong and I want them to find out what went wrong, fix it, and make sure It'll never happen again. And I have been asking this repeatedly.\r\nIt took one microsecond for their 'automated systems' to ban my account and I have no idea how many days are they gonna take to fix.\r\nIt is also possible that they'll never admit that they did something wrong. Probably a single user means nothing to them while they're taking dollars from millions of.\r\nEither way, I'll keep this post updated.","replies":[{"poster":"The Unseen BIade","date":"2016-06-24T09:19:20.731+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":3,"body":"Riot is bad.

False positives happen.  Sure, more than likely the OP used a third party modification, but to make such a claim that there aren't mistakes is, quite candidly, bullshit.

I've already mentioned the only example of a mistaken ban I've ever seen, and it had nothing to do with scripting. If I'm mistaken _on this point_ great, I'd love to read that case.\n\nRegardless you seem to have overlooked the entire middle paragraph, which takes up the majority of that comment. Detecting scripting is not like a drug test. You won't get a false positive just because you took an ibuprofin before pissing in the cup. One flag (a program injecting) leads to a second check (whether its a known permitted 3rd party program or not), which leads to a 3rd check (any markers, files, or packets that are confirmed to be part of scripting software), and finally, a plethora of other possible flags (malformed packets, high volume of packets, an action every 50ms exactly, actions occuring with less delay than expected, conflicting movement signals). \n\nIts not ONE thing they check that can cause you to be banned because you have \"this one weird program that uses this one weird file that is associated with scripting, but its totally not a scripting program.\" The system looks for tons of different data points to determine if you're cheating or not. If you somehow managed to cause a false positive I wanna see your system. If you didn't intentionally write a program to cause a false positive, you got some weird shit going on in your computer.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LaurentiuSs","date":"2016-06-24T09:47:59.275+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/xI8qaH9c-my-account-has-been-permanently-suspended-for-using-3rd-party-program-i-havent-used-them \nsame situation here man, best of luck","replies":[]},{"poster":"DRE13001","date":"2016-06-24T07:38:43.210+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hello, I was in the exact same situation back in january when out of a sudden they sent me an email saying Im banned for using a 3rd party program to gain an unfair advantage, after I sent them a support ticket they responded with the exact same thing they gave you, and if Im right the next thing they will say will be the same as what they wrote to me which is:\n\n\"I can't speak to any specific programs that you may have used or why you used them but I can say that the only reason that we took action against this account was because it used scripts, hacks, exploits or unauthorized third-party programs that provided a competitive advantage to it.

I think this is because of Riot being bought out by a company who probably only cares about money.

I uploaded the replays and the vast majority of ppl said \"THATS TOO LONG WE CANT WATCH THAT!\"\n\nIf tha is the case, Riot certainly can't either.
