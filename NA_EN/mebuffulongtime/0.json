My average upload speed is about 3.2mbps and 6mbps or so upload.  In every game now, I will have a ping consistently above 500ms.  Occasionally it will drop to the low hundreds but never for long.  I also usually end up disconnecting at least once per match.  On my PS4 using the same connection I rarely have connection issues and never on the same scale as when I play league.  Now as a disclaimer, I am using a late 2008 aluminum macbook.  The fps however is usually pretty good and there is little graphical lag.  If anyone has had similar issues or thinks they might have a solution I would really appreciate it.  Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Sqùìrrèl","date":"2015-11-10T09:13:04.116+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the same issue. Ironically, I am commenting on the same stuff I see that the \"Troubleshooting Connection Issues\" link is being put on. I've tried all that, it doesn't work, and has been an issue for weeks. It has been exceptionally bad the last few days. I am on the West Coast. This is something Riot really needs to look into and fix... It's not just me, or you guys here, but probably dozens if not hundreds. Some people have this issue every single day and a large portion probably gave up. Not everybody comes to the boards or uses the support ticket system. I gave up on the support ticket system myself. I mostly gave up coming here. The solutions do not fix the long-term and the same problems constantly pop up. People put a lot of money into this game... We deserve some quality, sustainable fixes for things like MS pings.

We can see a problem but it may lay between your ISP and their upstream provider (the upstream provider connects to Riot directly). Can you log a fault with your ISP reporting this issue? If it is constant then it should be easy for them to replicate if they create an account and launch a custom game.","replies":[{"poster":"MeBuffULongTime","date":"2015-11-11T19:03:16.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Korensky,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=wTZZQrYX,comment-id=000000000001,timestamp=2015-11-11T18:35:18.785+0000)\n>\n> We've been in touch with the company who service your ISP.
