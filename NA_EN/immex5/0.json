Not being allowed to pick my champion isn&#039;t fun at all. Why would you try to balance a game mode with no mana and 80% CDR.... seriously.

I didn't say there was complete consistency, just that \"things like consistency\" remain. Having a smaller and specific champion pool limits what you can get in ARAM.

The only thing I think is Riot should really make the random champions based off of the entire roster and not just the champions you own. ARAM only accounts are just getting to much of an advantage over this and that's why we still see the same few champions in every game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-25T19:00:37.183+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"URF is now fun, but some people will always be mad.","replies":[]}]}
