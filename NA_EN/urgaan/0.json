She's my favorite champ and was my text tone for my ex, i still love her and that shit just makes me beyond depressed. I'd like to play leona without being reminded of sadness every other time she walks","replies":[{"poster":"Rainboom","date":"2017-11-19T18:40:06.539+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe you can remove voice lines without messing with game files (Hint: don't, it's against the ToS).\nI do believe you can turn Character SFX off in game (through Options).  \nSorry to hear that it reminds you of your ex, things will get better with time! Try associating the line to something else. Read up (or refresh!) yourself on Leona's lore and see where that line would fit into it and link it to that. After a while, the line won't remind you of your ex anymore.\n\nHope I was able to help! {{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-19T23:03:04.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I wouldn't advise messing with the game files, only because it could actually cause some corruption and possible crashes while you're playing.\n\nThat does really suck that Leona's VO's have begun to remind you of your ex =\\ . I wish there were a way to only disable her lines, but I'm afraid there's not. As AoA Nel mentioned you could try disabling all champion SFX, but that might start to feel a little bland.","replies":[]}]}
