His voice lines for recall and his ultimate I could hear no matter were I was on the map, even if I was at Baron Pit while he was down at Dragon Pit. I did not have my screen looking anywhere near him, either. He sounds cool, but I'm assuming that it shouldn't be happening.","replies":[{"poster":"ThisName1sDumb","date":"2019-06-14T18:21:35.557+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh I thought that might be intentional, I noticed it too.

It is kind of annoying though, yeah.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SuicidePlank","date":"2019-06-14T17:40:57.635+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Me too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garen Nightmare","date":"2019-06-14T18:13:13.325+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"And that was when I wondered if Jhin and the East Altar are the same voice actor...","replies":[]},{"poster":"4 Step Cadence","date":"2019-06-15T12:25:25.246+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is definitely a bug. Want to know why? Because his recall and ult cast lines don't play when you're playing him. I just tested it. Apparently, they only play for his allies.\n\nI've also encountered another audio issue with him. Sometimes when he reloads/fires his 4th shot, he'll say his line for loading his 4th shot.\n\nI'm so sad this skin is plagued by such issues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2019-06-14T20:45:17.674+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think its intentional. not sure tho. but feels like it.","replies":[]}]}
