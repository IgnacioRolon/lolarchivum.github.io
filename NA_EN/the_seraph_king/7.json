Plus, denying incentives discourages players from learning/playing that game mode, which further skews the human/bot ratio. Secondly, as far as I've heard, there aren't any bots in ranked TT anyway. Finally, lucky picks and wombo combos apply to Blind Pick SR too.\n\nPersonally, my main gripe is that Riot's reasoning for tokens being SR-only was that Champ Mastery should require a high standard of competition. However, normal SR games are included, despite Riot repeatedly stressing that normal games are laidback and casual. Furthermore, ranked TT games are *excluded*, despite always giving the same rewards as ranked SR and Riot constantly emphasizing that ranked games are for serious competition. It just comes across as an illogical way to encourage people to play SR over TT/ARAM.\n\nOnly ranked? Fine. Normals as well? Alright. But going halfsies is just strange.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Seraph King","date":"2017-04-17T19:29:27.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wanna cry now.
