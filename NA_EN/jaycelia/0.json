Things didn't add up when i tried to recover my account with the email etc. Made this account, stalked my own profile to see \"i\" had recently been playing.. even roles im not comfortable playing. i only play mages/lux (even said 84% mages or something) but this person ruined it by playing adc :(( poop. \r\n\r\nI couldn't seem to find where to contact riot directly?\r\n\r\nAnd i don't think i have enough proof/reciepts to back up my statement that this is my original account.\r\n\r\n- I have old videos from 2011'ish of me playing on my account though.\r\n- recently asked my irl friend to check if im still in his friends list to help me prove it?\r\n \r\nVery sentimental about that account, has so much history.\r\nEven have/had the green banner and not to mention skins.\r\nHopefully a miracle can happen, if not i'm willing to accept my faith.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-28T00:46:31.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can absolutely get that account back as long as you can verify that you were the one who created the account with a few key questions.
