Once I got into the lane, he flashed his emote against me immediately, but it wasn't the classic yellow and blue level 7, it was a silver-ish kind. He just spammed that and I asked him how he got it and he preceded to bully me in lane. We then remade. Anyone know how to get that emote?","replies":[{"poster":"Blakiepug","date":"2017-09-09T01:03:03.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I believe you are talking about the new Star Guardian mastery emote. When you equip the new icon that you get for playing Invasion once, it will change your mastery emotes to have a Star Guardian theme as well. It's pretty sweet. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-08T22:11:36.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure which one you mean without a screenshot.  ><  There shouldn't be any new emotes for masteries, though.
