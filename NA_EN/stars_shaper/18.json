It's a tough one too to carry from Support because of that.  I mean you can still carry, but you need more follow up (also shout out to Brand/Malzahar/Zyra :P).

Since you are heavily dependent on who you bond with you can't just shut out everyone else.  At the same time you can get heavily flamed because people can get frustrated at themselves, and then others, when they mess up their combos with Taric.\n\nYou have to keep in mind Taric is inherently stressful for your ADC to play with because they suddenly have two champion's kits to worry about but only control over one of those kits.  As such he can cause a lot of frustration and backlash from ADC's while also having to work very closely with them.\n\nWhile I fully support all Taric players I would recommend at the very least duoing with an ADC who knows how to play Taric if you are going to play him.  Personally I don't do this but I also have thick skin and am very friendly while also already having a lot of skill on Taric so I know how to take most of the extra load off my ADC.  For anyone trying to learn him though I definitely recommend only playing him with a bot laner you know or in normals.","replies":[{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2017-03-07T04:57:33.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol same goes for anyone using kalista, kench, and bard. it's a sad day in tinker town when being paired with a player who's unfamiliar with your support kit.","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2017-03-07T05:21:29.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup, Taric and Kali especially.

If you're playing Raka and the top laner dies it's your fault for not ulting.  Being level 1 is no excuse.  \nIf the ADC goes ham and dies it's your fault.  Being back at the base buying is no excuse.   \nIf the mid laner dies because there weren't wards, it's your fault.  Yes you must ward the entire game board starting at level 1 with just one trinket.    BTW if you go warding and 2 players from the other team jump you.  That you asked for an escort is no excuse.  \nIf you're playing Morg and your ADC is constantly being pulled by Blitz because he can't position properly, it's your fault.  That it has only been 1 second since the last time it was on him and is down is no excuse.  \nSlay even one minion and well you're the pits of the world.   \n\nRule 2.

Personally, I consider Taric a niche/counter pick against AD heavy teams, as that's where he really shines, but that's me. However the Zyra support advise still applies. Presume your ADC is incapable, and play accordingly. If they start to show signs of intelligence, then you might choose to be more aggressive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2017-03-07T05:28:13.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i game jump go to over watch and deal with diffrent types of idiots there just transfered my ps3 gta online character to my ps4","replies":[]},{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2017-03-07T04:51:20.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes you need a 5 man pre-made if you want to have a team with a pre-game plan. there is not enough time or willingness to co-operate among a random gaggle of yuppies to actually form a plan at champ select. trying to do so is how arguments start. just play your champ and your lane. if everyone did that then there would be so much less stress involved.\n\neven as a support all you need to do is negatively affect the enemy team and positively affect your own team. that's how you win in solo queue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"seasaltcake","date":"2017-03-07T01:19:53.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just play Sona and float around doing my best.

Looking at enemy team comps/item builds to see what counters I might need (ex: Mikael's to remove important cc or Locket to help team survive burst) and what I might need to do (focus on keeping a specific assassin off the adc or something).\n\nSometimes you screw up, but focusing on what you CAN do is always better than focusing on past events you cant change.\n\nThat all being said.....\n\nIf this is a persistent issue for you I might recommend moving away from Taric. Taric is a great champion with a game changing ultimate but his other abilities are relatively weak and he is very team reliant, especially when it comes to actually making good use of that invulnerability. Picking a champion with greater individual strengths or very clear tells to the team (nothing says 'go in and kill them now' like an aoe stun) might be good for you in the long run.\n\nMages are notorious for still being rather powerful even when played support, they have crowd control and still put out decent aoe damage. Or if you want to stay tank Leona, Braum, and Nautilus all are very durable and come with lots of cc.\n\nOf course if you really like Taric just ignore this last part, but he is very team reliant and if your team's performance is stressing you out to much it might be something to consider.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rengar vore","date":"2017-03-06T23:03:15.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*/mute all*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2017-03-06T22:41:23.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"420 blaze it","replies":[]},{"poster":"FurriesAreHot","date":"2017-03-06T21:59:52.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I dont see toxicity on that level very often.
