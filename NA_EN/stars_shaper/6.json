When the twins were born, they had some of her Celestial power, but were not technically \"Aspects\" and didn't have a Celestial being using them as a mortal vessel. \n\nBut the OP is right in how Morgana and Kayle view their Celestial power. Morgana has rejected it, choosing to walk the mortal path, while Kayle has embraced her Celestial identity and seeks to become just like her mother as the Aspect of Justice. Kayle wants to do what her mother did, which includes suppressing her human emotions and pushing down any doubt that she might be wrong, in order to serve ultimate justice and protect the innocent. This is extra difficult for Kayle because she is still herself (unlike Mihira, her mother, who merged with the Celestial).","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2019-03-11T09:18:52.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So right now Kayle is close to become a real Celestial in a mortal body.\n\nThat could be intriguing as time passes by: Does her \"soul\" end up with all the other mortal ones in a cycle of reincarnation and such? If yes, does it mantain its \"celestial attributes\" once reincarnated? Or are them new Celestials to be added to the ranks?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"King Braum","date":"2019-03-05T22:59:46.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HalfTangible,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=esclNxZg,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-03-05T21:33:58.359+0000)\n>\n> The difference is that Kayle and Morgana are not Aspects; they are children born of an aspect.\n> \n> Kayle might have become the Aspect of Justice after her mother died, but that would be speculation.\n\nIm pretty sure both Kayle and Morgana are Aspects now that their mother died. With Kayle being the emotionless sword that stikes down those that break the law and Morgana the compassionate hand that helps those in need.","replies":[{"poster":"HalfTangible","date":"2019-03-05T23:57:47.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aspects are, as far as we can tell, singular beings.

It's not uncommon in mythos either to have multiple aspects of a certain thing represented by different embodiment. Such as Athena and Ares (and Aphrodite according to Spartan Mythos) both being gods of war but governing different aspect of it).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2019-03-05T22:42:31.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is exactly what I'd like to be explored more.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkSoul1994","date":"2019-03-11T09:33:22.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remember what Riot said about Ascended champions a while back?
