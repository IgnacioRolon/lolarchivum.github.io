[&gt;link&lt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/VarusMains/comments/7gnmnc/ama_were_the_rioters_behind_the_update_to_varus/dqkgkv3/)\n\n> When we looked at telling this story, we quickly realised that it was the loss that mattered, not necessarily 'who' was lost.\n\nYou guys (the writers) are indeed on point, but is there any **actual loss** in the new Varus Lore?\n\n- The Old Varus had his entire village destroyed, his family killed and his life surrended to the powers he embraced knowing that he will go on only until there will be a Noxian alive.\n- Val and Kai lost their bodies, fair and square, but that&#039;s it. None of them has died, Val family is alive and Noxus has been repelled.\n\nThe only thing that has some kind of tragedy is that they most likely will be consumed by the Darkin, but even then you try your best to show us that there is more than a chance for them to conquer the demon, this gives even less a sense of desperation and doesn&#039;t really give dept to the &quot;loss&quot; experienced.","replies":[{"poster":"ChompyWulf","date":"2017-12-04T17:34:24.591+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":1,"body":"Varus also lost some of his prowess and power. \nOriginal lore half the tragedy was he was capable of defending the temple, presumably alone.

But then he fails in a way that undermines that terrible sacrifice... He's done his duty to stand and guard the pit at awful cost...then releases the thing within it anyway... That seemed to invalidate and diminish his choice. After all, if you're gonna release the thing you've been guarding...why let your family die first?\n(https://www.reddit.com/r/VarusMains/comments/7gnmnc/ama_were_the_rioters_behind_the_update_to_varus/dqmolhk/)\n\nIn my opinion, this was one of the most interesting moments in the old lore for me. Varus made a terrible sacrifice that cost the lives of his family, but ultimately found himself unable to live with it, and, in his despair, made a decision that ultimately rendered his great sacrifice moot. This is what made the character incredibly tragic, very flawed, and very human to me. That the only thing this rioter took away from that was that it \"invalidated his choice\" completely baffled me.","replies":[{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-12-05T07:19:38.499+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well Valmar's choice is invalidated. He wanted to save Kai, but now they are both trapped! The choice he wanted to make is now causing him problems.\n\nI have actually never thought of it in this way. So that kind of captures a similarity to the old story (apparently by accident on Riot's part). But the original story the decision and knowing the outcome was the critical factor, not the invalidated choice lol.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2017-12-04T23:19:27.562+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":6,"body":"There is loss here. The loss of your freedom, your body, and the ability to experience life with your loved ones. Kai and Val lost all of this because a) Kai was going to die anyway, and b) a demon took control of what remaining life they have left, if they cannot suppress Varus entirely. It's a very different kind of loss, because death is not the only kind of loss one can suffer.","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2017-12-04T23:40:54.569+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"But also Old Varus experienced it and plus his wasn't going to get fixed.

When I think about loss I think about something that is permanent, and can't be reversed. Something you have to deal with.\n\nThe tragedy of Varus was that he lost his family due to a decision he regretted almost immediately, but at that point it was already too late to change anything. That was the basis of his character and his motivations.\n\nKai and Val on the other hand are explicitly given a chance at recovery/redemption from their ordeal. It's possible that years later they might look back and be like \"hey, remember that one time we were in a body with a demon? lol\". Their story feels more like an adventure than a tragedy. That's a really drastic change in direction imo.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2017-12-05T00:56:07.604+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"One thing that a lot of people seem to forget:\nVarus the darkin lost his whole species(except for himself and 4 others).\nHe might be a ruthless monster,but he is clearly mourning the death of his kind.\nThe new lore just never really goes into detail about this,as Varus himself feels almost like a side character in his own lore,since big lore piece mainly focuses on Valmar(kai himself doesn't really get that much attention either).\n\nThough I do think that Valmar not loosing his family is part of the problem.\nI mean the talk he had with his mother after Varus took their bodies was actually quite an emotional moment in my opinion and I reallly liked it....but I also feel like it weakens the previous part of the story and it is drastically different from the lore of old Varus.","replies":[{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-12-05T07:20:39.105+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think anyone is forgetting about Varus.\n\nIt is as you said, the story never focuses on him.

Unlike Kayn who took Rhaast and is fighting for control of the power, Varus (assuming he had the same lore) could have been expanded on that he is fighting with the Darkin to control his sense of self, that unlike Kayn he would want to rid himself of the Darkin and its power after he has revenge.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Boulderox","date":"2017-12-05T01:29:47.269+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think there is a point where the old lore was short, quick, to the point, his thought process is relatable and understandable.\n\nThe new lore just has a lot of Grey area, Why did they both jump in? Suicidal pact? what happens if they actually fight off varus? do they share a body? do they go back to one dying and one not? Is hindering varus a good thing if in doing so varus could be killed and all 3 die as a result? \n\nThe only motivation the hunters have in the lore is each other, whereas the old lore his motivation was revenge and vengence, and was his choice.\n\n>Varus had nothing to lose when he gave himself to Pallas.\n\nThat was the point, but there are ways you can make that story better, such as the host ACCEPTING the darkin, and because of it isn't consumed, old varus wished he could save his family, but the darkin has family too, and can be an ally to the darkin varus. Nothing to lose is one thing, but everything to gain is something that can be added in some way.\n\nJust as {{champion:141}} assumably doesn't have his left side like that normally and was caused by Rhaast's influence, it isn't against the question that he may have become the host, but after enough time fighting it, he ends up overcoming the darkin through willpower.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2017-12-05T00:45:26.268+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't mean to be that guy, but it's critique, not critic.\n\nCritic would be a person who **_critiques_**.","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2017-12-05T08:03:06.869+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for being that guy xD","replies":[]}]}]}
