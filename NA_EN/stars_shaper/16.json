Something important that is missing.  The city was _rioting_ and was already destroying itself.  Morgana apparently did nothing to stop it.\n\nRemember that the lores are going to be effectively from the respective champion's standpoint.  From Morgana's standpoint, she had to protect.  Was that really what happened?  Probably not.  She probably could've stopped him in a non-violent way or protected via a shield.  Instead, she incinerated him and in the aftermath, the whole city went into chaos and rioting.  Kayle came to restore order and, from her perspective, saw her sister as the instigator.  If you had a crazy power filled sibling that appeared to have killed someone for no reason and was causing an entire city to revolt and act on their dark emotions and instincts, wouldn't you try to stop her?  For the good of the world and to keep the destruction from spreading?\n\nThere's an important thing that a lot of people are ignoring from Kayle's lore -- Kayle was compassionate too.  She didn't have to listen to Morgana; she could've smited everyone that violated the law despite what Morg pleaded.  She didn't though and it was her followers that didn't like this.  She chose to be merciful to those that pleaded to her sister.  If that isn't showing that she isn't some villainous harbinger of destruction to anyone who is out of line, I don't know what is.\n\nHonestly, it feels like the whole Boards wants to rant about Kayle being evil and Morg being good without looking at the full picture.  I had the same arguments with a bunch of people that believed Ezreal was a psychopath/sociopath and only once they saw the full picture did it become clear that he wasn't.\n\nKayle and Morgana are a split of an aspect and it makes sense that they are two sides of one whole.  The Star Wars analogy is good with the whole Dark/Light side.  The Aspect of Justice is two parts -- lawful and compassionate, strict and merciful -- at the same time.  Being twins born of an aspect, each inherited one of the traits.  Kayle is the lawful, strict, righteous justicator that has to hold the higher standard at the cost of her own emotions, feelings, and desires.  Morgana is the merciful, human aspect that recognizes the burden that humanity bears and does so at the cost of realizing what is actually right and necessary to keep the world in order and justice preserved.  Together, they balance each other out, but without each other, each falls prey to the extreme of their side.  Because we are humans, we readers will automatically sympathize with the more human aspect and thus assume they are good when that is not necessarily the case.\n\nNeither are good, neither are bad.  Both are just doing what instincts they were born with and being separated by the treachery that Ronas committed, they can no longer balance each other as they always did.  \n\nKayle is \"good\"; she uphold the laws and justice of the universe and if she doesn't the world will descend into rioting and chaos resulting in nothing but death and destruction.  Kayle is \"evil\" in that she smites people without question to cleanse the sin that she, being righteous, cannot tolerate and levels whole cities to bring order.\n\nMorgana is \"good\" as she understands humanity and has a deep connection with human emotions that allows her to understand and help those that wish to atone.  Morgana is \"evil\" in that she does not stop the chaos and focuses too much on her own emotions, bitterness, thoughts, and feelings to see what things need to be done in order to keep the world from anarchy.\n\nDoes that make sense?","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2019-02-19T23:10:24.949+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"It makes sense yes but not with the magnitude you are giving it.\n\nOnce again, did Kayle decide to sedate the revolt? No she was going to eradicate the entire population. Was Kayle compassionate? Yes but only through Morgana's pleads. I even liked that part, it looked like the 2 were in a good and constructive relationship.\n\nAs others have pointed out, Kayle zealotry was always a branch of her character but it was in contrast with the dismay and destruction that Morgana brought. Now she falls into it with a really weak trigger and at such an extreme that it overwrites a lot of her good doing.\n\nWhat I am finding oversatured with is that the \"light\" side is now only a bunch of totaitarists and zealots with half the redeeming factors of the \"dark\" side and this is happening in almost every situation. They said they just wanted to shaken up things but they just inverted the roles, creating new 2-dimensional tropes of \"the good which is really just as evil, if not more, of the actual evil\".\n\nI bet that if you gave the 2 bios to ppl who don't know about Kayle and Morgana and censor all the parts where they are described physically you'll get that ppl would draw Kayle as the demonic figure and Morgana like some sort of caring angel.

You did good on 2 dimensional stuff with Kayle making her just a zealot.\n\nThe thing is, light can be blinding, and Kayle took her \"justice\" to an extreme measure. Not only that, but the one thing to keep in mind was that angels were never \"human\" to begin with as they always had an air of distance.  And if you think about the light and dark when it comes to humanity, I want you to really take a moment and look at where we are on the spectrum as a race.\n\nif a being of darkness and a being of light approaches, we all know what we SHOULD theoretically say. \"The light.\"  But when it comes to people in emotional turmoil, angsty teenagers, or any random sarcastic internet troll will tell you: \"We gravitate towards the dark.\"\n\nSo for \"The Light\" to be the super good in our minds, the dark would have to be stereotypical evil damnation. And Netflix still have to tell people that TED BUNDY IS NOT A SEXUAL ICON! He's a serial killer.\n\n___\n\nThat, and if you want to wash any of that away, we can always look at it as an \"Era of Times.\"  If you think about comics in the 50s, it was so black and white with \"Good is Good\" and \"Evil is Evil\" that there is no confusion.  For this era of writing, it's possible that this writing isn't actually \"better\" but more servicable of the collective consciousness of morality and what is considered good or evil. Or simply \"good writing vs bad writing.\"\n\nAfterall, we still have people who hates anything with super heroes cussing, even if it would have made sense for their personality.  We all know how much a person can swear in a typical day let alone hour long conversation. Just one swear word, and hell breaks loose.","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2019-02-19T20:37:58.140+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"This can happen once or twice, not all the friggin times.\nThe did it with God King Garen, they did it with ALL of Demacia, they did it now with Kayle.
