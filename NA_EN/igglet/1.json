Yes and no.\n\nOn one side you have a higher chance of winning the game of champion select. When I play support I try to counter the whole team- it's easy to nullify me. My midlaner sees you've gone Ziggs, and counterpicks you, when they infact get counterpicked. The toplaner counterpicks your Nasus support, when they also get counterpicked. Once you've won this game, be sure to act like it was superior skills, <sarcasm>because it totally was.</sarcasm>\n\nOn the other side, botlane is not stupid- the ADC is literally everyone's favourite target and we _know_ this. When faced with something unknown, wombo-combo or with high kill potential we go defensive. And we can farm or pull of a 'sustain' lane. Even against Ziggs. Yes, playing defensively is stupifyingly boring, you've ruined the game for us and we might just FF so we can -leave- (congrats?)
