Your \"kryptonite\". I&#039;m not talking about the stereotypical {{champion:17}}, {{champion:92}}, {{champion:157}}  and {{champion:126}}, because, let&#039;s be honest here, everyone hates them. No, I am talking about the champion that you personally hate playing against, so much so that you consider dodging when you see the enemy team pick him, and even tryhard your ass off in Normals just to win lane against that champion.\n\nFor me, personally, it&#039;s {{champion:50}}. If any of my friends (all 2 of them :^) ) want to trigger me, they say the name *Swain*. If one of my friends wants to destroy our friendship, he picks Swain. And it all actually started when I was low level, played a champion I had no idea how to play as and got matched against a High-Elo Swain player who I had no idea how to play against. \n(Do keep in mind, this isn&#039;t a hate thread on Swain, it&#039;s just that I have no idea how to play against him ~~yes it is a hate thread Rito pls remove~~)","replies":[{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2016-11-18T20:40:26.221+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know this is super cliche and not expected, but a good {{champion:157}} just fucks me up and forces me under tower in every matchup, no matter if it's top or mid.
