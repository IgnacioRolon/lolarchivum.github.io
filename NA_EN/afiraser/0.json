I bought 2 skins on discount and i selected them and played the first game with them. The problem is that on the next game and every other game i had to select them again (aka. they couldn&#039;t be selected as deafult skin). Now i am not sure if the new season brought a new way of selecting default skins that i didn&#039;t notice (but the skins i bought last season are always selected by default) or it is just a bug with lunar revel (because i didn&#039;t buy any skins other than the ones in lunar shop), but i would like for riot to fix that bug because most of the times i forget to take the skins and i played more games without skins than with them.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-22T21:08:19.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Afiraser -\n\nThanks for the report! This isn't an issue with just the Lunar Revel skins, but skin selection in general. We're aware of the issue and are working on a fix!","replies":[]}]}
