Her lanephase is already the weakest phase of the game for her (constant threat of ganks, lack of proper vision and extreme mana issues) and once the time comes where she's supposed to shine she still can't do anything due to her horrendous handicaps. \n\nIf she tries to keep a safe distance, she won't be there at the crucial part of the teamfight due to her immobility. If she tries to stay in range of the action, she'll get focused down and dies immediately. The risk/reward ratio is entirely skewed to her disadvantage, she just isn't worth the trouble of playing if you'll never get to do what she's actually supposed to do.\n\nBoth situations are simply bad for her and your team won't even try to peel for you once things get hot, they'd much rather protect their adc. Cassiopeia's current kit just doesn't work for a lategame hypercarry, she'd need far more safety and range to make up for her inherent squishyness to be even considered a viable pick in that role.\n\nOld Cass was literally capable of melting entire teams with her poison-damage, now THAT was some true hypercarry stuff. It's incredible to see by how much they missed their goal with this rework just to ditch her afterwards as if nothing happened. We've yet to see any compensation for this. \n\nAlso new Cass skin when?

I really have no idea how he works since his rework).\n\nThat would probably mean reducing her dependency on AP scaling and increasing her base damages at high level somehow. Given that dps champs generally deal most of their damage to tanks, some kind of %hp/true damage/resistance shred (things that Vayne and Kog'maw get!) on her poisons would be very effective and also feel flavorful. I think this kind of effect from aspect stacks would also feel way more like a reward than AP boosts which feel like you just don't have your real AP ratios at the start of the game. Increasing the base on her heal and reducing or removing the ratio would also keep Cass from feeling like she NEEDS to go full AP.\n\nThen this bruiser/tankbuster Cass would be a champ that can stand to get close enough to a team fight to actually use her spells, doesn't feel like she needs to hit the back line to make a real difference, and genuinely requires some focus fire to bring down, making her actually feel like a hyper carry.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Queen Viper","date":"2015-12-20T13:28:01.732+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Old video is old... it's pre-season now, things changed.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lhostalis","date":"2015-12-20T03:40:29.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm a dirty casual, but from reading you post and drawing from my own limited knowledge of the game she sounds vaguely like AP vayne.

Then she got nerfed out of proplay by nerfing her mana pool early, if I recall correctly.

Then she got nerfed out of proplay by nerfing her mana pool early, if I recall correctly.

She has several counters: CC her from outside her mediocre range, mobility to jump on top of her and dodge her skillshots, burst her down before she can deal dps, or just make her suffer so much in the early game that she'll never recover. When there are so many paths to victory against her and those paths are things that teams already want to build to do, then pretty much every comp is a \"counter\" to her, and her winrate only goes up when her numbers are so high that she can just ignore any of the ways you're supposed to beat her.\n\nThe best comparison is kog'maw. He also has a weak early game that builds into lategame dps. But his range is off the scale: His autos are comparable to Cass's twin fang but don't require that setup where you land a skillshot first, his other abilities are even longer range, his R starts at more than 50% more range than that and increases to over 2.5x her range, not only that but his slow field is much larger and his passive (as hated as it is) makes it hard to dive him without getting killed yourself.\n\nYou can still work to shut him down in the early game, or you can dive him and get a pretty secure kill (but you really need a lot of mobility to also get out without getting killed yourself), but trying to burst or cc him at range just doesn't work because you're in range of him waaaay before you can reasonably land your cc. This means there are a bunch of comps where his life is legitimately easy, and when his numbers are to the point where he can win in those cases, his winrate goes up without having to get his numbers into the stratosphere so he can also survive an Insec kicking him into a gangbang.","replies":[{"poster":"Sasogwa","date":"2015-12-20T01:37:36.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Quepha,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=GEWyMjl4,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2015-12-20T01:24:54.669+0000)\n>\n> I think being so oppressive when viable is a product of her fundamentally flawed kit.

However, Kog'maw doesn't have to land skillshots to use his autos, his window for getting off dps is longer and can start on demand, he is locked down for a smaller period of time on each auto, if he accidentally fires an auto at a non poisoned minion he won't be locked out of his auto attacks for 4 seconds, and his slow field is MUCH larger which makes covering that range between him and you much more difficult.\n\nAnd I don't think his ult should be so casually dismissed, being able to soften up your targets from a whopping 1800 range is huge when you're a dps champion, because every point of hp taken off before the fight adds up to seconds earlier you will win the fight. Cass's Q doesn't have that kind of range, and its damage is pathetic unless you're also connecting with twin fangs.\n\nCass's tools for a fight that she has but Kog'maw does not are the MS boost on her Q and her Ult. Her ult is ridiculously predictable and when the enemy is within that range of you, a slow often is not enough to save you. Her ms boost also isn't that helpful because it means you have to land your skillshots: miss one and you're up shit creek since you can't go at the speed you need or even deal any damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Sasogwa","date":"2015-12-20T02:04:21.751+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Quepha,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=GEWyMjl4,comment-id=0005000000000000,timestamp=2015-12-20T01:51:01.276+0000)\n>\n> I agree, those are very similar, although 710 is technically farther (I assume full rank because both champs are advertised as late game hypercarries).

She also works kind of like a juggernaut in which she sits near the ADC and zones you away from them, killing you if you try to dive.

She has her niche, she's just not good enough at it atm. \n\nWhat would you suggest for another rework? I was thinking of maybe putting her damage in landing Qs. Maybe E now keeps someone poisoned for a little bit longer, and Qing a poisoned target does extra damage.
