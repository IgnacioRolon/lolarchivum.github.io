What are or aren&#039;t you happy with? her gameplay? her itemization? her model? her splash art?\n\nPerhaps you could comment on the years without skins? Her play patterns? Her power curve? Her niches? The massive amount of hatred she&#039;s received since her rework? Her almost universally hated passive? The way her rework was handled with zero respect for the people providing feedback and huge gaps in communication from Reds? How it felt rushed out for the Shurima event like Reds have admitted Azir&#039;s release was rushed?\n\nNot long ago there was also a large post made about the Fiora rework and how it was received from both a gameplay and an art standpoint. The Cassiopeia rework is older than Fiora&#039;s and also generated quite a bit of buzz, it seems that would be worthy of its own post or even ANYTHING AT ALL.","replies":[{"poster":"Spoofghoul","date":"2016-01-05T21:13:09.890+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is a cassiopeia?\n\nWe talking about a starsystem? \n\nlast i checked this was league boards not star citizen forum . .","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2016-01-05T19:39:12.867+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot hates Lamia-kin.\n\nPls, think of the Lamia !

But I think Cassi needs to be rethought, replanned and it probably is better that when they start working on her, they take their time to secure they'll deliver a good project. That way the fiasco her rework was won't be repeated. Really, they need to focus on her deeply if they are going to change her.

She wasn't reading what she was supposed to. She was supposed to be super hate-able and arrogant. If league was a movie she would be a villain for sure. Her design didn't read that and just kind of read Pretty lady with a sword. Unfortunately for riot people liked pretty lady with a sword better. I appreciate riots attempt to try and make her appearance line up more with her character. Did they do it perfectly? No not really but Fiora seems like such a fractured character to me now. She doesn't truly deliver on any theme now because of them coming half way. Honestly I kind of want them to split her into two, one of them being arrogant, snobby Fencer lady and the other being pretty but deadly princess of the sword kind of person.","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-01-06T16:21:46.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CoTheSlow,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xAQsyjlt,comment-id=000400000000,timestamp=2016-01-06T12:58:15.108+0000)\n>\n> She was supposed to be super hate-able and arrogant.

The art team seemed to be on a completely different page from lore and the players.\n\nBut more importantly, that isn't what she means to people who actually play Fiora and all Riot had to do was show the sketches to a single player and they'd get all the feedback they need, \"That doesn't look like Fiora.\" And they could have saved a ton of time, money, and effort.","replies":[{"poster":"CoTheSlow","date":"2016-01-06T16:52:55.116+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Quepha,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xAQsyjlt,comment-id=0004000000000000,timestamp=2016-01-06T16:21:46.356+0000)\n>\n> Then she should have been from Noxus instead Demacia and her lore should have been about arrogance and skill instead of defying arranged marriages and earning back her family's honor.

The rework I feel did a lot to make her more sympathetic lore wise (which I personally wasn't a fan of for what I thought Fiora was, even though it is fine). Whereas her old lore I feel tried to read more egotistical. \"Fiora's ego would be insufferable if it wasn't so... justified.\" I also feel they changed the lore so she would be more likable, because you know. People have to want to play her. She can't just be an Ultra diva. \n\nI never said riot handled it right, just that I appreciated the thought on why they wanted to change it. I appreciated that they wanted her design to match her character, it was just the wrong character. Had they shown sketches to the community I think we would have been able to find a happy medium and if not that then it would be no worse than what we currently have or scrapped it all together and given her a texture rebalance. To me it just feels kind of like Cass. Riot wants her to be one thing but the community doesn't so we get a kind of half and half mess that doesn't really make anyone super happy. I liked the idea but the execution was flawed. They have apparently learned from it so we shall see what they do.","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-01-06T17:14:31.521+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CoTheSlow,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xAQsyjlt,comment-id=00040000000000000000,timestamp=2016-01-06T16:52:55.116+0000)\n>\n> They have apparently learned from it so we shall see what they do.\n\nSaying they learned from it does not mean they actually learned from it.

The ADC rework didn't have too many casualty's, and gave some cool new kit designs that fit the characters. I just think that the community and riot just sometimes have different perceptions on what a character should be and sometimes the community view changes over time (Cass as a poison mage over E spam, and pretty Fiora over pretentious) riot's view of the character doesn't and so we get lost in translation a little. Judging by the backlash all these projects got I don't think Riot is looking to make anymore mistakes like this again. They have even been a little better in dealing with the Morde fallout than with Cass.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Darthkor","date":"2016-01-05T12:10:14.932+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGSKrC7dGcY","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-01-06T06:32:24.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Darthkor,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xAQsyjlt,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-01-05T12:10:14.932+0000)\n>\n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGSKrC7dGcY\n\nnot available in my country...","replies":[{"poster":"Darthkor","date":"2016-01-07T13:13:17.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Quepha,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xAQsyjlt,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-01-06T06:32:24.389+0000)\n>\n> not available in my country...\n\nenjoy the silence depech mode","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2016-01-06T13:53:32.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Title of song explains it all :P","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CoTheSlow","date":"2016-01-06T12:48:34.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it possible she is a contender to get one of the 'immobile mage' reworks?
