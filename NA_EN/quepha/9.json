That being said, it is more justifiable on her because she is a squishy champion that, once closed upon, is likely to die.  This is VERY different from the tanks like Sejuani and Skarner who had their permaslow abilities removed.  \n\nContinuing from there, they have preserved Ashe's E as a non-combat ability.  Therefore, she only has 3 as opposed to the usual 4 that adc's have. Now her passive could be considered that 4th ability, but that is debatable for a number of reasons.  \n\nI don't think this rework has taken Ashe too far from what she is currently.  Her ability to slow opponents is still intact.  Her ability to scout the map has been improved.  Her ultimate is intact, as you mentioned.  Her W fills the exact same role.  She still lacks any form of mobility and doesn't have a real escape of any kind.  The biggest change she is receiving is her Q (of course) and she needs an ability like this to be able to even lane against other adc's.

This is perfectly in line with op.gg saying; that over the last month Ashe has averaged 3rd best.

Her win rate even with those not experienced with her in plat+ is still also well over 50%. She wins over 50% against every adc.\n\nhttp://champion.gg/champion/Ashe\n\nSo, yes, Ashe can compete with other adcs when played properly.

Even at 100% crit, the first attack never crits unless you hit volley/arrow first. Her slow and everything actually makes for a very different experience between balancing damage and crit chance. No other marksmen has that type of constant slow, crit, or utility in that style of combination.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Huudi","date":"2015-04-30T04:20:39.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I really disagree, i think this is a pretty original ADC package, from the lack of crit to the Q active.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UberAffe","date":"2015-04-30T04:15:02.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"the slow gets up to about 65% with her q active, that is a very relevant slow","replies":[]}]}
