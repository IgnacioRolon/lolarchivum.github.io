Riot literally said \"oops\".\n* Cassiopeia's rework was put on the PBE. Players on the PBE said it didn't feel like cassiopeia, nor did it feel fun. Players noticed there was a glitch with her cooldowns that destroyed her dps... riot released it in the initial state and she was literally unplayable for weeks, and then only figuratively unplayable for months (and still is) as she's been basically going through another full rework's worth of changes. I like how gutting her happened in the blink of an eye but you guys are being super cautious about fixing her, you wouldn't want cass players to start having fun again too soon.\n* Azir was incredibly buggy on the PBE, people were sure that he would need more time before release because he was completely unplayable... riot released him on schedule and has been fixing about 10% of his bugs every patch while also giving him numbers buffs to compensate for the rest of his bugs, so when his bugs ARE fixed he'll need to be nerfed again.\n* The new jungle was on the PBE, everyone said it was way too hard except for a select few sustain junglers... riot released it as-is and warwick is DESTROYING THE GAME IN ITS CURRENT STATE. Riot says they want to nerf warwick because he's obscuring everything that's going on, but it's obvious that stuff like udyr and volibear are only right behind him and they're going to need at least one more cycle of whack-a-mole before they can actually look at how the new jungle does and does not support different jungler champions. so we're looking at like 2 or 3 more full patch cycles before riot even starts to look at the new jungle in a proper ~~test~~ live setting for balance. doesn't the next season actually have to start some time?\n\nA while ago Riot said they would start using the PBE to test much more dramatic changes and players shouldn't be alarmed because they were going to still be cautious with their testing. I believed them for exactly one patch cycle when i was wandering around forums telling people to ease up because of what riot had just said, and every change went through exactly like it was on the PBE, so I guess riot just forgot about that new policy.\n\nI don't know if Riot doesn't choose proper test samples for their PBE group, or if players don't test properly because it isn't worth their time to play long league matches without IP rewards on their main account, or if the matchmaking is just thrown to shit because you have a smaller player pool, but it feels like Riot has been increasingly using the PBE as a scapegoat for awful changes that ruin the game because \"we get better data in the first few hours on live than we do from weeks on the PBE\"\nMaybe that means your PBE is fucked up and you need to figure out how to do testing so your live game will stop feeling like your testing ground.","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2014-11-30T19:44:50.949+0000","up_votes":53,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another point that I didn't think was worthy of the OP:\nIf Riot is increasingly depending on the live environment to test changes, then why are new or recently reworked champs available in ranked while old and balanced champs are not available in ranked while on free week? there are literally zero arguments that apply to disabling free week champs that don't apply to disabling newly released champs.","replies":[{"poster":"DUDE BRO","date":"2014-12-01T05:32:16.910+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Also, with {{item:3718}}, warwick **immediately gets +400 damage to his ult the moment he turns lvl 6.**","replies":[{"poster":"WiegrafOfValor","date":"2014-12-14T23:36:38.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"40 x 5 = 200","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2014-12-02T03:17:59.436+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Another point that I didn't think was worthy of the OP:\n> If Riot is increasingly depending on the live environment to test changes, then why are new or recently reworked champs available in ranked while old and balanced champs are not available in ranked while on free week? there are literally zero arguments that apply to disabling free week champs that don't apply to disabling newly released champs.\n\nThere is at least one such argument: make people spend ip/rp to pay anything in ranked.

Past that, yes, nothing gets \"changed\" or \"fixed\" on the PBE as a result of the PBE input from the players. \n\nI know Riot has taken the stance that data overrules opinions and \"feel\" but I thought the whole point of the PBE was to fix the \"feel\" of things before going to Live. i.e. the OP's examples. \n\nHonestly, the PBE is essentially a 2-week window to what Live will look like in the next patch. It does not perform its purpose of \"beta-ing\" anything. If it were to receive an accurate label, it would be the **\"pre-live assembly zone\"** because that's what it functions as. Stuff gets loaded up and assembled for going to live, and if they can't make something work, they take it off.

Riot needs to change how the PBE works and have longer testing cycles before release, ESPECIALLY on new/updated champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2014-12-01T01:38:36.007+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you, sir, deserve an upvote.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ULTRAF0RCE","date":"2014-12-01T02:39:30.782+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well they have tested the range change on quinn on pbe multiple times and haven't released it so that is an example of a test that hasn't yet been released","replies":[]},{"poster":"FantasySniper","date":"2014-11-30T23:03:26.470+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, a lot of things go through without proper bug-testing, let alone balance-testing.\n\nBut it's all for **SHURIMA**{{champion:268}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2014-11-30T21:21:21.960+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"They always wanted the jungle to be difficult and they actually did listen to concerns. They buffed Machete, lowered camp damages and improved smite bonuses and jungle items before releasing it onto the live servers.\n\nYou need to understand that it makes sense for Riot to be overly skeptical of feedback from those who use the PBE since its such a small sample of players compared to the millions that will test it within hours of it being released. The same thing could be said about the forums, its a very small sample of people and it does honestly seem like Riot just kinda fake nods and rolls their eyes at it considering they just view it as a vocal minority.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Damorion215","date":"2014-12-01T07:47:20.751+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Just another point in showing how Riot doesn't care about the community.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tapu Fini","date":"2014-11-30T22:25:30.964+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"This kind of crap has been happening at *least* as far back as Karma. She hit the PBE and within a week or two went live, with absolutely no player feedback taken in. This is nothing new, and it sucks. Once it's on the PBE, it is absolutely not being touched beyond minor tweaks (Numbers, colors, little things like that.)\n\nThey say they don't want the PBE to be a place for people to see the content ahead of time, but that's what they're making it by refusing to hear the playerbase's opinions.","replies":[]}]}
