It's a little on the jarring side for Cassiopeia, especially when it's the enemy champion who is inflicted with the Poison and not herself.\n\n\nInstead of a Passive that very gradually makes Cassiopeia be better at throwing her oversized fangs, how about one that punishes the opponent for getting Poisoned repeatedly instead?\n---------------\nTo put it into comparison.\n\nHow does **Thresh** grow stronger?

I have butted heads with you in the past but by being condescending towards your playerbase that cares is not the way you should be communicating, just look at the Lore incident. You know this and may even get mad about me saying this but as most in the game industry have to be reminded is that Game design is a two way street, you're not making the game for yourselves, you are making the game for the consumers. If it ever becomes hard to understand the reasons for why the players are angry or have so many complaints about these topics and difficult for you to put yourself in their shoes, you should probably take a break from the normal routine and do as these players do to understand why they are feeling like they are. What I mean by this is even if you hate the game mode force yourself to like it (thats what we have to do in the service industry) and do what you can to be a part of that community. An excellent example would be the Dominion community which was told they would be talked to more but were abandoned FAR before worlds started.

Why?\n\nBecause everything is tied to Twin Fangs. With no damage in Q and W, you force a player to sit there like a turret and fire Twin Fangs off. That is as **Binary** as you get.\n\nAtleast with the old Cassiopeia I could weave in spells like a mad man trying to juggle moments and windows with an occasional twin fang because it was ***suicide*** to stand there for too long trying to use more then one twin fangs.\n\n**Three:**\n\nI've said before and I'll say it again.\n\nSo long as Cassiopeia has this passive: \"Aspect of the Serpent\"\n\nShe will *never* (Yes, I said never) be able to function better as a champion, simply because you guys have added a gating mechanic that also grants additional AP.\n\nIt won't matter if she gains percentage AP or Flat AP. The fact the passive has this means you arbitrarily have hold back her AP ratios which prevent her from ever seeing the light of day.\n\nYou might now think that taking away her AP gains from a passive might be a great choice, but it doesn't end there.\n\nThe fact that you guys also arbitrarily added spell vamp and cool down reduction is just a face palm.\n\nIts like you guys watched a season 2 Cass player like Scarra (or Reginald I can't remember who started it) play her with Will of the ancients/Hextech Revolver and thought it was great to have and decided to throw it in for Season 4 on Cassiopeia.\n\nSpell Vamp is junk on her, I'm sorry. If it was sustain your looking for, its pennies compared to what ADC's can get from lifesteal and even then you never live long enough to make use of that spell vamp because its pitiful since any player worth his salt knows if you get on top of a Cassiopeia player she will get deleted.\n\nonto the Cooldown, Why? I mean, just why?  You guys again increased her cooldowns and arbitrarily increased her cooldowns all on her spells which once she gets that certain point of CDR. She gets old cass cooldown times which is just a slap in the face.\n\nCooldown on her only helped getting faster Ults, it was not valued as high and still isn't worth it now.\n\n\n**Four:**  Since she no longer has Deadly Cadence, you severely underestimate how much she needs it because of how spammy in nature her kit is. The fact that you made everything kit focused onto her Twin fangs, makes it even **MORE** known of how quickly she relies on her Mana passive since her new kit just now calls for more SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM.","replies":[{"poster":"Khell DarkWolf","date":"2014-10-29T11:45:26.562+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"And to my follow up since I have no space.\n\nShe is in a bad state, but the fact you guys think number tweaking can fix this will never hit the mark.\n\nThe fact you don't see an overhaul needed and aren't even considering how underestimating how bad this passive is just disappointing to hear. And I'm sure other Cass mains from before can agree with me on that.\n\nThe only thing this rework solidifies, are the players that rely dove into max skill point using Twin Fangs more often when the dynamics of the Champion (Cass) were far more greater then that which was taken away from us with this Rework.\n\nI mean I could point you into the direction of my other post in the thread for a suggestion of a rework concept:http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/gFME3v51-on-the-future-of-cassiopeia-also-some-background?comment=000a\n\nAtleast it was a try to appease both parties in the player base with a concept I through out.\n\nYou may think lane bullying is terrible, maybe so. But a good early game is all about the game from the perspective of playing that champion.\n\nI just can't believe you would say she was absurd pre-update with being a real jerk. Did you not realize she actually has many hard match ups that actually was bullying to her? more so now in this Season because of the way people play their champions?\n\nShe was no more a lane bully then a fizz on the opposing side, because for her to bully she has to get out there and risk it.\n\nBut nowadays, every other champion you see are much more a bully to her then she is perceived to be and this is Pre-work Cass I'm talking about.\n\nTaking New cass now is just Suicide, and the very fact you have to stay mid to farm like an addict Feral Flare jungler is just terrible in conception and only encourages for your opponent to shat on you or if you play too safe they'll roam to get kills and hit the nail in the coffin to end it for you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AlphaSonic","date":"2014-10-29T10:36:41.470+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> A few things to note:\n> \n> * A champion like Casseopia, who has repeatable targeted damage, has very little dueling play other than fish and destroy.

And whoever else says that they \"worked\" (using \"worked\" lightly, threw darts at a board maybe?, spending time with the lore team doing nothing for 3 months? I don't know....) on this abysmal excuse of a rework. \n\nIt has been 3 months now that Cassiopeia has been garbage. And honestly, garbage is putting it lightly, she is one of, if not the WORST champion in the game. Saying this \"takes time\" is a joke, you have had plenty of time, your team rushed out a terrible rework, that the ENTIRE CASS PLAYER BASE (Save a select few, EXTREMELY SELECT few) hated, and pointed out EVERY flaw. Guess what, we got ignored, something Riot loves to do lately, ignore it's customers. But no, you can't continue working on anything during Worlds! Heaven forbid you don't get to enjoy your free month vacation/excuse to do nothing at all for no reason other than E-Sports. \n\nEvery flaw that we pointed out, every piece that didn't follow what Cass was and damaged the champion, ignored. End result, a rework that made her worse than Urgot. You took a champion with a 50% winrate, and made it >40%. Great job Rito, quality rework you did there. \n\nWe didn't even need another stacking champion, we have plenty of options for that! Not to mention it has to be the worst way to stack and tier a champion in the history of this game! It isn't rewarding until you hit 400 stacks 30min into the game. So you made a champion, that is a complete liability until 30minutes into the game, for a SLIGHT buff to lategame damage and a major nerf to the entire rest of the kit and game. \n\nI have played so much Cass post rework, unlike Stashu who doesn't seem to play her ever, before or after. I can personally tell you I have to work 10x harder than any other champion in those games to do OK. \n\nHer ult does not need to have a windup. THERE IS NO NEED FOR THIS. Annie gets tibbers ult, which does MORE damage, and does AOE stun, no matter where the enemy is facing, heaven help you if she flash ults you. And she does MORE damage overall until you get those garbage level stacks up to make your abysmal scaling do ANYTHING! She cannot lane, if you get someone who doesn't respect her stacking you can get lucky and get good stack numbers, until you get camped. I have had most success running her bot lane so I can have a support. THIS IS NOT how you should be FORCED to play a MID MAGE champion to make this garbage semi-viable. \n\nYou knew this rework was terrible before you released it, but you didn't care, who cares about your customers right, obviously not Riot games. We got ignored for 2 1/2 months, by your team, yourself and Stashu. Who never wanted to pony up and fix anything, just spewed the usual, \"Hey we missed the mark here, and are \"working\" (once again, used lightly) on it.\" \n\nYou need to work on champion testing on PBE and not pushing out garbage, when you push out garbage, and ignore garbage, don't be suprised when that champions player base becomes outraged. But oh wait, we aren't Lee Sin fans, so no one at Riot cares. We will get no compensation for the fact that you slit Cassiopeia's throat for 3+ months.
