The other 3 mission lines and Dailies are exclusive to the Dungeon Pass holders, and the Dailies can be started by anyone who bought either pass.","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-08-13T04:10:42.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good to know. I appreciate the clarification because the flavor text was a bit ambiguous on the announcement page. It stated that people who bought the dungeon pass would have access to daily missions but I don't think it mentioned anything about those who didn't buy it. I just sort of assumed we'd all be getting daily missions because of the VS event. Makes a lot more sense now though.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2017-08-12T05:02:17.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The daily missions are unlocked by purchasing one of the dungeon passes, either the mini one or the big one.
