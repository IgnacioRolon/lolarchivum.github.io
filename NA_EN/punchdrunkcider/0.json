When I move my mouse, the FPS drops to almost an unplayable level. When champions go into the fog of war, some visual effects will appear and then teleport to catch back up to the champ. Ive looked for the Stij.exe and it doesnt appear to be the issue. Any tips or tricks I can use to fix this would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PunchDrunkCider","date":"2017-06-08T18:12:33.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was speachRuntime.exe I believe. I would just close that and be fine. Really weird that it had that interaction. Windows 10, just went into task manager. I eventually figured it out after research. Sorry I never got back, thank you for the post. You can tell others that speachRuntime is/was an issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Cheerless","date":"2018-01-10T23:31:38.726+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont have speachruntime.exe or stij.exe\nwhat do i do","replies":[{"poster":"Randomxdlol","date":"2018-01-17T16:10:19.635+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"same here, need help","replies":[{"poster":"Ekiprax","date":"2018-01-19T19:17:48.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yep same this is really odd","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dr Dr Dirty","date":"2018-03-20T18:01:36.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I hope you could fix the error by now.\n\nI had a similar problem 2 days ago.

However, I saw a post similar to this and it said to run the League of Legends client as an administrator. I tried this, and I don't have the issue anymore. It may not work for you because not everybody has the exact same solution to a problem but at least try this and see if it works.","replies":[]}]}
