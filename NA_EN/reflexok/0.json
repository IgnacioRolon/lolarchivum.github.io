Contacted the league of legends support all I got is a message saying that they cant disscus this and my account wont be unbanned... still no reasons, because I was sure that I didnt did any bad thing and respected everything even thoo lets say for flamme, my friend got a 14 days ban for flamme but at least he got the chat logs and what he did..\r\nI totally got no informations, I did nothing I swear god after working hard years and paying a lot of money, sometimes I think that league of legends support are not humans they don't feel you, they are like robots...
