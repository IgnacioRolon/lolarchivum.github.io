This will occur for any player on sonas team who is in the black and white death screen, including sona herself\r\n\r\nrepro steps\r\n1. load a game on howling abyss using any champion (including sona herself)\r\n2. have a sona on your team using the DJ skin.\r\n3. Opt into her music via tab and clicking the music icon\r\n4. if you yourself die, the howling abyss &quot;death&quot; music will play along side sona&#039;s electronic music\r\n\r\nits worth noting that this will still happen if you are playing sona, though it becomes less dissonant because when she dies, some of her musical layers fall off. still kind of annoying.\r\n\r\npossible solution: do some programming magic that makes it so ALL howling abyss music files are disabled while opting into DJ sona&#039;s jams.\r\n{{champion:37}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-19T17:36:00.705+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Kenny Raccoons,\n\nThanks for the report!
