Passive takes 5 seconds to proc and only lasts for 10 seconds.(Passive only procs if in combat for at least 15 seconds) You can also see when Al'Xalio is going to have his passive when he a light rapidly blinks over him.\n\n**Q Ability - ** Void Binding - Al'Xalio throws out a skillshot nuke void-charged binding net, slowing the first enemy hit and dealing 20/35/50/75/120 magic damage. If \"Void Binding\" doesn't hit an enemy, it will explode at the end of its range, dealing 0.75% of the target's current health.   CD: 12/10/8/7/5\n\n**W Ability -** Void Haunting - (Passive and Active) In passive form, Al'Xalio gains 35 movespeed when out of combat. When activated, Al'Xalio gains 250 movespeed for 0.75 seconds, also gaining 25 armor and magic resistance for 4 seconds. If Al'Xalio kills an enemy champion while still having his bonus armor and magic resistance, he will reset his movespeed bonus (Can only happen 2 times). The passive of \"Void Haunting\" is lost when on cooldown.   CD: 25/20/18/15/13\n\n**E Ability -** Bloodcurdling Stare - Al'Xalio stares into the soul of his enemies, firing an AOE skillshot nuke in a selected area (800 pixels). 2 random enemy champions in the circle are snared for 1 second and are slowed tremendously (50% if max movespeed) for 0.50 seconds.   CD: 30/28/22/18/14\n\n**Ultimate Ability -** Void Horror - Al'Xalio charges up his void energy and fires it at a largely selected area (1000 pixels), dealing 150 true damage at all ranks, over a brief channel (1.5 seconds) . The damage can increased if by 10 damage every extra second (max 50 extra damage) he chooses to channel. He can do this by holding down the ultimate button for 1-5 extra seconds. In addition to all of this, Al'Xalio will teleport to a desired area after using his fully charged ultimate.\n\n**Primary Role** - Fighter\n**Secondary Role** - Assassin\n**Very similar play style to: {{champion:107}} and {{champion:121}}**\n\n**Pros -**\n**Very strong mid/late game**\n**Game-changing abilities**\n**Can still be useful if behind**\n**Easy to play**\n\n**Cons -**\n**VERY long cooldowns**\n**Can be useless if played wrong**\n**No sustain**\n\n**Quotes - **\n\n**When walking near low health enemy champions - **\n*\"Ha, ha, ha!\"*\n*\"Easy prey, easy day!\"*\n*\"(Scream in an abnormal, void-like voice)!\"*\n\n**When low health**\n*\"Hey, that hurt!\"*\n*\"Ouch,that wasn't pleasant!\"*\n*\"Not even close!\"*\n\n**Friends and Foes -**\n**Friends -** {{champion:96}} {{champion:31}} \n**Foes - ** {{champion:121}} {{champion:421}}\n\n**Quotes while near friends**\n\"Hello, friend!\"\n\"So how's it been ({{champion:96}} or {{champion:31}})!\n\n**Quotes while near foes**\n*\"Ugh, you again!\"*\n*\"Uh oh, here come's trouble.\"*\n*\"Don't worry, I won't kill you......yet!\"*\n\n\n**Lore (NOT FINAL) -**\n\n**Al'Xalio was a servant of {{champion:161}}'s. He had failed many tasks that were requested by {{champion:161}}, therefore {{champion:161}} was very disappointed and banished Al'Xalio. Al'Xalio, filled with rage, went on a long, treacherous journey across Valoran seeking any man willing to duel him. Slash, slash, Al'Xalio had easily defeated every enemy he encountered. Seeking even harder opponents, he wandered the unknown land and eventually came across the League Of Legends.**\n\n**LEAVE COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS BELOW! :-)**","replies":[{"poster":"CptPic4rd","date":"2015-03-20T18:30:18.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude you need to add some pictures.","replies":[]}]}
