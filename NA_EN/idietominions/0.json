Help!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every time I try to open up league, I have to click it, so that the league logo shows up, but the league client doesn’t, about 5-10 times until the client will finally open, and when I log in, after putting in my details, it will take 2 minutes to sign in ( it normally takes 10 seconds.) then when I finally get logged on in the clients, the overview doesn’t show up, you can’t click the play button ( its grey). My loot Andy store will show up tho. Pls help!! This shouldn’t be a wifi problem otherwise it would take so long to open","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-29T23:28:21.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Turn on \"low-spec mode\" in the client options and that should make things a bit smoother.
