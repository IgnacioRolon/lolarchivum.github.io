So i know that particles are out of the question. You have said so many times in other threads. But, Tibbers comes off as really plain looking to me. I'll be using Prom Queen Annie as an example for what I'm trying to say. So in Prom Queen Annie (I'll call it PQA for short) Annie looks pretty fancy, much like Sweeheart Annie does (I'll call this one SA) Now, While PQA does have the same relative fanciness in look for Annie, Tibbers goes well with it, wearing a top hat and jacket like a real gentleman (as seen above). SA on the other hand, has this fanciness applied to Annie, but not really to Tibbers. Sure, he's pink and looks like a Carebear, but he is overall really plain looking. SA Tibbers is lacking something to tie him in with SA Annie. PQA Annie is wearing green, but I'd like to point out that the good people at Riot didn't just turn Tibbers green and say \"that's good. He doesn't need anything else\". They made him look the part of Prom King. Now, looking at SA Tibbers, it doesn't appeal to the eye very well. Tibbers shade of pink isn't seen very much in Annie's dress for the SA skin. Tibbers seems to just be there, not actually apart of the skin. Sure, he looks cute, but he doesn't seem to be part of the SA skin. He's just too bright and too plain. My suggestion, is this: give Tibbers a hat, headband, vest, wings, or something of the like to give him that SA vibe and make him tie in better with the fanciness of Annie in the SA skin. I'd very much like Tibbers to blend with Annie a bit better in the skin. I would very much like this to be a skin i would buy. I want it part of my Annie skin collection, but as it stands right now, with Tibbers in this state, I can't see myself buying it and liking it.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time,\r\n\r\nPrinccessKairi","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-02-10T21:47:30.002+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya PrinccessKairi! \n\nThanks for taking the time to write out some feedback on Sweetheart Annie! \n\nFor a bit of context, we didn't want Tibbers to be the same color as Annie's dress, otherwise, when she's skipping around with him, he'd likely blend in to her outfit! With that being said, his color differentiation is a lot more noticeable once he's big! \n\nAs for Tibbers himself, we wanted him to be similar to a teddy bear you've give or receive on Valentine's Day! They're usually fairly simple, and have some sort of cute heart or saying on their belly.\n\nUnfortunately, it's a bit too late to make any changes to this skin, since there's scheduled maintenance for Patch 5.3 beginning tomorrow. D: I don't, however, want you to feel discouraged from posting your feedback, because your feedback is valid, and you explain it well! I would suggest getting your feedback on the boards as early as possible, because it gives us more time to discuss yours (and others'!) ideas, and potentially make changes!","replies":[{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2015-02-11T00:54:46.317+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=Qbm1NuJU,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-02-10T21:47:30.002+0000)\n>\n> As for Tibbers himself, we wanted him to be similar to a teddy bear you've give or receive on Valentine's Day!

Someone did some crazy fan art of ***a teddy bear you'd give or receive on Valentine's Day.*** There are thousands of these! Apparently, people call them Kindness Ursines or something. Maybe Compassion Cubs? I can't remember.\n\nhttp://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-3a_PULLdkA/TEOEejLWXbI/AAAAAAAAA30/B7rlUX2dNM4/s1600/care%20bear.gif\n\nSo, was Chosen Master Yi intended to be similar to some kind of hypothetical space samurai with, I don't know, maybe an energy sword? Like a…laser-rapier, or a beam-claymore, or…there's got to be a catchier word for that…\n\nAnd yes, this post is meant entirely in the spirit of :3\n\nI write League fanfiction, an inherently derivative genre. I don't hold a lack of \"originality\" against anyone, least of all Riot. (That's not meant sarcastically. I think the hunt for novelty is often misguided, and leads to authors and artists worrying more about being \"clever\" than about creative expression itself. The deep cultural resonance provided by a recognized image—a Jedi Knight, a care bear, whatever—can be at least as powerful as whatever intellectual bonus points you get for pure novelty.) Still, I did find your reply kind of funny.","replies":[]}]}]}
