I tested this myself to be sure it was the other janna in the team that resulted in it.\r\nI know it isn&#039;t a game breaking bug, but it is something that ruins the enjoyment of having and using the skin. Please fix Rito.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-15T23:43:57.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya PrincessKairi! \n\nThanks for the report! ^-^ \n\nWe'll take a listen and see what's going on here.","replies":[{"poster":"QueenAqua","date":"2016-03-16T09:59:12.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!
