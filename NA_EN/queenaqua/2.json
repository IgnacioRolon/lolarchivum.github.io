So, Cait and Vi are partners, with a special passive between them and everything. They even both have Officers skins. I love the skins, but in all honesty, i feel like Cait&#039;s is pretty lackluster, but not for the reason most would think. I don&#039;t care about any special effects or anything that Cait&#039;s version doesn&#039;t have. MY particular issue with it is that despite Vi and her being partners, these skins don&#039;t match each other in color scheme or looks except that they are both officers. Cait&#039;s is a lighter blue [in game](http://www.strategyzero.com/images/LoL/SkinModel/OfficerCaitlyn.jpg) and the badge on her hat is different from Vi&#039;s [in game](https://lolskinshop.com/product/officer-vi/). Though the different badges are probably an overlook by Riot, the different colors just don&#039;t work, esp since Riot had Officer Cait and Vi go on [sale](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales/february-bundles-out-now) together with Mafia Jinx for around a week in the February after Officer Vi&#039;s release. If these skins are meant to be together, I would think Riot would make them look like they belong together by making them match in color at the very least like in the picture above done by a Deviantartist (not me) that i found. If a Rioter responds, please tell me if there are any plans to make Cait&#039;s match Vi&#039;s. The color change would be refreshing and I&#039;d enjoy the skin a lot more if it was as dark a blue as Vi&#039;s.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-05-19T16:48:47.737+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hey PrincessKairi,\n\nAt this time, we don't have plans to update Officer Caitlyn. \n\nWhile yes, these skins are meant to be follow a similar thematic, they're not copies of each other. When we work with a particular thematic, we try to make each skin in the line a bit unique. \n\nI think a good skin line to look in this case would be the Blood Moon line. While they're all Blood Moon skins, each of them has something a bit different to them. \n\n> Riot had Officer Cait and Vi go on sale together with Mafia Jinx for around a week in the February after Officer Vi's release.

It's nice and fits the theme of officer a bit better than the lighter blue. Vi and Cait are partners, so it doesn't really make sense to me why they have such different outfits for the same schematic. I get that they shouldn't be the same or anything like that, but they don't really feel similar to me at all. I like officer cait, but I like Vi's better because of the darker blue. Unfortunately, I don't really play Vi so I'm kind stuck with the skin I'm less fond of due to the color scheme. Were there any thoughts on making Vi's a light blue as opposed to the dark blue it has during its concept? Or was it always a plan for Vi's to be the dark blue it has?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-05-19T22:42:09.125+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Looking at these two from purely an artistic stand point - If we'd made Officer Vi's outfit a light blue like Caitlyn, that mixed with her pink hair and white gloves would have washed the skin out. Likewise, if Officer Caitlyn's uniform was darker, it'd blend in with her hair and her weapon. \n\nThe initial Officer Vi concept was a bit lighter, but once the outfit was finalized, the darker blue color scheme was selected.","replies":[{"poster":"QueenAqua","date":"2015-05-19T22:57:00.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's interesting. Always cool to hear the thoughts during a skin's concept. How much lighter was it originally planned? Probably not as light as Cait's. Somewhere in between, closer to dark maybe? I get what you mean about the blending. That nice dark blue would have a problem with blending with Cait's hair. Just kind love that dark blue. Can you see a way of making it so it wouldn't blend? Like maybe if it was a lighter blue than Vi's, but still within the dark blue color spectrum? (Just hashing ideas, not pressuring you into giving me a \"yes definitely. Will make this happen\". I like talking about this with you).","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-05-19T23:35:31.915+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was a couple shades lighter than it currently is, not as light as Cait's uniform, though.\n\nPersonally, I like the contrast how it currently is. I wouldn't want to go much lighter, for the sake of having points of interest, and not having the model as a whole washed out.","replies":[{"poster":"QueenAqua","date":"2015-05-20T03:02:16.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm. That sounds like it was a pretty blue. I like the blue you went with as the end result. It's nice.\n\nI got Officer Caitlyn to match with my hubby's Officer Vi. The contrast is nice if you look at it that way, but I like the blue on Vi's xD. Too bad I just don't play Vi, otherwise I would be fine with the contrast xD (I'm more of an Amu jungle myself). Seriously, you guys made a great color choice for Vi's xD. It's why I want it on Caitlyn's xD. I'm just being a bit silly I guess.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Krigjer","date":"2015-05-19T16:55:53.685+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"Adding on what Katey said, Officer Cait is an older skin. I'm not surprised that the colour palette and other small details aren't consistent. \n\nBesides, what police officer have you ever seen wearing a halter top and mini skirt? I think Cait's making her own fashion statement there.\n\nedit- I'm being downvoted for trying to make a joke here. Ouch these forums are harsh. ","replies":[]}]}
