I mean, Rito changed the fire on Frostfire Annie to have blue ice effects and that's a 520 skin. The fact that a skin that is less expensive than this one has effects means that it wouldn't hurt to add a different color to the fire, maybe with some hearts mixed into the effects, like how Frostfire has snowflakes mixed in. And, since Annie's new skin is basically a miniature, cuter version of Heartseeker Ashe, it stands to reason that pink effects to Annie's fire is prefectly normal and fits into the theme. I love Annie and i want the new skin, but pink fire would make it much more worth it to me considering that Frostfire has effects and is 250 RP cheaper than Valentine's Annie.\n\nEDIT: I do know that NOW Frostfire  is 975 RP, but when i started playing she was 520 RP forever and that's how much she was when i actually got the skin.\n\nP.S. And let's not forget that Sherwood Forest Ashe is 520 RP and she has green tinged arrows, so even if you don't count Annie's Frostfire skin as viable in this argument, there are still skins cheaper than her new 750 RP skin that have effect changes.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-01-16T18:57:51.671+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":5,"body":"Hi there! \n\nAlthough Sweetheart Annie Valentine's Day themed, she's not part of the Heartseeker line.

Like Reverse Annie, Annie in Wonderland, Red Riding Annie, and FrankenTibbers Annie? Sure we'd all love a bit of  price diversity for skins, but if you look at it like this, Annie has 5 skins that are under the 975 tier, only 3 at it, according to the page you linked. I feel that Annie deserves some love regarding her skins because the fact that only panda, frostfire, and goth annie are worth 975, and one of those you can't even buy without at least owning the champions in the bundle, otherwise you'd spend ridiculous amounts of rp for that one skin. Annie has no skin that is 1350RP or higher by the definition on your page. No new animations, no new voice overs. I don't think I'm wrong in saying that if annie doesn't get at least a 1350 RP skin or higher (that actually deserves that spot according to the page) she should at least get another 975 that's actually worth it. And by the page you posted, I don't think I'm wrong in demanding that all the 975 skins Annie has that does not meet the 975 requirement be immediately moved down to where they belong, that way you get the RP price diversity you wanted while also giving people what they want and that is, in this case, pink particles on Sweetheart Annie. \n\nP.S. Will those who bought the 975 skins that should be moved down to the 750RP get refunds when/if the price changes occur?\n\nEdit: TPA Mundo is a 750 skin, yet his cleaver is actually a chalice? Not only that but also has different sound effects when it hits? Why can't Annie have a simple color change in her fire? Is it really that much harder than giving Mundo's cleavers an entirely new texture and sound for his cleavers? I mean no one here is asking for more than pink fire, hearts being included into the effects would be nice, but the only thing we really want is pink fire.","replies":[{"poster":"Masterjlam","date":"2015-01-30T01:21:43.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also, you should noticed that all annie skins (with the exception of Panda Annie) have the same re-call animation!!!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Anonagon","date":"2015-01-17T21:08:00.683+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Changing the colors of particles =/= new particles\n\nI cannot imagine changing the color of her already existing particles to a lighter tint of the same color taking more than an hour of work.\n\nAlso, your own skin guidelines don't match up to the actual prices in game.

As of right now, Annie only has three out of the nine skins she has that actually have effects. Those skins are Goth, Frostfire, and Panda. That's not very many, esp considering how many skins Annie has. And many of the skins that exist are for melee-type champs, where you really CAN'T add any effects. At least the mage Champs should have different effects on a majority of their skins since it is very much possible to be unique with it. And since they are releasing skins with newly released champs that have effects. If you don't believe me, check out the most recently released skins for the last 11 champions (I'm excluding zac due to the simplicity of changing the effects of him since all they needed to do was change the color of zac himself to achieve \"different\" effects) and I'm counting Yas's High Noon one due to the difference in look for his tornado and his other wind abilities, like his shield passive and his wind wall.
