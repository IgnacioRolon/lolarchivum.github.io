So the benefit to a more risky ability is the enemy canâ€™t bush juggle it? \nEven though that is entirely negated by a ward.","replies":[{"poster":"The entire team","date":"2018-11-23T05:21:16.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't forget.

Ezreal ult damages any unfriendly targets it passes through, all the way across the map.\n\nDraven's auto is 550 range and single target. Kayn's W is a 700-range AoE.\n\nGaren Q is melee range, damaging and silencing a single target. Orianna's ult has a range of up to 1125 units, damaging and displacing all targets hit in an AoE.\n\nI think you might be comparing apples to oranges.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dr Dog","date":"2018-11-23T05:16:56.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think its more with cc, point and click hard cc should never be above 1.5 secs period","replies":[]}]}
