Most people know every class has one blatantly op item. \nAdcs have infinity edge\nMages have Rabadons\nBruisers have every item they build\nAssassins have duskblade\nSupport kinda get shafted here. \nTanks are also bent over in this regards. \n\nI have never once said to myself “YES! I finally finished (insert any time item here), now I can have a big impact in the game. Yet every other role has one. \n\nNow. It has to be good at helping them\nSurvive, but also making the enemy team not want to ignore them. But we also don’t want to be giving tanks more damage. \n\nSo. Here is my proposal. \n\nStats and costs are irrelevant. Just throw some health on it and move on. \n\nUnique passive Inspiration - all allies within x units of this character gain a constantly regenerating shield equal to (small %) of this units bonus health. \n\nThis gives teams that team fight around a tank a pretty nice boost to survivability, it stops supports from wanting to rush it due to the hp requirement, and makes the tank an actual threat with the sheer amount of defensive value he’s pumping into the team.","replies":[{"poster":"BrightWîngs","date":"2019-09-20T08:04:59.659+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"imo {{item:3083}} and {{item:3025}} fit this (all though {{item:3025}} is more often abused by carry champs now such as {{champion:81}} {{champion:245}} and {{champion:76}}  ive seen )supports have {{item:3107}} and {{item:3504}} they are really strong items they may not seem that way the work of a tank or support is often unnoticed","replies":[{"poster":"The thigh guy","date":"2019-09-20T08:13:19.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BrightWîngs,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ErKV7yXe,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-09-20T08:04:59.659+0000)\n>\n> imo {{item:3083}} and {{item:3025}} fit this (all though {{item:3025}} is more often abused by carry champs now such as {{champion:81}} {{champion:245}} and {{champion:76}}  ive seen )supports have {{item:3107}} and {{item:3504}} they are really strong items they may not seem that way the work of a tank or support is often unnoticed\n\nWarmogs is trash.

So really you are hurting your team more than anything.","replies":[{"poster":"BrightWîngs","date":"2019-09-21T00:05:10.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didnt say just get raw HP but you are not a tank player you dont play tanks","replies":[{"poster":"The thigh guy","date":"2019-09-21T09:12:55.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BrightWîngs,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ErKV7yXe,comment-id=00010000000000000000,timestamp=2019-09-21T00:05:10.906+0000)\n>\n> I didnt say just get raw HP but you are not a tank player you dont play tanks\n\nI don’t play tanks anymore because they feel like shit to play. \n\nAnd you just argued that warmogs is a good item. It offers ONLY hp. And that’s the problem. You can’t afford to build and item with only hp.\n\nBut you know what. I’ll humor you. \n\nLet’s say you build warmogs third item because the enemy team is a balance of ap and ad so you need armor and magic resistance. \n\nOh look at that. Because they also have to be assumed to have 3 items they all have their %pen items. Because they are all core items. \n\nBut you know what. Let’s go even easier on you. \n\nThe enemy team is all ad. So you can just stack armor right, get that juicy warmogs into ibg you were talking about?\n\n*laughs in conquerer, {{item:3071}} {{item:3035}} * \n\nWelp.

If you have 300 armor and 4.5K HP you might live long enough to do something. \n\nI'm not saying rush warmogs or get is super early I'm saying get it once you got a little bit of resist to make it more valuable. \n\nHaving a ton of armor and low HP is bad HP is what makes that armor valuable just like Attack speed makes AD more valuable on an AD carry. \n\nJust because an item isn't blatantly broken doesn't mean it's not good \n\nYou also do not play tanks I looked at your op.gg in all the seasons you have not once mained tanks you have played a little bit of  enchanters brusiers and juggernauts unless this is not your main account in that case I apologize I'm just going with the information I am able to obtain.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2019-09-20T06:57:54.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the item had values that made it relevant it would make the meta revolve around the characters that abuse it best.

There are initiators which try to pick someone out and survive the enemy team retaliating (Maokai, Malphite, Nunu), the vanguards which try to keep the enemy from doing that (Taric, Braum), and juggernauts, which are more or less fine right now.\n\nInitiators could use a better first item version of Gargoyle stoneplate and Vanguards could use a better Locket or {{item:3025}} .\n\n(Were initiators called vanguards and vanguards something else?
