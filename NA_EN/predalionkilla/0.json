I read from another post that after riot does it's thing everything else is handled from the accounts email, but the problem is the email for the account is locked due to the hackers location setting off a security lock; his email cannot be unlocked it appears. How can we proceed from here to retrieve his account?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-03T21:11:01.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go ahead and have your brother submit a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) on his own. That way we'll be able to work with him one on one. \n\nWe'll be able to work through everything with him there, even if he doesn't have access to the signup email anymore. Remember to have him _stay signed out_ when he writes his ticket!","replies":[]}]}
