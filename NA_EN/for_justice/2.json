She excels when she can trade with her opponents but is balanced because she suffers from typical squishy syndrome. She can be slippery, though; Q reduces enemy vision, and E is a disrupt/knockup, which can interrupt channels, cancel ability animations, and with godly timing, even deny Jhin’s 4th auto attack (personal moment of joy there). Quick gap closers and chain CC, as expected, are your worst nightmare. Any top laners with naturally good sustain are also a challenge, since you rely pretty heavily on regularly proc’ing your passive for damage and have no natural pen or percent damage.\n\nElectrocute vs PtA is mostly preference. I go PtA because I usually build more DPS oriented builds for those pesky ADCs. However, if you feel you need to frontload your damage, Electrocute could work as well.\n\nYour main priority is three-fold: roam and make picks, roam and create map pressure through split pushing, and flank/pick off out of position carries in team fights. You don’t have much presence in the early parts of team fights, so you have to approach them more like assassins than traditional top laners.","replies":[{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2018-03-16T22:15:14.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dokueki Kenshin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fxTOaQk5,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2018-03-16T22:12:22.069+0000)\n>\n\n> Electrocute vs PtA is mostly preference.

If she is, you’re playing her wrong or you’re getting zoned hard, meaning you need to be playing more conservatively.\n\nQuinn is heavily reliant on consistently hitting her Harrier marks. While it’s true that your Q and E do provide Harrier marks on hit, you should be relying heavily on your passive for those marks and using Q and E situationally.\n\nAs an example, I go Q, W, E for lvls 1-3, but I personally max W first. There’s a few reasons for that:\n\n1.) Even without crit, you get your passive frequently enough that you don’t have to rely on manually placing it with Q and E.\n\n2.) You should be itemizing for issues you’re facing in lane. Take Shiv for wave clear if he enemy is pushing hard instead of relying on Q, which *does* gobble up mana. Additionally, Essence Reaver is a personal favorite of mine on her when going full crit, since it cures her mana problems more or less.\n\n3.) Maxing W gives you substantial short term increases in movement and attack speed. This increases your DPS and kiting potential against certain champions.","replies":[{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2018-03-17T15:56:17.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive been maxing q-e-w but ill try that instead","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"lolibus","date":"2018-03-16T23:33:54.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"shes not very fun botlane, you will get smashed into bits","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2018-03-16T22:03:37.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because she's not really good enough to be an ADC and top she's mainly annoying because of her range.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BobaFlautist","date":"2018-03-16T21:57:20.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because she has a fragile play pattern.\n\nMost of the power in her kit is pretty dependant on being allowed to do her thing. Same reason Lee Sin falls off despite high ad ratios, against proper play she doesn't get to use her numbers.\n\nIf you're going to play her, I would recommend going top and going lethality against squishies/while winning hard and crit against tanks. \n\nIf you haven't killed your lane opponent by level 6, you probably shouldn't bother returning to lane-just roam and bully the weakest member of the opposing team with repeated ganks.\n\nI would imagine electrocute is the right choice, and I think you're most likely to carry against a team of squishies (no tanks) with limited/skillshot cc and/or burst. Bonus points if they're uncoordinated and/or constantly pick fights ","replies":[]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-03-16T21:53:27.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with Quinn is that she doesn't deliver on her thematic anymore. And on top of that she's balanced for being somewhere between a marksman and an assassin.\n\nShe only works as an assassin when she's ridiculously fed, so you have to snowball to make that work. Plus you get more consistent damage output and more passive procs if you build crit so I recommend that over lethality.\n\nShe doesn't work very well in the bot lane, everyone out-ranges her, so it's better to go top lane unless you are running a kill-lane bot. But going top with a ranged character like that is quite a dick move, since you'll be harassing someone with your superior range. That said she's still squishy AF so if you get ganked or if the other laner turns on you and manages to catch you then you're going to have a bad time.\n\nShe's good with a pick team-comp. You can use your ultimate to split push and force the enemy team to separate and then pick off key targets so that your team can group and press their numbers advantage.\n\nIf you want to play her bottom lane I recommend doing it with a kill-lane support, like Blitzcrank or Leona, although she has some good synergy with Taric and Nami as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"whyusmurfinb","date":"2018-03-16T21:53:03.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"running around at 700+ movespeed killing squishies sounds fun asf\"  thats your answer she is more of an assassin  to snowball games","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fresh Untilted","date":"2018-03-16T21:48:32.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She works in solo queue, but there are better alternatives.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-16T21:44:48.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quinn is too mp-reliant and short-ranged to be a threat in botlane, so her niche is harassing low-mobility top laners until they outscale her, ignore her existence, and win anyway.","replies":[]}]}
