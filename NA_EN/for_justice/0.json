I KNOW this is a server side issue, because I can still:\n\n1)play dota, call of duty, and skyrim ESO just fine\n2) ONLY happens whne I play tristana\n3) have constant full bars with browser intact, no downloads, no discord.\n\nthis is VERY VERY frustrating for me, so I need some help, especially because its not my fault.\nplus, no matter how many times I restart phone, restart computer, or restart hotspot, it continues to happen. and it bothers me that my opponents are always saying GGEZ for something that I cant control\n\nedit:\nalso moving dosent help either, it happens no matter where I am","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-18T16:40:16.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Though your internet is fine you can still have problems communicating or reaching specific servers.  If your network to the game server is unstable, the issue can happen at any point so it only happening on Tristana is a likely coincidence.  There are no issues with the servers currently, and I haven't heard of anything that would cause a specific champion to disconnect a player.  Our [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) can also help give a better overview of your specific case.\n\nI highly recommend sticking to custom games for now and going over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help tune things up.","replies":[{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2017-10-18T16:43:09.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok ill try that i guess, but just to further confirm its tristana, i wont pick her for my next couple of games.

When you play Tristana, do you completely disconnect or does it feel more like frame skips?  The only thing that could cause a kind of stuttering would be if your game files for Tristana are failing to render properly.  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2017-10-18T17:38:13.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its not a complete disconnect, because the reconnecting bar dosent pop up, its more just super annoying and long stutters","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
