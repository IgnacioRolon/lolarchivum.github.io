Greed did get thebest of me and i would run in a bit more to get that 2nd bomb off only to be crippled by nasus and be given broken crutches. \r\nP.S. Azir can launch a 130lb sand man at me with farther range than i can throw a 30lb bomb?? Ugh even ziggs throws farther. And that dude is tiny. Could you imagine a human sitting down and throwing a basketball that far?","replies":[{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-02-27T05:51:47.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly I just played him for the first time since the change, lets make his ONE damaging abiility unreliable. The projectile needs to be sped up. I had times where I would throw it behind the enemy and they could walk out of it still by retreating.","replies":[]}]}
