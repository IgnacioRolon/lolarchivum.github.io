I&#039;m now allowed to flame and harass and report meta-breakers and autolockers because they will never be as significant an impact as me, someone who plays the correct champion in the correct role and calls it in the match screen. It doesn&#039;t even matter if I go 0/8/5 and you go 3/7/13, you clearly don&#039;t grasp the pressure I add to the map with my plays. You better know I will probably die FB watching you, to see if you die, and talk shit, when you die to a gank, that I gave FB to.&quot;\r\n\r\nI literally stopped and pointed out-\r\n&quot;You know what? Teemo is the only one not talking shit- and he&#039;s not even a real JG. You think you can bm someone who doesn&#039;t follow matchscreen-ranked-rules at all times? This is blindmatch wtf. You act like because you &#039;filled a role&#039; this Teemo JG isn&#039;t the only fucking reason we have a chance of winning and you won&#039;t STFU and not die WHILE TYPING. honor teemo. afk.&quot; \r\n\r\nI know afk is bad, but trust me, I dodged a bullet, his next question was &quot;what does bm mean?&quot; I also got (5)lowQ v.v they were also a premade 3. \r\n\r\nBut in reality, I&#039;m just tired of picking a champion that can play a couple roles,\r\nbut everyone HUFF and SIGH when they see a champion, and &#039;be the justice warrior&#039; and switch champions- so tired of it...they never ask, they never consider, and in their opinion 1 champ-per-role.\r\n\r\nThe same people are hypocrites too. Coin and sighstone are both good on Katarina IMO being the build I pick for her to support.\r\n\r\nIf I type &#039;sup&#039; and pick katarina first though, these same people, just go &#039;oh she&#039;s obviously retarded, pooor thing&#039; and they then proceed to pick a support. Then feed like shit. Thanks for autolocking JANNA when I CALLED SUP. That definitely doesn&#039;t make you worse than me. You&#039;re not even a support main you say? First time Janna? Well you sure saved us, even though I have played kat support over 200 times.\r\n\r\nNot saying I&#039;m QQing over not getting Kat support, just saying, you act like the role call matters a fucking lot INGAME, but during the MATCHSCREEN in certain circumstances, you even completely fucking ignore your own ideas.\r\n\r\nEither be an asshole that lets people pick what they want, but enforce the role calls\r\nOr be an asshole that trys to &#039;fill/carry&#039; the composition of the team, despite the role calll; dealing with both is too much.\r\n\r\nor genius idea: Don&#039;t be an asshole.","replies":[]}
