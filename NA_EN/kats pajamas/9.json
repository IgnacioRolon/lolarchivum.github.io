Not only is it underwhelming, but it offers him limitless mana, restoring 50 more then it costs to use pick a card. Ultimately making CDR a method of mana capping, creating more crowd control and more poke.\r\n\r\nThis is also the worst TF build there is. In every other build, the blue card is to be skipped out of hate.\r\n\r\nAs someone who doesn't play TF, I'll tell you what I hate. His limitless mana and non-random mechanic of pick a card.\r\n\r\n I believe 2 gold cards should be able to be cycled in a row. I believe it shouldn't always start on blue, wtf, it's the worst card, it should be random, not 'charging in order of powerfulness'. I believe that some cycles, out of randomness should possibly not even contain all 3  colors. It's PICK A CARD(You people know what that is right....)\r\n\r\nLastly, his blue should not restore mana, the red card should have the blue cards damage, the red slow should last 3s. and the blue card should give this:\r\n\r\nTF's next basic attack is 150% slower, the duration of the time from when the auto-attack is traveling, until it his the target, TF gains \"Duck\" passive.\r\n\r\nDuck: No specific duration, consumed when it his target, 80% dodge from auto-attacks, 35% dodge of spells(includes CC). This attack will knockup the target for 1s.\r\n\r\nThere, now all 3 of his cards has cc and it makes sense, and I'll be looking forward to nuking you oom TF's soon.","replies":[]}
