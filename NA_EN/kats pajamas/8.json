The best part of this argument, is that the 'faith in god' argument takes literally 0 energy, while 'trying to observe evolution' takes a lot of time and energy.\n\nConclusion: Religious people aren't mostly stupid, they're just stupid, and mostly lazy.\n\nThis is why I hate having religious conversations with certain Christians, because you're not arguing philosophy, you're arguing if they're lazy or not enough to read an article or improve themselves with more knowledge, and fighting a brickwall of denial and douchebaggery responses.\n\nThis is normally followed with them linking you some kind of sermon video or passage. God damn it Christians, why? Half the shit you post, you're missing the main point: **WHY?** What does this specific piece of evidence show, and can you word it in a couple sentences without copypastaing the whole fucking bible as proof of **YOUR point**? Like **YOUR point** is even gracious enough to use the bible as a reference half the time in the first place. Pfffffffffffft. \n\nThe pure hate you spread in your messages is disgusting, and to think you can start conversations over hate and discrimination, of: Gays/Woman/Any other religion/race/other organizations, then turn around be claim to be a holy message of peace, and goodness, has levels of evil in it, I was sure was reserved for the devil himself.\n\nYou're a warmongering group of people that are crazy, and have caused religious bloodshed every single generation for hundreds of years, because the implication of science in humanity has tainted your church, while making lives for EVERYONE ELSE, GENERALLY A LOT FUCKING BETTER.\n\nIf you're so fucking religious, I want my TV back. Go read your stupid fucking book.","replies":[]}
