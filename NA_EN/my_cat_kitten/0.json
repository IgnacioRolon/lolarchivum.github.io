Your best bet is to bookmark that site should any issues arise, and plan your next matches accordingly.  To be safe, I don't suggest hopping into a ranked while an issue is being investigated just to be safe.  \n\nIn regards to the title of your post, it's truthfully not something I have visibility towards.  It's a crappy case for players who were impacted with a loss due to the server problems, but literally have no means to adjust game stats.  I can definitely relay your feedback and sentiments, but these things aren't my call to make.  Should anything come up, though, I'll do my best to offer an update.","replies":[]}]}
