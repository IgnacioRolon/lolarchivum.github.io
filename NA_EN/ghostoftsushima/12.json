As the support role doesn't say \"Support Bot Lane\" so due to riots logic I should be able to support from Top, Mid, Jungle, or Bot. However playing with friends will be much less of a headache.\n\nI do agree that with the removal of exp Quints and Zilean old passive exp is extremely difficult to get with the double jungle strategy unless you get a kill and then shove lane to reset lane this way your \"taxing\" by sharing exp/gold with laner.\n\nI also agree moving the position of Ranged ADC(if you feel the need to still have one) to top/mid while placing a tank/mage with good clear bot would help.\n\nIn the video linked below you can see that even with randoms Double Jungle can still be an effective strategy.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/n4-jZylsbRE","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2018-01-21T11:15:26.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm? Back then Junglers didn't even exist dude, wasn't even a role. Besides ganking isn't only limited to just junglers... midlaners, supports, and toplaners can gank as well, oh adcs? They probably just busing farming, but if they do gank they will push hard for 1st turret instead of farming.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nosnide","date":"2018-01-21T08:08:30.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would be interesting and fun.
