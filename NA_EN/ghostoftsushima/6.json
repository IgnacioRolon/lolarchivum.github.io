I mean seriously half the time when you have someone on your team who is melee vs a range, they fed like shit non-stop. I did my best to carry this heavy ass scrub on my team and they talk shit?! YOU&quot;RE GETTING FUCKING CARRY, YOU HAVE NO ROOM TO TALK  \r\n\r\nSeriously tho, when you&#039;re getting carry (JUST STFU)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nBut back to my TOPIC\r\n\r\n&quot;You&#039;re playing an easy Champ&quot;\r\n\r\nSo I play Renekton, sure he a easy Champ to use, but is the fucking match up easy? No it ain&#039;t when you&#039;re playing against a damn range.\r\nSo this guy act like he can do as good as I did just because he think its easy. LMAO \r\n\r\n_**Typical noobs who think they can do the same thing watching LCS **_\r\n\r\nIf every damn Champ or Match-Up is easy, why couldn&#039;t you win your lane (I told him that)? He couldn&#039;t say shit because he was feeding so damn hard. No that was a joke he did talk shit like a babyrage mofo he is. That what bronze are anyway, they can&#039;t shut up and think they do well even when they are not.\r\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n_**YEAH THIS EXPLAIN THE SPAM ON THE LEAGUE BOARD OF BRONZE COMING HERE CRYING WHY THEY&#039;RE PLACE BRONZE AGAIN WHEN THEY ARE BRONZE OR LOW SILVER LAST SEASON**_","replies":[]}
