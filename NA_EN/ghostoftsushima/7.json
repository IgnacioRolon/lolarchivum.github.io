I know this pain, and usually when people are total jerks when Im jungle or support, I just send in all chat some stupid line like \"I feel I should tell the toxic ass (insert lane here) about this ancient RPG proverb, don't piss off support, or risk death by lost of ganks\"  then if he doesn't realize hes being an ass after that, I just mute him and forget his lane exists \n\ndosn't help that my main junglers are team reliant, and my main supports are sorta broke atm","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dorans Pants","date":"2017-12-17T16:59:34.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah it´s even worse than supports. as a support you have take abuse from one guy (the boosted adc), but as a jgl it´s your entire team. Everyone expects you to win their lanes no matter the circumstances, basically ganking non stop, while not falling behind in exp and cs. You are also supposed to get all objectives even though your team has lost complete control over the map. \n\nthere is only so much a jgl can do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Janakin","date":"2017-12-17T13:57:25.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or when you step in the bush to counter gank and they start spamming pings on you, even though you place control ward in there, so you know the enemy didnt see you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WubbaLubbaDubDab","date":"2017-12-17T13:45:40.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as a jg main what makes me MAD is when someone(mostly yasuo players)push like hell keep dying when i tell them to def and then blame me for 0 ganks","replies":[]}]}
