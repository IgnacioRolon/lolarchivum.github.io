Preventing the real MVP to earn Honor.\r\n-------------\r\nI&#039;m pretty sure theres alot of us who carry the shit out of our game but receive &quot;ZERO&quot; honor cus of how it work.\r\n-------------\r\nHonestly I don&#039;t give a crap about the &quot;HONOR SYSTEM&quot; but &quot;CLASH MODE&quot; requiring &quot;HONOR 3+&quot; to participate is stupid. \r\nI just kinda want the reward they have to offer in it basically LMAO \r\n\r\nI say that as long as you&#039;re not &quot;Dishonorable&quot; you should just be able to play in the &quot;CLASH MODE&quot;\r\n--------------\r\nIs like Riot is trying to force every single players to play Duo to get self-honor and trying to force players to play Support cus no one like that role, its shitty and the most non-impact in the game if your carry is bad","replies":[]}
