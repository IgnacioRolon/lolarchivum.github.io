If Aphro messes up that ult C9 probably wins the game right then and there, but he nailed it and showed why Bard has OP potential in the right hands.\n\nThey pushed the issue btw because they had a team fight comp, they knew Jax would TP in and wanted him to - they wanted him to stop split pushing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GLV Beamer","date":"2016-02-29T15:02:26.993+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"he just made a bad call and picked a fight that he thought they could win but they lost it.

Before the tower dive even started, he landed a stun on Sneaky right outside of turret range. If Sneaky had gotten in an extra auto attack or two on the tower before the dive started, I don't think bard ult saves the turret and Darshan's TP doesn't come in. Then after the fight started, he managed to bait Sneaky into attacking him for a second or two, and not attacking darshan to save Jensen.\n\nI think C9 made the right call. Aphro's bard, and Sneaky/Jensen being just a tad too far forward is why C9 lost that fight in my opinion.\n\nAmazing game, awesome fight. I'm still salty C9 lost :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"xJLx MCHammer","date":"2016-03-01T01:59:59.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was an OK call but the Bard ult landed in a way that made an ok call into a really bad one.

I respect teams who go for the win, instead of grinding it out for another 10 minutes. C9 went for the win. If Aphro's bard ult wasn't perfect, they probably won right there. Hell, if Xmithie didnt get caught in it, they prob. still won. Him surviving was the biggest issue. If he was still outside it, they would have burst him down, and it probably won the 4v4 after Zion Tp'd. Instead, they tunneled on Xmithie, he still lived, and then it was a 5v4.\n\nYes, they culd have just took the turret, and then the inhib, and probably won the game later. but they went for the win then. I dont think it was the worst call. Xmithie was pretty much dead. He was caught, dead, and it was prob. over. Just that perfect bard ult. Hell,","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2016-02-29T19:23:38.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sneaky positioned too aggressively after the bard ult went down. Basically he dashes out of the bard ult and then walks back to where the bard ult would have put him if it hit him anyway.\n\nHe gets hit by Jax stun because he ran up to melee range udyr thinking they could burst him down and then uses his dash to jump onto Huhi (who flashes away) when he could have just stayed back and focused down the Jax then Corki. He even starts hitting the bard for a little bit ??? literally the lowest priority target.\n\nWorth noting that he could have just shredded the Jax as he already used his dodge ability and had almost no armor AND was focused on the leblanc who would have survived to burst down the back line if he would have focused Jax.\n\nIt is weird to single out one player but their teamfight was built around him in this comp so he really has to position well and prioritize targets correctly for it to work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Guyy Fieri","date":"2016-02-29T16:19:36.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They had just chunked out Xmithie.
