They don&#039;t need wards to know where you are (Full map awareness)\r\n2. They group alot (And actually shit on actual boosted scrub who can&#039;t handle bot in a 4v2 fight LOL)\r\n3. They know how to press R\r\n4. They play better than Plat players for a BOT\r\n5. They don&#039;t argue with you if you feed\r\n6. They don&#039;t play greedy, if they are one shot they go back to base unlike real scrub \r\n7. The list go on \r\n-------------\r\nLike holy fuck these new BOT, they are INTELLIGENCE\r\n\r\nPeople who don&#039;t like ranked and try to avoid ranked? Guess what you better start avoiding Normals as well cus these BOT are way more smarter and dangerous than actual brain dead players \r\n\r\nIf you can&#039;t even handle these new BOT? Don&#039;t ranked\r\n\r\nThese new BOT are still relatively easy, but just number 4 on my list is why \r\n-------------\r\nBasically if you&#039;re Bronze/Silver and you can&#039;t even win your Ranked game. Sad asf because when these new BOT are officially out, you won&#039;t be able to Ranked or Norms but do actual BOT game of COOP vs AI on Beginners level  so you can actually win games\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not even making fun of Bronze/Silver players because if people at this actual elo actually play with Bronze/Silver level and they can&#039;t win, playing with these new BOT in norms or whatever they might be implant it to, you won&#039;t even beat them\r\n\r\nBecause number 4 on my LIST again _**&lt;-------------------------------------**_","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-04-01T10:01:01.377+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cant tell is sarcasm because of effort in thread","replies":[]},{"poster":"a big msitake","date":"2017-04-01T09:57:30.386+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"T-They aren't actually bots.\n\nThat's the joke.","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-04-01T10:04:28.986+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gonna be a long day.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GhostOfTsushima","date":"2017-04-01T10:36:13.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^^^^\n\nThats the point","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2017-04-01T10:04:41.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are real players","replies":[]},{"poster":"SirΤeemο","date":"2017-04-01T10:40:25.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"where i find those bots? \ni played some games and i didnt found any\n------------\nby the way.. those bots are the answer to autofill , they can play support ","replies":[]}]}
