Just because you aren't a member of the largest tier in the game doesn't mean jack. Nobody deserves anything, and boosting might not be a problem if season rewards didn't involve skins that once they are doled out, can never be received. It's a slap in the face to over 50% of ranked players who tried their damnedest. You worked hard to get at least Gold tier? Bravo, you don't deserve anything more than a pat on the back; you aren't entitled to anything and the fact Riot gives people extremely limited skins encourages boosting.","replies":[{"poster":"Ximlee","date":"2015-02-11T12:59:18.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those skins are for people that've worked their asses off and have  dedicated time to getting better at this game.

You think silver is harder to climb out of when clearly, if it's so hard to get out of silver then more skilled opponents will be in gold to prevent you from climbing. And how would you know how difficult it is if you've never been in gold? Next, why are you complaining about how big the division is? Would you prefer longer queue times?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Derpy Mike","date":"2015-02-10T20:17:44.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How much does a boost to gold go for nowadays?
