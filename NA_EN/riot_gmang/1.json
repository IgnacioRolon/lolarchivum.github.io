We&#039;ve read a lot and are using it to inform the design. Some of the concerns we want to address right away:\r\n\r\n* &quot;Plant spawns (especially Blast Cones) feel too random and can&#039;t be planned around.&quot;\r\n* &quot;Plants are adding too much clutter.&quot;\r\n\r\nSo, based on recent feedback (especially PBE and some internal feedback), we&#039;ve done a significant iteration on the plant spawn system:\r\n\r\n* **The locations where Blast Cones can spawn are no longer randomized, and fewer will spawn**\r\n * The &quot;game start&quot; Blast Cones now represent the only possible spawn locations\r\n * Removed most Blast Cone spawn locations; total per quadrant: 5-6 -&gt; 2\r\n * Max Blast Cones alive at any given time per quadrant: 3 -&gt; 2\r\n * Respawn time now begins on corpse cleanup instead of &quot;Ready&quot; state\r\n* **Respawn times increased across the board**\r\n* **Seedling growth time increased: 30 seconds -&gt; 60 seconds**\r\n * (This is the stage of a plant life cycle where it&#039;s scoutable but not usable yet.)\r\n* **Made other small adjustments to plant positions**\r\n * Nudged some Honeyfruit spawns so they aren&#039;t &quot;inside walls&quot; or obscured by terrain as much\r\n * Moved the Scryer&#039;s Bloom spawn location between Blue Buff and mid lane a little away from mid (towards river)\r\n\r\nThese were submitted to the PBE code on 10/24 (should appear on the 10/25 build), so the details of the [old system explanation](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/zVy7EKcI-plant-spawn-full-system-design-pbe) will be a bit outdated.\r\n\r\nTry the changes out on PBE and let us know what you think!","replies":[{"poster":"Over Innsmouth","date":"2016-10-25T20:30:09.438+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm glad to see that you guys are responding to community feedback, it really means a lot!\n\nHowever, should there be a continuous negative response, are you still open to the idea of removing Plants altogether?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot GMang","date":"2016-10-25T21:20:00.465+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Nothing's off the table, though I don't think we'd rush to that. First impressions can get messy, especially if you have communication issues (which we've had on Plants imo). Last midseason, for example, randomized dragons and red/blue camp respawn indicators drew massive criticism before ship. While some people still don't like them, I think it's fair to say they at least didn't turn out as bad as pre-release threads indicated.\n\nA personal tangent from my experience: As games evolve, \"obvious wins\" become rarer, and the philosophy of \"the riskiest thing is to not take risks\" starts emerging (you see this in other long-evolving games like MTG). Plants are a new design space in many ways, and it's possible they won't work out. But after playtesting them in various forms over the past several months, we think there's something valuable there.","replies":[{"poster":"gyyyr","date":"2016-10-26T17:46:27.905+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the the addition of Plants but there is one thing that differenciates Dragon RNG from this plants RNG.\n\nEven if you lose a teamfight just because of the dragon buffs, no one will blame the dragon buffs for the loss of the teamfight(even if it would be correct in this situation). The players will say their positioning was bad or they didn't have a good enough team synergy or whatever but it will never be the dragons fault(except for elder, but elder isn't RNG. elder is guaranteed to be the next dragon when there is no dragon at the moment and the clock is at 35 minutes or more).\nIf someone survives because of a plant, the players will blame the plant for making them loose the teamfight. \nThe plants **feel** much more impactful than the dragons, even if they may not be more impactful.\n\nBoth are visible long before they are useable so both teams can contest them and can use them strategically, but it's still not exactly the same.\n\nBtw.

Plants in and of themselves do not warrant the backlash they have received. I'm fairly neutral on plants themselves. It's what they they forced out of the game that warrants the backlash (smite buffs).\n\nHere are my concerns from what I consider myself to be a pretty level headed jungler:\n\n1. Of the three plants, blast cone seems to be the most dynamic \"risk\" or choice that is being implemented. But it is basically a free flash in the middle of the jungle. Could be used to engage/steal Dragon or Baron. Could be used to engage/escape. I don't see much more potential than that and I see more frustration that satisfaction coming from an RNG free flash that changes the tide of the entire game.\n\n2. Honeyfruit's heal is free hp. Nothing dynamic about it other than the slow. When players walk by it they will take it 99% of the time unless they are being engaged/chasing. Even then... frustration from RNG free heal in a duel or someone at the losing end of a trade stays in lane indefinitely. Of the three plants, this is by far the most pointless. In jungle's current state I feel it is unnecessary since smite heal is allowing most junglers to go through jg healthier as it is. \n\n3. Scrying Orb is interesting giving true vision in a massive cone. But it doesn't excite me or feel additive. This will be a compelling tool in late game contesting objectives but i find it a poor vision tool for much else due to its RNG and short active time. I also don't like the pollen broadcasting your location to the enemy team. Feels like its a win-lose to use it most of the time. \"I know where you are. But you know exactly where I am.\" Not very compelling.\n\n4. Finally my biggest concern (if you've made it this far) is not the plants themselves, but what they forced out of the game; smite buffs. As a jungler main, smite buffs represent some of the most compelling choices/tools for the role of JUNGLER. The single faceted \"smite heals\" now is not very compelling to me and dumbs down the jungle... especially withe in spawn timer going from 100-150.\n\nAt the end of the day people will get used to them and play around them. It will not lead to the death of League as we know it, but I feel it is change for the sake of change... and this case, that is not a good thing.\n\nAnyway - three people will probably read this so I'll wrap up.

So should i rescue it or not?).\nIt is only available for the team that is behind, giving them a possible \"comeback\" option, and not only a \"better snowballing\" for a team that is ahead.\n\n___\n# Changed Plants, with \"Grow Up\" Mechanic\n\n**HealPlant**:\n\n- slows while eating the fruits\n\n- \"**Jung**\":\n           \n          - less healing(~66% - 75% of current version)\n          - a debuff, lasting ~10seconds.\n          - debuff could be: \"_Dmg vs Champs reduced by X%_\"(5-10% ish) /\"_Healing Reduction_\"(like the summoner Heal, does not affect the heal from the plant + duration depends on the amount of fruits eaten)\n \n- \"**Mature**\":\n            \n             - full healing (100% - 120%/125% of current version)\n             - no debuff( but still slowed while eating the fruits)\n             - (cause the fruits are now fully \"ready\" to eat)\n \n___\n\n**VisionPlant**:\n\n- if an enemy Control Ward or {{item:3364}}  is used/in range, the duration of reaveal will be halfed\n- if \"raptor buff\" or {{item:3341}}  is used, the reveal will be completly removed in the area of effect, OR to 3 sec reduced\n\n- \"**Jung**\":\n               \n              - no Stealth Ward reveal!\n              - maybe lowered range/duration\n\n- \"**Mature**\": \n     \n              - like the current version\n\n___\n\n**BombPlant**:\n\n - If used by a ranged champ it has a 0.5s delay before exploding!\n\n- \"**Jung**\":\n  \n             - does dmg to the user (only a flat amount of dmg)\n             - smaller knockback\n             - only the user gets knocked away, does not effect others in range!

All they add is BS randomness and take away Smite buffs.  \n> \n> ~David,\n> Jungler Main\n\n\nWhat David has to say here is absolutely true. \n\nIn a game with a huge e-sports scene that is promoted every year in more and more regions of our planet, things need to be cool. Not just for the audience, though, also for the people who aren't in the audience, and just hear about it later. Turkey's e-sports scene is the perfect example. Even after seeing SuperMassive go 1-9 in the 2016 mid-season invitational, LoLesports wrote [an article](http://www.lolesports.com/en_US/articles/how-turkeys-supermassive-won-our-hearts) on how they 'won our hearts.' There is more and more hype about the wildcard regions each year. Bangkok Titans were huge in 2015, SuperMassive were also at worlds but as Beşiktaş e-Sports Club (they changed names after a re-branding in January this year). There is a [whole branch](http://www.riotgames.com/articles/20160120/255/riot-games-istanbul) of Riot positioned in Istanbul, and they seem to be doing their jobs just fine. The primary focus is on creating new content and diversifying the game to a point where publicity is higher because the e-sports is super cool, with all of this new content, do you (Riot Games) intend to open up to more regions and remove the Wildcard Tournament? \n\nIf publicity through cool and lucky gameplay is what you want in return from the plant and jungle revisions, do you intend on bringing more than just SKT, RNG_(not that kind you silly goose)_, TSM, and other big name brands to the table when it comes to tournaments? Or will you just ignore the growing regions and make them fight for their chance to play on the big-stage?\nRussia's Albus Nox Luna came pretty far this year for a wildcard team while **only 3-2ing** their knockout stage opponent.\n\nBy adding these flare elements, if you will, and removing the aspect of an intellectually competent strategy with which to define play-style, all junglers will end up taking the same 'standard' jungle paths and the game will become boring. Except for when the RNG comes into play and a game changing variable has been introduced, like the enemy sneaking baron. Information that could be prevented is no longer concealable, taking a whole layer of strategy away from the game. Will the game add more visual pizzazz? Of course. Will it make audiences 'ooh' and 'aah'? Of course. Will it make the pro players and the top tiered players actually have to adapt and learn new types of strategy to bring to the fight next season? Of course... **not**.\n\nLet's talk about smite.\n\nThe strategy behind smite buffs and the synergies with different champions and their roles allowed smite to develop into more than just a tool for securing objectives and combating champions. Items already gave smite more aspects of play-style(blue/red), so why not keep that empowering feeling of being the sole controller of smite on your team, the decider of what to prioritize, damage(gromp), objectives and clears(krugs), vision(wolves/raptors), or just basic vitals(mana and hp from blue/red). \n\nBy removing the smite buffs and adding plants, you are essentially breaking the game down to season 4, and adding RNG plants to the mix. Why won't the pro junglers just find the best jungle paths and stick to them? That's what they did in season 4 and before. This season, we just saw in the knockouts that junglers had different options, and that counter play to paths is a viable and noticeable part of the game(example [Faker](https://youtu.be/ZZj3q6IHoes?t=12m30s) in game 4 versus Rox Tigers).\n\nBy removing strategic appeal and adding visual appeal, I predict that the e-sports scene will dissolve into nothing but a milky version of it's current state. Bjergsen - a top tier mid laner in NA - is  _cheating_ by having Aurelion Sol 4th banned from his games because pros haven't figured out a 100% counter him. He has done it twice now, reminiscent of how the WWE sets up matches and makes rookies win because they want a new face to represent their 'game'. \n\nThis is what Riot has come to? Wanting a new face (the jungle) to call in more attention from 'oohs' and 'aahs' as pro players depressingly shift around the jungle using exploding plants in order to procure the most cash to win by stats? To have secretive baron fights exposed because some jungler clicked on a plant? Let the community and the pros keep the srategy, keep the next level thinking and mechanics. Let the bronze players **work** and **learn** to advance, not get lucky with some plants and follow set patterns developed by the pros. \n\nI don't want to see that. I refuse to see a shadowed version of my favorite game be put on the Jumbo-Tron at times square (next seasons venue {{champion:6}}).\n\nInstead of introducing new random things and taking away old strategic things, why don't you give the jungle  rework fit for a dragon? Randomly placing the smaller camps. The buffs are still there, the smite diversity is still available. The vision and counter-play are still not completely reliant on area of effect RNG. Instead, the buffs are spread out and there is not one distinct path that junglers take. The pros are forced to adapt and react to every game, while the players can't directly copy them(a disaster after support {{champion:21}}). It offers a new kind of game in the jungle, while also retaining the same aspects that strategy has evolved out of around the dragon. It forces new shifts and patterns around the jungle(as the dragon forces fights over important buffs), it creates diversity, while retaining the control and strategy of professional League today. \n\nThese are my two {{item:3301}} \n\nThank you for reading, if you made it all the way through. It has been a pleasure writing, and I hope to get some kind of Riot feedback.\n\nBest wishes,\nGriffin 'iBlitzcrank' Meeks\n\n\n\n\n(P.S.

They all sounds pretty good and seem to be in the direction of what people wanted, but I'm not a PBE player so I'm not sure how it was before or how it will be now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Banoffee","date":"2016-12-03T00:44:51.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where does the feedback come from? Also just because a player likes plants doesn't mean they dislike the smite buffs. Actually, want to make everyone happy? Add both. There's no reason not to.\n\nThe jungle feels less rewarding and interactive.\n\nBefore, it had depth. Raptors were a go-to. Clear early wards after first clear. Gank after B. If the enemy jungler was a bully, pick up wolf ward. If I needed to kite early because the lanes looked to scary to gank early I'd pick up krugs. If I picked Sej, gromp was a good starter. If I was counter-jungling I could feel confident doing it with raptor buff and get out if I was seen. This was really useful with Kindred and Shyvana.\n\nNow the jungle is boring and uninteresting. There's no strategic engagement. There's no thought. What's the point in jungling now? It doesn't feel like I'm jungling. I'm just laning in the woodline. I say this as someone who started playing in season 3. Jungling back then was boring too. Things got a bit interesting when double jungle was a thing. Rek'Sai got released and she made the jungle interesting. Then we get the jungle buffs -the holy grail of jungle satisfaction. We were holding down our side of the map. We secured resources. We had control of an entire half of the field -or all of it if you were good. It was something you could feel protective of and shout on allchat \"gtfo MY jungle!\" \"My jungle now.\" \"Try again bby.\" \"My jungle.\"\n\nYou were the curator of everything your side of the river. And as a jungler, that's what made it awesome whether we utilized it to max effect or not. Denying us that because not everyone does maximize its potential is fucked up.\n\nI don't like the role of jungling anymore. I like my champions still, but I can't take Kindred into lane. I can't take Shyvana top reliably. I can't take Sejuani into lane. My only other jungler is Diana.\n\nThe plants don't offer engaging gameplay of any kind. I've only found them useful as support bot when a low-hanging honeyfruit is there for sustain. I typically blow up blast cones and sight plants so they can't be used against me in a situation I can't control. Even then, using the sight plant in your own jungle signals your location. There's no strategic use for that unless you're using on the fly to invade and escape. Wait, I have a plant in my jungle that's most reliable used against me? Blast cones? What if I'm using Kindred who can't 1v1 and they have a Shaco or Vi? I get bulldozed and they escape if I manage to outplay them with the plants in my jungle? You can't always control the positioning. You can't control your jungle. Controlling the jungle is what makes jungling gratifying. My jungle should be void of creatures. I should be decked in buffs. And the map should be lit like Madison Square Garden. I don't feel any sense of satisfaction with these uninteractive, unreliable, and boring plants.\n\nPlease hear this Riot. The jungle is our sanctuary. You had it right. No one bitched about the buff jungle. We love it. Keep it. Stop trying to change what already works and is loved by the junglers in the community. Why is it fair to ask a mid-laner or a top-laner or a bot-laner if they like the new jungle? They're not junglers. Do you ask a motorcyclist whether he like the concept design for the BMW M1? No. You ask the car enthusiast. He's the one that matters. Laners don't care about the jungle as long they're fed and get buffs and objectives. It's our job to handle that and you've stripped all the enjoyment in doing it from the game. Buff jungle wasn't broken. Stop trying to fix it. We love it. And just because some people like plants does not mean they dislike the buff jungle.\n\nYou said you would consider bringing the buff jungle back. I hope that's still on the table.\n\nAs a player who's been here since S3 I've been a part of many other gaming communities as well. By far, this community is filled with the most discontent in company decision-making that I've seen. Discontent, I know this isn't lost on you guys. I still remember all the nerfs and reworks and these boards lit up like a riot fire. The Sona rework holds particular significance in my mind. Even calm posters turned toxic with that fiasco. Here though, you had something you're praised for. You had a jungle we love. You had a jungle that's interesting and engaging. Go back to the buff jungle. It's untrue that if you like plants you don't like buff jungle and you're about to essentially go back on a groundbreaking LoL innovation and take us back to the dark ages. The choices we made defined us as junglers. If Lee Sin wanted to save his red smite to bully me as Kindred. He was well within his rights to take the risk. He could've used it elsewhere. He didn't. He manages to kill me and it pays off. I decide to keep my smite as Sejuani and bring down the red buff for extra health. I could save it for the laner I'm about to gank or in case the enemy Shaco invades, but I decide health would serve me better. I gank bot and survive with 10hp. My adc gets a double kill and my decision pays off.\n\nPlants kill the magic that makes our decisions worth something.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HEXXEN9x","date":"2016-11-06T12:49:31.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks riot!

Therefore, most people won't use it to look at their own jungle, which leads the  back side of a scryers bloom to be one of the safest places to place a ward, which isn't very intuitive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Desert","date":"2016-10-25T21:25:31.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly i have no PBE acc so i need to write it here:\nWhat do you think about breaking the power of the plants into 2 stages?\nThe two are \"jung\" and \"adult/old\".\n\njung is a bit weaker then the plants right now, maybe some small debuffs on using them.\n(honeyfruit gives a 10 sec reduced healing debuff(cause the fruits arent ready yet), Scryer's Bloom gives vision, but no ward detection, Blastcones \nknockback distance is reduced or so)\n\nand the adult versions is like the current version or maybe a little bit stronger if wanted.\n(honeyfruit does not give a debuff anymore and more fruits/healing, Scryer's Bloom reveals now wards too, Blastcones have a bigger radius or does a bit fire dmg to knockbacked enemys etc.)\n \nThe main reason for this change is to make you decide: using them now for a small advantage, or taking the risk of the enemy possibly taking them but if not than you get a bigger reward.\nThis would improve tatical desicion making around those plants alot.\n\nAnd as an extra: if the enemy uses a plant, then you can \"rescue\" it in the 30sec timeframe where they are \"withered\", to make them respawn as a seedling instantly( they still need 60sec to be used and then they are only the \"jung\" version). So even if the enemy roams or gets far ahead, you still get some windows to react to that.\nWhat do you think about this idea?","replies":[]},{"poster":"WildEmpyrean","date":"2016-10-25T20:55:07.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blast cones just feel way to clunky and useless to me.
