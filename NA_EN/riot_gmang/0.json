We&rsquo;ve got a bunch of other objective changes to Summoner&rsquo;s Rift going in the patch, and I wanted to share those + context with ya&rsquo;ll and take your questions and feedback!\n\nEverything is subject to tuning and future iteration, of course.\n\n**Rift Herald**\nWe&rsquo;re pushing to make Rift Herald a more unique and meaningful objective for those looking to dominate the top half of the map. This new Rift Herald should be a more contestable objective with a clearer purpose: long-term selfish power for one team member - especially a lone-wolf or split push character.\n\n* Rift Herald now spawns at 6 minutes and **never** respawns\n* Rift Herald&rsquo;s stats significantly increased (should be much harder to solo)\n* Doom&rsquo;s Eve removed and replaced with a unique Superbuff:\n * Lasts 20 minutes and persists through death\n * While alone, you gain some damage reduced vs. champions and build Corruption stacks\n * At 100 stacks, your next attack discharges all Corruption to deal bonus magic damage (works on almost anything, including minions and towers; damage is reduced for ranged attacks)\n * Corruption stack rate and discharge damage scale with champion level\n\nHopefully this excites top laners, junglers, and some mids. We&rsquo;re keeping an eye on it to ensure it&rsquo;s powerful, but also contestable and not too game-ending.\n\n**Red and Blue Buffs**\n\nLate-game, Red and Blue buff have been somewhat ignorable these days. We&rsquo;re buffing and compressing their power in the mid-late game to make them more appreciable objectives to leverage or steal, especially in games that are in a standstill and need things to fight over and create power windows.\n\n* Red Buff\n * Burn now applies a damage tick immediately on apply or reapply (stronger attack-speed scaling); damage-per-tick reduced to compensate\n * Health regen now scales steeply with champ level but turns off when in combat with champions or epic monsters (currently triples at level 6 and again at level 11!)\n* Blue Buff\n * AP per level replaced with +15% total Ability Power (like Rabadon&rsquo;s Deathcap effect)\n * Mana regen based on max Mana doubled (flat regen unchanged)\n* Buff Durations\n * Red and Blue will last the same duration on your first clear, but all Red and Blue buffs after that will have a 90-second duration instead of 120\n\nWhen you&rsquo;re looking to make a play in mid-late game, buff camps should be juicier targets now, especially if you can steal them from the enemy&rsquo;s side of the map!\n\n**Camp Respawn Timers**\n\nIn order to facilitate more coordinated and contested objective play at all skill levels, we&rsquo;re making a some UI changes. This also has the benefit of reducing timekeeping and chat-typing work.\n\n* When a camp that has a timer (Red, Blue, Dragon, Baron, Rift Herald) has less than 60 seconds to spawn, its timer is revealed to both teams at that time (regardless of their vision of the camp), and an &ldquo;about to spawn&rdquo; icon appears in the minimap simultaneously (will replace regular camp icon if you still haven&rsquo;t seen the cleared camp by the time its respawn has 60 seconds left)\n * To clarify, if you never have vision of enemy jungle, you won't see any changes for the first 4 minutes after their camp dies. But at 60 seconds remaining to respawn, you will get new information over live.\n* The respawn icon starts dull at 60 seconds to spawn and becomes bright at 20 seconds\n\nWe generally like seeing more fights around objectives, and promoting objective awareness like this can help a lot. After getting used to the new UI, rallying your team around a Dragon spawn or even a buff steal can often be done with a simple ping instead of having to type things out in chat.\n\n**Turrets**\n\nTurrets have several changes in store. Overall, we want them to be more defendable places to stand your ground, reduce their takedown reward compared to other objectives, clean up some of their mechanics, and rebudget their defenses so things other than marksmen basic attacks can contribute more to turret takedowns.\n\n* Turret Damage Ramp\n * Inner and Outer turrets more quickly ramp up their damage when attacking champions, and they maintain full damage when switching targets.\n * Inner and Outer turrets only take 4 shots to ramp up to full damage (instead of 5).\n* Turret Takedown Rewards\n * Outer turret total gold reward reduced, though local gold reward is increased (local gold 220 -&gt; 300, global gold 125 -&gt; 100)\n * Inner turret gold rewards reduced (local gold 250 -&gt; 175, global gold 150 -&gt; 125) and XP reward removed\n * Inhibitor turret local gold reward increased (0 -&gt; 50)\n* AP Damage Conversion\n * When your attacks trigger AP damage conversion (occurs when attacking a turret while your AP is more than double your bonus AD), the converted damage is now magic instead of physical\n* Turret Stats\n * Base Armor/MR increased (from 0 to 40), Base Health decreased (from 4000 to 3300)\n * Turrets are now subject to penetration (generally tankier than Live unless you have about 20 penetration or have a true damage proc; overall a small nerf to marksmen damage, but a buff to some mages and assassins)\n * Reinforced Armor converted from 200 Armor/MR to 66.67% damage reduction\n\nOverall, diving and taking turrets should be less of a freebie than what we&rsquo;ve seen recently.\n\nLet&rsquo;s hear your thoughts!","replies":[{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2016-04-19T21:06:07.771+0000","up_votes":49,"down_votes":3,"body":"Im going to have to say no to that herald change. that looks to be flat out broken.

Currently most rift heralds happen in my games (plat elo) when a top goes missing, and the opposing jungler/midlaner aren't willing/able/attentive enough to roam, and the opposing top doesn't want to contest 1v2 and just die. Essentially, it's a result of one team caring more about their toplaner than the other team. Having a permanent, long lasting buff would only magnify this. Toplaners who are in position to take heralds are already generally winning lane, and this will make them win even harder, so it will likely be impossible for the non-heralded top to stay in lane alone. I don't expect junglers who have been neglecting top to drop everything and come camp top, especially when they are at a disadvantage in any 2v2 and may even lose to a 2v1 (to me, this buff sounds like turning every toplaner into a 3/0 level 6 renekton, which is at the point where you give up top outer and pray he doesn't try to go for inner). It punishes toplaners for not having their team's help, and it will make the game even worse for toplaners who are left to fend for themselves.","replies":[{"poster":"FilipCofi223","date":"2016-04-19T23:50:47.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically you should be able to keep it warded and have your jungler counter gank/ counter the Rift Harald.

That said, I think one of my reasons for initial pushback against no \"effort\" buff timers is the strength it gives invade junglers/punishes late game junglers and kind of forces them into Tracker's Knife.\n\nI think a better compromise of the system would be if **\"visiting\" a dead Red/Blue gave your team the timer & visual indicator for the next one** instead.

A similar thing happened with Baron timer: while we can make people calculate this stuff, it&#x27;s basically public knowledge for those willing to do book keeping on it. How valuable is that to ask people to do?\n\nI think you should fight for that information. Invading the enemy jungle isn't something without risk and it shouldn't be. And of course, you can calculate when their buffs are up, but that applies to a variety of camps excluding buffs. You could do the same with Gromp/Krugs/Raptors buff and calculate what camps are up by counting CS. But the problem is both accuracy and feasibility. In a game, it's very hard to do all this \"book keeping\" as you said, while still pressuring the map, ganking, fighting, and controlling vision. Which is why people invade for vision instead. I do understand the need for removing this \"book keeping\", but if it's all gone, then what's left? A bunch of skirmishes around buffs that favors mechanics and early game junglers over all?\n\nThe higher elo, the more information and coordination people play with. Junglers begin to time their enemy camps, top laners note TP timers, and all laners time summoners and ping you where the wards are. These are all things that can be considered \"book keeping.\" If Riot's going to make buff timers global, why not make enemy TP or flash timers global as well. After all, these summoners spell are even used in vision, so why not? I think the difference is that this information is something that is earned and can then be capitalized on. Having this information directly influences how players play the map and thus better players are more likely to record it. The same goes for these buffs.\n\nFinally, you do have to consider the jungle meta as it is right now. It's likely that if you give timers to buffs, as you've mentioned, that more people are willing to fight around them. Playing against one of the best junglers, Kindred, Nidalee, Graves, Elise, Gragas, as a weaker jungler is already a grueling experience. Giving these strong junglers even more opportunities to fight further restricts the meta. The jungling meta as it is right now, especially in SoloQ, is already hectic enough and I haven't had a stagnant game in quite some time. Making these buff timers public doesn't simplify the game, it removes some of its complexity entirely. You should be fighting for both vision in the enemy jungle and the camps themselves.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2016-04-19T21:04:40.567+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yes, this is exactly what I want.

We're putting more emphasis on maximizing your team's objective participation across the map, while removing emphasis from certain forms of scouting.\n\nWill invading enemy jungle be easier? Well, it will be less dictated by certain kinds of vision play. But that doesn't mean there won't be skillful interaction there, it just means it might be more about optimizing map position to coincide with respawns, and actually fighting in jungle, moreso than gaining/denying vision coverage \n\nWe've felt in most cases that giving players information about things to fight over tends to be net positive in the game being fun and, often, in being skillful. That's not to say no skill has been removed, but the skill check of \"what do you do with this information\" can often be more interesting than \"can you get this information.\" In mechanics like timer tracking, we tend to value the former over the latter. Though that's not true for ALL mechanical spaces.\n\nTo do a simplified analogy: if we were both playing darts, I might suggest \"we should play blindfolded and spin around before throwing!\" Does this make the game more skillful? Well, it applies a kind of skill test that wasn't here before (spacial memory and managing vertigo), which might be neat. But it does so at the cost of another skill value: rewarding actual throwing precision. There's a good chance that the game is worse at testing skills you care about, even if it tests more skills on paper.\n\nIn this case, we're saying \"let's drop this blindfold.\" Both in theory and in playtesting, we find the game more fun that way.","replies":[{"poster":"NotSoEvilDead","date":"2016-04-20T04:01:02.024+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":3,"body":"Your analogy is so off-the-mark that, honestly, I find it to be pretty disrespectful and tone deaf.\n\nYou aren't going to encourage more skillful play with this change.

They certainly made sense for Dragon and Baron: those are effectively \"neutral\" objectives seated between both teams. Red and Blue, however, are rooted deep in either teams' jungle. Essentially giving teams \"free\" information about those buffs spawning almost seems like it creates too _many_ objectives to be managing and rotating to for an average team.\n\nAlready in lower ELO (and sometimes even in higher), you have players panic rush Dragon when contesting it isn't critical and treating every lost dragon, regardless of number, as the only win condition. I really don't want to deal with the # of people who are going to try to rush and steal the new red/blue, then tilt off the face of the planet if they lose it (or God forbid, their own).\n\n20 Minutes on Herald buff is just ridiculously too much as well and frankly, I don't think it's going to accomplish much. Either it becomes an issue where it's so strong, people just wait until late game pre-Baron to kill it so it's less punishing (since its dmg has been buffed), or it's effectively \"traded\" between teams (Red Team goes Dragon, so Blue goes Herald and vice versa) early on.\n\nI think we'll have to wait for some PBE testing to assess, but in their current incarnation I think a lot of these changes are just too strong. (That's not the worst thing for PBE though. It's easier to nerf something that's too powerful than buff something without making it OP.)","replies":[{"poster":"jdizzle367","date":"2016-04-19T23:46:37.584+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im not a fan of it I think it will just make aggressive top laners snowball too far out of control but I think it can be balanced with a little trial and error.","replies":[]}]}]}
