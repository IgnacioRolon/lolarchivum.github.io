The game wasn't lost but because one person decided that they were done with the game because they tilted, we wound up losing without trying. It feels like every game that we surrender could have been won, but the fact that 3-2 can pass a surrender vote sometimes is ridiculous. I think that before 30 a surrender has to be 5-0 and truly unanimous in order to pass, because the game is not fun for many anymore, when our teams just give up and we instantly lose with no attempt at winning at all. Especially when you have a 10 minute queue to play for 20 minutes, lose one fight and now your game is over even though there's like, 3 turrets destroyed on your side total. The enemies couldn't win in the time it takes for you to respawn twice but we surrender. Just saying we need truly unanimous surrenders pre-30, and post-50 to be the ONLY time a surrender can be 3-2 passed.","replies":[{"poster":"Ayanami3rd","date":"2017-12-19T14:58:59.948+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely disagree. If you happen to have a feeding team or 4v5 with an afk player, you just want to quit the game as soon as possible (around 20 minutes usually). I would go crazy if I had to sit through these types of games 30+ mins. People are using the surrender option too rarely instead of too often (just talking about Normals though).","replies":[]},{"poster":"FedPik","date":"2019-02-26T21:00:17.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have been experiencing the same problem as you lately. Teammates that just give up because they either play bad, or someone else is playing bad on the team, and the excuse are alwyas the same thing \"I don't want to play this shit anymore, its a lose anyway\". Now, I see many problems with this, first of all, why would you commit to a maybe 40+ minute, just to have the mentaility to just give up? I mean i thought we started a game to have fun and win. The odds of loosing a game if u surrender is 100%, while all other games if you just continue are in some sort still winnable. Second od all, if u are so willing to just given up, why do you even play games? I know it's frustrating some times to play games where you are behind all game, but think about there is 4 other players that might had'nt hit that stage of absolute tilt yet, and can set u back into the winning seat.\nThe thing with throwing surrenders out there every single time its possible makes people tilt as much as you. They should adopt the valve method where u can only surrender when a person has left the game. If you commit to a full League game, you better play it through","replies":[]},{"poster":"Titanium70","date":"2017-12-19T16:15:47.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sadly it's not a problem of the system which really is fine.\n\nThe problem are exactly the players you mentioned who think games can be lost at 15. \nThey spam surr as soon as they're not roflstomping the opponent... once it gets hard - and actually interesting, they leave the field. Some mentaly some litterally... (srsly... I've seen people Surrender games with Kill/Tower/Gold lead at the same time!!!)\n\nNo idea how to fix this... sadly. \nGuess with all of Riots attemps to make the game intersting for the mainstream... there is no way to fix this. <.<","replies":[]},{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2017-12-19T15:25:51.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"When has there ever been a 3- 2 surrender?  I can't think of any situation where that is even possible.  \n\nOn a side note, this is why I duo.  It's far easier to win games if you can strangle effort out of your team by controlling the surrender vote.","replies":[]}]}
