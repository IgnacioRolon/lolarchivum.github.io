I could easily rework any champion and through a variety of \"I do well in a duo lane for no real reason\" mechanics, make them a viable bot lane carry. But it would just be me forcing the meta, as happened with Morde.\n\nOne token non-ADC going in the bot lane carry role does not change the fact that ADCs have monopolised that position. No other position is occupied entirely by one class of champion (with or without a random outlier).
