He also lacks the pull and double slow that Darius has, making it much harder for him to stick to a target to actually use that base AD.\n\nAlso, that 390% AD scaling?  That requires a level 5 Q.

Build MR.\n2.  Done.\n\nThe fact is that Morde most likely isn't going to build straight AD - doing so makes him fall off hard after level 9 or so, since only Q and E scale off of AD, he's not good as an autoattacker, and his ult (in other words, the thing that he depends on in teamfights) will do very little damage.  In addition, both Trinity Force (which is hybrid) and Rylai's (which is absolutely core on new Morde) don't give much or any AD, and Morde also needs to build tank items to prevent himself from getting blown up.  Even with AD scalings, Morde's primarily going to do magic damage, so building MR (I recommend Hexdrinker or Spirit Visage over Banshee's - it's too easy for Morde to pop the bubble with E) significantly reduces his damage.\n\nPeople also seem to really overestimate the dragon's strength.  It's strong in the early game, yes, but that's also when Morde gets it for the least amount of time.  The dragon does deal a lot of damage (it's damage is based off %max hp) but it's AI is incredibly bad, and it's very easy to lose control of it.  It also goes down quite quickly to any degree of focus.  If Morde can get his team to group as 5, it's very powerful, but otherwise, it's only moderately powerful.\n\nThe W passive is absolutely a problem, but that's a larger issue than Morde's base stats, and one that Morde mains generally want to see nerfed or outright gone.","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2015-10-24T23:18:54.923+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"> The fact is that Morde most likely isn't going to build straight AD - doing so makes him fall off hard after level 9 or so, since only Q and E scale off of AD, he's not good as an autoattacker\n\nWhew!

Just because it scales off of AD doesn't mean it deals hybrid damage.  That's why AD Morde falls off after 9 - once his Q is maxed, his damage output is about as good as it is going to get.  Yes, E scales off of AD, but its damage was significantly reduced, and it doesn't have the impact it used to have.  Again, Morde isn't going to be doing a ton of autoattacking - most of his damage comes from his abilities, and he doesn't build a ton of attack speed to use those autos.  Morde, for instance, will never build PD/Shiv.","replies":[{"poster":"RisenDarkKnight","date":"2015-10-25T00:43:40.027+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah even with an ad build, morde still does about 70% magic damage.
