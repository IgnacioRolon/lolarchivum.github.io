(which is usually base 30) The only champ who exceeds 30 a level one is Rammus. (based off the wiki.)\n\nThough, The major tank shredding items have scattered a bit.

This is in contrast to the weaker early games marksmen tend to have, which is why we rarely see them out of bot lane where it's marksman vs marksman each with a support.\n\nMarksmen did need a change, but I'm sort of bummed that the AD items focus on just them.
