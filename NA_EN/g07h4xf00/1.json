What&#039;s the point of RiotRepertoir responding to things if nothing actually changes? Oh, the {{champion:86}} are less shitty (but still shitty). {{champion:82}} is still ruined. \r\n\r\n{{item:3075}} , one of the LEAST popular armor items IN THE GAME who&#039;s stats haven&#039;t been touched since 2010/2009 has finally been nerfed to a point where it&#039;s no longer good at the job it&#039;s INTENDED TO DO. Great, it does more damage against 80 AD mage auto attacks but less damage against 400+ damage crits and empowered autos. Fucking great. {{item:3110}} is finally back to season 2/3 levels of bad and {{item:3143}} is just bad, except against maybe a {{champion:157}} or {{champion:22}} but even then your {{item:3075}} returns less damage so who cares. \r\n\r\nHasn&#039;t Rito learned that double nerfing fucks their game? This isn&#039;t the first time. This is like a quadruple nerf. \r\n\r\n(nerf armor items stats/effectiveness) \\* (buff AD champions &quot;juggernauts&quot;) \\* (introduce new AD Bruiser items) \\* (increase the price of armor items)\r\n\r\nI can&#039;t wait to watch those pro flashy LC$BIGPLAY$&quot; games where players spend 80% of the game dancing around and NOT initiating fights and everyone gets popped / killed in split seconds and tower dives are even less punished.

Most the other changes to tank items are more or less neutral in my opinion.  It's only Frozen Heart and Thornmail that are outright being ruined, but those are not necessary items for most tanks.  Also Titanic Hydra and Sterak's Gage are pretty significant additions to tank options allowing for tanks to add damage and/or survivability on top of their basic tankiness.  Titanic Hydra in particular, functioning as a single damage item, is going to be huge for a lot of tanks.  Also let's not forget the MR buffs and the many armor items that are going unchanged.  I do think the Cinderhulk changes are a pretty big hit to tank junglers, making it more of a bruiser jungle item since it's better on its own while granting less power when building really tanky.  Overall I think these changes are pretty questionable, but I don't think tanks are dead.","replies":[{"poster":"Fearless","date":"2015-08-20T00:05:57.653+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":31,"body":"So on the Frozen Heart and Thornmail changes, two points.

I honestly don't know as I'm not sure about how the math works out with the scaling off your bonus armor. Best I can think of is to give it some other stat besides just armor to make it have a general purpose niche of some kind (Like how Frozen Heart gives mana) of which the only defensive stat I can think of that isn't given by an armor item (Except through a unique passive) is movespeed but I don't know if it would make sense to put movespeed on it.","replies":[{"poster":"Fearless","date":"2015-08-20T00:34:16.247+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":15,"body":"So if we need to buff these items, you are correct that we'd look first at the unique effects the items have.

Definitely the only option, but we want to make sure items have more power tied up in the things that are special to them.\n\nThe one \"unique\" thing about {{item:3075}} got nerfed. It's supposed to be the anti-basic attack item. Now it returns half as much of the damage dealt by AD. What, is it now a hybrid \"sort-of anti-basic attack, sort-of armor stacking\" item??\n\n{{item:3143}} had a unique identity. It was the anti-kiting item. It used to give a 10% movement speed debuff on-hit. It reduced kiting potential that ranged champions had and allowed for easier gap closing. Now, it no longer gives the 10% movement speed debuff (yes I was super salty last year when you guys removed it) and now is an anti-crit item? Wasn't {{item:3075}} supposed to be the anti-crit item? So which is it? Is {{item:3143}} built against crit or attack speed? Or is it just built no matter what because it's a ball of stats that just gives 60 armor/400 HP now? Where's the uniqueness? The new {{item:3143}} overlaps MORE with the new {{item:3075}} than previously.\n\n{{item:3110}} was a straight up nerf. Did we forget the days of season 2/3 when nobody bought this item? The stats weren't too different from before. Also, was the item gold efficient? Sure. If you ignore its mana stat (which is a deceptively useless stat if you think about it), it's not THAT gold efficient. Also, why was increasing the price not an options? Why ALSO reduce 10 armor? {{item:3110}} is the anti-attack speed item yet why does it have the same amount of attack-speed debuff as {{item:3143}} ? Doesn't feel that unique. \"Oh it has an aura\". Yes, an aura that is 700 range. The attack speed reduction itself (to the user) feels the exact same as the one from {{item:3143}}.\n\nHow about this: Keep the 90 armor on {{item:3110}} but I want to see at least a 30% or 35% attack-speed debuff. On that note, {{item:3143}} should have no attack speed debuff and double down by giving 25% crit reduction. Aren't all these changes about being unique? Do you see the hypocrisy of this?

Definitely the only option, but we want to make sure items have more power tied up in the things that are special to them.\n\nI think you need to make the unique aspects of the items more appealing, and really look at what they will be against, more than just make them \"special\".\n\nFor example, Randuins will without a doubt become the new go to over frozen heart because of the crit mitigation, because Crit is an easy to obtain and must buy for Marksman right now. Any mitigation to Crit will be highly prized, so basically you guys just went full circle from making Randuins the most bought, to Frozen heart, then back to Randuins again.\n\nUnique doesn't always mean good, like with Essence Reaver vs Bloodthirster. Sure Essence Reaver is \"unique\" but not really unique enough. The special ability isn't that great against anything is the problem, whereas Bloodthirster has more lifesteal which is the real thing people want, plus that shield.\n\nI think there needs to be less of a focus on \"unique\" and more of a focus on useful vs X and Y, like Randuins is now. It may take a couple of days, but I can promise you pros are going to rush for Randuins just like they used to before the nerfs to it and buffs to Frozen Heart. \n\nIn reality these changes have made unique items, but just lowered the real choices, because the unique aspects (10% crit mitigation is a big deal right now) honestly take the choice out of the choice.\n\nYou have to now be even more careful how you balance, because if you say, lower that to 7% crit mitigation, or 5%, since you guys like to buff and nerf in percentages of 5, then what is the point of the unique aspect, and no one will get it and just spam frozen heart.\n\ntl;dr\n\nYou have \"balanced\" your way into a very awkward corner when you look at the entire picture.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-08-20T02:37:35.180+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"My biggest problem is Thornmail.

There isn't some games where like say an ADC would say \"actually I don't think I want to buy {{item:3035}}).\" ADCs don't suddenly stop building damage because of what an enemy champion might happen to build. A tank wants to stack as much survivability as possible just like an ADC wants to stack as much damage as possible. This is a simple concept. \n\nThis isn't giving more diversity. A tank is still going to stack ALL of the items (if possible).

In a small window of time, tanks are given viability with some changes in items and then a few patch later are nerfed back into irrelevance. Meanwhile ADCs are in every game will always be viable and are always strong.  It's a never-ending cycle of disappointment. Count how many tanks are ACTUALLY being played in the average pro game or average non-pro game. Seriously, count it.
