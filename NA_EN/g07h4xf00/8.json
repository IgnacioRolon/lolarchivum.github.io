In Season 3, the special focus was on assassins and mid lane. In Season 4, the special focus was on supports and bot lane. The changes that seem to occur in every season are \"change the jungle\" and \"break top lane.\" Where the hell are the season 5 top lane changes? All I've heard is Ghostcrawler and other oblivious Rito 'designers' scratching their heads and offering empty promises that things are going to get better after they CONTINUE TO MAKE THINGS WORSE. \n\nNobody, and I mean nobody, who is a top lane main actually enjoys the current top lane cancer meta {{champion:13}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:150}}. Notice what these three champions have in common? They are all ranged, super fucking cheesy, and extremely frustrating to play against. The meta was not as bad a few patches ago when {{champion:57}}, {{champion:12}}, and even {{champion:36}} were seeing a lot of play. But of course, Rito doesn't believe in fun. They nerfed {{champion:57}} and {{champion:12}}, and {{champion:36}}  naturally stopped being picked because of the cancer top lane meta. \n\nThose last {{champion:76}} \"nerfs\" were a fucking joke. She was a lane bully before the nerfs and she continues to be a cancerous lane bully after the nerfs. What happened to the {{champion:13}} PBE changes that removed his mana ratios from his W and E? How is it that a champion with no skillshots and does more damage from building defensive items is allowed to both be a lane bully AND a late game monster? Removing 40 base damage from his Q at level 5 CLEARLY shows that Rito doesn't understand the problem with {{champion:13}}. The fact that {{champion:150}} has an \"uncontrollable transformation\" is no excuse for his r%%%%%ed kit. If he's small and squishy, he's impossible to catch because of kiting, movespeed buffs, jumps, etc. If he's big gnar then he is tanky (literally 1v2 the enemy top laner and jungler), and can basically chain 5 seconds of hard cc and permaslow assuming he lands his boulder.... against a melee champion... at point blank range.... with a reset....\n\nWhat the fuck happened to {{champion:98}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:122}} etc? Like, ACTUAL top laners? Champions that are actually possible to farm against and don't cause the most anti-fun and frustrating experience in the game? Rito loves spouting bullshit about how they don't like \"anti-fun\" and yet look how they've mutilated top lane. I fucking miss duking it out in season 3 against whatever tank/bruiser/fighters used to be picked top lane. I can't believe I'm actually saying this, but I MISS the {{champion:58}} bar. Seriously, the current state of top lane makes {{champion:58}} seem like an adorable poro. Why the fuck would you do this, Rito? \n\nFix that shit. New seasons are supposed to be about major game changes but all I see is yet another season of doomed top lane and more jungle changes. I agree that jungle changes are necessary (since you can't seem to get that right either) but come on! You aren't allowed to buff a single thing about bot and mid lane for at least 3 seasons to make up for all the bullshit top and jungle has had to put up with. \n\nJust look at the changes that have happened since Rito \"promised\" to fix top lane after people started complaining about it after the mid-season ADC buffs: \n\n- They released {{champion:150}}. Wow, more ranged cancer. This is exactly the opposite of what any fucking top lane main wanted. \n- They \"nerfed\" {{champion:76}} so now you can build her as an AD Bruiser (exactly like before) OR as an AP depending if your team needs it. How are these nerfs? \n- They nerfed the last two remaining tanks from top lane {{champion:57}} {{champion:12}} but don't worry they were kind enough to RETURN the attack speed de-buff from {{item:3143}} back to 15%. You're too kind, Rito! Clearly this fixes EVERY problem?\n- The very concept of Kalista was introduced. Enough said. I would NOT be surprised if she became a \"meta top laner\". Build her attack speed (botrk/triforce) and tanky so she can proc her bullshit 20% max hp W more often, soulbind with the jungler, and kite melee champions FOREVER. \n- Promise to remove {{item:1057}} from the game, LMAO! MR Itemization is already the WORST itemization in the game, now it's going to be even shittier because the ingredient items are shitty.  \n- Go on a champion kit copy+paste spree by literally introducing, like, 10 or so champions in a row that have a skillshot+slow in their kit, a knock-up (because fuck champions who build tenacity), and %max HP damage. With so many champions that do %max hp damage what's the point of building HP anymore??\n\nI don't understand what is Rito's obsession with adding new elements to the game BEFORE fixing current broken ones? I don't give a fuck about tower changes and some new dragon buff or shitty new items that no one is actually going to buy.  Make the game a non-frustrating experience for people to play. There shouldn't be only 10 or so champions that provide this non-frustrating experience. \n\nIt's truly sad that League of Legends peaked at Season 2 and it's ONLY been downhill from there. \n\nTL;DR: fuck you Rito for ruining top lane again and again. You're a fucking piece of shit.\n\ninb4 \"top lane QQ\", \"melee vs ranged QQ\" ","replies":[]}
