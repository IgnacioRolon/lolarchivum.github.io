This is debateable and can be highly controversial, but I'll just quickly give some of my own personal ideas that you can downvote me for. \n\n{{champion:67}} ?\nTank buster or squishy annihilator/assassin: choose one.\nIf you want her to be a tank buster, keep the Silver Bolts procs as-is and remove her AD steroids from her Q and R.\nIf you want her to be a squishy annihilator / assassin, make the silver bolt procs do flat true damage only or make it do magic damage instead.\n\n{{champion:412}} ?\nRemove the shield from his lantern. What's the point? Lantern is good for moving your allies around. It'll still be good without the shield.\nRemove the passive portion from his flay. The active already has CC and damage. Why have a passive portion? Extra magic damage on ranged-autos why?\n\n{{champion:40}} ?\nI honestly think she's fine. If we really want to do anything then maybe give her tornado a smaller width / higher cooldown and reduce the knock-back of her ult? \n\n{{champion:103}} ?\nProbably just remove the movement speed from her Q. That's all she needs, honestly. I don't think she's too bad.\n\n{{champion:222}} ? \nI don't really have anything against her I think she's fnie. Maybe reduce the range of her Q rocket auto's. It already gives her magic damage on-hit and AOE crit/damage, why make her safer to play? \n\n{{champion:92}} ?\nI could write a PhD thesis on changes with her.\nJust some ideas:\n- Remove AD scaling from her shield completely.\n- Make it so she can't jump over walls with her third Q anymore (like the old days). She can already spam her Q and E on ridiculously short/non-existent cooldowns, make her have to use them to go AROUND walls so it's less obnoxious.\n- Change the knock-back on her third Q to a short slow instead. It shouldn't be able to cancel channels/teleports/abilities. Hard CC on an assassin? Why? She already has a stun...\n- Reduce her base movement speed. 340 on a champion with 4 dashes who also builds {{item:3044}} and {{item:3142}} ?? \n-Reduce her base AD. 56-107 is pretty good for a champion who builds full AD and gets a million AD steroids. Isn't {{champion:61}} punished with a really low base AD for having a passive that gives her magic damage on-hit? Yes, she's a different class of champion but Rito always does this. Gives some champions a really good steroid and nerfs their base stats to compensate. They didn't do this with {{champion:92}}, for some reason. \n\n[Honorable Mention] {{champion:39}}?\n-Reduce the duration of her stun to scale from 0.5 seconds to 1.5 seconds instead of 1 to 2. \n-Hiten Style gives too much healing (her ult already heals). Reduce the healing flat damage to half the amount or make it a % lifesteal amount so building {{item:3078}} into full-tank won't allow her to heal flat 13-26 HP per hit. \n-Make the tenacity on her passive more interactive. Maybe she has tenacity against champions she's engaging. Maybe say like \"reduces durations of disables from champions she's damaged with her abilities or basic attacks in the last T seconds by X%\". Makes it good when she's dueling or hunting down a single champion but easier to get stopped by peeling abilities from her target's allies. Right now it's just free stats. \n \nJust some ideas off the top of my head. I haven't thought about it that hard but these were things I felt were \"obvious\" problematic elements. \n\nLet the downvoting begin...","replies":[{"poster":"The Iceborn","date":"2019-09-22T10:22:39.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reviving old threads that already had their time to shine is against [Universal Rules](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/ITFIpNUE) and as such I will be locking this thread to make sure it lands at the bottom of the howling abyss.

Well, 19.97% off all loosing comps have a thresh in them... so in the end, it doesn't show us much other than winrate does...\niT's a even worse indicator for champion power actually, cause while pickrate is a factor in some way, it doesn't say as much over the actuall power level than winrate while it's a bigger factor i your math as pickrates differ far more than winrates.\nA champion with 10% pickrate and 100% winrate would be less powerfull than a champ with a 80%pickrate and 20% winrate by your approach...\n\nWinrate is the defining factor for power, however it usually is biased by many other factors, so it has to be seen in conjunktion with thos other influences.\n\nPickrate is a factor, mostly in that high pickrate correlates to lowers winrate and low pickrate increases winrate compared to what should be by raw power of the champ.\nA low pickrate champ usually does better cuase his enemies probably never face him and have no experience in that matchup.\nChances are also that low pickrate champs fill a very specific niche and thus usually get used as counter picks vs certain strats/picks, which means they are mosly played in an enviroment they thrive in.\n\nHigh pickrate champs how ever are well know, everyone probably has played vs thresh a couple of times and knows the matchup(probably also played **as** thresh, which helps even more at playing vs him)\nThey also oftern get picked regardless of counterpicks, so they run into bad matchups for the sake of playing the FotM.\n\nAlso, as ChaoticPinecone explained, you have to see pickrate in corelation to ban rate.\n \nAnother important factot is winrate in comparison to player games with that champ, cause else high skill floor/cap champs would apear weak.\nCompareing winrates atr 125+games, so the winrates of mains does show how well those champions perform if used to their max potential(though still biased by pick-reate realted matchup experience, counterpicks etc)\nThis however hets influenced by counterpicks. 'Mains' often pick their champ regardless off the matchup, so it can happen that mains have a worse winrate than people with less games on that champ.\nSona for example has 53.2% win for players with 5-15 sona-games, but only a 52.2 winrate for players with 125+ sona games.\nThis ofc also means winrates should be seperated for differnt elos, as their might be a difference in the skill required to play compared to the skill required to play against, leading to different winrates in different elos.\n\nAnother factor is how team-reliant a champ is, so in which style of teamcomp he works best.\nFor example: Champions that are strong in pickcomps for usually have a worse performance in soloQ than in competetive 5v5, as pick comps need a high level off coordination than death-ball or siege comps.\n\nWinrate based on gamelength compared to average gamelength is a factor aswell\nIf all champions that have a high lategame winrate have a overall low winrate, maybe it is to hard to reach lategame.\nIf all champs that have a strong lategame have a overall high winrate, maybe it's to hard to abuse a weak early and finish befor late(or the earlygame of all of them is to strong compared to their lategame power)","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChaoticPinecone","date":"2015-08-14T00:58:20.735+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The one problem with your analysis:\n\nThe pickrate and winrate for highly banned champions.
