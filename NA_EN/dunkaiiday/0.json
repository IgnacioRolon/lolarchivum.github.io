It was because if you were first pick, you could almost always get the lane you wanted and even though there would be a chance of being counter-picked, you had the ban so that you could ban out your counters. But now, it&#039;s almost the opposite. Not only has the new ranked system enabled players to almost always get the lane that they wanted (primary/secondary roles), the last three picks each get to ban champions-&gt; meaning that they could ban out the counters. Now what about the first pick? They do get the roles they want, but it is so unfair for them as they get countered but yet cannot ban them out. Now since almost everyone gets the roles they want, can we revert it back so that the first pick could have the ban power again?

Say you're first pick and you main {{champion:39}}. Good chance the enemy locks in something like {{champion:86}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:54}}","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2016-06-04T13:01:27.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Look at the time stamps next time, man. 5 months old.

First pick (or even second) is a huge disadvantage.
