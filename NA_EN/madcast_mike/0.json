We are MadCast Gaming, and we're looking for some mature folks to enjoy playing games with.\n\n#**What Is MadCast?**\n\nMadCast is a gaming community that has been active for the past ten years. We've worked very hard to create a place on the internet free from the dregs of gaming. Our [Code of Conduct](https://www.madcastgaming.com/ips/forums/topic/9584-intro-madcast-code-of-conduct/) is a product of those years, and the reason people have come and remain Full Members. We started out as a forum based group that incorporated a VoIP, and now we have grown over the years to be a well established community. You can find out more on our website, www.madcastgaming.com, or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/3Zk6h92).\n\nIf all this sounds like a fit for you, come play some games and help us to continue our legacy.\n\n***\n\n#**What Do We Play?**\n\nWe currently support two main branches: League of Legends and Rocket League. We also have a strong following in Old School RuneScape, Path of Exile, a number of DnD/Tabletop games, and many more! For our main games we host weekly events and tournaments; but we also have a number of tabletop groups and other startups that happen throughout the week. A brand new addition is the rotating featured game of the month! The first month's featured game in MadCast is Destiny 2.\n\nFor League of Legends, we currently host two weekly events, and one main tournament:\n\n* **League of Legends Mafia**\n\nLike mystery? Subterfuge? Boy, have we got an Event for you! Come join us on Tuesdays at 9pm ET for League of Legends MadCast Mafia, the game where one of you is trying to lose. Complete with voting and a running leaderboard, join us on Discord and enjoy ARAM as it was meant to be, with a hidden mafia on each team!\n\n* **League of Learning**\n\nThursdays at 9:00 EST is when we help you with your game! Join us on Discord for some Inhouse 5v5 matches where our admins and players cover team-based tactics and individual skills. Come learn how to better yourself in a non-judgmental environment. Feel free to drop in!\n\n* **MadCast Open**\n\nEvery few months, MadCast runs an online-only public tournament. The first iteration of the MadCast Open was this past June, in which 10 teams participated! Keep a lookout on the Riot events forum, as details are posted there!\n\n***\n\n#**How Do You Join?**\n\nTo be a Full Member of MadCast, you can head to the [introduction section](https://www.madcastgaming.com/ips/forums/forum/5-introductions/) of our forums and post an intro. Feel free to have a look at some of the others if you need some encouragement as to how. Share a little, or a lot! We just want to get to know you.\n\nYou are not required to apply for Full Membership in order to hang out around these parts. If you wish to just hang around and get to know the folks before applying for FM, then the most you need to abide by is that of our [CoC](https://www.madcastgaming.com/ips/forums/topic/9584-intro-madcast-code-of-conduct/). Some people apply right away, and some have taken a year or better to finally decide to apply for FM. The choice is entirely up to you.\n\n***\n\nIf you have any more questions about MadCast or anything of the like, toss us an add in game:\n\n{{champion:18}}  MadCast: Mike\nIGN: MadCast Mike\n\n{{champion:267}}  MadCast: RedJustice\nIGN: MadCast Red\n\n{{champion:102}} MadCast: Dez\nIGN: MadCast Dez\n\n{{champion:222}} MadCast: Kitty Stark\nIGN: Kitty Stark\n\n{{champion:25}}  MadCast: Support Welfare\nIGN: Support Welfare\n\nThanks again for taking the time to read this post, and be sure to check us out at www.madcastgaming.com.\n\nWe look forward to meeting you!\n\nDiscord link: https://discord.gg/3Zk6h92","replies":[{"poster":"MadCast Mike","date":"2019-08-17T04:34:26.129+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Recruiting post updated to reflect current events and staff!
