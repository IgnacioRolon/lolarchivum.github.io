This also applies to all other Malzahar skins as well (with the exception of &#039;Snow Day Malzahar&#039;)\n\nI petition to have Malzahar&#039;s passive spell shield as more transparent to show off the colors of the skin that you&#039;ve selected.\n\nTo show you visually...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYy4oC5hSRU&t=169s\nAs you can see, the purple shield completely overpowers the work the graphics team put into the Malzahar skins.\nParticularly at 1:30, you can see the shadow prince malzahar skin's stark color difference when the passive is up.","replies":[{"poster":"ScarletSurgeon","date":"2017-05-26T23:29:37.941+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":3,"body":"You could also say \"Malzahar's rework was a failure regarding the whole champion\". \nThat would be equally accurate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sp33d Zer0","date":"2017-05-26T20:49:07.564+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or how about making the shield have a yellow tint to it with the spell shield?","replies":[{"poster":"Shribble1","date":"2017-05-26T21:25:15.381+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be even better!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2017-05-26T20:36:11.621+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol at 1:30 it even looks like he's not purple due to Passive shield covering him but that he literally has texture changed to purple tone.","replies":[{"poster":"Shribble1","date":"2017-05-26T21:48:10.818+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly!
