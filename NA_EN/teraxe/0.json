By my count I will have about 90k BE after refunds.\r\n\r\nThere is one champ that has always been my favorite, I have played over 2000 ranked games with him, 2026 to be exact, and countless unranked, thousands I am sure. That champ is Warwick.\r\n\r\nThere is only one thing I have ever wanted in this game and that is the urfwick skin. I don&#039;t know if it is possible for me to get 60k BE before the sale ends, I would gladly trade 100 or even 125 champs for urfwick. \r\n\r\nThis just sucks, that I will finally have the chance to get the one thing in the game I have always wanted, and I am going to fall short.\r\n\r\nHere are my stats going back to Season 1 for people that want to check.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/19576570/Teraxe#/ranked-stats","replies":[]}
