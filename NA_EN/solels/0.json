Took me over 3,000 games to get into silver last season. I am sure it will take me another 3,000 games but I think the match making can be better.

Why is it that bronze 2 feels like bronze 5, but bronze 1 feels like fucking plat 1?\n\nHere is some quick advice for B1:\n\n1. Pick ONE champion that is extremely versatile (I used Annie). I would play Annie: Mid, APC, Support, or Top. Only Jungle I would have to switch up to a back-up.\n\n2. MASTER that champion; play nothing but.\n\n3. Focus more on not-dying than getting fed. Especially in Bronze this can be a game changer. Focus more on CS then getting killed. If you don't feed and farm you will be a late game powerhouse; and there WILL be a late game since you didn't feed.\n\n4. Once game hits the 20 min mark make sure you are always with your team. Those 4v5 fights cause \"that one guy was farming top\" can end games very quickly.\n\n\nGood luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Swift2568","date":"2015-03-19T14:55:33.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I stopped playing ranked because I was terrified about falling out of a tier.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DreadPirateChris","date":"2015-03-19T07:10:14.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, it's just bad luck. That's simply not how matchmaking works - you don't get matched only with B1 because you are B1, or only with B2 because you are B2. You get matched based on your hidden matchmaking rank. You still get the same games that you would after the same wins and losses regardless of rank. Some people get failed series or quick demotions out of bad luck often enough to be regularly matched with/against people several ranks higher (a full division would be extreme, but 1-2 levels isn't). If you keep win more than you lose your MMR will go up. If your MMR goes up, you gain more LP for wins and lose less for losses - it's even if you have the average MMR for you rank, disadvantaged if you have a lower MMR than your rank, advantaged if you have a higher than average MMR for your rank. Better MMR = easier climbing (if you can still win). \n\nI have to remind myself of this daily, being at the bottom of bronze. I climbed out of bronze 5 winning 4 out of 5 games since placements, and then got demoted again only because in bronze 4 I lose 21 LP or gain 10 and had a slightly unlucky streak. In Bronze 5 I'm even (15/15). But as long as I keep winning my MMR will go up and next time I promote maybe my LP will be more even and I won't get demoted again.\n(I'm only winning 2 out of 3 now though,  maybe I'm on tilt, heh. I was almost certainly on tilt in placements where only won 3 out of 7 and one of those wins was purely being carried... or maybe it was just the craziness of season opening. Either way I trashed my MMR and my rank.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"paShadoWn","date":"2015-03-19T06:03:57.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am not allowed to get promoted.
