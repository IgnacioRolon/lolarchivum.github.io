The concept design is focused around witchcraft that is more elemental and throne like rather than Lissandra's type of witchcraft. I love this concept so much because it sheds a different light on Taliyah's personality where in canon lore she is brave, smart and kind, but in the concept she is more ruthless, cocky and evil. I grew up watching shows like Sabrina the teenage witch, charmed and the secret circle. These made me love the coven of sisterhood and witchcraft and such. Therefore, I reached out to Nebura to create something I am very proud of!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2019-10-15T22:52:26.972+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is so ridiculously good.

NeburaART drew everything from scratch, I was just the \"product lead\"/ the one who came up with the original concept.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Morgan le Fey","date":"2019-10-16T02:15:20.658+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"holy cow is this what a job application looks like","replies":[]},{"poster":"GilxeN","date":"2019-10-16T08:52:21.959+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not gonna lie, this skin would be the best of all her available skins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Starving Artist","date":"2019-10-15T18:55:00.694+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This needs to gain some traction.
