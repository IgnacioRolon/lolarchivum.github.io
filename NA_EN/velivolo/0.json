Why? The original one was so much prettier. The magenta went better with the overall palette, particularly the blue in her legs. You knew that, didn't you? That's why the new red Elise has less blue in her legs- There isn't that lovely, cool pink to play off of anymore. You only changed it to satisfy a bunch of lore-sticklers who basically exist to give you a hard time over every single lore change.\r\n\r\nThat Ahri splash? Gorgeous. So much better than the one you got harassed into keeping. And I'm not talking opinion. I was an art major, I sat down and really thought about and examined both of those pieces, and I found the splash the \"community\" hated to be objectively better in every way. I'm sure your own artists would agree.\r\n\r\nPlease don't ever go back on retconning summoners. It was a good decision, and it'll be worth it in the end.\r\n\r\nAnd thank you so much for leaving Graves' cigar out of his splash once you removed it. \r\n\r\nSeriously, you guys have been doing this for a while. Who are we? Who is League's community? Just a bunch of random people, many of us with no game design, artistic, or writing experience whatsoeveer. You're great at your job, keep being great.\r\n\r\nI'm being 100% serious about everything in this post and not sarcastic at all.","replies":[]}
