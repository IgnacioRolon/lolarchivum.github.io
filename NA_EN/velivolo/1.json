If I ever got autofilled top, I&#039;d take a nice tank man like Naut and play the game safe. I started playing a little Teemo once I got bold, because who doesn&#039;t love/hate that cute little guy? Old Irelia literally never popped up on my radar. Her model was a bit rough, she&#039;s not a niche I like, and her whole thing about Soraka resurrecting her and then suddenly being able to fly blades around was a bit... Cheesy. \r\n\r\nBUT WHEN THEY SHATTERED OLD IRELIA, SHE BECAME SHARPEST AT THE BREAKS.\r\n\r\nThat first teaser, with the mural? I picked up immediately on her new identity as a spiritual dancer, and IMMEDIATELY FELL IN LOVE WITH IT. It&#039;s hard to explain, but it really just clicked with me and I couldn&#039;t wait to see new Irelia. Her full release and story only made me love her character more. The best part of her story was when the Noxians broke her family&#039;s crest, and she first learned she could levitate the pieces. Your lore and narrative team deserves serious kudos for this. I really see it as a defining moment that ties her character together, and makes everything about her make /sense/. Her whole story had be gripping my seat, honestly.\r\n\r\nHer new artwork is stunning. I actually preferred the first version of her face in the splash (Looking past us, because the battle is ahead and she&#039;s determined to protect her homeland), but the second version is great too. Probably my favorite part is her blades. With all due respect... The old version of her blades was bad. They always seemed kind of disjointed and clunky, and not to move with her. Not so with new Irelia. Her new blades really seem to flow and move with her animations, and it&#039;s beautiful. I read criticisms about her hair seeming too much like a cape when she was on pbe, and I honestly never had that criticism. To me, her identity as a dancer makes her hair more part of her costume. And it still reads clearly as hair to me, so I don&#039;t know.\r\n\r\nSo now I play Irelia all the time, and top and jungle more than I ever used to. I&#039;m not great with her yet, but she&#039;s AMAZING to play. She&#039;s a lot of fun, and I love everything about her aesthetic. I&#039;ve seen a lot of criticisms of this rework and others, and I thought it was important to share a positive viewpoint. I played LoL for years without touching the old Irelia, and when her rework came out I suddenly had to have her and play an entirely new position. Other reworks have been successfull, imo, too. I literally never played Sion before his and now he&#039;s an occasional pick in my &quot;tanky safe&quot; roster, especially top. Don&#039;t play Swain, but he&#039;s more interesting to play against now and his new artwork is way better.","replies":[{"poster":"JohnODyin","date":"2018-07-17T19:01:58.932+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh, thanks, homie.

Speaking of the mural though, any chance we could have some backgrounds/screensavers based on that artwork? Last I saw, they weren't included in the league desktop thingy, which is a real shame considering how well made it all was.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Velivolo","date":"2018-07-18T13:50:59.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JohnODyin,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=3Osk2EEr,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-07-17T19:01:58.932+0000)\n>\n> Ahh, thanks, homie.

I might have gotten around to playing her without it because she's flashy and just looks like fun, but that writing made me wanna FIGHT FOR THE FIRST LANDS RIGHT NOW.\n\n(Also, thanks for her \"This dance kills despots!\" line. It just makes me happy.)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZevBenjamin","date":"2018-07-17T15:36:03.900+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really good read.

I'm an old Aatrox main and I felt like I had no champion to really call comfortable or one that fits with my playstyle, as I'm not entirely sold on the new Aatrox at all. I've been playing a lot of Irelia recently and I love everything about her. Her character, her quotes, her moveset, her voice (oh my GOD her laughs are ADORABLE). Much appreciation to Riot for that rework. I was disappointed at first being an Aatrox main that she would get a rework before Aatrox, but honestly I'm very glad it happened that way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mrmeddyman","date":"2018-07-18T08:17:22.453+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not gonna mention dat music too \n\n{{sticker:sona-playing}} \n\nBest champion theme in the game bar-none","replies":[]},{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2018-07-17T22:30:18.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am not a fan of the new irelia, but certainly it is waaaaay better than the old one.\n\nI just can't manage to understand her, like to me she seems too much counterintuitive >:O","replies":[]}]}
