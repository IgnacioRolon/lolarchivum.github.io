I did check you match history to see who you've been playing as, and it looks like you've played a lot of Blitz/Brand/and Cho'Gath who have already gotten their chests for this season. Regardless of who gets an S, you can still only get one chest per champ each season. \n\nKey fragments are also limited to 12 about every 28 days. Each frag you get also slightly lowers the chance of getting the next until you have all the key fragments you can get for the month.","replies":[]},{"poster":"madouble","date":"2017-06-08T16:26:09.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wieners Revenge,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=2sZEGkry,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-06-08T07:52:32.017+0000)\n>\n> I wasn&amp;#039;t aware that I was supposed to be getting chests whenever I or a teammate got an S.
