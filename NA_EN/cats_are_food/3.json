Everyone complains that dying in 0.28 seconds is terrible, but then you talk about buffing the only two classes designed to STOP damage dealers from simply having their way... and everyone QQs about that, too. There is one simple truth, and only one:\n\nEither\n\nA: Tanks (and enchanters) are strong enough to do their jobs, and be monsters that keep the damage dealers apart via various devices - hoping for better initiation and team positioning.\n\nOr\n\nB: They are not strong enough to do their jobs, and damage dealers roam around doing what every they want.\n\nBoth cannot be true at the same time.\n-------------------------\nYou complained about the Tank Metas and Enchanter Metas. (Which were itemization metas. Nothing to do with the actual classes.) They nerfed the items, but they still felt TOO HARD to deal with!!!!! So they nerfed the classes as well.  But you people STILL needed ways to \"deal with tanks\" because they were \"really hard to kill, QQ!!\" You got Conqueror. Finally people complained they were useless, and needed to do more damage to feel viable, and you learned exactly how hard Tanks and Juggernauts were designed to scale if they ever built damage. I.E. Galio, Malphite, Alistair, J4 and others.\n\nNow EVERYBODY does too much damage which illicits many a QQ, and any talk of bringing the old classes back to standing to start doing their jobs again also gets much QQing. \n\nPick one, or shut up. You can't just want your pet role to feel better, without having a challenge from the other roles. That's what a MOBA is all about. Every champion should be challenging to deal with in it's own right.","replies":[{"poster":"Death by Glamour","date":"2019-01-14T23:11:01.288+0000","up_votes":50,"down_votes":4,"body":"A major issue effecting the game is that riot always take the easy route rather than rolling up the sleeves and doing some serious balance changes during the preseason or midseason.\n\ncase and point {{item:3076}} {{item:3075}} \n\nrather than dealing with ADC lifestealing which was completely broken at the time they reworked these items and it completely fucked toplane AA reliant bruisers which in turn lead to conqueror being added to the game","replies":[{"poster":"Tahminatrix ","date":"2019-01-14T23:26:27.291+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":2,"body":"And even then they don't want pure tanks to feel good about building it since it has a coldsteel passive that doesn't stack with {{item:3143}}\n\n\nTanks complained about being healthpools for adcs to leach off of , and now this item is no longer a tank item, it feels more oriented for bruisers than tanks with the exception of taunt reliant tanks like rammus/galio who are basically bruisers at this point since everyone is made of paper.\n\n\nRemember when riot was gonna make vayne heal based off of her target`s max hp when she gets a kill?

I liked tank meta for the same reason. Yeah it was unnecessary hard to win a fight and than take 2 more minutes just to kill the tank. But everybody would do their job and had their Rock-Paper-Scissor opponents. Mages burstes Squishys, Tanks CCed them and peeled for Squishiys to prevent, that burst, Brusiers peeled the tanks away from the squishys so the burst could work and ADC tried to kill the tanks and bruisersm while the assassins tried the same with the ADCs and Mages. We had a healty circle. Now we have everything just running at squishys and than fighting it out later. \n\nIn tank meta everybody had to do their job and kill the tank. Now everybody just has to kill. It is really anyoing when the freaking whole enemy frontline just runs at the backline while yours tries the same. The squishys just die and than the tanks/brusiers and highly mobile chars fight it out after the imobiles have been just deleted. \n\nMaybe I am exagerating, there are surely positive aspects to the burst meta aswell, you can argue, \"who bursts firsts can protect the squishys after and thus wins\" but for me as a squishy player I have lost my agency I can be fed all I want, when a Vi decides to go at me nothing can stop her, because she needs ult and  W E to kill me. Nothing else. \n\nI'd like to see a state where carries would still die to something like that, but have it take long enough that your team at least could try to react. As it is right now, everything below 3k HP just explodes. \n\nI have won games, where I just AFK farmed. The enemy brusier and assassin waited all fight long for me to join the fight, never blow their spells just to burst me, and since I never arrived they never dealt dmg and my team won. It literally went like that.

Sure I can blow up anyone, but anyone can blow me up too. It literally comes down to who bursts 1st, and after you blow your load you get someone elses load in your face.\n\nThe thing is though, no one will ever be happy until the meta fits them the best, I'd rather we all be in the same state, oh fuck tanks are tanky, better protect the AD so he can shred him. Meanwhile when the chances arrives I'mma blow their AD up.\n\nTanks absorb Magic damage, AD's slowly shred tanks, Mages blow ADs up. It's the circle of life. Bruisers and Assassins can still get in on the mix, but to me, the best metas are Tank/Fighter - Fighter/Tank - Mage/Assassin - Marksman - Enchanter/Tank.

At which point you just requeue into a new game. You see this also with how MOBAs design things now: There's an emphasis on faster games in every version. DOTA was actually the first to do it in 2015 with Turbo Mode because they saw the writing on the wall before anyone else. \n\nThankfully MOBAs also have a thriving esport scene which few games can have but as for game-games, they're just not the \"in\" genre anymore.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PaffWasTaken","date":"2019-01-15T06:59:08.193+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's just bring the game back to late S5, after the {{item:1401}}  nerfs and before the Juggernaut reworks; tanks tanking, carries carrying, assassins assassinating, mages having actual build choices: in short, everyone doing what they are supposed to do, period.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2019-01-15T01:27:12.813+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"You mistake the problem of a Tank meta: \n\nThe problem with a Tank Meta, is not that Tanks are able to do their original jobs.
