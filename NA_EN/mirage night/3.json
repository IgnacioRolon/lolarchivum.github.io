First, here are the stories I was referencing in that post:\n\n{{champion:268}} : [Arisen](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/zmvrQ7I6-short-stories-azirarisen) | [Shurima Event Storyline](http://promo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/shurima/story/index.html)\n{{champion:429}} : [Invocation](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/UTTHinkA-short-stories-kalista-invocation) | [The Pledge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnT8jVCyh_E)\n{{champion:421}} : [Scourge of the Desert](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/creative-spotlight/reksai-scourge-desert)\n{{champion:432}} : [Mountain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX8iSobsKTY)\n\nSpecifically, these champions did NOT get long in-client bios, but had these stories released alongside the champion's official release (which I'm defining as when we activated them on Live servers). I'll refer to these as **launch stories**.\n\nTo give an idea of how I personally think about these: I consider Mountain to be a story about Bard, presented in video form. It tells a story about how he interacts with the world. How successful it is as a launch story is the \"separate conversation\" I'm hoping to have here. Mirage Night, TerraRising, Sneak Dog, and others have all claimed that these launch stories are not good enough. I want to better understand why you all feel that way.\n\nI'm going to assume that short in-client bios are here to stay; but I agree that we need to do a better job making all pieces of a Champion's lore available in one place. For the sake of argument, let's say we put a link in the client for each champion, that brings up ALL of their lore (and heck, links to related champions' lore as well) in one page.\n\n*(DISCLAIMER: I don't know what our plans are around in-client lore. I'm just using the above as an example to frame discussion around the stories themselves)*\n\nSo, with that assumption made, here are some things I'm curious about:\n\n* What parts did you like about the launch stories? What parts didn't work for you?\n* Does the medium matter to you? Are there different mediums that we should explore?\n* What do you think the goal of launch stories should be? How do you define a successful launch story?\n* How much does world-building matter to you in regards to launch stories? Specifically thinking Rek'Sai here, or even [Sion's Reborn piece](http://promo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/reborn/) which focused a lot more on the world around the Champion.\n* Is there other information we should share about champions at launch, in addition to the launch stories?\n\nFeel free to answer some, all, or even give other thoughts not covered here. I'm heading out for a while; I'll jump back in either later tonight, or sometime tomorrow. But don't wait on me... respond to each other, try to elaborate, clarify, or even challenge (nicely!) each others' views.\n\nAnd lastly, quick reminder that everything I say here is my own opinion as a player, I can't promise anything... the usual caveats.","replies":[{"poster":"Icestar1186","date":"2015-05-17T05:31:11.208+0000","up_votes":70,"down_votes":1,"body":"The problem, for me at least, is that the change to short (and I mean SHORT) in-client bios felt like the lore was being destroyed, not rewritten.\n\nLook at Skarner. I will admit he is a more extreme case, but he illustrates my point quite well. Here's his old lore:\n\n> Centuries ago, there lived a race of creatures as ferocious as they were wise. The brackern were unusual beings blessed with the earth's primal magic, embodied in the form of crystals. Their kind knew of an arcane ritual to bind their life's essence to a crystal, communing with the magic embedded in it. With this power, the brackern thrived in the Odyn Valley, protecting both creatures and crystals alike. Despite attacks from those looking to claim the primal magic, it seemed that nothing could get past the brackern's defenses. Nothing, that is, until the devastation of a Rune War. \n>\nA vicious battle was fought near the Odyn Valley and the unleashed chaotic magic poisoned the crystals. The brackern began to grow sick and die, and no amount of defensive magic could reverse the effects. To avoid extinction, their only course was to hibernate underground until the wars stopped. The strongest, most intelligent brackern hibernated closer to the surface to awaken first and assess the world's condition for the return of their race. The recent mining operations and violent escalation in Kalamanda were enough to awaken the first of these vanguards. When Skarner burst to the surface, he lashed out in anger and confusion. Reason eventually won out over his anger when he realized that the agents of the League who found him were simply functionaries. Skarner was invited to the Institute of War to share the brackern's story. In return, the summoners told him about the history that his kind had slept through. Much had been done to curb the unchecked use of magic since the Rune Wars, but it was obvious that the world was not yet safe for his kind to reawaken. For now, however, there is a place where Skarner can use his power to change the world into one to which his kind could eventually return: the League of Legends. \n>\n>\n\"The humans have not yet learned to control their magic - what once was Kalamanda is now a crystal scar on the history of this world.\"\n>\nâ€• Skarner\n\nHere's his new lore:\n\n>Skarner, the crystalline guardian, defends the entrance to a realm deep beneath the shuriman wastes. The few who survive trespassing his domain describe a creature of terrifying intelligence, anger, and precision. What this merciless creature protects, no one knows.\n\nDo you see what I mean? There's _nothing_ left. Before, he was the first of his kind to reawaken, trying to make the world safe for more to resurface. The lore team complained about not being able to tell stories before the retcon. Well, here's one: What is Skarner DOING to help his species? We will never know, because as of the Shurima event, he now mysteriously guards mysterious things for mysterious reasons while being mysterious. In Shurima. What stories can you tell about that? There is less than what you started with, but he couldn't stay the same because Kalamanda is no longer canon, despite it being one of the only real stories the lore team _ever bothered to tell._ We don't have new opportunities. We have a few sentences that explain the bare minimum needed to tell us what the champion is. Not who, what. We don't know anything ABOUT Skarner anymore. He just guards a thing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-05-17T05:39:25.168+0000","up_votes":45,"down_votes":1,"body":"Specifically referring to those four stories...\n\nA) Azir's stories are fine, but they raise questions, not answers. How did Azir get resurrected by Sivir's blood? She's related to him and magic is involved somehow, but how can Sivir be related to Azir when Azir's entire family died? There are any number of explanations, but we have absolutely nothing to go on, so there's no point in speculating. I remember a Rioter getting annoyed that we were asking for answers about that, instead of just speculating to ourselves, but we don't have any hints as to what happened, so what are we supposed to speculate on? There's also the fact that almost all of Riot's recent lore releases have been about new things, with the exception of Amumu's little video. They raise questions about a champion, but since we have no guarantee Riot'll ever get around to answering them, we don't really care.\n\nB) Kalista is a spirit of vengeance. Offer yourself to her and she will get back at someone who wronged you.\n\n...That is all we have to go on. A video, a short bio, and a long story, and they all say the same thing. Again, this is a problem of raising questions that are not getting answered. It's like instead of including a short bio for people who don't care and a longer story for people who do care, Riot just decided to make the short bio and the long bio the same thing, just one has more words in it. Invocation is more about the sword-wife that Kalista pacts with than Kalista herself.\n\nC) This is good, primarily because this is a champion that Riot's primary long story concept works on. This also happened to Kalista and Amumu's longer lore, and to a lesser extent Gnar's, but Riot's been fond of having some normal denizen of Runeterra (or Rengar, in Gnar's case) react to the champion, to make them look larger than life, and make them truly worthy of being called a 'champion'. The problem is that these stories are actually about the point of view character; we empathize more with the narrator than the champion. This works for Rek'Sai because she's less of a character and more of a hazard, but none of the other three have anything explained about them. This shows us that their origins are shrouded in mystery to the average denizen of Runeterra, but we're not the average denizen of Runeterra, especially now that summoners are not a thing. We should not be guessing about every single champion that has been released since the retcon; it gets boring. It's like a series of murder mysteries that never explains the murderer; it just skips from one to another and you're still wondering 'Did the Butler from the first case do it?'\n\nD) Bard's entire thing is being cryptic, which wouldn't be a problem if, again, I didn't think that narrative will never get back to him and therefore speculation is pointless. I learned more from having Rioters explain the video than actually watching the video. It's nice, but it's not something I can get my teeth into and analyze, you know?\n\nAnd as for Echo...that short form lore is the worst I've seen since Rammus'. It's just  badly written (it sounds like a elementary schooler doing a book report; it's just a listing of his most sapient features, with no rhyme or reason to placement.) I'm going to rewrite it right now:\n\nA prodigy from the rough streets of Zaun, Ekko uses his invention, the Zero-Drive, to explore the branching possibilities of reality and twist any situation to his advantage. Whenever he's not experimenting with multi-dimensional probability, he can be found running wild with the other lost children of Zaun. He revels in this freedom, and whenever something tries to threaten his friends, he's willing to endure anything to defend them.'\n\nSame basic words, just put together in a way that the sentences actually flow. (I removed the last sentence because it just felt like a tagline to an action figure, which is kinda what lore is reading as to me recently.)\n\nThe video, meanwhile, falls under the same thing that the Azir video does; it raises more questions than it answers. The only things it states are Ekko's abilities and his basic philosophy. It doesn't explain who the memorial is for, who he's fighting against, why he's fighting against him, etc. It just raises a bunch of questions that narrative will fail to answer.\n\nHonestly, I don't have many problems with the launch stories themselves. But I want things other than launch stories; I want actual character development, not just character establishment. All Narrative seems to exist for is to write little story blurbs and cool advertisements for new stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"Zeta","date":"2015-05-17T08:49:49.722+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hellioning,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=0lfN1fln,comment-id=00000003,timestamp=2015-05-17T05:39:25.168+0000)\n>\n> C) This is good, primarily because this is a champion that Riot's primary long story concept works on.

Or if it does, it will be done comic-book style, in that a Champ will be killed before a rework in lore and then brought back.\n\nWe get to experience lore from Mr. Nobody's point of view because the Lore writer swore that lore without the League can have lasting consequences.\n\nYou can't reconcile eternally milking a character with the possibility of irrevocably changing them.\n\nSo instead - we have to see the new lore from the point of view of nameless Runeterran goons we don't care about.  Why?  Because they're not being sold, so Riot can put them in peril, and have their \"lasting consequences\" they touted so much when they killed the League.\n\nBut I don't care what happens to \"Noxian Helmet Bro Number 3\" or \"Shuriman Dude Who Got Fondled By Amumu\".  I. Just. Don't. Care.  And I don't think most of the fandom and player base does, either.   \n\nYou don't read the X-men comics to hear about the life of a pizza delivery boy who was once saved by a stray Sentinel blast by Colossus and then went home and went about his day, never once looking back at that superhero fight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Baron of Bread","date":"2015-05-17T08:27:44.412+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":9,"body":"You seem to mostly have issues with Riot keeping secrets.\n\nI think that some of the secrets they keep are only really meaningful if they are secret.  Take Kalista for example:\nYou can tell she is a spooky specter with scary secrets.  I think her character would suffer if we knew _exactly_ why she is the way she is.  As is, we can infer that she is Shadow Isle's (duh) and that something serious must have happened to her to make her the way she is.  This something is likely a very strong form of betrayal and is probably not something she has gotten even for, since vengeance spirits tend to go away after they do that.  She is in the Mordekaiser/Hecarim range of undeath, which means she is kind of a big deal and is one of the older undead, possibly from the Shadow Isle's transformation time.  After that it is more or less pure speculation, but we have a strong idea about her story and character without the specifics.\n\nI think that most of the questions around the less mysterious champs (like Azir) should have the information around to make those questions answerable if we really think about it (and we should probably be able to get multiple answers reasonably).  For the more mysterious champs that are about the past (like Kalista), answers should be more speculative but information around their mysteries should be available in the same way that the less mysterious champs questions's answers are.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-05-17T16:26:09.509+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the thing; if we're never going to get the answers to something, why bother asking questions?

Why? Well because, Sivir was kind of already established as a character. No one really had questions about her, unlike the Ekko x Jinx x Vi x Caitlyn x C fiasco, like most people mentioned in here. She was known as a wealthy mercenary, and that's really all we ever knew. \n\nHere, I will now commence creating a terrible short description (sort of a general example) on how revealing Sivir being related to Azir would have been a secret that you have revealed.\n\nSivir was a child of prophecy, meant to save her village of the Noxian invasions. By learning the truth of her ancestor once deemed a ruler, she will rescue her people. She has come to the league in hopes of learning the secrets affiliated with her mysterious ancestor. \n\nSee, now revealing Azir being related to Sivir would have been more of a reveal instead of a simple ''Oh okay, well that's new'' sort of thing.\n\nNow, the reason on why Sivir's relations to Azir would be important to some people, is because Riot has never mentioned any connection to Sivir having some god ancestor. \n\nNo one ever really speculated on Sivir being related to Azir.\n\nTo put it into better terms, imagine you were a LoL lore fan not working with Riot, and another fan just like you, out of the blue tells you Sivir is related to Azir. \n\nWhat would be your first reaction? Mine would be, ''where is your proof'', AKA ''how is Sivir related to Azir?''\n\nSo I see the question brought up of Sivir's relations with Azir more of a reaction to something new rather than a question lore fans are asking.\n\nHope I answered your question.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zeta","date":"2015-05-17T08:42:29.072+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Kalisa's lore is ironically probably the easiest of the most recent releases to piece together if you know the story of the Shadow Isles and just buy Blade of the Ruined King on her.

She had strong lore connections to Noxus due to being hired by them a lot, which also gave her connections to Demacia because she likely fought against them whenever Noxians hired her. All that created an infinite list of possible stories - Sivir is now freelancing but is also hated by Noxus, which means she could be hired by her former enemies to fight her former allies in order to create a cavalcade of warfare drama. Whether it's her being recruited by Demacia for a cover operation or sought out by Ionia for uniting against a common enemy, she has massive potential for interacting with others.\n\nBut instead, you guys put out the Shurima event, during which Sivir the legendary strategist does the following things:\n\n1. Blindly trust a noblewoman from a country that has a huge grudge against her. A noblewoman who is famous for manipulation and backstabbing, no less.\n\n2. Limp around uselessly and gape in horror while her soldiers get slaughtered by traps, not once considering to change tactics or that Cassiopeia grinning with glee at every death means something is going on.\n\n3. Get stabbed and die without a fight, only to get revived by her distant ancestor.\n\n4. Aimlessly wander off into the desert that has since been revealed to be infested by ravenous burrowing void beasts led by some terrible creature the size of a truck. On her own.\n\nYou have sacrificed the character's *entire integrity* for the sake of one scraplet of information that, due to how it came out of nowhere and was followed up by nothing at all, so far feels completely arbitrary and pointless. It's okay that you consider it a huge thing, but I wouldn't consider it a *positive one*. I personally never once played Sivir since the Shurima event because it repainted her image from a badass leader and warrior into Princess Incompetent.\n\nIf anything, that reveal made me feel like I know less about the character than I did before because her behavior in that story contradicts her character as presented in the game and her lore descriptions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2015-05-17T22:51:49.835+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"We never considered her to be a random mercenary before the retcon.

In fact, before the event, I thought Cass would've added to her story.

Noxus is described as a city-state ruled by the Grand General in Reborn, yet the guy in Scourge of the Desert refers to it as an empire. Which one is true? None of us know. After Katarina and Talon's long-term story arc got flushed down the retcon toilet along with the Kalamanda Conflict, plenty of us doubt that we'll ever know.\n\nIt's all questions and mysteries.

It isn't. That is the WHOLE point of these endless anti-retcon threads. Riot has destroyed everything, and replaced next to nothing. There is no central conflict anymore. We don't know who the key players are now. We don't know where the timeline is or if all of these champions live in the same universe.\n\nWe know **NOTHING** about Runeterra now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2015-05-18T01:53:42.428+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot ShadowStorm,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=0lfN1fln,comment-id=0000000b00030006000000070000,timestamp=2015-05-18T01:33:15.254+0000)\n>\n> No, that's not what I'm trying to say.

I just want to get other factions to that point before jumping forward w/ Freljord stuff.\n\nFYI, it's been **_over three years_** since the Freljord stuff was released.   Three years of lore team changes, broken promises, unexplained at the time lore changes through reworks (Katarina losing her last name for instance), silence from Narrative, the Dev Blog and the most recent revelation that Narrative not only doesn't want our story ideas, they're content in continuing their silence while we shout at them in their ivory towers.\n \nThree-plus years for Riot go get this stuff done and released.  Three years, and NOTHING to show for it but more empty promises, lies, fake apologies and \"tech issues.\"\n\nGranted, you would have a point if there was a consistent, regular release of world building content from Riot.  There hasn't been for THREE YEARS, except Shurima and one half-assed map of the Shadow Isles.\n\nSo, you're saying that every area has to get caught up before we get a resolution to the Freljord conflict?  Bollocks.  The company has had time, excuses or not.  It's time to put up or shut up (and they've all but shut up.)\n\n> Worth reiterating that this is just my personal feeling - I'm not trying to claim what will or will not happen, and I'm not a decision-maker on how we handle lore.\n\nYou chose to dive in these boards with a high and mighty attitude, saying \"Geez, guys... Wait until the lore is released.\"  Saying \"I'm not on Narrative\" now is almost pointless.  These boards are a cesspool of brutality towards Riot and frustration at Narrative for being treated like lepers instead of members of the community your company claims to be working for.  And it's the _entirety_ of Riot Games fault that we're like this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DG Ashabel","date":"2015-05-18T01:41:18.190+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"We actually have no idea about the central conflict.

I understand the idea that if we don't reveal things, then those things might as well not exist as far as players know... but should we really be revealing these things right off the bat? Why isn't it acceptable to reveal them over time?\n> \n> I can't help but think: is Harry Potter a better series if J.K. Rowling puts an appendix at the end of Chamber of Secrets, explaining that Riddle's diary is Horcrux (and explaining what a Horcrux even is)?\n> \n> Or, maybe a better example - what if Snape's background was revealed in Sorcerer's Stone? He literally has a dark, mysterious past for the entire series, up until the final chapters. Would it have been better to tell that whole story at the start?\n> \n> My gut says that revealing that information initially would have made the series much less interesting. Do you feel differently? Or is there just something different about LoL that makes this comparison invalid?\n\nI feel a bit ridiculous saying something as obvious as this but do you really not get that the problem people have with \"Narrative will reveal stuff over time\" is that... you haven't? So far there's been no evidence of you intending to reveal stuff about your champions and the world they live in over time following their release - you quite simply haven't done it. We don't know anything about Azir that we didn't know when he was released.\n\nThe reason people want to find out stuff upfront is *because* we don't find out anything over time. You can't say \"but hey, stuff about Harry Potter was revealed over a long period of time so it's OK for us to do this!\" when people aren't complaining about you revealing stuff slowly, they're complaining about you not revealing stuff at all.\n\nThe community don't need instant information, gradual release of information is fine too. But people are complaining about not getting the information instantly because there isn't a history of getting it if it's NOT instantly. Look at the Shurima event - there's been zero information about that region since that event happened outside of finding out Rek'Sai lives there. We still don't know anything about Skarner, for example.\n\nThe HP analogy is really bad. Your lore is less Snape in HP (relatively big character that is consistent presence in the books, but with somewhat misunderstood intentions) and more Snape if he appeared for 5 seconds in Philosopher's Stone to punch Harry and then was never mentioned again. Snape was *developed* as a mysterious character, but when Riot gives you half a story about someone and then never mentions them again, that's not developing a character to be a mystery. It's just a flat out undeveloped character.\n\nHarry Potter satisfied its characters because the world was gradually built up through each book and the books were released on a somewhat consistent schedule. Riot's lore is more like releasing Philsopher's Stone and then having a two decade gap between each subsequent installment, or just not releasing the second book at all.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
