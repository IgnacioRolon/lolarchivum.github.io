Frankly out of all of the Major assassins, she is really the only one I enjoy, next to Eve (although I dont count her due to the fact she is better played as a tank/bruiser). I think she is the only assassin with no form of CC what so ever.  She has no resources (yes I am one of those) . And she has a &quot;reset&quot; ability. I am extremely afraid that these will change.","replies":[{"poster":"Shaydrox","date":"2016-07-15T10:00:11.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the Assassin update post one of the rioters said they were likely looking at her Q and W, not her being resourceless or having resets. Fair enough I'd say, her Q is meh and her W is just extremely bland, would be interesting to see more happening with it. Not to mention her QEW's very fast and easily targeted nature makes her reset potential too high, so it gets very mediocre damage to single targets as a result.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mr Broken Wings","date":"2016-07-15T05:42:37.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"katas resets wont go away, that would kill her championidentity and they normally dont do such changes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-07-15T05:28:38.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They will likely keep her with 0 cc (maybe a weak or short slow), and many consider her reset mechanic to be iconic to her.  They may add mana to her kit, but if they do, she'll likely receive some range increases or something else to make her early laning phase easier.","replies":[]}]}
