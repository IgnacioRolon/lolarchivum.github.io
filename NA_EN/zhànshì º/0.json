Is this something that&#039;s suppose to be there or is it a skin bug that slipped through some how, or is it something wrong with my league? I haven&#039;t seen anyone else complaining about this. Would love to know if it&#039;s a bug (and if so please fix it. Been bugging me for a while...) and if it&#039;s not I would love to know if there&#039;s anyway to fix this. \r\n\r\nI&#039;ve tried using the skin several times. I&#039;ve even played without the skin and then picked it again to see if the gap is still there, but it doesn&#039;t seem to go away.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-30T02:30:32.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Rixam1,\n\nThanks for the report!

I noticed the hand slipping through the gun as well as the bug with the floating gun. Also, if you stand very close to someone and shoot, the bullets space out into the air. Although I really enjoy the bugginess of this skin, I still thought it's worth mentioning.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
