I was under the assumption the ability to trade in blue essence was going to be a forever thing, and I'm really just hoping I'm just not seeing it. If anyone could give me a step by step instruction, from the client, to find where I can use my blue essence I'd appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-05T18:58:54.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The blue essence emporium have packed their bags for now, but not for good!  I'm not sure exactly when it will return specifically or what contents will be sold, but you'll want to keep your eyes on the [News](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/) page for any announcements.  You can still obtain content through blue essence like unlocking champs, but the special shop is limited.

I told myself I would gather as much for the time it was there then buy the bigger things, but today, less than a month after it opened, it is already gone and I've seen no warnings and no duration were told when it opened... Result I've got 87 000 BE and nothing to do with it...","replies":[]},{"poster":"PROJECTJehuty","date":"2017-12-06T00:49:40.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Porocles,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=yFM8K9XH,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-12-05T18:58:54.305+0000)\n>\n> The blue essence emporium have packed their bags for now, but not for good!

Guess I'll be ready next go around with even more blue essence to spend I suppose.","replies":[]}]}]}
