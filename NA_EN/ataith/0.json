I can't properly connect to the Client. I tried to fix it with the Support page (network settings, ports, etc) and nothing worked.

I dont know why but every log in i get in after the waiting queue and then either have to restart it after 10mins of 'waiting to reconnect' or it takes around 5mins to connect me. I am running on bt infinity broadband and at my other house even better bandwidth and speed. so its not an internet connection issue. Ive seen numerous posts but nothing from riot saying its an issue their end or not. all the similar posts seem to have exactly the same issues. im just hoping that in the next season theyll have sorted this and claim it was never broken, but i guess we will see as they arent doing anything else on any of the discussions....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-17T22:44:27.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're seeing any kind of specific error, that error code might be able to tell us how to get this fixed up.

I have this issue, have had it since urf, and still have it. I've posted about it numerous times and yet have received no support.
