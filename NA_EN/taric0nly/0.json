He doesn't need a change to his Autos in the coding, if you want to take relic shield then learn to cs with him it's that simple. Mages cs mid lane so Rakan can as well, it may be more difficult but that just means you should go cs practice. It will not just help you with Rakan but it'll help you in every other lane as well. Personally I take relic shield on him and it's a blessing, I had to put some practice into being able to cs with him but it's definitely worth it due to how good relic shield is.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-07-23T19:20:20.559+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mmm i don't know much about relic shield on him, coin just always seemed like a better item to me\n\n\nI guess im not the only rakan main who takes coin then","replies":[{"poster":"Chibi Bronzlife","date":"2017-07-23T19:41:46.351+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really it's a matter of how you build him. Their are really 2 theories here, you can build him tank and be full peel or full engage, or you could build ap or utility and be kind of a blend of the two. Obviously the second option wants coin more as you can push the entire team forward with talisman active and have a very good Mana sustain to remain with the team longer. The first option wants relic more for the added tankyness and the single additional target utility for an important teammate.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-07-23T20:01:42.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean i know, i just feel as an item for most situations, coin is just better\n\n\nIt was just personal opinion about the 2 items","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Taric0nly","date":"2017-07-24T01:33:23.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"See I prefer Rakan as a hard engage and I feel coin honestly is worse late game then Relic is due to the quest rewards. Yeah you might be hurting early game but if you play around that then you can make more impact late game. As for the issue of procing relic once you get familiar with him you can proc it without a problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavier","date":"2017-07-24T01:02:23.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Coin is just better.

Even champs with low CD poke tools that are good for CSing, like Vlad or Vel or Syndra, can't just keep spamming the same spell over and over to exlusively CS - you can't get good CS based on using spells alone, and besides, you'll have nothing to poke with and in most cases you'll run out of mana.

It is two things.\n1. In solo q your ADC is not usually going to just let you last hit the minions to proc relic. Sometime they will but in general you rely on the proc to be able to 'out last hit' your adc.\n2. Relic i risky enough because you are always going against 1, if not 2 ranged opponents. The execute on relic gives supports a larger window to be able to safely go and cs the cannon. With rakan being meele range but not able to proc the execute, it will be easy for bot lane to simply wait for a cannon to get within the brief window rakan has to get the cannon and just absolutely punish him or cc him so he misses the cannon.","replies":[]}]}
