What I mean by that is that anyone who stepped into a ranked game or glanced at your boards could've easily told you that the issue was affecting a large amount of your player base and that our outrage stems mainly from a company with as much expertise and as large as riot believing that not acting to preserve the stability of the ranked system for a period of roughly four hours is anything but a slap in the face to the people who enjoy its competitiveness.","replies":[]}]}]}
