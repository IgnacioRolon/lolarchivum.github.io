Just wondering why its doing that.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-06T22:02:58.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This account doesn't have any punishments of LPQ matches right now, so I'm wondering if you were seeing that due to someone in a premade having an LPQ or not?","replies":[{"poster":"FlyingRoboticCow","date":"2017-09-07T13:38:40.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well i wasn't with a premade at the time so i'm not sure maybe it was someone else in the lobby, and just out of curiosity would you be able to tell me if my LPQ timer has decreased at all i had computer issues awhile back and ended up at the max and wondering if I've made any progress towards reducing it.","replies":[]}]}]}
