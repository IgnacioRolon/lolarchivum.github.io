They're only stuck because they are not capable of being that rank.\nYou don't get \"stuck\" there, it's your skill.\nIt depends on how you play, your mmr, not so much on wins / losses, though, that does help.\nPlay your best and don't tilt, you'll most likely get at LEAST silver 5.","replies":[]}]}
