We had a reason for why she would be a champion, what happened to her for her exile, and several potential reasons for her to keep fighting on, but seek a new way in her exile (Singed, her Noxian ideals, Noxus itself).\n\nSo we get this new lore...and her background is pretty much the same, but she is no longer seemingly in command of her unit, Singed is no longer a part of it(as far as her betrayal is concerned) and we hear the name Emystan come up again (previously in the Blood of Noxus comic for Darius). Which if this is a way to hint a new champion coming out, neat, this part is fine either way, we have a change in lore, but it&#039;s interesting and something to wonder at. The issue is with the end parts.\n\n\n> For Riven, memories of the time that followed come only in fragments, and nightmares. She bound her wounds. She mourned the dead. But, most of all, she came to hate the sword that saved her life. The words carved into its surface mocked her, reminding her of all she had lost. She would find a way to break it, severing her last tie to Noxus, before the dawn.\n> But when the blade was finally shattered, still she found no peace.\n> Stripped of the faith and conviction that had bolstered her entire life, Riven now wanders Ionia&rsquo;s battle scarred landscape in self-imposed exile, seeking atonement from those who cannot forgive: the land, the dead, and herself.\n\nShe no longer has any reason to fight. She&#039;s not looking to change anything, no potential of looking for revenge, she just cut and ran.\nShe no longer fits her themes of redemption and a spirit that is broken, but not lost. This lore is fitting of a side story of a character that you will never see, not one who might grace the battlefield with aggression and purpose.\n\n\n\n\n> {{champion:92}}  My spirit is not lost.\n\nWell, apparently it is now.

In the grand scheme of things, Riven isn't a main character of the  lore and she isnt very powerful relative to other league champions, but her story and its personal stakes and the setup she has with yasuo (another, lore wise, weak and unimportant character) is compelling in its own little niche of the universe.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gear5Luffy","date":"2018-04-07T20:37:50.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"did she or did she not kill Yasuos master that part is not clear for me at all","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2018-04-08T14:45:25.272+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats the point\nIts implied and implied only.","replies":[{"poster":"Gear5Luffy","date":"2018-04-09T16:02:39.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so there is a new champ with wind blade elements","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2018-04-09T18:48:59.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not currently,but they might release another champ who has the ability to create a wind cut eventually(they don't necessarily need a sword to create something like this).\nOr heck they might even just introduce an NPC who has such an ability.\n\nAnd even if they do,they might do it just to set up a false lead and then surprise us when it was Riven after all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2018-04-09T18:44:59.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"...what.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Melancholy Exile","date":"2018-04-07T04:38:06.359+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"It doesn't explicitly say it, but we're given:\n\n> _\"Riven’s unit was assigned to escort another warband making its way through the embattled province of Navori. The warband’s leader, Emystan...\"_\n\nThe old lore established Riven as the leader of a company, which certainly conveyed a sense of some scale, whereas now she's only referred to as leading a unit, a term which can't help but feel like only a handful on individuals. It doesn't exactly help matters that previously she was raised up on a pedestal as \"poster child of the Noxian spirit,\" whereas now the wording gives no such grandiose scope to the honour she received and makes her come across as notable but not exceptional - smaller in scope and influence.\n\nPerhaps it is an incorrect assumption, but I find it only natural to assume that Emystan is both an individual of more influence on account of her leading a warband rather than a unit and that she is the one with seniority given how Riven is left totally in the dark about Emystan's plans for the amphorae they transport. It made absolute sense in the old lore that Riven's company became bound to the Zaunites, and indeed played into the feeling of how inglorious the war had become for her, but the way it reads to me in her current bio is that she was a low-ranking officer of some repute assigned to someone higher up the chain in order to make up the numbers.\n\nIf the implication was supposed to be that Riven assumed command of their combined forces then I'm yet to see anyone who has mentioned drawing that conclusion from her new bio.","replies":[{"poster":"Whyte Lyon","date":"2018-04-07T05:46:24.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah well even the Darius comic features the Hand of Noxus as subservient to Lord or Commander (dont recall which) Cyrus.

During one bitter engagement, Riven's unit became surrounded by Ionian forces. They called for support as the enemy closed in around them. What they received instead was a barrage of biochemical terror launched by Singed. Riven watched as around her Ionian and Noxian alike fell victim to an unspeakably gruesome fate. She managed to escape the bombardment, though she could not erase the memory.\n\n>Counted dead by Noxus, she saw an opportunity to start anew.

It represented to her the noxian vision which she believed in and she was continuing to fight for. She has a reason for existing - seeking atonement for the wrongs her country did and trying to save her beliefs. \n\nNow it seems like she is kind of a dead character.
