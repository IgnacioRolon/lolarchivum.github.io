I have been playing league for at least 3 years now. I have played ranked at least once or twice in S5 back in my Main account but never took it serious because of my Ping which was at 250 -  290. But right now I'm craving a little Ranked games however I do not wanna ruin others experiences and climbing because of my Ping but I don't really know if this ping will affect their gameplay or mine at all. I'm a total noob when it comes to gaming on the pc.
