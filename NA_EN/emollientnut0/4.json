I used to have so much fun mixing and matching runes and masteries for my favorite champions and seeing what really fit my playstyle, I remember picking 17/0/13 on my top lane Shen back in the day and thinking it was the coolest thing ever getting healed extra from my Q (RIP Vorpal Blade).\r\n\r\n It&#039;s way more cookie cutter than it ever has been and regardless of this season&#039;s additions, it has just as many non-decisions as the new tree always has (Looking at you, Courage. And Perserverance. And Veteran&#039;s Scars. Well, basically all of Resolve). I know this game will never be immune to change and I&#039;ll always keep up with it&#039;s current state, but for me it was during the keystone release that my personal enjoyment dropped off to a pretty extreme degree.","replies":[{"poster":"Breaku","date":"2017-01-17T15:27:16.430+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, I liked the old system much better too","replies":[{"poster":"EmollientNut0","date":"2017-01-17T17:07:20.270+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the combinations you could make were way more interesting and made the trial and error of mixing things much more fun.

The same thing happened in WoW circa 2004 all the way up until Cataclysm when the talent system was changed to the system they currently use. \n\nThe old mastery trees in League were a bunch of passive bonuses that gave small boosts to everyone, but if everyone is using the same masteries then why even have them since everyone is just getting the same small boosts to their base stats effectively. Might as well remove them and quit with any of the pretense since, when considering optimization, there is no real choice: there's only a mathematically superior option and a mathematically inferior option, and if you're optimizing then you won't take the inferior option.\n\nYou can wear your nostalgia glasses, but remember that there were definitely problems with the past systems, just like there are with this one.","replies":[{"poster":"Breaku","date":"2017-01-18T02:56:07.656+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, you're right in that some of the choices were more specialized than others, but currently there aren't really choices at all.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EndlessIsolation","date":"2017-01-17T15:25:22.007+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'd rather see masteries just get removed and have riot add more run combinations, improve rune cost, and balance rune efficiency better.\n\nIf anyone played Infinite Crisis they had a pretty interesting setup for \"runes\" (just about every stat combination you could think of) and opened up some interesting possibilities.\n\nGranted some runes will be niche (for both certain situations, champions, maps, etc), but having choices and versatility wouldn't hurt (assuming they balanced efficiency vs cost).","replies":[{"poster":"EmollientNut0","date":"2017-01-17T17:02:54.448+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would definitely be interesting to see, but you might even be able to say the Runes are in a bigger state of disrepair than the Masteries are.
