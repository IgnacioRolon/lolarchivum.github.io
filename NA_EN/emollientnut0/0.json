I can&#039;t even play him anymore.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n_Wow, everyone! Woke up this morning to 133 notifications to read hahaha. I'm psyched that a lot of you agree with me, and there's so much support here. That being said, I think something needs to be done. A lot of us don't seem happy with this mage rework._\n\n- I'm fine with items changing. \n\n- I'm fine with the meta changing. \n\n- I'm fine with ADC's being ludicrously viable in 4/5 roles.\n\n- I'm fine with my favorite champion being underpowered in a current meta and needing buffs. \n\n**What I'm no longer fine with is losing the champions that made me fall in love with this game, and instead playing some test-tube Frankenstein that piggybacks off their sprite with a 3-hit mechanic. If you're going to overhaul every champion, item, map and game mode of the game, it seems like a whole lot less effort just making a new game. I personally won't be putting any more money in to the game. If a champ I love and buy 40 dollars worth of skins for gets a rework that I don't like, then it's money wasted.**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI really do love all the effort you put in to creating and sculpting this game, but I honestly think you're at the point now where you're trying a little too hard. I'd love to see your rework money go towards new champions as opposed to changing the ones we already like you for.\n_\nI'd really love to see some Rioter feedback on this post. 157 upvotes in a day and no comments yet._","replies":[{"poster":"D3m37r1","date":"2016-02-23T00:14:43.279+0000","up_votes":44,"down_votes":4,"body":"It's 2{{champion:41}}late {{champion:114}}4 {{champion:38}}me {{champion:82}}","replies":[{"poster":"shyv","date":"2016-02-23T00:57:06.657+0000","up_votes":113,"down_votes":5,"body":"you mained pre rework kass?\n\nyou deserved that","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Timely Voidling","date":"2016-02-22T23:58:09.311+0000","up_votes":53,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"EmollientNut0","date":"2016-02-23T00:02:28.404+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":6,"body":"He was the one (literally) THE ONE champ they got right on release.

I think most of you guys just hate change... all the champions I main that have seen reworks have been great reworks. They've kept what I found fun intact in their kit and added more to them that I like. \n\nAshe for example was an amazing rework I loved playing the champion before and honestly a lot more now. They added so much more fun to the kit while still keeping what I enjoyed alive in the kit. \n\nPoppy is another one, even though I havent played her in a long time what I always really enjoyed about Poppy was her heroic charge. I always thought that ability was extremely fun to use and they kept it while adding a bunch of other reasons to enjoy the champ. (things like her old q / w were extremely bland abilities tbh.)\n\nThese are just 2 examples but I havent had any other champs that I liked get reworked but as for Shen now I don't play the champ but it seems to me that the abilities that made him Shen were kept (Stand united and his taunt are both very iconic Shen abilities) and they changed his other abilities that honestly were pretty damn bland. His q and w were both abilities that had very little to them imo and I feel like Shen came out of that rework a more fun champion.\n\nI personally look forward to future reworks.. that being said I do hope they don't change what I like about them but from what I've seen so far they've been doing a pretty good job. I will say there are reworks that I feel aren't very good such as Ryze and Morde that come to mind instantly but they have been getting it right more often than not for me so I have high hopes.","replies":[{"poster":"Serika Zero","date":"2016-02-23T10:16:26.195+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":3,"body":"What people hate is \"loss of playstyles\".\nFor example.\nOriginal Fiora was a glass cannon melee AD with a single defensive spell (her ultimate) which had 1 minute cooldown.
