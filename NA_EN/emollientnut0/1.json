Never complained about a punishment, but this seems over the top.","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"To give a little context to this whole thing: \r\n\r\nI was in a bad car crash a little over a year ago, broke my hand and lost my job because of it. Has that made me more toxic in my matches? Undoubtedly and obviously yes, since I&#039;m at this point now. I&#039;ve said a lot of terrible things in this game, none of which I&#039;m proud of for both personal and in-game reasons. However getting an account permabanned was something I was never trying to accomplish, and this time coming back to the game I made pretty big strides turning my behavior around. The chat I posted below is night and day from how I normally react to people. \r\n\r\nI played 5 games. **5 games was apparently the time I was given to reform.**\r\n\r\nIn those 5 games I got reported for these chat logs, which ironically is probably some of the LEAST toxic things I&#039;ve ever said. In a couple matches I went as far as defending one of my teammates from the 2 flamers, after being called a &quot;blindass&quot; with the two of them nonstop complaining. As a matter of fact, right after that match ended I got the notification that one of them was punished. And still this is the last straw for my account?\r\n\r\nIn the second game I even tried to keep my team positive temporarily, even after my Jhin said 10 minutes in that he &quot;Doesn&#039;t feel like playing so let&#039;s just open.&quot; So (I think rightfully so) I try to keep him interested but since he doesn&#039;t want to play, I start getting frustrated myself and agree with his open, even though I continued playing anyway.\r\n\r\nI guess my question is, do any of you really find anything I said on the same level as Tyler1 ban worthy? For the most part my language was in check(The only swear I said was repeating back the one that was said to me), the only potentially harrassing statement was asking for the Shen or Jhin to be reported (Shen who nonstop flamed me for the entirety of the match past 10 minutes, and Jhin who &quot;Didn&#039;t feel like playing ranked&quot; 10 minutes in to starting a match), I tried to remain positive until my teammate gave up, and I didn&#039;t verbally attack anyone. Not to mention in all of those games I gave my best performance I think I could, so why so harsh on the ban, and why so quick?\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not here for a pity party. As I said I know I&#039;ve said a lot of terrible things to get to the point I&#039;m at now. But seriously, these 2 chat logs worth a permaban? I really don&#039;t get that being the line crossed as the &quot;last straw.&quot;\r\n\r\nI&#039;m sure a lot of you that read this will comment the stereotypical &quot;I&#039;m glad you&#039;re banned,&quot; and that&#039;s fine if that&#039;s your opinion. I also come from the school of thought that thinks reverse flaming in that way is equally as toxic, but to each their own.\r\n\r\nI never even got the email that comes with getting an account banned, leading me to be even more confused about the entire situation. I&#039;ve checked multiple email inboxes to hopefully get a little more light on this whole situation, and I got no such treatment.\r\n\r\nWell, feel free to comment any opinions you guys have, and good luck on your future matches and lives on the outside.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} \r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nEmollientNut0: Teemo&#039;s obviously the weak link\r\nEmollientNut0: oK\r\nEmollientNut0: No more top ganks\r\nEmollientNut0: Well this blindass isn&#039;t ganking at all anymore, have fun\r\nEmollientNut0: ok :)\r\nEmollientNut0: Sorry cant\r\nEmollientNut0: No more ganks\r\nEmollientNut0: You&#039;re the one calling your teammate bad, that&#039;s pretty childish :#\r\nEmollientNut0: Alright, I won&#039;t fight anymore then\r\nEmollientNut0: Just keep digging lower XD\r\nEmollientNut0: ^\r\nEmollientNut0: Don&#039;t worry jhin, I&#039;ll get them back :^)\r\nEmollientNut0: Which one is it?\r\nEmollientNut0: It&#039;s rare to have this many teammates so toxic\r\nEmollientNut0: I already told you what you guys earned from me xp\r\nEmollientNut0: You chose to waste this time, I&#039; told you what you earned :P\r\nEmollientNut0: Report Shen for trolling please\r\nEmollientNut0: Your choice again :P\r\nEmollientNut0: ^\r\nEmollientNut0: True that\r\nEmollientNut0: The lethality buff did a lot for him lol\r\nEmollientNut0: He&#039;s awesome\r\nEmollientNut0: I remember playing him in S4 thinking he&#039;d never be good XD\r\nEmollientNut0: I have my team muted, are they still flaming?\r\nEmollientNut0: Good game all\r\n\r\nGame 2\r\nEmollientNut0: Why would he do that\r\nEmollientNut0: He should go bulky mage\r\nEmollientNut0: As an old Kennen main that would hurt our comp a lot right now\r\nEmollientNut0: XD\r\nEmollientNut0: Seriously what&#039;s with toplaners not leashing today\r\nEmollientNut0: gee gee\r\nEmollientNut0: you too\r\nEmollientNut0: ^\r\nEmollientNut0: Tbh there&#039;s a chance I can carry this\r\nEmollientNut0: And I ususally don&#039;t have optimism witht hat\r\nEmollientNut0: Apparently neither does your support\r\nEmollientNut0: Was so sure you were gonna kill yourself on that lmao\r\nEmollientNut0: ff\r\nEmollientNut0: I&#039;m done\r\nEmollientNut0: No one&#039;s performing, we have no tank and no cc\r\nEmollientNut0: If Jhin couldn&#039;t beat a Lucian then we have some serious problems\r\nEmollientNut0: Yeah, I&#039;m opening\r\nEmollientNut0: No\r\nEmollientNut0: Something clearly was LOL\r\nEmollientNut0: Janna&#039;s a force multiplier\r\nEmollientNut0: Janna x 0 is still 0\r\nEmollientNut0: I&#039;m opening\r\nEmollientNut0: Said the 0/3 Kennen to the 10/4 Elise\r\nEmollientNut0: &quot;nothing\r\nEmollientNut0: &quot;\r\nEmollientNut0: Like you played this match so poorly that even listening to you is a mistake\r\nEmollientNut0: I said no\r\nEmollientNut0: Yeah go ahead and report jhin please\r\nEmollientNut0: You too for being toxic\r\nEmollientNut0: For playing ranked when you don&#039;t want to and opening at 10 minutes lol","replies":[{"poster":"jpguy902","date":"2017-02-16T02:42:02.654+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well its kinda just like being on probation.
