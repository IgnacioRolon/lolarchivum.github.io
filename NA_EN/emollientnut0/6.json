But that's not always possible given your role. Which is why I don't generally like playing glass cannons. \n\nThis habit, I tend to associate with noobs who do not know how to play safe. (either they don't know the capabilities of their/their opponent's champion. or don't understand proper positioning. ) Though if they are that far behind, your best bet would be to swap lanes with someone who is doing better.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2016-04-05T17:38:21.777+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because their premade buddies usually carry them in the end. Also, very low MMR solo players are sometimes teamed with very high MMR players to balance out the average MMR rating between teams, so when they get crushed 1v1 there's a decent chance they get carried.\n\nLike when a 1/8/2 Talon top rushed BOTRK in ranked yet won.
