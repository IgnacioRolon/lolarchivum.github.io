Sometimes it's just a bad day. Since you only play with the player in one game, you can't really tell if this is a person who deserves to be punished or not. Riot's Instant Feedback System on the other hand can tell if a person is really toxic or if he or she just had a bad day.\nIt's frustrating that everyone who is mean in-game isn't punished instantly (I really dislike mean people), but there's also the issue of players who think the system is draconian enough already and needs to be toned down. I definitely don't think it should be toned down, but we need to strike a balance between being too harsh and not being harsh enough.","replies":[{"poster":"Bloodhawk95","date":"2017-01-21T06:31:20.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand what you're saying, and can agree, to an extent.\n\nPretty sure if someone is wishing my mother to die of cancer and for me to get raped by a gang of people, they should be insta-banned.\n\nHaving a bad day is one thing, taking the time to think, and  say, an absolute horrible thing, is deserving of a temp-ban, regardless of player history.\n\nThat being said, ive had my fair share of bad days where i was extremely rude to other people, and at one point, caught myself a 2-week ban.
