Similar to the likes of Will Smith's \"Men In Black\", I think this skin is necessary. Lucian needs a better skin.\n\nLucian would have suppressed weapons. And be in a two piece suit similar to the Secret Agent Xin Zhao skin\n\nComment what you think, and throw out ideas for it. Like recall animation, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"nickstravaganza","date":"2015-03-17T18:33:40.881+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've wanted this for ages! I'm hoping the Xin Zhao skin opens the door for it. I'm not on the skins team, but I'd probably start with some secret agent movies for recall inspiration. OR I'd just make something that looks really cool when you do it next to secret agent Xin, with his calling-for-extraction style of recall.","replies":[{"poster":"Juryo","date":"2015-03-18T09:01:46.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the support!
