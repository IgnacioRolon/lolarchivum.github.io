I'd recommend sticking to the one where you've submitted the information that was requested in your initial ticket.  It's been escalated to a specialist who will look further into this.  Account security is very important, and we need to make sure that we're returning the account to its owner.  A specialist will assist you as soon as possible!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wolfess","date":"2016-08-31T10:33:25.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the best thing you can do is comply with their requests so that they can in turn help you recover your account. It may take a bit of time but they're the ones doing the job so the more you help them do it the better it will be for you.","replies":[]}]}
