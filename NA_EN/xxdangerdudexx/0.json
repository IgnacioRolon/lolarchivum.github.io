It sounds like something is corrupt with the update and causing it to crash.  If this is on the new client, a [reinstall ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends)should fix this up.  Otherwise, you can use the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to refresh the legacy client.
