I'm kinda new to the game and I just started downloading. However, I have one problem regarding the download. My download should be running at at least 10 MB (not Mb) per second. Currently my download is only running at 300 kbs. I've tried running other downloads for different games and apps, and none of them are going as slow. I've followed the connection guide, but no luck. However, this is the least of my concerns. At the current speed of the download, I noticed that closing the launcher will restart my download. I was wondering if it's possible to pause my download for when I shut down for the night or when I'm not using my PC?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-08T04:03:50.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, unfortunately, our client doesn't actually have a pause feature built in for downloads or updates. You'll need to let that finish up in one go if at all possible. About the slow download, it could be from how that connection is being routed instead of how good your connection is. If you can, try downloading with a hardwired ethernet connection to see if that bumps up that download speed at all.","replies":[]}]}
