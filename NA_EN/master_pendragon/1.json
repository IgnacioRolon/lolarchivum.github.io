As an iPhone user, I love the simplicity of its interfaces. However, I feel the general \"swiping\" of Apple products to be getting old. Of course, there are an abundance of other reasons besides \"simplicity,\" in favor of the iPhone 6 and Apple products in general. I feel that I should get a new phone, not just for an upgrade, but rather for new design, new handling, new experience, etc...\r\nI researched many sites, and I've come to the conclusion that the HTC One M8 could be a rather good phone as well. So, iPhone 6 or HTC One M8?\r\n\r\n**Here is information I've gathered so far on both devices including its PROs and CONs:**\r\n*Apple iPhone 6 vs HTC One M8*\r\n- The HTC One M8 has an aluminum and more sleeker design than the iPhone 6.\r\n- The iPhone 6 is lighter than the HTC One M8.\r\n- The HTC One M8 has a taller display.\r\n- The HTC One M8 has a boom-sound speaker making the iPhone 6's speakers inferior.\r\n- The iPhone 6 (as well as older models) still possess the conveniently placed silent switch. Does the HTC One M8 possess such a process?\r\n- In comparison to older models, the iPhone 6 is by far the fastest phone ever made. When compared to the HTC One M8, there is not much of a difference.\r\n- The iPhone 6 possess a greater amount of Wi-Fi range and sticks with it as oppossed to the HTC One M8.\r\n- Due to its 6 month time gap, the HTC One M8's battery tends to very slightly drain more than the iPhone 6.\r\n- The iPhone 6 still possesses limited customization options as opposed to the HTC One M8.\r\n\r\n**SO!** Which do you think is a better option to get as, not just an upgrade, but a completely new experience? Is it the iPhone 6 because of its fast speed and now-improved high quality?; or, is it the HTC One M8 because of its sleeker design, interfaces, or a completely different OS? MAYBE, I missed something? MAYBE, there's a completely different phone I could be using instead of both the iPhone 6 and HTC One M8? Let me know what you guys think! I'd like to hear people's opinion and matter on this!","replies":[]}
