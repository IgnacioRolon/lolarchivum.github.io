Miss Fortune has no clear item paths due to obscure scaling.\n2. Miss Fortune is a low mobility ADC with no escapes.\n3. Miss Fortune is a teamfighter who cannot deal the correct level of damage \n    in the crucial early phase of the fight.\n\nTo expand on this.Miss Fortune gets increase magic damage from AD scaling,\nvia impure shots, which is a nice little version of mixed damage,but the damage is too\nlow to make any actual difference. Her ult scales with AP for no understandable reason.\n\nA passive of a free pair of mobi boots is terrible on an ADC, since the moment she \ngets hit,she gets slowed, and with no escapes and self peel limited to one weak slow,\nshe is too easily closed on and killed. The sole consolation is the grievous wounds\nallowing her to duel enemies other adcs would be killed by. But now thats gone.\n\nFinally, her ult deals nowhere near enough damage for the difficulty of landing it.\nCurse of the Sad Bullet Time is no longer a thing, as even low elo players know to spread\nout against tank engages, and a 1400 range spell is no longer \"long range\". Even if \nyou do get it to hit, it deals pitiful damage compared to two seconds of Crit auto \nattacks from other adcs.\n\nMiss Fortune could have been easily upgraded into a modern ADC with some simple \nchanges.\n\n1.  The magic damage from impure shots, both on auto attacks and ult benefit from\n    crit chance the same way ashe does. This rewards following standard ADC build \n    paths of AD/AS/Crit, rather than having to attempt to stack AD/MPen/PPen in some\n    oddball combo.\n\n2. Miss Fortune should be rewarded for standing and fighting instead of running away.\n    Her Passive is to set her up for the fight, then she stands there and blasts you away.\n   Grievous wounds on the impure shots active helped, but placing more utility into make\n    it rain,such as a hybrid shred of some sorts would definitely help her go toe to toe with\n    people who manage to dive through to her.\n\n3. Others have said that the number of Bullet Time waves should increase with As, but thats\n     lucians gig. A simple base value buff and AD scaling would be enough, when combined \n    with the hybrid shred of make it rain and the crit chance scaling of impure shots.\n    It is difficult to get two seconds of uninterrupted channel, at only 1400 range (to the \n     backline),as an ADC. It should be rewarded.\n\nMiss Fortunes game-play identity is completely anchored in the big teamfight.Unlike other \nteamfight ADCs such as Graves or Varus, Miss Fortune is not mobile, is not bursty,and is not \nfocused on control. She is a widespread engine of destruction, who stands there and and \nblasts away. If you close on her, she has the tools to fight you, and if you run, her passive\nshould help her chase you down.\n\nWhile the new VFX are nice, the mechanical changes do not help modernise this old champion.","replies":[{"poster":"UPfreely","date":"2015-07-08T18:23:16.806+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":7,"body":"Bait title makes no mention of the actual nerfs.

With that parallel drawn, why on Earth would it NOT deactivate from a minion hitting her? At least now she needs to take \"direct, non-periodic damage\" for it to fall off, rather than any damage at all.

Yet we're whining about a status ailment?\n\nLike, they basically buffed her fleeing/chasing as well as her in-lane bullying, but we're now whining over a status ailment being shaved in order to buff that in-lane bullying?

Miss Fortune is a low mobility ADC with no escapes.\n\nand she makes up for it with a really strong laningphase, good gloabl mobility and massive dmg-potential in teamfights + the ability to retrigger strut infight will give her access to quite some mobility\n\n>3.

It's not really a strength but something you end up working around. I actually like Fortune as a hybrid damage dealer, but personal preference aside, a hybrid ADC is at a disadvantage.\n\nI guess you are basing the stronger laning phase purely on her ability to return to lane faster than other ADC. I don't think this mobility will ever allow her to get a whole creep wave ahead of her competition unless she is flat out better at last hitting.\n\nAlso the passive of strut is only a boost of 25 that builds to 70 over 5 seconds. Being able to reactivate strut will be canceled out with a quick AA from a minion or Champion long before it reaches its Max. Enjoy your free pair of boots for about 1 second.\n\nHonestly, the ability to chase and escape is what Fortune really lacks. I don't worry about the whole \"make her like every other ADC\", since I feel the hybrid nature coincides with her Impure Shots.\n\nI do agree that Fortune doesn't seem to do enough hybrid damage. A Fortune with Gunblade and Cleaver should decimate a stunned enemy team. Of course, they have to be stunned or they will just walk out of range. Which Fortune doesn't have a stun. She does have a slow, which I hear is being buffed, so maybe a Make it Rain/Bullet Time combo will be more viable than it has been in the past. As is, it seems starting with Rain is just an invitation for a gap closer/stun and no Bullet Time for you. There's just so much perfect positioning required for Fortune.\n\nAs for any ideas on changing her... I think her passive needs to be reversed. After taking damage, Fortune gains 70MS which reduces by 35 when out of combat for more than 3 seconds which decreases another 35 over the next 3 seconds. Everything else can stay the same till we see how that changed passive works out.","replies":[{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2015-07-08T16:22:33.228+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":">I guess you are basing the stronger laning phase purely on her ability to return to lane faster than other ADC.

Missing the bounce on a champion and instead hardpushing your lane by oneshotting a caster minion feels bad man, especially when the champion and the minion in question were right next to each other and both are completely viable targets. RNG SUCKS.\n\nW needs to PROTECT strut for the duration of the AS steroid (pls rito, being able to instantly have 70 stacks is nice but it would be better this waaaaay)\n\nR needs an AD ratio (IT CAN BE LOW PER SHOT EVEN! PLS RITO!)\n\nIf MF gets ahead in her lane, she can dominate fights without many changes due to the level reliant nature of her ultimate's damage and scaling.
