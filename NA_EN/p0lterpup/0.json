So just live with it.\n\nEventually, sure.  I just wish that this team would just drop all the excuses and false \"for the players\" pretenses and admit that they make skins based on what they think will sell and little else.  They'll throw a bone for the \"niche\" champs here and there, but only put their focus and best efforts on the ones that could make money for Riot and Tencent.\n\nSo, no.  I won't \"just live with it.\"  :)  \n \n> You DON&#x27;T know what is happening or what isn&#x27;t cause again that&#x27;s not all the skins they have in production.\n\nTo be blunt, neither do you.  All you have a cheeky little comment  _\"She did say they might get some others in there that she didn't mention.\"_\n\nHowever, I have seven years of experience interacting with a department that learned to not make promises they don't intend to keep.  Hell, you were the one who proved that there were no other neglected champs that received skins in 2017 that weren't mentioned in the last Dev Blog during our previous conversation!\n\nIf this team WAS going to deliver on an Urgot skin in 2018, they'd have announced it in the video.  Since they didn't, they're not.  History is more on my side in this case.\n\nThen again, If you want to have _faith_, please do so and don't let me stop you.  When it comes to Riot Games, I find that path leads to madness.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2018-03-13T23:09:04.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"*yawn*\n\n>If this team WAS going to deliver on an Urgot skin in 2018, they'd have announced it in the video.

They do NOT always announce the upcoming skins they have for champions as they pretty much never have. The only things they put on the list were those that were needing skins (a lot of which the community had been begging for). It's the same with the previous list  Viktor, Illaoi, Yorick and Cassio were all champions that people had badly wanted skins for since Viktor and Cassio hadn't seen them in years, Illaoi hadn't gotten anything since the day of her release and Yorick was a recently VGU champion.\n\nThe current list has champions like A. Sol cause he was released in 2016 and hasn't seen a single thing since then.   Others like Heimerdinger, Vlad, Shen are those that have had people wanting something new for several years as they are fairly popluar champions. \n\nUrgot is old and should have a skin, yes, but he was also a previously underplayed champion until having been given a VGU 8 months ago.  He only became popular after that, but even that still doesn't mean we'll see tons of skins since a 6 legged creature isn't gonna be the easiest thing to slap a skin on.  He has 3 skins, so yes, he's low on them but one is still 1350 and is a great quality plus his others were given extra bits for the update and hold more quality than previous 520s.\n\nThey didn't say Eve there either, but I feel she will see one sometime this year as it's been pretty clear with their recent VGUs of champions such as Fiora, Poppy, Taric, Warwick, that they want to get new skins to them ASAP.  The longest one was Sion, that happened about a year and a half after the update.  At the same time they don't want to rush them, or its gonna be something that is completely worthless.","replies":[{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2018-03-14T00:14:06.020+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sukishoo,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=QXZydMl1,comment-id=0003000200000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-03-13T23:09:04.554+0000)\n>\n> *yawn*\n\nYou act bored, yet you continue to respond... Odd...\n\n> Edited for space\n\n* The history lesson was pointless, at best.  \n\n\n* You mention \"popularity\" a lot, something the skins team has claimed doesn't matter to them.  Are you saying that popularity _does_ matter and that their claims to the contrary are false?\n\n\n* The justifications for Urgot not getting a skin this year would be consistent with Riot's statements in the past, if not for Dragon Master Swain being released super early (which was just to kill the meme).  Therefore, they no longer hold water.  IF the team wanted to make an Urgot skin quickly, they seem more than capable of doing so given what I've seen.\n\n\n* You \"feel\" that Eve will get a new skin this year?  Based on what?  She wasn't mentioned in the video, like you said, yet you choose to believe?  If all you have is faith to justify your conclusions, so be it.  I've been down that path and it's been nothing but disappointment and frustration.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2018-03-14T01:30:41.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":">You mention \"popularity\" a lot, something the skins team has claimed doesn't matter to them.

So you clearly don't know much at all about how they really work.    Like why do you think Lux got a Skin for Lunar Reveal? It's cause she's popular.  Over due champion, like Galio, gets a skin for April Fools day but he's not as popular so don't expect to see another skin for him for a few years.  Where as , Lux may have just gotten one, but she will still have a good chance at getting another sooner than Galio.\n\nIt's all about what sells.  They aren't gonna rush a skin for Urgot vs the other champions they listed that are also overdue, cause they are more wanted.\n\n>You \"feel\" that Eve will get a new skin this year?  EDITED CAUSE NONSENSE.\n\nI already said why.
