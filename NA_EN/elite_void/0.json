The thing is that the last movement takes precedense and since ezreal and tristana movement is delayed they can easily be set up to happen after you have begun being pulled by blitzcrank.\n\nYou can also use alistar headbutting an enemy away after it has been hooked by blitzcrank to replicate it.\n\nThere are a lot of hard cases to since most dashses and blinks have a 0.25 cast time but these are hard since they have to be cast before you get stunned by the hook and go off after you start being pulled","replies":[{"poster":"maikokk","date":"2015-07-21T20:25:03.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow. thank you. i do a ton of research on mechanics and i have never seen anything about this. uber grateful to have learned this.","replies":[{"poster":"LongHair Fox","date":"2015-07-21T21:25:35.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are some funny cases such as thresh hook counting as three seperate pulls so reply to me here if you want to know about any ambiguous cases.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2015-07-20T21:51:53.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not even close.\n\nEzreal's E doesn't have a cast time, but a lengthy animation (same with his R).\nNothing you can do will stop Ezreal from blinking, except death, because animations aren't cancelable.\n\nOn the other hand Flash is instant.
