Go ahead and reach out to our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they might be able to give a little more info as to what the problem is at that point, but ultimately it looks like this issue lies with you ISP.","replies":[{"poster":"invaled","date":"2017-07-19T16:13:13.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I'm sending the support guy at riot some more info he requested.
