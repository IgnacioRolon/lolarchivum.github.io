I didn't give it much attention but today when i tried to play again, i had the same issue! Unfortunately i deleted LoL in order to reinstall it, only  now that i install it again it doesnt launch!!! Please help me, this is so frustrating, it just happened like that and i can't use any of the fixes i found online since they require the game to be installed. :(","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2017-08-24T17:23:31.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I have a pretty good idea as to why this is happening:  When you launch an already installed client or try to launch it for the first time after installing, your computer Operating System needs to give permission to League to properly launch and patch itself.  If it doesn't give these permissions, you'll encounter issues exactly as you have described.  The best way to solve this is to follow our [Permissions Guide.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104)  Some of the steps may seem really simple, but they are crucial in hopefully resolving this issue.\n\nIf the problem persists, reply back and let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Mediclean","date":"2017-08-24T18:00:01.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will try it and let you know.
