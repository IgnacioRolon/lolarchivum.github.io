Like someone pointed out, even if Ashe doesn't have gapclosers she can slow really well, so if she had 350 movement speed there'd be no escape. Someone like Kog, however, I feel could use a little love.","replies":[{"poster":"DEmperor95","date":"2015-02-08T08:10:27.154+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kog actually received a nerf in 4.14 to reduce his MS from 330 to 325.

She is kinda a victim of her own success in that without her and nunu in the game the mobility creep would have not happened in the way it did.\n\nAs for lee sin and Zed no one is really defending them currently but in the case you gave of lee chasing down kog you disregard the slow  kog has in his kit as well as that champions should have inherent weaknesses.
