That means either they get ultimates that do strong stuff or ultimates that get strong damage, Ultimates may be allowed to have some really big stuff, but if they get to do way too much then they are extremely broken, which in a proper 'balanced world' would mean they'd have to suck some of the power out of the overall kit to get away with how strong they can be.\n\nReksai's new ultimate works more of a anti-runner measure which means she is going to be pretty useful to chase after champions like \n{{champion:4}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:98}} and of course, {{champion:56}} when they use their own ultimates more as escape measures instead of what they are 'supposed' to be used as. Especially scummy little {{champion:245}} escapes which i still believe his R still needs some more limits like a 'cap' on how much % health he can recover from the thing so its more like he only recovers up to 30% max health instead of being able to gain a full health bar from 20%~40% to 100% with ease.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} \n\nSquishie or not, being basically an 'assassin' with a insta full heal button is more ridiculous then a Soraka who can spam her R every 5 seconds.\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2017-06-01T13:10:59.478+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Unlike Nocture's ult, it has a low cooldown.
