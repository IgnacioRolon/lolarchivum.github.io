Taliyah story also states she was was born in the foothills of Icathia further indicating a mountain near it.\n\n##Icathia&#039;s Origins\nAntlantis comes to mind when talking about a lost city, which is often a term that connects to very powerful and magical places. \nIcathia was heavily inspired by H.P. Lovecraft&rsquo;s tale about a city called Iram of the pillars, which was based on the tale One Thousand and One Nights. Lovecraft&#039;s story features an author that finds the lost city and writes a book about dark magic the so-called ~~Morello~~Necronomicon. This character was also the inspiration for our favorite void prophet Malzahar.\nThe author described the city as huge with lofty pillars and with a paradise garden, probably alluding to the hanging gardens of Babylon which also implies that it was an oasis.\nThe author also describes the city to be carved into a mountain, which further indicates that Icathia was at a mountain range.\n\nI still wonder who the people of the Icathia were and if they really meddled with dark magic, before the void came to the city. \nHowever the city seemed to be at war with Shurima at least once, and probably was defeated due to the fact that Renekton took the weapon of an Icathain warrior King.\n\n***\n\n##Related Champions\n\nThere are several champions and characters that are connected to Icathia. However, some of the lore is severely outdated.\n\n* Tyrus &ndash; The teacher of Ryze and the reason for Icathia&rsquo;s demise by using 2 world runes.\n* Kassadin &ndash; was probably and explorer of some kind and was imbued with voidish power upon finding the city\n* Malzahar &ndash; being called by higher power he was the first to discover Icathia and left though he succumbed to the void&rsquo;s power and now serve&rsquo;s it\n* Jax &ndash; was living in Icathia when it was still a peaceful city, however his appearance seems  to be altered by the influences of the void.\n* Taliyah &ndash; was born near Icathia\n* Voidborn - All voidborn champions probably entered Valoran through a portal in Icathia. Special to mention that Kog&rsquo;Maw was brought by Malzahar personally, and Vel&rsquo;Koz probably created a portal on his own, as his story starts in Urtistan.\n* The entity - A monstrous and powerful intelligent being that also called Malzahar\n \n  * (Ryze) &ndash; came there to find his old master, killed him there and took the 2 runes from his possession, and also is a protector of valoran \n\n***\n##Theory\nBefore I come to the several Champions listed above I wanted to show you the base of a lot of my speculations in the following texts. An explanation why the void is so present in Icathia.\n\nThe Universe article of the Void also states that it consumes biomass, as if it were a sentient being.\n\nOne idea was that either the teased entity corrupts, consumes, converts or whatever you want to call it, everything through void portals/rifts.\nHowever in the case of Icathia a different theory one seemed more logical to me. \nSince the World Runes are said to be the tools that created Runeterra there could also exist Void Runes, who were the creation tools for the void. \n\nThis is the void icon https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/d/db/Void_Crest_icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20161117174852\n\nAs you might have noticed the void has a few connections:\n\n* Malzahar&rsquo;s Voidlings eyes and his new hoodie\n* Vel&rsquo;Koz number of tentacles and passive stacks above\n* Both crests\n* Kha&rsquo;Zix evolutions\n\nThe void has a lot to do with the number ~~four~~3 (sorry Jhin mains). Which led me to a part where I missed this number, and that was when Ryze found Tyrus after he destroyed the city with **2 runes**.\n\nHere comes the question:  \n#What if Icathia had 3 world runes?\n\nRunic power or the existence of a Void Rune(or void corrupted World Rune) could explain a lot that happened around Icathia.\nAlso this is the **Icathian crest:** https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/9/98/Icathia_Crest.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140705084628\nand hit me if I&#039;m wrong but to me it looks like the crest contains of three runes\n\nFor example:\n\n* The corruption of Malzahar through a rune\n* The mutation of Jax through constant exposure to their magical power.\n* The powers of Taliyah that was born near the city.\n* Kassadin&rsquo;s passive void stone might be a rune\n* Tyrus previous intnt to protect by using the runes against the Void or a corrupted Malzahar.\n* The thriving life without water in the middle of a desert\n\n\n***\n\n##Jax{{champion:24}} \nAs far as the lore updates go Jax is the only konwn individual from Icathia that is still alive. The cataclysm might have mutated him after he survived it, or he might have transformed before and that was the reason he survived in the first place. \nOr he could have left because he was transformed, even before the incident.\nThe mutation increased his lifespan considerably but did not grant him magical powers as the void did to Malzahar and Kassadin\n\n*&ldquo;Jax sighed; to see a realm at peace made him homesick for a land that no longer existed. He shook off the chill of memory, knowing thoughts of Icathia would only distract him.&rdquo;*\n\n***\n\n## Malzahar {{champion:90}} \nMalzahar&rsquo;s first interaction with a Champion in ages is with Ryze who can taunt him:\n\n*&quot;Hey, you&#039;re the one who summons bloodthirsty Void creatures, right? Yeah, brilliant work, good thinking.&quot;*\n\nHe doesn&rsquo;t say anything lore related, but it seems he dislikes Malzahar for obvious reasons, maybe even especially for being from Icathia. \nIt&#039;s just a theory but since Icathia is a city in the Shuriman desert I thought it would belong to the empire all along. making Malzahar a possible inhabitant. \n\nAnyhow, Malzahar was born a seer not a mage. That means he was probably aware of magical energy and could see into the future by channeling this energy, which  probably made him susceptible to greater powers especially void energy.\nI think the entity could have corrupted him but if his powers would come from a world rune which corrupted him seemed more likely to me.\n\n***\n\n##Kassadin{{champion:38}} \nProbably an explorer or seeker of knowledge Kassadin searched through books and all possible history he could find and came to Icathia in his lore, but it never is specified how he resisted the Void. \nMaybe Kassadin was a powerful mage already and sealed void power in a stone (Passive: Void Stone) so he could use it to protect.\nI would also suspect that he is from Icathian origin as all 3 Champs seem to cover their face, probably because they mutated somehow.\n\n***\n\n##Taliyah{{champion:163}} \nBorn in the shadows of the city and raised around the lands of Icathia the remains of runic power might have awoken the special magic that resides in Taliyah.\nAs it seems Icathia always is connected with magic even after the city&#039;s downfall\n\n#The Entity\n## and the Voidborn{{champion:31}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:421}} \n\nAll voidborn besides Vel&#039;Koz (who presumably entered near Urtistan) are said to come from Icathia through a portal and also all Void-influenced ones received there power there.\n\nBut let&#039;s get to talk about the entity shortly. Aurelion Sol&#039;s the only champion that ever made contact with the entity through a rift and his description is quite interesting.\n\n&gt;a will... hungry and indomitable, and far from the typical mindlessness I&#039;m accustomed to from these Voidborn aberrations. The pulsating wound on reality yawns and buckles, distorting and warping all it touches. Whatever exists on the other side is laughing. [...]\nThis anomalous fissure in the universe entrances me. This is not the first of its kind I&#039;ve had to deal with, but this one feels different, and I can&#039;t help but admire the marvelously terrifying manipulation of the barriers between realms. Few beings could fathom its complexities, let alone possess the sheer magnitude of power needed to rend the fabric of existence. In my heart, I know a wound so exquisite could never be orchestrated by scuttling creatures. No. There must be more behind this intrusion. I shudder at the thought of what kind of entity is capable of inducing such a volatile rift.\n\nThis gives us a glimpse of the amount of power it takes to create a rift between dimensions so that even a celestial dragon is entranced by it.\n\nThe entity is probably the ruler of all voidborn commanding all those being sent directly to runeterra.\n \nEven though a voidborn command chain is not steady at all, because some can steadily (Kha&#039;Zix) I suspect that the voidborn are similar to insectoid life forms are therefore have a command structure similar to bees, as seen with the release of Rek&#039;Sai. That could mean that there are probably more races with leaders like Rek&#039;Sai.\n\nHowever even if each race has its leader there sems to be a kind of ranking system between races; though only 2 can be ranked above the others until now because of their powers/behaviour.  \n\nVel&#039;Koz might be allowed to kill other voidborn, or at least doesn&#039;t care about them, which implies he is higher in rank than others. Also he is able to open portals and rifts which (as quoted above) is quite the formidable task, making him higher ranked as other voidborn.\n\nEven though Malzahar is not a Voidborn he seems to be the only Void-related Champ to summon other void creatures through a portal and who really controls beings of the void (e.g Kog&#039;Maw and his Voidlings) ranking him possibly even higher or at least similar to Vel&#039;Koz.\n\n\nAmongst voidborn also seems to be a differentiation between non-intelligent life forms and intelligent life forms:\n \nVel&#039;Koz is probably the most intelligent one, as he for one has the most evolved speach pattern and communicates telepathically, and actually seeks knowledge Rek&#039;Sai is probably the least intelligent one with a primitive sense for hunting and no knowledge of speach at all.\n\n>* Primitive Voidborn: Zz&#039;Rot, Voidlings, Rift Herald, Baron Nashor, Rek&#039;Sai/Xer&#039;Sai Race, Pre-Runeterra Kha&#039;Zix and even possibly Kog&#039;Maw. \n* Intelligent Voidborn: The entity, Vel&#039;Koz, Cho&#039;Gath, Kha&#039;Zix nowadays \n\n\nThat&#039;s it for now this seems to be all I could find and wanted to write about.\nIf you have questions ask me anything you&#039;d like and if you want to flame me that&#039;s allright I guess, this is my first post like this after all.\n\nThanks for reading at least a bit and have a weird and dark day in the void &hearts;","replies":[{"poster":"SteelMankind","date":"2017-05-06T18:29:16.004+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"A void event would be pretty dope.

Magic disaster happened and void found a way into town, jax is a known survivor who´s undergone mutations there.  \n\nCity of mages doing some experiment? Perhaps a Ley line or some other thing nearby which also causes people born in the area to posses greater gifts for magic or just enhances them.  Would explain Taliyah and her clan of earth seers and mages.  Maybe how the voids \"voice\" was heard by malz who was far away, the \"whispers\" carried by magic streams that he was tapping into for visions. \n\nSo maybe a rune blew up or got sucked into a void hole resulting in a unstable but permanent gateway into the void, the result is a high ratio of void energy and an actual gateway opening into random places inside the void randomly. This would explain why 4 different kinds of creatures have come through instead of 4 similar ones. \n\nRyze's teacher was involved and Ryze got a pretty firm idea that tampering with runes was a terrible idea from it, city being decimated by evil demon like thingies would fit the description of \"something bad\".\n\n\nWhatever Aurelion encountered in the valley he found when Targon was trying to boss him around is kinda unknown except that it is powerful and it needs a huge ass rift before it can pass through. \n\nOn that note, Targon and the void are at war with the void winning, this seen from the lunar targon and several others being directly wiped out by them, this is weakening the seals on Aurelion who also happens to be only one who packs enough of a punch to smash a void invasion head on.

Perhaps that's intentional?**\n","replies":[{"poster":"Onkel Malte","date":"2017-05-07T07:53:04.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Velk'koz and Malzahar have great potential for color texts.\nVelk'koz bio and teaser were incredibly awesome and I suspect more like this to come.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"dapositiveviking","date":"2017-05-06T19:24:48.945+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"the third world rune is the light in jax's lamp","replies":[]},{"poster":"Otarie53","date":"2017-05-06T23:21:29.946+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i think vel'koz is a rogue voidborn in a quest for personal power. he doesn't seem like he wants to bring whatever he learns back to the entity after disintegrating zilean.","replies":[{"poster":"Onkel Malte","date":"2017-05-07T07:54:24.052+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That could be for sure, but since I suspect the entity is capable of enslaving them and since Vel is a researcher I think he got some freedoms that other voidlings don't have.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-05-07T01:00:29.140+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really hope kassadin remains as a brigand that got transformed against his will.","replies":[{"poster":"Onkel Malte","date":"2017-05-07T07:58:04.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definetly!
