We are looking for disciplined and punctual players who take the game seriously and who want to improve. Experience in competitive 5s is highly preferred but not required.\r\n\r\nOur players so far excel at early game consistency, and mid-late game teamfight dominance and thus we are looking for players who can compliment this playstyle. If you consider yourself a calculating team player who has an excellent teamfight, we are probably the team for you. If you can only play the role of a solo carry or you find you tend to go too aggressive more often than not, I&#039;m still open to giving you a tryout because I don&#039;t like to judge a book by its cover but you&#039;re probably not what we&#039;re looking for.\r\n\r\nWe already have Mid and Support taken, and we have a third member who can fill one of the remaining three roles. Here are the requirements for people trying out for Top, Jungle, or ADC (we only need 2 of these roles).\r\n\r\n\r\n__________________________\r\n__________________________\r\nTop requirements (no exceptions):\r\n\r\n* Exceptional teamfight ability\r\n* Experience in and willingness to play any 3 bruisers and 1 tank out of the following champions: Camille, Kled, Irelia, Gnar, Shen, Ornn, Sion\r\n* Ability to draw jungle pressure and have a high gank survival rate\r\n* Good wave control and decent laning ability\r\n* Under D5 for both S7 and S8\r\n* A controlled playstyle (Mainly just don&#039;t get tunnel vision and go too aggressive)\r\n* Be able to respond to splitpush attempts quickly\r\n\r\n_____________________________\r\nJungler requirements (no exceptions):\r\n\r\n* Exceptional teamfighting ability\r\n* Experience in and willingness to play: Sej, Zac, J4.
