I feel like it has something to do with the overemphasis on early game, making cheese strats lose their counterplay of &quot;just play safe and outscale&quot; since the game ends so quickly nowadays. The ADC items delaying powerspikes from most ADC&#039;s was the final nail in the coffin. What does everyone else think? I&#039;d love to hear your thoughts below!","replies":[{"poster":"BlueBilberry","date":"2018-06-13T22:31:36.620+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's the emphasis on early game snowballing.  Get ahead the hard carry jungler in gold, farm and scuttles and be ready to 1 (or 2) versus 5 the other team.  The nerfs to adcs and supports have only meant that supports (or support-related champs) move to mid to help the junglers.  \n\nAs for botlane, its near future nature remains to be seen.  But things don't look good or clear for the players who get assigned to the bottom - having to deal with a jungler-carry which is three levels up by the first team fight is not a pleasant thing to deal with.  For those left behind by the meta shift, mages and crit-based adcs are not in the best position right now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2018-06-13T22:36:05.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlawsF2A9XE\n\nThat is part of why things are so crazy right now.","replies":[]}]}
