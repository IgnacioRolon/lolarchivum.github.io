Can we show some love to our scaling champions? I have two thoughts of how to address this. If his W base damage got buffed a bit as it was maxed, it would help him through his mid game struggles so that he won&#039;t feel so weak and useless when the game is at its most critical point. Alternatively, his mana costs could be lowered a bit so that he can abuse his poke power in lane better. This way he can have a better fighting chance to earn a big enough lead to mitigate his weak mid game, rewarding players who play lane well by giving them more opportunities to punish their opponents early on with poke. I&#039;ll be the first to admit my bias as a frequent Azir player, but he feels unplayably weak right now in solo queue and I think he deserves a little bit of love.","replies":[]}
