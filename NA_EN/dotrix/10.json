I don&#039;t think that my favorite champion, Viktor, has had over a 50% overall winrate (possibly not even above 47%) on OP.GG and his recent buffs don&#039;t seem to have addressed his main issues (requiring too many items and taking too long to come online). Before I start complaining on the forums asking for buffs though, I want to make sure that there haven&#039;t been any Viktor playstyles/builds that I may not have seen that are actually more viable.\r\n\r\nBefore the new runes, I was at least able to abuse deathfire touch with my ability to poke constantly and I maintained about a high 60 to low 70% winrate on Viktor across all games (normals, scrims, and ranked included). The usual hex core into lichbane combination just doesn&#039;t seem to cut it no matter what new rune page I take now though. I feel like unless I get a sizable lead, I&#039;m typically needing 3-4 items to actually start making a true impact, but games aren&#039;t going on for that long every time.\r\n\r\nViktor feels even more team reliant than he ever has been, especially with the delay on the second part of his E being so long that it relies more on the opponent screwing up than your actual skill and ability to hit it (a change that I cringed at even though I wasn&#039;t actively playing League when they implemented the Viktor rework). I&#039;m almost considering maxing my Q considering how much power Riot has siphoned away (no pun intended) from my E to shove into it. Does anybody have any interesting builds/rune pages that actually address his issue of taking too long to come online and become relevant?","replies":[{"poster":"Tabouli","date":"2018-02-23T01:56:13.850+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been trying to pick up Viktor as of late as a new midlaner to play when my friends and I are just screwing around. Ultimately I dont find his kit that underwhelming. What I find completely underwhelming is his upgrade process costing so much to upgrade with nothing to build into. If you dont grab his upgrade for e early you are screwed when it comes to pushing lane, and aery + q only gives so much trade potential when you cant even clear half a wave without the e upgrade.\n\nAs for landing your e on your opponent there are a few things I've noticed. 1) Placing your w on your opponent is a guaranteed e. 2) It is not really meant as your primary trade for dealing damage to your opponent and should be used in optimal positioning or just clearing waves to allow safe q trades. 3) I have noticed a lot of builds are starting to add Iceborn Gauntlet, with your q poke it makes it easier to trade with your e. However this runs into the same issue as you have stated that it wont be a viable as and option till at least your fourth item.\n\nUltimately I dont think Viktor has a kit problem, I think he has an itemization problem. As long as he has to build expensive early upgrades to augment his abilities he will continue to struggle.","replies":[]}]}
