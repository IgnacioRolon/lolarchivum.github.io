Aoe damage, medium ranged.\r\n\r\nW - Sorry tank annie, but this has to go. No reason a burst mage should be building tank. Her W now stores charges that are gained when she hits enemies with her Q/E. At 4 charges, she can activate W to release a fire wave around her dealing damage to enemies. Affected enemies take increased damage from her abilities for 5 seconds.\r\n\r\nE - Keep short ranged E. This forces her to go into enemy territory to gain stacks on W.\r\n\r\nR - This is now a skillshot, where she throws tibbers into combat. If she has stacks on W fully charged, tibbers immediately depletes those charges when he&#039;s spawned and the fire wave emits from him instead of Annie.\r\n\r\nNew Passive: Annie&#039;s bonus AP gives her extra mana based on (---insert appropriate calculations here---). This makes up for the mana on Q return she used to have, while not making her a free spam Q last hit champ.\r\nAA change: Tidy up attack animation annie has to allow her to cs a bit better in lane. Picture something smooth like Ori&#039;s aa animation. Don&#039;t know what it is, but annie&#039;s aa animation feels a tad too slow.\r\n\r\nPlayer who inspired idea/is trying to get attention on Annie needing a rework: https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/5z9nq9/youve_heard_it_before_and_youll_hear_it_again/\r\n\r\n\r\n* Feel free to suggest/change away ideas\r\n* Thought of keeping stun in her kit, but I don&#039;t know about it to be perfectly honest. Aoe stun on W sounded pretty insane. Probably on other spells?","replies":[{"poster":"qqpp","date":"2017-03-14T04:24:45.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her E was the tank steroid and her W was the short range AOE cone.

Other than that, the casting of her Q and ult sound pretty similar which can be boring in one kit, and I really think she needs her stun in some form.","replies":[]}]}
