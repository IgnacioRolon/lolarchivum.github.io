A simple solution to fixing this error is closing the sound card driver completely by going into the task bar and right clicking the Sonic Studio icon and clicking close. Your alpha client should now work normally. I have tested this to make sure that it this error is caused strictly from having this program open by testing it with a combination of different programs.\n\nBefore anyone asks yes, I have already submitted this to the Report A Bug form, this is just in case someone else is having this issue and wanted to know how to fix it before a patch was sent out.\n\n**TL;DR** Close the Sonic Studio 2 application and the Batch 5 error disappears and the alpha client now works perfectly.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Codebear","date":"2016-10-21T00:49:06.498+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, to quote one of our super grateful engineers: \"You are a {insert exciting adjective} saint!!!!!\"\n\nSecond off, this actually was super helpful and we really appreciating you digging into this so fast!
