You have 5 players not enjoying the game every single game this champion is played. In the first case it's the opponents playing against it, and in the second case it's the guy playing it + his team who are effectively in a 4v5.\n\nI honestly feel like Riot's design team doesn't think about this concept anymore.

This I think is a major reason why communication between Riot and the playerbase feels so spotty at times, and it's all the more unfortunate that it makes some players direct blame at individual Rioters, who really are doing the best they can.

They have internal testing, they have pbe testing, they have common sense, yet, galio, and many other ie ardent, mistakes keep happening. If these level of mistakes kept happening at my agency then they would be relieved of a job. You grow up. Realized that continually making giant mistakes it not acceptable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jjcool99","date":"2017-10-26T20:40:14.901+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":5,"body":"reinforcing bad behavior of the balance team says it ok not to test stuff before shipping busted stuff to live.\nsomeone does need to be removed from balance team and retrained before being allowed to continue.\nlets be honest they have done a lot of silly things lately and every other company would have 100% have fired any employee for it by now.\npeople would act a little different if they actually hot fixed it like they should have or fixed ardent instead of letting it define 3 months of game play and worlds.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowParker","date":"2017-10-26T20:47:38.979+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":20,"body":"You really don't understand how hard it is to balance a game like this do you?\n\nMess ups happen.

A couple stray posts perhaps inside other threads, but fairly rare, and not upvote fests. Mostly I've seen a bunch of threads going \"holy hell how did this go live?!\" and I think that's absolutely deserved. One thread calling for firing doesn't warrant a whole other thread telling people to chill about it.\n\nI knew the Galio changes weren't ok by just reading them. I saw it first hand clear as day on the first game I saw it in action, and I was the one playing it. It felt extremely unfair and overpowered by mid game. Every game I've seen Galio since then has shown it to be disgustingly obviously broken.\n\nThe real key here is that _even if the changes lowered Galio's win rate, they would have not been ok because they create unhealthy gameplay._ The initial change feels more like a bug than an intentional change. How little playtesting had to happen for that to go live? They _knew_ it was a big increase in damage, they _knew_ there was already a lot of concern from players and tales of it being ridiculous, and yet it still not only went live but such concerns were met with what felt like shrugged shoulders. I saw several Rioters comment on it and no one seemed concerned or even cautious. And then to top it all off... it took them too long to fix it.\n\nI would be less shocked and annoyed at a seemingly small change that ended up having a big effect. At least then there'd be justification for the ramifications being missed in testing. But this was _big, obvious, clearly in need of more than a couple games of testing_ and so I assume it got more than that, yet somehow went live.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2017-10-26T20:27:03.875+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":5,"body":"Agree 100%. Yes, Galio's balancing is really off. Yes, there have been similarly large and seemingly obvious balance issues in the past. For sure, the balance team does likely deserve some criticism for how some issues aren't anticipated well enough, or allowed to persist for too long. None of this, however, provides _any_ justification for calling any member of Riot to be fired. Everyone makes mistakes, and seeing how League is a) an incredibly complex game that is b) on the verge of one of the biggest balance upsets in its history, yet is c) still largely functional, I'd say the balance team is doing a pretty damn good job. It is always easier to criticize than it is to do anything, and while it may be understandable for players to be frustrated at the game's current state of affairs, instinctively lashing out at other people is _not_ the way to bring about anything constructive.\n\nSpeaking of constructive, as several other players have mentioned, posts calling for Rioters to be fired are _exactly_ the kind of shit that pushes them away from the Boards. When I was on the Warden team, I met a member of Riot who took it upon herself to _personally convince Rioters to post on the Boards_, simply because of how much they did not feel like going on here. When I asked her what the major problem was, she told me it was the toxic atmosphere and the baseless personal attacks against the developers. Calls to fire Rioters and similar bullshit are a prime reason why Gameplay is still not the healthy communication space between players and Riot that we've hoped for, and the users making those posts are simply making things worse for themselves and for others. \n\nWhile at this point it's already too late, I really think the \"balance team needs to be changed\" thread needs to be removed, as with any other thread like it. As long as it stays up, it conveys the message to everyone that it's okay to personally attack members of Riot, and thereby drive them away from Gameplay, and will continue to spawn more terrible threads like it. No matter how good the actual content in the OP is, that is something that can be posted in a thread with a less inflammatory title.","replies":[]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2017-10-26T19:21:13.703+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":4,"body":"They do a good job, yeah.
