The Aspect of the Serpent mechanic, a slow-build stacking passive which gives rewards at certain points, was thought to be pretty much all of these for Cassiopeia. It emphasized the identity we were going for, encouraged interaction in lane, and had a promise of being really exciting. It's accomplished a lot of the things it was meant to, but it fell miserably flat on the cool aspect and ended up feeling more like shackles than anything else. The idea of dramatically growing in power over game time through play is a cool one, but our execution was underwhelming. I want to get her into a more balanced state to truly eliminate any power variables before conclusively stating anything concrete about how the passive in its current state could feel (god that was wordy, sorry about that), but yeah it seems like it could use some work. That said, in a fully realized version of the passive, yeah I think it fits on Cassiopeia. If it never gets there, then no, certainly not.\n\n> After you started working on a new rework(Which is now complete and being pushed to live) Why insist on keeping the passive?\n\nSome of the above, but, basically, me and many of the other designers saw the promise in the passive but felt that a number of surrounding variables (power levels, weak poisons, clunky stacking mechanisms) were keeping it from actually feeling cool. We hoped to fix these surrounding problems to let the cool parts express themselves. We'll see how that goes. I suspect it's not quite enough yet and that the mechanics could still use some work, but our changes for 4.21 will definitely do some good for Cassiopeia and Cassiopeia players.\n\n> How does her new passive better fit in thematically vs her old passive?\n\nI'm not really sure where Deadly Cadence fit in at all thematically :<. Mechanically it made a lot of sense to me (Cassiopeia should be empowered to cast a lot of spells), though there were some realllly weird incentives there (like casting at the ground to keep it up, even while no enemies were around). But Snake Mage has little to do with rhythm (cadence) or reduced mana costs. \n\nUltimately, for a fun play experience, gameplay comes before thematics, but when the two tie-in some real magic happens, and that should always be the goal. To me, Aspect of the Serpent has a few more thematic hooks than Deadly Cadence. Through poisoning her foes, Cassiopeia becomes more and more adept at wielding the curse that befell her once normal body. She's driven to poison enemies, and as she does, she unlocks the potential of her new powers. This may not be the perfect marriage of thematics and gameplay, but I think it stands up pretty well.\n\n> Why do you refuse to change it after so much dislike has been placed on the new passive not getting the job done?\n\nI feel like I've answered this above :p\n\n> If you were to change it, what are you looking at as new possibilities for a passive?\n\nCassiopeia has a few really cool patterns. \n\n* Her fishing with Q's pattern, to get that MS boost for E follow-ups\n* Her on-the-fly kiting pattern of Q/E/E/Q/E/E, using W and R as necessary\n* Her turn-and-burn pattern, where she hits an E or two than lands a fat Q and walks away\n\nSo, likely something to encourage one or all of these. \n\n> Would you consider bringing back Deadly Cadence and working with that?\n\nEhhhh maybe. I had some gameplay issues with that one but there was *some* cool stuff there. So maybe if Aspect truly doesn't work out, and some form of Deadly Cadence*realllly* accomplished what I described in the above section, then maybe, though I find it unlikely.\n\n> Thanks in advance for your time, I know that people are being.. hasty on the new rework without most of them actually knowing whether or not it works, but I would just like to know what your thoughts are.\n\nNo problem!

You're right. That doesn't mean you replace it with something equally weird. The point of a rework is to *notably improve* in terms of theme, mechanics, and strengths/weaknesses.

On live you feel good when you hit your marks. 75 is cool where 200 a little else but still feels pretty good. Then the grind happens. You're roaming so you don't get to farm creeps, you don't get to interact with enemy Champions. Every fight you go \"I wish i Had 400 stacks right now\" because you know how much it will do for you. You start to reach the 30, 35, 40 minute mark and you keep telling yourself \"I want 400 stacks I want it I want it I want it!!\" and you drive yourself crazy. Then you hit 400 stacks and go \"Finally, if only I had gotten this 10 MINUTES AGO!!!\" (Alright this got a little out of hand, but you get the idea)\n\nThis applies to other marks a little less, but still relevant. It's how it holds you back from the potential you want. You farm long enough to the point you want it to be over, to where you can stop making excuses about your true power and if you should have been doing better in fights. You feel great hitting those marks, but like a carrot on a stick you want to grab it right away. It's knowing you're fairly strong yet you could be stronger. 20 % higher AP ratios is big, and the extra CDR means you get to use a lot of Q's and be constantly throwing W's down in sieges.\n\nOn PBE having passive stack gain will go along way, provided you don't increase the 400 stack count much higher (anything over 40 minutes is really annoying). I think her power level is great, for the most part (sometimes you hit someone with 10 E's and they still don't die).
