I mean. They're Champions. Of course there's something impressive about them. We've got sword-wielding knights who can go toe-to-toe with giant Void monsters. We've got little girls who can brawl with barbarian kings and Ascended guardians. I have trouble seeing how \"being old\" is a serious problem. That's kind of like saying, \"Hmm, this Thor character, I'm just not sure how a Viking with a short-handled hammer could really stand up to people with laser guns. He might need a giant mech or something to make it make sense.\" If you literally parse, for example, Caitlyn as \"a stern officer of the law who's a pretty good marksman\", or Garen as \"this guy with a sword who's really excited about yelling Demacia\", you've got some serious setting cohesion problems.\n\nThat said, sure, older Champions are usually portrayed as relying on cunning and skill rather than pure brawn. Swain doesn't run around doing dive-rolls and hurling cars at people. He grumbles at them, tells them to get off his lawn, and then morphs into a giant bird and eats them.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-08-16T04:13:01.242+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't think being old's any sort of problem for a champion, let alone a serious one.

Start talking about old female characters that are actual characters and we get somewhere really interesting. Examples of that I think are well done are M as portrayed by Judi Dench in various Bond films say, or the Dowager Countess in Downton Abbey as played by Maggie Smith.

Now, I may be overthinking this, but I'd want to be super careful if the champ team came up with a concept that also happened to be an old woman.  A lot of the time, when people think \"old lady\" they get a mixture of vibes or stereotypes:\n\n * Evil witch\n * Untrustworthy hag\n * Sickly/dying crone\n * Kindly granny\n * Doddering/harmless old biddy\n * Gossipping/meddling matriarch\n\nBasically, they split into two camps - untrustworthy and malicious witch/hag, and the harmless and mostly ineffectual grandmother type.  Neither of these are particularly healthy stereotypes and not usually something people aspire to be (or play).  I wouldn't suggest for a second that the champs team would fall into such easy pitfalls if they came up with one, but I am aware of the worry that ageism, and some (particularly Western) cultures often equate youth with good, and old with bad.\n\nConsider me selfish, but I'd like if whatever the next aged champ we create (that people obviously identify as being visibly aged - Lulu and Lissandra need not apply) to be something that is seen as not only powerful as all champs are, but a force for good.  That might needlessly limit the options, and I know that many here would really love to get their teeth into playing a full-on wicked Baba Yaga crone (I know I would!) but I would like at least one supernaturally awesome and aspirational old lady before we give the world another example of the examples above.\n\n(Characters like Super Gran, Professor Minerva McGonagall, and LoK-era Toph Bei Fong, are three cliche-busting examples.

What would you think she should do and how can she be unique in League of Legends?\"\n\nInstead Meddler and probably 85% of the people in this thread got baited into this stupid conversation about sexualization which is completely irrelevant and unrelated, except to say that \"literally nobody finds old ladies sexy\" which is not actually true (old men who are married to them probably find them sexy for example,) but even if it were, has nothing to do with why this thread exists. Anybody participating in that conversation is hijacking this thread for their own agenda, whether it's pro or con \"female sexualization.\" That is just blatantly **NOT** what this thread is for.\n\nYou make good points about how there's not very many archetypes that \"old ladies\" fall into, they really are just the ones you mentioned, and honestly, if it's between good witch/bad witch, and you want to ask what a good witch looks like, I think sadly you already have that champion: Lulu.\n\nLulu fits perfectly into the \"good witch\" archetype, she has witch-like nature-affinity (she has a sprite [nature spirit] that follows her around like a familiar) and is more about being harmlessly mischievous than actually combative. Some of this is coming from memory since I haven't looked at the old lore in a long time but she's either from or lives currently, or occasionally travels to this place called \"the glade\" right? That seems like some sort of Legend-esque land of raw natural magic. Lulu has a happy-go-lucky personality that is completely carefree. She says things that indicate that she has no worries in life and messes with people in funny ways (like polymorphing them temporarily, whether it be into a harmless forest critter, or making them huge) to maybe send the message that these warmongers need to lighten up sometimes. One can't help but get the feeling that Lulu is actually capable of immense displays of destructive power, but she chooses not to use her magic that way because she's more of a Chaotic Good nature.\n\nNow I say all this to basically just say that the \"good witch\" archetype is unfortunately already in the game and it doesn't belong to \"an old woman champion.\" I mean, maybe you could make a \"granny Lulu\" skin and people might buy it, but it seems like if we do want an \"old lady\" champ, she might have to fit into more of the \"evil witch/baba yaga\" archetype, unless someone can come up with another in-context role for an old woman to play in League of Legends.\n\nNow the other point that I started to make at the very beginning was about what the champions abilities are. Believe me, I know that in a competitive setting, aesthetic is important but it's not the be all end all for everyone playing the game, and the more competitive you are the less you care. If the champion has abilities that are really good, she will get played no matter what she looks like. So the discussion should really be more about what the character should do, than what they should look like. In the end it's the thing that matters the most, and it honestly bothers me to see so much discussion about the other, far less important issues.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Taarki","date":"2015-08-16T02:25:06.768+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"CRAZY CAT LADY! \nShe could throw cats at you and depending on what Cat you use (Q,W,E,R) they would have different effects.","replies":[{"poster":"Weiner the Pooh","date":"2015-08-16T03:26:05.343+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if yorick got that as a skin?","replies":[{"poster":"ArbiterOfTruth","date":"2015-08-16T04:08:09.274+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://lolskinconcepts.com/wp-content/uploads/yorick_lg_by_slowgun9-d6lad6d-900x533.png","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Marcia","date":"2015-08-16T00:10:58.016+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm all for adding an older female champion to the roster.
