Before the Zilean update was released, we had some time to tinker with broader ideas. In the end we didn't have the scope or resources to do more at that time, but the passive was definitely on our radar. At the time, I tested two main takes on the passive:\n\n* Passive as rewind\n\nThere are a couple potential versions of this. The one we played with was, \"Zilean can reactivate a spell while it's cooling down to cast it again. Doing so puts the passive on the spell's remaining cooldown,\" revolving around the choice of which spell to get back. I could also easily imagine a version of this that works identically to current rewind. One caveat to this approach is that rewind means the other spells have to be such that they're strong within reason when cast twice. That's not too hard when you've got two other spells to play with, but when there's three it gets a little trickier to make them all still feel good. Not a deal-breaker but something to keep in mind!\n\n* Passive as warp\n\nI tried a bunch of versions of this. Generally they involved Zilean being able to go to a place and mark it, then later return there by clicking on a thing there or by using his (targetable) recall on the spot. For example, one had it such that if Zilean stood still for a few moments, he'd leave behind a little ghost of himself he could click to warp back there.\n\nIn the short range warp case, it was cool and timey but didn't fit Zilean's gameplay well--he doesn't have a lot of reason to want to dart around and be mobile, so all it really did was make him safer. It also didn't fit his feel well outside his theme--characters that dash around a lot tend feel frenetic, hyperactive and tricksy; Zilean's feel is more \"above it all\", fast but calculated and in broad strokes, almost godlike. The summoner teleport-y versions were kind of neat, but didn't do much that summoner teleport didn't already do unless the way the spots were generated was extra interesting. Generating spots where Zilean saved someone with Chronoshift or where someone died was kind of cool, but felt more necromantic than temporal.\n\nGenerally I think using Rewind as the passive could work, but the idea I'm currently most interested is a spiced up XP passive. Things like more concentrated/interesting gameplay around XP, or potentially letting Zilean exceed level 18 are the things I'd like to look at if I get another chance to work on Zilean. Him getting some play in LJL was an awesome surprise, I really wanna see more of this guy on the rift.","replies":[{"poster":"20thCenturyFaux","date":"2015-08-11T23:07:17.520+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is definitely me, just not red tagged on EUW xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2015-08-11T21:21:44.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for the response (btw, how come you're not listed as a Rioter?)!\n\nIf you could find a way to make Zilean do unique stuff with experience and leveling, that could be fantastic, as it's a niche that's unique to him, even if it's not currently implemented in the best way. Would this be a passive that would only benefit Zilean, or would you also look to him being able to accelerate his allies' leveling?  I imagine an issue you'd have to tackle is that of remaining manageable even with an XP lead, since Zilean's current damage ramps up especially fast in the laning phase before significantly mellowing out, and preventing his allies from snowballing too hard may also be something to address.\n\nOn the subject of making every basic ability double-cast, though, I feel it's already possible even now. Time Bomb has enough damage on its own to be a noticeable ability, and its stun combo manages to be both strong and difficult enough to achieve that Zil doesn't go overboard with QWQ. Double-casting E doesn't seem to be really problematic, and I imagine potentially designing another active to work with a passive Rewind would allow you to better tailor a time-related skill to it that would remain under control.","replies":[{"poster":"20thCenturyFaux","date":"2015-08-11T23:06:10.567+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did it wrong when I posted, I think xD","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TotalJerk","date":"2015-08-10T02:26:33.530+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's such a fucking obvious idea and I can't understand why I or anyone else didn't think of it.

It's interesting theorycrafting but it would essentially change everything about his playstyle.  He DOES have a very, very specific and in-depth playstyle regarding the spacing of your double bombs in teamfights, what items/levels you need to reach certain movespeed levels, the combos you can do with your rewind... (for example, you can't speed yourself AND slow an enemy before double bombing.  Your passive removes that limitation, meaning they'd have to rebalance him entirely.)\n\nHonestly, I would like people to stop arbitrarily throwing out \"timey-wimey\" suggestions just because he's unpopular and they don't think his current kit is good.\nEDIT: Sorry, I wasn't referring to you in particular.  I'm talking about a common trend I see of people who don't play Zilean saying to throw in X generic time-themed spell in place of one of his core abilities.  It's just frustrating seeing people arbitrarily suggest to completely overhaul a favorite champion of mine with abilities that match thematically, but don't match his playstyle at all.\n\nIt is.

(Yes, he actually still can solo lane decently)\nNo offense, I'd just like something more synergistic with his kit.  Something that feels better, not just a passive \"your enemies are a tiny tiny bit weaker if they're near you.\"\n\nPersonally I think the XP aura is actually good - He scales well with levels, and hitting 6 first can mean a free 2v2 or 1v1 - but why did they keep it at 8% xp when they nerfed the range from global to a small area around him?\n\nThe current passive could work if they increases the XP bonus considerably.  Considering it went from helping all 5 allies to just yourself and maybe one other, they could have at least doubled it to 16%.\nSound too strong?  Maybe a team might actually, you know, have a reason to pick him then?
