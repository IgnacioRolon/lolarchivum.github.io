On paper Ohmwrecker sounds amazing, an active that disables an enemy turret allowing a hard engage when the enemy was relying on it for protection. So why doesn't that work? Because just simply buying armor and having the tank tank it does the job twice as well. Turrets are just simply useless in this game, they're weak and do no damage past early game, we know it and you know it (I remember you saying previously it was intentional due to fears that games would stall forever).\n\nWhat needs to happen is that turrets need a major rework to add gameplay to them. Right now they just point and shoot (mostly just uselessly at the wrong target). If they became a real threat with appropriate counterplay then items like Ohmwrecker, Banner of Command and Zz'rot Portal (actually had to check if that was still in the game before posting >_> ) would naturally become ideal assets to pick up.\n\nI imagine turrets where every X attacks against a champion deals additional % max health true damage so tanks can still tank but can't do so seemingly indefinitely (would be best as outer turrets). I imagine turrets that shoot skill shots at the ground that explode in an AoE blast so there's a bit of bobbing and weaving for the enemy as well as creating a bit of waveclear on their own (I think middle and Nexus turrets would work best with middle turrets having slightly higher AS and Nexus having more damage/bigger AoE as that last line of defense). And then I imagine Inhib turrets whose laser gets significantly more powerful over a few seconds but 'overheats' and must cool down before it can attack again. This of course on top of new offensive/defensive items and masteries (Garrison on SR, that could be cool) and much needed AI improvements (the amount of times i'll be just out of range of an allied turret and an enemy sitting right under it damages me yet the turret won't start targeting him is so annoying).\n\nThese are just random thoughts but the tl;dr is that Ohmwrecker is great on paper but it suffers from being a counter to something that is already underpowered rather than it being a bad item.","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2016-01-07T08:33:46.054+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly i don' t feel like that. Turrets do not need jumbled mechanics just for the sake of it. Remember that turrets are something that YOU protect, not something that protects you. What they have as tool is just to protect them from lone champions or common minion waves, and mostly is fine with that. If a champion comes with many others or with a minion wave then that' s it, the player managed to breach the tower.\n\nThis however raises another question... do we need an item that makes towers weaker?\nThe main reason there are champions devoted to picking on turrets, let them be splitpushers or AD carries, is because you want to take an objective, not fight it! The only thing you have to fight on is the defenders, but at later stages of the game is not that much worth focusing on disabling the turret but more dealing with the defenders.\nFor this reason the item proposed by Meddler, while not perfect, makes sense on its own: allows other classes different from AD carries to take towers, delegating the role to tanks and bruisers ( that otherwise can hardly take on a turret ) or, maybe, delegating the role to mages with a slight item stat change ( which honestly would be more interesting to me , since tanks and bruisers keep their \"defend the squishy and attract the aggro\" role contributing to more team collaboration ). The change anyway is focused on taking an objective rather making it weaker. It also makes more ideal the stats given by the item.\n\n\nWhere an item like Ohmwrecker in live could be useful? In cases where there is a scenario like the gates of Heroes of the Storm.\n\nFor those who do not know, in HotS there are turrets like in any other moba ( sorta), but said turrets come in pairs and between them there is a gate that allows friendly unit transit and blocks the enemy, with walls at the sides to further block unit transition.\nThis is a thing that always fascinated me because i always thought \"why the hell there are turrets here without gates?!\" in pretty much any moba, not only for real life comparisons but also for tactical ones.\nI am digressing. Point is: if the Ohmwrecker were in that situation where it not only disabled the turrets but also the gate, allowing the team to storm temporary the enemy base to get to the enemy, then we have an item with a proper interesting use: it does not fight the objective, but allows an easier fight with the enemy removing a barrier that is not stat-bound like turret damage, resulting in a tactical advantage.\n\nI know those bilge rats at Riot already thought this, if i recall right GC said a while ago that they were tempted to change Ohmwrecker active so it could be able to deactivate the side gate of the base, but that proposal died out not only because it was weird to have on a tank item, but also because side gates were meant to be a base _advantage _ and not something that could go against the defending team.","replies":[{"poster":"exe3","date":"2016-01-07T10:00:45.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a fair point you make but I feel to an extent turrets should be able to do *something* during a dive scenario, they are meant to be a safe zone of sorts (not immortal zone, but somewhere where you have an advantage). It just feels unfair with no correct action that could have been taken with many of the types of dives that take place atm, the onus seems to be on the divers to not screw up rather than the defender to make a good play.\n\nI'm not trying to suggest we make them super powerful, capable of defending themselves singlehandedly. I'm suggesting we should give them some tools that allow them to actually help the defending champions protect it, rather than just have it be ignored most of the time like is the case now.\n\nI also don't agree that these would be changes for the sake of changes.

If a tank is able to withstand many hits then it is deserved, it dedicated itself to that and pushes a proactive use for tanky items.\n\nNumbers more, numbers less, but the idea is there. In a game so subtly tied to numbers where an ignite can make a whole difference from a kill or not, i think that towers are clear and do enough.\n\nIt can be the case that i am so concerned about making the game conservative and stale that i am pushing away some needed safety however, that is debatable.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2016-01-07T05:10:03.699+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> At some point we will take another look at Ohmwrecker, though I suspect if it doesn't work out next time we'll probably end up cutting it.\n\nA moment of silence for Zephyr & all the other items we lost this past season.","replies":[]},{"poster":"La Bello","date":"2016-01-07T06:08:22.963+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=KbiAXyB8,comment-id=0025,timestamp=2016-01-07T04:39:58.065+0000)\n>\n> Yeah, Ohmwrecker's still in a pretty sad spot.

If you remember the shield that the outer tier 2 turrets gave to champs before, I'm suggesting something similar but in reverse. Standing near a turret would continue to place a growing shield on it up to a cap and the shield would fade if you left it's range.\n\nActive:\n\n2: Make an ally turret shoot faster. This is extra punishing to people who dive and help turrets clear minion waves faster.\n\n3: Make a turret's shots deal splash damage. This doesn't punish divers more, but the waveclear is still enhanced and all enemy champs that want to avoid damage would need to stand away from their minions.\n\n4: Perhaps Riot would be willing to bring back a reworked Fortify through this item. You would need to be in range of the one turret you want to buff (unlike Fortify's global & all-turret buff). Fortify helped with divers and waveclear by increasing the turret's attack speed on top of making it invulnerable for a period.\n* An alternate take on this could have it work like Tryndamere's ult, the turret would be able to take damage until it hit 1 hp. If this buff persisted for, let's say 15 seconds, then it would prevent those dives that happen right before a turret falls and would still be worth considering even if ranged champs would be able to auto the turret once after the buff wears off. Much more conditional that the normal version.\n\n5: Give a turret the ultimate anti-minion buff. This could only be used on a turret once a nearby minion applies the armor-reduction to the turret and this buff would persist until the armor-reduction would go away. Enemy minions will deal no damage to the turret and all shots from the turret will instantly kill any minion hit. If an enemy champ would draw aggro, the turret would receive an offensive buff (speed/damage/range/etc.) until it went back to using it's standard buff to kill the minions. This would help during conditional dives and would help against mid-late (especially baron enhanced) pushes.\n\n6: Reduce all damage the turret takes for a period. This doesn't punish divers, but can extend the lives of the turrets since their armor was nerfed this season. Not as useful during laning phase, but it could help those defending against the mid-late pushes. It wouldn't make turrets invincible, but the added defenses would deter pushes where the defense has at least the same number of champs as the offense.\n\n7: Force the turret to shoot an enemy champ in range. This could work by either selecting the champ you want it to shoot or by having the item automatically select the enemy champ with the lowest current health. This could be used to get enemy champs away from your turret, change the target during a dive from their tank to their carry, or finish off a low health enemy that's in range of your turret.\n* An alternate take on this could have the turret lock onto all enemy champs in range until they each leave it's range. This would heavily punish dives but not help waveclear at all.\n\nSo plenty of possibilities are there, just have to find one that would feel rewarding, fair to play against, and not become too strong of a choice. Of course those could also come down to the numbers on the buffs, but with that item's current niche it needs something to be worth picking over the other items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bârd","date":"2015-12-29T23:40:37.006+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Turn it into a modified {{summoner:17}} \n\"Allied Turret: Grant massive regeneration for 4 seconds\nEnemy turret: Disable basic attacks for 3 seconds\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2015-12-29T18:32:42.690+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"they actually removed an old summoner from the rift - Garrison - because turtling was a thing.making ohmwrecker useful would just promote turtling =/","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowParker","date":"2015-12-29T18:43:24.641+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think you're talking about Fortify, because Garrison was never on SR.\n\nThe thing about Fortify was that it made all turrets invulnerable while increasing their attack speed.

They are also buildings that the enemy team wishes to destroy.
