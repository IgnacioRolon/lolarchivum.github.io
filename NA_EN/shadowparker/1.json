If I hit tab I can see portions of the map where I'm standing blink in out constantly. The lower right half of my screen right above the minimap is distorted, almost as if portions of the screen near it are overlapping (blinking again).\n\nI tried a full repair but when I went into the practice tool to test it the whole thing was spazzing yet again.\n\nHelp? I've never had this happen to me before, and after a playing a whole game with it(since it was ranked) I started to feel a bit sick.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-07T23:43:03.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh wow, this sounds like a pretty serious hardware or driver issue that's failing to render properly.  Just in case, double check your air vents to make sure your pc has solid air flow.  Reinstalling is a good step, but I also recommend checking drivers and settings too.  Run through each step of our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide too to rule out these possibilities as well.  Test it in a custom and let me know if it helps.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowParker","date":"2017-06-08T07:12:18.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I tried reinstalled with no effect.

What do you suggest?\n\nThe only things I didn't do it install .netframe and do a clean boot on my computer, but surely there's a different way?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-08T15:19:29.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's really important to make sure your OS is up to date and has all necessary products to run League or anything else.
