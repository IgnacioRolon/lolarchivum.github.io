My problem with any map besides SR is that the chime rates are so low because they are tuned for SR that I usually only collect 30- 40 chimes.  If you could just keep in mind Bard&#039;s chime rates for future game modes that&#039;d be great.","replies":[{"poster":"L4T3NCY","date":"2016-04-10T06:57:33.590+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"In general, we don't do balancing for RGM game modes, as their goal isn't to be a 'hyper-competitive battlefield'. We do draw the line in a few extreme cases though, as our goal is to disable no champs ever in RGM modes.\n\n**-- When champs can permastun an enemy, we make changes.**\nAnd I don't mean that as hyperbole, I mean, the other play _actually_ doesn't get to click any buttons and play the game at all. EG: during dev, Zilean on URF, Brand on OFA, etc. This is simply unacceptable, but rather than disable the champion, we make a slight tweak and you can still enjoy the mode if you love Ryze, or whoever.\n\n**-- When the nature of a mode renders champs effectively unplayable, we make changes.**\nWhen a champ is _so_ underpowered that they're just not fun to play, it's almost worse than having them disabled. You feel tricked after picking them, finally get into a game, only to discover your favourite champ is the anti-URF. :/ In the case of Bard, we already increased his chime rates last year, but we'll probably bump them along a bit more this year.\n\n**Note on RGM champ viability: **\nNot all champions are expected to be equally viable in RGM modes. Champions are designed, crafted, and balanced around SR. That is a place where the endless pursuit of balance should take place. In RGM modes there will usually be a few over/under performers, but we keep a close eye on them and you have 6 bans just in case. ^_-","replies":[{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2016-04-10T08:52:44.315+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"When it comes to URF,can you guys decrease the death timers at the later portions of the game?Or at least give us back the Revive summoner spell?\nI don't want waste time watching others have fun.I want to hurry up & get back into the action........~~and die again~~ and have fun.\nAlso,any plans to turn the URF finishers back on?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Masalar","date":"2016-04-10T23:04:55.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't had a chance to test yet this year (lots of work plus long PBE queue times, plus forgetting for the few I got in), but for point number 2, Shyvana was that last year.

If we were to increase the Chime frequency back up to that of SR, then you would get a TON of Chimes packed very closely. Maybe they can instead have it that Chimes on other Maps count for 2 instead of 1 and adjust their spawn rates based on that? Or would that be too inconsistent and annoying for Bard players? I don't know.","replies":[]}]}
