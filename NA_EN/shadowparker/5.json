I&#039;d be much more interested in him getting a VGU to play up the spear wielder theme.\r\n\r\nWhy an update the size of a class?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-07-20T21:22:54.574+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We expect he'll get one eventually. We talked about him as a possibility for next year however and concluded there were other champs who needed a VGU more. That meant that a smaller update for Xin made sense, given there's definite improvement possible working within most of the constraints of the current kit and a VGU's at least 1.5 years away.","replies":[{"poster":"Sun Wu Ryuumoku","date":"2017-07-20T21:58:49.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2 question :\n- When will be ur next  Quick Gameplay Thoughts\n- u said {{champion:62}} wasn't high in priority... but can we hope to have a little update at least to give him a passive ?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-07-21T00:40:26.357+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Next post should be tomorrow, I'm generally aiming for a Tuesday and Friday of each week schedule at the moment.\n\nI'd imagine whenever we get a chance to do smaller work on Wukong it'll include some passive stuff.
