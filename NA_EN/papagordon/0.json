Once the sudden death event starts, the death timer is reduced to 15 sec.  So, if you are killed right before the event, it put the team in major disadvantage.  I am not sure the logic of implementing it.  My guess is, in order to have a quick game time, Riots give up the balance of the game.\r\nI have been having problem enjoying the new Nexus Blitz (both alpha and Christmas versions).  Although it is a quick game, it has no depth, and players come to the game just &quot;venting out.&quot;  When our team wins, I don&#039;t have the satisfaction like playing at the Rift or ARAM.  When our team loses, it is often due to the fact that we lost to the other team at the first 5-10 min.  It is just not my cup of tea.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-12-31T04:07:58.555+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's no attempt at balance in Nexus Blitz. It's just a bunch of [random craziness](https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2015/04/08/winnerism).","replies":[{"poster":"Fckjaxsuo43v3r","date":"2019-01-07T00:32:31.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This comics is about LOL, isn't it? Random luck is same level of skill or even for lower skill players tending to give them the lane, and Nexus Blitz being Rift bt faster and stompier. Just make a real battle royale mode so we can all go nuts killing and dying at the moment we respawn.\n\nOh wait! I just described Dominion! R.I.P. best mode in LOL simply deleted for no other reason than that it has been left untouched for years. If the rift had been put aside and dominion had been favored for the central game mode they might have removed rift instead. But they preferred update Rift every 2nd weak, balance the WHOLE game around 1 single mode and call it a day. Riot is Sloth, just too lazy to make their game good for every kind of player.\n\nNexus Blitz is stealing Dominion's place in the servers, just remove that unbalanceable random shit and give back dominion (maybe suppress entirely the control points and minions and make it a full fight mode with the same map).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"macspam","date":"2018-12-31T03:54:30.408+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seconded, nexus blitz does have some fun elements but i much prefer ARAM, even though its not balanced either (not that it could be easily balanced)","replies":[{"poster":"Fckjaxsuo43v3r","date":"2019-01-07T00:39:30.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"because nexus blitz has no gameplay. The events are random so you can't prepare for what's coming next before it's too late, the jungle lane thing is complete absurdity since it totally removes the point of having junglers (or even 1 jungler) and the jungle turrets are hidden so it's easy to get shot by it by lack of attention and lose a fight because there's no warning you're gonna be shot by this chameleon objective.\n\nAdd to this \"on fire\", \"destroy\" rune, \"herald\", and every random event leading to one team forcefully getting deleted because you can't choose when to fight since it's forced onto you by random events, and you have a 3 turret killing streak after each major event. 2 are enough to decide of the game outcome (often even 1 is enough).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"fire263","date":"2018-12-30T17:07:22.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, I believe if you die right before sudden death your death timer will be reduced to 15 seconds if you still had more than 15 seconds left in your timer so you won't be stuck for another 45 seconds or whatever.","replies":[]}]}
