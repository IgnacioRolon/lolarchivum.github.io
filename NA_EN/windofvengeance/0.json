Nothing about lee has ever been toxic, unfun, or unfair to play against, like his base 350 movespeed, 3 movement abilities, or his Q that for no reason deals extremely high base damage AND missing HP damage...\n\nBut its lee sin, so its fine, somehow has to make those LCS plays that 99% of players dont give a flying fuck about, right?  Lee sin.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2017-09-02T19:43:43.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jax still keeps the same ability, and the only one who lost it was kata i think? Maybe Braum had it for a while too.\n\n\nAnd lee trades it down because he´s weak if he doesn't get a lead, he can't just powerfarm and get strong.\n\n\nNot to mention the % missing health damage only applies on champ collision, meaning it doesn't really help him snowball.\n\n\nAnd he´s among the squishiest melee champions there are too, and his stat growth isn't anything impressive either.\n\n\nOnly interesting thing about him is his mobility and early game, which are used to snowball and try to end early or he will probably lose unless his team is strong.\n\nThat's why hardly anyone cares about lee.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
