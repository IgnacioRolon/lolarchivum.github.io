We don&#039;t care&quot;. Well I am posting about this because of one simple reason: I can&#039;t share this with anyone else.\r\n\r\nJust like Dunkey got banned almost 2 years ago. He was banned because he was &quot;toxic&quot; and it&#039;s true what he said &quot;I can understand being banned for cheating or going afk a bunch of times&quot; but why would you get banned for being &quot;toxic&quot; if someone is feeding/trolling on purpose and you can&#039;t explain that bastard that you are in your promotions . But Riot is basically putting people like that and people like me in the same box...\r\n\r\nLike I am far from being a good player, I ain&#039;t in high elo but I don&#039;t really care for elo as much as i care for having fun playing my favorite game of all times. After 3 years of playing, 4 accounts - 2 EUW(one perma banned for &quot;account sharing&quot;) 1 OCE and finally one here on the EUNE servers\r\n\r\nI didn&#039;t want to get a job for the past 3 years because I simply loved spending time playing this game and having fun with friends, even back in season 3 before the fancy map and the new champs (and all the game updates). I spent over $1000 on this game, supported it no matter what, played for almost 10-15 hours every day, and now I am compared to bastards that only play it for like 1-2 hours a day/week...\r\n\r\nSome of you have families and jobs and I respect that, no offence to you if you don&#039;t get to play the game as much as i do, but having a 3/19 Brand in your game inting on purpose... I am sorry but that&#039;s just the breaking point for me... And i report them after the game but i am the one getting banned because &quot;I was toxic towards a feeder/troll&quot;... Why?\r\n\r\nYou already took my main acc and now this?!  Thank you a lot Riot! For all the time, effort and money i put into this game! Thanks a lot.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S I do hope that one day you make a perfect game out of LoL I really do , but banning one &quot;toxic&quot; player out of millions and millions of trollers and feeder will not make a difference","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-01-27T01:10:50.817+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"so you let this one person tilt you so much you acted out and made an ass of yourself and got introuble for breaking the rules instead of just letting it go? and now after all the time and $ you put into something you love you are just gonna quit? \n\nhow bout just take your two weeks ban , chill out... not think about it. dont make a rash decision why you are upset and after the two weeks see how you feel and how the two weeks went not being able to play?","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-01-27T01:22:24.691+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"lol downvoted cuz i tell the guy to chill out dont quit while he is upset over the game give it a couple of weeks and then decided if he wants to quit... lol ok","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-01-27T01:43:38.083+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i thought u know not to care about upvotes / downvotes?\n\ninfact, i was sure that you know the multiple reasons why people downvote.
