When i looked i had 2147 IP. i went to buy 2, because 1025*2=2050, duh. but it said not enough IP, so i bought 1 instead to see if what i was thinking was true. I now have 714 IP. In case you didn't know that means 2147-714=1433. So i gave 1433 IP for a 1025 rune. Is there rune tax i didn't know about..","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-06T22:10:30.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds weird that you would be taxed for runes, and it's certainly not something I've ever heard of!  It looks like you also purchased a Greater Mark of Attack speed for 410 IP shortly before the quintessence and put you down to 712 IP.  I wasn't able to locate any issues here!

Otherwise, I hope that helps clear some things up!","replies":[]}]}
