Riot listened and fleshed out the power of masteries in the form of damages you can see the impact of and they aren't as strong as doubling your kit's damage. They are small, visible damage boosts that have a lot of variability between champions that use them and it's also understandable that not every champions is optimized to using all of them equally.\n\nOld masteries were optimized for all champions more or less (depending on the damage type) and you weren't changing them frequently. These masteries, including the Keystones are intended to be easily changed on the fly, depending on the needs of your champion. Not every marksman needs Fervor. You can use Thunderlord's, DFT, Bloodlust or even Stormraider's (if you're a marksman that deals a ton of damage, fast).\n\nSo, where's our apology?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limrick","date":"2016-09-09T06:26:01.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, they're just poorly done.

Keystones are interesting and allow for a MUCH greater amount of customization. HOWEVER, certain keystones (most notably fervor, but grasp of the undying is slightly guilty, as well) are entirely overpowered, and adding to that power is the fact that trinity force was changed to synergize incredibly well with it (probably unintentional, but still, the AS increase to triforce made irelia op with fervor and opened the bruiser yasuo build path). If riot just scaled back the free damage on fervor and scaled up the defensive masteries (ie defensive bonuses, not just keystones) I think this mastery system would be seen as a 100% improvement over the constant 21/9/0 system.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2016-09-08T15:41:32.867+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Nah masteries are fine and could give actual meaningful decisions if riot would care about them. \nSo far they tuned them a bit with buffs and nerfs and that's it. \nInstead they should have devoted themselves this season to make them actually perfect instead of changing everything at once.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Salron","date":"2016-09-07T23:04:28.283+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":3,"body":"Kuck Feystones","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThePartyLeader","date":"2016-09-07T23:59:09.752+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":17,"body":"7% armor and magic pen!
