A full tank can now build Atma&#039;s reckoning and do damage. Why is this necessary? they&#039;re tanks for a reason.\r\nit was hard enough to survive rengar that suicide kill you in middle of a team fight or the never dying udyr (he will even be more OP with new spear of shojin [2900 gold wtf so cheap])that&#039;s easy triple kill because your team lacks cc and you&#039;re playing immobile adc so nothing you can really do on your own but kite and die. now they also nerf shields, so protective supports like janna are practically useless?\r\ni&#039;m not the best player in anyway (i&#039;m just trying to have fun, i&#039;m sure we all are). I&#039;ve only been playing for about 2 years but I&#039;ve noticed a pattern in all the recent patches... riot hates adc&#039;s. when they nerfed crit damage they buffed yasuo so it doesnt hit him much so clearly they were just indirectly nerfing adc. \r\nRIOT just say you hate adc. nerf to rageblade, nerf to crits. jesus\r\nthank you for reading my mini rant :)","replies":[{"poster":"0 Hogapu","date":"2018-06-06T19:41:01.557+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"it's been a patch LOL\nthey've been broken for half a season lmao","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrHaZeYo","date":"2018-06-06T19:58:16.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry what?
