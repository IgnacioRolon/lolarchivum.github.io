Sion Ult turning, was that intended? Neither was Rivens attack animation cancelling. Riven is easy to play, I can play her easily. Riven is squishy. And the difficulties that come with being melee and squishy are not exempt from her. Know the difference. You know who's harder to play? Tryndamere. But he's even easier to pick up.

If Riven is REQUIRED to use those cancels to do well, that's a problem. Pro play should be having the reflexes to pick a card on the first rotation. Good play should be using Yasuo's dashes to fight people through minion waves. Good play is when you use a champions skills to make plays. If one day, Garen had a bug that would let his Q remove the animation resulting in instant silences as soon as he was in range, would people be okay with that? Or if Singed could flip people even if they fla- oh wait he already does that.\n\n> So, no, sorry OP, but I hate the idea of making Riven easier.\n\nAnd I don't like the Idea of a champion being balanced based on an exploitable bug in her kit. It's a bug, because it doesn't state anywhere in the tooltip, nor does it say anywhere in champion interraction data that the cancelling was intended. (correct if wrong).

There is always some difference between the minimum level of what you can do and the maximum. What I was trying to say that you apparently didn't understand is that your assertion of riven isn't a high skill cap champ is short sighted and shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the concept. The difference in skill between a riven who uses the kit to the maximum and one who can do the bare minimum will be greater than the difference between say an Annie who uses the kit to the maximum versus one that uses it to the minimum. Annie relies more on decision making and timing than on the skill mechanics of the kit. There is only so much that can go wrong with her combo and adding auto attacks between spells doesn't change that much in terms of damage. However, even if both Riven players pick the right decision at the right time, her passive requires autos in between to make full use of damage, plus she can avoid damage or reposition her opponent w/ her 3rd hop and change the damage equation that way too. So the player who isn't as good at making the clicks and doesn't auto in between spells or walk in between casts will do much worse compared to the high skill player than the same scenario if they are both on Annie. This is what is meant by high skill cap, it is not the ability to play them or how strong they are when you play them bad, it is the ability it takes to play them and get every possible benefit they can provide. For riven that difference is higher than most champs, and I was trying to point that out in a concise manner without insulting you, but I suppose I should spell it out in an explicit manner since you need that to understand.\n\nIn before kitten rage about how I'm wrong with out supporting evidence or a logical argument that is as sound as mine. \"Naw bro, I'm good at riven in bronze elo and she is stupid easy.\" \"Naw man, riven pub stomps me all the time, and those players mess stuff up a bunch but she's so strong and takes so little skill I lose anyway.\" lol good luck w/ the response and I hope it is at least eloquent if it is going to be as uninformed as your last one.","replies":[{"poster":"The Bíg Ticket","date":"2015-04-23T19:26:10.184+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lol why are you mad? Your post is really good and you don't have to worry about insulting me. The last paragraph is kinda lame though, I will try my best to match your level of eloquence, however english is not my native language so I hope you can forgive me 1 or 2 mistakes. Btw I am Plat, not bronze :)\n\nAs for the actual argument, yes I do get how Riven's kit works and that making proper use of autoattacks will increase her damage output by alot, I have played vs good Rivens and bad Rivens and there are few champs who are more reliant on the person playing him/her. However this does not give her a high skill cap, as I said in my other post to which you also replied I believe (atleast your name sounds familiar) I would rate her skill cap as medium. She is a very forgiving champion, who has to manage one resource bar which is hp, she has very easy ways of getting cs, even under your turret you shouldn't fail any lasthits, which puts her on the same level as Zed. Her laning is very easy once you found out how her combo works, her kit allows her player to make tons of mistakes without being punished for it wheras she has all the tools to punish you for every small mistake you made and lets be honest, you don't even have to do your combos properly to outdamage 80 percent of the common toplaners in trades, you farm Brutalizer, go back to lane and all in. 300 gold.\nYou are trying to differentiate between champs like Annie who requires decision making and Riven who requires being able to click the right buttons at the right moment, yes I will admit that you probably need faster fingers than the average person to pull off a flawless Riven combo (which is rarely needed though to outdamage your opponent) but in exchange for that you get a kit that allows you to constantly overextend, to only have to worry about one resource, to farm as good and easily as Zed, to 1v1 close to any champ in the game, where is the downside in her kit? She is NOT hard to play well, you just gotta know the combos, and this goes for a lot of champs including Zed or Yasuo. \nThen you also have champs like Kog Maw or Jinx who are mechanically easy to play but require alot of skill to position properly and avoid dying in teamfights, and you probably cannot deny that there is a huge skill gap between Kog Maws who can position and Kog Maws who can't.\n\nTl;dr: Riven is mechanically hard to play but thats not the only thing that determines the skill cap of a champ.","replies":[{"poster":"T RexHasLongLegs","date":"2015-04-23T21:59:05.151+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That is a rather impressive level of skill with english given that it isn't your native language. It is mine and I still can't spell even after a few years of therapy for dyslexia. :D\n\nI probably was more cranky than I should have been (my apologies) since it was morning when I wrote that and I'm not a morning person. I actually really like that explanation. I'm not entirely in agreement with it but it is well thought out and a very sound argument and so I can respect it much more than the overly simplified version you gave earlier. I think you're right that riven is a really strong champ. She's like lee sin, in that her kit has so much potential to play any problem out that if you have the mechanics to use the kit she's hard to balance.\n\nPersonally mechanics are probably my weakest point and so I'm biased in that I tend to conceptualize skill cap in terms of difficulty of champion use. Positioning for ADC is a great example in that it is definitely the defining factor between a really good ADC and a mechanically good ADC. If I think about it as skill at the game or skill at the role I can definitely agree with your argument when I hear the whole thing. I still feel that when it comes to champion skill cap it should be defined in terms of difficulty of achieving maximum skill with that champion. As such I would probably consider champs like Lee Sin, Riven, and Zed higher skill cap than you would, but you would probably consider my favorite champs (nunu and heimerdinger) higher skill cap then I would consider them because they require more game skill to be effective (you have to identify the strongest players on your team to help as a support style player while managing objective control and tracking enemy jungle, or you have to make decisions about which ult is most useful in a particular team fight and how and where to set up turrets to control the area you want to and push an advantage while staying safe).\n\nWhile I think your elo probably doesn't change the quality of your response, I'm sorry I made the dig at bronzies in general. I had to climb out of bronze in S3 when I started ranked (god I was bad) and this season when I started and was terrible after the break I took. There are a bunch of people in bronze and silver who are likely strong players but have such terrible attitudes they can't overcome that handicap and so often when someone is negative in comments and doesn't explain themselves I assume they share that mentality. It's refreshing to find someone who takes the time to explain something instead of just getting pissed off (especially when I was a bit more rude than I should have been :D).","replies":[{"poster":"The Bíg Ticket","date":"2015-04-24T09:08:36.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright man, no worries.

At the very least, it's gotten me low enough to where I can't contest minions anymore, and then I'm fucked for when the inevitable lvl 2 flash W Q auto ignite kills me.","replies":[{"poster":"ScreamPaste","date":"2015-04-24T01:41:25.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"If Riven enters an auto attack war at level 1, and you're not a turret-less heimerdinger, standing in the river, with no friends nearby, she deserves what happens to her.

She gets too strong at low levels, gets nerfed, becomes trash, and worst, loses mechanical complexity and becomes comparitively boring. Nothing about this is good, so why do you want it?\n\nI like Riven. I think she's fun and has a good place in the game. I even enjoy playing her from time to time. What I do not enjoy is having her power gated by a fighting game-esque mechanic that makes her burst and dps far higher than it is supposed to be, which forces Riot to keep her numbers undertuned. Hell, I'm a fucking Yasuo main, and their playstyles and skillsets are similar, with the exception that Yasuo's power level isn't tied to a stupid animation canceling mechanic, not to mention an overly complicated one. \n\nFrom my understanding, in order to properly cancel Rivens Q, you need to Q the enemy, right click on the ground to give a move command, and then right click the enemy. My question is, why does that second step even exist? If Riven is supposed to be able to animation cancel like that, why have an extra step that makes it harder to perform? None of the champions I play have a similar mechanic that I'm aware of. You can cancel part of Yasuo's auto animation with his E, and that's all you have to do. No need to click on the ground first or any other strange mechanic that doesn't make sense in a moba. If Riven is intended to be able to chain Q's and autos together that quickly, why not have it as a simple Q, right click, Q, right click, Q, right click? And don't say, \"Because it's not fair to all the Riven players that learned how to do it the hard way.\" That wasn't a valid argument against jungle timers and it isn't a valid argument now. Hell, I wasn't there when it happened, but I'm sure all the people who never accidentally bought or sold an item were mad when Riot introduced the undo button too.\n\nLike I said in the first paragraph and in previous posts, I actually like Riven. I like her kit, I like her playstyle, and I like how she fits into the game. But, I want Riot to do either 1 of 2 things; Make Riven's animation canceling easier or remove it entirely so    they can actually balance her properly. Then we can see who the best Riven players are by their decision making and decisiveness rather than by who fucks up their animation canceling the least. If Riot were to decide to remove her animation canceling mechanic, I would be all for buffing her to compensate, perhaps by quite a bit. I just want a mechanic as inane and un-intuitive as Rivens Q-Auto animation canceling out of the game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dunkrius2g","date":"2015-04-23T22:35:38.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She might.

It's about the fact that because that mechanic exists when it honestly shouldn't, and Riven has to be balanced on the assumption that people are going to abuse this mechanic. Hell, would the last few Riven nerfs  have been necessary if she couldn't 100-0 nearly every top laner at lvl 1 assuming she did her animation cancelling properly? \n\nThe point, is that Riot has to keep her numbers intentionally low because all her animation canceling allows her to do things she honestly shouldn't be able to do. And frankly, it takes control away from her opposition. Either she can animation cancel well under pressure and I lose, or she can't and I win. That's pretty much 100% in the Riven players hands. It's a mechanic where the only \"counterplay\" is to hope the enemy Rivens APM sucks. And that leaves Riven is this bizarre balance limbo where she's overpowered in the hands of people can have mastered that 1 mechanic and underpowered for everyone else.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-04-23T03:04:00.644+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"http://champion.gg/champion/Riven\n\nI don't think Riven is really suffering atm lol","replies":[{"poster":"qetzel","date":"2015-04-23T12:00:12.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But look at that Player Experience Distribution chart.

Perceived \"freelo\" champs have people temporarily jumping on board the train and then jumping off. If you want champions who are highly mained then largely you go down to the underplayed/obscure champions like Anivia (who also has a very high proportion of players with over 50 games on her), because people just don't pick up champs like that casually. \n\nRiven is legitimately one of the game's most mained champions and it's not because \"OP\".

Riven, as she is now, is more or less balanced. But she is balanced around her animation canceling mechanic that allows her to do things she shouldn't be able to do. And its a dumb mechanic that there is no way to learn other than from another Riven player; it's pretty clear that Riot never intended for her to be able to weave q's and autos together that quickly, even if they now balance her on the assumption that people will. And that's my point, they have to make her numbers undertuned because of a mechanical abuse that Good Riven players can do that makes her DPS far higher than Riot originally intended. And it's not even a mechanic that has any sort of decision making to it. There is literally no reason to not animation cancel for the higher dps if you can pull it off, no matter the situation. It's honestly just an extra layer of difficulty that serves no purpose and adds no meaningful interaction between Riven or her opponent, since you can't counterplay high apm.\n\nI'm not calling for Riven to be nerfed. If they take out the ability to animation cancel, I would be more than happy to see buffs on her to compensate. I personally like Riven as a champion, I think her kit is interesting and has a good place in the game. I just don't want her to have to be balanced around an abuse case that Riot won't remove for some reason.\n\nOn another note, the idea that one mistake can set Riven extremely far behind garners absolutely no sympathy from me, as a {{champion:157}} main. I have exactly all the same weaknesses that Riven does, except I can't escape pretty much any gank with 4 dashes and an on demand stun. And you know what? Thats totally fine, because Yasuo and Riven both have kits with such absurd outplay potential and are so oppressive when ahead that people deserve to bully you if you fuck up.

Every single champion will become a bother one way or another once fed; Mundo for example can't really do shit damage but he can run around pissing people off with his 5k HP and ludicrous regeneration making it impossible for you to assasinate the adc. She gets easily countered and outsustained, and because of her kit's predictability she can be countered even more with player skill. If you remove one aspect of her, you HAVE to compensate in some other form. You want her to have a stronger stun? I don't think so. You want her to have a stronger shield that covers a bigger distance(longer dash) even without extra AD? You want her to be an actual impact early game even without items?
