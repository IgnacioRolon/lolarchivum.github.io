Meanwhile my 0/5 Ezreal was bitching about how Udyr is a shit champ who does nothing which apparently was the reason why he was 0/5 at 4 mins. I told him I can't gank his lane because he has no pressure since he was getting zoned to tower and still dying against a fucking Vayne Janna lane, but he insisted that it was meant to happen. I ganked, we died, GG. He then told me that Udyr gets kited too easily which is the reason Vayne was fed and just stood on the pad for the rest of the game spewing bullshit into all chat.\n\nI didn't even stop to look at post game chat, I just reported him with no comments then just jumped directly to the next game. After picking Udyr again I noticed that the enemy team had the exact same Ezreal player and that his support was the same guy as last game. Needless to say I camped the god given fuck out of his lane.\nHe and his support never warded aside from their crappy trinket wards, so it was easy as hell to get in behind them since they were doing nothing but pushing, then he started bitching about how Udyr was a broken champ and that him moving at 500MS is OP even against champs like Ez who have blinks. I told him \"just kite me...you said it was easy right?\" which was when he realized I was the same person and proceeded to AFK again.\n\nGetting to report that guy twice in a row was the best feeling ever. I just wish the Tribunal and reports actually did anything these days.","replies":[{"poster":"Spacesuit Spiff","date":"2015-04-03T17:21:32.134+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Love the story, only part I dont believe is the adc using the trinket ward lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2015-04-03T17:40:33.654+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Believe it or not, some ADC's actually know how to use trinkets.\n\nThe next step is teaching them not to put it in the middle of the lane.\n(Heaven forbid you make it past that; teaching them how to put it in bushes.)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DeathMagix","date":"2015-04-03T12:24:48.843+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't wait 'til they implement the Tribunal again.
