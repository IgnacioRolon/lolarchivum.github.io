Just reply to this e-mail or click the link below to add any additional comments.\r\n\r\nhttp://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/31490810\r\n\r\nBest of luck on the Fields of Justice!\r\n\r\nSkeletor\t\r\nSkeletor (Riot Games Player Support)\r\nAug 25, 10:00 PM PDT\r\n\r\nI appreciate the offer, but I have all the information on my end to confirm the information. As there are no new questions I will have to be closing out the ticket :(.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nSkeletor\r\nRiot Games Player Support\r\n\r\nAE navE\t\r\nAE navE\r\nAug 25, 9:42 PM PDT\r\n\r\nWhat if i proved to you that the account was hacked? I have emails from riot support\r\n\r\nSkeletor\t\r\nSkeletor (Riot Games Player Support)\r\nAug 25, 9:30 PM PDT\r\n\r\nI have looked into your concerns and I don&#039;t see any inductions of unauthorized access to the account. As this is the case the suspension would be justly placed and will not be removed.\r\n\r\nIf you have anything new you would like me to address please let me know.\r\n\r\nSkeletor\r\nRiot Games Player Support\r\n\r\nAE navE\t\r\nAE navE\r\nAug 25, 8:12 PM PDT\r\n\r\nWait so you didnt ban me for being toxic..? But thats what you last emails have said? And also for the 5 time... This account has been HACKED by someone thats not me!!!! The hacker was TOXIC... I on the other hand are the opposite of toxic according to your last email.\r\n\r\nSkeletor\t\r\nSkeletor (Riot Games Player Support)\r\nAug 25, 5:12 PM PDT\r\n\r\nThere is a gray area in toxicity, these chats are not excessively toxic and would fall within the lines of continued negativity. This account has been warned many times about the behavior and because it continued after multiple warnings we were forced to issue the final discipline to the account.\r\n\r\nI know that there are accounts that are unbanned and I have already reviewed this account for that process, however looking at the account&#039;s history another chance does not work in this situation.\r\n\r\nAll this aside, there is no one above me who handles these matters and regardless of which agent I give this to they will all give you the same answer. Also, note that the founder doesn&#039;t answer emails :(.\r\n\r\nIf you have anything new you would like me to address please let me know.\r\n\r\nSkeletor\r\nRiot Games Player Support\r\n\r\nAE navE\t\r\nAE navE\r\nAug 25, 2:04 PM PDT\r\n\r\nThese chats you have provided are strategic and helpful to my team, in no way are these toxic. In the past bans I didnt think i deserved them and i wanted to say something about them but each time i said im going to be even more careful and even less aggressive and you can see that in each ban how my level of toxicity has gone down... am I right? I would like to talk to a person in a higer position or ill just email the founder or Riot its self if needed. This ban isn&#039;t right...\r\n\r\nAE navE\t\r\nAE navE\r\nAug 25, 1:58 PM PDT\r\n\r\nSo you&#039;re telling me that trying to help my team is toxic? How? and why is no one even considering the fact that this account has been hacked before and the hacker was toxic? I am a reformed player and do not deserve this ban... Ive seen many other toxic people become unbanned on youtube... i can list the URLS if you would like. But the difference between me and those people is im not toxic. Please help me out man I wont let you down\r\n\r\nSkeletor\t\r\nSkeletor (Riot Games Player Support)\r\nAug 25, 1:44 PM PDT\r\n\r\nHey there,\r\n\r\nI know it&#039;s hard to lose an account and I will do my best to point out and explain what lead to this but know that after reviewing the content and the account history, I will not be reducing the suspension. That said, we have a zero tolerance policy for consistent negativity, as it is offensive, and as it ruins other player&#039;s experience.\r\n\r\nLooking at your account&#039;s history it looks like you were warned about this behavior with a previous two-week suspension. Please understand that a two-week suspension puts and account on very thin ice, and all negative behavior will need to stop immediately or the account will be permanently suspended.\r\n\r\nThat said, I want to take a moment to talk about the chat that triggered this suspension as there seems to be a disconnect on what we are finding offensive.\r\n\r\n32:24] AE navE (Draven): im confused\r\n[32:31] AE navE (Draven): there is open mid\r\n[32:35] AE navE (Draven): we have feed\r\n[32:37] AE navE (Draven): yi and draven\r\n[32:40] AE navE (Draven): hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\r\n[32:56] AE navE (Draven): y is no one hlp\r\n[32:57] AE navE (Draven): yi?\r\n[33:00] AE navE (Draven): YEA FR\r\n[33:02] AE navE (Draven): can we\r\n[33:04] AE navE (Draven): come MID\r\n\r\nThese chats show severe signs of continual negativity where you are berating your team. Understand that we treat this type of behavior strictly as it ruins the experience for others. While these single instances of negativity would not be enough to ban your account outright. You have been persistent in this type of behavior which we have warned you many times about.\r\n\r\nKnow that each player is held responsible for their own actions, so If players are flaming you or being offensive, it&#039;s never beneficial to respond to them with flame, whether it&#039;s in self-defense or if it&#039;s out of frustration. It&#039;s always best to mute toxic players and report them in the post game lobby, so you don&#039;t get disciplined as well.\r\n\r\nPlease understand that once an account is suspended permanently, that there is no way to regain access to the account or any of its content. Our stance is strict because we want players to take the reform process seriously.\r\n\r\nI wish you luck moving forward on whatever game you decide to play from here.\r\n\r\nSkeletor\r\nRiot Games Player Support\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis was the emails i had back and forth with riot support feel free to have someone check the emails... i dare you. this isnt a scam to get unbanned.. riot actually perma banned me for this... please help","replies":[{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2017-09-07T23:27:00.499+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How many punishments have you had?","replies":[{"poster":"AE navE","date":"2017-09-07T23:28:09.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":12,"body":"not many but does that even matter in this case i was helping my team non the less","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2017-09-07T23:44:14.188+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"> not many \n\nA lot.\n\n> but does that even matter in this case i was helping my team non the less\n\nIt does matter.

into account. You have had EIGHT penalties. Only a small minority of players in Leeg ever get ANY penalty, let alone 8. It's a huge number. You got off a 14-day ban ONE day before the perma ban. You were warned that you were on a short leash, and to avoid harassing other players or it would result in a perma ban. So, if this chat would be worthy a a chat restriction, you get a permanent ban.\n\n> [40:26] AE navE (Draven): ff\n[40:34] AE navE (Draven): ff\n[40:35] AE navE (Draven): plz\n[40:37] AE navE (Draven): im done\n[40:40] AE navE (Draven): 40 min\n[40:41] AE navE (Draven): yawn\n\nNot strategic.
