I occasional have bad games, because I'm tired or I'm rusty after a break or it's freaking cold and my ability to quickly hit the right keys was thrown out the window, and I end up recognizing my mistakes only after the fact.  We all have these days.\n\nWhen I'm like this the last thing I'm interested in is advice from someone I don't know.  I know that I'm playing bad, I know why I'm playing bad, but at that time I'm unable to fix the root cause, and some blanket advice won't be enough.  What I need at that moment is some reliable shot calling from someone who shows an ability to control the flow of the match, not tips on playing my current champion.\n\nIf someone is trying to be nice about it I'll usually apologize and explain why I'm being a lead weight, but I do understand I'm in the minority.  There are always people out there who very violently reject advice, and people who think the only way to give advice is to offer it with a hefty dose of condescension.  I've found it's best to just let people from either extreme do their thing, and mute them if they become a problem.  You can't force a horse to drink and all that, but you can save yourself a headache by only leading the thirsty ones to the river.","replies":[{"poster":"Six Inch Heals","date":"2018-01-04T22:42:36.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want consideration from teammates, it doesn't need to be predicated with \"well if you're nice to me, I'll apologize and try.\" \n\nThis comes off as entitled.","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2018-01-04T22:45:42.016+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, is this a direct reply to me, or are you just adding on?

When I'm playing poorly it's not because I'm not trying, it's because I'm trying and failing for one reason or another.  I'm going to try and win and be a useful part of my team no matter how my team reacts to my play, but I'm only going to type and explain the position I'm in, and apologize for it, if my team isn't a bunch of asshats.","replies":[{"poster":"Six Inch Heals","date":"2018-01-04T22:53:36.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"but I'm only going to type and explain the position I'm in, and apologize for it, if my team isn't a bunch of asshats.\"\n\nTherein lies the problem. You shouldn't be here for friends or praise. While I somewhat agree that being rude to players is not fun and not okay, I find the entitlement of ruining 4 other players' experiences in ways they can't easily mitigate (ex. muting) a bit more of an offense than calling someone a dingbat or similar.\n\nNot saying this applies to you per se, but I wonder when most of the playerbase will realize that 95% of toxicity is mitigated by opening your mouth and being honest? \"Hey, I'm having a tough game, sorry.\" or \"I have never played this character.\" in the beginning as to leverage expectations. Anytime I've done any of the above, I've had NO drama. It's so easy!","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2018-01-04T23:08:12.733+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Not saying this applies to you per se, but I wonder when most of the playerbase will realize that 95% of toxicity is mitigated by opening your mouth and being honest?\n\nThat would be a wonderful day.  I absolutely love it when I run into people in game that are willing to speak their mind without being rude and show other players respect.  Too often it just doesn't feel worth the risk of opening up and being honest to people, but sometimes you run into the right person and it all becomes worth while.\n\nThe best example I can think of was back in season 3.  I was playing a bit of ranked and I got my worst role, ADC.  Everyone else was comfortable with their roles, and so no one wanted to trade with me.  My jungler was an experienced ADC and he walked me through what I should be doing at each part of the game, and while I didn't come close to carrying I was able to avoid being a dead weight.\n\nHe wasn't just telling me what I should be doing, he was helping me get better at playing ADC.  I still suck at the role, but what I learned that game has helped me quite a bit over the years in understanding both my ADC and the enemy one.  Most people would have just said \"do your best\" and silently judged until the post game where they would vent, or would straight up vent at me in game, but this guy didn't.\n\nI've been burned way too many times to count, so I'm definitely more reluctant to take the first step these days, but if someone else does I'm more than happy to follow suit.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"PePsiLemoNN","date":"2018-01-05T00:01:31.862+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cause they have literally 0 reason to listen to a random soloQ player that is the same rank as them?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tibold","date":"2018-01-06T02:00:43.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because of their Ego.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EL HAMSTERO","date":"2018-01-05T04:31:03.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dont give someone advice unless they ask for it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-01-04T22:55:59.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a few reasons why.\n\n\n1. majority of the time it's just flaming.\n2. the mindset of \"were in the same elo, you aren't any better\"\n\n\nSo the genuine helpers are brushed aside.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-01-04T22:55:36.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"their ego too stronk","replies":[]}]}
