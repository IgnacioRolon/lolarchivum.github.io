This highlights important things.\n\n* You can hit a target directly left or right of Blitz, but not behind him.\n* The left or right hit is determined by where the Skill Shot is aimed at (Blitz will snap to that angle).\n* The hitbox on the long part is a bit wider and does not shrink.\n* The end of the arrow is the furthest the projectile goes.\n* The lollipop shape at the end.\n\nThere is still a lot of room for creative shapes and decorations.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ZTryo37.jpg[/img]\n\nComparison:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/lv7g8GI.jpg[/img]\n\n***\n\n#**Example #2: {{champion:25}} 's Q**\nThe projectile hits enemies in the far away corners, so it's probably a rectange that moves along the path.

This is to account for the fact that many players don't fully consider things like travel time and champion hitbox size when throwing their spells.  They'll fire at things \"just on the edge\" that they expect to hit.\n\nIf skill shot line indicators were perfectly accurate it would result in a lot of missed spells that were fired with an expectation to hit.\n\n———————————————\nEdit: here’s an example for better clarity. \n\nI ran into a problem with Jinx W. When the indicator was exactly accurate people were more likely to tell me it “missed more than expected.” This is because, while the missile is very fast, it still has travel time so shooting at someone who is max range away will almost never hit them. A shorter indicator was more representative of the “effective max range.”\n\nPeople are rarely going to be upset if their skill shot hits something that they thought was slightly out of range. In that case, expectations are broken in a positive way, “Oh nice I didn’t expect that root to hit!” They WILL be upset if their spell misses something they expected to hit, “WTF they were in range but the spell didn’t reach them. This indicator lies!”\n\nThis is further confounded by the fact that most players’ default assumption is that skillshots “cheat” the indicator a bit.  An indicator that is perfectly accurate can often feel as though it’s lying about the true range of the spell, because of EXPECTATIONS.","replies":[{"poster":"hoglo","date":"2019-12-20T00:50:44.894+0000","up_votes":65,"down_votes":6,"body":"Is this really the reason why you put wrong and misleading information in the game?\nThis is probably not helping players, it's making things more complicated than they need to be.\n\n* If I'm standing still in a brush and waiting until an enemy approaches me, I have to \"guess\" and add however much I think you made the indicator shorter back and then predict the collision with the enemy's movement and the projectile.\n\n\n* The text reads _\"ACTIVE: Blitzcrank fires his right hand in the target direction, dealing ...\"_\nWell he actually doesn't because that would mean that the projectile is a blob that starts on Blitzcrank's right side and goes forward. But it's actually a blob from his center and only while testing this I found out that I can hook enemies on his left.\n\n\n* Patch notes a) _\"Fixed a bug where Blitzcrank's hook range was longer than intended against bigger targets\"_ (and on the Wiki: _\"BUG FIX: Lollipop now checks for the target's center rather than their edge, alike the missile. No longer gives an effective bonus range towards larger units.\"_)\nThis doesn't even mean anything when there is no way of knowing what the end of the projectile looks like.

It's simply showing them the optimal range and hitbox of their abilities relative to the game.

Same with shortening indicator lengths, you teach the player optimal range instead of range where enemies can walk out of. \n\nIt's design that teaches the player how to play optimally, and with experience and time on a champion, people can get a true feel for their abilities accurate range. This is far more beneficial for new players, who are still getting the timing and feel for their champion's abilities. It's telling players \"Hey, this range is where you're most likely to hit abilities\", with the missing space being the places that most commonly result in misses. \n\nWhile it may be more \"Honest\" to give the accurate information, this honesty doesn't help them. Optimal indicators teach the basics, while time and experience teach the limits and veteran knowledge: The same thing that you want from accurate indicators, people learning by trial and error instead of being 'helped' with smaller indicators.

Skill shots are a joke now for this reason. You can miss by a pretty wide margin visually and things still click onto the enemy hitbox. Lee Sin Q, Hooks, Morg Q, etc. Visually skills are missing but the last second RNG pass they get is infuriating handholding that doesn't belong in the game. It looks buggy and cheap to be honest, but for some reason it is actually an intended feature. \n\nPair that with the sneaking suspicion by players for years that something was off about indicators and hitboxes &amp; you have a lot of frustrated people who want some real answers and fixes. The rioter gave an answer and people aren't happy or satisfied with it because it really does sound like bullshit. An indicator is supposed to lead the player in the right direction.. but then you have misleading indicators on the receiving end for the purpose of inflating the enemy's ego (Jhin R). Yuumi's comment wasn't some icebreaker to meaningfully discuss the issue at hand or 'open dialogue' about it with the community. They said their piece as fact, tried to justify it a bit with some nonsense about helping new players along somehow, and that was that. \n  \nIf an indicator shows that I am safe but the enemy sees me as juuuuust within range\nthat is broken. sorry but that is completely unfair bias. same with hook champ lollipop effect. \nSkill shots need to be something that takes skill again. Because in case you didnt notice, most 'skill' shots lead to instant death. That was the tradeoff. You miss, no kill. You land? Kill. Well now you can miss and still get the kill. \n\nfun shit","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"iLLp","date":"2019-12-21T14:13:28.268+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ulanopo,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jHZIm50L,comment-id=000b0003000000000001,timestamp=2019-12-21T01:07:09.902+0000)\n>\n> Academy Kayn isn't \"white knighting\" anything.

When the indicator was exactly accurate people were more likely to tell me it “missed more than expected.” This is because, while the missile is very fast, it still has travel time so shooting at someone who is max range away will almost never hit them. A shorter indicator was more representative of the “effective max range.”\n> \n> People are rarely going to be upset if their skill shot hits something that they thought was slightly out of range. In that case, expectations are broken in a positive way, “Oh nice I didn’t expect that root to hit!” They WILL be upset if their spell misses something they expected to hit, “WTF they were in range but the spell didn’t reach them. This indicator lies!”\n> \n> This is further confounded by the fact that most players’ default assumption is that skillshots “cheat” the indicator a bit.  An indicator that is perfectly accurate can often feel as though it’s lying about the true range of the spell, because of EXPECTATIONS.\n\nIf its really all about the expectations, then what do you have to say about most skillshots not having an accurate visual representation that matches their hitbox.
