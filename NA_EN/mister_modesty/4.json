I want to share a concept I&#039;ve been working on for a while. I hope you all like him! \n\n**Hannibal, Conqueror of Armies**\n**Race/Faction:** Shuriman Ascendant (Elephant)\n**Equipment:** Shield and Banner\n**Primary Role:** Juggernaut\n**Secondary Role:** Support\n\n**SKILLS!!!**\n**Passive: Battle Hardened**\n>- Hannibal gains 10% of his maximum Health as bonus Armor.\n\n**Q: Wage War**\n>- **(passive)-** Hannibal gains bonus Movement Speed inside **Battleground**\n- **(active)-** Hannibal swings his banner around him, taunting all enemies struck.\n\n**W: Shuriman Will**\n>- **(active)-** Hannibal takes reduced damage, and his basic attacks deal damage in an AOE for a short time.\n- Damage from AOE will be less than damage from basic attack\n\n**E: Tremendous Charge**\n>- **(passive)-** As Hannibal moves, he builds momentum. At full momentum, Hannibal&#039;s next attack unleashes momentum and knocks back target.\n- **(active)-** Hannibal lunges forward, dealing damage to enemies in his path.\n- **(active)-** At full momentum, Hannibal lunges forward pushing all enemies in his path to target location and knocking them up at the end of the  dash.\n- (basic rules for momentum apply)\n\n**Ultimate: Battleground**\n>- **(passive)-** Allies in **Battleground** gain bonus Cooldown Reduction\n- **(passive)-** Hannibal gains bonus Attack Speed inside **Battleground**\n- **(active)-** Hannibal turns a large area of the map into a **Battleground**, which acts as a &quot;King of the Hill&quot; objective. Inside the **Battleground**, a small area appears that must be captured. Capturing the objective grants bonus team gold, and summons a wave of **Shuriman Minions**.\n- (**Shuriman Minions&#039;s** Health scales off Hannibal&#039;s Maximum Health)\n\n**Kit Breakdown**\n>- **Shuriman Theme:** I wanted this kit to play well with Azir&#039;s kit. Hannibal is basically a military leader, and serves his Emperor diligently. Azir&#039;s kit turns **Battleground** into his own personal playground. \n{{champion:268}} **_I love recess_**\n- **Kit Flow:** Giving Hannibal a taunt played out for two reasons: A- I wanted a tank concept that keeps enemies engaged. B- It plays into the objective of his Ultimate. Hannibal&#039;s W seems a little lack-luster, but with multiple enemies taunted it should play out well. Hannibal&#039;s E also makes plays with the objective of his Ultimate. Being able to push enemies out of the area helps secure the objective, but this mechanic is too simple so I added the momentum condition.\n\n**History**\n>The Shuriman Legacy stood due to many advances, especially military. Hannibal was a great military strategist. Strong, and determined, Hannibal underwent his Ascension with great confidence and sense of honor. With his might, and military sense of mind, Hannibal's armies brought unity to the nation by sweeping out the numerous militias that had always prevailed over Shuriman military. Hannibal greatly admired his Emperor, and devoted his existence to the glory of Shurima under Azir. \nHannibal now wishes to continue his service to the mighty Azir, and comes to the League of Legends to fight for the legacy of Shurima once again.\n\n**Dialogue**\n>- **selection-** \"Honor and Glory for Shurima!\"\n- **movement-** \"Take charge!\" , \"The enemies of Shurima will tremble.\" , \"We must advance.\"\n- **attack-** \"(Trumpets)\" , \"Ha!\"\n- **joke-** \"You know what they say about a big trunk.. (trumpets)\"\n- **taunt-** \"I'll try not to step on you.\" \n{{champion:33}} -_**\"okay\"**_\n","replies":[{"poster":"Beheaded","date":"2017-01-01T08:09:40.919+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Passive should give MAX 2% armor.","replies":[{"poster":"Terakali","date":"2017-01-01T09:26:18.258+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can reliably get to 5000 HP.
