It&#039;s my favorite role. But given the updates with items and champions, Support is just more responsibility with less rewards. \n\nOne of the main concerns Supports face is itemization. I think Riot had the right idea when they incorporated &quot;Ward Builds&quot; for the 3 Support Items. But, we don&#039;t see these items getting a lot of use. The trade-off isn&#039;t rewarding. Supports would rather sacrifice the extra item slot and just get SIghtstone and the original T3 Support Item. What gives? \n\nPersonally, I don&#039;t purchase &quot;Warding Support&quot; items because you sacrifice the active of the original T3 items for the &quot;Warding&quot; active. Why would I choose warding over 2 Icy Ghosts that seek out enemy champions, reveal them, and slow their Movement Speed?\n\nI think I have a solution to this problem, and it involves reworking the &quot;Warding Support&quot; items. Essentially, I think we can do something with the actual wards being placed, based on the type of &quot;Eye&quot; we&#039;re working with. Let me know what you think. \n\n{{item:2303}} **Eye of the Equinox**\n>**Unique Active: Equinox Ward-** Places a Stealth Ward that reveals the area for 150 seconds, and grants nearby Allies a shield equal to 10% of your max Health for 3 seconds every 15 seconds.\n\n{{item:2302}} **Eye of the Oasis**\n>**Unique Active: Oasis Ward-** Places a Stealth Ward that reveals the area for 150 seconds, and grants nearby Allies +40% Movement Speed for 3 seconds every 15 seconds.\n\n{{item:2301}} **Eye of the Watchers**\n>**Unique Active: Watchers Ward-** Places a Stealth Ward that reveals the area for 150 seconds, and summons an Icy Ghost for 3 seconds every 15 seconds. Icy Ghosts seek out enemy Champions, reveal them upon contact, and reduce their Movement Speed by 25% for 3 seconds.\n\nI hope everyone can get on board with unique wards. I think carrying over the actives for the original T3 Support items into a ward mechanic could be very rewarding for the entire team, and give the Support the satisfaction that their items are making a real impact. This should also encourage Supports to place wards strategically, and more often. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read this concept. I look forward to the feedback.","replies":[{"poster":"Mister Modesty","date":"2016-10-29T21:26:37.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like some non-support players are dropping their hurt butts all over Boards.

Lol.\n\nWell, I tried to nerf the effects from the original T3 items to create a trade-off. But I see your point. However, nobody really grabs the \"eye\" builds as support. They typically take the original T3 and a sightstone.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rioyter","date":"2016-10-29T22:02:33.498+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its a really good idea, but items for supports get a change anyways and if you see that there is a icy ghost spawning, you know that there is a ward and its not stealthy enough.\nBut different types of ward would be nice: \n**Shield** one if you want to be save in lane\n**Ghost** one if you want to be save from ganks\n**Speed** one if you want to get ganks","replies":[{"poster":"Mister Modesty","date":"2016-10-29T22:10:37.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just used the actives from the original T3 items.
