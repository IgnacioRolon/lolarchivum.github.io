After a short time I found myself playing the game more often because it WAS a good game. The community wasn't toxic, and you were allowed to joke around with players without there being issues. \r\n\r\nBy Season 5 many new players joined the scene and the game just started deteriorating. This is when I created a Boards account, to try and have a voice to save the game I love. But that was a dead end because the toxic changes I saw in the community had already infected the Boards. \r\n\r\nI watched as newer and newer players joined the game- making demands for changes because they didn't like how everything worked. And RIOT caved- again, and again, and again. \r\n\r\nBy Season 6 I had to relearn the game 3 times already from the changes. Masteries kept changing, the Jungle was no longer the same, the community became a tumor that doesn't stop growing. And now it's at the point you can't even speak up against trolling because everything's a reportable offense. If the word \"noob\" is a reportable offense in an online video game, there's a serious problem with the way the game is being run.\r\n\r\nI'm not a wealthy person, and it's not like I've spent thousands of dollars- but this is not the game I invested in. The largest insult was when I bought a $100 RP card from Walmart, and redeemed the card- just for a serious update to once again change the entire face of the game. \r\n\r\nI want my money back. Plain and simple. Riot has no concern for its more seasoned players and continues to insult us with these insistent changes- changes being being made to make the game more \"suitable\" for a new player base. It's like being recycled. I gave this company money so they could MAINTAIN the game- not fucking ruin it. \r\n\r\nIf you feel like I do- and you're sick of these changes, I hope you can support me in this. I hope we can all stand together against this embezzlement of human resource, and that we can all get the refund we deserve.","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2018-01-05T05:23:03.520+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sucks to hear you're not happy with the current state of the game and how it's changed lately. Personally I've found that a lot of QOL and mechanics changes have made my gameplay much more interesting since S 4, but I can agree that as a Jungler I'm always fearful that a new Season will mean I have to relearn basically everything and a couple new Champs.\n\nBut neither of us are everyone. There will always be differences in opinion, and the nature of an online game, especially a MOBA like League, is one of constant evolution. While I'd be happy to discuss feedback about those changes to a degree, be they related to mechanics or how we manage negative Behavior, this section is not the place for that. Further, I can't grant you a full refund on all your purchases made in LoL; there are limitations on what we can refund you and they are not often cash refunds.\n\nFor an outline on what we can do with refunds, I implore you to check up our [**Refunds FAQ over here**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751864) for details on those rules or to [**ticket our Billing Support team in private**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new ) if you have more questions that aren't answered there. As for the changes you're concerned about, I _really really_ want you to post any feedback you have where it has a good chance of being seen by developers, whether it be for [**gameplay**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance) or for [**Player Behavior**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation). In the end, I know this isn't exactly what you want to hear, but while a full refund is not feasible voicing your concerns for the game is, and very valuable to all of us. Especially those in charge of how it grows!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2018-01-05T06:12:24.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not a wealthy person either, and yet I own every champion, every skin currently available to purchase, and currently every emote available, along with hundreds of icons. My chroma collection only started with the release of the Blue Essence store during preseason, as those were never a focus for me to purchase with RP. They were all obtained over multiple years, and it was a conscious decision I made over the many other things I could have purchased. \n\nI still use the same press board desk that I first sat at when I was first allowed on the computer as a child. I've used the same chair that was discarded by a company over half a decade ago, a chair that was old, used and being replaced, and would have been in the trash if they didn't allow me to have it. I could have an executive desk and chair and upgrade my desktop almost two fold for the amount I've spent, but I didn't spend that money all at once, and likely wouldn't have spent it on those things anyways.\n\nLife is a long and constant series of choices. You made you choices. Now you have to learn to live with it. You can't expect everything to stay the same, and for all we know, League can disappear entirely some day. Nothing lasts forever, and we shouldn't expect it to.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mister Modesty","date":"2018-01-05T04:11:36.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]}]}
