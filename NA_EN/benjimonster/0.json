So however you want to boil it down, that's the first thing you posted on this thread. You can refer to it as hypothetical and say that it has no hypothetical basis all day, but that doesn't really make sense. Or if it was just my own fabrication then what IS the different story? Is the different story that I brought up a valid point regardless of this petty nonsense about how hypothetical a situation is? Could it possibly be BOTH? NOOO, based on a chat log of mine that you will never see as well as based on other people's experiences AND my own common sense and vision of how things work? I don't know, I think we'd better just make everything black and white for the sake of argument.\n> \n> The point is you threw away my original post as invalid immediately by backing up an insulting comment with your 'clarification' that was clearly not needed by anybody. \n> \n> You continue to defend Slumberjack which leads me to the conclusion that you just wanted to butt in to support the riot employee and berate the other guy by acting high and mighty. You can construe this as an insult. \n> \n\nWell, hypothetical are great and all, but we are talking about a huge system that has been running for some time. So I think we are past the point of hypothetical. So people, including riot, want something tangible. Your hypothesis is just that a hypothesis. It's not unreasonable to ask for something to support it. Anyone can hypothesis anything.\n\nSlumber Jacks post could have been improved by a warn personal touch, sure. But its a neutral post. He asked you a question that it. Why you seem to have taken that has a personal attack is beyond me.\n\n> Warnings aren't meaningless, it's  a way to tell you that you've been reported a lot, and if you've been reported a lot you're more likely to be punished. How is that meaningless?\n\nThey are an indicator that you have been reported a lot but getting warned and getting punished are very different things. To be punished you have to have been reported a lot. But because you are reported a lot does not mean that you will be punished.\n\nReports do 2 things. Trigger warnings and trigger evaluation of your chat. If there is nothing there it doesn't matter how many trolls reported you. If there is something there it doesn't matter that the source of the report was a troll.\n\nYou might want to take a step back and read this thread again. You are taking neutral comments as slights and let it derail the conversation. If you are doing that in game then it is no wonder your experience is what you claim it to be. Your team isn't you + 4 random people, its just 5 random people. You influence how those groups behave as well.

I never said it wasn't hypothetical. I never *implied* it wasn't hypothetical. I referred to it over and over again as a hypothetical situation.\n\nSo what, exactly, have I done to indicate that I believe it to be anything other than a hypothetical?\n\n>  Also  if you think Slumberjack was trying to be genuinely helpful I suggest you look further into what people say. He's clearly being a dick to me and for no reason by assuming that I have warnings because of my chat logs that he dares me to post publicly. It's pretty insulting really as well as pretentious in assuming that their report system is so flawless that I couldn't get a warning without deserving it.\n\nThat's certainly one possible interpretation. Another is that he's asking for validation of your claims, in an effort to either a) determine if action needs to be taken, or b) help clarify your situation.\n\nAlso, as I've noted elsewhere in your thread, warnings are not vetted by the system, because they're essentially meaningless. So they don't come with chat logs. Which is why I suspect his statement was contingent upon the premise of falsely issued chat restrictions.\n\n> I mean if I were trying to properly represent the company I worked for I would approach a customer with something more like: \"I'm sorry you've had an unfortunate experience with our reporting system, please feel free to email ______ or file a ticket at _____ and we will look in to your issues further.\" Rather than say anything that could be remotely construed as insulting. \n\nFrankly, there's no way to say *anything* that cannot conceivably construed as an insult. I know *at least* three people that would construe your proposed statement as an insult.\n\n> Isn't almost half the voters saying they have been wrongfully warned or restricted enough evidence to support a hypothesis?\n\nWarnings are meaningless - they're entirely disconnected from **everything** other than reports. So, no. They don't support your hypothesis, because they don't have anything to do with the system your hypothesis relates to.\n\nAs for the rest: I'm not trying to debate or discuss your hypothesis here. I never was. Nothing I've said here has related to your hypothesis itself in any way. And I'm not going to start doing so this far down the nesting line.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Budupops","date":"2015-10-23T20:39:23.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"gibe the chatlogs pls","replies":[]},{"poster":"PDE5 Inhibitors","date":"2015-10-23T00:57:11.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How does one...share their chat logs?

Trolls are people who intentionally ruin the game for you for the fun of it.  \n\nIf people mess up and start to rage out, *don't* treat them like a troll.  That only makes things worse.  If all you say is \"It's ok man, people make mistakes.  If we start to play smart and ward we can come back.\" then you will find a lot of people will shut up and just try to work on their mistakes.

You have to be getting valid reports in a lot of your games for that to happen, which means you are either wording things in a bad way and people are misconstruing you, or you are saying toxic things.  Both of which can be fixed.\n\nI've been playing this game for 4 years now and I have seen the worst that this community can offer.  I have never once been informed that I have been reported or that I was in danger of Chat Restriction.  In fact, I had the teamwork honor badge for 2 years until one DC in an ARAM got me reported and it taken away.  I'm sure that I have been reported by Trolls and upset people plenty of times, but since I don't type anything toxic, nothing happens.\n\n> \n> You act like a system made up of rules and numbers with no human interaction can determine if a report is valid or not, it can't and it doesn't.\n\nThe only thing that is automated is the Chat scanning system.  It's pretty easy to just not type toxic things at people. And if you get reported for verbal abuse/offensive language, it's pretty easy to scan the chat logs and see if a report is valid based on words used.\n\n> \n> In what part of my post did you gather that I call people out on their bad plays or that I say what people should have done or call a surrender vote Or call somebody else to be reported?\n\nSorry, I didn't mean for it to seem like I was saying that you did those things, but meant them as examples of area's you shouldn't really chat about, in general.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FromTXwithLove","date":"2015-10-23T03:23:49.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Benjimonster,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=iRl645hX,comment-id=00040001,timestamp=2015-10-23T00:58:44.931+0000)\n\n> You act like a system made up of rules and numbers with no human interaction can determine if a report is valid or not, it can't and it doesn't.\n\nYeah, sorry but that's just wrong.

From your very first post all you were doing is trolling. You aren't helping progress the conversation you're just antagonizing me. \n\nYou asked a question: \"What do my personal chat logs have to do with a hypothetical situation meant to point out the flaws in the reporting system?\"\n\nI provided a possible answer to that question. Since then, all I've done is defend my statements and myself, while you've insulted me.\n\n> You said if I don't provide a chat log that proves that somebody was wrongfully warned or restricted that my hypothesis has no basis.\n\nThat's explicitly **not** what I said at all. At no point did I say that.\n\nI did, however, say that it's not unreasonable for a person to assume that chat logs showing wrongful restrictions might be the basis for your hypothesis. I also said there might also be a *different* basis. Either way, if your audience is seeking to validate your hypothesis, that's a **good thing**.\n\n> So however you want to boil it down, that's the first thing you posted on this thread. You can refer to it as hypothetical and say that it has no hypothetical basis all day, but that doesn't really make sense.\n\nThe first thing I posted on this thread? Let's look over that, paragraph by paragraph:\n\n\"*One would presume that your hypothetical is based on some kind of information. One might then recognize the most likely form for that information to take would be a chat restriction - either your own or someone else's - that is believed to be false.*\"\n\nHere, I posit an assumption, and indicate how that assumption could logically lead someone to believing that your hypothesis is based on someone's presumably-invalid chat logs.\n\n\"*Establishing the validity of that chat restriction would then either a) remove the basis for the hypothesis, or b) support the basis for the hypothesis.*\"\n\nHere, I note the importance of validating hypotheses. As I pointed out earlier, merely accepting every hypothesis that's presented to you without objectively verifiable evidence has a lot of silly potential.\n\n\"*Of course, if this concept was created whole cloth, with no basis other than your own pre-conceived notions, that's an entirely different story.*\"\n\nHere, I indicate that, for any situation in which the assumptions in my first paragraph are false **negates the rest of that post**. The language is pretty clear, I think. I'm not sure why you're so keen to interpret everything in the worst conceivable light.\n\n> The point is you threw away my original post as invalid immediately by backing up an insulting comment with your 'clarification' that was clearly not needed by anybody. \n\nIt seems to me that a person asking a question may well need clarification. If that's not the case, I kindly invite you to indicate to me how one should be expected to recognize that based solely on the question itself.\n\n> You continue to defend Slumberjack which leads me to the conclusion that you just wanted to butt in to support the riot employee and berate the other guy by acting high and mighty. You can construe this as an insult. \n\nI'm not defending Slumberjack. I'm merely pointing out my interpretation of his statement. Because that's my opinion. Are you saying that any opinion other than yours is an insult to you?\n\n> Warnings aren't meaningless, it's  a way to tell you that you've been reported a lot, and if you've been reported a lot you're more likely to be punished. How is that meaningless?\n\nWarnings are not an indicator of how likely you are to be punished. Players who receive warnings are *not* necessarily more likely to be punished. Moreover, warnings **are not** connected to the Instant Feedback system (this would be the system that actually handles case review and punishment).\n\nSince your hypothesis is that the Instant Feedback system is flawed, and warnings have **exactly** zero connection to that system, they cannot be considered to be meaningful in relation to your hypothesis.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeynaTaggerung","date":"2015-10-23T03:08:56.998+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's no way you got a chat restriction off of purely unfair reports.
