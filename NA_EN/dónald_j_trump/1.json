General Mattis is already making moves as Secretary of State, merking the shit out of terrorists with our arsenal of badassery like A-10C Warthogs. America needed a wake up call and it couldn&#039;t have come at a better time.\r\n\r\nThe sad thing is the people embarrassing our nation by mass protesting for causes they aren&#039;t even sure of, and celebrities like Madonna literally stating she would like to see the White House destroyed. Combine this with B list celebrity comedians and &quot;personalities&quot; making fun of Trump&#039;s ten year old son on social media (who either way did nothing to fucking anyone and should be left alone) and the true colors show through. The left was so sure their corrupt candidate would win that they just cannot accept the crushing defeat.\r\n\r\nhttp://imgc.allpostersimages.com/images/P-473-488-90/13/1370/GRRS000Z/posters/joseph-sohm-bald-eagle-and-american-flag.jpg","replies":[]}
