Bugsplats are rarely caused by this, however, because your bugsplat occurs right when a transition to our login series is supposed to happen, this may be the case. I strongly recommend working through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) in order to ensure that you aren't running a problematic network configuration that could cause issues reaching our servers.\n\nLet me know if this helped.","replies":[]}]}
