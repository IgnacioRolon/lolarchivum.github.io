The Jurassic ones I guess are exceptions due to them being less humanoid. Honestly they probably forced this design just to make a kled skin because there's not a lot they can do besides super galaxy (skin line wasn't that long ago, too soon for another) and likely future events they have planned kled wouldn't fit in.
