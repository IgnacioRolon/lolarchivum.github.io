Before we look at Yasuo specific changes though we want to look at Warlord's Bloodlust, see whether we need to adjust that first and if so what spot Trynd/Yasuo end up in, given they'll be better placed than almost any other champion to take advantage of that mastery.\n\nThis seems to be an an overarching problem with the new Masteries in general (although it's especially visible with the left tree)--some champs can just optimize the hodge-podge of stats and effects of the keystones way better than anyone else. \n\nChamps like Yasuo and Tryndamere will always benefit more from Warlord's Bloodlust since they already really like crazy in-fight heals and crit more often than other champions with identical builds, Kog'Maw will always benefit the most from Fervor of Battle since he can attack twice as quickly as other champs (and the damage reduction doesn't affect on-hit), and so on. At least with items, this super synergistic power must be earned through action, rather than clicking a thing during champ select. \n\nHaving these Keystone Masteries overlap with the items system and the design team's spoken intent of having them reinforce what a champion is already set up to do rather than giving them strategic options makes the Masteries rework a bit redundant on multiple levels (even though it's by and far more satisfying than the previous iteration). Especially for damage-dealing champions, I don't see why it would ever be an actual option to go for any Keystone aside from the one they can optimize the most. On top of that, since many of them are % increases to purchased stats (Unyielding, Meditation, Sorcery, etc.), they tend to predetermine which stats a champion will be favoring before they even get to the loading screen, and since they don't really provide anything that the item system already doesn't (role-defining stats and effects), I'm not sure why the entire system exists in the first place.\n\nI'm hoping it doesn't cause too many problems in the future, but the way it was designed and executed, I can't have much faith that it won't.","replies":[]},{"poster":"laststanding6","date":"2015-11-12T09:37:44.399+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I apologize for being rude but can you please answer my question?

Though I do agree with you that hsi crit damage is not only too high, but it also stops him from buying other great items. \n\nMy solution is to slightly reduce the crit damage, and then give him a passive that increases his crit damage by 5% for every 25% (50% on Yasuo) crit that he gets over 100% crit chance. \n\nThat means that at 200% crit chance, Yasuo does 90% damage, instead of his reduced 80%.\n\nThat does 2 things. It gives him some early game damage back without letting him be too oppresive with crit, and gives him a reason to buy crit items after he has reached his cap already.","replies":[{"poster":"Valexfor","date":"2015-11-12T17:23:14.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That still wouldn't be a solution since Yasuo should be considerate an \"hypercarry\", and as much as I hate him I can't say he doesn't do his job, in fact he does it so well that he's not even an hypercarry, but a perfect carry.\nAn hypercarry (like vayne, kog, azir) is a champion with a particularly weak early game, but an extremely powerful (often times almost unstoppable) late game. Yasuo's problem is: he's got the late-game power of an hypercarry, but also the safety of a tank (his shield is incredibly strong), the moility of an assassin (his e) and the damage of a lane bully (he's got good base damage that become even better with his crits). This is the problem, even if you do manage to counter him, he will scale no matter what thanks to the passive, and still be relevant thanks to his good/strong base damage (which again become better with the passive) and the armor pen on the ult.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
