Old Malz was before they ever reworked him in the first place and I could go spell vamp masteries and quints, drop my E on a wave, and basically always have a health pot on, the mana gain from a ring and his E was enough for sustain, and his base stats were high enough I could 1v3 push to inhib turret without going B.\n\nThen you buy whatever items you wanted. One time I built an infinity edge and static shiv on my first B, and I only went B because our Wukong kept bugging me about it XD Of course, AP was best on him though, I just did that because we were so far ahead.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"YoeMadBro","date":"2017-08-12T10:27:07.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BestJhinUniverse,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PLX8r4jl,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-08-12T10:25:42.246+0000)\n>\n> All of em.
