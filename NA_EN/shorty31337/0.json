Why are words more important to riot than skill is. Fix your game.\n\nSo I'll address both of these points, which aren't really related.\n---------------------------\n\n##Why is so much of the League community toxic?\nThis is likely a confirmation bias. Humans tend to remember negative interactions more than positive ones, so even a handful of bad players over an evening of gaming can make you feel EVERYONE was toxic. Additionally, there are many good players who simply don't communicate much -- something I've found out over several years now of going out of my way to encourage positive team communication. You can get a lot of people talking and being civil or outright friendly, but those who go out of their way to dominate chat are often those either super frustrated, or those intentionally trying to ruin another's experience.\n\n----------------------------------\n\n##Why does Riot care more about toxicity than skill, and why can't you just mute a toxic player?\nFirst off, there's no rule you can't be bad at League -- skill IS important, but the MMR system exists to get players to their approximate skill level. Everyone has bad games, and everyone has new champions: League is supposed to be a game anyone can play, and that means you have to allow bad players. Bad players don't ruin games any more than a decent player having a really bad day, and they'll quickly fall down to their proper MMR level. Remember -- if you matched with them, you're probably around that MMR range as well. Maybe they really ARE just having a bad day.\n\nOn why toxic players are punished? Because some games you win, and some you lose -- even if it's due to a bad player. But a toxic player makes EVERY game they're in worse, even when they're playing the best on their team. They hurt the perception of the community, not just the outcome of a game, and often they go out of their way to intentionally create an unfriendly, unwelcoming environment.\n\nNow, yes -- you can mute them. But the mute button is the shield AGAINST toxicity, not a justification FOR it. It's in place to make sure that, if you encounter a toxic player, you have a recourse other than listening to them flame you. It is NOT put in place to ALLOW toxicity. There's an important distinction.","replies":[]},{"poster":"robinhhhood","date":"2017-05-03T21:31:02.223+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Observe how the community giddily rushes to this thread to try to deflect blame onto the OP.\n\nRiot is refusing to admit that this game shelters a culture of self-victimization.\n\nIt's funny because I am actually keeping track of how many posts are being made about players attempting to \"Play the Victim\" as a way to abuse others in chat.\n\nI have observed 9 threads about this problem in the past 16 hours.
