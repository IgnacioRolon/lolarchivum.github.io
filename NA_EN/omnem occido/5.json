So, how do we make it so that supports are unique unto themselves, and how do we give them power they deserve if they&#039;ve earned the gold for it?\r\nEnter Celestial Power. Basically, it&#039;s a stat that utility, heal, and cc will scale with (if the champion has the scaling in their abilities to begin with). So, for example, let&#039;s take a champion like Janna. Janna&#039;s Q will remain an AP scaling (as it is all magic damage scaling), but now her W&#039;s bonus Movement Speed, as well as the active slow scaling, will rely on her Celestial Power, so will her E&#039;s damage mitigation and Attack Damage buff scaling, and her ult&#039;s heal over time scaling.\r\nThis will allow for stronger scaling without providing AP magic damage users other item options, allowing supports to have an item set completely unique unto themselves. Tank supports will obviously benefit less from this, but even then, their scaling has never really suffered.\r\n\r\nIf this idea is well received, I might consider going through every champion and outlining how this change would affect ability stats.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-11-27T16:33:19.580+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's kinda the same reason AD scaling were introduced in the first place too. At the very beginning, every ability scaled with AP, no matter what. Then they realized it would be much easier to balance items around some sub-set of champs, and so it led to AD versus AP champs, and later to some champs even having scaling based on their Armor/MR/HP, like Voli or Malphite or Leona.\n\nThat being said, making this change at this point in time would be a huge disruption, and I'm not sure the benefit would be worth the cost of the disruption. You basically need to rework at least a dozen items and around 20 champs all together, and probably every single AP champ in the long run.\n\nJust for the fun of toying with ideas, how would you go about champs like Lulu/Morga/Zyra, that can be played either full AP and deal respectable damage or Support? If you make their utility scale with UP and their damage with AP, they will deal literally no meaningful damage when built Support, and they will have gutted utility when built AP, so they won't ever compete with \"true\" Mid champs that always have some baseline utility.","replies":[{"poster":"Siegfriedx2","date":"2016-11-27T16:57:36.231+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hybrid scaling.
