I feel like somewhere on the internet a Rioter has posted a list of unofficial rules that people should follow, but it's really pretty simple. My unofficial list of rules is in the window that comes up when reporting someone in-game. Other than a few, such as \"Unskilled player,\" most of those are punishable offences and should be avoided.","replies":[{"poster":"Omnem Occido","date":"2015-01-13T18:20:36.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's what I mean though. There ought to be a written out code of conduct with maybe a board to discuss the way certain rulings should be upheld, like what constitutes a chat restriction or a game ban.
