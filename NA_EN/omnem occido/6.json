For instance, for those of you who don't know, the United States' National Collegiate Athletic Association just held their American college football championship in Dallas, Texas. On the 1st of February, the US's National Football League will be holding the Superbowl, their championship game. It would be cool if you guys made an American football set. I know it doesn't have as much following outside the US, but it is nigh a religion here in the States.\r\nAlso, I wouldn't mind a full set for basketball (Beyond the Arc Ziggs, Hard in the Paint Lee Sin, etc.), or a baseball/softball set (Fireball Brand, Golden Glove Ahri, etc.)","replies":[{"poster":"Zahz","date":"2015-01-14T21:28:48.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know it would never happen but maybe a Lacrosse Leblanc, Heavyweight Champ Vi, Sumo Gragas, Derbyhorse Hecarim, \n\nWhat about Little League Yorick  and all his ghouls come out as little leaguers","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlackSunNocturne","date":"2015-01-13T20:17:37.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ray Allen {{champion:101}} \nThe Three-Pointers\n\nDodgeball {{champion:134}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-01-13T18:47:05.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The sport skins would be better if it's something that everybody around the world knows and at least know the basics about how to play.\n\nIt's not like nobody knows about American football though I personally can't see why not, but something more international would always add some extra pluses if you get what I mean.","replies":[{"poster":"Omnem Occido","date":"2015-01-13T19:31:51.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes and no.

As big as it is in North America, it isn't all that popular outside the continent. Try selling a gridiron skin to a LoL player in China or Poland. Probably won't do too well.","replies":[{"poster":"Omnem Occido","date":"2015-01-13T19:27:14.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, but you market to the demographics that will buy the best. If you want to release a skin set for American football, you will make boatloads of money in the American market. If you made something else, like a skin that relates to Chinese culture, guaranteed you will make more from the Chinese than you would any other market. Regional marketing is a major money maker in multinational business. That's why you will never see a McAloo in an American McDonald's, but in India, it's a number one seller.","replies":[]}]}]}
