The implications of the battles won reverberated throughout the lore, and so many characters have their background in the war. The thing is, things have changed. There is no Institute of War anymore. Battles may still be fought on the Rift, but their importance is unclear, and their effect on the lore seems to lack any connection.\r\nThere are so many story lines to weave together. From Lee Sin, Master Yi, Karma, and Irelia rising to become great warriors and leaders, to the impact of the celestial forces made by Bard and Soraka, the rise of the Kinkou Order with Kennen, Shen, and Akali,  the fall of the order at the hands of Zed, the corruption of Varus, the ascendance of Syndra, the training of Wukong in the ways of Wuju, the subduing of Udyr&#039;s primal rage, and the dishonoring of Yasuo. Even the effects on the Noxians are palpable: Riven revoking her allegiance to Noxus in hopes of finding a way to bring Noxus back into power, Swain&#039;s grand schemes that led to the start of the war, with his lapdog Darius, and Singed&#039;s villainy being realized in his ruthless use of chemical warfare. \r\nThe story has such a large and profound impact on Runeterra, and now that much of what was carried out within the war no longer has that glue that was the Institute of War, we are left with a smattering of stories with no real cohesive means to an ending. Thus, I ask for a revisiting of the main story of the war. Maybe it continues to this day, maybe it ends at some point. The potential for this being the next long-term story arc, like Burning Tides + 2015 Harrowing, goes on and on. A whole years worth of story could be told about this war, maybe even more. Either way, I would be personally excited about a new story, and new twists on the Ionian-Noxian War.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2015-12-22T03:59:06.873+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"It really needs a relook if only so we can figure out how the sod it plays out in the new canon with any degree of certainty.

I mean, we have little idea how Targon is like, even less about what Shurima is like, and even less about the Yordles and Bandle City. So, I would assume that Noxus hasn't even begun to invade Ionia until a rioter says otherwise. Rito has a lot of things to patch up, hopefully they've gained some momentum from the Bilgewater event (Which was excellent) and begin to pump this stuff out faster and faster so we can get to the juicy stuff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2015-12-22T12:36:16.022+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of the problems is that there are so many places that they have yet to cover that it's unlikely they will go back over anything they've already done no matter how long ago it was. I really want them to do expand on the Ionia lore, especially since I main an Ionian champ who has about 3 thing in his lore that say anything about him right now.

There are so many questions in his lore left unanswered. \nWhat exactly was the Runestone that made him? \nIs he still from the Plegas Jungles and if he is, how did he manage to reach an Island on the other end of the continent without meeting ONE human? \nIf there is no League of legends, how does Master Yi convince Wukong to learn Wuju in the first place? \nWouldn't he just constantly be wondering around for stronger opponents, technically making him independent rather than aligned with Ionia?\nWhy is he friends with Ahri?\nDoes he have any kind of interaction with/ knowledge of the other Ionian champs?\nAre they even aware of his existence?\nwho are these talking monkeys that created him from the Runestone?\n \nAs he sits, he's just a random monkey apprentice to {{champion:11}}, forever training in Wuju and never having any significant impact to the lore.

The way they actively settled Graves' and Twisted Fate's lore, kicked up Miss Fortune's effectiveness and deposed of Gangplank, all the while setting up for the Harrowing, even giving Olaf a brief cameo, and then setting up Illaoi's release, this was the most interactive and enjoyable developments of lore I have ever seen.\nImagine, a settling of Yasuo's search as he confronts Riven, or a twist in Syndra's story where she becomes the greatest traitor in Ionia's cause, siding with Noxus in an effort to gain increased autonomy and freedom, or how Soraka, who was largely not mention in the original war storyline, is the major proponent of non-violence, while the 4 Heros of Ionia, Lee Sin, Karma, Irelia, and Master Yi choose the middle ground between peace and violence. Think also of the effects the corruption has on Varus. Does it spread out from his influence and affect those around them, forcing him to live alone as a hermit? Where do these champions belong?
