Got a new MacBook with a AMD 460 and 4gb of VRAM thinking i'd see even more improvements. Instead I see decent frame rates in the corner but the game plays like it's running at 5-10fps for some reason. Literally unplayable even tho its showing a decent frame rate and this is anytime, even at the beginning of the game when nothing is happening. When I installed an app to force using the integrated graphics tho, it went back to running at least in a way I could manage to play again for the short time I jumped into a Practice Tool game. \r\n\r\nAm I doing something that is making League only run well on integrated graphics in OSX? So confused by this, should be able to run this game on a toaster but a laptop over 2 grand can't seem to cut it. I know it's Apple but come on lol","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-10T21:03:37.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those low frames might be caused by some weird interactions between league and some unique Mac settings. Let's try adjusting some of those to see if that pumps your fps back up.\n\n- Open up your System Preferences, head into Accessibility (little blue icon with 2 people on it).\n- From the Vision Menu, click on \"Display\" and disable \"Shake Mouse Pointer to Locate\"\n- From the Interacting Menu, click on \"Mouse & Trackpad\" and toggle \"Ignore built-in trackpad when...\"\n\nLet me know how that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Johr Dinh","date":"2017-04-11T05:34:22.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope still has that super stuttery low FPS look and feel. Only way I can get it to play decent is by using VSync which i've never used and is usually regarded as taboo for gaming. Playable even during teamfights, tho all my actions feel like they're just slightly behind my clicks, but playable I guess. This is blowing my mind that a supped up video card has issues while integrated graphics plays buttery smooth lol","replies":[]}]}]}
