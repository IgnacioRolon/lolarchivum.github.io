There are 2 of them that I would say are interchangeable with an actual tank right now, Cho'Gath because that's just his intended role I guess now, and Volibear because he's trash and has no incentive to buy damage.\n\nThe difference is in their function, and unless you're doing an off-build Sion will be picked primarily for his crowd control, where most juggernauts will emphasize damage or at have the THREAT of high damage (Cho'Gath again), and their crowd control is meant to help themselves more than it is their team. \n\n> Darius is the only Juggernaut currently that functions well as one\n\nDisagree. In 7.14 I think there are several viable and strong choices. {{champion:31}} {{champion:83}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:27}} The first two I think might actually be stronger than Darius right now; Singed definitely is. Mordekaiser is plenty strong, too. Nasus may come out of the next patch in VERY good shape as the late game carry of his subclass. I think that Illaoi is underperforming right now but that's more a result of other champs and Bramble Vest being OP\n\nTo me, the biggest problem with Juggernauts is two-fold. One, a lot of them are still archaic champions who have aged poorly; Shyvana, Udyr, Nasus, VOLIBEAR, etc. They've been fixing this with small changes, we've seen that progress and we see more of it with Nasus on PBE right now, but it's still an issue. Two, their main competition, the Divers, are still very generic and generalist; as a result, they tend to share a lot of the same strength profiles, but with mobility attached and for some reason, usually much more hard CC. We should be seeing more work on these champions soon, though, so hopefully they move a little further away from one another.\n\nsorry, i wrote more than i thought xd ","replies":[{"poster":"Brascus","date":"2017-07-14T21:34:37.922+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know much about {{champion:83}} {{champion:27}} but for Garen he has no sticking power like Darius, he only does damage if you build it or are attacking a villain, Darius does decent damage regardless of his build where he can legitimately pick ramp or burst.

Yorick is definitely a juggernaut. But the whole deal of them having immobile in themes of MS is false for some juggs. Juggs like Garen and Udyr like to run up and beat the crap out of anyone that they see, Darius on the other hand doesn't have sticking power, but he does have better lockdown power than Garen due to his E-W combo.\n\nBut since you have already done half of my job, allow me to properly define what a juggernaut champion is:\n\n_Juggernaugts are the titans of the rift, capable to dealing colossal amounts of damage while also being hard to kill due to their durability and sustain. Juggernauts are further divided into two groups. Freight trains, who in a burst of speed will charge that their target and chip away of their health at an alarming rate with rapid attacks. And Raid bosses, who lack the means to sprint but are a slow moving beast that will kill nearly anyone that comes too close to them or is out of position._\n\nTraits both share.\n\n* High damage and tankiness\n* Sustain of various degrees.\n* Predictable.\n* Vulnerable to kiting.\n\nExclusive to Freight trains:\n\n* AA and AS focused (Garen is the exception but he deals rapid damage with his Spin)\n* Can gain a burst of MS to mitigate their weakness to kite.\n* Most have Decent AoE damage\n* Better at engaging/ganking and can even get past the backline if they are lucky.\n\nExclusive to Raid Bosses:\n\n* Some ranged abilities.\n* Some utility. ({{champion:122}} ,{{champion:83}}  and {{champion:75}} can peel decently)\n* Conditional damage, once they have fulfilled that condition their damage skyrockets.\n* Better CC than Freight Trains.\n\nAnyway that is how I would categorize Juggernauts based on my own experience of them.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2017-07-14T18:26:13.955+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1061/1924/products/Thinking_Face_Emoji_grande.png?v=1480481060[/img]","replies":[]},{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2017-07-14T18:50:02.394+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":4,"body":"Because ~~power levels~~ classes are bullsh*t.","replies":[{"poster":"Danjeng","date":"2017-07-14T20:15:59.484+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're just jealous of the Vanguards class, since you're a Warden.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-07-14T17:58:02.108+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"Because Riot doesn't use champion titles to reflect classes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FantasySniper","date":"2017-07-15T04:36:08.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://werenothavingababy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Lances-Rants-GrindsMyGears-Labels.png","replies":[{"poster":"TimX24968B","date":"2017-07-15T06:12:14.867+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know what REALLY GRINDS MY GEARS?\nWHEN THEY SPIN THE SAME DIRECTION","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Faie","date":"2017-07-14T18:56:24.923+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is the green land called Iceland and the ice land called Greenland?","replies":[{"poster":"AwesomeGuyDj","date":"2017-07-14T21:34:28.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Greenland was named that at the time, because even though its icy, it was greener then the surrounding area i believe.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-07-14T22:05:45.123+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually it was to trick other people to stay off Iceland.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2017-07-15T00:37:53.892+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why do we cook bacon and bake cookies?","replies":[{"poster":"THE D1C","date":"2017-07-15T02:20:28.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jokes on you, baked bacon is the best bacon on a cheeseburger","replies":[{"poster":"gabetheguy","date":"2017-07-15T03:40:10.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=THE D1C,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vFBG3pgw,comment-id=00210000,timestamp=2017-07-15T02:20:28.445+0000)\n>\n> Jokes on you, baked bacon is the best bacon on a cheeseburger\n\nwhat the fuck is baked bacon????","replies":[{"poster":"THE D1C","date":"2017-07-15T11:24:41.472+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've never baked bacon in the oven with a little maple/brown sugar sprinkled on it?","replies":[{"poster":"gameipedia","date":"2017-07-15T17:10:14.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just microwave that shit lol, just lay paper towel over and make sure it wont stick to the sugar","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
