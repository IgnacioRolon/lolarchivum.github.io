It's been around since April at least. I personally reported it on Reddit's mega thread multiple times, with other major FPS Freezing bugs, and not a single response even though it was upvoted 20+ times. A single response goes a long way.\n\nThe other bugs I've encountered that impact performance are: Sion when he dies in his passive, has a quick freeze. Ryze when he casts his ultimate (which also moves camera to where Ryze is and then scrolls to where he is teleporting to for some reason? It's very disorienting when it happens) causes another quick freeze. Yasuo in general causes FPS drops especially in teamfights in games that starts 25-30 minutes into the game so I assume it's a memory leak? This has been happening just as long as Jayce, if not longer.\n\nThis isn't to say I'm not appreciative of this finally being addressed, I definitely am, but the simple question here is \"why did this take so long?\" and why hasn't it even been acknowledged by Riot? I know you don't really want to promote bugs to be abused in games, but leaving it alone (Jayce for example which is April at least..) that's a lot of months of no answers, and impacted games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrTiltYourGirl","date":"2016-10-22T18:23:33.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LtRandolph,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=3zmnaXpZ,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2016-10-14T20:01:17.792+0000)\n>\n> This one was quite a journey.
