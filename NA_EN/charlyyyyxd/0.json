It's a different community at Challenger level, to be sure. Challengers do shit that would appear as \"trolling\" to people not at their level, and I just don't think the other Challengers care that much. Meteos getting rip-roaring drunk and throwing a couple games isn't some sort of scandal. \n\nI mean, look at Dyrus. Dyrus has been doing an A-Z alphabetical marathon of every champ, taking them top lane. And he's NOT performing well at ALL. Feeding as Ashe or Bard top lane isn't too far removed from the shit Meteos pulled that one session, and Dyrus was sober. But who cares? It's all in good fun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-01-08T02:55:18.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What exactly happened?","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2017-01-08T02:59:41.832+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meteos played a few games drunk and performed horribly.\n\nTyler1 fanboys are arguing for a perma-ban ignoring all other context.","replies":[{"poster":"Tempname3055","date":"2017-01-08T23:54:00.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"1/27 isn't performing horribly it is called inting","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2017-01-08T03:36:23.214+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meteos got extremely drunk and fucked up a few games.
