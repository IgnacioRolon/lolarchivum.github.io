The official LOL merch site doesn't reach the UAE more specifically Abu Dhabi (Where I live). I was wondering if any store in Abu Dhabi that sells it or if there's a way to get the shirt, thank you very much.

I can't imagine the heat right around now -_-'....\n\nIt really sucks that our shippers aren't able to get that Ekko Tee shipped over to you, but many of our players have been able to find third party shipping partners who can take the package from us and get it delivered to you! Disclaimer: once the shipper has the package, we won't be able to help with tracking it down or issuing refunds.","replies":[{"poster":"BlueOrRunDownMid","date":"2017-07-22T00:39:36.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there anyway you can give me more info and stuff, its 4:40 am right now so Im sleeping but help would be much needed and yes ITS VERY HOT HERE, 50 celcius+ 12-1 PM everyday  xD","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-22T04:10:30.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We have a lot of players who live in areas that our normal shipping partners can't deliver to, but they instead opt to hire a third party delivery services like Shipwire or Fulfillrite. Basically, the way it works is we would ship the item to the delivery service, and at that point they would handle the delivery going overseas to Abu Dhabi. \n\nI've never used any of them personally, so I can't really offer my personal suggestion, but if you'd like to hit up our billing agents in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) they should be able to provide some more helpful information ^_^!","replies":[{"poster":"BlueOrRunDownMid","date":"2017-07-22T11:54:40.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the help Ill check out somethings and try them, btw, dont ban me but EUW>NA Kappa.
