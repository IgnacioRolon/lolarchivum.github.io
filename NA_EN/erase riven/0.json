I play 5 ranked games a day and stay the same rank, you are fine, you probably gain 21 and lose 15. You can gain 33 LP if you win 3 and lose 2, i gain 7 LP if i win 3 a and lose 2. You are fine. Play ranked and dont think negatively, ots just advanced norms. Oh also dont fucking duo with someone more than 1 division below you, i should be gaining 23 LP rn but im not bc i duoed with a silver 4 fml. He made me lose games and shit and its just not good for me. I am suppost to be gold 1 or gold 2 rn but um stuck at g4 with 55% wr avg bc of someone i duoed with.

The only time I find my teams unbalanced is when I play flex queue and I’m against d4 players as a silver2. I know solo queue has different mmr than flex but still I feel they could work on balancing that. Like if their main rank is diamond don’t put them any lower than gold 1.
