I did the Oceanic 4 gig update yesterday, switched to the japanese servers, did the 3 gig update for there, now ive just hopped back to oceanic and have to do the same 4 gig update i did yesterday. Is there a particular folder this update gets saved to on my computer so i can just copy/paste the region specific one to the destination when i want to hop between them to save a massive download? Thanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Sankey","date":"2017-09-30T22:36:35.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will do, thankyou very much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-29T17:55:31.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds pretty strange, so I reached out to our tech team about this and they agree.
