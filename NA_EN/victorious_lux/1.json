No matter how awesome the skin looks and how BEAUTIFUL that E is, I just don't think that dark star would work well with lux.

Too many people seem to think that skins **MUST** match a champion's _theme_ or _personality_ when they are fact not even canon and could be anything (especially cool 'what-if?' concepts). \n\nDoes Battlecast Skarner or Vel'Koz fit their respective themes and personalities? Not really! They're \"what if Viktor captured these champs and turned them into horrible machines to do his bidding\" skins because that's a cool concept. \nDark Star Lux could easily fit into the Dark Star line under a similar concept: Dark Star Thresh or whever their leader is may have recognized Lux's power and corrupted her mind to help them rain destruction and despair upon the world (something like the Legion in Warcraft or any number of similar concepts in many fantasy worlds). \nI think the Void Lux concept with the particles from the video would be an awesome look for such a Lux skin.","replies":[{"poster":"woobee","date":"2016-08-28T03:38:25.984+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very good point; skins should NOT be limited to accurate portrayals of lore or character. Otherwise, skins like the holiday sets wouldn't be made. Some of the best skins in the game (Arcade sets, Pool Party sets, DUNKMASTER Darius, Corporate Mundo, etc.) are only so great BECAUSE they have such a separate connection to the actual character. By expanding the connection's range, creativity and the chance for really kickass skins expand with it.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2016-08-28T17:08:46.320+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've wanted to make a 'dark' Lux since I started playing LoL! This is a really impressive roundup of artists work, thanks for including proper links.\n\nOn skins fitting champions; each champion has three 'core pillars' that are the key traits we think define them. When we work on a skin our goal is to retain one or two of those while radically changing the others.\n\nFor example Dunkmaster Darius is no longer a noxian general, but now a noxian team captain. No longer an axe weilding warrior, but a backboard slamming dunkmaster. He does however retain his merciless in-your face attitude.\n\nSanta Gragas - still gross\nArcade Ezreal - still cocky\nPool Party Graves - still can't have a cigar\n\nI think our best skins do this 'keep one change two' on many levels. Not just pillars but silhouette, visual hooks, colour pallet etc. where we find players losing the champion is when we push too far and change all the pillars (Lunar Wraith Caitlyn comes to mind). These lessons were tricky to learn, and I don't think we've got it figured out 100% yet, but I think they help make skins resonant.","replies":[{"poster":"Victorious Lux","date":"2016-08-28T17:30:12.837+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you :)\nI may have misunderstood, but does it mean that there is a way a 'Dark Lux' skin would actually be possible with the 'keep one, change two' or it would change her core pillars too much ?","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2016-08-29T00:47:50.222+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Making skins like a Dark Lux or Eclipse Leona is the kind of stuff I joined the team for!
