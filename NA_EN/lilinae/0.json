I discovered this after logging on to Howling Abyss to try out the new culinary mastery, which I assumed would also provide me with Poro snacks for every health potion upgrade. Much to my (and the Poros) dismay, I found myself Poro snack-less, which is why I, too, felt compelled to voice my concern about this grave starving Poro situation. I am happy to see I am not alone in my outrage and I hope that soon others will join the movement to SAVE THE POROS!!!!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darth Joberin","date":"2013-11-22T12:52:57.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes if we can't save the world at least save the poros","replies":[]}]}
