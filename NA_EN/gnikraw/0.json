Let Riot know you agree! You can also comment with the amount you would be willing to pay (in IP) for team skins. I appreciate any support,\r\nThanks,\r\n{{champion:77}}  GNIKRAW","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-06-20T19:56:25.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say if they did make it purchasable with IP, it would have to cost a lot because they still are skins being used.
