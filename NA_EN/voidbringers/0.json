I've had times where Eve's quiet Demon mode really challenges my multitasking... All the OTHER sounds on the map get stifled, which kind of makes you wonder how serious some of your team's skirmishes are, or how close the fight is to her invisibility.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bladerunner7777","date":"2017-10-29T07:46:00.624+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you ever test Death Sworn Katarina on Twisted Treeline?\n\nShe's really hard to see until she acquires miscellaneous buffs ie Elixir of Sorcery and maybe the Alter buffs\n\nI really don't like the trend of \"no character inking\" on specific champions/skins (if that's what it is - because that's definitely what it looks like)","replies":[{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2017-10-29T09:02:58.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol like elementalis lux the e and ults on certains maps using air,ice,mystic I can't see anything low graphics, invisible man.\nSkins get wins, slightly more advantages to terrain if their abilities and themselves blend in.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SweedishGunner","date":"2017-10-29T11:58:57.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A little bit off topic but Death Sworn Viktors Q and E (Q moreso) are too quiet as well, it makes the skin feel really puny and weak. \n\nAlso the Q seems really slow too and not smooth.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Daunt","date":"2017-10-29T10:59:57.428+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"The SFX are going to be fixed next patch.

I'd say she needs just a little bit of a louder ult, just a little and it will be perfect, however that doesn't make it a P2W skin. There is a literally giant red circle that appears around her meaning she is ulting, and the animation of how that circle appears is very visible.
