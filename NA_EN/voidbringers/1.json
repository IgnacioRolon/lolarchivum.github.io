The other issues would work themselves out. \n\n**The support class has shit for itemization**. Why is that?** Because other roles abuse support items. **Why do other roles abuse support items? **Because supports are balanced around being fucking broke** and need items that are cheap and cost-effective.\n\nHow should this be done? I don&#039;t know, but I do know trying to balance items around supports - who are less wealthy than their other brethren - isn&#039;t working. Sure, Rito could just design clunky items with super specific requirements for optimal use, but then why not just design a single clunky support mastery - that all supports would take -  that would solve support gold and experience problems? \n\nHere&#039;s an example of how such a mastery could work:\nTwin Souls Keystone Mastery -  link your soul permanently with another champion, causing all experience and gold gain from enemy minions to be duplicated across the bond. This mastery would also have several clauses that would prevent potential abuse: players must be x distance from each other,  lower level soul bonded partners receive elevated experience, players can only have one soul mate.","replies":[{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2016-05-13T03:18:34.606+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"How about a support summoner, similar to how junglers have {{summoner:11}} \n\nSomething with a fairly low cooldown similar to smite, that can be used to help make up for the extra needed gold and exp. and it could also make it available for support items to be purchased, in the same way that smite makes jungle items available.\n\nMy thought would be that after activating this summoner spell all gold and exp earned over the next few seconds by allies within xxx units, will be shared. \n\nMaybe similar to the jungle items, support items could modify how this effect works. Here are a few ideas\n\nOne of the items could double (or increase by some %) the amount of gold and exp gained during the effect. \nOne could cause you to earn gold and exp based on your enemy laner's last hit instead. \nOne could grant less gold and exp but also gives mana and/or health upon award. \n\nThere are certainly other ways this could be applied. And unfortunately it could also be abused, but it would require whoever is planning on abusing it to at least give up a summoner in order to do so.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-05-13T03:27:01.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Supports have support items for this. You know, the ones that are totally useless to people not in a duo lane?\n\nSure, they do not get the same sort of gold gain and exp, if they did, you would start seeing freaky shit like support-carry ahri or double ADCs..\n\nThink about what would happen to meta if duo lanes got the same exp and gold as a solo lane for half the effort. It would be.. fun, hilarious.. and incredibly destructive to the game as we know it.","replies":[{"poster":"khorney","date":"2016-05-13T03:48:19.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ohh man 2 extra gold every 10 sec its def coming in......","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"khorney","date":"2016-05-13T03:47:47.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"no one lieks to supp. supps are useless","replies":[]}]}
