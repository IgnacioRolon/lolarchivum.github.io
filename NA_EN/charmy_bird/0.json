If someone else can reproduce it, they can look at the logs. But they don't even ask for the logs.... They just give up and call it a day.\n\nEDIT: and I just went through that Twitter thread: the issue is that PLAYERS couldn't reproduce the bug either. I **_CAN_** reproduce the bug. 100% of the time. The bug in that Twitter thread also didn't technically need to be fixed the way they fixed it. If they couldn't actually find out what was killing companions, they **_COULD_** have just modified their code so that companions can't die, even on the ship. The \"climbing nothing\" bug would have persisted (and maybe never been found), but the \"companion dying and making my quest fail\" bug would have been solved.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-12-24T01:46:37.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might be able to 100% reproduce it, but if no one else can reproduce it then it means the impact is low and it won't be prioritized to be fixed as much compared to other bugs that have a bigger impact.","replies":[{"poster":"Jesus is Savior","date":"2019-12-24T04:57:36.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kei143,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=rYa8RpdJ,comment-id=00020000000000000000000200000000,timestamp=2019-12-24T01:46:37.496+0000)\n>\n> You might be able to 100% reproduce it, but if no one else can reproduce it then it means the impact is low and it won't be prioritized to be fixed as much compared to other bugs that have a bigger impact.\n\nOther people **_CAN_** reproduce it. Just not the one guy at Riot who tried. Also has existed literally just as long as hail of blades has existed, and has probably ruined many thousands of games for many thousands of people (even if they didn't notice that a bug made them die).\n\nThe sad thing is that the game is **_SUPPOSEDLY_** played server-side, and yet my PC hardware/software and/or network setup is causing a bug that makes me unable to reliably activate a rune.... lmao.","replies":[{"poster":"Lao Fu the Tiger","date":"2019-12-26T19:13:10.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe you. I also agree with your assessment that one option of the twitter post (wow that link image tho) is to just make it so companions can't die on the ship.\n\nThat being said, I think there are multiple facets here that are worth considering.\n\nFirst, the \"just make them unkillable on the ship\" thing. This is factual. From the outside, it's reasonable. It embodies the \"just this once\" mindset, and it's a regular practice in the software industry. At my job, we do it via \"feature flags\" (lolol \"feature\"). When there's something new or unstable we're trying, we'll block off that code and wrap it in a \"checkbox\" we control, so we can turn on or off the feature/bug as needed. Unfortunately, there's are two primary tradeoffs with doing so, and one implied problem with this approach:\n\n1. Code gets messy because we have to have two \"working\" paths of execution in addition to the logic that controls the flag as on/off.\n2. Many times the feature itself is strictly working vs. not working, not new vs. old. In other words, if the core functionality has a problem, the only two options are (in this case) have a bug in HoB that triggers rarely (but severely impacts gameplay) vs. completely disabling HoB.\n\nThe implied problem is that failing to identify the root cause of the problem leads to potentially more problems. Imagine in the ladder example there were more cut-scenes where the NPC could climb ladders and die. Blocking off death from this particular ship wouldn't solve other ship cut-scenes from NPC death. We could add a second \"don't die here\" execution path, sure, but imagine if this was a game engine problem and not a game-specific problem. Maybe the issue wasn't limited to cut-scenes at all, and random death could happen under weird conditions everywhere. \n\nIt boils down to, reproducing a bug is one thing, but despite how easy a bug is to reproduce, tracking down the **why** can be super tricky.","replies":[{"poster":"Jesus is Savior","date":"2019-12-26T22:44:24.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lao Fu the Tiger,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=rYa8RpdJ,comment-id=0002000000000000000000020000000000000000,timestamp=2019-12-26T19:13:10.048+0000)\n>\n> \n> The implied problem is that failing to identify the root cause of the problem leads to potentially more problems.

But the workaround would have temporarily improved the player experience while all this was happening.\n\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Lao Fu the Tiger,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=rYa8RpdJ,comment-id=0002000000000000000000020000000000000000,timestamp=2019-12-26T19:13:10.048+0000)\n>\n> Hail of Blades\n\n\nUntil a Rioter reaches out to me (and everyone else) who experiences this bug and at least **_tries_** to figure it out, I'm not accepting excuses. They haven't even tried. One dude probably spent 10-20 minutes trying to reproduce it, couldn't reproduce it, and gave up. No attempt to find players with this bug, look at their games, look at their logs, scan their hardware/software/network setup and compare it to players who don't experience this bug, etc.... Just nothing.\n\nThe guy in the Twitter link \"spent more time investigating than he had for any other individual bug in his career.\" Riot hasn't even really tried yet. The only reason I even know that they know the bug exists at all (and didn't completely ignore my bug report) is because an acquaintance told me \"I couldn't reproduce the bug and neither could my Rioter friend. That's why you haven't heard anything.\" ie: Riot didn't even tell me that they couldn't reproduce the bug. An acquaintance I was pestering did.
