If I'm 2/11 with a rengar or any other assassin I witn be able to delete Some1 in less than a second but Diana does. The moment Diana goes 6 and gets proly an item then say bye bye to the game cuz she'll insta delete any1 without reaction time","replies":[]},{"poster":"MiracleMorg94","date":"2019-09-04T20:23:29.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ahem, Diana is not an assassin, she's a diver.
