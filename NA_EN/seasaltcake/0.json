Can anyone clarify? \r\n\r\nNever bothered to find out until someone used the rp skin boost to be nice for our team, we were elated to say the least but it only lasted about 5 second until we were all booted out followed by the message above. And out of curiosity if a game does not start is the RP still spent cause if that's the case then I feel bad for the guy who paid for the boost only to have everyone kicked out a moment later.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-17T23:31:29.679+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The RP should be returned if the game doesn't start up.  The player just may have needed to leave, but there could be technical issues too, usually due to a network problem.  If a connection can't be maintained, then the player can lose sync and get left behind.  If that's the case, I hope they are able to get that fixed (and we're happy to help)!  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
