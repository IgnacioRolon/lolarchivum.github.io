Report rallying can be a form of harassment in and of itself, and it really doesn't do anything beneficial to call for reports anyhow - one report has the exact same weight as nine. You can report the player yourself, and it would have just as much effect as everyone else reporting.\n\nIf you reported him, he would get a punishment of his own for flaming - be it a chat restriction, a ban, or Honor progression being stalled.\n\nAll said, outside of what was mentioned before (previous punishments, etc.), you may want to provide your chat log(s) for peer review, so that we can point out where (if anywhere) you stepped over the line.","replies":[{"poster":"XxXGaMeR1999XxX","date":"2018-12-24T08:18:59.341+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I never take 25-game chat restriction,pls unban me ,i play this game from 2013 ,without any of bans","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-12-24T08:22:46.049+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, then if you've never had a 25-game Chat Restriction (or a 10-game CR, as I'll consider implied), I think it'd be best for you to present your chat logs.\n\nOne can only jump to a 14-day Suspension for the first punishment from either using zero-tolerance chat, or through committing a gameplay-related infraction (trolling, intentional feeding), so whatever information you can provide from your reform card would be very useful.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PH45","date":"2018-12-24T09:11:06.628+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Report calling can be considered a negative act, but I highly doubt that alone caused you to receive a 14-day ban.
