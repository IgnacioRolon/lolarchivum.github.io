Of all the people I reported and got penalized this season roughly 80% of them were junglers.\n\nI've written this before in another thread, but jungle has so much agency in this game that you can \"troll\" with making the slightest mistakes over and over on purpose and lose the game by being a mole. The jungle role statistically is the highest winrate that holds monopoly in challenger tier and its been proven season over season. It also means you can spite on your team on your own will easier than any role.\n\nThe jungle role NEEDED to lose power.

This is because, in the words of the GamingCurios Jeremy, \"Plat players are good, and they *know* they're good...and that's what makes them toxic.\" This elo is the proverbial gateway from mid-elo to high elo, after all.

Even if you contest the enemy's jungle now, it doesn't really matter. What matters most now is *strictly* keeping your team ahead in as many lanes as possible. This is bad for a multitude of reasons, and one of those reasons is the very reason everyone hates junglers - they now have to play *super selfishly* or they're not gonna be worth a rat's ass 5 minutes later. Riot's goal was to make every role matter more, but what they've done is effectively given every jungler a screenplay: get level 3 off half your jungle, go gank a side lane, go get a scuttle, go gank the mid lane, then either recall now to reset before your other half-clear and the last side lane, or just run through all of that then recall.\n\nIf junglers deviate from that script...or if their gank fails to secure a kill...or if the scuttle got contested and they can't gank afterwards cause both junglers got too low...all of those set junglers *stupidly* far behind now.\n\n\"But that's fine, cause they're PvE!\"\nWrong.

One they *must* follow, or else cost their team the game.\n\nRight now...honestly, if I want the enemy team to lose, then *as support* I try to fuck with the enemy jungler. A SUPPORT JUST SHOWING UP AND POKING THEM EARLY GAME can end up putting them half a level or more *further behind* if you forced them away from their camp or scuttle.

Since they're basically *forced by Riot's changes* right now to play super selfishly or be *completely* irrelevant, I chalk up the lack of their power in this current season more or less to Riot shafting them.\n\nThe other biggest issue is...well, to put it simply, I don't really think that people understand the role of a jungler anyway. The goal of a jungler is to *relieve map pressure*, not necessarily to *always* get the kill when they gank. Getting the kill is the *best possible* result, but backing the enemy off the lane so the lane can breathe is the *actual purpose* behind what a gank even is. I think a lot of people forget that.\n\nBasically...when a jungler ganks a lane, one of three things usually happen:\n\n- The lane they're ganking remains completely oblivious to the gank and continues to idly cs. Whatever...that's still relieving pressure...*technically* a successful gank, especially if the jungler still forced a summoner or something, and didn't die.\n\n- The lane they're ganking puts in the effort necessary to complete the gank, and the gank is successful. Either you got the kill, or you got them to blow all their escapes/summoners and you now have considerably more pressure in lane now. The jungler if you didnt get the kill probably taxes the wave a bit or helps you push it in to deal damage to tower, then they move on. ***This is the result you want.***\n\n- The gank didn't secure the kill (maybe they blew all their escapes/flash/whatever got them out...this is still a successful gank, technically) and the laner, convinced that the jungler is going to help them after the gank is over, decides to go balls deep, tower dive, and...usually gets rekt. (I'll call this \"The Reyn Special\" since if I ever play assassins and they live with 6 hp, I admit I'm this bad. Fortunately, I stay as a support to specifically avoid the tryhardy bloodlust of playing assassins. xD)\n\nAll of these things are more or less completely dependent on the *laner's* understanding, more than the *jungle's* understanding of lane mechanics. Two of those three things are often attributed to \"man, this jungler never helps me!\" And that's just straight up untrue. I want to also point out that first example - people always attribute \"afk farming\" as a reason for a loss, and I want to point out exactly how many laners honestly do just afk farm through ganks. Notice - they had ZERO part in the gank, and the gank was probably still successful. The *only* time that anyone needs to throw the term \"afk farming\" around, is if there's a teamfight for dragon or baron, and someone is mindlessly clearing small camps or mindlessly sitting in their lane last hitting. Let's all just come to terms that people farming does not on its own lose games...\n\nNow...I do give credit where it's due - other things I know happen pretty frequently are:\n\n- The JUNGLER wants to initiate their gank by performing a dive, you go with them, and you both get dunked.\n\n- The JUNGLER ends up chasing the guy after the successful gank, tower diving and feeding (I'll call this \"The Zero Special\" after a friend of mine who does this *every game* on Vi...)\n\n- The ENEMY JUNGLER counterganks and you lose the 2v2\n\nTwo of *THOSE* things are 100% on your jungler's shotcalling, and the last one is...well, either \"unlucky\" or \"their jungler's a god at responding\", take your pick. Of all of the things to QQ your jungler about...I'd say only one of the 6 things I talked about is really warranted, and that's \"The Zero Special\". If you fail the dive, you guys probably played it bad, or woefully underestimated the guy. If the enemy jungler shows up and dunks you, then you got outplayed. Oof. But...if the jungler goes apeshit in your lane and suicide dives your laner after the actual gank is done, then yeah...that's a bad jungler. There's really not an excuse for that one. Any more than there's an excuse for my abysmal assassin plays. :P","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Grunt666","date":"2019-11-25T19:32:00.759+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PhearBunny,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=lXyEvdAR,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-11-25T11:25:17.839+0000)\n>\n> idk why people wanted Jungle influence nerfed.

Your solution to losing your lane is to dump your laner on the rest of your team. You are the problem not the solution like you think. Cool you died 3 times to your lane but you won’t feed instead you will hide behind your turret and let your 3-0 lamer roam the map all game destroying every other lane gee thanks you sure did your job by not “feeding”.\n\nLet’s add in a healthy dose of “I pinged Mia” not my fault.","replies":[{"poster":"RavenMagus","date":"2019-11-26T00:07:22.536+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"So wait you would rather your teammate start to lose lane, then feed another 6 kills and instead of dealing with a 3-0 laner roaming you're dealing with a 9-0 laner roaming?\n\n...what?","replies":[{"poster":"Grunt666","date":"2019-11-26T19:53:56.525+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RavenMagus,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=lXyEvdAR,comment-id=000200010001,timestamp=2019-11-26T00:07:22.536+0000)\n>\n> So wait you would rather your teammate start to lose lane, then feed another 6 kills and instead of dealing with a 3-0 laner roaming you're dealing with a 9-0 laner roaming?\n> \n> ...what?\n\nYikes amazing how many people truly have no clue or understanding of this game you even managed to get upvotes and I got down voted lol. So let me educate you on league of legends. Yes if you are losing your lane I want you to keep lane pressure focus on CS even if it means you keep dying. Here is why and how big brains understand league better.\n\n1) the more consecutive times people die the less gold they are worth. So you going from 0-3 to 0-7 isnt a huge deal. Basically you are bad so you were never going to do much anyways so do your best to give your team a chance to carry you. Now this doesnt mean FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT, it means keep pressure focusing on CS and try to mitigate your death count and keep your ahead lane opponent busy so the rest of your team can carry you.\n\n2) The only way your team has a chance to win is if other lanes are winning enough to compensate for you losing. If you sit and hide under turret all that happens is your lane roams and takes a big steaming dump on the other winning lanes now your team has no chance. way to go you managed to not only lose your lane you managed to lose everyones lane. On top of that refering back to point 1 unlike the diminishing gold you are worth your lane is huge now getting full gold for killing all the other winning lanes your team had while you sit under turret poorly afk farming pretending you will \"catch up\". sitting under your turret will never result in a comeback....should be common sense.....\n\n3) at least if you are pressuring and your lane still roams you are moving the ball forward for yourself and more importantly your team. Now while your lane is roaming you are taking turret plates, you are taking down turrets which helps your entire team and improves your chances to win, especially if your team turns around a fight now you are in position to make serious headway to ending the game pushing down your lane. If you are hiding behind your turret afk farming  you are never EVER in position to do ANYTHING that can help your team win.\n\nSo when you are losing your lane there are only two options to help your teams chances to win and neither involve with you the person who got dumpstered magically deciding after you got creamed that then you will play safe and let your lane roam (pro tip play safe to start with not after you lose hard). Option 1 is focus farm pushing lane and keeping pressure to prevent your lane from roaming to influence other lanes of your that might be winning and are your only hope to win the game. Option 2 is YOU ROAM, you lost your lane sitting in it behind your turret has ZERO hope of resulting in you catching up. So admit you lost and then say let me go see if I can roam make some plays and turn my other lanes into the snowballs that will win the game while the 3-0 that beat me down sits alone up top farming, and then later we win team fights.\n\n\nThat is the proper strategy, not hiding behind your turret and letting zed go rape every lane to ensure all of your teams lanes lost. Its why players like hashinshin can stay upper diamond/low masters while feeding his arse off every other game he understands even if he is losing he can draw pressure to himself when he is worth no gold while the rest of his team continues to snowball and in the end carry him.\n\nOh I am sure the small brain crew will down vote me but hey you can't help stupid can you.","replies":[{"poster":"RavenMagus","date":"2019-11-27T01:49:37.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are losing the lane your teammates are going to have to deal with the enemy laner.
