Riot, you guys said you were gonna rework Sol, wtf happen? Or where is it? In my opinion, since Aurelion Sol was first relesaed, he was never OP or hard to play around teamfights. He was buggy and still is buggy. But you guys nerfing him totally killed the champion. Let the bronze/wood players struggle against his Passive and W. Helps them teach everyone how to kite vs Aurelion.\n{{champion:104}} needs a small rework or another big rework where he can be put back in the adc role. Because it is impossible right now to balance him if people are constantly taking him jungle/top. (That's right, there are few who still play him top)\n{{champion:40}} long overdued like Nunu because her kit may be outdated, but she somehow maintains like a 55% winrate at support just by cockblocking the enemy jungler or whoever assassin tries to kill her adc with a push of a Q. Also, I don't think Riot has ever fully rework a support besides the mini-rework to {{champion:12}} .\n{{champion:54}} needs his kit change besides the good R ult. I say he needs something to keep up in wave clear but also good CC so that he can peel well like new Galio.\n{{champion:11}} About almost everything has to go. Q is okay for outplaying a dueling champion, but true damage, W healing damage reduction, E true damage and a second {{summoner:6}} +bonus atk speed on Ult has to go. With just {{item:1416}}/{{item:1419}} and {{item:3124}} with the choice of full AD or bruiser, Yi has late game already and impossible to peel around (unless Yi's team is full AD and your team has 3 tanks {{champion:54}} can fill two).\n{{champion:82}} bring him back Top/Mid lane. His juggernaut rework in season 5 was not only Overpowered, but also a complete failure after the multiple nerfs.\n{{champion:133}} needs a lane-playstyle FULL-REWORK IDENTITY. Yes I know, Quinn is a ranged top laner like Gnar, Teemo and/maybe Jayce, but since the marksmen update in Season 6. She has no identity in terms of both role and playstyle. She maybe a second-roamer like a mid-lane assassin and top-lane split pushing style. But she will never be a real champion or a real teamplayer. \n{{champion:35}} That's right Shaco mains, hate me all you want. Even with a Q nerf, Shaco will forever always will be IMPOSSIBLE TO BUFF/NERF. Build him AD/AP or bruiser, cri-build, lethality-build, it just becomes impossible for Riot to nerf the damage that shaco is mostly doing. Which is why he needs  a SUPER-GAY CLOWN REWORK UPDATE.\n{{champion:77}} needs a complete rework. He needs like a dash instead of running in there like a mofo. His mini-rework was a failure.\n{{champion:157}} Ah yes, everyones' most hated champion tied with Teemo. I could make a long description for Yasuo, but I can create a discussion about him another time. But I do have a goal for Riot on reworking Yasuo: **Make him a fully-dedicated mid-laner again**. We can erase windwall and his unlimited dash, but still give him a healthy defensive ablity where Mage or adcs who are skillshot-reliant can get around.\n\n**Honorable mention but as joke**\n{{champion:67}} Rework Vayne where she doesn't suck at waveclearing so that **DIE-HARD-CSING-SPLIT-PUSHING**-Vayne mains can stop flaming, int feeding, afking and wasting everyone's got damn 1-hour of their time losing a game because of freaking Vayne player?","replies":[]}]}
