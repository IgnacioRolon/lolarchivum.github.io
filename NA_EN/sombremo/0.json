There are no low-skill or easy champions, regardless of a lot of common misconceptions.

Excels more in teamfights than 1v1, unique ressource to manage too\n\n{{champion:82}}   Not flashy,simple mechanics but easiest champion to gank and you have low health scaling. You need to have  a good game knowledge if you don't want to feed more than the redcross. requires some attention during teamfights since the ghost is buggy sometimes(most bugged champion,so if you want some challenge,go for it because sometimes your spells won't do damages :p ). You can outplay the enemy if you have good knowledge of the damages you may take before dying since generating your shield is your core mechanic,that's the difference between 1 kill and 10hp left and dead. Same thing for {{champion:122}} {{champion:420}} (except for the ganking part ).\nJuggernaut are not difficult mechanically but with their telegraphed playstyle,it's hard to get to your target;especially if they have mobility\n\n\n{{champion:24}}{{champion:23}} :no worries for the early,you'll still murder the entire team(or splitpush really hard)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Netherfang04","date":"2017-05-01T04:31:10.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well he isn't very high in skill cap but is fun and has out play potential with his W {{champion:62}} boy is he a lot of fun. I like full damage wukong and he can be top jungle and ive played him mid. He destroys most mages early because his base damage is high. But i also start with {{item:1036}} {{item:2031}}\n\nBut honestly you should save all your IP for lvl 30 so you can get your tier 3 runes for your AD page AP page and ADC page. Runes are super expensive. Youll spend like 12-15k ip for all the runes for those 3 pages","replies":[]},{"poster":"JuannyBear","date":"2017-05-01T04:17:44.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, Yasuo, Lee Sin, Riven, and Poppy are some of them.","replies":[]}]}
