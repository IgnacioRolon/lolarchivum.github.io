The champions who are in NerfsDay, Urgot, Veigar, and several others, jealous of the great power of these champions, have decided to fight in an epic battle, and team up together.\n\n{{champion:67}} They can&#039;t stop us, we&#039;re damn overpowered! Our winrate is too strong for them, and our playrate makes Koreans get a nerd boner to us! Nothing can stop us! Mwaahahah!\n{{champion:92}} Yes, my sword is as broken as Faker playing me, and beating Reginald as Zed. Nothing can stop us. The phonies in NerfsDay are puny, and the balance changes Riot try to do on us do nothing to ruin our power. We are too mighty.\n{{champion:72}} Yes, my rocks are truly unbreakable. Fuck gems, rocks are much stronger. Too strong.\n{{champion:105}} With my untargettable E, and my Q that goes through minions, and champions, and a shark, I can kill anyone in a single burst combo, and escape. Suck it. Riot does not care, because they want LCSBigPlays. We got it.\n{{champion:39}} But... Riot has kept nerfing me... I&#039;m with you guys. I swear!\n{{champion:67}} You puny imbecile, you are just a failure in our eyes, LEAVE! Go back to NerfsDay, where you truly belong! Go down to the depths Irelia, you are no longer with us.\n{{champion:39}} But... But... I did nothing wrong.. I WILL GET STRONGER! RIOT WILL BUFF ME. YOU&#039;LL SEE.\n___\nAt NerfsDay.\n{{champion:45}} The damn NerfThisWonderland group is much too strong for us. Skarner has betrayed us... How could you Skarner, you were like a brother to me!\n{{champion:36}} -licks Veigar&#039;s face- YEEEE! HE BRUTHER WITH US! BRUTHER!\n{{champion:45}} Screw off Mundo, I&#039;m in a crisis right now.\n{{champion:6}} Mordekaiser too.. We lost him... he died during the war... Why...\n{{champion:83}} My ghouls are unstoppable, we can still win! With my high mana costs, and my little prescence in the meta, we are UNSTOPPABLE!\nThe legendary item, {{item:3711}}, stays in the hands of the mighty {{champion:16}} statue. Legend has it, that she shot bananas out of her magical banana cannon, nerfing any champion that dared to fight her. Vayne killed her with {{item:3153}} and {{item:3933}}. Maybe one day, Soraka can come back. The only way to revive Soraka is to get {{champion:26}} back into the group, but legend has it, that he is trapped in banana space, chewing on a banana. \n___\nBack at NerfThisWonderland\n{{champion:238}} I&#039;m back, from the depths of hell. The Dark Lord was pleased with my visit. \n{{champion:67}} You... You&#039;re back! Welcome back Zed! We are in a war with the NerfsDay crew, and we must stop them from getting buffed by Riot, before they come back in the meta. We are much too strong for them right now, we must attack them now.\n{{champion:105}} Yes, we must. I can destroy them, shall I go? As a Captain, I declare that I shall go and wipe them out.\n{{champion:412}} No. I&#039;ll go. You scrubs need to learn how to be a real korean. With Senpai Faker with us, and Faker&#039;s hand, nothing can stop us... Haha. Goodbye NerfsDay...\n___\n\nThe next day, at NerfsDay.\n{{champion:83}} What... who are you? (Yorick trying to open his eyes, he is grabbed by an unstoppable force, and is bumped into a green shadowy figure.) You.. are.. Thresh...! NO. No. no. NOT MY SOUL. PLEASE N-.\nHours later, after the grief of Yorick&#039;s death, and several tears out of the NerfsDay group, they sit in the main room of the headquarters, praying for Soraka to bless them with bananas. \n{{champion:45}} Please, Soraka.. -cries-, I beg of you! Your majestic bananas can save us, please! Revive Yorick! Do something please Soraka. I know you are in there, in space banana land... But please. Come forth!\n{{champion:36}} Mundo want to see Yorick back! Mundo! Mundo! Mundo, Soraka, see Yorick! \n(A special voice calls, WHAT IS YOUR SUMMONER AND WHAT DOES HE DO.)\nThe whole cast of the NerfsDay community looks around, trying to find where the voice comes from. When, new champions come in.\n\n{{champion:44}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:20}}  all walk into the room, with sad expressions on their face, looking at the body of Yorick. Until, one of them holds a magical item, {{item:3026}}, Taric, with gems, slowly places it on Yorick&#039;s body as everyone in the room watches with awe, seeing Yorick come back to life.\n{{champion:78}} Yo, Yorick. You there or what? We stole it from NerfThisWonderland, and we heard you were in need of dire help. We&#039;ve come to help you guys. You in or what?\n{{champion:3}} With my taunt, nothin can stop us.\n{{champion:20}} I liek snowballs.\n{{champion:6}} Heck yeah, we need help. To take down... NerfThisWonderland.\n(Everyone in the room gasps as they hear the words come out of Urgot&#039;s mouth.)\nThere is no way, we can take down NerfThisWonderland! We can&#039;t!\n{{champion:28}} Psst, hey. I can help. \n(All the champions stare at Evelynn, confused. They have never seen her before, and this is their first time actually seeing her.)\n{{champion:45}} Who are you? Tell me!\n{{champion:28}} I&#039;m Evelynn, a champion who&#039;s also never played. I recently became sort of strong, but not as strong as NerfThisWonderland. I&#039;m sort of an outcast now between both groups. There&#039;s a whole group in the BalancedSoloMid group, but, we don&#039;t side with either of the groups. If they hear about me talking to you guys, I&#039;m dead! \n{{champion:36}} Mundo like Evelynn, let her in! Mundo allow it!\n{{champion:44}} My gems like the feel of you also, let her in.\n{{champion:78}} I guess it&#039;s a deal. We will team up.\n{{champion:83}} (Opens one eye, and the other), who are you guys? Poppy? Taric? OH MY GOSH! \n{{champion:38}} I guess it&#039;s time. We&#039;ll team up, and destroy these guys! Who&#039;s with me!\n(Everyone screams, NERFSDAY!)\n\n___\nSpecial Note from me: Hi, if you really did like this, please respond to  tell me to continue, and I&#039;ll alert you every time I add something new. If you don&#039;t like it, please don&#039;t downvote, and just respond. I worked REALLY hard on this, please.\n___\n\nAt NerfThisWonderland\n{{champion:412}} Mission, Accomplished. Heh, that was too easy. It was like taking candy from a baby.\n{{champion:72}} Yes, we have already taken down one of them! Hah! There is no chance of them beating us.\n{{champion:92}} (walks to where Skarner and Thresh are talking), yeah, they nerfed armor, for me and Vayne to utterly destroy NerfsDay! Mwahahaha! They will never see the light of day, and be stuck in the fountain! No one can stop us! MWAHAHHAA.\n(Someone new walks in, it seems he is blind.)\n{{champion:64}} I have never seen the light of day in 10 years. Hello.\n(Vayne walks in to the group also)\n{{champion:67}} It&#039;s... the legendary Lee Sin. Riot has buffed him into a godlike form! All praise him!\n{{champion:64}} Yes, thank you. I am Lee Sin, and I want to help you guys in your quest, to UTTERLY OBLITERATE NERFSDAY. But, blindness does not limit me, I am much stronger while blind actually.\n(Fizz decides to join)\n{{champion:105}} SHARRK! (Fizz throws a shark, but Lee Sin kicks it away, smashing into a wall).\n{{champion:64}} Something tried to tickle me.\n{{champion:105}} NO. SHARKK!!!! WHY DID YOU DO THAT?\n{{champion:64}} (Lee Sin threw a sonic wave, and connected it with a resonating strike at Fizz, but Fizz dodged it barely with Trickster&#039;s Hop, and Qed through Lee).\n{{champion:105}} I&#039;m not that weak you know.\n{{champion:72}} Skarner attempts to clap, but his hands don&#039;t allow him to do so.\n{{champion:67}} We are much too strong, with Fizz&#039;s agility, Skarner&#039;s invincibility, and my speed, and Lee Sin&#039;s strength and speed, and Riven&#039;s unstoppable force, nothing can stop us.\n___\nBack at Nerfsday...\n\nThe group devised a plan to take down NerfThisWonderland, and in order to do so, they must strategically kill their most powerful one - Vayne. Little did they know, Lee Sin had recently joined. In order to kill Vayne, and her powerful damage, she must be strategically baited. \n\n{{champion:38}} I have a plan. If I can get Trickster's Glass, I can disguise as Fizz, and trick Vayne into thinking I am Fizz... Then I can get her!\n{{champion:6}} But... What if you aren't powerful enough?\n{{champion:38}} I will. I will live on, and you'll see me tomorrow.\n\nLater that night, the whole group had trouble sleeping... However, Syndra. She dreamed of something strange. Like she was watching Kassadin. He just grabbed the Trickster's glass, and turned into Fizz. He found NerfThisWonderland, and came to the headquarters, until he saw Fizz laying around. The enemy Fizz, staring at Kassadin (disguised as Fizz), chuckled, \"Trickster's glass huh, Kassadin?\", as void particles shined off Kassadin. Instaneously, Fizz threw a shark, and Kassadin teleported backwards.\n\n{{champion:38}} Damn you. I'll send you into hell!\n{{champion:105}} I am much too powerful for you, mwahaha.\nKassadin threw a burst of void energy, but Fizz jumped on his pole, and splashed down on Kassadin, right after Kassadin teleported in the back of Fizz. Kassadin shoved his void energy sword into Fizz's body.\n{{champion:38}} Mission Complete.\nKassadin grabbed his sword out of Fizz's body, until Fizz's body turned yellow, for a few seconds, seeming like an eternity. Kassadin kept slicing Fizz, to no avail, nothing happened.\n{{champion:105}} {{item:3157}}, heh. Saved me there.\nKassadin teleported in the back of Fizz, but Fizz dashed through Kassadin, and shoved his spear into Kassadin's body.\n{{champion:38}} No... my friends... no... it's too early for me... No... please... A small tear ran down Kassadin's face, as he went on his knees, and dropped on the ground, blood flowing out of his body. \n{{champion:105}} Goodbye, Kassadin. It was sure a shame you couldn't live longer. \nSyndra, worried, woke the whole group up, and told everyone the news. She had seen what happened, and told the whole crew. \n{{champion:134}} Kassadin... he died... Fizz... killed him...\n{{champion:6}} No... please... NO! Please.... He was our ally! We lost one...\n{{champion:83}} I wish I died, instead of him... I'm merely a mess, and there was no point in giving me Guardian Angel...\n{{champion:45}} No, there was a point. You are a helpful ally too Yorick. Don't forget that... We can still win this fight... We just have to play our cards right.. You know?\n{{champion:44}} Gems.. If he only had gems...\n{{champion:78}} We must stay strong, he was an ally, but he would be happy if we avenged him. We can still bring him back to life. Yorick, you can bring him back to life. Temporarily, but we can hear his last words.\n{{champion:36}} Mundo ask, what did Kassadin say when he die?\n{{champion:134}} He... he said... No... my friends... no... it's too early for me. No... please... \n{{champion:154}} We may be champions in a simple game with summoners, but we have feelings. We're like any animal, human, or any living being. We may not mean much... but we matter. We're going to avenge Kassadin, and nothing can stop us.\n{{champion:3}} They have an arsenal of items we don't have, and their strength is much stronger then what we have. We must tread carefully... But we can still win this - who's with me.\n(Everyone screams in triumph together)\n___\n{{champion:105}} Haha, Kassadin tried to kill me! It was adorable! Can you believe it Vayne?\n{{champion:67}} Nope, can't. I can't believe he was THAT stupid to fight you! Haha! What an idiot!\n{{champion:92}} Fizz, you're an idiot. (Riven slams Fizz in the head before he can do anything), you should've kept him as a damn hostage you idiot. \n{{champion:72}} Riven's right, you shouldn't have. There was no point besides glory.\n{{champion:64}} No - you should have let him go. I want you guys to win, but I don't want violence, sorry, but I'm leaving NerfThisWonderland. I never wanted someone to die...\n{{champion:67}} No... Lee. Don't leave, Fizz made a simple mistake. \n{{champion:64}} Fine, only for this time. \n{{champion:412}} But... thing is, what will we do? They obtained a Trickster's Glass, from a disabled game mode... Wait... I have an idea. What if, we STOLE, THE POWER, OF URF?\n{{champion:238}} yes... Yes.... YES! That's exactly what we SHALL DO! There is no reason not to! If we can obtain that luxurious power, we're UNSTOPPABLE! YES, MWAHAHAH.\n___\nBack at NerfsDay\n{{champion:28}} There is one way we can win against them. We must summon, Soraka.\n{{champion:78}} Soraka? Did she die?\n{{champion:45}} She was sealed by Vayne, put into a statue state by the insane damage of Vayne... She was the strongest out of all of us. She went on a final mission to finish off Vayne, until Riot created Sated Devourer... She obtained the power, and is truly unstoppable now. Soraka was destroyed during the battle, and before she died, Soraka put herself into a statue form until someone decides to restore her. She could revive any player legend has it.\n{{champion:28}} We have one problem - Riven. Her shield is so immense, and she doesn't take much damage during it. What should we do? \n{{champion:6}} We shall, CC her to death. I will use my most powerful skill on her, and we shall switch places.\n{{champion:78}} I'll ultimate a rock, so only the rock can deal damage to me.\n{{champion:28}} What if she throws the rock at you...\n(Poppy imagines Riven throwing a rock at her, and getting knocked out).\n{{champion:78}} Uhm... Well.. I didn't.. You kn-\n{{champion:28}} Yeah, I know. WAIT. We can contact Ryze.. to summon Soraka back! He knows all the spells in the universe!\n{{champion:13}} But, I'm already here.\n(Everyone in the room stares at Ryze, wondering where he came from).\n{{champion:13}} I heard about one of the best casters in League getting taken down by that slippery fish, so I knew I had to team up. I heard you guys talking about me summoning Soraka, so let's do this.\n\n(Hours later, Ryze still casting the spell, a dark energy circles around the Soraka statue, a laugh can be heard.)\n\n(More laughs are heard, but regardless, Ryze continues to cast the spell. A more sinister laugh occurs, and the dark energy dissipates, and a jester pops out.)\n\n{{champion:35}} Let's play a game.\n\n___\n\nAt NerfThisWonderland, a strange dark energy surrounds Fizz when he is alone.\n{{champion:105}} What is this...\n(A sinister laugh is heard, and suddenly Fizz's pole is thrown across the room, a invisible jester appears and cutthroats Fizz.)\n{{champion:105}} Wh- I... can't.... breathe...\n{{champion:35}} Why so serious :)?\n{{champion:105}} Wh... are.. you?\n{{champion:105}} drops on the ground, dead. As Shaco's laughs are heard in the background, a single, sinister laugh is heard in the distance. \nSoon after, Irelia appears.\n{{champion:39}} I have reappeared in the meta, TAKE THAT VAYNE. Where are you VAYNE! I'LL KILL YOU!\n{{champion:35}} This will be fun!\n{{champion:39}} tries to look for the voice, nothing is near her. Until, she is pounded by a series of jack in the boxes, and the jester starts slicing her repeatedly.\n{{champion:39}} No! Irelia uses her powerful Hiten Style on {{champion:35}}, but {{champion:35}} explodes, killing Irelia immediately.\n{{champion:35}} The jokes on you!\nThe next day...\n{{champion:67}} What the hell... Someone killed Irelia, and Fizz? Who the hell could've done that... \n{{champion:92}} Fizz's cockiness really got to him, and he probably died because of it... Shit. This is not good. Shall we send in new recruits?\n{{champion:412}} Let's do it.\n{{champion:1}} Come play with me!\n___\nBack at NerfsDay\n{{champion:13}} Well, my work here is done. {{champion:35}} has killed Fizz, and Irelia. I can not help you anymore. Shaco has now disappeared. \n{{champion:28}} Thank you, Kassadin is now proud.\n{{champion:83}} Yeah... thank you so much.\n{{champion:134}} It seems Kassadin must be very happy with his revenge on Fizz. That damn slippery fish deserves it.\n___\nBack at NerfThisWonderland\n{{champion:238}} Vayne, I have come to tell you the great news. I have obtained the power of URF for one of us.. Who shall it be?\n{{champion:67}} Give it to Riven, she shall be invincible, and can wipe out NerfsDay entirely.\n{{champion:64}} No. Let me have it Zed. I shall be much stronger.\n{{champion:238}} Vayne, you want him to have it? (takes a glance at Vayne)\n{{champion:67}} No, you refuse to kill. Sorry. By the way, since you don't want to kill, bye.\n{{champion:82}} Sucks to be you Lee, but goodbye my friend. \nVayne condemns Lee into a wall, stunned, and Zed throws a shuriken and shadow at Lee. Lee attempts to Sonic Wave Vayne, but Vayne dashes to the left, and Lee misses. Mordekaiser kills Lee Sin, and Lee Sin is revived into a ghostly form.\n{{champion:82}} Lee, kill everyone in Nerfsday. Do it. Now.\n{{champion:238}} Goodbye Lee, (Zed throws the power of URF into Lee, and as {{champion:64}} seems to twitch, and Lee disappears into the ground. However, a human version of Lee is created, and is now mind controlled by Vayne, Mordekaiser, and Zed.)\n{{champion:64}} Command started. Percentage of success: 100%. Starting up cooldowns, removing energy costs... Speed added. Goodbye, NerfsDay.\n{{champion:67}} Betrayal is bliss, isn't it Zed? However, it feels great. God damn great. Fuck NerfsDay, we'll kill them all and make them cry.\n{{champion:238}} Yes, heh. Goodbye NerfsDay.\n___\n(Note, the story begins to ramp up from here, and my writing is significantly better.)\n___\nCries of fear and blood fills the headquarters, as one by one NerfsDay is being destroyed. Syndra is seemingly instantly killed by Tibbers and Lee. Yorick escapes with one eye. Nunu escapes only his brain, legs, and Tibbers bit off a chunk of Nunu's body. Blood is filled in Room  The screams of fear immediately alert the rest of NerfsDay to run, and Nunu and Yorick barely escape. Syndra is laying on the floor, blood flowing out of her body. Lee is looking for others, but can not find anyone. Tibbers is smashing through the headquarters, breaking wooden tables, and ripping apart the Soraka statue.\n\nThe headquarter is falling apart, and rocks begin to fall in on the group. Eventually, everyone escapes, and the headquarter collapses on itself. As the ruins of the headquarters are filled with dust, and Syndra's body is laying in the ruins, it seems all hope is lost. The rest of the group, looking back seems to be scared, nervous, on what to do.\n\n{{champion:28}} Lee has gotten the power of Urf.... \n{{champion:20}} Please... help me... Help my yeti...\n{{champion:28}} I know someone that can hotfix you gu-\n{{champion:45}} NO. Shut up Evelynn. Your plans have killed Syndra! We're dying ONE BY ONE, with all of your plans. Please. Stop.\n{{champion:78}} We can still wi-\n{{champion:6}} We can't. They are just too strong...\n\nThe whole group seems to lost hope, and everything seems lost. Lee Sin has become too strong suddenly, and the whole group didn't even know that Lee Sin worked for NerfThisWonderland. There is no way the nonmeta champions can win against these NerfThisWonderland. On a large mountain peak, cold, and icy, it seemed that all hope was lost. \n\n{{champion:2}} What you guys doin here? Eh? In this barren weather, you guys ain't fit at all for this. Come, follow me ya noobs.\n(Reluctantly, the group decided to follow, into the Frelijord. The Frelijord Group, an ice barren group with few members, but all ice cold deep inside, and power comes a long way in the Frelijord.)\n{{champion:22}} Who these losers Olaf?\n{{champion:201}} They look sort of fine, oh boy this yeti needs some help!\n{{champion:74}} I can fix that.\n{{champion:127}} These losers, pfft, they won't stand a chance in the Frelijord... We can teach em maybe, to fix em up to be a 1/10th of how strong we are. \n{{champion:106}} Hmm. They seem strong.\n{{champion:45}} Can you please give us training! We need it! \n{{champion:28}} Yes... Can you also fix up Nunu?\n{{champion:20}}  Please...\n{{champion:74}} I hate to say it - but I can do it with _ease_, hate saying that, but yes, I can. \n(Couple hours later, Nunu is remade into **Nunu Bot**, and is empowered with new strength. \n{{champion:106}} You guys, follow me and Olaf. Alright you noobs?\n{{champion:127}} Why are you idiots wasting time with those newbies?\n{{champion:22}} Yeah! (Ashe highfives Lissandra, and takes another gulp of her beer.)\n{{champion:127}} Give me another one Graggy, my old friend. \n{{champion:79}} But you guys drank the whole shop, and I have no more beer for me to drink!\n{{champion:22}} Make beer then.\n{{champion:79}} *Sighs*\n___\nBack at NerfThisWonderland\n{{champion:67}} It's gone... Haha... YES. THEY ARE ALL DEAD. HAH, WHAT PUNY WEAKLINGS.\n(The whole NerfThisWonderland group is walking over the rubble of the old headquarters of NerfsDay, as Lee Sin is taking a rest.)\n{{champion:64}} They have all died, Vayne. They are gone. Syndra is dead, everyone is dead.\n{{champion:92}} Wait, they brought friends? This... is impossible. \n{{champion:67}} Riven, they are all dead. It does not matter now, we have finished our mission. It's time, to destroy the one piece left.\n(The Soraka Statue is still left standing, broken, chipped, but still somewhat standing.)\n{{champion:72}} Die! Statue!\n(Skarner breaks through the Soraka Statue instantly, but all the pieces glow a yellow color, and for a second, you can hear a voice.\n(Violence cannot go unanswered.)\n{{champion:67}} What the hell! Someone's alive?\n{{champion:16}} They are all alive, Vayne. Including Syndra. I can revive anyone, and I am right here.\n{{champion:67}} You're in that statue?\n{{champion:16}} Fuck no, I have a banana cannon, BIATCH. Boys, ready up the banana cannons.\n{{champion:122}} Yes Queen Soraka! We shall!\n{{champion:86}} For ~~Demacia~~! Wait... For Banacia!\n{{champion:75}} Die, Vayne!\n(Instantly, bananas began flowing out of the cannons, healing the headquarters back, and the statue, but when they hit the enemies, they blow up)\n{{champion:67}} Oh Soraka, you can't beat me. I am much too strong. \n{{champion:92}} Vayne! These fucking hurt! Shit! Shit, FUCK! (Riven is pounded by bananas, and blood is flowing out of her body immediately.\n{{champion:72}} THERE'S SO MANY! RETREAT! RETREAT!\n{{champion:16}} Not yet, bois. Come back here.\n(Soraka places a silence zone where Skarner and Riven are, and they are trapped to be pounded by bananas.)\n{{champion:16}} Bye. Boys, aim INTO THAT CIRCLE WHERE RIVEN AND SKARNER ARE!\n{{champion:122}} Yes Queen of the Bananas Soraka!\n{{champion:86}} BANACIA!\n{{champion:75}} DIE! BE FIRE, BE PURGED.\n(Suddenly, all the bananas are hitting a single spot, and there is so many explosions in the circle, that it seems that Skarner and Riven disappeared with the explosions.)\n{{champion:16}} Vayne, your end is near. Goodbye, friend. Boys, ready up, time to fight Vayne.\n{{champion:67}} Not yet. Lee, come forth. Zed, come forth. Lee begins throwing Sonic Waves at quick speeds, blowing up the bananas before they can hit Vayne.\n{{champion:238}} What shall I do Vayne?\n{{champion:67}} Assassinate Soraka.\n(Zed suddenly throws a shadow where Soraka is, and teleports to it. Soraka, caught by surprise, is hit by a sheer number of blades and shurikens.)\n{{champion:16}} Heh... too bad... \n(Soraka falls down and Zed teleports back to where he once was with Vayne, the bananas stopped shooting, and Riven and Skarner are badly hurt.)\n{{champion:16}} No. No. It's too bad, that I refuse to die.\n(Soraka places a silence zone so large, it covers all the members of the group, and they can not use any abilities on Soraka. Soraka heals herself back up, as the boys behind Soraka watch in awe.)\n{{champion:16}} Zed, bye.\n{{champion:238}} ...\n(Zed can not speak due to the silence zone, and everyone is looking at eachother, trying to communicate, but they are snared.)\n{{champion:16}} DIE.\nSoraka begins punching Zed as hard as he can, deforming his helmet. The shadow disappears from Zed, and Zed is on the ground, unable to move. Soraka begins stabbing her staff into Zed.\n{{champion:16}} Don't ever god damn mess with the bananas Vayne. Time for you to die.\n{{champion:1}} Let's play a game!\n(Annie throws Tibbers on Soraka, and a glow of gold disappears into the air, and creates a symbol in the sky.)\n{{champion:16}} I expected that, so I took some training.\nSuddenly, the symbol in the sky glowed yellow, and filled miles away. Suddenly, bright yellow energy FLEW DOWN into the ground, annihilating anything that was near. The boys that helped Soraka were shielded, and healed with immense strength and energy. Meanwhile, Vayne and Zed dissipated from the blast, and so did Skarner, Annie, Riven, and Lee Sin.\n{{champion:16}} Well, my work here is done.\n(After that, they all leave the area in one piece, and all the members of the group NerfThisWonderland are dead.)\n\n{{champion:67}} No... I can't die.. Zed, get out of it... We can.. still.. live..\n{{champion:238}} .. Wh-... -at? Am.. I.. Alive?\nZed helmet is bashed, and his shurikens are split in half.\n{{champion:67}} We can... still... live... \n(BANG!)\n{{champion:222}} Die, bitch. Also, see you later Zed.\n(Jinx shoots a large rocket at short range at Zed, blowing him up immediately.) \n{{champion:60}} Good work Jinx, good work. We have more to destroy. Mordekaiser, revive them all, and put them on our side.\n{{champion:82}} Yes Elise. Our plan has worked by tricking Vayne.\n{{champion:117}} Yup! \n(Lulu starts eats a part of Vayne's brain, making her unable to remember anything.)\n{{champion:60}} Good Lulu, heh. Cannibalism at it's finest, eh?\n{{champion:117}} It tasted purple!\n{{champion:82}} Come back Vayne, on our side. (Mordekaiser revives Vayne, and makes her a slave.)\n{{champion:67}} Hello. I am Vayne, now working for you. How may I help you?\n{{champion:82}} Don't do shit, bitch. Just stay there.\n{{champion:67}} Yes, master.\n{{champion:60}} Lulu, bite the rest of them.\n\n**1 year later...**\n\n{{champion:45}} We don't have a chance.. Soraka is dead, for real this time... Soraka... Why did you try to fight them...\n\n{{champion:106}} Veigar... It seems, that the battle is lost...\n{{champion:6}} I tried Veigar... Everyone else is dead, and I will soon be with them.\n{{champion:60}} Anything else you got Veigar?
