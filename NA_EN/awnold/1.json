How about we delete the chatbox and just bind certain Riot/Community approved phrases to F1-F9?  That'll eliminate toxicity, I bet!

I'm guessing you're one of those people that see the problem and ignore it or label it and slap an excuse on it.\n\nI think you're confusing toxic behavior with taunts, mate.  They're two different things.  Professional athletes taunt each other.  Kids taunt each other.  Friends taunt each other.  Calling someone a filthy n!gger jew cock lover degenerate who should kill himself immediately is toxic behavior.  Saying someone sucks at the champion they're playing, or that you're better than them, or that this game is easy, is a taunt.\n\nBut whatever.

If you don't want to get better and just want to mess around then normals are probably the best place to play. However, I didn't really start improving at the game until I did ranked and hit bronze, and had something to measure my progress by. If you focus on learning just a couple champs so you're comfortable w/ the champ you play, you can pick up the macro game/pressuring objectives pretty easy. 70% of accounts are below gold, so it's not a bad thing to be bronze/silver if you're still having fun and if you take it as an opportunity to grow and measure your improvement rather than something to be frustrated at when you struggle.\n\nI've played since s3 in ranked and I'm still only gold, but I've learned to be calm about it and I've become a much better player. For me, it's more fun to play now because I see all the things I had no idea about where I could play better when I was bronze (hell I was so out of practice from quitting for a while mid/end of season 4 that I started this season in bronze). I see where I can do better and so even if I lose I have stuff to work on, and when I predict something 2 minutes before it comes down the line I feel super proud that I've improved enough to understand game flow and where things are going. Season 3 I got gold, but it was bc my play style was in meta so I was decent. Even then though I didn't understand game flow that well, I just memorized common patterns and could exploit predictable play, I couldn't adjust to how people played different from game to game, and so getting gold was super hard and frustrating. Now it doesn't seem bad, I just did the climb from bronze to gold on a second account and had a 60% win rate even though I played a lot of new stuff or things I wasn't good at and wanted to improve on.

From what it looks like on your ranked stats you main split push and farming champs (nasus and udyr) so you probably have a decent sense of how to pressure the map and force teams to focus more attention on you while your team can 4v3 or 4v2 on the other side and get objectives. Yas plays super different to that and it's probably not a strength of yours to play a super squishy champ that has to do dmg and use mobility/wind wall to survive. You average like 10 deaths a game on yas in ranked so even though you're 8-3 I'm betting he's not a strong champ for you bc if you're like me you forget you're not tanky like usual and can't survive what you think you can. Don't sweat someone who obviously doesn't have macro play down just bc your strength is in controlling game flow and pressure rather than mechanics and carrying. There are probably a ton of silver players who can crush me in lane, but I'd rather win than stomp my opponent and I'm better at pushing a team advantage than my own, so I don't mind weak mechanics if I can play safe and get wins through team play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"High5","date":"2015-09-15T07:10:00.459+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I could pick a random champ, read a mobfire guide during the loading screen and not feed.

If the bronze 4 beat someone that, in all honesty, SHOULD be beating him, then he has the right to gloat a little in my book. If anything, you being so upset with the situation actually says something about you, especially since you decided to bring it here and essentially said 'feel bad for me, I had a bad game and someone told me so.'\n\nAnd to everyone saying \"Just cause I'm a high rank doesn't mean I'm perfect\" or \"I'm just trying to enjoy myself in normals\": Then do so. If someone commenting on a bad play you made with a champion you are learning or when you are trying to have fun is effecting you that much, you need to take a fucking break. If you lose to people who are a lower rank than you in these situations and they get happy about it (who wouldn't? Wouldn't you feel happy beating a Challenger player even if he was having a bad game? I know I would, I'd be stoked), tell them good job, or hell, try to exploit the plays they are going to make (chances are you're ACTUALLY better and have more knowledge of the game to do so).\n\nAnd fuck, if you can't go through with any of that, when you leave the game you still have a shiny medal saying you are better than him at the end of the day. \n\nTL:DR: Stop being a baby and enjoy the fact that you are a better player than him at the end of the day.
