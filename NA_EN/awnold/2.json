Also, if she would heal over 100% missing HP, she gets a shield for the remaining duration that acts like a Thornmail for spells, which of course, does true damage. It doesnt just do true damage tho, it does (amount of damage a spell would have done) x (0.06/0.07/0.08/0.09/0.1) % HP true damage. So, if a spell would do 1000 damage against Poppy, she instead absorbs it and deals 1000 x 0.1 = 100% max HP true damage.\nI think her W could spawn that \"zone\" when it gets activated.\n\nSeriously tho, Im looking forward to that rework, I bet itll be cool.
