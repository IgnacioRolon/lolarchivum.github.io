We're keeping them fairly constrained because we don't want to create cases where you feel you can't take dragon because of which one spawned. Our goal is to find effects that can be optimized around, or taken advantage of, but have only moderate sized impact. Current mechanics are:\n\n* Fire - AOE damage (just like current dragon). Impacts positioning when taking dragon primarily, some impact on pet users.\n\n* Water - Auto attacks slow. Mainly relevant if it's a potentially contested dragon, since the slow will limit your ability to disengage quickly. Some optimizations around getting it to attack an enemy for the slow situationally. \n\n* Earth - Slow hard hitting auto attacks that also AOE. More health, armor and MR than other dragons. Slower to take, giving longer windows in which to contest it.\n\n* Air - Fast moving and fast auto attacking. Highest single target damage, chases better than other dragons.","replies":[{"poster":"Solari Fortune","date":"2016-04-20T00:55:59.804+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now what about that Elder Dragon, what does it bring to the table when we go toe to claw with that beast","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stan Dahyun","date":"2016-04-20T00:45:34.916+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"How Will the Dragons affect Mordekaiser passive.
