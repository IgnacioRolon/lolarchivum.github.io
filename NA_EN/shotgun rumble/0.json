I reinstalled league on my 2nd HDD i use for all my games now. so now league is installed just like all the rest of my games to my 2nd hard drive, client has been downloaded, everything seems to be working as normal... then...\n\nPROBLEM - \n\nAT RANDOM! looking through the runes, champions, clicking around, looking at gifts, literally anything on the menu, and at random, my 3 monitors will turn off and go into standby mode, keyboard turns off, mouse turns off, all peripherals become bricked, the pc is running and can not turn off when pressing the power button. I need to hard reset and turn off the psu. after computer boots back up, it runs like it never even had a problem...\n\n- computer has never crashed like this before, EVER.\n\n- computer does not crash when playing other games such as civ 6, csgo, killing floor, h1z1. this is only happening for league of legends.\n\n- it literally happens randomly, its happend 8 times since i got my league running, cannot pinpoint further, it only happens on the menu when im clicking around threw the tabs, it does not happen when in game or champion select or anywhere besides in the menu.\n\n- when loading into matches my whole computer lags like crazy, discord audio becomes choppy/fragmented, mouse is super slow and 1-2 seconds behind when i move it. after the game loadin screen appears the lag stops, it only happens for around 30 seconds\n\n- yes i can play matches, without any problems after the lag when loading into the game\n\ni built my pc in 2014 here are the specs:\namd fx8350 processor \ngigabyte gtx970 g1 gaming gpu \nripjaw 1866 ddr3 ram \ngigabyte 990fxa-ud3 motherboard \nrosewill lighting 800w psu \nsamsung evo 840 250gb ssd \nwestern digital caviar black 1 tb HDD \nkracken x61 water block with double rad cooler \n\nI also have the latest GeForce game ready drivers: \nVersion\t375.63 - WHQL\n\nI am also on Windows 10 64bit\n\nAfter all my googling and searching for a topic, i am finally posting on here because i cant find anybody who has experienced this problem.\n\nif this would have happened 1 time outside of the league client, i would know its a problem with my computer and not a league of legends issue, but its only in the menu after I log in... what in the menu could be tripping up my computer and causing it to crash like this at random when selecting things?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-25T21:16:19.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suspect there may be a program running in the background that could either causing this or at least exacerbating it.

CPU usage is low, disk is fine, memory checks out OK as well, but the only trend i see is the network spikes the second of crashing.\n\nis there a way to limit the amount of network resources that lolclient.exe is allowed to draw from? or would there be a newer driver for my computer that might stop this \"spike\" from occurring? how would you approach this? any way for the client to show the crashes in logs somehow?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-26T20:21:48.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm..

(mine was windows 10)\n\n3. run uninstaller to remove all GeForce drivers on your system (this should automatically restarts your computer)\n\n4. once your signed back into your computer, install manufactures GeForce drivers (this will install newest GeForce Experience)\n\n5. launch league of legends and enjoy not having the client crash on you :D","replies":[]}]}
