I am in awe of them all >:D\n\nSince they seem to be two different teams, have you guys considered using some of the skin splash teams power tp bolster up the one that does the updated classic splashes? The splashes for the skins really seem to almost always be on point, but some of the new classic skins have been pretty embarrassing downgrades over their old ones (i.e. Katarina/Janna/Ahri) which i reckon might be due to less ressources given to that team.\n\nThe new Anivia splash however looks pretty great, so maybe you have solved that problem already! It would just be nice if things like the hilariously forced PoV in the Katarina splash wouldn't happen again in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2015-07-03T05:47:25.284+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"All the splash art is done by the one team.","replies":[{"poster":"Tendrian","date":"2015-07-05T13:23:35.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Huh, that's actually surprising, given the large difference in quality between skin splashes and updated classic splashes over the last year... then again, it might have simply been a problem of putting out too many of them in too short of a time frame.\n\nAs I said, I think the new Anivia splash looks pretty amazing, so I just hope the team will be able to stick to that standard of quality in the future when it comes to base splashes. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2015-07-05T22:15:42.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's always going to come down to the individual artist as well.
