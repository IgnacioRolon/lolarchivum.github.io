Sadly, those icons were only given out during the event, which ended in Sept of 2015. \n\nI went ahead and double checked for those matches to see if you qualified, but I'm only seeing one match played which was this year when it was in the rotating game mode. Since this account didn't play during the event, we won't be able to give out those icons anymore.","replies":[]}]}
