The question is why are you buying these items? Yes it is for Crit and AS obviously but the Unique Passives are what matter. There are 4 options for AS and Crit (5 if we're counting trinity) in a similar way that there are 4 armor/health options, 4 mr/health options, multiple AP/CDR items etc... I could go on with offense/defense hybrid options but those are much more limited because they are hybrid... At the end of the day the things that make these items worth buying over each other is what they have for passives... So are they similar? Yes. Is one completely outclassed by the other? No. Shiv has aoe and thus less damage... Cannon has range and thus single target... but here's the kicker: Shiv can crit... Cannon can hit towers... If you want to take towers and have safe reliable damage then Cannon is the way to go; if you want to clear waves and have riskier but potentially much larger damage (keep in mind this scales with crit modifiers; IE) then Shiv is the way to go. The reason you see Cannon more than Shiv is that waveclear can be obtained elsewhere (if it's not already built into a kit) and safety and reliability is highly valued. The more crit you build (Shiv + IE + another crit item +) the better Shiv scales; Cannon doesn't have that scaling. And to answer your question of who wants Shiv over Cannon right now: Quinn would way rather have waveclear and potential burst imo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mansana","date":"2015-12-11T23:45:21.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot said they want to look into Shiv giving more wave clearing efficiency.
