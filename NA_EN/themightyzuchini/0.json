I have the rp to change but I want to use that to buy skins and other things. I have tried reloading my client multiple times and it has not changed if you could give some helpful tips I would appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-29T19:22:26.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This may be a sync issue if you're on the updated client.  Hop back on to the legacy client to fix this up:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nThat should help with changing your name!","replies":[]}]}
