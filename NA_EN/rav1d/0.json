What the heck? That's the only nid skin I like and it disappears right before I can buy it??? Is this a glitch? And is there any way I can be allowed to buy it since it was on display today?\r\n\r\nLike I'm pretty ticked off, thats the reason I bought the RP. I'm about to have it refunded","replies":[{"poster":"Tentacle Love","date":"2015-01-07T21:24:03.474+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the wintersday skins were on sale only until 1/6. The poro wards are still on sale until the end of the month though. You could try contacting customer support. Since there was a period of time that gift cards couldn't be redeemed, they might be willing to trade your rp for the skin. Try being polite though. You'd be surprised how far it will get you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rav1d","date":"2015-01-07T21:53:49.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well can they let me buy it 1 day late?
