I spent much of last night and today reading yours and the rest of the community&#039;s thoughts on the changes to get a good grasp of where to go with Garen for the next iteration, which takes us to today&#039;s changes. There was a lot of consistent feedback on certain elements of yesterday&#039;s changes, so today&#039;s changes aim to address some of those concerns. \r\nThe main goals of today&#039;s changes are:\r\nAddress Judgment&#039;s relatively low counterplay in a way that gives more gameplay to Garen and opponents, rather than just taking gameplay opportunity from Garen (as in the last set of changes)\r\nReduce some of the weirdness with the changed W passive. It isn&#039;t really intended that Garen feels like a champion that needs to invest heavily into &#039;farming up&#039; a ton of minions (much moreso than other champions, anyway), but we do feel this W passive is a good direction for two main reasons: flat resistances synergize well with Health scaling that Garen has on his passive and other items_**, and as a champion recommended for beginners, it teaches some of the importance of farming.**_&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nRIOT, you do NOT make characters specifically aimed at new players. There are champions that are easier to learn the basics of for new players, but this? \r\nYou&#039;re creating an aspect to the ability that doesn&#039;t really fit with the character&#039;s style (farming for stats) to teach beginning players that they should farm. What the hell? That feels like an injustice to all of the players who know that farming is worth doing, and you&#039;re assuming that a new player will A.) play Garen and B.) read the tooltip.\r\nEven so, there are far more important and ubiquitous reasons to farm minions, and if you want beginning players to know them, TELL THEM. Make a graph or something and put it in the tutorial. This just rubs me the wrong way.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-19T03:37:22.091+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":3,"body":"I don't actually see what is wrong about stating that a champion is recommended for beginners.

You can kill him 10 times in the first 20 minutes and it means crap since he will still require 2 people to babysit him else out of nowhere he will have 500-1k stacks and watch as he one shots everyone.\n\nGaren is going to basically become the same thing, he will just farm til he has extremely high stacks of armor then run in and lol as he murders everything, stop him if you can, but unless you are willing to have 2 people baby him, it will still mean you lose.\n\nThis is what doesn't work. I don't care so much about the beginner blah blah, look at Annie, she is beginner class and she is more than capable of Challenger and even LCS class of champions. Also how is it working with his actual character? How is him, a proud knight getting more sturdy by killing weak minions?\n\nAnd this is why I mostly gave up on Garen, I love the way he is now. He is tough but not invincible, he also has no hard CC so he can be ignored. If the mid and carry die, garen isn't doing anything fancy. It just makes me sad this is basically an overall nerf to him and yet Darius which mind you, is hardly weak, he is like the only one left capable of fighitng Riven which shows he is one of the best tops is getting a mega buff just cause \"Ohh no i missed my axe grab and literally have no way to escape\" And \"I can't pentakill since my dunking can only do so much, Let's make it so Riot spoon feeds darius players and give them free max stacks of bleed\" While we are at it Riot, can you wipe those Darius player's asses as well?","replies":[{"poster":"Sulghunter","date":"2015-08-19T07:53:07.134+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The new W passive has a hard cap.

One of the reasons I like Garen is mechanically he is simple. The problem is with the rework he is much less beginner friendly (and probably is no longer a beginner champion). The Villain mechanic is a trap mechanic that shouldn't be on a beginner champion (or at the very least one like Garen who has no ways to take advantage of the villain mechanic outside of his mark being out of position). And the update has emphasized his strengths for even more pronounced weakness (no tenancity, shorter silence, extra tankiness is a stacking mechanic), which makes him much more reliant on good positioning and knowledge of when he can engage. \n\nThe way I see him now I think he will do well in mid gold and above just because that is where you see the knowledge necessary to actually use Garen's strengths, but will probably be a bad choice low gold and below (and a bad choice for beginners) because they don't have the knowledge to play around his weakness to take advantage of his strengths and not fall into the villain mark trap.","replies":[]},{"poster":"seraph1m","date":"2015-08-19T05:11:26.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=IzME3EG5,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-08-19T03:37:22.091+0000)\n>\n> I don't actually see what is wrong about stating that a champion is recommended for beginners.

Ideally, every champion shouldn't be too hard to pick up, but should offer endless potential for mastery, and that's a rationale Riot has stood by for quite some time now. Some champions are definitely going to be easier than others, and {{champion:86}} is likely never going to be as difficult to play as, say, {{champion:432}} or {{champion:61}}, but that still doesn't mean he should be geared towards lower-level play, particularly since there are a heap of other factors that would do a much better job of smoothing out the learning curve (e.g. better tutorials, improvements to the summoner leveling experience, changes to the rune system that wouldn't make it such a large and unintuitive barrier of entry, even Garen's own autoattack animation, which has a very irritating base delay and an additional \"cast time\" when empowered with Q).\n\nWhile the changes to Garen are pretty good overall, I feel the W farming mechanic is the biggest pitfall to his rework: the power it gives isn't too visible, which also doesn't really help in terms of encouraging new players to farm (last-hitting 60 creeps for a free {{item:1029}} isn't particularly thrilling), and it takes power away from what could be more interesting power elsewhere. Garen, both now and in his upcoming rework, suffers from utility that doesn't increase in power, but instead increases in duration as he ranks it up, which means that instead of having, say, powerful clutch damage reduction or movement speed in the late-game, which would really help him express his power even if he'd end up with less overall resilience or mobility, he ends up with okay-ish bonuses that drag on over up to 6 seconds, which also means he can't really get his cooldowns to the low amounts he'd want. If he lost his upcoming resistance bonus but instead gained, say, 30 to 70% damage reduction for 2 seconds (or a more reasonable 30 to 50%) on a 24 to 16 (or 24 to 12)-second cooldown, he'd be able to produce situational tankiness that would be much more visible overall (though which would probably still use improvement) than his 30 additional resists, and which would offer up much better rewards for clutch ability use.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2015-08-18T23:26:43.615+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"i dont care why they did it. the new w passive is better than the current one, except for some nieche cases.\n\nescpecially since armor items are getting the shaft.\n\nby the way, the rioter in question also talked with high ranked garen mains (yes, thats a thing even before the rework) about the changes. and that resulted into the removal of the self slow and certain other changes. so while his first iteration as frankly terrible, hes not just geared towards beginners now.\n\ni just hope theyre putting the increased resistance bonus from jungle monsters back. jungle garen looked kindof fun with that villain mechanic. youre basically getting a huge advantage against lanes that are already ahead and make ganks more likely to succeed.\n\nand if the enemy jungler is marked its a good time to invade and counterjungle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Fast","date":"2015-08-18T23:34:14.830+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you actually think that they created new Garen specifically for new players? Garen was problematic for several reasons, and they worked to address that while keeping his nature as a simple champion that new players can use to learn the game, while also helping him become a champion with a more defined competitive use.\n\nThe passive is fully stacked at 120 minions. This means that by 15 minutes, you'll have 30 bonus armor and MR, worth roughly 1500-2000 gold or so. This is a change with far reaching consequences beyond \"teaching new players.\" Instead of making his W \"get more from things you buy,\" it is now just \"get things for farming,\" which you should be doing anyway. It provides a power curve, and earlier resistances to survive and outduel. Garen can now put off buying magic resist longer than before. Garen can now put off buying armor longer than before. This makes skipping sunfire and heading straight to Black Cleaver more realistic. His new W is also better than his old W in terms of resistance gained until he crosses 150 bonus armor or MR, which generally means Garen is MUCH better against magic damage, while his armor got hit substantially, but it also means that his mid-game is much stronger in terms of damage tankable, and makes early dives much easier for Garen.\n\nIts not just \"for the new players\" there are a lot of things that this changes for higher end players too.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2015-08-18T23:44:20.007+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Knight Kore,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=IzME3EG5,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-08-18T23:34:14.830+0000)\n> The passive is fully stacked at 120 minions.
