Let me explain now: The game starts on summoners,or howling abyss and after like 1 minute into the game,or even 2 minutes,when minions are already fighting I get a lag spike when I use an ability,it MIGHT not be EVERYTIME I use an ability but 90% of the time it is.As the game gets going 15+ mins,it starts to be really annoying that when I use Lissandras E to escape,in the instace that I press it,my MS goes from 40 to 120-100 in a second,not allowing me to reactivate the spell,because of the lag-because of which I die.Its really frustrating,I just want to know if anyone else is experiencing this or If this is my ISP`s fault or its from the patch(Rito pls).Thanks for reading! Have a wonderful day y`all!{{item:3073}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-17T22:45:19.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, thanks for reaching out to us.
