Poppy would gank bot lane and Draven would suddenly be wallpinned. \r\nChased a low Poppy through the jungle, she disappeared for 2 second until she used an ability. Was not in bush. \r\n\r\nMade the game unwinnable due to everyone fearing a Poppy at all times. We ff&#039;d that game. \r\n\r\nFeelsbadman.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot LoveStrut","date":"2016-10-07T20:51:19.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That...is definitely not intended. No one wants EvePoppy (well maybe the Poppy players, but no one else). If you would like to, when this happens, you can find the R3d log for the game at C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Logs\\Game - R3d Logs, which you can attach here. No guarantees that it'll reveal the answer for us, but it can certainly help out. This seems like such a weird, uncommon issue, so it might take some help to figure out how to repro this exactly.\n\nAlso do you have any details on the game like was there a Poppy on both teams? Did you have any issues when patching up the client? Has a similar issue happened before for you?","replies":[{"poster":"DarkEcho6","date":"2016-10-14T01:31:26.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had no issues with patching. And this is the first time this has happened to me. \n\nSome more info on it, Poppy did not appear on the minimap either when she was invisible. I was moving towards bot side jungle looking at the minimap when Poppy appeared on our tower killing Draven I believe. \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1c_t3cScEsajYEpMj3F2MFsvI7a0F4hEophjwEe2pQNk/edit?usp=sharing\n\nThere you go.
