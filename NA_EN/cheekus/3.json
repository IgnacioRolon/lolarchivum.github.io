I keep clicking it and the \"League of Legends\" title appears but after that nothing happens, there is not even a loading symbol on my dock (I have a mac btw). What should I do to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-24T00:49:47.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We experienced some live service issues yesterday that may have caused this.
