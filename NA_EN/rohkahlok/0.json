I tried typing \"/remake\" when no prompt came and i got a message along the lines of \"You can only remake if a player has failed to connect\", yet Nasus was standing afk in base. He only reconnected after 30 minutes, right before the other team ended. I lost 20 LP by managing to stretch a 4v5 up to 30 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"mærk","date":"2019-05-20T22:15:28.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is possible he lagged and was sort of clicking on the screen registering as if he was still there. The game is dumb like that, thinks a person isn't afk from actually being afk. You can sit foundation and click once ever few minutes and won't get red flagged by the afk system.\n\nBest thing to do is report for afk afterwards and move on.","replies":[{"poster":"Galaxyburstz","date":"2019-05-20T22:44:39.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why would you report someone who is suffering from connection issues? I think submitting false report claims should be a punishable offense so that players are more careful when wasting the time of manual situation examiners while actual offenders can be properly evaluated and have justice played out accordingly\n\nJust my cup of tea\n{{sticker:sg-poppy}}","replies":[{"poster":"mærk","date":"2019-05-20T22:56:15.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot states you should have a strong connection and devote at most 45 minutes to a game prior to starting one. If we were to be cynical about everyone who claims lag and or having connection issues, then Riot would give green passes to millions of players. You'd see millions of appeals of players just having connection issues instead of wanting to ragequit so they afk the game because they're mad. \n\nHey, I know people have connection issues. If you're deciding to play League while there is a natural disaster, would you still be not punishable if you suddenly lost power to the internet because you rather not evacuate? Now your team is left to 4v5 because your power went out or you lost connection. It's a very tough dilemma that's why Riot doesn't have a say if you play w/ good/bad connection. They keep the 'Offense' very board so it covers everything not just a very specific reason to report someone.\n\nNot every game will be perfect and or everyone will have high speed internet w/ 2080 GPUs, you still have people playing on i3s or worse yet they enjoy playing the game. Are you saying they can enjoy the game but still lag/have computer issues because it's not compatible with League's recommended settings? If so, you are super nice and you need to become the Community Spokesman so everyone can be nice and peaceful.\n\n\nAlthough I am not saying you aren't wrong to lessen the punishment for those who do disconnect, I have witnessed and suffered from it, it goes to show, play at your own risk and you should be held responsible for your actions.

They favor no one. If they favored people who do have issues, not saying they don't (clearly 90% of players do as they don't have the same rigs as the pros who makes a living off it or those who can afford that luxury) then we will have a worse system we would now.\n\nI would agree with you on not punishing players because it isn't entirely their fault. We have technology to determine if a bad storm is coming, power outage is random, etc etc, so most things are preventable. It's just the addiction of players wanting to play when they shouldn't. Before finals of college, students will prefer another game of League over their studies or exam, etc. It's the honest truth. \n\nWhat does that mean? If they do poor on the exam/finals, they don't get the excuse of retaking because they wanted to do something else. This analogy is basically stating, have fun but be responsible. It applies to both situation well as in both situation both person wants to enjoy a little more self freedom and or being able to do what they want and if something bad comes as a consequence they should own up to it.\n\nNot many and hardly any player reads the ToS but it states that you are responsible for such cases as you should only play when you can. If you were to go AFK for 10 seconds to go open door and your team mates blames you for AFK'ing the fight or whatever, who's fault is it? Your team to having to 4v5 or YOU for not being focused when ToS states you should be uninterrupted and have minimum 45 minutes or so of a game, per game.\n\nAgain, we all agreed to the terms and conditions,agreements,services. Nothing we can really do, AGAIN I agree with you about a lighter punishment but then you'd be dodging a loophole and would be trying to avoid the issue at hand; people can then abuse that ability to be punished lightly. i.e. A player's intention in which you do not know, wants to stop playing the game because he feels cheated of his role, champion and or having a say in his team, so he leaves. People perceives is as AFK or maybe he disconnected, his intentions are with him and not us as we do not think for others, therefore it isn't right if he can claim he disconnected to avoid the real punishment.\n\nPlus Riot's AI algorithm report system doesn't know what is human or not, we're all treated the same. 10101010101010101 or whatever, binary numbers. We aren't real to the system. Therefore the System shouldn't be Real with us.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
