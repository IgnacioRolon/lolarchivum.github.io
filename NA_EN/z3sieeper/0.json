His entire shtick is statchecking opponents and when he can't statcheck, to fall back on last hitting from a distance with Q (which there's no real counterplay to, since blocking it takes a massive chunk of your health).\n\nMundo needs an update or a rework. His kit is simply way too uninteractive and stacheck heavy. Noone wants this thing to ever be viable. It's uninspired and uninteresting. It was fine back in the day where basically half the roster was nothing but statchecking (and his Q didn't refund the full cost so he was actually punished for being uninteractive), but it falls a goddam mile short of today's standards.\n\n---\n\nIf you want my full thoughts on Mundo from a year old post that's still relevant today [here you go](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Bj6XtbAG-there-are-so-many-things-you-could-do-to-make-mundo-more-interactive).\n\nAh but this sums it up (also from that post):\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Z3Sleeper,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Bj6XtbAG,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-08-05T07:05:39.310+0000)\n> \n> Stop trying to keep Mundo's current design a viable pick when it's a completely unhealthy and unfun design. Noone wants to play against this, whether he's weak or strong. Change *something* about him. Literally any interactivity change you make to Mundo will make his design *twice* as interactive as it currently is while also making it more fun and rewarding for the Mundo player when they execute their kit properly.\n\nAh another good quote from another post even longer ago:\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Z3Sleeper,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ugYBIW05,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-04-26T06:49:28.622+0000)\n>\n> What niche is he filling exactly? He's literally just a wall of meat that statchecks everyone and has a singular instance of interactive gameplay through his Q, which ironically makes him extremely uninteractive in lane since he just last hits with cleavers if he can't successfully statcheck yet.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2019-08-14T10:04:53.397+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> His entire shtick is statchecking opponents and when he can't statcheck, to fall back on last hitting from a distance with Q (which there's no real counterplay to, since blocking it takes a massive chunk of your health).\n\nThat's basically why I love playing him. I'm such an asshole.\n\nThough that's also mostly because I really hate top lane's rock-paper-scissor meta that's also on top of the game's crippling range meta, and I need a consistent tanky pick that I have some degree of control over my performance that at the very least doesn't just crash and burn whenever I didn't get into a favourable matchup. Mundo kinda fits that bill.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2019-08-14T10:01:23.224+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want him to get buffed in a viable state.

Mundo just fits my personality.. my playstyle. I am, at heart, a sadistic guy that loves completely overpowering people.\n\nNow I'm not saying this can't be balanced. I'm not saying I'm against updates or changes.\n\nI would love to see big changes to Mundo that give him counterplay so that he could actually be buffed into the meta and viable. I agree, with his 1 dimensional kit he can't be balanced. I wish it were changed so that I can chase the moment I long for. I'm not asking for him to be buffed into OP. I'm just asking for a realistic window where it takes too long to dawn on my opponent that I am, in fact, not trapped in here with you. You're trapped in here with me.\n\nThat's what I love about him. When R is on cooldown, I'm a farmer. When R is ready, I'm waiting for you to step just a little too close. I can't do that in the office I work in, but I can do that in LoL. If he's updated, he could be changed, balanced, to give me that feel again in a meta where it makes sense at least. I'm all for counter play. I'm all for checks and balances. I just want my insane axe murderer back.\n\nMy take: \nMundo early game is way.. waaaayyyyyyy too weak. Many champions that scale have weak early games but few-none even come close to how bad Mundo's is. Rank 1 R is suicide 80% of real situations no matter how many wards you have out. I can regen half my tot-health at the cost of a quarter current-health... when I have 1200 HP max? It doesn't sound as bad as it is. Mundo early game leaves him no option but to farm and run as a free kill. Khazix can 100-0 Mundo before level 11 in *one combo*. I have 1.3million Mundo mastery, tell me I'm wrong.\n\nMundo's team fight contribution is.... I'll get back to you on that. He doesn't have the same feeling Darius or Nasus has. There is no urgent need to avoid getting close to Mundo. ADC are afraid of him but is that unique to anyone? Name one champion ADC is not afraid to be in melee range of. If you are playing an ADC in team fight, you MUST avoid getting too close to Nasus, Darius, Chogath, Olaf, Garen. All Mundo is going to do is face tank your skill shots and keep you slow. Over a period of 30 seconds, Mundo has a great damage to defense ratio. Over a 12 second team fight play period, Mundo isn't doing shit. Doesn't take short term damage, doesn't deal short term damage. He can only outlast you over a period of time which means nothing in a fight window.\n\nMundo passive is trash. You think he heals a lot? No he doesn't.,It's because he's wearing S Visage and Warmog. Those items could heal anyone... There's nothing unique about that/him. Items like rejuv beads only apply to his regen stat (The same as any other champion), NOT the actual passive itself. His passive is a mechanic to compensate for his 'mana cost' as his abilities cost health. So when you look at it that way, he doesn't have a passive at all. His passive is mana regen. If his abilities cost 0 I wouldn't be able to say that but the cost of his skills negates the benefit of having a regen passive to begin with. Garen has the same passive but better and no health cost on abilities. Please tell me I'm wrong. His passive *kind of* works with his first item being Visage or Fire cloak (HP and defense stuff) but it's vastly underwhelming. Rank 5 cleaver cost 90 hp. Talk all you want about the refund, Garen doesn't spend 90HP to deal damage to you with abilities that aren't even skill shots.\n\n\nI'm not afraid of counter play mechanics. I'm not afraid of being balanced. His R is aptly named SADISM. Meaning I'M UNDER YOUR TURRET SMASHING YOUR FACE AND YOU CAN'T OUTRUN ME. That's why I play him. That feeling. Don't tell me it's any worse than Dar, Cho, Urgot (list goes on and on) ult, it's not. Those champions just accomplish the same thing Mundo ult does in less time. It's the rest of the big picture of his static kit that's the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"KlydeFrog","date":"2019-08-15T05:52:09.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Also you probably have never bought rylais and liandrys on him either","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2019-08-14T09:53:20.644+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Mundo needs a rework period.
