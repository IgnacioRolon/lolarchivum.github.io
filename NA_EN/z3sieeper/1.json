Nor should they be. They want to provide a high cap for those who are dedicated, but still make most missions accessible enough to be completed without needing to invest too much of your life into.\n\nIf you have real life responsibilities, good! But don't expect to be able to keep up with dedicated nerds who don't. As of last week, I have a newborn, and have since had to decline many a game invite. I don't expect to be able to complete all the missions anymore, as my life has different priorities. I go for the easy missions, and basically ignore the 15-game one, and still manage to make enough progress to achieve my goals. I don't see any right I have to demand that every single mission caters to my position in life.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2019-09-04T11:02:00.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's over a week to accomplish these missions, and anyone with 3-4 hours a day can finish them in 2-3 days....","replies":[]}]}
