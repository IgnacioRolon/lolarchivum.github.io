The first one is of my client club screen, I can't see the Krispitaria club at all. The second one is of my friends client and it shows the Krispitaria club and me in the list of the members and the leader of the club too. I don't know why, but it happened after the downtime for the clubs.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-15T23:37:42.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There were some issues with clubs when they reactivated after that downtime.
