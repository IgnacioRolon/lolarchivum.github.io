Yesterday I was playing and my wifi suddenly went away. I was waiting like 5 minutes for it to come back but it wouldn&#039;t. Sadly I had to leave the match, and Leaver Buster counts it as giving up. So if there&#039;s any way to fix it, Dear Riot Games do something.                                                              \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHave a Good day tho!","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-10-20T06:41:24.504+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fix what? how the system was intended to work? the system cant tell if your wifi went down, or if you just rage quit the game.\n\nWouldn't be able to tell if your wifi went down from ISP problems or if you just unplugged it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2018-10-20T06:49:24.733+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://xkcd.com/654/\n\n\"Gaming on wifi?

Even if they made a system that detected when your connection was bad and didn't punish you for it, it could be abused pretty easily by messing with your connection and purposefully getting a bad connection so you could rage-quit whenever you wanted. \n\nAlso, it doesn't matter than poor Wi-Fi made you leave the game. Your teammates still suffered from losing a player. The point of the Leaver Buster system is to make it so that there are fewer people who leave games playing at any given time, which includes the people who do so on purpose and the people with bad internet. If this doesn't happen very often, then it shouldn't affect you once you complete your five games. If your internet does drop out often enough to get you a harsher punishment, then the system is doing its job of protecting the other players from having to suffer through a 4v5.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2018-10-20T08:23:00.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look im not a boss programmer computer guru or anything.
