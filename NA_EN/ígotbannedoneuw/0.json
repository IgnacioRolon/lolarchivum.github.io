Throughout the experience of League, I&#039;ve become a flamer, a very sensible, easy tilted guy. Of course, the game had a lot of good times, we all know it. Even 1-year players know that league was better when they started. And, the game was pretty bad even last year... \r\n   So... why do we hate league :\r\n     I. The balance team SUCKS ASS. The ADC nerf was let&#039;s say, okay. But it&#039;s like a diet, you wanna look good, then don&#039;t do workout to lose weight just to legs for example... That is what league did, they left all the other cancerous over-powered %%%%s, but they nerfed the ADC. Turret nerfs? Dude, a level 6 MAOKAI tank 6 turret shots without any trouble, turrets were way under-powered, and now they did worse.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION: Tanks are really annoying, and a dive in the turret can make the enemy feel so weak and hopeless. I say turrets should deal at least 30% more damage, and to get 30%-40% more HP.  Also, make the in-base turrets inferno-style, to start with weak damage, scaling up in time to more and more, that can defeat a lot of tanks diving the turret. Let&#039;s say a Garen dive the in-base turret, well, after 5 seconds in, the damage of the turret should increase. I mean, we all know how stupid it is a tank to dive in the turret, it&#039;s like they are invincible. \r\n\r\n    II. Class champions. 1. Tanks should be the low damage, high durability initiator. Instead, right now they are a medium-high damage, with really high durability, and some of them even medium-high mobility (Garen, Warwick). Think about a Garen vs a Jhin, for example. THERE IS NO WAY JHIN WOULD WIN LANE. Let&#039;s be serious, we are not all faker&#039;s.\r\n\r\n        They should be like this:\r\n Initiator: HIGH\r\n Damage: LOW-MEDIUM\r\n Durability: HIGH\r\n Mobility: LOW-MEDIUM  \r\n    \r\n                  2. Mage class is really F-ed up. They have high damage in late, really low damage, and low mobility. They are not fun to play. Ziggs deal lots of damage, but he dies instantly and he doesn&#039;t have lots of mobility. Veigar is the worst thing ever, he can deal so much damage, without any brain. They should be like this:\r\n\r\nInitiator: MEDIUM (With stuns and shit)\r\nDamage: HIGH (NOT ONE-SHOT, HOW THEY ARE NOW)\r\nDurability: LOW (THEY ARE BELOW LOW RIGHT NOW)\r\nMobility: MEDIUM\r\n\r\n                3. Fighters are pretty balanced in my opinion, good amount of damage, pretty skilled, good amount of HP. They are how most of the champions should be. Jax is good, Darius is fine, but most of the champions lose to him. Ekko is a good fighter also. Not much to talk here, Riot, take this class as an example what a good balance is. They should be like this:\r\n\r\nInitiator: MEDIUM\r\nDamage: MEDIUM-HIGH\r\nDurability: MEDIUM\r\nMobility: MEDIUM\r\n \r\n              4. Assassins... Ah, my favorite. Zed is the best example, he is really an assassin, he goes in, and quickly out. In my opinion, their HP  needs to be lowered, and their mobility increased. The best outplay&#039;s can come in this example.  They should be like this:\r\n\r\nInitiator: LOW\r\nDamage: HIGH\r\nDurability: MEDIUM\r\nMobility: HIGH\r\n\r\n          5. Marksman, some of them are a little too op, but NOT ALL FOR CHRIST SAKE, the nerf was awful, not needed, we talked before. Vayne is pretty good right now, Draven needs adjustments, he needs more durability, as he dies instantly. There are lots of bad marksman&#039;s here: Ashe is weak, dies instantly, without any mobility; Corki&#039;s damage is really messed up, he has burst potential, but still. REALLY WEAK. In general, ADC&#039;S are good, the only adjustments that should be are for the tanks, I tried Ezreal vs Renekton, even though I can outplay with {{summoner:4}} , I died as he went in, burst me and out. They should be like this: \r\n\r\nInitiator: LOW-MEDIUM\r\nDamage: HIGH\r\nDurability: LOW-MEDIUM\r\nMobility: MEDIUM-HIGH\r\n\r\n      I am not even going to talk about supports since I have a chapter just for them. \r\n\r\n    \r\n     III. Shields, CC&#039;s and heals are way out of hand, most of the champion has at least one CC. And I think they are so stupid. I calculate the stuns I get in the enemy team... 4-5 CC&#039;s in the team, which are silence, stuns and slow. Stun, the most F-ed up SHOULD be nerfed. Think about a Lux and a Malphite. Lux just stuns a Master Yi let&#039;s say. Full combo him, after the stun is done, Malphite R Yi, completely destroying him. So.. either nerf stuns, or add more anti-CC items.\r\n\r\n   IV. Items. There are lots of items, I get it. But we need A LOT more, for more customization and more skill-based game.\r\n\r\n\r\n   V. For the very least, COMMUNITY. This is the shittiest thing about this game, all the tryhards in normals, all the feeders and all the trollers we get. Why? I don&#039; t blame the guy, I blame the game because it is making us going crazy. Do something about it, we are going to lose it. I can&#039;t even try new champions in normals as there is always some douche that flames me for trying it and feeds. When I try my best in a rank, there is an AP ASHE TROLLER in a ranked. I shut up about it, but when I see that it feeds my lane, I say &quot;You are a worthless scum bag, waste of life..&quot; and I GET BANNED. Yes, that is right. I had 4 accounts, I gifted one to my friend, that was 2 years ago, then in that new account, I got permanently banned from league. For being a human, I know. Spent 1500 hours on that account, and 350$. I made a new account... Because we are so addicted we can&#039;t quit. STOP banning people, instead mute them, not permanently. 50 games, mute. then 100. This will SURE stop the flamer, a ban is driving you into depression and anxiety. I was there, feeling that. I had a 0/15 mother fucker that went all tear items. I reported him to riot, yet, he still played 20 matches today. JESUS CHRIST RIOT.","replies":[]}
