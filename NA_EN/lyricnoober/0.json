You get an honor flair for your next game when you get honored. You aren't guaranteed to get something just for ranking up, but at different honor ranks, you unlock access to rewards. One of the good upcoming rewards for having Honor 5 is getting a higher step up in Honor 2 when it gets reset for the next season. It looks like next season has some [guaranteed rewards](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/honor) though! So that's something to look forward to.","replies":[{"poster":"lyricnoober","date":"2018-01-12T03:27:33.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i mean gift honor lv5 but i dont get it","replies":[]}]}]}
