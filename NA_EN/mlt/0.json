I figured my connection just timed out so I backed out of the store and tried again. This time it worked. A few minutes later I tried to add some RP into my account when the same picture appeared but this time it said something about not being able to connect to the CloudFare server and it showed my IP address as well as some other information. This has never happened before and I haven't done anything to my knowledge that could have gotten me a virus, so what's going on? Has anyone else had this issue? How can I fix this?\nUPDATE: It just happened again and here's what it says, \"That initial connection between CloudFlare's network and the origin web server timed out. As a result, the webpage can not be displayed.\" It then goes on to show the Ray ID, my IP Address, the Error Reference Number, and the CloudFlare Location.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-01T04:15:15.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you still having issues with this?

Roughly and hour later the issue seemed to fix itself, however I was unable to play yesterday so I wont know if the issue is still happening until sometime this afternoon. If it does continue I'll do what you suggested. Thank you for the help!","replies":[]}]}]}
