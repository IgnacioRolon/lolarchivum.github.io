I&#039;ve played across several accounts but here is the one I currently play on. http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Dodge+Lamb+SRT10\n\nIt&#039;s not to gloat or try to say I&#039;m better than other people, only to try and back up myself as a credible player that is genuinely interested in trying to help the champion.\n\nI have one very short and simple buff, but before I state it, I want to go over why I feel what I&#039;m about to say is a necessary change.\n\nI am actually very happy with Kindred&#039;s mini-rework (Despite being harsh about it early on), and I think the champ is almost at a great state of balance, but we could get even closer. Kindred is a champion that, if played proficiently, can out-duel and out-skirmish almost every jungler in the game, even the ones that many people consider hard counters (such as Elise, Kha&#039;Zix, etc.).\n\nWhat I&#039;ve actually noticed from the champion&#039;s release is that Kindred has not fairly often had times where beating other champs was a tall task, even with all the sustainability nerfs. I know some people are going to find that ludicrous, but the average Kindred player really does not understand the potential of the champion, which pains me to observe. The main issue is (who would've guessed) how Kindred is supposed to balance between getting stacks and pulling off successful ganks.\n\nUnderstandably, Kindred has a dash, albeit very small, that operates on a small cooldown window inside of Wolf&#039;s Frenzy. The issue is that, in the early game, this ability is on too high of a cooldown to have meaningful chase potential without red buff, and even with it, to be honest.\n\nTake the newest addition to the jungle, for example: Ezreal. While both marksmen, Ezreal is a champion that shines in the early game through his ability to enter a lane with Mystic Shot to apply his Red Buff from a large distance to slow, and close in with Arcane Shift for a strong burst combo, and finish them off with Essence Flux and his superior attack speed (At least early game, Ezreal&#039;s passive outshines Kindred&#039;s Q Attack Speed steroid quite heavily) whilst landing extra Mystic Shots.\n\nCompare this to Kindred, who typically only has time to land two Dance of Arrows.  They also miss a lot of bites from Wolf&#039;s Frenzy because most of the time you cannot be in position to maximize its damage output, and Mounting Dread can only be used as a finisher for a notable amount of damage. For a dash that&#039;s smaller on a champion with less range and less up-front damage, it&#039;s hard to get the kills you need to allow your team and yourself to get ahead on Kindred. It doesn't feel right for a champion _designed for the jungle_, compared to Ezreal, a champion who is not.\n\nKindred also has an average clear speed compared to the typical jungler, which gets progressively worse if you cannot find stacks in the early game. For a champion that&#039;s reliant on getting those stacks, they just don&#039;t feel nimble enough to get around the map and contest with their low movement speed.\n\nThere&#039;s a lot more points I want to make, but the longer I think about what I&#039;ve wrote, the more convoluted I feel my words become, so I&#039;ll keep it there.\n\nWhat I propose is to have Dance of Arrows cooldown inside Wolf&#039;s Frenzy changed from to 3/2.75/2.5/2.25/2 from 4/3.5/3/2.5/2. I think this allows for Kindred to be able to capitalize on their gank damage in a more timely fashion and keep up with those faster champions that can walk away due to Kindred&#039;s low base Range. I also feel that a change like this still allows for their jungle clear to be healthy as you will roughly always get the same amount of jumps per use of W as on current. And if we _really_ want to get nitpicky about separating a great Kindred player from an average, this also makes getting two jumps per camp at Level 2 much more consistent (based on how fast you can press Q after auto attacking, it&#039;s almost frame perfect status with a standard 13.5% AS page).\n\nI also think that it is possible to buff the cooldown of Dance of Arrows outside of Wolf&#039;s Frenzy to around 6 or 7 seconds (Likely the latter, maybe even 8) and possibly change the mana cost back down to 30 from 35. This would really help in allowing Kindred to move around the map a lot better to be able to contest stacks more often.\n\nKindred&#039;s problem has never been based around combat power, in my opinion. The typical player keeps saying that their ability to fight other champs is moot, or that stacks are impossible to get, and I feel that this issue stems directly from never really having the ability to move around the map well like other champions can, due to the combination of low base movement speed and lengthy early cooldowns on Dance of Arrows.\n\nI really hope to see input from a Rioter or from anybody interested in logically debating on my ideas. I&#039;ve been a diehard Kindred fan since their announcement and I want to see people be able to experience them without wanting to claw their eyes out.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Wav3Break","date":"2017-10-03T23:59:27.280+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":2,"body":"Don't have a lot of time to devote to this thread, but wanted to put in my 2 cents as the dev who last worked on her mini-update. \n\nIn short, I think you make a very reasonable argument. I too think that Kindred needs a bit more love to reach an optimal balance state. We have discussed buffing them recently, but they slipped in priority due to other stuff going (yay Preseason). I do believe we will be devoting time to them in the near future and that most devs on the Live Gameplay team feel that they need some love. \n\nNot sure if our analysis will land exactly where yours did, but you do bring up a valid angle. I know in the past that their Q cooldown was a very sensitive lever to tune due to how slippery they can become. I think we would have to spend a lot of diligence in validating if a Q buff is the correct direction to take their next set of changes. I think there is a lot to be improved in Kindred's mark mini-game still as well for instance. \n\nBase MS is also a pretty attractive lever to me at first blush as well. Hopefully we will have time to address their current state in the coming patches or right after Runes Reforged.","replies":[{"poster":"Bob the Toastr","date":"2017-10-04T02:58:11.102+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"If being slippery turns out to be a problem, maybe have the dash be a shorter distance when dashing away and a longer distance when dashing towards an enemy?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dodge Lamb Ò w Ó","date":"2017-10-04T02:23:21.149+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you for your response, I really appreciate it.

There's a reason Mobi's were so popular for a while pre-rework.\n\nEDIT: Also some decent skins please. Any of the ideas artwork posted to /r/kindred would do nicely.

It doesn't necessarily have to be a slow the moment you leave the circle. It could place a debuff on you if you leave the AoE, something like: If an enemy champ leaves Wolf's range, Lamb's next three auto attacks have special effects for ~2 seconds (extended by auto attacks made by Lamb). The first two auto attacks steal 20% of the target's movement speed, and the third auto attack deals missing %HP damage.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Blades in Exile","date":"2017-10-03T14:59:17.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This isn't really related to your discussion but what order do you level your abilities in when jungling as Kindred?

Though his item pathing is confusing because he's building shiv and cleaver at the same time right now which he doesn't usually do . . . but, he's also unnaturally fed, so there's that.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Blood Teller","date":"2017-10-03T13:33:17.786+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"All I want is their base movement speed buff (and maybe some armor to survive most of the jungler's damage, yes I'm looking at you Lee and Kz).","replies":[{"poster":"Dodge Lamb Ò w Ó","date":"2017-10-03T16:03:53.013+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lee Sin is actually not a tough matchup.
