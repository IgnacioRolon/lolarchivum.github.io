Vayne&#039;s Q is, especially combined with her W. Kai&#039;Sa&#039;s risk factor doesn&#039;t have enough mitigation either. While Vayne can spam invisibility during her ult, Kai&#039;Sa only gets 0.5 seconds of invis while basically front-lining. On top of that, Vayne&#039;s W proc&#039;s true damage and only takes 3 autos to do so. Kai&#039;Sa&#039;s passive takes 5 autos to proc and deals magic damage, which can be reduced. Kai&#039;sa&#039;s ult is also useless in anything other than a duel, while Vayne&#039;s ult can be used to duel or to teamfight. There is no reason to pick Kai&#039;sa over Vayne in any situation, and I think that Kai&#039;Sa will need some changes before she can become viable as the &quot;High Risk High Reward&quot; champion she was intended to be. A few changes I could suggest are:\n\n-Make her Q prioritize champions\n-Increase her AA range\n-Increase her E invisibility duration\n-Make her Living Weapon passive upgrades easier to obtain\n\nOf course not all of these at once, but applying some of these changes could really help Kai&#039;sa become her own champion instead of just being a discount Vayne.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-11T06:29:12.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Almost like Kai'sa is not meant to be anything like Vayne and fills a totally different role.","replies":[{"poster":"Leylania","date":"2018-03-11T06:39:44.711+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=U5LtA6l2,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-03-11T06:29:12.049+0000)\n>\n> Almost like Kai&#x27;sa is not meant to be anything like Vayne and fills a totally different role.\n\nUhm but she actually doesn't.
