He caught your &quot;Give a buff to champ then give a skin&quot; trend followed by the &quot;Let&#039;s gut their strengths after we sell those skins&quot; idea.\r\n\r\nI figured hey, maybe they won&#039;t do that to Vi, she&#039;s always been fair.\r\n\r\nThen it happened to my champ. Don&#039;t let this happen to any more champs. It&#039;s pretty terrible business practice and I&#039;m not falling for it again.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t expect an apology from Riot for the shady stuff they do, I don&#039;t expect any Rioter to answer (as they never do when you call them out on actual stuff they are guilty for) nor do I expect them to actually stop their honestly scammish behavior.\r\n\r\nJust gonna vote with my wallet and not purchase any skins till several months have passed and I can confirm it was just a regular skin they wanted ot put out instead of a &quot;Buff and Nerf Later&quot; skin.\r\n\r\nYou did it wish Ashe, Vi, and so many champs. I&#039;ve been tricked enough by this elementary school prank.\r\n\r\nAs a Vi main I don&#039;t care if you even make an Ultimate Skin for her. I won&#039;t be fooled again.\r\n\r\nOh, and since were nerfing Vi to be more in line with her class, how about Lee sin&#039;s movement and attack speed?\r\n\r\nOh forgot. LCS is currently running, my bad.\r\n\r\n(Even if you think the Vi nerf was &quot;Justified&quot; you can at least see the pattern here folks, this isn&#039;t 9/11 conspiracy theory, this is simple observation)","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-02-08T15:17:45.081+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So... besides last patch, it has been like 5-6 months since Vi's last change, and I doubt 5 off of her movement speed and .019 off of her attack speed is going to cause her to fade into obscurity.\n\nYou might want to take off your tinfoil hat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LongHair Fox","date":"2017-02-08T15:40:38.542+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is no communication between balance and skin teams at riot. We have even seen them nerfing champions before skins come out. The vi nerfs have also been due since patch 7.1 where riot began talking about them. So you can hardly say that they came as a surprise.\n\nLastly: vi only got buffed due to meta and jungle changes which are very hard to predict so that was likely not even on purpose.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheHappyReaperz","date":"2017-02-08T14:37:29.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://media1.giphy.com/media/3o7TKwJgF0v0JX5gys/200.gif#8","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mr Killalot","date":"2017-02-08T14:44:45.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"This commubity is oblivious to it too.
