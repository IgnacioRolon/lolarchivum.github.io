I have stopped buying champs along time ago. I put a lot of money into this game, more money than I likely should have, and until this game becomes unfun/unplayable I will likely buy more RP.\r\n\r\nWith that being said I know there is a Blue Shop coming out, and with it, a slight desire to actually care about my blue essence.\r\n\r\nIn regards I've read two topics, but am unsure on how \"legit\" this is, and if riot is going to \"Fix/patch/adjust\" ratios.\r\n\r\n**Link 1:** https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion/2RZacVBR-have-a-ton-of-ip-laying-around-not-sure-youll-have-enough-for-urfwick-when-preseason-hits-gamble?page=2\r\n\r\n**Link 2:** https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6xi6nt/how_to_get_84_more_blue_essence_preseason/\r\n\r\nI would love to actually do this and get some more bang for my buck with Blue Essence. Not sure if Riot is just gonna adjust the prices or conversion on it.\r\n\r\nBasically I don't want to sink all my IP into this and then have Riot announce that they are nerfing the conversion rate, or are going to do something with the accounts that did this.\r\n\r\nBasically I need to know this is ok to do. If it's going to get fixed and end up hurting my Blue Essence I won't be doing it, but if it's not cared about/ok to do then I will be doing this as much as possible.\r\n\r\nSo, I really hope I can get an answer on this.\r\n\r\n**Second Question:**\r\n\r\nAre our Rune Pages being sold against our wishes, or are we able to sell them if we want?\r\n\r\nBecause I've seen the video and I am a bit confused and not sure. I know the rate is 4 pages = 1 Skin (rounded up)\r\n\r\nHowever what if I want to keep all my pages? Or are they only refunding IP pages, or only rune pages?\r\n\r\nHonestly I have all the champs, getting a random skin (of any value) wouldn't really be fun, as it will either be a terrible skin, a over priced legacy skin, and/or on a champ that I don't play with and would only play with on ARAM/ARURF.\r\n\r\nI would rather just not have my rune pages disappear, or are they keeping rune pages around for those who want to have multiple ones? I know that you can edit the new runes in champ select, but I don't want to do that every time, especially because my computer lags a bit when in the champ-select screen and I rather not have to deal with loading up my runes-reforged each time. That and I don't even want to have to deal with forgetting!\r\n\r\nSo yeah, if anyone knows if its mandatory or voluntary that would be awesome!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-04T01:50:29.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"About that math, seems like you might have a decent way of increasing your BE totals with that little trick.

I rather just keep my 20 pages that I may or not need. I hope I have the ability to keep them.\n\nI might be getting a terrible trade in rune ip value, but at least I will still have comfort of having the rune pages, or at least I hope.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-06T01:31:36.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AFAIK, we're all keeping our rune pages to be used with the new system!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
