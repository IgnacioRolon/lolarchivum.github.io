We can hope they \"grow out of it\" but I fear it's simply the sign of the times. Many gamers never knew a time before the internet's existence in homes. (us old timers do) That said there are simply those older, but by no means wiser setting bad examples for the younger generations. \n\nPeople are desensitized to the anonymity of online discourse and proceed to act out in ways they very likely would not do in person. \n\nThe point that you're contending is this: People are too quick to snap at one another over a simple video game. It's entertainment. It's meant to be fun. A competitive mentality does not detract from the fact that games were created to be enjoyed. Not to insult and bully one another because someone gets set off over something. \n\nIt would benefit the League community, as well as society as a whole if people would simply get over themselves and get along. I include every one of us including myself in that statement. We all can do better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-10-22T01:41:41.116+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"How is it not being thin-skinned when some small bad thing happens on a game and you feel the need to flame someone for it over the internet?\n\nWhy not just ignore it and move on realizing not everyone plays perfect every game, or that he himself doesn't play perfect either, but instead he feels the need to flame everyone about it.\n\n\nHow's it not making a point?","replies":[{"poster":"Emilianisawesome","date":"2017-10-22T02:24:33.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I cant believe that I have to explain to you that the actions of your teammates have ramifications in a team based pvp game. How do you ignore the actions of your teammates when they are entirely detrimental to the chances of 4 other people having an enjoyable game. You cant just ignore the actions of another player in this game, idk how you can even suggest that as an option, their actions usher in consequences that the whole team shares. Its not about playing perfect, its about playing in a way that doesnt screw over your own team. Its not making a point because being thin skinned is a saying about not being able to take abuse being thrown at you, not about someones willingness to accept the consequences of another person's actions readily.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Pandemic Punch","date":"2017-10-22T01:37:18.456+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"What is worse are people like you who insult someone else.
