It's a HALF-REVERT to the buffs given to him last year. Originally, they gave him an extra 15% AP ratio to his ult (was 60%, now it's 75%), and +10 Damage to his Q. This isn't really anything to be honest. \n\nI also don't understand the nerfs because tbh, it's probably not going to do what Riot wants them to do. Karthus is still going to scale, and do it rather well at that, but that's what he was designed to do. The other problem, is that Powerfarming is Karthus's main Shtick outside of his ult. If JG Karthus is the problem in particular, then they need to make it so that Karthus actually has to interact with opponents to be able to succeed in the game. Maybe if you made it so that Karthus only gets mana back off *minions* (from the E Passive), but get increased mana back from *non-ultimate* champion kills so that he's rewarded for more than Farming, he'd probably be better balanced that way. \n\nThis is from someone who plays pretty much absolutely *nothing but Karthus*.
