Your routing may have changed as well causing a higher ping, but a traceroute can tell us more.  Download [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and run a route to the game server: 104.160.131.1.  Run it for about 5 minutes, replace the IP address with dashes on the first two rows only, and let me know what you find.","replies":[{"poster":"Devil Fuhrer","date":"2017-12-13T21:15:49.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"use to be stable at 60 which was acceptable. this is what i got . thanks for your help btw\n\n\n\n\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n\n|                             ---.---.-.- -    0 |  295 |  295 |    0 |    0 |    3 |    0 |\n\n|                             ---.---.-.- -    1 |  292 |  291 |    6 |   17 |  386 |    7 |\n\n|                               10.1.21.9 -    1 |  292 |  291 |    7 |   19 |  375 |    8 |\n\n|                              10.1.42.14 -    1 |  288 |  286 |    7 |   18 |  366 |    8 |\n\n|                               10.1.2.66 -    1 |  292 |  291 |    7 |   21 |  377 |    8 |\n\n|xe-7-0-5.usa.boca-raton.fl.brx-teracore01.cwc.com -    1 |  292 |  291 |   23 |   35 |  364 |   25 |\n\n|                   mai-b1-link.telia.net -    1 |  288 |  286 |   25 |   37 |  393 |   26 |\n\n|                  atl-b22-link.telia.net -    1 |  288 |  286 |   43 |   54 |  377 |   46 |\n\n|                  dls-b21-link.telia.net -    1 |  288 |  286 |   60 |   72 |  404 |   62 |\n\n|      riot-ic-315570-dls-b21.c.telia.net -    1 |  292 |  291 |  152 |  175 |  500 |  166 |\n\n|                          104.160.134.35 -    1 |  292 |  291 |  153 |  175 |  500 |  165 |\n\n|          ae35-br02.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 |  296 |  296 |  153 |  177 |  503 |  161 |\n\n|           ae1-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    1 |  292 |  291 |  153 |  174 |  482 |  166 |\n\n|                           104.160.131.1 -    1 |  292 |  291 |  152 |  174 |  478 |  164 |\n\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting & Cloud Provider","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-13T22:25:23.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happy to help, and thanks for the info here!  Review these logs, it looks like your connection is crapping out before ever leaving your network.  Your router is trying to signal out to the big open world but it's already rocketed to instability.  For this specific case, I highly recommend going over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help tune up your local network.  Once complete, another route should hopefully show signs of a healthier connection!","replies":[{"poster":"Devil Fuhrer","date":"2017-12-18T21:54:02.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey i ran the Netalyzr test and it has several things wrong with it..... how can i get the info to you?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
