When I use www.speedtest.net to test my connection, i find that I have a ping between 7 and 9, which i am led to believe is pretty good. I also have an upload speed of .93 mbps and a download speed of .95 mbps, which isn't the best but is also passable, I believe.\r\n\r\nI also use a laptop with 2.16 Ghz, and plenty of space. The only game I have on it is League, and I always close everything, run CCleaner, then use Razer Cortex to open League. Now, with all this effort, I don't understand why I am still Lagging.\r\n\r\nI know that as a Gaming Community, you guys probably know something I don't, so is there anything I can do to eliminate my LAG? \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\nME :)","replies":[{"poster":"2Rods","date":"2017-02-09T16:06:59.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be easier of you told us your in game numbers. Whats your average ping (MS) and fps? \nFollowing the tips on fps troubleshooting will probably help alot. When your in the game, go to settings>video> and move the bar to very low. That will instantly help you. Also always try to be connected via ethernet when possible and avoid similar frequencys being too close to your computer IE fans, remotes, certain lights...\nIm on a 4 year old Dell, running nothing special and i average 180FPS with a 21ms ping","replies":[{"poster":"Holganpower","date":"2017-02-09T19:48:57.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for responding!\n\nI put my ping in my message above, but thats from speedtest, do you know how to check my ping in game?\n And what do you mean by in game numbers? \nAlso, I had already turned in game settings to maximum performance, as in everything. \nI am going to try the ethernet route, as i was using wifi.\nYou said you are use a 4 year old Dell, what processor speed to do have?\n\nThanks for the help","replies":[{"poster":"2Rods","date":"2017-02-10T13:28:54.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The basic specs of the dell:\n Dell Inspiron 17R-5720 Laptop, 17.3\" HD+ LED with Truelife, Intel Core i5-3210M Dual-Core 2.5GHz, 8GB DDR3, 1TB SATA, HDMI, USB 3.0, 802.11n, Bluetooth 4.0+HS, Waves MaxxAudio 3, W7HP\n\nI purchased it refurbished in 2013 lmao.

Or have a relatively unobstructed path to the router (no concrete walls etc).","replies":[{"poster":"Holganpower","date":"2017-02-09T19:49:46.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, will try that","replies":[]}]}]}
