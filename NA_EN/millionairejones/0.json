I immediately get a \"Bug Splat\" without even a glimpse at the load screen. I'm on a Windows 10 System. It's a new device, and is capable of running this and any other modern game. I'm know running any known mods, plugins or additional aspects of the game. I'm not running a screen capture or record tool of any sort.\r\n\r\nI don't know what to do anymore and really just want to play the game again.\r\n\r\n**I have already**:\r\n\r\n* Turned off the Xbox App's record function.\r\n\r\n* Done an uninstall reinstall (twice).\r\n\r\n* Run Hextech Repair Tool (twice).\r\n\r\n* Changed DNS settings.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for any help you can provide.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-26T22:19:53.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see you've tried quite a bit of troubleshooting steps here, which definitely helps rule out some possibilities.
