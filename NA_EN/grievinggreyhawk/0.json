Hacked or whatnot, my password to my account was changed. Hence, I cant log into my account through this site or the game itself. Also, it seems the email linked to my account may have also been changed, so my password requests are not being sent to me. \r\n\r\nSo. I need someone who can actually do something about it. I dont have too much information that would go with my account other than some personal info and I have a debit card linked to the account via the actual game screen. I already assume I should disable my card, but thats personal information they have nonetheless. \r\n\r\nI have this 2nd account for the reason of actually getting into the Community since the robotic responses are literally useless since when I request a human, it asks me to log in. But I dont have valid log in info for my original account. \r\n\r\nSo again. a Human Riot Support or Representative would be helpful. \r\n\r\n-Flare{{item:3751}}","replies":[{"poster":"Streaking Flare","date":"2017-07-26T06:58:12.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive finally got access to this account again but I cant change the email its connected to without that connected emails permission!!!

Sudden chagnes to your account can be pretty scary, but we can help!  Make sure to fill out an [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416), and our account team can investigate your specific case and help to both recover the account as well as update info.  This form does not require logging in, and gives you access to submit an email you do have access to.  We'll see you there!","replies":[{"poster":"GrievingGreyhawk","date":"2017-07-26T03:14:31.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome. I did send an account recovery form, however. Whatever information I need to give about the account, I can give. Im not great on remembering purchase info but I know the card number used.  A majority of information I have of the account is something practically open to the public so that makes this difficult. I cant remember my first purchase or anything because that was quite a long time ago.","replies":[]}]}]}
