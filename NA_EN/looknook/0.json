Like I have no idea how to play Riven. Saw the Dawn Breaker skin was something I could unlock (btw best Riven skin) so I booted up an AI game to try her and I certainly did stuff. Not the stuff that all the Rivens when they like, one-shot me at level two or whatever, but it looked kinda like it without the damage. Both Syndra, Ashe, and Ekko I already have skins for, the first two from the random boxes (SKT and Marauder respectively). These are cool skins but I just don't need them, but I also can't bring my self to sell or reroll them, so there they sit. Taunting me. Staring at me...\n\nI don't want any of this to be a compliant I actually really like the loot box system as a free system. I see so many more skins now than I did beforehand. Before it, people only had skins if they really loved the champ, which was a cool way to show it. However, now there is actually a chance to see the many and cool skins that league has for its champions without playing against base champions all the time. I know I have around 15 skins from this system and they often encourage to try champions I don't play to check out the skins. Especially when the skins are really really cool.\n\nI just also wish I could either get a Jhin skin from these boxes or from the \"My Shop\" already. PLEASE! YOU FINALLY GAVE ME MALZ IN \"MY SHOP\" AFTER ALL THESE SHOPS, SO STOP GIVING ME RIVENS. I PLAYED HER ONCE!  /s","replies":[]}
