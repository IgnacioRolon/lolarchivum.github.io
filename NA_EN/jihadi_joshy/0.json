Do you just get more honors from your games or you honoring people, and how much would it take to get through the levels?","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-07-01T20:42:42.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently there's no way of measuring your level progress in honor, but you should slowly increase your level just by playing. A quiet but steadfast player still raises there level per game without votes. That said, getting a lot of votes for your exceptional behavior is the best way of leveling up fast! When it does, you'll see your Honor emblem bloom, and getting 1 or 2 Honor votes from your team in a game will put a flair atop your loading banner too. You don't get honor for voting others though.","replies":[{"poster":"jihadi joshy","date":"2017-07-01T21:42:27.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, thank you very much!","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-07-02T02:55:51.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course!
