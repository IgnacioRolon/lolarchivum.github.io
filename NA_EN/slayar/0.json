You can't send an email to everyone saying HEY GUYS YOUR ACCOUNT IS BANNED yet...their account are still available giving access to purchases, gameplay etc. \nWhoever does this, needs to be properly trained in how the banning process works and what steps to take in order for the users to be at least aware of what happened and not wondering...Will I get banned? \n\nI love League of Legends. And Riot employees are mostly fun to talk to and even support people are enjoyable...of course not when the hodored outsourcing guys just send constant automated messages. Automated messages are what make people furious...just contact billing when that happens. Almost all issues get resolved right away by the billing department.\n\nRiot Message on the Email: You're using a 3rd party software you're getting banned. \"Which is not accurate of course, because people complaining here probably never used a 3rd party software they just purchased or obtained the account\"\n\nWhat really is happening here: You purchased an account and now you're getting sanctioned for it but we'll tell you it's a 3rd party software as an automated message because we better do shit fast and ban everyone at the same time instead of going on a case by case basis even if your account is profitable for us and you spent thousands of dollars already on your smurf because of course money is not a factor for us, which is good I guess, everyone needs to be treated equally in a free to play game.\n\nIf me or anyone purchased an account and this is the way they're \"fighting 3rd party account purchases\" then if they feel a ban needs to be done so be it but do it right. And of course chargebacks will come their way from several users, due to spending money on an account and having it taken away, Paypal is a terror for companies sometimes. \n\nWhat should really mitigate 3rd party website account purchases: Riot provides the ability to buy level 30 accounts to users with an already level 30 account that have been in the game for a while. But of course that will never happen because of all the EXP boosts and that is how those remain relevant.  \n\nThe reason I pretty much stopped playing and even spending truckloads amounts of money is pretty simple, their current Scrum master, team lead or Lead GM is trying to get shit done faster even if it includes accidentally banning several legit users as a counter effect. \n\nShiz gets done, but just I feel it's not getting done the right way. Everyone was better in Season 2...the feels... \n\nThat email they sent should have said: Stop purchasing crap for our game outside our store!\n\nWitch Hunt Log:\nSkins Removed People can't purchase limited skins anymore - Witch Hunt Crusade Complete, no one purchasing skins outside our Skin Mall anymore.\nRefer a System Witch Hunt Crusade - Complete, everyone got their stuff removed, and given also an automated message similar like this.\n3rd Party Purchases Witch Hunt Crusade - Complete, everyone got their accounts banned \"or well not yet I guess\"\n\nThe real source of the issue is not yet mitigated, however people affected will now possibly never buy shit from outside their game ever again.
