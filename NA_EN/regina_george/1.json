Welcome to the world of everywhere. Where people poll a certain demographic or do test groups for products you use daily such as a car you ride in, the computer you are typing on and so on....you think they go to every single person that has a driver's license and asks them to do a test drive? No that is dumb. \n\nThe forums are in a similar vain as we are the group that is VOCAL about anything, that doesn't mean the rest of the community doesn't care but if Riot just threw stuff out and no one said anything they'd probably think no one cared at all more than simply being content. Also the forums aren't the only place people \"QQ\" about this type of stuff, the same comments are made on facebook, and Twitter, and Reddit, and rarely by the same people in those different locations.","replies":[{"poster":"Daughter of Nox","date":"2015-01-10T20:04:47.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"The key word in what you said is *'a'*. It *can* be used to represent a demographic. More specifically, a demographic of boards users. Theoretically, you could forcibly decide it is representative of the entire community's opinion, but it would be an erroneous and flawed system. Especially when you consider that a simple in-game poll could be much more effective, accessible, and easy.\n\nIt is very similar to the way in which only a minority of U.S. citizens actually vote--whether in a county, state, or federal election/proposition of anything. The decisions made in those elections/propositions are decisions that the rest of the population will have to live by and accept as a part of their daily life. Does the rest of the population have the option to vote? Yes. Should they vote? Yes. I am simply saying that we should acknowledge that there are many other players out there who don't use the boards or go on rants on Facebook/Twitter/Reddit. I am saying that these unseen and unheard people may or may not have the same opinion as the more vocal individuals.\n\nAlso, examples like test groups and polls don't work on the internet, where much of the difficulties of the physical world can be bypassed so easily. (See my earlier proposition of an in-game poll.) Test groups are flawed as well, however, there are valid reasons that companies don't reach out to entire human population to test their products. It is simply the next best thing. Test groups and polls are the closest companies can get to a representative opinion, and it *still* has a high degree of scientific error.\n\nCan we refrain from name-calling?

If you don't like the name, then don't buy it. QQ threads like these will most likely discourage them from even sharing upcoming skin info until its 100% certain, and I for one enjoy the fact that riot shares their plans before release. It gives us all something to look forward to. Let's be honest here, if they had released it with the name challenger ahri instead of dauntless no one would even be complaining in the first place, just be happy the skin just had the name changed; they could have scrapped the whole idea if they wanted to.\n\nLike the other, you just aren't getting it. The reasons in the other threads explain why it goes beyond just a simple name change. It creates newcomer confusion, encourages toxicity, and detracts from the purpose of the skin series, etc. Riot wants this to be an important celebration for a new season starting going forward, so they also want the name to be more than just name. The community recognizes this is an important skin series too and we just want them to get it right. People love the skin, love the splash, and want to buy it, but the name is a large detractor for the reasons the community has brought up. \n\nRiot also needs to listen to these supposed \"QQ\" threads, especially when 2 of them are already** over 100 up votes and hot topics**. These are people willing to spend their money on this skin. Riot stands to lose their best potential revenue opportunity if they do not listen to this community, essentially their loyal paying customers. It's bad business to ignore the complaints of your consumers if a large majority is voicing the same issue.","replies":[{"poster":"MasterOfTheOrder","date":"2015-01-10T07:12:40.217+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HuskerWolf82,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=kNhGhZyR,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2015-01-09T22:24:17.353+0000)\n>\n> Like the other, you just aren't getting it.

Makes you sound like a hipster or douche imo. \n\nAnyways, I think we both \"get it\", but just don't agree with your reasoning. Seems like a lot of you are insinuating that its more than just a name.
