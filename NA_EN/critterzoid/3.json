Also should i keep the persons summoner name in the log or erase it?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-01T02:42:12.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The first ticket category from the dropdown menu should work just fine.

I've normally never had this issue, so if there is something i am doing wrong please let me know, i can give you a step by step process of what i am doing to get this specific result, if that will help to better understand my current situation. \n\nI do thank you for your time and patience in dealing with me and this current issue. I am trying my best, as I do want to make League of Legends a lot less toxic.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-05T21:42:36.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, I've never heard or seen of this before.

Unfortunately since i do not have Gyazo pro, the information cannot be covered up but i will not put in my summoner name, so hopefully that will be a good coverup.\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/8e9e1f76e2ef03a316fa540621b09dbf\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/f9b26ff9e69308467d1bcbbf5748446e\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/9dd79da8769df71197cd3f21eab74224\n\nThese are the screen shots I have taken, hopefully they provide all the information necessary.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-08T23:12:40.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you try another category (below language) other than **Feedback**?
