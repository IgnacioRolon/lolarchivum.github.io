Though if i do go though this i have to ask, do i move the folders that is in the *C: drive* first? Or move the files within the Roaming portion of my computer? Seeing as most of my issues originate with the client, since it's well really *really* slow on my computer, even if i am in low specs. Since all i really want is for the client to run faster so that way i don't dodge so many games when the client decides to lag out on me.\n\nThanks for your answer and recommendation to use the Hextech Repair tool Broporo!

So i figured it'd would pass, sadly it didn't and crashed in a game and wouldn't give me the reconnect screen. So i am transferring it back over to my computer once more. I have no idea why the client constantly kept crashing at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-01T01:50:25.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aw heck. Worth a try eh?

It did have to download a few extra files, but other then that, sadly the speed of the client was still the same. I did try the reinstall and clean uninstall, but nothing happened weirdly enough, despite the fact i told it where the league of legends exe was.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CritterZoid","date":"2017-06-30T20:12:01.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=su01xUaN,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-06-30T20:07:49.212+0000)\n>\n> C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\ is the folder you&#x27;re going to want to concentrate on if you take that route.

I will move the folder, and then update you on the progress, hopefully all goes smoothly xD. I also understand not being sure about needing to move the roaming portion, but i will take your word for it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
