I am still waiting on it nearly 7 days later, i am wondering where it is. As it says on the promo page that the icons are available till the 9th of January of this year, and it's already the 15th of January. So where is the icon?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-17T04:54:21.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're actually sending Snowdown icons out until the end of the month, so there's a bit of time left before it gets to you.
