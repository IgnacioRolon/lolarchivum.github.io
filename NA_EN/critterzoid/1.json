I think i remember getting Riot Kayle from Hextech a while ago, but if you gave it to me (and i did not receive a notification) please do let me know. Since i would like to actually know if i received one or the other (seeing as i only got a popup for the Poro icon, but nothing in terms of the skin, or the mystery skin). \r\n\r\nIs there anyway i can tell if i got ether the mystery skin, or Riot Kayle from you Riot?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-30T20:43:23.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're aiming to wrap up distributing gifts today, but the day is not over yet!
