I get an error message on the league client stating the account is \"transferring\" and I can't even login to post a support ticket because when I try to login on the website I get an error message stating \"this combination of username password and region doesn't match.\" I did forgot password and forgot username, and the email is still my email so I didn't get hacked. Please help, I have no idea what is going on. This came after a support ticket I sent in regarding the account, I don't know if that has anything to do with it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-15T16:40:58.007+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've edited out your username for privacy reasons.  Don't worry, we can help!  As you mentioned with the ticket you sent, a security lock was applied on the account.

I had full access just yesterday and was waiting for a reply to the ticket I sent in, and this morning I cannot log in to the account on the league website or support website, though the email associated with the account is still my email, so I didn't get hacked.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-15T17:20:33.293+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's possible that the account may still not be secure then, and may need to update your information like the email being used.  I let your Specialist know the situation, but you may need to fill out an [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) in this case since logging in to see the ticket is not an option.  This form doesn't require a login.  Alternatively, you can also email us to support@riotgames.com.

No replies to either. I'm trying really hard to stay positive about this, but frankly I'm getting frustrated at how long this is taking. I just want my account back.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Melllo","date":"2017-03-17T04:23:20.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump,it's been over 24 hours since I sent in both a direct email and filled out an account recovery form.
