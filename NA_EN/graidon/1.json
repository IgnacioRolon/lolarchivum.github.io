In my last 20 games (even the wins) I have had a one case of nice in a win, lots of cases of negative even in wins (it's gg, it's gg, etc even in games we easily won), and the uneventful turned into even angry ranting usually come the lobbies and the sudden \"report x\" just because they lost a game and someone needs to take the blame in their opinion.\n\nI think in reality if you were to do the same as you suggested you might actually be the one getting the surprise sadly, which is depressing and I hope I'm wrong but from my own experiences I'm not.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2014-12-30T19:28:32.547+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sir ArmaMalum,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=4pEguEA2,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2014-12-30T19:03:20.003+0000)\n>\n> It's also a matter of human tendency.

I'm not very invested in the games I play, and I play a lot with good friends.  Instances like the one you described can suck, but sometimes it's better to just laugh it off.  I still remember some really bad experiences I had in the past that ended up just being hilarious memories for me because of the way I treated it. \n\nForever I will remember the Zed I played with who didn't understand the ult mechanic.  When I told him he had to do damage after he marked someone he said \"It's a game. Anything can happen.\"  Since that day \"It's ____.  **Anything** can happen.\" has become one of my favorite inside jokes with my friends who experienced that moment.

When studying both positive and negative behaviors, participants tend to recall more negative behaviors during a later memory test than they do positive behaviors, even after controlling for serial position effects. There is also evidence that people exhibit better recognition memory and source memory for negative information.\"\n\nThere's even citations for that quote I could add.

They're just not as in-your-face about it.\n\nThe \"small\" group of trolls seem to even turn normal community members into raging drooling lunatics sometimes.\n\nI've had games go from fine, to someone gives first blood and GG with most of our team trying to placate them saying it's alright we got this to 20 minutes in half the team is arguing, jungler is trolling, adc is intentionally feeding, and mid just afks.\n\nThis isn't an exact example so much as an exaggeration, but half the time it doesn't take much for 5 strangers (especially when most of this community is teenagers or people in their early 20s, both rather immature, not saying anything actually bad about them, just a fact of life) to have a few things go wrong and just start arguing.\n\nI've always enjoyed ranked but despise it so much at the same time. You have 5 strangers who never have and may never again talk to one another put on a team with one goal, assuming they aren't arguing when the game starts, they have to be on the same wavelength to an extent, then they are competitive trying to win and unlike normals Riot tosses all sorts of notices and updates at you when you do well or badly. \n\nSo you win, Congrats, nice green +lp and a shiny new Gold, and these borders and skins and ward skins, etc, everyone is happy. The opposite is the problem, some things go bad in the game, someone goes afk, someone rages, trolls etc, that unhappy red -lp pops up, the pop up message over your screen telling you that you were demoted or lost a series shows up, you get to see you made fun of rank (especially if you are in bronze which is like having aids in this community for some reason), you don't get the cool borders, or the cool skins, etc.  It quickly goes from happy game to competitive mess because Riot is good at rewarding but unfortunately the entire way the ranked system is laid out breeds negative all over the place.\n\nDon't forget all the in game things they toss in your face like making sure you should be excited about that triple kill, but tossing it in your face just as big when the enemy does it, even giving that sad \"aced\" when you all die. Throwing the defeat at you and making you have to click continue. Again, this community is filled with a large group of immature ages so it isn't hard to see (even though it pisses me off) why games can turn into shout fests rather quickly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ImHerVoice","date":"2014-12-31T00:43:54.312+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"thats funny because league is actually like more than 50% hostile BM now a days.\nIts a f2p Game.\n\nTheres rarely a game I end up saying a was a good game for both sides anymore.\nIts a real rarity.\nI might end up finding a gem of a player who does really well despite being on the shit team.\nBut, yet again, very rare.\n\nTheres nothing worse than meeting someone (and theres alot of these)\nthat mains one of the 5-10 broken FOTM champs because of its kit, not because they're actually good at the game mechnically (this includes warding... good decision making...

Never came back.\n\nHave to say, though, we played like beasts that game. Kept overall KDA even for most of the game, kept more pressure for most of the game, and actually had better overall damage. Just couldn't quite overcome that presence deficit.","replies":[{"poster":"Graidon","date":"2014-12-30T18:29:15.855+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I have had the rare, so very rare, successful 4v5 game but it requires a large number of factors going your way.

But that was 18 minutes of ridiculousness.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HOryShiet","date":"2014-12-30T18:18:17.534+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":23,"body":"It's not a game anymore, jackass.
