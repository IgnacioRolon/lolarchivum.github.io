I know some of it is because of my school internet downloading at 750kbps, but it has been installing for about 7 hours now. It is currently stuck on 75%. Should I wait and just see what it does or what? I have stopped and re started the installation process three times and deleted everything of LOL off my computer hoping maybe that would help.","replies":[{"poster":"bloodbathmcgrath","date":"2016-12-10T02:14:31.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you both for your responses.

If you get stuck at this point in patching again (or anywhere after 33%) then it is caused by a *poor connection* to the patching servers. In this case, I'd recommend working through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to address the most common solutions.\n\nLet me know if this caused any change.","replies":[]},{"poster":"edog","date":"2016-12-05T23:23:00.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is you're school the only place that you can download it?
