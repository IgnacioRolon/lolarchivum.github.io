Riot couldn't let that happen to their new overloaded, hyper-mobile, #LCSBigPlays monstrosity so they wrecked him.  It's the same reason all of Lee Sin's competition is getting nerfed and Zed continues to outclass the vast majority of mid laners, a number that is constantly growing.\n\nThey want to give a select number of champions the entire spotlight to work with while others are left in the dark because they're boring to watch, or crowd the limelight of their preferred stars like poor Veigar was doing.  Even if they claim that isn't the case, we've been watching, and we've been judging - it's obvious they play favorites, they just refuse to admit it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"1st HanarSpectre","date":"2015-03-07T02:02:21.526+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TotesOnSteam,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=G4PFgEHR,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-03-07T00:54:37.051+0000)\n>\n> I still don't get why they decided to render him to shit tier\n\nI don't get why people are still surprised by this, They've done it several times in the past.

So, yeah, it's true he can still be played, but that doesn't mean Riot didn't do a bad when they were supposed to buff him.\n\nBefore you consider me just another circle-jerker, I *completely agree* with the change to his stun, although when combined with the cast time, any champion can literally **walk** from the center of it and out of it before the cage comes up. Riot is fixing that next patch though, so everything about that is fine. \n\nNo, what bothers me is not the stun, but *Dark Matter.* It's basically the most unreliable skill in the game right now, since you can't stun your opponent and the skill is 98% guaranteed to miss any semi-competent enemy. The lower cooldown and mana cost is nice, but... It doesn't really help when the AoE is about the size of Syndra's Q, but has over twice the delay, *Especially* consider that **Syndra can miss her Q.** To make matters worse, Dark Matter is *literally* a third of Veigar's damage.\n\nSince day 1, that's been the only thing about Veigar's \"Buff\" I've been salty about.

He has to land his stun, and if successful has to move around the minions to be able to use his new Q as well. This is too much for an immobile champ. IMO his stun should last for 5 seconds considering how hard it is to land now, and even if you do land it you're probably not going to be able to do much aside from dropping the W.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Auryiel","date":"2015-03-07T21:06:46.989+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Timing and skill to land his stun?\n\nIt requires Veigar's OPPONENT to severely misplay to land his stun!\n\nLanding Veigar's stun is not a matter of skill anymore, it's all about making blatant and atrocious mistakes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Biffolo","date":"2015-03-07T23:40:38.698+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ProtoStorm,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=G4PFgEHR,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-03-07T12:26:45.222+0000)\n>\n> He isn't gutted.
