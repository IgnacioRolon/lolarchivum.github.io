At this point you’ll need to head over to the account update website before you can play. https://update-account.riotgames.com/","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2020-02-26T21:57:06.327+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weren't those forced to update the account supposed to recieve an e-mail?\n\nEDIT: Also oddly, I tried launching the client second time and it disappeared for me. But not for OP. Odd. I'll see tomorrow whether it'll reappear.\n\nEDIT2: So I tried the page and it claims no change to my username is required, so that's why I didn't recieve the email.
