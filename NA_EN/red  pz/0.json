While you can access other services or sites with no issues, note that each service you access online resides in a different geolocation, therefore you won't always have issues accessing all sites if you have troubles accessing one. Most of the time these issues are caused by routing issues specifically to our servers. Before we take a look at your route, I'd like you to work through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) so we can confirm your local network settings are configured properly for League.\n\nLet me know if this caused any changes for you.","replies":[]}]}
