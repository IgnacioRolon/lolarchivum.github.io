Been playing since I believe Season 3(dont remember what season honestly, all I remember was that Varus came out)\r\n\r\nNotice a trend, they can all tank to some degree.\r\n\r\nBut right now, with how Lethality is, League is a very bad experience for me, it feels like my favorite role is being invalidated completely. Being removed from the fight immediately cause a Varus is shooting more Qs than I shoot out poop(I barely eat so I barely shit) or Draven laughing as his Q-empowered auto decides it&#039;s time I take a 20s death timer cat nap.\r\n\r\nNow I understand, there could possibly be some counterplay to all this Lethality stuff, and if there is, enlighten me please, this is not rhetorical. Cause at the moment, Riot has made one of my favorite pass time games(other than Final Fantasy 14) into a slog of &quot;Who has the most Lethality based champs&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-02-19T16:45:39.261+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The counter to lethality is actually armor. The whole point of changing the name in the first place was because \"armor penetration\" was misleading, since it implied that it was a counter to armor when it's actually the other way around. \n\nAs an ADC you don't really have the luxury of buying armor before late game though, and by then the game is already set.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Divine Winds","date":"2017-02-19T04:07:55.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You're saying League is unfun... At least it isn't as 2d as Hearthstone is. Either you play meta or you won't win anywhere. Atleast you can play non meta champions in non meta lanes and still do relatively well.\n\nmore health counters lethality haHAA","replies":[{"poster":"Titty Committee","date":"2017-02-19T04:10:04.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I have yet to play Hearthstone but all I hear is that it's a boring grindfest so I avoid it.\n\n....to play League of Legends and now that I'm saying that I honestly want to drown.","replies":[{"poster":"Divine Winds","date":"2017-02-19T23:00:56.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hearthstone is straight up \"if you want to get higher than rank 10, you're going to have to throw a few hundreds our way\"\n\nBut yeah league is in a bad state rn.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2017-02-19T04:08:24.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Lethality is over tuned again.
