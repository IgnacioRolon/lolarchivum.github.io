I don't understand how I got banned for intentional feeding when it was just a bad game where I got set far behind from the start.\n\nThis is what I saw when I logged in: https://imgur.com/a/gBOuH\n\nI clicked on the game that was referenced in the message and it linked me to this game that I played a couple of days ago: https://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2685774450/89562353?tab=overview\n\nI didn't flame any of my teammates and intentionally feed at all so how did I get punished? Just want somebody to help me out if they can.\n\nhttp://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=pencilgoblin30\n\nI don't troll in my games except for one game about a week ago where my buddy and I were messing around with weird builds and I went warwick top while he went rumble jungle. We were not intentionally feeding though, just trying somthing fun late at night.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2018-01-04T18:37:19.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like Bombadil responded to your ticket in #33230225, who is a human!
