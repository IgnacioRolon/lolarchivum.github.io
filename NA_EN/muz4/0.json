I am not entirely sure if the term \"retarded\" is considered hate speech right now but that is the only thing I can see in your log that would cause you to skip tiers.\n\nYou can drop tiers by playing consistently without being positively reported.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2017-12-03T23:53:13.907+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you just came back to the game, you may have still been on a punishment tier from before you left. You only improve your account standing through active play, so if you got a 25-game chat restriction, left for a year, and came back for a couple weeks, you've really only played for a couple weeks since your chat restriction.\n\nAnyway, the punishment system is 10-game restriction -> 25-game restriction -> 14-day ban -> Permanent ban, with escalation straight to 14-day or perma in the event of hate speech, calls for real-world violence, or other excessive toxicity. Nothing you've shown here would trigger that, so I assume you just had a previous mark on your record and hit the next tier of punishment off of it.","replies":[{"poster":"Muz4","date":"2017-12-03T23:58:02.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm, i have like 1000 games in this season, i played them at the start, and then stopped, from what i remember i didnt get chat restriciton this season.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hammermancer","date":"2017-12-03T23:52:35.939+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uhh\n\ndon't say shit to people and you wont get banned\n\nit takes forever to get your first mark, but then they fucking mark your account bro, sorry, you can't be toxic anymore :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pandemic Punch","date":"2017-12-04T00:00:02.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like how Riot's system thinks I am as bad as you with no history of toxicity. \n{{sticker:sg-shisa}}","replies":[{"poster":"Muz4","date":"2017-12-04T00:01:07.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you mean? :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lucasman","date":"2017-12-03T23:51:50.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"u deserve to be banned for at least 2 weeks if this isnt a first offence\nu so toxic","replies":[{"poster":"Muz4","date":"2017-12-03T23:56:15.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well, i recently came back to game and i just want to know how the punishment system works, so i wont get perma banned, im not toxic overall, it was just few bad days/games, i remember that when i was playing before it was harder to get any ban, i got one ban at season 2, and i am playing since season 1/preseason of season 1.
