{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2018-08-23T04:11:57.211+0000","title":"General discussion of knock-ups VS Stuns","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Gameplay+","up_votes":26,"down_votes":0,"body":"There&#039;s a general complaint out there that displacements are becoming too prevalent. Many (if not most) are used to move an opponent, and those are justified (Ignoring brittle). But in terms of knock-ups specifically, I tend to agree with the sentiment. Not because of Yasuo synergy or counter-build invalidation (though those are a factor). Displacements in general are the second strongest form of CC (below Stasis), but knock-ups are functionally identical to stuns.\nIt seems that Riot is gradually trying to phase out stuns in favor of displacements. This has been brought up enough times now that I&#039;m sure most are tired of hearing it. All the same, I would like to take advantage of the Nunu rework to again ask for thoughts.\n\nJust looking at Nunu&#039;s rework, he has a knock-up on W that I don&#039;t understand the justification for. Nunu rolls up a massive snowball then pushes it forwards, knocking up what ever enemies it collides with. I see three ways to evaluate this.\n\n1. **Mechanically** - Is there an ability limitation that necessitates absolute compliance?\nHooks are a primary example of this since changing the duration one way or another would distort the readability (or at worst, function). Neither W, nor anything in Nunu&#039;s kit has such a limitation.\n2. **Game play** - Is there something in the kit or general play-style that could be broken by non-compliance?\nYasuo&#039;s Ultimate is an example of this. Since he functions off any appropriate CC, giving him access to the more common (and often longer) stun would drastically increase his ult availability. Janna&#039;s Q is another *potential* example of this. As her entire game plan revolves primarily around peeling and general safety, it makes sense that she be able to mitigate anti-peel options.\nIn Nunu&#039;s case, you could make an argument for setting up his ult. However, I would counter with the fact that he has 2 slows and a root out-side his W that are meant to help with exactly that.\n3. **Thematically** - Is there something in the theme or general perception that justifies absolute compliance?\nMalphite&#039;s ultimate, Unstoppable, is the perfect example of this. The moment he presses R, it&#039;s going off and there&#039;s nothing you can do about it. Both he and the resulting CC are &quot;unstoppable.&quot; Another example would be Vi&#039;s ultimate, as breaking the suppression-like extended animation would be incredibly immersion breaking. A third *potential* example would be Nautilus&#039; Ult, which literally shoots a water geyser up from underneath the victim.\nIf we look at the the mechanics of a giant snowball rolling on the ground, it&#039;s not going to lift anybody up. If we make the argument that compliance is justified by being buried, I would point out that the animation is more akin to an explosion (of ice, interestingly) than a collapse. So that doesn&#039;t work either. And the animation ends almost immediately, so Vi logic also fails.\n\nPlease don&#039;t mistake this for an anti-displacement circle-jerk thread. I&#039;m not against the mechanic in general. Stuns and Knock-ups are the only two mechanics with identical use cases (Suppression effects the caster). I just want to understand why Riot&#039;s designers choose one form of CC over another nearly identical one when they do (this goes both ways). \n\n--------------------\n\n**Potential Discussion Points (Topic is not limited to these):**\n - Pros VS cons of displacement replacing Stuns.\n - What champions (if any) have displacements that are hard to justify?\n - - Can we (the community) reasonably justify retaining and/or replacing it?\n - What champions (if any) have stuns that could be justified as a displacement?\n - - Pros and cons of the change.\n - Current and desired role of Tenacity in regards to Stuns and Displacements.\n - If Stuns are not sufficiently visually clear, how can we make them so?\n\n**General disclaimer / request to posters:**\nIf you&#039;re only going to claim that Riot hates stuns/tenacity and/or loves Yasuo, don&#039;t bother posting (unless you&#039;re a red post and this is the actual reason). I want this to be a legitimate discussion that doesn&#039;t scare away rioters. (I would even invite mods to remove any offenders.)\n\n**tl;dr:**\nWhy are knock-ups used instead of stuns when they are (and technically vice-versa)?\nUsed Nunu as an example.\nWhat stuns and/or knock-ups that exist in the game should be replaced and why?","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-08-23T11:55:59.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Approved!","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-08-23T12:03:26.033+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":">Stuns and Knock-ups are the only two mechanics with identical use cases\n\nThis is not *entirely* true. It's important to note that the forced movement portion is unaffected by Tenacity and cannot be cleansed. As such, a knock-up is *slightly* stronger than a stun. In effect, a stationary knock-up is a two-part ability -- one part that says \"you can't issue move commands\" and one part that says \"you are stunned.\" Tenacity affects the latter, but not the former.\n\nSo we see stationary knock-ups on a lot of characters who benefit from keeping enemies in a single position (Alistar, Galio, Ivern, Janna, Jarvan IV, Malphite, Nami, Nautilus, Ornn, Wukong, Zac, Zyra), either because they're peelers or because they have damage that can follow it up especially well.\n\nWe also see it for short-duration things, because in many cases it's more appreciable for short-term effects than a stun, because it's easier to *recognize*. Kayne, Blitzcrank, Rakan, Rek'Sai, Xin Zhao are good examples of champions that gain a lot of clarity (and some cool visual feel) by their knock-ups.\n\nI'd guess Nunu's case is a combination of his desire to keep enemies close as much as possible *and* the heavy visual graphic of the snowball. Making it knock up enemies means that the impact is a little more apparent to the Nunu players, the victims, and both teams, as otherwise the exploding snowball could graphically dominant the view.","replies":[{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2018-08-23T22:59:57.716+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Couldn't Kayne, Blitzcrank, Rakan, Rek'Sai and Xin Zhao just use a suspension then?

The only practical differences are the investment to escape (Cleanse/tenacity VS Cleanse+blink) and Visuals (Which I'll address in a moment). If movement was the only concern, they could use a root instead. What this tells me, is that Knock-ups are a CC designed for when it is absolutely necessary that the victim not escape. But that doesn't appear to be how it is used. In your examples, Zyra can make sense because she has to keep opponents in range of her plants (but no in range to kill them). On Ivern and Zac, it only acts as disruption and is somewhat spammable to boot. Wukong as a fairly large AoE and move speed boost that persists even when he is CC'ed. These three don't scream \"Compliance necessary\" to me.\n\nAs for visuals: Riot added the CC icons to champions specifically to improve clarity. I can concede that knock-ups are being used for better clarity. But if a knock-up is only used for that reason, then the sensible conclusion is that their clarity improvement is failing. So accepting that dynamic, I offer this new point of discussion:\nIf Stuns are not sufficiently visually clear, how can we make them so?","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-08-23T18:05:38.355+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ariel the Cruel,realm=NA,application-id=ELUpwER8,discussion-id=2MKjsKEj,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-08-23T17:30:57.085+0000)The only practical differences are the investment to escape (Cleanse/tenacity VS Cleanse+blink) and Visuals...\n\nI would call that a meaningful difference though.

Zac benefits hugely from additional time near a target and the ability to prep his ult. Wukong's is almost certainly a clarity issue given the thematic effect and the large particle on the spinning monkey.\n\n> If Stuns are not sufficiently visually clear, how can we make them so?\n\nI'm not sure that's the problem, so much that for some CC (especially visually complex CC or CC with large elements) it's simply clearer to see something *move*. Most stuns are sufficiently clear, but this is not the case in every situation. There is also the point of player satisfaction to consider -- knock-ups are visceral and fun and exciting, and that means stripping them out would come at a meaningful price to gameplay feel.\n\nFinally, there is also opponent clarity to keep in mind -- seeing yourself pop up is actually often a better indicator that you can't act than a particle effect, especially since stuns often have different visuals. So, to some extent, the question of \"which do I use here\" can often come down to \"which will feel more FUN here,\" assuming you have the power budget to consider both.","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2018-08-23T21:11:52.481+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Djinn,realm=NA,application-id=ELUpwER8,discussion-id=2MKjsKEj,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2018-08-23T18:05:38.355+0000)\n>\n> I would call that a meaningful difference though. If your target does not have a dash or blink handy, all the tenacity or CC reduction in the world won&#x27;t help them.\n\nWhat does that have to do with visual clarity of action lock-out? Whether you are stunned or displaced, you still can't do anything unless the CC is removed. Unless you're saying it's important to know when you are stunned VS displaced. In which case I agree, knowing *what* you are affected by, especially when there are multiple similar effects, is vitally important. However, ability to tell them apart isn't necessarily relevant to the discussion of *why* you fall under either of them in the first place.\n\n> Which would then be removed via cleanse or reduced via tenacity.\n\nSo then I fall back to a rather common question of mine. Does the existence of Tenacity as a counter create a problem in the game dynamic that would be better if removed?\n\nBy the reasoning that a Displacement must be used to prevent movement because a root could be reduced, then an unreducable root would be a healthier mechanic because it still leaves the victim the ability to peruse non-movement option.\n\n> Ivern&#x27;s goal is very much about helping his team close, and movement prevention helps with this greatly. Zac benefits hugely from additional time near a target and the ability to prep his ult. Wukong&#x27;s is almost certainly a clarity issue given the thematic effect and the large particle on the spinning monkey.\n\nI agree movement prevention helps ivern's goal. But it's not uncommon for his ult to get multiple AoE knock-ups off in a fight, or none at all. In the case of the prior, he's still causing a lot of disruption. In the latter, it doesn't matter what he has.\n\nZac's ult has a minimum charge time of 1 second before he even *starts* building travel range, full charge requires 2.5 second. His longest CC is a 1 second knock-up on a fully charged Sling Shot (shorter duration for less charge). Outside a gank or flank, that knock-up isn't doing much for his ult. Unless I'm doing something horribly wrong when I play him. . .\n\nWukong goes back to the clarity discussion.\n\n> I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s the problem, so much that for some CC (especially visually complex CC or CC with large elements) it&#x27;s simply clearer to see something *move*.

But it's also a highly subject to opinion. so I'll just take your word for it.\n\n>Finally, there is also opponent clarity to keep in mind -- seeing yourself pop up is actually often a better indicator that you can't act than a particle effect, especially since stuns often have different visuals. \n\nThat comes back to making something stronger only because the weaker version isna't as clear. If some abilities are being buffed *only* for that reason, then shouldn't clarity of the weaker ability be addressed?\n\n-----------------------------\n------------------------------\n-------------------------------\n\nI may make another topic to explore soft counters (Tenacity, Grevious wounds, etc). Seems like something worth exploring.\n\nAnd apologies if I seem obstinate in my responses. I'm trying to argue against everyone, regardless of where they stand.

Thematic\nSometimes a knockup/knockback just **feels** correct thematically and it would betray player expectations to not make it so.  Displacements are the easiest examples here (Lee Sin R) , but also things like Vi ult (where she literally uppercuts you into the air).  In these cases using a stun (where the target didn't move) would likely feel WRONG.  Imagine hitting someone with a giant water geyser and NOT seeing them move.\n\n2. Guaranteed Power\nKnockups give us a strong design tool.  They are CC with essentially no \"counterplay\" as they cannot be reduced or cleansed.  If you NEED an effect to \"just work\" and screw over THAT CHAMP for X seconds NO MATTER WHAT then a knockup is for you.  Malphite ult is a great example of this principal.  Unstoppable Force is intended to be an incredibly powerful and fight altering ability. The knockup helps it achieve that, even when the enemy is running things like cleanse and QSS.\n\n3. Satisfaction\nSometimes we just want a spell to feel good.  Knockups feel better than stuns because the impact is more visceral (you move the target OMG). Things that look flashier often feel better to hit. \n\n4. Mobility Counters (EDIT:forgot to put this in original post)\nBecause they stop dashes, knockups are a great way to give your champion a counter to an opponent's mobility tools (Volibear Roar).\n\n\nMy personal opinion is that reasons 1 and 2 are GOOD REASONS for using knockups, while reason 3 is fine but DANGEROUS.  I call 3 dangerous because in the search of \"good feels\" we can often forget about the importance of cleanses and tenacity in our game. Doing it every once in a while is fine, but if it becomes a trend where most spells have \"knockups for the feels\" the whole stun/tenacity/knockup/cleanse system can start to break down.  I'd be lying to say that League hasn't experienced a good deal of \"knockup\" creep over the years.\n\nIn regards to stun satisfaction, there are ways to have our cake and eat it too.  Knockups that fade into longer stuns are one way (did you know that Nautilus R is reducible by tenacity?  The knockup only lasts .5 seconds, the majority of the CC is actually a stun!).  Another way is the Thresh and Nami Q approach.  Both of those spells are stuns!  They just \"look\" like knockups, but can be reduced and cleansed like normal.  The cost of that approach is clarity.  They work for Yasuo R but can also be Gangplank W'd?  A tad confusing, but probably worth it in the long run to get the desired counterplay.\n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"CloudedLogic","date":"2018-09-04T03:29:58.223+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fact that you are asking about the Naut ult thing kind of makes me feel like it needs more clarity, as no I did not know about it.\n\nNothing really seemed to indicate it would work that way as far as I am aware either.\n\nIMO cleanses and tenacity already feel really weak, I always feel like merc treads are a waste of time because a lot of the cc it should reduce it just doesn't (Knock ups being one thing, but constantly reapplying cc like Soraka W, or anything with grounding on it are another).

The satisfaction bit is complete bullox since satisfaction comes out of being able to kill a champion from the CC and not seeing a champ go into the air. No one gives a shit if the champ is knocked into the air or held on the ground as long as they can be killed. The only satisfaction being derived from knockups or displacements is if that results in a champion being killed and since tenacity doesn't affect those CCs they are more likely to result in death.\n\nMobility counters is a double edged sword since mobility can also counter displacement spells.
