{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2017-01-11T00:00:17.870+0000","title":"Patch 7.1 Translated","subforum":"Memes & Games","up_votes":153,"down_votes":9,"body":"Hello Yasuos and Rivens, welcome to ~~Game Theory~~ Patch Note Translations!\nWhere I do all the work of deciphering the latest patch notes to reveal the what&#039;s really going on at Riot.\n\n. . . Or I just make shit up and fail at being funny. You decide.\n\n-----------------------\n---------------\n------\n-------\n------\n\n\nGreeting summoners,\n\nWelcome to patch 7.1, where we end our official vacation and throw out what ever the newest intern got done so we can recover from the hangovers and figure out what is happening in our game. It should go without saying, the next few patches should be a bit more focused as we get back into the swing of pretending to work.\n\nNow lets see here. . .\nNerfs.\nNerfs.\nNerfs.\nSo far so good.\nMarksman buffs. Always a good idea.\nClient updates.\nNew skins.\n\nYa, looks good at a skim. Push it through!\n\n------------------------------\n-----------\n\n***CHAMPIONS***\n\n~~~\n\n**Anivia**\n\nHer ult expansion time was being a little weird. Should be fixed.\nIf not, we added a visual indicator so you can&#039;t blame us anyways.\n\n**Camille**\n\nNew champion is killing everybody. That&#039;s always a good sign. Apparently there are some complaints about her being too strong.\nPeople like killing more than they dislike being killed, so we&#039;re going to nerf her defenses and see if that fixes things.\n\nThere&#039;s also something about nerfing her true damage?\nHold up, let me remove that real quick.\n\n**Draven**\n\nDraven isn&#039;t awesome often enough. So we made him more awesome. Pretty straight forward.\n\n**Kalista**\n\nFollowing our traditional balance philosophy that difficulty for newbies can be compensated by buffing for experts, Kalista no longer stops stacking spears and rend is effectively manaless.\n\nYes, we nerfed the mana thing because it was oppressive. But that was before we realized new players were having trouble with it.\n\nThis all makes perfect sense. Don&#039;t question it.\n\n**Karma**\nSo it turns out Karma&#039;s non-Q spells are working a little too well. So we reduced the ticks on her tether and the durability of her empowered shields.\nThe tether reduction will of course mean that she gets one less passive proc. But that&#039;s what Q is for anyways. USE IT MORE!\n\n**Kennen**\n\nNow that people have stopped complaining about Kennen, we can safely nerf him.\nExcept that we actually like him crashing into teams and stun-locking them to death. So to satisfy both parties, we&#039;re back-loading the damage on his ult. He&#039;ll have less burst, higher damage overall, and you still won&#039;t be able to stop it.\n\n**Lee Sin**\nHm? A little early to buff Lee Sin, but that&#039;s fine. We&#039;re dealing with interns after all.\n\n. . .\n\n***OH SHI+! ABORT ABORT ABORT! DON&#039;T SEND OUT THE PATCH!***\n. . .\nWhat do you mean it&#039;s too late?\n. . .\nWe make the game, can&#039;t we just undo it?\n. . .\nReally? It&#039;s that bad?\n. . .\nF+ck.\n\nSo um. . . Ya. . . The intern may *may* have *accidentally* hit a strand of spaghetti code that affects Lee Sin. Don&#039;t worry, we&#039;ll buff him back up once we figure out what happened. Until then, just be aware that tempest isn&#039;t breaking stealth and his ult has a little less base damage.\n\n**Lucian**\n\nAfter the flat armor pen upgrades, Lucian has become a little less . . . &quot;Lethal.&quot; So we&#039;re giving him some extra damage to compensate.\n\n**Poppy**\n\nSo it turns out that killing things and being unkillable is a somewhat problematic combination. We couldn&#039;t decide on which one we wanted poppy to be better at, so we&#039;re just going to nerf them both.\nEasy.\n\n**Ryze**\n\nIt seems a local blue man group representative is rising through the ranks rather quickly. We don&#039;t want to stop him, we like drinking the tears, but too much speed and it just becomes complaints. So we&#039;re nerfing his shield and Move seed steroid. He&#039;ll still 100-0 you, but now we can claim you were given a chance to escape your fate.\n\n**Shyvana**\n\nThe buffs to lizard lady&#039;s ultimate has pushed her a bit further than we anticipated. To compensate, we&#039;re going to nerf her jungle clears - where she doesn&#039;t normally use ult.\n\n**Syndra**\n\nSo..... Syndra 1-shots people. Pretty easily. Probably shouldn&#039;t be doing that.\nWe&#039;re increasing the amount of prep work to perfectly 100-0 people, but giving her some bonus true damage in return. Because unfortunately, she still has trouble killing tanks.\n\n**Talon**\n\nAssassin dude has a harder time killing people now, so we&#039;re giving him some extra lane sustain to compensate.\nWe want to see more of his awesome flips around the rift.\n\n**Elementalist Lux**\n\nApparently people have a hard time distinguishing between her abilities. Not like users overpaid for a glorified chroma or anything, but fine. We&#039;ll reduce the pay-to-win elements.\n\n-------------------\n\n***ITEMS***\n\n~~~\n\n**ZZ&#039;Rot Portal**\n\nSo Zz&#039;Rot&#039;s fire-and-forget nature was a little too overbearing. So we&#039;re reducing it&#039;s independence.\nThese changes will also make it more effective at building monster waves, so you may want to be careful where you put it.\n\n----------------\n\n***SUMMONER&#039;S RIFT***\n\n~~~\n\n**Jungle Fruit**\n\nWe made a few quality of life changes to jungle plants. Mostly by not putting Kha&#039;Zix into combat.\nWe also made it easier to troll allied Malzahars and Rengars with blast comes. No more immunity for you!\n\n**Jungle experience**\n\nEarly game junglers are leveling a little *too* fast. We&#039;re fine with the first clear lead, less so with following clears. So we&#039;re nerfing total experience when fresh out the gate. We also moved some experience off Krugs into Raptors. Now hurry up and die to the chickens!\n\n-------------\n\n***TWISTED TREELINE***\n\nSo.... We&#039;re just going to come out and admit it. We don&#039;t care about Twisted Treeline. It&#039;s too much work to even pretend to care. \nIf something on a champion is made non-existent while on a different map, we&#039;ll address that. But otherwise, our official policy will be: if it&#039;s balanced on SR, it&#039;s balanced everywhere else.\nYou can stop complaining about Illaoi now.\n\n-----------\n\n***League Client Update***\n\nWe made a lot of performance changes to improve low spec mode. Try it! Every problem you don&#039;t have there is one more we can ignore in the main client.\n\nWe also made some other client fixes that may or may not have affected peoples&#039; ability to play games. (&gt;_&gt;)\n\n-------\n\n***QUEUE HEALTH***\n\nHere it is. Queues are healthy. We&#039;re happy with them. Everything is great. We&#039;re even giving you a great big checkmark to prove it.\nThis will be the answer to all further complaints about queues.\n\n----------\n\n***OTHER BUG FIXES***\n\n- Player generated terrain is no longer disables Kha&#039;Zix&#039;s isolation passive.\n- Something about LeBroke cooldowns resetting (**Editer&#039;s note:** I&#039;m genuinly confused on this one.)\n- Shaco boxes and re-stealth when revealed.\n- Bard Q was playing a little slow-and-loose with the laws of time.\n- Fizz R no longer ignores spell shields. (&gt;_&gt;)\n- Darius&#039; free will when apprehending targets was removed.\n- Hecarim stopped critting structures. That&#039;s Jhin&#039;s job.\n- Duskblade revealing non-existent traps in fountain on respawn. . . Sorry Teemo.\n- Karma Tether color no longer vomits.\n- Camille ult invisible borders. Sorry, Trump.\n- Malphite Chroma un-neudering\n- We found River Spirit Nami&#039;s missing tail fin! Don&#039;t ask where it was, you don&#039;t want to know. . .\n- Koi Nami ordered some really expensive gluten-free wheat protein water. Divas.\n- No more persistent forest fires on Galaxy Shyvana&#039;s fire-balls. Environmental compliance act and all that jazz.\n- Fire Lux no longer tears the bottom off her dress.\n- Star lux was re-educated on the use of boomerangs. Thank you, Gnar.\n- Lightning Zed&#039;s shadow no longer becomes a real boy when dancing.\n- Ivern&#039;s flowers aren&#039;t an illusion. They were just hiding.\n- Santa Braum&#039;s poro finally got that plastic surgery it so desperately ~~wanted~~ needed. Thank you to all the children that donated!\n\n-------------\n\n***UPCOMMING SKINS***\n\nA space man has invaded feudal china. Will the Bird brain alliance be able to stop him? Will Garen get a new catch phrase? Can Vi go 10 minutes without breaking something? And just how do space pirates time travel anyways?\nFind out next time, ~~on Dragon ball Z~~ when we find the lore team.\n\nOh, and firecracker Jinx is pink now.

Her damage is pretty well telegraphed and the only &quot;zoning&quot; potential she has is from ult burst.\n> She&#x27;s always been a burst mage.\n\nI hesitate to agree with you here. For, even without her ultimate up she can still zone people off their own tower by risking an almost full lane wide stun skill-shot. (Right? She can still three ball stun yes?) That definitely helps her with zoning. However, she's much less reliant on a team to follow up on her stun if her ult is up. So with ult up, she's perhaps the best zoning champion in the game besides Ori, and with it down, she can still zone champions out but is much more reliant on team follow up to actually kill them. \nI agree she's a burst mage, and usually they compliment such burst with a short range risk. However, her ranges are a tad too high(?) for her to be balanced imo. \nYou can play her as a poke champion after ults down, because her q w e range is insane in the membrane. \nI think her damage would be fine with the risk of a shorter range. However, this isn't the case at all.  \nAs for the telegraphed q and w( excluding her e because it's a straight lane/s out from her, which is kinda hard to miss with tbh.), I agree. This is why I think her damage is fine, as long as she has a bit less range on her abilities. For, her q cd is really, really short, meaning she can afford to miss quite a bit with it and still be fine, as long as she's building some mana items. \nAlso, doesn't a burst mage have to have some zoning potential besides their ult? They are meant to counter assassins, and cc+higher range helps with doing that. However, I don't think it's ok for a champion to have all that's in her kit, plus her ranges, plus a high range garen/chogath damage ult. \nI will say this though, they would have to be really careful when messing with her ranges, because she's hella fun to play as she is. I mean, ya just feel so safe ya know?","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2017-01-12T17:59:01.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's as much a zone control mage as {{champion:63}}. The only advantage she has over him in that respect is ensuring you not lined up with her Q-E stun. And even her ult is telegraphed to an extent. She needs to prep her balls to maximize the damage. That's what this patch was primarily about. Refreshing 3 spheres with W made the perfect ult really easy to achieve, now she'll have to work harder which also gives the opponent more time to respond. (Do not confuse this with me saying she's perfect - the ult is still an 700 range undodgable nuke.)\n\nCompare her zoning to Oriana and Azir. Their units create areas the opponent cant go for extended periods, and their ults force opponents to go there anyways. Or Anivia (The premiere zone control mage) who drops a nuke on the ground and just lets it sit there for 3 years, while she walls off an alternate route to her and stuns a third.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
