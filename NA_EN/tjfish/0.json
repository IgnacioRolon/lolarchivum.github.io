Not sure if this a sentiment felt by the rest of the community, but I feel it could help avoid getting tilted by being forced to play an entire game with the prospect of losing several dozen LP for 1-2 measly LP. It does not feel very rewarding, and is quite anti-climatic when this happens, and again is completely unnecessary.\r\n\r\nOne caveat; The opposite could be said for having 1-2 LP remaining after a loss, potentially saving you from demotion in the event you lose your next game (particularly when on a losing streak). I appreciate this functionality of the game, as it&#039;s can be very stressful sitting on the cusp of a demotion and having this saving grace.\r\n\r\nNot sure what the right approach or balance is here - should we be allowed to have the former in addition to the latter? Or is that asking too much?\r\n\r\nInput is appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Honeydew Zekling","date":"2018-10-16T15:41:18.766+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure about giving \"free\" LP to get you to that sweet sweet 100.

If you lose, that 25LP can be added to your LP so you don't have to win ~2 games to get back into promos. Hell, if it's enough, why not just be put directly back into another promos?

So lets say for an example you were Gold 3 your elo i believe is like 1200 at the point? I could be wrong but the number is irrelevent. To get to Gold 2 you'd have to gain elo to get to said part is specified amount is given to get to said point. We will make this easy and say From Gold 3 to 2 is 100 elo so when your at 99 lp you haven't gained enough elo to climb into the next tier.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HommeGoujon","date":"2018-10-16T13:46:50.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, When you get promoted you start at 0 LP but when you get demoted you go back to 75 LP.
