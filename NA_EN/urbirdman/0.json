Another obvious reason is that abilities with multiple-waves of damages can no longer trigger &quot;Electrocute&quot; (the old thunderlord): for example, Garen&#039;s E. With the old thunderlord, although Garen is short-ranged and has no gap closer, but can do fetal damage once land his QE on a enemy. But now, Garen can no longer trigger &quot;Electrocute&quot; with QE, and this funny champion became useless (even with tank build, because he has 0 CC).\r\n\r\nAfter playing 50 ARAM games with the new runes system, I can confidently tell the results after seeing two team&#039;s champions. This mode became so boring because everything depends on the champions, not skills and play.\r\n\r\nARAM has never been a balanced game, however, it definitely became much more imbalanced after launching the new runes system. I really wish Riot could make some efforts to change that.","replies":[{"poster":"General Ramses","date":"2017-11-27T21:22:30.441+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree with your opinion. i am an aram player with +2000 aram games in this game mode. the game has gotten worse / imbalanced after the new runes system was applied. Summoners Rift doesnt have the exact same problem since most players will just pick something that works with the runes. but in aram people have no choice. The game is a lot more luck / champion based. One of the things i liked about the old aram was that you could go tank and be somewhat useful or if you had any \"know how\" about the builds and how to counter people you could still be useful. \n\nnow it is more or less just a slaughter. and by slaughter i mean it acquire less to no  skilll to win with ap long ranged champions. you just shoot your skillshots in the right direction. \n\nThe fun for aram for me was to try a champion i had no clue how to play and than choice some runes and pick some masteries and make some build while game was going on and see if it worked. \n\nmy personal favorite was garen with mercury boots + thornmail + spirit visage + adaptive helm + black clever + titanic hydra. armor ~60 magic resist 27. \n\nAlso aram punishes people who buy all champions and reward people with a small but effective champion pool. So for example me who have all champion will be punished for it and get more losses just because i care to play or buy all the champion.\n \ni made a similar post about this but i think the new rune system definitely makes aram less enjoyable and more boring, because you are doomed to hide behind towers if the matchup is imbalanced. its just not fun. you cant learn anything.","replies":[]},{"poster":"No5t3r","date":"2018-01-23T14:27:18.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ARAM is not about luck, i played around 6000= games and it depends on skills big time. the only problem with it is that only a few people take it seriously (its just aram). they could make a competitive mode for it.

But now, I do instant reroll when I get Garen because the new runes system only allows him to be a funny useless tank with 0 cc ability and no gap closer. So pathetic...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CPU Lyrica","date":"2017-11-15T10:01:04.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"you complain about balance in aram, where the very essence of it is people getting random champions.  meaning say 3/5 of the enemies could get their mains, and your team gets people who've never played gragas/etc.","replies":[]}]}
