I was banned the day of or the day after (can&#039;t remember exactly) for &quot;intentional feeding in a game&quot;.\r\n\r\nThis game was on Twisted Treeline Ranked because I was going for Gold Rank in it for the Orianna Chroma.\r\n\r\nIn this game I played Ekko and in the entire game I went 0-3. Can&#039;t remember the exact KDA but I know for sure I was 0-3. I had a Miss Fortune who went like 0-9 the first 10 minutes of the game. For those who do play Twisted Treeline, it is very hard to make a comeback when you are behind as it is not like Summoner&#039;s Rift.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I decided it was in my best interest, my team&#039;s, and the enemy team. Also the enemy team was questioning why we didn&#039;t ff or just open.\r\n\r\nBut I did open, I let the enemy team push and they were fine with that. But my teammates didn&#039;t like that and reported me and yet I got reported for it. I feel as if I get treated unfairly and the system just saw me get reported and just banned me cause it could. I really want my season 8 rewards as I achieved Gold in all ranked queues and caused I got banned, I don&#039;t get anything.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me please.","replies":[{"poster":"Silent Gravity","date":"2018-12-16T05:21:41.092+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Opening a lane to hasten your team's loss is a gameplay infraction. The reform card calls all forms of trolling \"Int feeding\", but that is just a label.\n\nA 14 day punishment is correct for opening a lane.\n\nIf you want to forfeit, use the /ff vote.

Hard to tell when exactly the ban was received, though. The end of the season was November 12th, and the last game the OP played before they received the ban was on November 12th. Clearly, it was either just before or just after the end of the season.","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-12-16T07:28:46.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OP, damn I dont see that term around her.\n\nIf I'm correct, I got my rewards Nov 12 12.00.\nso OP should have received the reward and then got a ban.\nare honor rewards stripped from banned B O Is?","replies":[{"poster":"Vreivai","date":"2018-12-16T07:33:45.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not everyone received the ranked rewards immediately upon the end of the season. I remember seeing at least several threads from people who didn't receive them and thought there was a mistake, but received them within a few days of the end of the season.\n\nAnd as far as I can tell, no, bans do not strip ranked rewards. Players that received a ban simply have not been given the opportunity to get their honor back to level 2 before Feb. 11th like those who were only chat restricted were.","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-12-16T07:35:10.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well shit I guess I am wrong.\n\nThanks for the notes atleast.\nwell oof OP.\nhey, OP get borders in the middle the season next year!

You should still receive season rewards if that were the case.
