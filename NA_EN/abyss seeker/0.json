(Camille Support)","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First, sorry for the many spelling mistake, english isn&#039;t my first langage.\r\n\r\nOne thing I like as a support main is to play off meta support, and, when Camille was release, I was in heaven. When I saw her kit, I imediatly say to myself that it would be a great support. She have a passive shield, a slow that heal her and poke intensely, an AOE stun that is at the same time a huge engage and escape potential and her ult that can save your adc or make so other can&#039;t go away. We can add she is a support that even if you are building almost no dommage, you will still be able to do enough to 1v1 a lot of people if there is the need.\r\n\r\nSo, I began to play her in blind norm, and I&#039;ve been surprise with how good she was in support position, leveling myself to mastery 7 in no time. The build that I find that work well would be this. {{item:2302}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3025}} {{item:3022}} {{item:3026}} {{item:3083}}  (If people think about something interesting I can change, I would be interested to hear it)\r\n\r\nThe problem is, I alway get flame by people before the game begin. At the begining it was okay, but, it got worst recently, to the point where people just disconnect from the champion select, or, in draft people who ban her so I can&#039;t play her. It just continue to go worst and worst. Should I stop playing her support because of the other, since Camille do not have support in her class? What can I do to make that stop? Or, will I have to just live with it and continue to play a champ I love in my favorite position?","replies":[{"poster":"Truly Prideful","date":"2017-01-07T21:25:46.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can see it, her kit definitely has the tools for it.  I would 100% take Relic Shield over coin on her, it's just better and gives you both sustain. I would personally take Titanic Hydra over Mallet, it has nice synergy with her second Q hit and all of the hp you're building there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2017-01-07T21:25:46.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've actually used her as a Support. It worked out pretty well but of course it all depends on who your ADC is and/or the people you are playing with. I tend to play most off meta supports when I'm playing with friends so it works out better cause we have the synergy to make them work, however if it's a random person I dunno, then it can be a bit difficult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2017-01-07T21:20:02.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when you off meta support in draft never show pick intent if they cant deal with it they will just have to dc. people dont ever want to explore what can be done in the game they dont want a fighter support because (no utility) but they never use the utility of tank supports and they want the fighter to do the same thing as if they were top lane all the while ignoreing that they arent getting farm and are takeing less kills but still have good damage to input into the fight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-01-07T20:14:53.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why play a melee support with ancient coin instead of relic shield? I'd prefer to have redemption there too and Warmog is a bit pointless on her. Her health scalings are on her shield and heal, and Redemption's bonus already boosts those with the added utility. I'm not sure she needs the gauntlet AND mallet either, or even any of those at all for that matter since she already has a slow on her w. I don't see any powerspikes on that build either and it has next to no AD.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2017-01-07T20:31:35.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"There are very very few champions who have nothing going for them in terms of support viability, and even those few who who don't (i.e. they have no utility whatsoever) could be considered snowball kill lanes.\n\nThat doesn't mean that you should play most champs support. As you move up in ELO, you'll find you want the utlity offered by more conventional supports outweighs the limited utility provided by less conventional supports. That said, if you're really good at a champ, you can make it work in almost any role pretty much up to diamond. Again, it isn't necessarily a good idea, but you 'can'.\n\nI haven't even played camille yet, much less camille support. That build seems rather expensive on a support budget though, and I'd probably want stuff like redemption or locket. I don't like the idea of mixing mallet with guantlet, as it seems to overlap a fair bit.","replies":[]}]}
