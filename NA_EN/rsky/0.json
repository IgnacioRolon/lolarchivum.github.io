I played the game well even scored an S. The midlane and botlane were all premade and they felt the need to be very toxic and team up on me and report for no valid reason. I feel very upset and I think its unfair that toxic players can team up to get somebody banned. Its very unfair that those players are going around ruining games for others.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-29T01:48:49.333+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This account wasn't banned for anything like picking Morgana jungle in a normal match.
