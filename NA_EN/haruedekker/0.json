The apartment I live in is kind of... well, bad xD If I have too many things in the house running at once it'll blow the fuse box. This had happened multiple times during norms, but this happened during a ranked match... My placement matches... Oh dammit...\r\n\r\nThen to make it worse, my wifi doesn't come back on right away cause I have no idea why! All i saw was red lights and i was freaking out and by the time I get it to work, it's 25 minutes in and my Nexus is under siege. Now I'm upset about losing the game, alright? But to make it worse the guys all report me for leaving... and I couldn't convince them that I was telling the truth cause well, they're kind of stupid and don't want to believe me.\r\n\r\nNow, can Riot tell the difference between someone who left, or someone who was unable to come back? Cause I reeeaaaally don't wanna get banned :(","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-26T15:32:53.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you had a series of unfortunate events.  :(  [Leaverbuster ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ)will actually treat all leaves equally, regardless of intent or trying to come back.  Even if it's out of your control, all leaves still cause others a negative experience.  It definitely sucks coming back to a game moments before losing, but that's just as disappointing to everyone else who participated in that match too. \n\nIt's best to find options to prevent further interruptions from your games.  While I can't really offer help with a fuse box, we can try to troubleshoot any connection issues.
