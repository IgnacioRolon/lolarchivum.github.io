I personally experience this issue from time to time as well, and I believe it started after we made a broad update to the Community Beta on January 31st.  I suspect that this is occurring due to old cookies/cache for the League of Legends website.  To that end, I strongly recommend that you clear your cookies/cache for your web browser for League of Legends.  If you need help in completing this step, make sure that you check the following link:\n\nhttps://riotgames.zendesk.com/entries/21947484-Clearing-Browser-History-and-Cookies\n\nLet me know if you are still experiencing the \"SEE MORE\" issue when you view a community!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blunts4Brekfast","date":"2014-02-04T06:26:35.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And how do I get people to see my threads?
