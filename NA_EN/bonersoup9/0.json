I'm having login issues; I can't even submit a 'request' on the support site.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dear Riot Support,\r\n\r\nI have been a fervent League of Legends player for the past two years of my life. It's been the only game I've played for the past 2 years. I'm not the best but it's my favorite game and my go-to game for letting off steam after a long day at work or school. \r\n\r\nHowever, I was a upset when I discovered I couldn't login the other day. The issue it says is I am 'unable connect the login queue'. It seems to not be authorizing my account. I have undertaken numerous tasks to mitigate the problem myself. At first, I tried Hextech Repair Tool. After running the suggested functions it came back that it couldn't sync the clocks unless I ran the app as an admin.  Even after running through as a admin, I couldn't log in. I tried the 'clean uninstall' function. But when that didn't work, I manually uninstalled and reinstalled LoL. I booted it up and  I STILL couldn't log in. \r\n\r\nAfter feeling like I tried everything I could, I tried to submit a ticket request to Riot Games Support, but when I tried to login on the website it says \"An error occurred while attempting to validate your authentication, please try again later\". I was able to login my account online through other means and change my password and validate my account, but when I try to go back to the support page and submit a ticket request, it prompts me to login again and gives me the same error message when I do. I am extremely frustrated at this point. I can't even get in contact with Riot Support! This is ridiculous at this point as I have spend around 5 hours to troubleshoot the issue and I have gotten nowhere! \r\n\r\nI am unsatisfied in the lack of my ability to get in reach with Riot Support. I have spent numerous hours and hundreds of dollars on this game and I feel hopeless on resolving the issue. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKevin","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-22T17:09:11.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It must be unsettling having this sudden issue after playing so long, and it sucks!  It sounds like something is blocking you from reaching our services in and outside of game.  Since you're not able to reach the ticketing center, grab those HRT logs and send an email instead via support@riotgames.com.  We'll reply back as soon as we can!","replies":[{"poster":"SkyGlider","date":"2017-07-23T14:32:35.859+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also am having the same problem","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ravenwolf01","date":"2017-07-24T00:54:32.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am also getting this issue.

The issue for me is when I try to login to the support side the \"login\" link just links back to the support main page so there is not even an opportunity to reply. Very poor support setup.","replies":[]}]}
