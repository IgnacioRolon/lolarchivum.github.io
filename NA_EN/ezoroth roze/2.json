It didn't, so I realized it was a legit crash and closed it, tried reconnecting, but it didn't work. I closed out of the client, tried to join as fast as I can, got to 99%, and bam. Game is over. Counts as a loss, I am salty.\n\nThat is all.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-01T22:17:34.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn, that really sucks that this happened during your Silver promos.  =/\n\nDo you get a specific error message when your game crashes, or any specific behavior you can describe? This will give me the context I need to provide you with the right steps to take.","replies":[{"poster":"Ezoroth Roze","date":"2016-09-02T02:46:56.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, yeah, I get a few different errors every now and then. I got through my Silver promos, barely, so I'm not as salty as I was at the time. A lot of the time, it'll just stop responding and it'll give me the usual window that gives me the option to either wait and see if it's responding, or to kill the program. If I wait, 8/10 it'll just automatically start responding. But those 2 times that it doesn't, I usually can't reconnect fast enough for the remake because I have to close out of the client and re-open it, usually having to terminate it in task manager. \n\nSometimes, it'll give me an error message along the lines of \"Sorry, the game crashed. We'll be closing now.\" and other times it'll give me an error message saying this (it's not my link nor my picture, but I don't have a picture reference myself), [\"You have disconnected. Please check your internet connection and try again.\"](http://i.imgur.com/ePmUdHPg.jpg)\n\nIn this case, it just stopped responding and I had to do the client termination. If there's any information that you'll need please ask.\n\nSorry that it took so long to reply, I had stayed up all night trying to get into silver, so when it was over I legitimately couldn't have passed out any faster.\n\nOn a side note, if you don't mind I ask, how long have you been a red? Do you enjoy it? Who's your favorite champion? :D","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-04T15:48:29.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based on the information you've just provided, I believe this may be the result of fluctuations in your connection to the server.
