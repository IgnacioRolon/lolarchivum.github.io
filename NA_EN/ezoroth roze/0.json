Today, approximately 7:20-7:30, Ezoroth Roze attempted to play some League of Legends. As he was attempting to join the game, he noticed it was taking a while to appropriately display the loading screen, and clicked only to find out that it wasn't responding, and have it crash on him immediately. After multiple failed responses, he took a screen shot and closed out of the client in order to reopen and hope that he can make it in time.\n\n[Picture Number 1](http://imgur.com/a/AUYIf)\n\nTo his dismay, he found the client was taking a while to load, and when it eventually did, it was on the home screen! He was outraged that he lost his S4 Promo, but shrugged it off and decided he'll just have to get back into it and move on. Unfortunately for him, it was only going to get worse. He queue'd up for another game and everything was ready. The game started, and he waited patiently. The loading screen opened, but his computer wasn't showing it. He frantically clicked on the League window button on his taskbar, hoping that it'd open, but alas, it refused to be displayed. He closed out of the program and opened the client using the hidden icons bar, where the client minimizes itself while the game is being played, and found that for some reason, it considered the game still open.\n\n[Picture Number 2](http://imgur.com/a/3628H)\n\nConfused, he closed out of the client and reopened it. Once the client restarted and he had managed to get back in, he happily noticed the game was still going, and immediately attempted to reconnect, only to find that he was just too late, and as the loading screen opened, the game ended. This is when he found that he was now unable to earn loot \"due to leaving or AFK behaviors.\"\n\n[Picture Number 3](http://imgur.com/a/Aj7PN)\n\nNow, he has lost his promos, a second match, and his ability to gain rewards for doing well all due to being unable to connect to the game. He is sad and miserable, and probably going to drown himself in eggs to try and make up for it. What a horrible day.\n\nLong story short, game wouldn't connect and I was penalized. Don't know whether I should just give up playing until I upgrade my PC or figure out what the problem could be so that I don't get further penalized or just keep playing and hope things don't go south anymore. Last time this happened I kind of had it sorted out, so I don't know what the problem is this time. It's not giving me the same messages, it's just crashing out of the loading screen. It's been happening a lot more frequently, especially since the new patch, but it'd happen occasionally before, too. It's not BugSplat (haven't seen that for a while) and it's not the internet connection, so I feel that it's either a mixture of League and my computer, or it's one or the other.\n\nWell, guess that wasn't long story short.\n\nEDIT: Post fixed. I also can't remove the link, apparently. Whatever, just ignore the top link.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-26T15:14:03.974+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to help you out so your story can continue after this climax!  In general, it sounds like you're having more of a network problem than a PC one.  Unless there's something wrong with your physical network card, you should be able to troubelshoot this.  Specifically, I recommend going over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to tune up your connection.\n\nIf you're having any other error messages or crashes, let me know what's going on exactly and when if it's not a bugsplat.  I'm happy to help!","replies":[{"poster":"Ezoroth Roze","date":"2016-10-28T14:15:16.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, everything seems to be working now? I haven't changed anything since my previous post... It's weird, but I'll take it. Kind of wondering about the Hextech Crafting penalty. Anything I can do about that?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ezoroth Roze","date":"2016-10-27T05:42:12.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, so I went through the steps again, but this time I also used the Hextech Repair Tool to see if that'll help. I'm trying out a normal game right now, and will edit with my results. On a side note, is there anything that can be done about the penalties I've received? I don't really care about the losses that much, I'll just make it up and win some more games, but I do kind of care about the Hextech crafting.\n\nI didn't finish my message before getting through champ select, so I can confirm right now it's not letting me join. I closed out of my client as quickly as possible and reopened it, rushing in as fast as possible, and I'm actually in loading screen now.\n\nJust loaded in right after typing that. Maybe I just need to restart the client each time, but I'd like to know what you think about the situation and if you know anything that could help. As far as I could tell, it just crashed with a not responding window, and then almost did it again. I've noticed that I can't start loading into the game until it starts, too.\n\nSide-note: Thanks for assisting me! I have a few silly questions I like to ask, just out of curiosity. You don't have to bother with this if you don't want to. I was wondering how long you've been a red, and if you enjoy doing what you do in general. And who is your favorite champion?","replies":[]}]}]}
