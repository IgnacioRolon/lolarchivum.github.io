sheen procs exceptionally potent on him, since triforce sheen proc deals twice the champions base ad value in damage.\n\nthe burst he gets out of the sheen procs added to his q against squishy champions makes triforce a situationally very good item on him.\n\nthe same way, the double hit passive from {{item:3124}} is so broken on {{champion:67}} with her w, that the loss of gold for ap on the item doesnt even matter.","replies":[{"poster":"DespairSlayer","date":"2019-06-12T09:52:05.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aha.. thank you for the
