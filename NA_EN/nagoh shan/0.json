Back when the changes to the shield happened I said he was going to drop out of favor and not see much play. Turn out I was correct and he is down to 1.73% Played in lane and .44% played in jungle. (Numbers from Champion.gg)\r\n\r\nSo much power was lost from his kit incrementally that even when tanks where super in, there were just better options. And with the coming changes to tank itemization cost and stats, Sion&#039;s going to have a harder time than ever. I don&#039;t even think he&#039;s gaining armor like other tanks to compensate for the itemization changes. \r\n\r\nOne thing I would recommend it to return power incrementally until he gets to a good point, by reverting some of the changes. The E nerfs to damage and mana cost dramatically hurt his lane game, but his W nerfs pretty much took him out of the game. Three seconds over two made it just too difficult to activate in a teamfight, and made it just long enough that jungle camps could pop it in early levels so you didn&#039;t get the extra damage on your first clear.\r\n\r\nI wouldn&#039;t try to be creative and come up with some new way in which you can improve him. Just return power that was lost in previous nerfs. He was over nerfed, instead of trying to add random buffs to compensate, just pull back on the nerfs until you get to the sweetspot you missed previously. Go to his patch history and go from the top down. W nerf -&gt; E damage nerf -&gt; Q damage vs JG nerf -&gt; Q/E mana changes (This was a power shift that hurt his lane phase) Run through that until he gets to a good point again. If power creep was too much, then come up with small things to help him, but that&#039;s unlikely to be needed.\r\n\r\nAlso, I feel the level 1 cheese has always been something that riot has tried to compensate for rather than just get rid of it. I&#039;d personally say just get rid of it. It&#039;s a strategy that trades too much of his kit&#039;s power budget for the sake of a level 1 advantage that detracts heavily from the play experience and ability of the lane opponent to respond. \r\n\r\nI say it possesses much of his power budget, as I don&#039;t feel changes to the E and W would have been needed if Sion wasn&#039;t making it to the first wave at level 2 with a starting item, boots, and full pots, while then throwing E&#039;s and W&#039;s around like he was the Oprah of ass-whoopin.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scruffy","date":"2015-08-16T21:25:46.634+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personal opinions INC but here's my 2c:\n\n* Numerically he seems balanced, reasonable win rates on our data and all of the external sites like OP.GG etc\n* As most sion players (myself included) prefer top sion over jungle, there may be room for a slight power shift towards top sion rather than jungle\n* The W 2->3s delay nerf was warranted in terms of power, but the feels hit was probably not ideal.

Jungle Sion is already on the lower end of winrate and play rate.\n\nI actually prefer jungle Sion because he feels less cheesy. Lane Sion mostly wins by shouting at you repeatedly until you hit 40%, then ulting when your mobility spells and flash are on cooldown.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scruffy","date":"2015-08-16T23:59:25.774+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not at all what I mean.

I know you did it once before, but it may help.\n\nOr, make it so that if his E hits a minion, it does physical instead of magic damage? So people will go Armor pen instead of Hybrid pen in runes, and his W will in turn do less damage?\n\nSion, to me, seems like a perfect fit in he Juggernaut role. It's even in his title. I would say a nerf on E, with the delay on W removed and a few buffs too his passive (Death Surge removes slows, and it and his health decay reset on kill or assist) would make him viable again.\n\nOnly other thing I would do is maybe a small increase to base AS, to help last hitting and promote building Ravenous/Titanic Hydra and other Juggernaut items.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pretty Dhizi","date":"2015-08-16T22:34:09.358+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sion's amazing in his current state.

He really doesn't deserve any more hits...\n\nPersonally I find Sion most fun on 3s as a more AD-bruiser with Q max. Top lane there if you max Q you can charge it unseen in the brush in that small lane and zone/force em to contest brush/fake em out :^) ... And if Sion dies on 3s his zombie is a menace. Decent dmg/good cc/good engage. Much funner than playing him full tank on 5s.","replies":[]}]}
