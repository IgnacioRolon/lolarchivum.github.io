Usually lands around 45, not only that but after my recent games it greys out the play button and will not allow me to play or join invites. I've tried waiting it out, repatching / repairing my client and everything but it still has the same problem. Restarted my router twice already with still no result. Happened out of nowhere, was wondering if maybe anyone else was having similar problems or any possible way to fix it?\r\nClient already high focus status on windows 8 for ping fix, also I ipconfig /flushdns sometimes when it gets bad which is usually in the day but at nights I NEVER have this problem. Problem currently started a few hours ago while everyone was off the internet. Any advice would be helpful, thanks!\r\n(As I've written this play button is still grayed out.. tried playing a ranked game after waiting 15 minutes for it to come back and the ping was an issue, they remade, gonna put off playing till somethings done / i can fix it)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-16T03:45:14.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We most often see these sorts of issues with latency (ping) when there are issues on the local network and on the path to the servers.
