His post about the bug below:\r\n\r\n&ldquo;So friendly champions can attack GP&rsquo;s barrels. It won&rsquo;t set them off though. Due to this, a GP can put a barrel in a safe spot for a friendly Draven to stack his passive by continuously catching axes.

But then again, it could be something in the coding for the barrels rather than Draven's axes, in which case it would make more sense to disable GP.","replies":[{"poster":"Sachabot","date":"2015-07-30T18:50:02.207+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why would they disable Draven?

It's more punishing people who just like playing GP rather then punishing the people who are intentionally abusing the bug. You do make a fair point about risking other bugs if you try to fix that while leaving him up, but I just don't think it looks very good on Riot's part if Bilgewater's main champ is disabled during the Bilgewater event. I have to give Riot credit though, they made it fit nicely with the lore's timing.","replies":[{"poster":"Wind Whistler","date":"2015-07-30T20:02:07.966+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HaugheyPuck99,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AWLTXpZ2,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-07-30T19:18:28.667+0000)\n>\n> Because to me that seems like the type of thing you'd have to intentionally do with Draven.

Riot says its just because he died in the story but they could just be saying that for a number of reasons. Like maybe they don't want to look bad about having messed up on the coding for the only ability they changed on his kit (aside from his ult but those were minor changes in comparison), or they could just be messing with us. Maybe they were joking when they said its not because of a bug and they thought people could tell they were kidding. \n\nEither way, hopefully they'll re-enable him soon. My guess is they'll do it at the same time they release the next act of the story.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rubber Jesus","date":"2015-07-31T05:49:31.553+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Draven is disabled, aren't you punishing people for playing Draven when they weren't abusing the bug, as well?\n\nJust saying, reverse logic.\n\nAlso, this allows them to test more interactions with the Barrel. Can Annie stack spells on it in a bush, only to pop out with a Tibbers+stun?  The enemy won't be expecting it since they assume she has nothing to stack it on, and a literal Q Barrel + W + E  + Q Barrel would be a fast buildup without the enemy thinking it could be done. Does this mean we disable Draven and Annie, if that's the case? Or can Yasuo prep his Q with it? If so, should they disable him too? \n\nThey would most likely disable GP, and then test interactions with each champion that has the ability to do this kind of thing, while altering the code to make a fix. Disabling Draven does nothing to stop any of the above. It only hurts Draven players who were not exploiting it, and makes them wonder why they can't play Draven due to a bug that isn't in his code and only shows he is working as intended.","replies":[{"poster":"HaugheyPuck99","date":"2015-08-01T00:29:44.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I guess I can't really argue with that.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-07-30T22:20:09.521+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm betting the reason they chose GP over Draven is that act 3 came out at a convenient time for them to pull a \"GP is DEAD!\" publicity stunt with a well timed disable, and then they just bluff it off that he was always gonna be disabled.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2015-07-31T00:22:09.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"there was a bug where kench could literally team kill, it still might be live, and he hasn't been disabled","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-07-31T00:28:16.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's probably rare enough that they felt comfortable leaving it for a patch cycle or two instead of disabling and hot-fixing the patch.\n\nThis bug that they're saying GP had is very easy to do and also extremely easy to exploit (simply stack free gold on Draven and profit—literally), which is probably why they chose to disable him.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
