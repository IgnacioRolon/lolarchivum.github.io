Assassins should be able to overcome mages and AD carries with gapclosers and burst damage, but they should not have escapes, that allow them to take no repercussions if they engage wrongly and fail to assassinate. An escape should be rewarded to assassins who succeed in assassinating, not those who fail in assassinating.\n2. AD carries should be able to kill tanks (since in late game they should be able to deal high sustained damage to tanks unless they position themselves wrongly)\n3. Tanks should be able to deal with burst damage from assassins and should be able to punish assassins if assassins engage improperly at wrong time and position.\n4. AD carries should not have (cost-free) constant dashes (Yes I am looking at you Kalista) since they already have high range and have access to life steal which costs nothing.\n5. Tanks should not be able to deal high damage and tank damage at the same time.\n6. Assassins should not have long-ranged-and-high-damage-and-low-cooldown pokes (aka Zed, Nidalee, etc). Even if they do, the pokes should deal little damage, and should be served primarily as a means to engage (like Katarina's Q debuff for example).\n7. Bruisers (like Jax, Irelia, Xin Zhao, Lee Sin, etc...) should have DPS moderately lower than that of AD carries, and should not be able to tank damage as much as tanks do. They should be basically \"a little of this, a little of that\" champions.\n8. Bruisers should be able to kill squishy carries by circumventing the CC from tanks and without invisible hidden powers like Irelia's passive.\n9. AD carries should have only one of these characteristics in each of their kits: hard CC non-ultimate regular abilities plus snares (snares are preferably healthier for AD carries), or dashes. They shouldn't have both since they are supposed to be damage dealers. They are not supposed to dish out hard CC like tanks do. A little knockback, knockup, knock-sideway is fine for AD carries with dashes, as long as these abilities do not drastically impact a fight.\n10. Assassins should not have access to hard CC, and if they do, the gateway to successfully activating hard CC should be difficult. Ekko's W is a perfect example of the \"gateway\".\n11. Mages should be able to have some abilities that allow them to counter assassins a little (aka hard CC), since many of them have no escapes. These hard CC abilities should be difficult to use (should be less difficult than that of assassins, if any) but extremely rewarding when pulled out successfully.\n12. Tanks should be most of the gateway to hard CC.\n\nThe post-nerf Cinderhulk is not perfect (since tanks dealt a lot more damage than they should), but its associated tank meta is arguably one of the most balanced metas in the history of LOL, because almost all of the above applies in the meta. Riot ruined things over by making armor less useful and making assassins and bruisers have to ability to kill tanks when they shouldn't be able to.","replies":[{"poster":"Quort","date":"2015-08-20T19:46:33.331+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"If an Assassin doesn't have an escape or poke, then they have to have massive 100-0 damage in order to be effective and that is generally not fun to play against.

I mean assassins should not be rewarded an escape if they fail to engage or assassinate. An escape should be a reward, not a \"get-out-of-jail-free\" card.\n\nI also disagree with your stance on poking. Many assassins already have massive AOE damage to obliterate squishy carr**ies** (that's plural) if they engage properly. They do not need high damage pokes to do the job. If an assassin relies on pokes to do his assassination, why don't Riot just make him a mage? A mage relies on pokes whilst an assassin relies on quick engage, gapclosing and assassinating, not pokes. I even listed one exception to this \"no pokes for assassins\" rule: if a poke ability does not do massive damage and opens the door to engaging assassination (like Katarina's Q), the \"no poke\" rule does not apply.\n\nAlso, tell this to Talon and Rengar, who have ultimates that allow them to do either one of the following only: escape/going all-in and assassinating one/more target(s), without escaping (or escaping conditionally with enemy minions nearby, using their regular non-ultimate ability/passive). Tell that to Akali, who basically either goes all-in or dies unless there are enemy minions around, too.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Spizzle9000","date":"2015-08-20T01:51:20.105+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":25,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Keevalroy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HrALzjwh,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-08-20T00:00:15.242+0000)\n>\n> They don't  care about game health, all they're  out to do is promote their flashy over-the-top bullshit playmakers so Reddit has something to beat off to.

You have more engage tools than they have disengage (bandage toss, righteous glory, malphite ult, talon flank, blitz grab) when combined with ezreals+malphites poke means you will always have good initiations to take. \n\n> We had the better teamfight because of our tanks, no other class can afford to play so mediocre and be so effective on the game like i did, don't think i had 1 successful gank all game but it didn't matter ult in fights win.\n\nRight, which means the enemy didn't punish your poor early game enough to win, and your superior mid and late game carried you through.

And what tanks are you referring to that do more damage than an assassin? Sejuani maybe, but she got nerfed into the ground pretty quickly. Maokai? Used to do damage but now nobody even buys him a RoA anymore because Righteous is so much better. I can't think of any tanks other than Sejuani that have any good damage scalings when built full tank.
