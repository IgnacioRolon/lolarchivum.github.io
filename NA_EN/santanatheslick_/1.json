Particularly because BotRK, which is her core item, is practically a rush item. And that item rushed, practically guarantees that she won't ever get chunked out in an extended trade, while it's active complements her already good chase potential. And this item, has been buffed Twice rather recently. (First time was making it's passive apply LS, Second time was the cast range on the active.) \n\nAssuming that the problem is Vayne's synergy with this item, even at early levels. (and not BotRK being OP) I would probably nerf her Early AS.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-10T07:35:14.932+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imo, BotRK rush is generally probably just too strong, especially on champions it synergizes with.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-08-10T07:38:11.148+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.

Low range marksmen who want to focus on CSing need to be poked out of lane, but Sona is too terrified of Thresh and Leona to be picked, Lulu has been nerfed and basically vanished from bot lane, Soraka lost her manaless poke, and Zyra...I don't know what happened to Zyra but she's basically been non-existent since mid S4. \n\nThere's no one to challenge Vayne. If Leona hops on Vayne, Vayne will just knock her back. Poke supports and ratio carries need to be strong to keep Vayne in check, and ratio carries need access to a good mid-game item that provides sustain. Essence Reaver and BT just aren't good enough to be rushed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Felyne2","date":"2015-08-11T10:52:06.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont play vayne but ill give you my mind.

Once you get a modicum of skill with her she goes from being a risky pick with a bad early game to one of the safest ADC picks that's hard to shut down.  Think about it:\n\n- She has 550 range, which is about average.  This means most other ADCs can't really bully her without getting shot in return.  She actually outranges most ADC lane bullies, except obviously Caitlyn.\n- Tumble makes her very safe.  Its low cooldown and cheap mana cost make it a great tool for not being hit by anything.\n- If an enemy gets close she can Condemn them away, keeping her safe from ganks.\n- Once she gets her ultimate she gains short-term Stealth, making her even harder to pin down or gank.\n\nAll this on a hypercarry duelist's kit ensures that she can stay safe early game then explode into the late game unless a disproportionate amount of attention is dumped into shutting her down.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nameless Voice","date":"2015-08-09T18:28:25.287+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Early game?\n\nLet's say you are Draven, and you are both level 3.\nDraven has 679 health.  4% of that is ~27 hp.
