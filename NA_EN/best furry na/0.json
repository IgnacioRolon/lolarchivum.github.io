I think 1900x1080.\r\n\r\nAnyways, it's been running at that 100% fine for quite a long while.\r\n\r\nSuddenly while in game, the screen went entirely black. Then I noticed my mouse was moving oddly. After game I noticed what went on-- my resolution reverted.\r\n\r\nThen my computer went on to say that higher resolutions for this monitor arent supported (they are, it's always allowed many many more options well above the 1360x780 it's at currently until now). I tried using NVidia to make a custom one but it won't allow that. I updated my driver and restarted my computer twice. Also unplugged and replugged in my monitor. \r\n\r\nI'm kinda unsure what to do.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-08T21:18:29.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might be having a driver or hardware failure, which can result in issues like a black screen with sounds.
