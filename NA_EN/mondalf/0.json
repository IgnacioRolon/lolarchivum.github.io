It would break the ladder.  :/  I'm not seeing any issues with our servers, meaning technically Leaverbuster acted accordingly by applying a loss.  If you want to toss me some more details, we could get a better idea of what exactly happened, and if it is something with our server then EU support might be able to make considerations.\n\nDownload [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and run a traceroute to the EUW server 192.64.170.252 for about five minutes.  Let me know what you find, but also be careful about queueing for another matchmade game until we're sure everything is okay.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
