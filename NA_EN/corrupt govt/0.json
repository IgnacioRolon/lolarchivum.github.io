Riot's stance has always been to remove the people who abuse features to be jerks rather than the actual features themselves. If someone can't or won't control themselves enough to not constantly take the time to type out rage filled posts in the chat then that's on them, not Riot.\n\nAlso, your analogy doesn't work in this case since the people in question often know what will happen if they negatively abuse features constantly and just don't care. Riot doesn't punish people who use features in-game, they punish those who use them to constantly create a negative environment for those around them instead.

So I reported a player but then I still lost LP in the process of playing ranked game because some players have decided to troll. Is there any mechanics or systems that can refund the LP that I have lost or \"Lost prevention\"? Hope rioters could help me out with my frustration.","replies":[{"poster":"balbraaksel","date":"2016-07-23T11:32:39.879+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're probably new or something, there isn't any compensation for trolls because Riot assumes both sides get the occasional troll.","replies":[{"poster":"welovegag","date":"2016-07-24T04:48:21.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Then maybe starting reading the damn question?

Im suggesting/questioning of what Rioters can do instead of cannot do. Id rather remake/not gaining any LP when the enemy team is feeding rather than just playing with bunch of kids. I play for displaying my skills and fair matchups not blindly rushing for Elos. I dont see any further explanation that can make u understand that lol","replies":[{"poster":"balbraaksel","date":"2016-07-25T02:21:02.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's that I completely understand what you mean, it's just not how it works and I explained to you how it works and why it works like that.\nI also want to add another reason, it's because of that such a system can be abused.\nSo it's basically Riot saying, there's a chance for trolls on your team but we won't compensate in LP for it because trolls happen on both sides.","replies":[{"poster":"welovegag","date":"2016-07-25T03:15:54.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=balbraaksel,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=dBcmRkNo,comment-id=000300000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-07-25T02:21:02.823+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s that I completely understand what you mean, it&#x27;s just not how it works and I explained to you how it works and why it works like that.\n> I also want to add another reason, it&#x27;s because of that such a system can be abused.\n> So it&#x27;s basically Riot saying, there&#x27;s a chance for trolls on your team but we won&#x27;t compensate in LP for it because trolls happen on both sides.\n\nAnd there goes the toxicity culture around this community. If this isnt going to address, the community will eventually fall off the wagon and becomes another COD kids summer fun party but who am i to judge. Perhaps they got more money from scrapping off kids/ parents money to buy boosting and skins.
