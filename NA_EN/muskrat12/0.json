The system caught it, and she was marked as someone who went AFK (post game screen where the champ icon is \"x\"ed out), and I guess I'm just curious why they don't have a relegation prevention when the game is not a \"standard\" game 4v5...etc.\r\nObviously they can't put it in when someone feeds like crazy, but if someone DC's after the remake point for long enough that their system catches it by the end of the game (surrender vote is 4...etc), why not prevent any relegation? I think it would be fine to lose LP points, but relegation off of that is frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-11T02:32:18.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Having a system like that would be a clear way for people to avoid losses. You could easily set up a premade, and when things start looking bad you could have someone bail and then nobody gets the loss.","replies":[{"poster":"Muskrat12","date":"2017-11-01T22:47:22.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean, you could make it so if a pre-made person does it, then the pre-made receives the current penalty like currently. Not to mention the AFK penalty that you guys have set up now as well.\nIt would just be more of an individualized experience.","replies":[]}]}]}
