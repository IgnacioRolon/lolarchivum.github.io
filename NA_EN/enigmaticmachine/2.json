At a 20% play rate and 53% to 54% win rate in diamond and below I think riot should nerf her ass so that lower elo players dont have to make her a permanent ban choice. Just give her the stats back a month or two before LCS so she isnt a dead pick either. In fact can you do that with a lot of champs that are blocking others from climbing. I am getting tired of banning certain champs just because of the elo I am in.","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-07-15T20:37:55.554+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mord has 53% wr boards lose their minds.\n\nAhri or an Adc sits at 53%, and no one gives a shit. \n\nClassic.","replies":[{"poster":"Rákãñ","date":"2019-07-15T21:38:04.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dunno, I see someone complaining about Ahri every time I look at the boards.","replies":[{"poster":"EnigmaticMachine","date":"2019-07-16T04:13:54.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ShiraTsuki77,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=M7x4Esn7,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-07-15T21:38:04.858+0000)\n>\n> I dunno, I see someone complaining about Ahri every time I look at the boards.\n\nLook dude they are just mad because they suck at mid which is a pretty easy and most impactful role.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EnigmaticMachine","date":"2019-07-16T04:13:00.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kelg,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=M7x4Esn7,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-07-15T20:37:55.554+0000)\n>\n> Mord has 53% wr boards lose their minds.\n> \n> Ahri or an Adc sits at 53%, and no one gives a shit. \n> \n> Classic.\n\nYou know riot is just buffing her so what is the point.","replies":[]}]}]}
