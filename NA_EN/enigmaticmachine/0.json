Now the system knows they're not the same person.\n\nThirdly, reliablity is not crucial. Reducing smurfing is still good even if Riot can't eliminate it.

Although it can be circumvented by using friends and family phone numbers, it would certainly slow down account sellers from farming as many ranked accounts unless their profit margins were enough to buy more cell phone numbers. It would also cap off how many accounts a single person could smurf seeing as the amount of numbers you can collect and smurf depend on how many friends you can make and are willing to share the number with you.\n\nBut a problem lies with the case where a player decides to switch phone numbers for various reasons. There could be number mismatching or collisions if the number you switched too was already associated with an active account.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Supa Smasha","date":"2019-09-02T03:04:34.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's no problem with it. If a player wants to prove that they didn't just get lucky to climb, fine. While it could be said that those players ruin the game for the lower ranked players that try to play with others at their skill, 1: It's one game, and 2: They don't want to be there either. They want to climb out. Now I definitely think the same person shouldn't be able to hold multiple places in a limited-players rank like Challenger, but they should still be able to rank up other accounts to prove to themselves that they are the legend they think they are.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sinister Anubis","date":"2019-09-02T03:22:47.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Personally id say yes. Its really hard to recommend a friend to come play this game knowing their is none stop smurfs and they would get flamed on for being bad, and completely dominated on. There really isn't a new player base anymore and most of my friends that did get to join played a few games then never came back due to how out classed they was and the hate they received. \n\nAlso i would like to point out most people with Alt accounts dont care about punishments received and is over looked. If a Alt got banned or perma banned i doubt anyone would care, they would just move to their main account. Thus the amount of toxic players in lower levels is extremely high!\n\nHow can riot really tackle this problem, i'm not entirerly sure except maybe putting a paywall behind it or possibly a phone number or some other restriction or verification other then an email because those can be used over and over again. I like the phone number idea just limit the number of accounts attached to it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WarnercBbT","date":"2019-09-02T02:25:37.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":9,"body":"Playing on a old account can hold you back from actually climbing.\n\nSomething should be done about people with 30-45% wr being allowed to play the game.","replies":[]}]}
