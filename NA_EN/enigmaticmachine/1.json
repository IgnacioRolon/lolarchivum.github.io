This game prioritizes damage way too much now to the point to where you see three mages with a super back line adc and a zed just ripping through anything with only one item. They need to revert the death cap buff back to 35% and void staff back to 35% and rework lethality items to make assassins actually viable and not one trick ponies. This game was much better when tanks ran the police station. I cant counter burst with zero interaction. In fact no one can. Mages out perform every other role in every class comparison. Most mages are ranged. Most mages have the most broken item utility like hourglass and veil and even the most over flooded rune set ups and cdr items. They are the most safe and highest reward champs with almost zero risk. People may complain they have no itemization, but when do you need \"itemization\" when all mages run the same broken items to become unkillable hyper dps and burst machines. Akali and rumble have taken over top along with kennen. Karthus and gragas and even brand are taking over the jungle. Supports are running rampant with mages because of how unbalanced spell thief's has become. Adcs are running the show again with the crit items being reverted back to their op state which they cried loud enough and riot was too lazy to fix it. All in all this game is too much of a coin flip. You cant win unless dmg is the prime objective. Towers are useless because of this constant champion power creeping and the good player are having to suffer. Even mages complain about mages in game because they know their class is for braindead monkeys. I can blindfold myself and get a triple with karthus just because i pressed one ability that does way too much dmg for a global ult. EVEN ZEUS IN DOTA DOESNT FUCKING NUKE LIKE KARTHUS DOES BECAUSE THEIR IS NO AP SCALING IN DOTA YOU KNOW WHY, because they know how broken mages are when it comes to peel and poke and teamfighting.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-25T00:18:19.274+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":">Akali and rumble have taken over top along with kennen.\n\nThis is something that never happened.

Also adc items are the best scaling items in the game and give the most ad. Also bruiser items have to be better because bruisers are normally melee champions with little to no ranged poke and need better items to deal with mobile champs and ranged poke. If they did not have good items then they could not exist in game. Please make sure you understand how this game works before you try and say bruisers and bruiser items are the best in the game especially when most pro players, including faker, agree that mages and mage items are the most over tuned things in the game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DGOT","date":"2020-02-21T12:24:00.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The thigh guy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wgnA9auH,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-08-25T00:32:54.453+0000)\n>\n> Maybe after we nerf bruiser items.

Less DMG, ALOT more durability, Items that makes them unignorable (when exactly did you see the last Frozen Heart? Or an Iceborn on anyone other than EZ), FAR less vulnerable to penetration. \n\nI agree Supports have to much budget in general. \n\n- Ap supports always existed and this is fine. But in earlier days they were clear feat or famine. A decent option for midlaners who had to support but not much more tha that. More often than not they needed to trade Vision for DMG. This was completely removed from the game. \n\nI agree that towers still feel quite useless.\n\n-  The DMG is to blame for that to a degree, but mobility is the core problem here. To often I've seen Champions diving towers doing their full combo and getting away with only a single tower shot fired. There is FAR to much mobility, FAR to little anti-mobility!  (Hey, why not make Randuins shockwave GROUND affected Champions for a while?)\n\n-----------------------\nThe Anti-Mage bias however is just wrong. Neither do mages take over every role nor are they uncounterable. The mana changes made their lanes super vulnerable, they have no form of sustain what so ever and MR is BY FAR the best defensive stat in the game. A single MR items makes pretty much everyone able to 1v1 a fed mage with little to no effort. \n\nMages are without a doubt they biggest and most diverse group of Champions out there. I mean you list Akali and Gragas as mages??? But even without those the class is huge. Obviously there will always be some viable ones for each role in the game. \nFunny enough.. their choice of (viable) Items is easily the WORST in the game. Yes indeed, you see the same build on every god damn AP-Scaling Champion out there - do you think people LIKE that? OFC NOT! \n\nWhat's true is we have to many mages at Supp. That's annoying. For those playing against them, for those playing with them, for those who actually enjoyed this guys in midlane! \nThey contribute alot to the DMG-Creep, they invite mobility-creep to grow.\nGames with traditional Supps in it - especially the Tank supps - feel SO MUCH BETTER to play it's hilarious.","replies":[]}]}
