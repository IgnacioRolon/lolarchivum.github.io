Anyone else have this problem?  I've tried restarting my computer to see if anything went weird on my end but i dont think so.

I dug into this and it looks like there are login issues impacting players in the West/Southwest (USA).   You may experience issues logging in or getting stuck at the authentication server.

It looks to be impacting players mostly in the west as well.  Trying to get info as it comes, it's a bit harder because it may be due to an ISP situation and not our servers.
