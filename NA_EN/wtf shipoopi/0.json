While active Elyn gain the persistent effect of all her abilities for 15 seconds and her AA range increases to 200.\n\n* * *\n\n# **Lore**\n\nAs the oldest daughter of the noble House Laurent, a family known for its long line of elite duelists, Elyn always fought for greatness. Dueling everyone who dare challenge! Beating all foes who dare cross her path she thought herself the greatest duelist. Finally choosing to challenge her father, she lost in what was a humiliating defeat! When she later found out about her fathers treachery she demanded a rematch only to have her younger sister to earn the honor first. After the fight and her fathers lose, she refused to accept that her sister was the new head of House Laurent. Taking her fathers custom weapons Elyn took to find training from true masters. Training in on Mount Targon with the Rakkor clan. Learning all they were willing to teach her, Elyn now seeks to bring House Laurent and her family's name back to the legacy it once was.\n* * *\n\n# **Strengths and Weaknesses**\n\nElyn has a very weak early game, because of this early ganks to push her out of lane are a must. She is a snowballing monster so try to never 1v1 her without a hard form of CC or huge burst damage! She can easily stay in lane or jungle for as long as she needs. Using and crowd control after she uses E means she has no escape. She is strongly countered by any anti-AD champion. \n\n* * *\n\n# **Stats**\n> HP: 547 (83+/LvL) 1958\n> Mana: 258 (30+/LvL) 768\n> AD: 57.58 (3.1+/LvL) 114.785\n> AS: 0.666 (2.95%/LvL) 1.0 (.999~)\n> Health Regen: 6.33 (0.6+/LvL) 14.6\n> Mana Regen: 7.144 (0.5+/LvL) 15.644\n> Magic res. 32.1 (+1.25/LvL) 53.4\n> Armor: 24.125 (3.15+/LvL) 77.675\n> Mov.

If anything I would suggest her passive scale based on level, rather than a flat amount. 25 extra damage at level 1 is probably too strong, and at level 18 with a full build is probably too weak. Alternatively (or in addition to) you could have both the duration and the damage stack for each ability use, meaning spamming abilities in quick succession will rapidly ramp up her damage. Also, not sure if this was intentional, but at early levels 3 attacks in 3 seconds isn't  normally possible.","replies":[{"poster":"WTF Shipoopi","date":"2015-02-24T17:02:43.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was toying with that idea and personally could not find a happy amount for it to scale with.. Kinda hoping someone else would have a good idea! \n\nAbout it not stacking I feared her stances being changed to gain a huge amount of AD. The main reason I made it unable to stack. The 5 second thing is cause I wanna give the abilities a 7second cool down. This would enable you to keep you stance and the 25AD if you build full CDR. Other wise to keep the 25ad you need to manage your passive and change stances! \n\nI was thinking along the lines of all her abilities would be a AA reset. or maybe just Q.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The pimp P0P0","date":"2015-02-25T20:57:00.885+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love the Stance idea, i feel the game needs another and this is a great way to do it, but she needs a tuneup. \ni like the cooldowns, i feel that they are at a perfect time, because she is a stance champ you dont want them to high or low and i feel 7 is a good median. Before i get into the abilities i think some stats should be said... we know she uses mana but dont know how much or how much each spell costs. So i think she should have mid to low end stats for everything (hp/mana/ad/as/ and so on) but not of all camps just the melee bruiser ones. Now her spells.....\n\n1. Q) A lot of people think that the 20% attack damage is to much, but when u think about it its not... She only gets it while in that stance and can only AA with it. The active not that bad either, it only dose 50% ad (even with the 20% increase its still less then a normal AA) \n\n2. W) The armor penetration seams high at first but if you look at all the champs that have armor pen its right there with them [(Link)](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Armor_penetration) The active is solid i think... haven't read any complaints about it, its damage is off bonus AD so it will be weak early and the slow is a good amount. If anything the damage should go down to 90% bonus AD\n\n3. E) Attack speed is good but people seem to not like how much life steal she gets... wait i mean how little she gets, yes i said little. If you look at the 5 other champs that have life steal she gets the mid point of all of them [(Link)](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Life_steal)\nThe passive is cool, it gives her a little bit of mobility and dose no damage.\n\n4. R) That CDR should not be there... If you want a passive on ult then give her something like crit (she is a master of the blade so knowing how to get a crit makes sense ) how much maybe 5/15/25%.  Onto the active, it last for 15 seconds (so as long as Rivens Ult) and it gives you the persistent effect of all her abilities (+ %AD/ %armor pen/ %AS and 15% life steal) and increases her AA range to 200. The AA range is cool but the other part of this might be to strong, not sure tho. Why because the increases while in that stance are ok because its only while in that stance but getting them all even tho they are the median of other champ that have them, those camps dont have all of them... So this might ge a good amount or it needs to be weakened.. Maybe make it a % of all the persistent effects.. but dont change the idea of it... i feel it ties her together...","replies":[{"poster":"WTF Shipoopi","date":"2015-02-26T01:00:12.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Thank you, that is basically the thought I was putting across.. Which is why I used % AD instead of flat.. I think flat would just me drowned out late game! Yes I don't think people realize that the active on the Q is not another AA it is 100% what it says! \n2. I can agree with people thinking it is high. Again I think the problem people need to realize is that the only way that is even a treat is if I build High AD/AS. Only the W gets the Armour pen! \n3. That was a huge point for me! A LOT of champions have HUGE AS boost's Along with some decent Lifesteal boost. 15% might be high but I personally think its just about right! You have to think she is also getting no benefits from other abilities again! \n4. So to clarify why I put CDR. I was not aiming for a crit machine {{champion:41}} . I thought of it like this! The longer you do something the better you get at it! The faster you can react blah blah blah.. So CDR. Also while it might seem like alot of CDR she is barley getting anything do the math.. It almost seems pointless.. The biggest thing I would fight about this is the fact its on the Ult. However placing anywhere else seems weird. SO I don't know.. I did read a comment or two I liked in the comments I might talk to my friend about!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PANBU","date":"2015-03-08T00:31:56.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow that is OP with the passives","replies":[{"poster":"The pimp P0P0","date":"2015-03-19T14:54:34.073+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"she is like Udyr, and if you look at his [Link](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Udyr) you might say the same... them being  Stance's make it not as OP as you would first think","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2015-02-24T18:49:06.898+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it would be better to change her passive to the % damage amp but have it so it stacks. What I mean is, have it so using an ability increases her damage by 10% and each successive ability use increases this by 5%. So her main combo would be to say, use E 10% increase, three autos, then switch to W, 15% damage increase, three autos, then Q, 20% damage increase, three autos, and then finish off with her ult, 25% damage increase. \n\nHave it so her full potential is only reached by fighting consistently. I'd also change her Q passive to be lifesteal while removing that from her E. This would also make her Q more obviously for the end of her combo after she's taken damage she needs to lifesteal from.\n\nHer ult needs some work I think. Having all of those passives at once is pretty op, it's just too many free stats. I think a better way would be to have it have the persistent effect of the last stance she used before ulting, remove the CDR passive, and instead have her ult give her some sort of combination of the active effects of her basic abilities. \n\nSo maybe have her ult give her auto attacks altered for the duration where right clicking an enemy will cause Alyn to dash to that target and then spin around with an aoe auto that slows enemies close to her and causes bullets to spray out.\n\nOverall though, she might still have too many free stats without enough draw backs, so I think one of two things might need to be done. One is a bit controversial but also interesting, make it so she doesn't gain AD per level. This would make her have to build damage period to make use of her free stats so she can't just build tanky and get by on just that. \n\nThe other idea is to just make it so she loses stats when she is in a different stance. So maybe have her lose attackspeed and movespeed when she uses her W for instance and maybe range and damage when she uses E and MR and Armor when she uses Q?\n\nEdit: She'll also need to be very mana hungry. Like, EXTREMELY mana hungry, as in, AD Anivia mana hungry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheFameAnimal","date":"2015-02-24T17:04:14.098+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOOOOOVE IT! :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sirsir","date":"2015-02-24T15:01:16.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OoOOooh, a stance champ, lovely!

I absolutely HATE Udyr because playing him feels one-dimensional and boring due to how lame switching his stances feels. This however seems to be making each 'stance' into an ability as well. Which is a far better way to handle it. I do think some of these numbers are a bit too high. Like the passive Armor Pen from her Saw Blade stance. Even Darius' passive E only gives him 25% armor pen. Maybe flat Penetration would be better than % for her? Dunno, 35% just seems pretty high, considering that 35% armor pen is what a Last Whisper gives you. Also, the Gun Blade passive giving you % extra AD seems really powerful, especially if she maxes it first, it makes ALL of her item purchases, runes, and masteries FAR more effective. Maybe instead of AD, give her a range increas in auto-attacks? Like Jayce switching to Hammer Form. She IS using a GUNblade after all, so when she's in that form give her increased Auto Attack range as a passive? Just a thought. Her AA range does increase in her ult form after all, so maybe just move that extra AA range from her ult, to her Gunblade passive. You might also be able to then put the 20% extra AD into her ult instead, make it into a temporary high-damage form where she does tons of extra damage with her Ultimate Blade?\n\nAs for her lore, getting to Mount Targon seems pretty hard. Maybe instead of just waltzing up there, she got heavily wounded in a battle, but the Rakkor clan saw her talent, and took her there to heal her, and train her? Might also be a good explanation of where she got her blades, since the House Laurent doesn't seem the most technical of families. Maybe the people on Mount Targon had them in their armory and she chose them as her weapons? Once again, just spitting out ideas.

I was bored at one point an looked up how Squall's blade work. At the point of contact, The trigger would be pulled increasing damage and some times breaking Defenses.\nSo It could be used as her Pursuit, Charge and Flee move that has piercing damage of 2%, 2.5%, 3%, 3.5%, then 4% for basic with a 5%-7% Piercing for active skill.\nBut Due to the recoil from each shot, her attack speed would go down by .20 - .30 at level five\n\nThe Twin Blades I would Suggest lowering her Damage by Half and dropping Life steal in favor of auto block and three hits or damage. Attack speed and be raised by up to .35 at level five after starting out with .20 For level one\nThe jumping stays as a Hi how you doing move\n\nThe Saw-blade's original set up I think works best by having it be an Arc based weapon which sacrifices speed and Defense but acts as a splash with higher damage. This would drop her Piercing damage but make her a decent minion farmer and Group fighter with another person near by. Making this most likely her starting move of choice.\nDue to momentum being a thing though with arc based attacks, If She stays in a single place constantly attacking, her attack speed can increase with each attack with up to 10 Stacks of +0.05 AS, but as soon as she moves or stops attacking the attack speed is lost.\nThe active for the move though would possibly be a single forward spin for 50 - 250 Piercing.\nUsing the active will cause her to step forward with out losing her stacks.\n\nDue to the Sheree weight of all the ultimate weapon, I would advise it be temporary for maybe 10 seconds with the ability to deactivate it sooner by pressing Q/W/E; Which when hit has a temporary double buff for the active skills only with an added cool down of 10 seconds to the other two as her swords would be 'left' on the ground. Like Gnar's boomerang, picking them up would drop the additional five seconds This Ignores the (Second) Main passive as her swords are not on her.\nThe Passive would be The Gun-blades Piercing and speed with The Saw-blades arc and Damage with every 3 hits auto block activating\n\nFor her Main Passive I would giver her something that lowers the cool down of her current stance by 2 (At 1) - 4 (18) seconds \nOr\n Granting her the ability to 'sheath' her swords once every five seconds out side of combat by pressing the Key of the equipped sword cutting her cool downs to 0. Ultima Excluded\nTo compensate for that though, her cool downs would have to be ten seconds minimal even when they are maxed out.\n\n\nGoing by what I just said, her standard abilities in one on one are decent with her Twin being the entering choice until about the five second cool down mark with her then moving to Ether the Saw-blade for tanks or Gun-blade for runners for early on\nBut in late game depending upon where and who you are dealing with it could go Twin or Gun for entrance with Ult as one on one followed by Ether Gun or Twin for the finish\n\nI hope this makes sense to you all ^^;","replies":[]},{"poster":"Embertine","date":"2015-02-25T08:15:13.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kinda cool concept.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Helzing Vxz","date":"2015-02-25T07:48:59.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome concept, 10/10 would main if she hits the rift, but her numbers must be lowered a bit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"N30NP4NDA","date":"2015-02-24T23:36:09.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So...

Damage output is high in such a short time frame. Also by reading the abilities once I would guess the combo would be something like E, W, Q, R or E, W, R, Q which is OP as fck lol. My main question is why does she have base lifesteal when she is a blade master or whatever? Also I feel like her persistent effects should be like Rengars fury stacks except on her ultimate. It would work like this, when she used her ultimate she would be able to activate only one of her persistent effects, not complicated but it would stop her from being as OP as she seems to be now. I'd also think about buffing those CD's and making them vary from each other because she could easily pop that entire combo and then in exactly 7 seconds could unleash her ENTIRE combo once again, with CDR that's kinda crazy. If she ran off mana then it would probably help to keep her under control in lane so she can't spam abilities so much. This would also add a small skill curve to using her as well because spamming would cause you to not have abilities to use by being oom. \n\nAaaaany how, I really see potential in this champion hopefully my mere constructive criticism didn't throw you off ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"The pimp P0P0","date":"2015-02-24T19:27:16.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree ultimate needs work.. but im not a fan of the Rengar thing... what if she got 50% of the effects so \n**(ACTIVE: Elyn combines her weapons creating the Ultimate Blade.
