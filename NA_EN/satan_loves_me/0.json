There hasn't been a single game so far that has gone smoothly or even been enjoyable at all. What i also want to know is why hasn't riot done anything about this yet? its been months since this started and i feel all the reports i send mean nothing and go nowhere. Also before people try to bash me saying \"create your own game blah blah blah\" that's not the point i'm making...\r\nthis game mode use to be a great way to learn with other people at a beginner level\r\nnow its ruined and you actually have to try and have decent mechanics to win a single match to carry the weight of the bots.","replies":[{"poster":"Kellvas","date":"2020-01-06T22:12:50.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So...  what sorta behavior do you get?
