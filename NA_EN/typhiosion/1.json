I came back about a day ago but my ping was randomly high in game but not on the loading screen. I looked everywhere and tried almost everything until I gave up. But before giving up I thought I would launch the legacy client to see if I got ping problems on there. Loading screen just fine, ping staying steady, in game I thought it would turn out just like all the other times I tried something and ending in disappointment, but my ping was actually steady and working properly...I was confused and really happy. I think its because I have a craptop and on the new client when you load into the game, the client stays open in another window thing. Just my thoughts, but still kinda wondering if that's the reason I was having ping problems on the new client.","replies":[{"poster":"golem kid","date":"2017-04-30T05:14:19.823+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'm getting 400 ping but it only started when the legacy client was retired \nits weird cause i would get 40-49 ping and that was on both the new and old clients before the retirement ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-30T00:41:06.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I haven't seen a case where the Beta Client itself directly affected anything latency (ping) related since the Beta Client doesn't really change anything in-game other than it taking a bit more resources to run in the background. I've seen it affect FPS or stability for low-end hardware because the client has processes that run in the background, but I've never seen it directly affect latency.\n\nAre you still experiencing this, or has the issue subsided?","replies":[{"poster":"TyphIosion","date":"2017-01-30T01:46:12.732+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, my fps is just fine but my ping gets all crazy and skyrockets.
