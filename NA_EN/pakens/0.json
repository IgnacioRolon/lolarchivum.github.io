This means that each drop reduces your chances of the next fragment dropping exponentially, and towards the end of the curve, fragment drops are **extremely rare**. This *drop rate* resets ~30 days after the first fragment drop, so you may be towards the end of this period before your drop rate resets.\n\nGive it some time and you should start seeing more key fragments. If you don't see them later down the road, let me know. ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"Pakens","date":"2016-12-06T03:30:13.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"alright ill let u know thanks for the help :)","replies":[{"poster":"YallReadyForThis","date":"2017-11-24T19:52:17.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"has it helped you ?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
