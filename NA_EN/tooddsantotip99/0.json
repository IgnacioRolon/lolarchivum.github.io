With a 1 minute shorter banning phase you will wait 13 minutes instead of 14 now - such a great improvement, isn't it? :)\n\nThe real reason - what even they told us, wrapped in excuses - that they don't want 10 bans actually. They don't want some of their hated/broken poster champs to be permabanned as they don't want to rework or balance them at all (think about the sea of Yasuo, Lee Sin, etc. one trick ponies who are all paying costumers, and this is a business and not a sport after all...).\nThe other reason - what makes a bit more sense - is that the last bans, especially the 2nd phase in the LCS format, would be aimed at certain roles, what means that you should have a reasonable champ pool to deal with 2-3 bans aimed directly at you. Again: one tricks would cry too much. But hey, in a ranked draft mode you shoud have a reasonable champ pool anyways. But if we could trade pick order - and not just already picked champs - it would help a lot (like I prefer to be the last pick, even in an LCS-like format...).

There is a business strategy by Riot, \"artifical meta rotation\".

By this, the actually viable 20-30 champs always change so you always have to buy new champs and hopefully new skins for them, etc. Business. A proper 10 ban system would require them to finally sort out a proper balance, or even worse, the community would just ban the hell out of the FoTM champs, balancing the game by themselves against Riot's business strategy.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm 100% with you that we should get the LCS system as it is (as even Riot said million times before about balance and autofill and such that one of their primary policies is that LoL has to be the very same from b5 to pro play...).

It is such a shame that the people will never get the experience they deserve. It would actually work better because from what I am witnessing in the bans selection, people are just banning champs THEY do not like. No talk, no strategy, nothing. I mean, to be honest, how much stargazing can you do in 30 seconds with the flood gates open. The engineers at Riot I am sure always scratch there heads when they do major updates like this, when they say they are listening to the forums, but then turn it into some half ass project. Why make is over complicated? Why not just make simple like the model they use for LCS? If this is how they want it then I want to see it in the pros too. I want to know what the pro teams would have to say to something as inane and asinine as something as this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrHaZeYo","date":"2017-06-01T05:56:47.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Buy how much though?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2017-06-01T14:09:35.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Indeed and they could keep the 'prefer not to ban' option, and just have it default to that when their timer runs out, instead of booting everyone and researching for the match again.","replies":[{"poster":"Aterpater","date":"2017-06-01T15:07:12.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Resulting in lost bans due to afks and trolls what will result in a long 20-30 minutes wasted on an unfair and probably terrible match...\nNo, thank you.

Sure it's possible, i would actually really enjoy it. I just know the complexity of the strategy would be lost on most low level players.\n\nThe MSI format is just for that....pro play. Coordinated bans on specific positions. They also have the advantage of KNOWING who they're playing againt. You know the champion pool of the enemy so you can fully utilize the second ban phase. In solo queue, people just ban what they don't wanna play against.\n\nThat's just my take on it.

Way I see things as long as its not one of your teams champs enemy bans can and should be ignored, and even if you lose some champs you should ideally (not be a foolish one tricker) have back up options.
