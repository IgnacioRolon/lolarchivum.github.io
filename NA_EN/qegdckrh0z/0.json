Note this is a new account and I have been told in the last two lobbies that you have to buy champs to play otherwise you can't play anything. But let me ask you this how can I buy champs on a new account without spending money on them I can't go into a match to earn IP to buy champs when I can't get into a match. So is this RIOTS new way of forcing people into spending money on game now?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-11T02:54:48.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That was indeed a bug we noticed rather quickly happening to players lower than level 10 on OCE. Thankfully I was able to notice quick enough, and we pushed out a fix that enables the normal champion rotation for everyone. \n\nHave you been able to see champions in that lobby yet?","replies":[]}]}
