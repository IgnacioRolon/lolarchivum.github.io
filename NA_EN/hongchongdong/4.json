No matter how you screw up, or how badly you play them, they always have too many mechanics that hold the hands of the players who're using them until they inevitably score those kills, sometimes the wins, and then the player can feel good about themselves. \n\nZoe is a very toxic example of this. Designed around a 1 use combo? Stupidly low cooldowns. Love to spam your abilities off cooldowns? Low mana costs and mana regen from items and runes is through the roof. Lots of skill shots? Along with the low cooldowns, she has blazing fast missile speeds and massive ranges. Missed your primary damage? As long as you hit you hit your CC then it will amplify your passive and will hit like a truck. Just out right dropped the ball? An RNG system that outright destroys and mocks the concepts of summoner spells and investing gold to actually obtain an active. Someone build MR? Free true damage build into her rotation. \n\n Did you know that with the +5% max CDR rune zoe can actually CC a champion and then have her E back up in 2.2 seconds? \n\nThere's legitimately nothing to actually exploit or look for in Zoe's kit that would give you a window of opportunity. Technically you could count on the player being bad, but that's any champion period and doesn't really work as a practical means of counterplay. \n\nShe's a no risk all reward champion. She's basically an assassin with the ability to pick someone from extreme ranges then engage for an almost guaranteed 1 shot with little to no risk to herself. \n\nI can get behind how her kit operates, I think most can. But there needs to be a shit ton more punishment for screwing up than there is now. \n\n\nSwap her E and R. Her sleepy bubble gets turned into her ult and given a full ultimate level cooldown. Then make it so she only gets the CD refund if she actually damages the target after they've been put to sleep. \n\nRemove the guaranteed return on her blink. If she gets hit with hard CC during her blink then she shouldn't beable to return.\n\nFinally, remove the ability for minions to drop her W stacks for actives and summoners. Instead make it so it drops blank bubbles that simply allow her to activate her W for free and make this effect available on every minion wave rather than RNG. That, or at the very least massively reduce the duration that bubbles stay around and then reduce the effectiveness of actives and summoners that are dropped by minions.","replies":[{"poster":"Crede777","date":"2017-12-12T20:25:20.658+0000","up_votes":81,"down_votes":16,"body":"Zoe is a \"high skill cap\" champ because her Q and E are skillshots and she is very reliant upon positioning in order to land those abilities or maximize use of her W and R in the combos.\n\nExcept Zoe excellently demonstrates why this narrative is a false one for Riot.  Maybe she is \"high skill cap\" compared to many other champions who have abilities which are easier to land or who aren't as reliant upon positioning.  Except for a couple things:\n\n1. She is a very forgiving champ due to her low CD's, mana costs, and the power that W gives her in gaining extra item actives or summoner spells (pre-6 teleport dropped by minion = free buy and lane pressure).\n\n2. She has insane pick potential similar to that of Nidalee and Blitzcrank.  You can miss 100 Q's but once you land one that's it.\n\n3. Most importantly - high skill cap is a relative term.  None of the champions are what I would define as \"difficult\" to play.  Spend a couple of games with them, learn their abilities, their strengths and weaknesses, etc.  Great, now you can play that champion decently or very well.  But since Riot thinks that champ is a high skill cap champion, you now have access to more power than you would with similar other champions.  There's now no reason not to play him/her until that power gets nerfed.\n\nI've played a good bit of Zoe since she came out.  I currently ban her if I'm not first pick.  Is that because I think she's extremely overpowered?  Not really, I've faced Zoe's mid and I know I can handle her.
