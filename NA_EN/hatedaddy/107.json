Damage has become the core aspect of this game.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":94,"down_votes":13,"body":"It is clear that Riot wants their game balanced around damage. Everything does damage, even supports. Riot does not want styles of play to vary greatly and would rather champions be viable based on the amount of damage they can do - everything else they bring to the table is just a benefit. These secondary traits are where the meta is then defined. If the majority of the champions bursting you down are tanks, it&rsquo;s a tank meta. If it&rsquo;s assassins, it&rsquo;s an assassin meta. If it&rsquo;s mages, it&rsquo;s a mage meta. Damage is simply like flash at this point based on years of horrible balancing concepts: every needs it and every does it, so it just exists in the background as an after thought rather than a special feature.\r\n\r\nThis is also why I was never keen on the term &ldquo;damage creep&rdquo; because it implies riot has accidentally raised damage and the damage in the game is a miscalculated side effect of poor balancing. It&rsquo;s not. It was calculated and it continues to be because riot balances in a lazy fashion. Rather than allow unique designs to carry through other means (disruption, engaging, split pushing, objective power, utility in genera), Riot balances so that carrying is done one way: damage and burst. As unique as all of these different kits are, Riot has created one way to carry and that is why so many of these champions are prone to abuse (tanks killing everything; adcs having burst; utility mages/supports having burst potential because AP itemization is valued by its damage and not its passives or uniqueness). And this is honestly why the game has become trash because strategy is out the window and everyone just deathball zergs down middle for 25 minutes until someone knocks themselves out on a brick wall after banging their head on it for that entire duration.","replies":[{"poster":"Åshe","date":"2018-11-30T14:38:57.525+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"League is the CoD of the MOBA genre.","replies":[{"poster":"Cavesloth","date":"2018-12-01T01:58:33.344+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, if I wanted to play COD I'd play COD.

China has become increasingly important in terms of player numbers and viewer numbers for Riot and League of Legends. Other games have come out in the West like Overwatch, Fortnite and PUBG that have taken players away from LoL and the MOBA genre is no longer top dog. Meanwhile the game continues to be massive in the Asian market.\n\nIts safe to say that Asia is the MOST important market for LoL at this time. Do you honestly think that if market research determined that Asians like faster paced, higher damage and shorter games that Riot wouldnt modify the game to maximize their profits in the region with their largest player base? Clearly they would not outright acknowledge this, because while the West is less important and they are willing to sacrifice some numbers there they want to alienate as few as possible. Its for this reason they continue to make the game faster paced while remaining silent to the complaints, they are walking a fine line changing the game for the Asian market and at the same time trying to avoid upsetting Western players.\n\n If you honestly think that Riot is more concerned with Western players than making money then you're incredibly naive about business and the ways of the world.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Death by Glamour","date":"2018-11-30T15:07:13.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When did they aquire the license to get the game into the chinese market ?","replies":[{"poster":"Leetri","date":"2018-11-30T16:04:11.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They released League on the Garena server in 2010, so they probably got the license a while before that.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2018-11-30T17:59:59.379+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dayvigilante,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NJkQFdN7,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-11-30T02:15:09.260+0000)\n>\n> Dealing damage to enemy champions was, at some point, not a core part of the game? \n\nYes, but not 3000 damage in 3 seconds or less.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI've posted some screenshots here:\nhttps://1drv.ms/f/s!AuFMZD__7mN2kCXsIoEUpRDXFgjG","replies":[{"poster":"HyperTechno","date":"2018-12-01T00:28:11.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PaladinNO,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NJkQFdN7,comment-id=00000002,timestamp=2018-11-30T17:59:59.379+0000)\n>\n> Yes, but not 3000 damage in 3 seconds or less.\n\nNever been done.

Only a DPS champion like Yi or Jax would almost be able to reach those feet, but even they cannot reach that level of damage in three seconds on a tank or bruiser. The max time it would take them would be 6 seconds if they keep hitting the target if they are ahead. Else, the number is unrealistic.\n\nSecondly, only one shows 3000 damage in three seconds, even that is inaccurate since you had 2899 health, and you go hit by a fucking three-man. Rengar was ahead, while you had no armor as Orianna, buy a {{item:3157}}, I am not surprised he one-shot you. Shaco killed you because you build no armor, also because he is at full build, again not surprised.\n\nThirdly, trying to justify the OP damage argument on ARAM games is stupid in itself. In ARAM you will always snowball faster than in a regular game. So this Bs you can go somewhere else with.\n\nSome advice, League is not all about damage. It is about how you can do damage while staying alive. Prioritizing damage over strategy is Bronze level ideology. Even when you got Urgot, you build zero sustain, armor, or any survival items. Except for {{item:3022}}. Also by looking at your score, 3/8/8, it is no surprise that you would die with ease.","replies":[{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2018-12-01T20:52:48.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HyperTechno,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NJkQFdN7,comment-id=00000002000000000000,timestamp=2018-12-01T18:50:36.101+0000)\n>\n> Secondly, only one shows 3000 damage in three seconds, even that is inaccurate since you had 2899 health, and you go hit by a fucking three-man.

Even Zed, Zoe, and many burst champions will have a hard time dealing enough damage to one-shot them. Tanks and bruisers have a much larger armor, MR, and health growth than other champions.
