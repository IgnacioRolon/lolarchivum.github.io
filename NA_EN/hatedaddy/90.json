{"poster":"HateDaddy","date":"2015-08-20T03:11:42.484+0000","title":"Dear Gameplay and Balance: tanks are going to be fine in 5.16, don't worry.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":46,"down_votes":19,"body":"Now before you bombard me in downvotes, please, I ask that you read this and allow me to explain exactly why. Some of this is perception, some of this is reality. \r\n\r\nLet&#039;s start off with this: tanks have been good for *a long time.* When was the last time Maokai top wasn&#039;t a tier 1 top laner? Mid-season 4? Mundo? He&#039;s always off and on, never a bad pick (not so much for solo queue, but we will get to that). Sion? Still off and on, was tier 1 by far for a long time. I would still consider him tier 2. Shen is back. Gragas is still God tier. Braumstache is back in full swing. Nautilus top is still tier 1 and will continue to be, tier 2 in support alongside champions like Leona. I have no idea why people stopped playing Sej, she&#039;s still very good. Do I need to even explain Alistar atm?\r\n\r\nI&#039;m telling you this now: none of this is going to change next patch. Figjters were buffed, but fighters will now actually function as fighters - not champions that stack resists and abuse base damages, something that has often pushed tanks out of the meta in top lane entirely (See Renekton/Trundle/Shyv in s3/early s4). Tanks will be good in accompany with bruisers (support tanks especially) and traditional tank tops will be reliable counterrpicks to shut them down, in fact i suspect tanks will thrive at this. \r\n\r\nNow, I realize armor items overall received a nerf in value and in cost effeciency. However, there&#039;s more variety in armor itemization that excels at different things. Deadmans plate will be god-tier on anything looking to hard engage, tanks and figjters alike. Randuins will help vs crit stacking carries. Sunfire will probably resurface as a premier item in top lane. Frozen Heart is still ridiculously good. MR also just got buffed, which helps top lane tanks mostly. Locket is still good for supports. \r\n\r\nBut here&#039;s the thing, true tanks are still innately ridiculously durable, these changes won&#039;t push them out of the game. And that hasn&#039;t changed, nor will it. And that&#039;s why riot gave buffs to different tanks armor that don&#039;t typically acquire a lot of gold, just to make sure they didn&#039;t overdo it on the armor changes, and I don&#039;t think they did. \r\n\r\nIn reality, the only things that have changed are the strength of tank junglers (and this is mostly a competitive thing) and I&#039;ll get to that, and eliminating tanks like Maokai, Gragas and nautilus from soloing carries while being unkillable. That was an unhealthy style of play and it blurred the line between tanks and bruisers/fighters. These changes give bruisers their identities back via direct changes to them, item changes for them and item changes for tanks. This change will redefine both bruisers roles and tanks roles, turning tanks into what they&#039;re supposed to be: disrupters, damage soakers and initiators, not champions that dive back lines and solo carries until those carries have 5-6 items to actually kill them. Trust me, tanks will be good and if you&#039;re a tank player, you&#039;re not going to lose your power to disrupt and soak damage. That&#039;s still in tact.\r\n\r\nNow, as for jungle tanks. Here&#039;s the deal fellas, in competitive league of legends, tanks in the jungle have never really been balanced. They&#039;re either so obnoxiously overtuned directly or through itemixation that they&#039;re completely overpowered with just 2-3 items alone (because in competitive play, the jungle role is especially starved on income). This is the only way they see competitive play, otherwise they&#039;re just not considered good. That&#039;s still a big problem and riot has been actively trying to figure that out for the last 2 years. I don&#039;t know the answer to it either, to be honest.\r\n\r\nHowever, that said, solo queue-wise, tank junglers are still going to be extremely powerful. They still have been, despite the recent runeglaive and devourer junglers dominating solo queue as well. Champs like Sej, Amumu, Gragas etc always have pretty good winrates because in solo queue, tank junglers are much more likely to get gold since you won&#039;t be sacrificing your camps and exp to the rest of your team, and it&#039;s hard to coordinate efforts to shut them down early when they&#039;re vulnerable. \r\n\r\n\r\nSo long story short folks, tanks are still going to be good. Bruisers will be back and I suspect this patch could see the most balanced diversity we&#039;ve had in a very long time. \r\n\r\nAs always, thanks for reading this, lovers.","replies":[{"poster":"Fadedpf","date":"2015-08-20T03:19:19.026+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":32,"body":"http://media.lolusercontent.com/api/embedly/1/image/resize?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.lolusercontent.com%2Fapi%2Fembedly%2F1%2Fimage%2Fresize%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fmedia2.giga.de%252F2014%252F11%252FSerious.gif%26key%3Da45e967db0914c7fb472fd4381e6c85b%26width%3D425&key=a45e967db0914c7fb472fd4381e6c85b&width=425","replies":[{"poster":"HateDaddy","date":"2015-08-20T03:23:26.601+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ThatAtheist,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=imsknG3A,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-08-20T03:19:19.026+0000)\n>\n> http://media.lolusercontent.com/api/embedly/1/image/resize?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.lolusercontent.com%2Fapi%2Fembedly%2F1%2Fimage%2Fresize%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fmedia2.giga.de%252F2014%252F11%252FSerious.gif%26key%3Da45e967db0914c7fb472fd4381e6c85b%26width%3D425&key=a45e967db0914c7fb472fd4381e6c85b&width=425\n\nThat was a very well written argument that cited several different sources and presented irrefutable evidence. 10/10","replies":[]},{"poster":"65wQhMlGlT","date":"2015-08-20T04:17:51.241+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"What is up with this gif, this is like the 5th time I've seen it today.","replies":[{"poster":"Fadedpf","date":"2015-08-20T04:18:53.758+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"a spiderman movie","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"7ha7guy777","date":"2015-08-20T03:43:55.426+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Is it just me, or does it seem like the new items (sterak's, titanic, DMP) could be crazy on voli?","replies":[{"poster":"HateDaddy","date":"2015-08-20T03:52:20.221+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=7ha7guy777,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=imsknG3A,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-08-20T03:43:55.426+0000)\n>\n> Is it just me, or does it seem like the new items (sterak's, titanic, DMP) could be crazy on voli?\n\nOh yeah, they're great on bruisers and tanks alike and Voli is very hybrid in that regard.

I do think Lee and Kha will see more play, bear in mind though that bruisers absolutely maul assassins. So how much more powerful are they going to be? Tanks were effective against them for that matter, too.\n\nWhat made AD assassins good in mid lane was a combination of nerfs to several different mages (remember all the nerfs to Ziggs, etc) and generally being overtuned a bit. Mid is dominated right now by really safe wave clearers and Ahri, who is good vs most AD assassins. And those ad assassins aren't getting mega buffs, so I don't suspect we will be seeing mid lane be the showdown lane for Zed v Talon 2.0.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-08-20T04:29:46.317+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well spoken.

Hell,the notion that amumu is strong is highly debatable.\n\nSee their winrate comes from a bunch of things,the biggest factor being easy to play+relying on your opponents to play stupid and not to adapt,and even with that sejuani is sitting on 50%.\n\nNow why would a person who is a good jungler pick sejuani if these are her strengths? the person is already a good jungler,so her being easy isn't a factor,why rely on his opponent being bad when he can pick something like reksai which is strong even against strong opponents?\n\nThe winrate argument is shit,if you go by it then you just pick the highest winrate champion and there's no room for anything else,while champions being simpler might be a reason for bad junglers to pick them up,that doesn't give a reason for experienced junglers to do so,and these are the guys we want to balance jungle around.\n\n\n>Nautilus functions well as a tank jungler, as does Gragas, as does Amumu.

And at last years worlds, Ryze was extremely overpowered, it's what he was nerfed. But at the same time, Maokai top was still good, mundo top was still good. Alistar was being built trinity into full tank or sometimes even AP, but he was still incredibly tanky. They also removed his ability to solo lane entirely (not a single thing was lost this day) when they removed his AA/W combo. Tanks were still good in top lane season 4, just not at worlds as much because riot typically goes through this obsession where they buff Ryze right before worlds  to ruin top lane makns experiences in the game.\n\n> When was the last time he was picked in a pro game? His non-pro win rate is abysmal. \n\nPerception vs reality here, mundo is basically old Shen - never a bad pick, probably just outclassed (Gnar). He's safe, farms well, tanks well etc. He also hasn't had a good winrate in solo queue since s2 since they killed his ability to jungle. I wouldn't mind mundo jungle buffs.\n\n> If by \"long time\" you mean \"3 patches\", then sure.

But I see no reason why tanks will suddenly be bad.\n \n> This is absolutely false. Here's why: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3_i1TZSDGs\n\nStonewall video, not watching because he's historically been extremely bias for tanks.\n\nEDIT: ROFL that video is from February, before tanks were literally the most broken class in the game for 2-3 patches. Prior to this, he wasn't wrong, but his bias that \"bruisers outclass\" tanks was incorrect given half of season 4 before worlds was Mundo/Maokai top every game and bruisers were dead. So that video is outdated, the good points he did make in it were addressed and he even has the same philosophy of what a true tank as that I have: disruptors, damage soakers and innate durability *that don't bring the power in damage to solo kill back line champions.* They weren't doing that with base damages or high base damages, they were doing it with extremely powerful tank itemization combined with their already extremely powerful innate durability and simply outlasting entire teams as they whittled a carry down to nothing. \n\n> The only \"variety\" is the fact that you have ONE MORE armor item to choose from. And arguably, {{item:3742}} came out in 5.15 so you don't have anymore variety from 5.16.\n\nYes, this was still buff to armor overall. Once again, the armor nerfs barely hurt true tanks because they've already got innate defensive mechanics such as %dmg reduction or flat and/or %resists increases. These armor nerfs were to scale them down a little bit because tanks have been incredibly powerful for the last few patches and this likely doesn't hurt them much. This will also likely discourage fighters that traditionally build more defenses to just spam tank items and abuse bases, something that is always a potential abuse case and I'm saying that *as a fighter main.*\n\n> Nerf {{item:3800}} out of the game and introduce {{item:3742}}. You have less engage power and more selfish stats. From one hand giveth, the other taketh away. \n\nI'm with you here believe it or not, this is one of the few items I think was way overnerfed. I wouldn't be surprised to see it buffed again soon.\n\n> And yet its stats are suspiciously similar to how they were in season 2/3 when NOBODY ever bought it. \n\nFrozen heart was good on season 2. Maokai jungle built it, perma ban Malphite built it, Taric built it. Randuins in s2 was just a lot better overall, not to mention the meta of s2 rarely featured many AS heavy carries (Corki/graves/Ez). It was the last season where fighters consistently dominated, which is why Randuins was more common and it built from hog, so it was a gold income item too. FH was good the. It will still be good now.\n\n> MR was not buffed if you take into account the fact that {{item:3105}} got nerfed. You get 5 more MR from individual MR items but 5 less MR from {{item:3105}}. Overall, you just got a 50g reduction. That's it.\n\nBanshees and spirit visage + cowl got buffed, which is still a buff to solo lane tanks who build these items and once again, true tanks aren't hurt by it much because of innate defensive steroids like Leona, Braum etc.\n\n> Yes they will, and they will be replaced by Bruisers for reasons noted in the above YouTube video I linked.\n\nMaybe they will be for a short time because there's a good chance the new bruiser items could be way overtuned and that'll get adjusted. Tanks will still be meta in bot lane and top lane won't have Maokai being mandatory. We just had 4 patches in a row of heavy tanky comps until runeglaive was a thing, we could stand for a little diversity. \n\n> So nerf their damage, not their tankyness. Oh wait, they nerfed both ({{item:3075}} {{item:3143}})\n\nOnce again, true tanks aren't going to feel these nerfs because it's small reduction in values when they're already innately absurdly durable. Their damage wasn't the problem, it was their durability in conjunction with extremely cost efficient items that was. \n\n> Again, you are saying their damage is the problem so NERF THE DAMAGE FROM THEIR KITS. Don't fucking nerf their survivability. The amount of stupidity in your argument is unreal.\n\nSee above, keep trying to insult me though, you're flattering me.\n\n\n> YOU LITERALLY CONTRADICTED YOURSELF HERE. You're saying \"tanks should be good at soaking damage and initiating\" and then you IMMEDIATELY SAY they should not be diving back lines and requiring carries to have more damage to kill them.\n\nDiving and soloing carries and initiating aren't the same thing. \n\n> LMAO ARE YOU KIDDING ME. You must be new to this game if you think this for a SECOND. Could you remind yourself of the last time tank items were nerfed in this magnitude? Go read the patch notes before Worlds last year and then go watch Worlds last year. You're a fucking idiot who clearly doesn't understand this game.\n\nI'm diamond, have been diamond elo for almost two years and I'd like to think I have an incredibly unbias point of view (as best as possible). I play some tanks too, I get the frustration but armor itemization is not what made or broke true tanks, they're going to be fine. Tanks were also buffed in compensation for some of these nerfs as well, so please continue to ignore that. There's also a nerf for Maokai on the PBE on his ults cooldown, I don't think it's necessary and I hope it's reverted. \n\nI want diversity, and we have been slowly getting that over the last few patches.\nPrior to that it was mega tank comps, prior to that it was Lee sin/Vi/RekSai and tank tops, prior to that it was Ryze v3, prior to that it was mundo vs Maokai, prior to that it was Renekton/Shyv/Trundle/Nasus/Zac/Shen/Vlad top from season 3 carrying over to season 4. Then it was Ryze  2.0 and ranged too CANCER mid s3 and the rest is history. This is the most diversity we could potentially be seeing from both top lane and jungle in a very long time, potentially ever (excluding the first two seasons at this point because it was a different game). Having the game be mega tank comps isn't balanced, or fun to play in. Having the meta be Lee/Vi every game isn't fun to play in. In reality we went from one extreme to the other and over the last two patches, that somewhat happened with overtuned runeglaive. But it looks like we are seeing more diversity and that's a good thing for this game.\n\nI know you don't like that because you're an incredibly bias tank main who thinks the game should have 3 unkillable tanks every game and that's what balance is but it isn't, you're wrong. You can throw around misinformation all you want, bias and extremely inaccurate depictions as you please, insult me, whatever, it doesn't change the fact that tanks, true tanks at their core, have never been reliant on itemization, it's been from the core makeup of their kits and we've seen tanks in top lane come and go a ton since s3. We've seen the same in the support role as well since s3, we saw it some in the jungle and I admit that's a hard one to figure because historically jungle tanks have been a nightmare to balance, and don't take my word for it, just look at history and it speaks for itself. Whenever jungle tanks have been good, they've been hilariously overpowered and no in between. When they've been bad, welp they were fucking bad.  \n\nSo once again, now that I've gotten past this novel I've just written, *tanks are fine*. And show some faith, in the event I'm wrong - which is something I have no problem admitting I always could be and would own up to if I was - riot has been proactively buffing anything perceived weak in the last year and a half moreso than I've ever seen them do. So in the event I am wrong and tanks are absolute garbage now, riot will jump on board and work hard at figuring it out.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"T RexHasTinyArms","date":"2015-08-20T21:15:56.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you think would be the impact if you removed the scaling health entirely from cinderhulk and normalized the passive damage to match sunfire?

They&#039;re either so obnoxiously overtuned directly or through itemixation that they&#039;re completely overpowered with just 2-3 items alone (because in competitive play, the jungle role is especially starved on income). This is the only way they see competitive play, otherwise they&#039;re just not considered good. That&#039;s still a big problem and riot has been actively trying to figure that out for the last 2 years. I don&#039;t know the answer to it either, to be honest.\n\nThe answer is jungle tanks should be really strong, and then everyone wins.

Sure, competitive is a different style and that style isn't achieved in solo queue obviously but the gameplay, style of game, meta and the whole 9 yards trickle down from competitive to begin with.

Their job is to disrupt, soak damage and initiate, not solo backlines because they abuse base damages while being unkillable. \n\n\n> I love watching Vayne kill 5 people with 11 autos and watching Zed ult into 4 people, press R, kill someone and get out for free.  Good times.\n\nVayne wouldn't kill 5 people with 11 autos, Vayne is also susceptible to dive because of her short range. I won't argue she's bullshit though, and I agree I want her nerfed in the worst way possible. But Vayne IS an ADC and a tankbuster at that, it's what she's designed to do. But this isn't about Vayne. And in that same sentence, Zed doesn't just R in, R out and kill carries if the enemy team has half a brain. That only happens in the most extreme cases of when a Zed is fed. I know the people on this board have an irrational hate for Zed because they don't actually understand his gameplay, how easily countered he is by itemization and that he's actually not very good at the moment, but it's not that simple. It never was.","replies":[{"poster":"NeX Daark","date":"2015-08-20T08:44:29.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HateDaddy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=imsknG3A,comment-id=0009000000010000,timestamp=2015-08-20T08:02:02.876+0000)\n>\n> No, it doesn't. It makes solo queue better because the entire meta trickles down from professional play to begin with. Sure, competitive is a different style and that style isn't achieved in solo queue obviously but the gameplay, style of game, meta and the whole 9 yards trickle down from competitive to begin with. You balance around the highest level of play, you balance the game at the highest of quality.\n\n3/4 of the professional meta does not transition down past diamond.  Champion pool and itemization trickling down is most of what we see.  The rest can't be pulled off with 5 people that have never spoken to each other and half the team is playing their third or fourth best roles.\n\nBalancing around the top has been tried in nearly every video game.  The only thing those video games have in common is that none of them end up very balanced.\n\n> Tanks like Maokai late game soloing carries while you're unable to kill him isn't healthy gameplay, same with pre-nerf Sej, anything that went challenging smite + full tank.

If a level 18 item Maokai out plays an enemy team I don't have a problem with him being able to kill a lvl 16 Vayne.  Autolocking an adc should not give you free reign to ruin everyone.\n> \n> Vayne wouldn't kill 5 people with 11 autos, Vayne is also susceptible to dive because of her short range.

Vayne being a tank buster and 2 shotting anyone with less than 200 armor, and 4 shotting people with 260+ is balanced because that is what she is designed to do but Maokai and Sejuani living for more than 6 seconds is horrible?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JedenVojak","date":"2015-08-20T06:35:21.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HateDaddy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=imsknG3A,comment-id=00090000,timestamp=2015-08-20T06:12:49.666+0000)\n>\n> Honestly, I take your replies more as a joke than anything, I'm just not sure what else to say lol.\n\nYou can say, \" You really are amazing, I can't imagine why I would hold any other viewpoint, your Majesty.\"\n\nSorry, I'm just a little drunk right now.
