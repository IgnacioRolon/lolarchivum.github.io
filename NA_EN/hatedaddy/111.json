Look at any other site that carries these statistics for ranked and gives you the option to separate the winrates by ranks and you'll see over the past month, her winrate in both plat and diamond has been up and down from 41%-50%. It doesn't just statically stay at 41%, it changes a lot. And there's no way she's just at a straight 41% winrate - I just don't buy it. There's definitely very flawed data collecting there or it's extremely misleading. All champions have days where they can drop that low in winrate for a day or two, Shyv isn't different. She jumps up and down between 41% and 50% way too much and there's no way that leaves her at what I'd be comfortable saying a 41% winrate. \n\nBelieve me when I say she's extremely strong in top lane at the moment, even post challenging smite nerf. she has 3 difficult match ups: Renekton (who isn't even a champion anymore), Gnar and Vlad. And against both of them, she has room to play around and benefits largely from having extremely high base damages (keep %HP dmg in mind) and builds pure tank while being impossible to kite (Gnar can only kite her if he lands Qs, which Shyva burnout gives her MS making it easier to dodge). \n\nShe's not weak, she's probably not even overbearing either.

When I look through Lolking and her monthly winrate in plat and diamond, her winrate fluctuates from 41%-50%, which suggests what I said in my OP: she's an incredibly binary champion with very little decision making required. Buffing her is stupid, nobody enjoys playing against her. Give her a rework that makes her less cancer.","replies":[{"poster":"SnugglePuggle94","date":"2015-06-01T22:49:33.058+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"She doesn't need nerfed, and is fine just as is.
