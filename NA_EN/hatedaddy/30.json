It's so dumb!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":11,"down_votes":20,"body":"Yes because laning against Syndra for 5 months was a fucking blast and she definitely was loaded with counterplay. There&#039;s absolutely nothing wrong with Azir either, he&#039;s just constantly outplaying you from 1000+ range and behind walls. And there&#039;s absolutely nothing wrong with Veigar being able to stack his AP from 950 range off cooldown and add on more with kills/assists and teamfights happen and he throws Jarvan ults around. \r\n\r\nThese champions, who have conditional damage and have to get into melee range are definitely bullshit and shouldn&#039;t exist because you&#039;re only allowed to have limited counterplay if you&#039;re ranged and AP.\r\n\r\nMage mains man, smh","replies":[]}
