Minion block literally makes trading on any melee champion a nightmare.

You can no longer predict how minions will line up to fight your minions, they just randomly botch up under tower and your minions start aggroing them weirdly as a result, so you end up missing a lot of CS under tower because of how fucked their AI is.

It is exactly right. Minion block is a good thing - if there is no minion block, whoever is ahead in the lane can literally just sit on top of their minions and deny last hits with their character model.
