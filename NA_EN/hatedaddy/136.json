Cooldowns are so low now since riot basically hands out 40% CDR for free that even conventional methods (stacking HP to avoid burst) don’t work anymore because burst rotations are up so quickly again that even burst champions are practically DPSing. Couple this with the fact that AD/crit is still the best tank killing damage stat in the game, and your realize as a front liner that you can’t justify building more than one MR item + mercs because you’ll melt to the ADC, even if they’re not fed.

Zed has his rotation up by the time hourglass expires, so hourglass only saves you the detonated mark damage, which zed doesn't need to kill low armor targets with 3 Q's and an E.\n\nEkko loses the poke game against Zed in lane, Zed's WEQ combo can be done from 650 range, all he needs to do is land it once and wait for ekko's ult to catch up so he can ult after, while Ekko's range is not 650+.\n\nZed negates Katarina's Q buy ulting it, so she only gets at best a single dagger proc and her ult which isn't even enough to outburst a Zed with nullifying orb, and Zed's passive is actually relevant in lane unlike Katarina's resets which are mostly a teamfight feature.\n\n1 second of invulnerability that multiplies your damage and lets you peace out after a rotation while the damage is done after is far better than spinning like a stationary r%%%%% with the 1863927392 CC in the game that completely shuts down that ult whereas Zed can get CC and the ult window is still long enough for him to cast Q's in time and he E's immediately after coming out of ult anyways.\n\nAnd let's not even mention the massive scaling lead Zed has over the other assassins.\n\nSimply put, no other assassin but Zed could duel Revenge or Box Box's Rivens and come out on top, because no other assassins can duel bruisers with the exception of old tank Fizz and Ekko, who are dead.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KirbyCake","date":"2019-03-21T15:18:35.115+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"MR is incredibly overpowered in terms of the numbers.
