All this buff has done for lane Nasus is make him stomp harder when even against most champions or ahead - which is what he has always done. \r\n\r\nHowever, I’ve been seeing a lot of high elo streamers playing and complains about how absurd jungle Nasus is right now and that makes sense - theoretically, Nasus can obtain 100 stacks per each clear. As it stands, jungle Nasus is on par with lane Nasus in how quickly he stacks, in some cases jungle Nasus is stacking faster simply because 12 is more than 3. Sure, he’s prone to invades but those aren’t safe and you can take safe clearing paths now, especially if you do vertical jungling. Quite simply, it’s entirely possible that jungle Nasus is too good. \r\n\r\nWhy does this concern me? Obviously I am and have been a Nasus main since 2012. I’ve alwaya played him in the top lane and that’s more or less been his goto role baring season 3. Riot literally never reverts stupid changes, they just complicate their situation further by adding on several more stupid changes and inevitably dumpstering a champion until they get across the board buffs or a rework, neither of which Nasus really needs. He was honestly fine before these buffs for what it’s worth. However, now, what Riot will do will likely be taking stacks off his normal rate (go back to 2 instead of 3 like the old days), nerf wither range (again), nerf his ults cooldown or some other totally moronic change that will make him invariably worse and kill him in top lane altogether because of an idiotic change. \r\n\r\nRiot, I don’t know what made you think this was a good idea but please, if you decide its time to nerf Nasus, just revert this stupid change. Don’t try to say “ugh but Nasus jungle is a totally hip and secret strat that has a dedicated following” because that isn’t true. He’s a top lane and that’s how he should be balanced. Please come to your senses and decide that this is the correct change to make (reverting the +12 buff). \r\n\r\nSincerely yours, \r\n\r\nSomeone who is still playing your game after 7 years (a group of people you practically don’t acknowledge anymore).","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Wittrock","date":"2019-01-13T02:51:24.096+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":16,"body":"The potential strength of Nasus jungle is definitely on our radar.

I had the misfortune of having a Nasus on my team and had my own jungle demolished by my ally. Still won but it was much harder than it should have been, and I'll be honest, I came out of that game feeling worse than I normally do after losses. It was not fun at all.\n\nMaybe if it only stacks on enemy JG minions, or if you have a jungle item, that way as a laner he can hit enemy jungle, but as a jungler he can still hit his own.\n\nBy doing this it might also allow them to balance him around Jungle AND top lane at the same time by simply adjusting the stacks per kill.

Because he's so well known and players are hyper aware of how to play against him, he currently struggles a lot.\n\nNasus is in the same position in that regard.

Both can also be extremely devastating by mid/late game if left alone or ignroed. but that's always been a thing with Nasus, and again, is a thing with other champs as well.\n\nTL;DR He may see a little jungle play this season, but it'll mostly be very early on evolving into a mediocre jungle as opposed to previously non-viable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bløød Zerø","date":"2019-01-12T17:02:58.501+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh if they truly wanted to give nasus a balanced buff they could have made every normal minion and small monster give 4 stacks and every cannon or large monster and champion 8 allowing nasus to reliably be able to farm lanes under tower he would lose and when the wave isn't under his tower he can go clear his side gromp for 8 stacks.\n\n Like this way he still needs to prioritize cannons but also needs to know wave management, and his lane matchups. \n\nAlso adding the 1 to 2 extra stacks wouldn't be outrageous of a buff because everyone already knows if he gets ahead for some bs reason due to not shutting his farming down he's go8ng to be heavily stacked anyways. \n\nWith adding those extra 1 to 2 stacks compared to making large monsters and minions 12 is also great cus if you practice farming with him you will get rewarded. Instead now I see this impactful role taken by a champ who can't bring the impact needed for jg just because some stupidity like he gets stacks faster. Sorry Susan but idc if you get more stacks faster I care about jungle pressure and objectives.\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moonscourge","date":"2019-01-12T11:12:17.278+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"No, because he is still absolute trash.

Nasus wins most matchups post 6 once he gets sheen regardless of stacks, so that’s not really a problem either. His biggest issue is that he’s easy to camp and dive early on and this buff doesn’t change that. I don’t care if Nasus jungle is good either but if it comes at the expense of Nasus top, then I absolutely care. And historically, Riot doesn’t revert buffs either - they do random shit to “enhance strengths but make weaknesses more noticeable.” In other words, they fuck the champion all up.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon Gerrard","date":"2019-01-12T07:15:30.656+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well keep in mind that Nasus is worthless if the whole enemy team is ahead. He's super heavy single target damage. The team falls behind really fast then he can't do anything about it regardless on how he does in lane.

In this day and age where the games are very fast paced, Riot's past two changes to Nasus have been major buffs to speed him up. His ultimate change that decreases the cooldown of his Q and now the +12 change to cannons, large monsters, and champions. If you're a smart player then you'll know to try and hurt him while he tries to go for a cannon to either take out a lot of his health or force him to miss it. If you're jungler is smart, he'll know to get a good early game camp against him to try and keep him down enough for you to gain a lead and for you to able to abuse that lead while you out damage him. There's also the matter of learning to control the flow of the lane by learning how to freeze the waves to make it harder for Nasus to be able to come close to farm without you blowing up his health bar. There are a LOT of champions that can easily abuse a lead on Nasus and keep him down.
