He's so predictable and has to eat your harass for free. And if you rush sunfire cape (like I do) you will have the armour to fuck him.

I've done that lane once and it was honestly one of the easiest of my life. I guess you could suggest that the Jax was bad, but fact of the matter is that I out-damaged him purely stat-wise and out-tanked him. I even disrespected him by taking scaling MR (because fuck his W and ult passive) instead of flat. I think this might have also been the game I accidentally took Strength of the Ages.

Sure, you can ask but good luck because again, getting someone to be responsive in champ select is like pulling teeth.
