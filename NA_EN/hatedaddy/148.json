So, feel free to correct me if I'm speaking to something else below:\n\n**1)  Armor and MR don't have diminishing returns.**  EHP scales linearly with armor, such that each point of armor adds 1% of your HP to your EHP.  The first point of armor adds the same amount to your EHP as the 100th point does.  The diminishing returns myth comes about because players look at damage reduction, which is the inverse of EHP and therefore doesn't scale linearly with defense (and thank god it doesn't as the difference between 100% damage reduction and 99% is immortality while 10% from 9% is a modest ~1% increase in EHP).  \n\n**2)  This point of yours seems to be taking a good many liberties.**  When does Shyvana have 1235 health?  Level 9?  I can look at level 1 instead and show ruby crystal outperforms long sword in percent increase to their respective stats, per gold spent.  \n\nEven beyond that, how do you compare different stats' utility/value?  Are you creating a metric like EHP*DPS?  Do tanks based on disruption benefit from DPS as much as GP does?  Same question for carries and EHP relative to those tanks.   \n\n**3)  Lastly, does your treatment have an explanation for those metas where tanks have been dominant?**  Based on stat costs and considerations of %increase/gold spent, I don't see any room for other context.  \n\nPS)  You can only take someone to negative armor/MR through amassing enough reduction to do it alone.  Penetration will never take someone below zero, nor will reduction on top of penetration.  Not sure if you were just using negative values for an extension to allow you to motivate the use of an exponential, but those values are almost never going to happen.","replies":[{"poster":"Picanha96","date":"2016-08-19T14:18:44.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Elasticitty is the Mathematical Sensitivity.

It sounds like diminishing returns to scale is at best speaking to the fact that offense scales harder than defense (intended, and again, says nothing about why tank metas have occurred).  At worst it seems like it's willfully ignoring the other defensive stats (health becomes more attractive as you purchase more armor), or even worse making an obvious commentary that the first 10 points of armor are a larger percentage increase in your armor than are the 10 that take you from 200 to 210.  \n\nAnd beyond all of that, I still want to know how you compare the utility/value of offense to defense in your post.  Are you considering some combined metric of EHP*DPS such that you can argue the faster stat doubling for attack makes it the more attractive stat?  Wouldn't this treatment also make crit-scaling look superior to all other scalings?  How well does that agree with metas in which we only see 1 ADC per team (and, currently, ADCs that avoid building crit)?

If such a treatment of stats' relative value suggests crit wins out (and it will: crit outscales everything), yet players aren't picking crit-users to deal damage, there's obviously something missing from the discussion.  Likely it's the fact that autoattack damage isn't what you should be considering for how offense scales, and spell damage scales much more slowly than does attack damage.\n \n> Why the hell Does what the Oponent Build affect my Build input.\n> \n> Effective Damage is the same multiplicative inverse of Damage Reduction\n> \n> It &quot;uses&quot; the Same Elasticity as Armour and Magic Resistance do!\n>\n> The more Armour or Magic Resistance to Penetrate the less the Damage Increases.\n> \n> And Penetration cannot go Below 0 So Even Against Squishes you won&#x27;t build Penetration out of Runes because you can&#x27;t go Below 0 and you won&#x27;t risk the least inefficiency!\n\nNot sure what you're arguing here.  I think we're both in agreement that EHP is the relevant defensive stat, and that it's linear in armor such that each point of armor increases EHP by the same amount.  I don't really see how we can calculate the value of penetration without considering the opponent's build, and certainly not effective damage.  \n\n> We are talking about effective health not just armour!\n\nOne's linear in the other.

It's good against tanks when you also have % armour pen.\n\nIf you have 250 armour, 80 of which is base and the enemy champ has a build like {{item:3142}} {{item:3036}} {{item:3071}} then flat pen is effective against you. In this case you'd be reduced to 174 by LDR, 121 by TBC and 101 by Ghostblade meaning the Ghostblade is giving a substantial difference in armour values in this case, equivalent to ~17% armour pen, which considering the other stats this item gives is very high.\n\nThat's why flat pen is very efficient on certain ADCs and allows them to take on tanks efficiently. Where an ADC doesn't need crit as in the cases of Lucian or Jhin a build with these 3 items is capible of dealing with tanks.\n\nEven in cases where LDR isn't built these builds are capable of downing tanks, the problem is that they shouldn't be. Building items like {{item:3142}} and {{item:3147}} should trade your ability to deal with tanks for more damage against squishies. The problem is that these items stack too efficiently with {{item:3071}} . Using the 250 armour example from before TBC shreds to 175 then pen reduces to 145. This is enough to deal with a tank, it's not the best but it doesn't have to be because it does other things that other builds can't.\n\nWhat most people suggest with pen is swapping the order of pen to be like what it was in S2, where flat pen applies before %pen. What this would mean is that your pen would reduce to 220 then TBC would reduce to 154, meaning the build losses some of its effect against tanks in a tradeoff for it's anti carry nature.","replies":[{"poster":"HateDaddy","date":"2016-08-18T02:42:23.226+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"Here's the problem with this entire concept \n\n20 flat pen is still 20 flat pen.

Lucian kills squishy targets in a single double tap combo. Other ADCs need 3 AAs at least in a scenario where they crit every single auto attack, your chance of doing this in an independent system (which LoL's crit system isn't) is 16.64%, in LoL's system it's even lower because your chance to crit is adjusted based off of your previous attacks. \n\nIn your best case scenario with let's say 1.5 AS that's still 2 seconds of attacking, do you think Lucian takes that long to kill?\n\nIn a more realistic scenario you need 4-5 AAs since the most probabilistic scenario for 4 AAs is 2 crits and 2 normals. That's 2-3 seconds to kill, which is actually a significant time.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
