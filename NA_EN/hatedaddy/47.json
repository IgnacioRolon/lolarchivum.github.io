Furthermore, ignore your own bad plays while also continuing to point out the bad plays I’ve made. After that, spam my summoner spells, spam ping that I’m alive (or dead). As long as you continue to do these things, there’s no way I’m going to be distracted. I’ll absolutely be able to focus on micro plays in between farming to catch back up on gold and EXP.\r\n\r\n so again, I cannot stress it enough: continue to be an unrelenting d-bag that does not let up at all. Make sure to point out every flaw I have, becauE your college professors are watching and the more you do this, the more extra credit you’ll get. Also, future employers are watching so please keep in mind that showing me up and turning an entire team against me by egging them on is a great way to build team cohesiveness and is a fantastic strategy to prevent division amongst a team. Make sure you ignore your score, your farm and your play though. People in the real world don’t actually like people who self-evaluate, it’s a sign of weakness and anti-intellectualism. Being a decent human being isn’t attractive at all, girls (or boys depending on which way you swing) want edgy little soldiers that flip their lid over the smallest of things. It’s important for you to ruin everyone else’s experience, too! If you do this, you can absolutely look back and say “haha well I showed him, that guy on the internet, whom I’ll never see again.” This is a great way to fix your suffering self-confidence. \r\n\r\nTL;DR, people make bad plays. It’s fine to point it out and even discuss it, but there’s no reason to be a complete dickwad about it. People are trying to actually enjoy the game in the limited time they have.","replies":[]}
