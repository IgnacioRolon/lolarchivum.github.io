Period.\r\n\r\nI enjoy a lot of immobile champions because they have a lot of unique features that separate them from other champions. From build paths to abilities, immobile champions feel more rewarding when played well. I feel like I did some cool shit as Nasus or Mordekaiser when I manage to flank from behind and separate the enemy team as Nasus with positioning and timing my rush. I feel awesome when I can successfully get an enemy ADC as my pet as Mordekaiser, which is actually hard as fuck to do. I feel awesome when I wait for the right moment as Olaf to pop ghost/ult and chain axes and dive an enemy carry. I feel awesome as Cho'Gath when I land a clutch rupture on someone by predicting where they'll jump to and feasting them to either kill them or force them out of the fight.\r\n\r\nAnd that's why immobile champions like that are immobile. When played well and positioned properly, they have potentially game changing mechanics and features that can turn the tides of a fight. But that is slowly dwindling away if it hasn't alteady. As an immobile champion, you're late game fantasy that Riot loves to preach almost never exists. With spammable slows, spammable mobility, spammable cc on RANGED CHAMPIONS galore, I feel like half the time I'm just wasting time trying to play these champions. The risk I take for picking these champions doesn't really feel rewarding even when I perform well during their most exploitable times (lane phase mostly).\r\n\r\nAnd then you get into other shit before a \"late game fantasy\" can even be realized. I love Mordekaiser, but I don't play him much anymore because it just feels pointless. So many junglers can show up to my lane and simply kill me by existing. Which I get that, he's immobile and he shoves, he has to have a weakness. But champions like Jarvan, Lee Sin, Vi, etc. make it to the point where they show up and you HAVE TO flash and thus, your lane is now over. Again, I fully understand this risk and that this is his counter play but taking this risk feels pointless because half the time, I get shut down in lane and the other half, when I do perform well and ward and keep gank free, I get cc'd once and instantly blow up. \r\n\r\nIt's gotten to the point where only ranged adcs and a select few AP carries can only have a late game fantasy. Champions like Nasus, Tryndamere, Olaf, etc., who you look at and think \"God damn, this guy gets items and he's terrifying\" are shut down by the push of a button with slows, random CC and then on top of that, if they manage to break through this, their target just blinks away like nothing. So why bother? Just split push, towers can't kite. But that strategy is fucking lame. I don't want to afk split push, bring 2-3 people up to stop me and depend on my team to cash in on their over commitment to stopping me. That's lame for me, that's lame for my team, that's lame for the enemy team and that's lame for the guy I have to lane against because he can basically never leave. But what choice do I have? I don't want to play whatever fotm overtuned, random cc full, random mobility filled garbage of an excuse designed champion comes out next, I want to play the champions I enjoy playing so I have to adapt. And I have to adapt because directly and indirectly, they've had their late game fantasy taken away.\r\n\r\nAnything tha threatens the greatness of adcs and those select few ap mids/assassins late game gets instantly crushed with nerfs. To the point that you don't want your champions to become popular, you know what will happen if they do. Why can't ranged adcs have their late game fantasy punished? Why can't some of the mid assassins and mages who can carry have their late game punished? Scratch that, most of them will have it punished. Itemization by far continues to favor ranged adcs late game, mid game and even early game. Sure, other classes get s few items here and there but it's not enough.\r\n\r\nAnd what I'm saying about this whole late game fantasy and the risk/reward of picking some of these immobile, supposedly godlike late game champions has so many layers of shit that fucks them over, I don't even know where to begin or where to end. Actually, it basically ends at \"who's adc is better late game and which adc plays better late game.\" But that's only a fraction of it. There's so much shit that involves this, from shit like Lee Sin, to poor itemization, to defensive itemization blowing ass and having few variety (mostly MR), to random max health % dmg galore, to random cc on everything new, to random mobility on everything new, random slows galore and the kitchen sink. It doesn't end and it only continues to get worse.\r\n\r\nI realize this is hardly a coherent post. But im just so fed up with feeling like I play extremely well on these champions only to get outperformed by other shit because they simply have more stuff and random power thrown into their kits. So in the end, the tl;dr of this entire rant is that this game isn't fun for me anymore. And I hate saying that because I love League of Legends, but everything the balance team, new champion design team and itemization team has done has legit shit on the champions I play while throwing them random insignificant bones here and there. Pick this apart and rage at me as you will, I really don't care. I'm just fed up.","replies":[{"poster":"Joe Dredd","date":"2014-12-29T22:57:02.680+0000","up_votes":44,"down_votes":2,"body":"That's a long ass wall of text m8\nedit*\nActually started reading to the that's lame part.

I could go on for pages about all the shit that frustrates me because as I said, there's so many layers to this that its honestly impossible for me to know where to start and where to begin.\n\nAs for split pushing, I like it as a strategy to an extent. But when it's afk split pushing, both the person doing it and the person defending it have their in game choices robbed from them. The split pusher is doing it because he literally can't do anything else and the one fighting it can't leave or his inhib is gone by 20 minutes. Riot talks about people having choices but split pushers have no choice for the most part, they can't do anything else. And that is honestly fucking lame.","replies":[{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2014-12-30T06:16:24.150+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely understand what you mean. I for one am a huge fan of both Nasus and Morde. Morgana was my first mained champion, and I still love her to this day. \n\nHowever, even though that I am a fan of the low mobility champs as well, I have also taught myself how to play with some decently mobile champs as well. Diana is a champ that I can wreck the enemy team with, and although she is classified as a fighter, I play her more as an assassin. Since I have played her so much, I have learned to be patient with her, choose the right time and the right target to go in on. In fact, the last game I played with her, I impressed even myself. I let the tanks engage, soak up most of the damage and cc, then went onto the fed enemy Riven who probably didn't even notice I was on her until she was dead. We won the game after that fight.\n\nThis patience has transfered quite nicely over to the immobile champions. You can't get onto your opponents, so you have to wait for them to come to you, especially when playing Morde. You don't have to split push, you can push with your team, and if the enemy engages onto to you, you can then charge the backline and cause as much chaos as possible. The more patience you have, the more objectives you will take, and the more team fights you will win.\n\nTry that kind of strategy, and you just may see yourself having a bit more fun as you dare your opponents to dive you in all chat. :D","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TheKingDodo","date":"2014-12-30T02:36:05.185+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just increase MS of all non-dash champs/non-long range mage/non-adc to udyr max bear stance lvl? :/\nno idea what we'd do with udyr to compensate doe :/\n\n~~Kappa~~","replies":[{"poster":"HateDaddy","date":"2014-12-30T02:48:45.146+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheKingDodo,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NFZRGTTl,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2014-12-30T02:36:05.185+0000)\n>\n> Just increase MS of all non-dash champs/non-long range mage/non-adc to udyr max bear stance lvl? :/\n> no idea what we'd do with udyr to compensate doe :/\n> \n> ~~Kappa~~\n\nWell there's honestly no reason for champions like Lee Sin and Riven to have 350 MS but me saying this will just have the Lee Sin fanboys downvote spam me, which they all do honestly.

It's an approach that lets champions keep their strengths but enchances their weaknesses. For immobile champions, typically their immobility is their weakness. So when you enhance that weakness further, it does more damage to them than it would ever do to a mobile champion because aside from Kassadin, Riot almost never tones down mobility on a champion. Which could be good, it could be bad but perhaps they should really be careful with these nerfs to immobile champions and look for other ways to not punish them for being immobile. I highly doubt that will ever happen though.","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2014-12-30T04:06:10.722+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"I totally agree, except Riot is always so timid about actually nerfing those mobile champions at all (see Lucian's range nerf alongside a massive mobility buff, but in Riot's eyes, an overall nerf). mobility should come at the cost of damage, survivability, or CC.

Aside from 1v1 situations, how much does that really help him? It's more the just giving immobiles something, at this point you'd have to overload them with everything and immobile champions usually have a unique feature or strength and that would just make them absurd.","replies":[{"poster":"Baron of Bread","date":"2014-12-30T02:28:00.058+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really don't want to see the no mobility guys getting cc since I like the feel of Morde (being \"I can't run, so I will just have to kill you\").

Not necessarily built into abilities, just (for example) bumping Morde from a 340 to a 350 and taking some of the extra mobile champions like Lee Sin from 350 to 340.

Sion has a lot of CC and his ult is a mobility tool, I'd say new sion is fantastic design.  Annie is only strong because of range and absurd burst and CC. I wouldn't consider Karthus that strong, definitely not weak. But he has a global ult and does a shit on of both aoe damage and ranged single target damage. Malzahar sucks outside of lane. Swain, like Karthus, looks to get in the middle of a team with powerful aoe and single target damage. All of it aside from his ult is ranged. Xerath is ranged, all of his abilities are ranged. Are you not seeing a pattern here? Immobile range and being strong doesn't mean immobile melees are strong. I looked hard, and all of your \"immobile strong champions\" are ranged aside from 3, 2 of which aren't exactly what I'd consider immobile and one of them was a terrible example.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Yfrappefort","date":"2014-12-31T03:25:44.029+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.

You don't get to have true fun with mage champs anymore because assassins that don't even have to rely on having movement speed because they have a dash, leap, blink, etc. and can close that gap without buying tier 2 boots, and can kill you quickly because they opted for damage instead of those boots, because they can. The META has become a lot less reliant on movement speed, and a lot more reliant on whether you have a dash or not. The last immobile champ that was released was Vel'Koz. Vel'koz has a good amount of slows and a decent knockup. Though soft cc is increasingly becoming less and less reliable, as movement speed is becoming less and less impactful. With the release of champions like Rek'Sai, slows have become almost useless for champs that have to peel. Peeling has become hard cc or no cc. Slows in general have suffered from many champ releases. Rek'Sai can easily escape or kill all squishies if all the champ has to offer is a slow. For instance Volibear, Skarner if his ultimate is down, and many other champions especially including many of the mages that rely on slows.

Hexdrinker/maw is good, trinity is not a bruiser item, it's an item that caters to every class. Black cleaver isn't a bruiser item, it's an item that caters to every AD class. Ghostblade, which WAS a bruiser item got specifically buffed for ADCs. Still, it's become an item good on all AD classes.\n\nI'll name bruiser items that you can look at and think it offers what a bruiser wants: durability, damage and a passive that benefits them.\n\nFrozen Mallet: garbage. Overpriced, terrible build path\nWits end: garbage, overpriced and terrible build path\nArams: garbage. Removed.\nHexdrinker/maw: one of a few only good items you could consider for bruisers \nHydra: melee item, awesome and honestly overpowered as shit on people who can use it well, but it's the only good true melee item.\nIceborn Guantlet: it's better on ranged champions than it is melee champions\n\nSo what's your point? Offensive bruiser items suck. Defensive items aren't great, especially MR itemization for tanks. Righteous Glory is amazing but it's pure health and random regen which barely does anything for team fights. And the items you claim are \"bruiser items\" like trinity and blade have been nerfed because of ranged adcs, not bruisers. And something else to consider here, if adc itemization is such shit, explain how they are still the best class?
