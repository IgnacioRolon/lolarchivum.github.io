However, I actually find her to be more tolerable when she’s strong than other ADCs like Cait, Jinx, Kog, etc. Longer ranged carries that can just stand behind their teams and melt you just as rapidly as vayne but from a safer distance are much more frustrating. I realize I just said Kog and that’ll be unpopular around here because he’s immobile, but he more than makes up for it with his W and playing with a brain because it’s so easy to peel now - just auto attack and stand by your front line.\r\n\r\nVayne, on the other hand, can’t actually do that. She has to get very close and then kite and engage in a series of kiting and chasing, so often times she can’t even focus the same target for a long period of time because she’ll stay too close and die. So this makes her incredibly suspectible to mages, because they often-times our range her and burst her in fights (ask a Vayne player about how much they hate ryze/Annie/Sandra/Lissandra). \r\n\r\nAgain, I absolutely think vayne is too good right now - they could definitely stand to reduce her stealth duration. But I actually find her to be one of the more interactive and engaging ADCs that has a more unique play style. Sure it’s point and click, but at least she has to get very close. Very few “hyper” carries have this risk. But people hear %hp true damage and lose their minds (not that I disagree that the concept is dumb) and lose logical thought patterns. \r\n\r\nBeing honest, I’d much rather have a longer ranged ADC late game than have vayne because her siege is weak; her pushing power lacks; and her teamfight is super comp dependent (and when you consider these things, that’s probably a clear indicator that she’s overperforming right now since those things don’t seem to matter). In short, Vayne’s design does not really bother me much.

If she wants to proc them, she will. \n\n Garen’s passive also punishes people for doing well so they can’t technically outplay it. \n\n> those champions who arent, are among the most complained about when theyre strong, like jax or tryndamere, or pantheon.\n\nThey are still melee and prone to being kited out and peeled, that’s the design behind their counter play.

Just because? And it’s not “just tacked on,” it costs her one of her spells and she has to proc it. Shorter ranged champions like who? Graves? He has a huge defensive steroid. Vayne has no way to extend her range past 550 for damaging purposes. That’s it. And as such, she’s incredibly prone to being bursted. The reality is, you hate her because she beats melee champions straight up. That’s really what this is about honestly. But you’re ignoring the fact that she gets destroyed by assassins and mages.\n\n> the only possible mechanic to outplay is the stun on her e. the problem is that the same stun is attached to a direct target displacement that already tends to win her fights against almost every melee champion in the game.\n\nIt wins her fights vs melee champions, not ranged champions. You aren’t being logical, you are just a melee player making your claims based on your biases. \n\n> marksmen just get shit slapped on for free, and their kits are designed entirely without counterplay in mind. everything they have is 100% reliable. this is the problem with that whole class bar two or three exceptions.\n\nWhile that is technically true, they are still the easiest class in the game to burst. They are the epitome of glass cannon, so this naturally makes their design very binary. Is that good? Probably not but they are the only class that can consistently keep tanks in check. You can hate that all you want but this game has existed for 10 years and this has been riots balancing philosophy. \n\nIt’s very clear you’re simply anti-adc/melee biased and you shape your arguments around it. While you make decent points, they’re short-sighted and ignore the other side of the argument with no consideration of it. I play melee champions pretty strictly too but I try to be open-minded and understand that my biases can blind me. And this is the case with vayne, she actually has several weaknesses but when she kills you, it’s easy to see your death recap and scream about her %hp damage. But then you realize she gets stomped in most lanes (normally), that she can’t extend this short range (her stealth is too long atm tho), and she has no defensive steroids at all. She is the most prone ADC to being bursted down in an instant so her style of right clicking demands that she play with some give and take. I would take that sort of design any day over champions melting me from long range with little I can do to hope to break through a front line to get them.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2019-03-17T15:33:51.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HateDaddy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ilwFjvhk,comment-id=00050001000000000000,timestamp=2019-03-16T01:03:08.146+0000)\n>\n> Yes you are \n> \n> Fiora’s Q prioritizes vitals so you often have to walk away and reset or beat you can do is stand by a wall, and even then there’s really no outplay potential.

Just because? \n\ni literally already typed it out. % true damage doesnt have counterplay in itemization, but these mechanics are altering their gameplay, they have direct strategic (keep garen off that single marked target) or mechanical counterplay (position to deny vitals) for their opponents. theyre not reliable, and are outplayable independent of the champion youre playing yourself.\n\nvaynes w doesnt alter her playstile or makes her aim for a special win condition to access the damage, that her opponent can deny her. if you removed the w entirely from her kit, she would be weaker but play exactly the same as she does right now. she would just auto attack the closest target that she can safely auto attack and switch targets if neccessary.\n\n> And it’s not “just tacked on,” it costs her one of her spells and she has to proc it. \n\nits a passive, it doesnt cost her shit. its just unconditional power where other champions have conditional or unreliable power. be it something as simple as a skillshot.\n\n> Shorter ranged champions like who?

However, I actually find her to be more tolerable when she’s strong than other ADCs like Cait, Jinx, Kog, etc. Longer ranged carries that can just stand behind their teams and melt you just as rapidly as vayne but from a safer distance are much more frustrating. I realize I just said Kog and that’ll be unpopular around here because he’s immobile, but he more than makes up for it with his W and playing with a brain because it’s so easy to peel now - just auto attack and stand by your front line.\n> \n> Vayne, on the other hand, can’t actually do that. She has to get very close and then kite and engage in a series of kiting and chasing, so often times she can’t even focus the same target for a long period of time because she’ll stay too close and die. So this makes her incredibly suspectible to mages, because they often-times our range her and burst her in fights (ask a Vayne player about how much they hate ryze/Annie/Sandra/Lissandra). \n> \n> Again, I absolutely think vayne is too good right now - they could definitely stand to reduce her stealth duration. But I actually find her to be one of the more interactive and engaging ADCs that has a more unique play style. Sure it’s point and click, but at least she has to get very close. Very few “hyper” carries have this risk. But people hear %hp true damage and lose their minds (not that I disagree that the concept is dumb) and lose logical thought patterns. \n> \n> Being honest, I’d much rather have a longer ranged ADC late game than have vayne because her siege is weak; her pushing power lacks; and her teamfight is super comp dependent (and when you consider these things, that’s probably a clear indicator that she’s overperforming right now since those things don’t seem to matter).

She is a champ who HAS to look for an opening to deal any damage, and no one should be able to build a resistance that shuts down her damage because she honestly doesn't have alot of up time on her auto attacking unless she's got a perfect team comp. But she's generally a weaker pick for all the reasons you say, it's why she's never been and never will be the highest win rate adc, but she'll go through phases where people think she's \"meta\". I dread getting a vayne on my team, anything short of a good vayne is really difficult to carry. VS a jinx, kog, ashe, trist, w/e can get in damage from a distance that makes it much easier to keep them alive. And therefore increases their chance of still being alive to clean up by end of the teamfight and help get objectives.\n\nBTW for those of you who don't know vayne has been sitting around a 51ish % w/r, which is to high for a niche adc.
