Sorc obviously offers none. \n\nSo we have the 40%/+30\n\nAt 140 AP, I think it's obvious having the pen is better at ALL MRs so lets ignore that.\n\n>FYI MR/ARM is calculated by \nResist/(Resist+100)\nSo for 100 MR 50/50+100 = 33% \n\nIf the pen items are all a person has then. \n\n>Resist  -(void) -flat = damage done \n\n50 MR  -(20) -30 = 140 damage, True damage \n100 MR  -(40)-30 = 107.7 damage\n200 MR  -(80)-30  = 73\n\nLets start low at 200 AP (No pen)\n50 MR = 200-33% = 133\n100 MR =  200-50% = 100\n200 MR = 200-66%  = 67\n\nSo at 200 AP you are less effective than a full pen build at all times despite having less AP. \n\nThe break point however is not far.\nAt 225 AP we are already more effective than a full pen build. \n50 MR = 225-33% = 151\n100 MR =  225-50% = 112.5\n200 MR = 225-66%  = 76.5\n\nWhile 225 does instantly surpass a full pen build, the only factors to truly consider are cost/AP ratios. If your AP ratios are lower than 100% combined on a rotation than you must have even more AP than this to break even. (and get that juicy +3.5 damage on a target with 200 MR) \nCost will bite you though, Sorc immediately make it to where getting three other items is just worse. \n\nAnd then getting a Rabs or something AP heavy on the pen build makes the numbers skew heavily to the pen build. \n\nLets do that in the 225 AP vs 140 AP +Pen and add Rabs.\n\n140AP+ Rabs = 364 (PEN)\n50 MR  -(20) -30 = 364 damage, True damage \n100 MR  -(40)-30 = 280 damage\n200 MR  -(80)-30  = 191.57\n\n225AP+ Rabs = 483\n50 MR = 483-33% = 323.6\n100 MR =  483-50% = 241.5\n200 MR = 483-66%  = 164.22\n\n\nSo in general while you may get +11 damage on a 3 item full ap build against pen at 225 AP. It's probably still better to get void since afterwards the Pen build still wins vs AP even despite having 120 more at ~4 items worth of AP at all stages.\n\nThis is by no means law for every game, a 50 MR target is most effectively taken care of with 2 flat items and a bunch of AP. I was just putting them against each other with out crossing. It would get way to complicated.
