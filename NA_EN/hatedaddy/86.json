You only really feel it if you take a lot of poke though, due to her lack of sustain. Zyra's threat range is much larger than Sona's however and proper positioning is key to performing well on her.\n\nTo the topic at hand, Sona doesn't need any buffs as it stands. I've seen a couple players complaining about her lack of damage and powerful heals but that's not what the current Sona is about. Probably the strongest parts about her kit are the small shield and movement speed she can grant every 6 and 7 seconds late game respectively (with proper CDR). Sona is a teamfight-skirmish champion; the longer the fight goes on the more effective she becomes.\n\nEven at 0 AP, a 110 HP heal + 115 shield + 1.5 sec, 14% speed boost every 7 seconds is incredibly useful. That's before you even take into account her potential damage-reduction/slow passive and ultimate. That she can provide the bonuses to all four allies at once at no additional mana cost is huge.\n\nWhat Sona lacks in numbers she makes up for with overwhelming utility. She's not the easiest support to play, especially in this targeted-CC-infested meta. Her aura bubble is very small, demanding correct positioning for both offense and safety, and due to the short duration of the shield and speed boost, proper timing of her skills is critical. She's not a mindless spam champ, she fills a jack-of-all niche that most other supports in the game can't really compete with.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Haunt","date":"2015-07-17T23:12:40.211+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NERDSMASHER5000,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Xg6wxAMB,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-07-17T23:10:42.851+0000)\n>\n> I completely agree.

The rework was a complete disaster. It nerfed her sustained damage, nerfed her damage to towers, nerfed her burst and made it too dependent on other team members, homogenized her W and gave it an internal conflict (high health or low health? Lose half of the ability or risk an all-in with the shortest shield in the world?), reduced the team-helping capability of her E (it's basically just an extra pair of activated boots for her), reduced her zone of influence by over 80%, destroyed the beautiful symmetry of her cooldowns, and flat-out disrespected her character. It didn't even resolve most of the problems they were trying to address! Not to mention that the way the rework was handled was just disgusting: 3 months of silence at a time punctuated by the occasional dismissive comment. I hope Fearless never touches another champion again.\n\nThe issue isn't her power. It's pretty easy to argue that Sona is powerful. **The issue is design**. Riot destroyed one of the only two stance-based characters in the game and made her less fun to play (and for no real reason). As it is, she still pokes, still sustains, still moves fast, and still ults. Nothing new there. But now she's mostly worse at all of those things. And with ever-growing mobility creep and more versatile champions continually entering the game, she doesn't have the tools to compete. \n\nShould she be as bloated as Lee Sin? No. But look at the new Gangplank rework, or at Tam, or even Braum! They all have interactive playstyles which have obvious and tangible effects on the game. Chained powder keg slows/damage, or transporting allies/engulfing enemies, or stopping almost every projectile in the game every 18 seconds! Hell, every other support has some sort of non-ultimate peel (even the dedicated healer!), whether it's a silence, a slow, a stun, a hook, whatever. But Sona is way too reliant on her only \"play-maker\" (ugh..), her ult. She needs a silence, or a stun, or...something! Yes, she has her W and E powerchords, but those are rather weak these days and don't truly peel; they are also unreliable since Riot slaughtered her cooldowns. \n\n(**Fun Fact: **Riot wanted to know why Q-powerchord use has gone up while the others have gone down, and they were suggesting nerfing her Q-powerchord even more to \"correct\" this issue. Their Sona nerfs are literally leading to more Sona nerfs! That's insane!)\n\nI get that the majority of people don't want to buff a \"strong\" champion, but the rework didn't make her strong. It actually made her a lot weaker. It just put her into the spotlight and encouraged people who had little-to-no experience with her to see her strength for the first time and then call for nerfs. Worse still, the rework removed many of her niche abilities (speeding up minions, helping siege towers), made her **HARDER** to balance (do you balance her Q damage around just her using it, her entire team using it, or somewhere in-between?), made her gameplay more binary (dominate in lane or lose it), made her stupidly dependent on her team (I get that not every champion should be an amazing duelist but, even with the advantage, she's probably gonna lose against almost anyone in an extended trade), **gutted her most defining feature (auras)**, and gave her mains/fans one of the biggest slaps in the face since MTG's 2013 Emmara Tandris debacle.\n\nSona either needs to go back to how she was (unlikely) or receive a real rework to put her on par with today's roster. The one she received in 2014 was a sick joke, a huge nerf in disguise stemming from ignorance and carelessness. It looks more like someone just gave up 1/4 of the way through and tried to put her back together mostly how she was, but worse. She still has a ton of invisible power, but instead of being literally invisible now (the added colour effects changed that) it's tied even more into what her team does. Old Sona had a passive design and her playstyle was flexible. New Sona's design is **still passive**, but appears active because she has to \"_move around more_\" to buff her teammates, and it's also less flexible now. She should be reworked to encourage a truly active playstyle instead of the faux-active one she has now.\n\nObviously, many are going to disagree with me for countless reasons (my rank, my skill, the fact that I haven't made a MOBA, insert your fallacy here), but I would argue that most people with considerable experience with her before the rework will generally agree that she needs to be rescued from her current state, and I would ask them to speak up. Once again, it's not her power that's the main issue, it's her terrible design.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Norscout","date":"2015-07-18T01:43:49.802+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"lol @ people thinking this is satire.

They didn't actually adjust her kit in any way to make it easier to balance her. They actually made her **more difficult to balance** and nerfed her at the same time! \n\nThe rework literally added one new component to her kit: a shield. Everything else is, functionally, identical to her old kit, but generally with lower numbers. Yes, Q gives an on-hit buff instead of an AD increase, but it's still just damage for your teammates. Only now, the damage ratio for Q is MORE dependent on your allies using it (and it can't hit towers and it doesn't benefit AD champs as much). W also gives a stronger heal when the targets are at lower health, but then the heal numbers were nerfed anyways, so it's not as strong in comparison to her old heal as the ability would suggest.\n\nTheoretically, she's stronger because she can \"hit 4 teammates\" but... **she could do that before**. The area of her auras were cut by over 80% to \"_justify increasing the strength of her individual abilities_\" but... her abilities didn't really get stronger. Certainly not strong enough to justify an 80%+ area cut. Some have even been weakened!\n\nFurther, the impacts of these nerfs wasn't fully considered: her passive's uptime has been cut substantially because of her cooldown changes, which leads to her having less access to it's unique effects (especially for W and E).

She has literally everything pretty much. She has damage, movement speed buffs, heals, slows, can lower the enemy's damage, a stun, shields. She can do incredibly well in bot lane and incredibly well in mid lane. Not one of her abilities alone is extremely strong aside from her ultimate, which is game-changing and it can win games alone but she uses her entire kit to make her someone you really have to keep in your mind. As a support she can definitely keep a team in the fight, engage, disengage, and is overall able to fit in most team comps properly especially with ADCs like Ezreal and Miss Fortune who she synergizes EXTREMELY well with. As a mid laner, she has the potential to one-shot someone (I've personally one shot a lot of people when I use to main Sona Mid/Support) and doesn't need much besides a Lich Bane, she has insanely strong heals, and her burst is something new to the game that rarely any Supports besides maybe Karma can ever bring into mid lane.\n\n**_For Buffs_**\nSona is extremely mana hungry and really, it prevents her early game from being how good it could be. She's squishy and immobile, and she actually was a pretty good mid laner before her nerfs. It wasn't that hard to poke someone down and force them to either be denied farm/exp, recall, or die. The nerfs to her were pretty unfair, and definitely made her damage much lower. While she definitely wasn't forced into the Support role, it made it seem like they didn't want her to be succesful elsewhere. She has plenty of room for counterplay, and her early game was hit fairly hard where she is suppose to excel and where she is suppose to be a god in lane. Lowering her heals, lowering her movement speed, lowering her damage multiple times. She could use a buff to her mana, or just lower the costs of her damage and healing spells.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PenguinOverlord8","date":"2015-07-19T17:27:07.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually kind of like sona how she is right now. Her poke early game is great.

Her late game is extremely strong (if you get good CS and kills early on), but her early game is just extremely weak. I am not saying her damage should be buffed, but maybe some mana costs lowered or a strengthened shield with her heal, etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2015-07-19T04:56:09.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stop begging for upvotes.

She has an absorb for the entire team around her + heals the 2 lowest hp champs. Her E is a sprint for the entire team around her, pretty much sivir's ult. And an entire team stun. Her Q + power chord also hits incredibly hard, especially if she picks up Lich Bane later. Just because a champ isn't in the meta doesn't necessarily make them bad. Sona acts as an incredible support later on, and unlike other healing supports she doesn't really have to choose who she wants to save.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SociopathFriend","date":"2015-07-18T16:34:15.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I came ready and willing to read about proposed Sona buffs... and then it's literally just a thread saying \"Buff my champ\".
