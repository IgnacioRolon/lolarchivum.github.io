I decided to take a little break and grab some iced tea to drink when all of a sudden I hear a loud \"HYAAAA.\" Following this noise, i notice an almost translucent sphere flying at me right away and I use my rake to block it, knocking the rake out of my hands into a pile of leaves. I look up to see Lee Sin attempting to stare at me but failing miserabley.\r\n\r\nIf this wasn't crazy enough, I hear a streetsweeper coming down the street and notice somebody on top of it screaming and reciting the song \"I'M WALKING ON SUNSHINE OHHH OH\" while standing on it with the George Washington pose crossing the Delaware. The person jumps off right away and I notice it's Jatt. Rivington rode his bike and follows Jatt while looking at me with a cautious look, as if hes saying \"here we go again...\"\r\n\r\nLee Sin finally gathers himself and realizes I am in front of him and I pick the rake up and throw it at his sausage shaped head. He suddenly grabs a long branch from the yard and throws it away from the flying rake and jumps to it. I hear a loud screech from behind me and look over to see Jatt simply losing his shit. He begins to literally rip his shoe strings from his own shoes with his teeth while yelling \"OMFG LCS BIG PLAYS, lCS BRANCH JUMPS LCS LEE SIN.\" Then he picks up the rake and in a display of raw LCS emotion and excitement, he smacks rivington in the back of the head with it, knocking him out into a pile of leaves. Then Jatt jumps in the air and elbow drops rivington yelling \"LCS ELBOW DROPS\" with leaves and Jatts spit flying everywhere.\r\n\r\nAnnoyed by this, I grab the flame thrower i keep stashed in my yard under a fake pile of leaves an point it at Lee Sin. Suddenly Lee flashes and used his dragon rage kick to kick it out of my hands, into jatts hands. I am pissed at this point so I smash the glass of iced tea over Lee Sausges head and he begins to run. Suddenly the streetsweeper comes back and he Qs it and jumps to it, even getting run over by it but he survives by using his OP shield and hangs on for dear life as the streetsweeper takes him away to safety.\r\n\r\nIncredibly annoyed, I realize Jatt is still in my yard so I turn around and slowly walk towards him with an aggressive posture. Jatt slowly walks backwards, finally bumping into a tree where he notices a gallon of gasoline is sitting there on the ground. He picks it up, drenches himself in it and looks at me and says \"WAKA WAKA\" and grabs the flamethrower and uses it on himself, causing an explosion and firing him into the sky as a giant jatt fireball and he yells \"LOOKS LIKE TEAM JATT IS BLASTING OFF AGAIN!!\" Then he simply flies out of my sight but twinkles like a star right before doing so.\r\n\r\nThe police come by and ask what happened and I explained what Lee Sin did and before I could finish they said \"yeah they need to nerf that shit.\" Rivington wakes up and says shakes the cobwebs and looks around with a dazed look then suddenly comes to and mutters \"god dammit Jatt.\" He gets on his bike and rides off into the sunset calling his lawyer saying they need to fire jatts ass.\r\n\r\nTl;dr nerf Lee Sin and tell Jatt to stop trying to steal my pikachu","replies":[]}
