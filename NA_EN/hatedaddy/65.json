BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, UNDERSTAND UR NOT ALWAYS FORCED TO BUILD THESE 3 GANGSTER ASS ITEMS RIGHT AWAY. UNDERSTAND THE FLOW OF THE GAME AND IF UR DOING WELL, U MIGHT BE SAFE ENOUGH TO BUILD DAMAGE AND RUN THE ENTIRE BLOCK, OTHERWISE MAKE SURE U ARE BUILDING HEALTH BECAUSE AFTER ALL, ARMOR IS NICE BUT IF U AINT GOT NO HEALTH, U DONT LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO RUN YOUR BLOCK.\r\n\r\nTHIS SHIT IS BROKEN: {{item:3047}} \r\n\r\nEVERYONE IS SCARED IF A NINJA GANGSTER AND IF U GET THESE, U GET IMMEDIATE RESPECT IN UR HOOD\r\n\r\nSOMETIMES U MIGHT BE ABLE TO RUSH TO THE ICE CREAM TRUCK AND BUY THESE\r\n\r\n{{item:3025}} BLUE BRASS KNUCKLES\r\n{{item:3110}} BLUEBERRY SLUSHY \r\n\r\nREMEMBER U DONT ALWAYS GET THESE THO CUZ U MIGHT NEED HP MORE BUT SOME CHAMPIONS LIKE {{champion:75}} WANT THE CRIPDOWN REDUCTION.

SO JUST WATCH UR BACK AND UNDERSTAND THIS IS UR SET \r\n\r\nTO BREAK DOWN WHAT YOU SHOULD BE STRAPPED WITH, HERES WHAT U CAN LOOK LIKE\r\n\r\nHeavy physical damage enemy team:\r\n{{item:3047}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3143}} SHOULD BE YOUR CORE\r\n\r\nConsider: {{item:3742}} for a good mixture of hp armor \r\n\r\nThis opens up the possibility to build damage items or other armor items that give no hp but other benefits like frozen hearts CDR and AS Slow aura. \r\n\r\nMixed damage team:\r\n\r\nagain, {{item:3143}} and {{item:3068}} are likely your core armor items and if they have heavy crit, consider getting randuins first, especially if laning vs a crit champion or if the enemy crit champion is snowballing. Otherwise, try to go for sunfire first because bamis cinder gives you so much lane presence. \r\n\r\nTypically you&#039;ll build {{item:3065}} and/or {{item:3102}} \r\n\r\nWhen to consider {{item:3065} or {{item:3102}} : if you have innate healing, need more HP than MR or at least a decent mixture and if you really value 10% CDR. If you don&#039;t value 10% CDR that much, consider {{item:3102}} especially if you&#039;re going to be getting HP from other items because the MR values it gives and it&#039;s build path are disgustingly good for mitigating magic damage.\r\n\r\nIf one MR item isn&#039;t enough then get both, but typically it will be unless they have sustained AP damage dealers like {{champion:13}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:8}} etc. And honestly, {{item:3190}} isn&#039;t bad as a second or even 3rd MR options even if an ally is getting it because the auras stack on the champions who hold the lockets:\r\n\r\nWhat to build if the enemy is heavy AP:\r\n\r\n{{item:3065}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3190}} {{item:3111}} \r\n\r\nPick 3 of the 4 and build them. As a tank, I really don&#039;t consider {{item:3111}} very often unless I plan on doing nothing but diving backlines because {{item:3047}} are so damn good against ADCs. \r\n\r\nYou can consider magic damage oriented MR items like {{item:3001}} and likely want to consider {{item:3060}} if you have AP ratios (as a tank you generally do) because this is so good at fucking over AP heavy comps and their wave clear. \r\n\r\nSO NOW U READ THIS SHIT N U A PRO TANKSTER\r\n\r\nREP UR HOOD AND STAY BLESSED YALL IM OUT","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2016-08-31T02:36:21.926+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":0,"body":"Instructions unclear.
