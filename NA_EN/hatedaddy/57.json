His kit isn’t really all that bad - just basic and generic, dated. He has nothing on the new bruiser kits, just stats. And at this point he’s spent more time being trash than viable while not ever really truly being “weak.” The fact is, he’s a hard scaling champion with tools that allow him to fight, but at a limited amount. In other words, he’s a noob stomper. Now, naturally with recent item and keystone additions, that’s less true. And that’s why he never needed a buff, and it’s why he was fine before until he got SoS.","replies":[{"poster":"Romans VI XXIII","date":"2019-08-28T15:53:27.934+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL\n\n> but that’s mostly a low elo sentiment\n\nJax is sitting at a 51+% across all Elos and all regions.\n\nThen when you look at Masters+ it goes UP to 53.5%\n\nHe also has pretty decent Ban/Pick rates as well across all elos.","replies":[{"poster":"Acrilyk3","date":"2019-08-29T08:59:25.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Romans VI XXIII,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xFnuYUN8,comment-id=00030000000000010000,timestamp=2019-08-28T15:53:27.934+0000)\n>\n> LOL\n> \n> Jax is sitting at a 51+% across all Elos and all regions.\n> \n> Then when you look at Masters+ it goes UP to 53.5%\n> \n> He also has pretty decent Ban/Pick rates as well across all elos.\n\nWrong. Since the Q buff, and because of the fact that Jax players can max E now, they have consistently had an easier laning phase. With that being said, to assume that he was broken before the buffs is simply delusional. He's been hovering between 49 percent and 51 percent winrate according to u.gg. Meanwhile Riven sits at 53-55% winrate in Masters+ and nobody complains about her? With that pickrate? Most of you are simply delusional and unable to handle numbers, like stop getting emotional and look at the facts. Goddamn Kai'Sa having 30% pickrate and we're complaining about Jax omegalul.","replies":[{"poster":"Romans VI XXIII","date":"2019-08-29T12:47:04.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Lmao.\n\n1. 1 broken champ does not excuse another.\n\n2.

If Jax, a late-game oriented character that has niche counters since you dont find Tryndamere players or adc toplane often doesn't get to be reasonably good, why should Riven? Kennen? Jayce? Most mages ffs cause they have Zhonya's Hourglass. You are not getting paid to balance their game for a reason. Most of us are too emotional, stupid, or are in \"a conflict of interest\" when we give balancing decisions. TFBlade mains toplane carries and that's why he's one of the best toplaners in the game (not sure if he's still number 1): he doesn't play tanks and consistently wins lanes &amp; games with snowbally characters. He is a noobstomper cause people fight him alone in the lategame. Yes, he became overbearing with Spear of Shojin, but I believe the nerfs to Conqueror were more than enough to put him in place.","replies":[{"poster":"Romans VI XXIII","date":"2019-08-29T19:03:39.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is a list of bad match ups for the Jax player\n\nList:\n\nJax has WAY to much going for him, and NO weakness.","replies":[{"poster":"Teorah","date":"2019-08-29T19:07:38.018+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Romans VI XXIII,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xFnuYUN8,comment-id=000300000000000100000001000000000000,timestamp=2019-08-29T19:03:39.970+0000)\n>\n> Here is a list of bad match ups for the Jax player\n> \n> List:\n> \n> Jax has WAY to much going for him, and NO weakness.\n\nSo, let me just give you my 2 cents buddy\nKennen a ranged bully with an escape and costs nothing because hes a energy user\nJayce , he has a lot of damage and poke you with his basic gate q combo and melee form has a knockback which gets you out of counterstrike range","replies":[{"poster":"Romans VI XXIII","date":"2019-08-29T19:11:14.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cool, and neither one of them are an issue for Jax lol.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Acrilyk3","date":"2019-08-29T19:45:26.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Romans VI XXIII,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xFnuYUN8,comment-id=000300000000000100000001000000000000,timestamp=2019-08-29T19:03:39.970+0000)\n>\n> Here is a list of bad match ups for the Jax player\n> \n> List:\n> \n> Jax has WAY to much going for him, and NO weakness.\n\nKennen, Jayce, Cassiopeia, Swain, Tryndamere earlygame, Riven, Renekton(sometimes), Fiora (idk if she still is with the counter strike parry interaction fixed).
