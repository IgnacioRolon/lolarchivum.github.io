Overall worthless. Trick2g is a funny talking mother fucker too. His fanboys are worse.\r\n\r\nPulse Fire Ezreal: always builds blue Ez, never lands Qs. Rushes ice born gauntlet, essence reaver then randomly completes tear. Almost always does the least amount of damage of any one on both teams but dies once and has 2 kills and goes \"noobs, shut up and let me carry.\" You'll be carrying me straight to the fountain when I see you with this skin, because that's where I'm going and im not coming back. \r\n\r\nInfernal Nasus: wannabe sircheez dudes. He's another funny talking mother fucker - what are you, brain damaged? Ermehgerd, mer stercks. Hey let's build stacking items so we can stack on our stacks and stack our stacks. 0/16 later, you can catch me stacking in the fountain you trash ass.\r\n\r\nAny Lee Sin Skin: because I hate you. Play something else.\r\n\r\nThat free Alistar Skin, the chained one: yeah. You're the guy who always fucks up your w/q combo and boots them away to safety. Not happening to me, you can feel free to heal me in the fountain though noob.\r\n\r\nAny ahri skin unless you're rock: I hate your kind. Unless you're rock. See ya in the fountain.\r\n\r\nBattle bunny Riven: I hate all riven players, unless you're maximum riven. \"Muh hp regen nerf.\" Don't worry toots, my hp regen will be plenty fine in the fountain.","replies":[]}
