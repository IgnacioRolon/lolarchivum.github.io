Her one weakness is lack of mobility, this is made up for by long range with the potential to stun someone from 1000 range. \r\n\r\nHere is what we have:\r\n\r\n1. Lane bully: check\r\n2. Scales well: check\r\n3. Burst: check\r\n4. Disruption: check\r\n5. Waveclear: check\r\n\r\nShe bullies several lanes, she's actually got very few difficult match-ups.\r\n\r\nHer burst gives her incredible scaling, her stun is game changing. \r\n\r\nHer wave clear is fucking r%%%%%ed, she shouldn't have the best of every world. She also has pretty forgiving mana costs with high base damages and one of the highest potential burst combos in the game. As I noted, her one weakness is lack of mobility but that's not a huge weakness with her range and the ability to fend off ganks with her stun. She is a bit difficult to play and skill-shot reliant, but her skill shots aren't even what breaks her. It's by in large her mana costs, base damages and wave clear tied into all of that.\r\n\r\nSo when can we expect Syndra nerfs?\r\n\r\nI expect Redditors to downvote this and thats okay because they're not really people so I'm not offended.","replies":[]}
