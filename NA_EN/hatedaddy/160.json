This doesn&#039;t apply to Vlad but he&#039;s all about positioning and paying attention to enemy cooldowns since he basically fights as a melee in teamfights.\r\n\r\nMages basically just spam AoE whenever and it&#039;s never bad. They have low risk/high reward skill shots that change the game complety upon landing one of these extremely easy to use abilities. Their combo patterns are extremely easy, long ranged and safe and pretty idiot proof. They have itemization that can literally make it impossible for them to fuck up (lol 40% rylais aoe slow/zhonyas).\r\n\r\nAssassins take way more skill. They always have to consider positioning and pay attention to key enemy cooldowns. Their combos are typically much harder to pull off, are extremely high risk because if they fuck up or get interrupted they&#039;re dead. And they&#039;re melee champions in a lane dominated by ranged champions.\r\n\r\nADC is the hardest mechanical role in the game, mages don&#039;t even know how to orbwalk or auto attack for that matter. Just throw your keyboard at the wall for 200 CS at 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nBruisers take more skill because they play against a variety of champions from ranged lane bullies to melee bullies, play in a lane where they&#039;re actually gank able because they can&#039;t AFK clear from range under their tower, have to always consider their positioning in teamfights and consider if split pushing and flanking is better. Mages never have to make this decision, just get to teamfights and press R.\r\n\r\nTanks take more skill because they have to decide if their goal is to initiate a fight or peel back and pay attention to key cooldowns to protect their carries and use a plethora of different actives and use them at the most opportune time. Mages can just use zhonyas active when they fucked up, as if you could fuck up on a mage anyway. \r\n\r\nSupports require more skill because they actually have to know how to interact in lane and trade, with no items much less. Then their role changes from lane oriented bully/protecter or passive trader to vision control, which mages never have to worry about because they&#039;re always under tower since they can clear the minion wave in the middle of the lane for there. Supports also have to find ways to acquire gold outside of CS/Kills, something mages don&#039;t have to do because they throw their keyboards at the wall and have 200 CS by 20 minutes. Supports also have to peel, offer their utility in fights and often times die for their carries. Mages just press R and zhonyas active to outplay everything.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact of the matter is, mages are the easiest role in this game by far with literally no risk and extremely high reward. You don&#039;t even need mechanics to play mages, spam low risk low CD high reward spells, eventually land them and win the game. What&#039;s that? Your enemy laner out-traded you? Time to buy chalice and AFK wave clear from 1000+ range, never interact, get massively farmed and press R to win teamfights. Mage mains are the most delusional lot I&#039;ve ever seen.","replies":[]}
