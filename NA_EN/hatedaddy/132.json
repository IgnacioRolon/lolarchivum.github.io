This is like laning and valuing trades over CS.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2017-05-28T03:45:05.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yi mains in a nutshell LOL","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2017-05-27T22:53:10.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha nice try reasonable laner.
