The AS slow removal was a good thing but this doesn&#039;t change him at all, honestly.

If a high skill champion and a low skill champion both produce the same results, then what is the purpose of the high skill champion? Why take all the time to master them? Why even have them? In the end, high skill SHOULD produce higher results because of the higher effort needed.\n\nAnd your example is quite perfect. Despite Lee's high pick rate, people CAN'T master him easily.

It already provides massive benefits for four button presses, three of which involve targeted skills.

I mean numbers as in just raw power and a basic numerical advantage that requires no input. Things like movespeed or ratios fall into here. \n\nHigh pick rate means that lots of people, when forced to jungle, default into lee \"win\" and play miserably because they are inexperienced and lose. He has a ludicrous normal and very high ranked pick rate according to lolking in all ranks, which means that either raw power, personal preference, or \"because pros did it\" is attracting many players to pick lee.\n\nObviously, champs aren't mastered in 3-5 games, which is why many will lose with lee and drop him. It's not that they can't, but they don't have to or want to more often than not. However, as many have supposedly seen in LCS or other big tournaments, lee is a staple pick and incredibly powerful in the right hands who probably have played him hundreds of times if not more.

Mastering difficult champion is more rewarding, as he offers more options and ways to play than basic, binary champion.\n\nThis buff is contradicting. They want Lee to become stronger for those who have yet to get good with Lee, while Lee masters will abuse this free power with their \"awesome no-scope 360 flash-dash\" ults.\n\nTristana is pretty good example, as her ultimate is kind of similar to Lees'. Her R offers kind of less than Lees R and her stats are worse in every aspect (except cast range, as she's ranged). \n\nLee Sins kit has already quite alot of power here'n'there. &hp on Q, slow on W, shield + lifesteal on E, 2.0 AD scaling on R. I really don't believe he needs even more power.\n\nDaaah, it's super hard to explain what i'm trying to say :S\n\nPoint is, Lee Sins ultimate has already exceptional usefullnes, knockback, stun, high damage, awesome disengage on low cooldown. This buff will just make him \"press R on tank in general direction of squishes to win\". Yea squishy targets will survive, but it'll make them on the verge of dying. With just R. \n\n\nNow on Evelynn, yeah in Pro stages she might be good, but what about low level players? Her kit doesn't promote playing her as an assassin. Actually she has to build tankier that Malphite in most of the games.\nThat's the reason why I'm salty here. Riot had no idea how to deal with her, so they have removed most of her power and forced her to be frontline tank/bruiser.\n\nIf there are champions who are kind of difficult to play because of their kit, that require buffs it's Evelynn, Twitch & Elise. I do know that Elise recieved buffs, but that doesn't make her easier to play. She's still difficult to play and her whole combo has rather mediocre damage. So by that \"Lee Sin buff logic\", she should also recieve buffs so low level players could be more effective, right?","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Engine","date":"2015-08-13T21:36:08.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2015-08-14T01:56:04.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry i mean you no disrespect, but you wall of text if too owerwhelming for me.. I've just read few lines of text, hope you'll excause me (at least for now).\n\nMy point was: Lee was always good (maybe not lately). Riot gave him free damage on his already amazing ultimate. For free.\n\nAnd there are other champions who should be buffed instead of him. Not that they are useless/unviable/unplayable.. \n\nTrist example. I've made it because of 2 reasons:\n1. her ultimate is +/- similar. \n2. She recieved rework \"not that loong ago\".\n\nIn first case Tristanas ultimate is weaker in every aspect than Lees. I know it's meant to disengage or peel off pesky bruisers, but if that huge-ass cannon shot is meant to push back already tanky targets, then why it has such terrible base damage/scaling (that deals AP damage, I think)?\n\nAnd second, as champion gets reworked you expect that he'll be balanced. Pre-rework trist was strong, no doubt here. But AFTER rework she's very weak & fragile. Riot has removed her AP build,  yet they left her ultimate to how it's been in beta. \n\nLast thing: I used to be ARAM-only player. Which mea METAS weren't really effective against me. But truth be told I liked tank-meta. Am I fan of assassin meta? Not really... Reason why i mentioned Eve was cause i'm still really salty of her major rework which removed true stealth. I wasn't even Eve main back then, it's just... They gimped her into tank-bruiser with little-to-no assassin traits (and then they further nerfed her just to stop flood of angry kids threads who were too gredy to buy pink ward). Oh I also said about Elise.. Yeah now I see why you connected the dots as me = assassin-meta fan. Na na naah, I've mentioned her, because gameplay wise she's just as difficult as Lee, yet far less \"hurting\". You either build her as a tank and just spam stuns, or you build her as an assassin and be pretty much 1hit KO, no damage, dead weight for a team.\n\nTL;DR\nLee buffs don't follow logic of balancing, where there are other champions who require buffs more.

Late game tank junglers are still the gods of teamfights, that hasn't changed, nor will it ever. The only thing that has changed is they aren't buying cinderhulk and hitting their late game significantly faster, which was a bit absurd. They will still be fine.\n\nCompetitively speaking, I doubt devourer will ever be good because junglers in competitive play just don't get that kind of farm.","replies":[{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-08-08T03:07:03.524+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Shyvana is a Devourer jungler who has had use in competitive play.

But in general, tank junglers don't see much in competitive play because some of the harder scaling ones like Amumu are incredibly gold dependent. And in competitive play, junglers just don't get a lot of gold because they basically sacrifice everything they have to everyone else. As for solo queue, I agree, devourer is incredibly powerful at the moment on Shyv and Kayle. But cinderhulk will still be decent, they just toned down the retarded power spike tank junglers were getting when they completed it. \n\nTanks are still going to be good in this game, tank junglers will be decent still. But in competitive play, I wouldn't expect a supreme amount of diversity because of how starved junglers are and there isn't a large amount of champions who function well with low income in the jungle, tank and non tank junglers alike.","replies":[{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-08-08T15:35:19.051+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hai played Shyvana a few times recently. \n\nI just feel like the jungle cannot settle into diversity.
