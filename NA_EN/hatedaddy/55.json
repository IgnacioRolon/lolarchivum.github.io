No worries, it’ll be brief. \r\n\r\nFiddlesticks: \r\n\r\nIn reality, you have a good kit that probably just needs some QoL buffs that give him more consistency. He has one of the best ults in the game. At worst, he needs a small rework to reshuffle power in his kit but fiddle absolutely lives up to his character. \r\n\r\nVolibear: \r\n\r\nIf there was one champion that came close to Shyvana, it’s volibear. However, at least volibear is functional. He’s just bland and generic, and he really doesn’t have much of a feel character-wise. \r\n\r\nNocturne: \r\n\r\nThis champion just needs defensive stat buffs. A single spell shield on a diver used to be all you needed, but the game has changed. He has an amazing character and his kit has held up well over time. He just needs better scaling HP. That’s one place to start.\r\n\r\nDr Mundo:\r\n\r\nC’mon man, he’s everybody’s favorite beef stick that goes where he pleases. Seriously though, I don’t think there’s anything really wrong with Mundo save for his W. You could do a small rework on this spell, because it doesn’t offer much anymore as mundo doesn’t favor the jungle any longer. Other than that, mundo is mundo. \r\n\r\nNow let’s get onto Shyvana:\r\n\r\nPlease understand, I do not play Shyvana so I could absolutely be speaking out of term here. Then again, I almost never see Shyvana anymore and she’s a champion that used to be incredibly popular - so I have to assume she’s fallen out of favor for many of her mains. That said, I also know that the idea of riot reworking your main is terrifying but in riots defense, they’re usually pretty damn good with full scale updates. \r\n\r\nHere’s my issue with Shyvana: what does she do? What’s unique about her? Yes, these same questions apply to voli as I mentioned above, but he at least has some functionality. Furthermore he’s bland and generic, while Shyvana has a cool concept that is simply super disappointing. She doesn’t even feel like a “two-form” champion because going into dragon form isn’t really rewarding at all. A champion that functions similarly is Gnar in that he has to build up rage to transform (though he cannot control it). You know when mega Gnar is around, you feel his presence. Dragon form Shyvana? Eh....was that a cannon minion that just hit me? \r\n\r\nShyvana’s biggest problem is that you have made her so reliant on just being a stat stick. Back in season 3 and 4 when she was one of the best top laners, riot constantly nerfed her because she was a champion you couldn’t really kite while you couldn’t ignore either. That was the quintessential problem with bruisers back then: they filled multiple roles while being straight forward and bland, barely any depth at all. So their playstyle, naturally, was “run at them until one of us dies.” Ask yourself this: has that really changed with Shyvana? Not really. In fact, they’ve further reinforced that with her passive, which is one of the worst passives in the game: get stats for killing dragons. So she doesn’t even truly have control over the stats she can potentially get, making it even more mundane. \r\n\r\nListen, Shyvana has one of the coolest potentials in league. Dude, a god damn half dragon? There’s so much there that it hurts to even think about how basic she is. It hurts to see how utterly unfunctional she is, so much so that people find it better to build her as AP than her intended on-hit bruiser style - and in my experience, AP Shyv performs better (obviously I do not have stats to confirm or deny this so I admit this is entirely anecdotal). Nevertheless, a problem. And I honestly think when you consider all of this, Shyvana has to be the most disappointing champion in the league, especially when you consider how popular she was in s2, s3, and s4.","replies":[{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2019-05-10T16:11:53.366+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"I don't play Shyvana\" \n\nMight as well just stop there; you don't, you wont and you never will play Shyvana, so why pretend you want her improved other than to spite her player base?

It has nothing to do with me. The champion has had a exponential drop in a play rate, especially concerning for a champion that at one time had a huge playerbase. And are you really going to sit here and pretend Shyvana had a champion isn’t generic or uninteresting? That’s what many people are using to explain her playrate drop; that’s why she’s being suggested for a rework in the first place. And with your logic, champions shouldn’t be updated at all because the 5 people who play that champion would be upset as opposed to the millions that might play them and love them if they were actually given functional kits. \n\n I’m starting to think this is misdirected frustration because voli is on the slate to be changed and you don’t want that. But whether you like it or not, riot has a good track record on reworking champions full scale. And to their defense, they absolutely admit they fail too and look to address those as well.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"HateDaddy","date":"2019-05-10T16:16:00.339+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Moody P,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=P2iA81NO,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-05-10T16:11:53.366+0000)\n>\n> \"I don't play Shyvana\" \n> \n> Might as well just stop there; you don't, you wont and you never will play Shyvana, so why pretend you want her improved other than to spite her player base?

Granted, they can’t ult you from a screen away but the overall theme still holds true. And nocturne isn’t going to insta burst you either like Rengar or Talon, so even then you have an opportunity to get away. Moreover, you just said in your own statement what you have to do in order to nullify his ult. And as someone that has played quite a bit of nocturne, nothing is more frustrating than an ADC that stays with their team! But his ult still has good utility, split push potential and even objective potential. So I wouldn’t say it’s feast or famine either.","replies":[{"poster":"D357R0Y3R","date":"2019-05-10T19:07:16.528+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HateDaddy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=P2iA81NO,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2019-05-10T16:49:10.442+0000)\n>\n> Bro, how is that different than any other assassin?\n\nThe difference is that against an assassin (with the exception of Talon maybe) you can track the movement of any of them\nYou can know where zed is on the map, and as an adc that's important because it allows you to farm while avoiding them\n\nagainst nocturne it's impossible \n> Granted, they can’t ult you from a screen away but the overall theme still holds true. \n\nthat's  A HUGE DIFFERENCE \n\n>And nocturne isn’t going to insta burst you either like Rengar or Talon\n\nlol yes he can\nPlay against nocturne as Ashe and your point of view will change.\n\n>And as someone that has played quite a bit of nocturne, nothing is more frustrating than an ADC that stays with their team! \n\nin high elo unless the adc is busted af they pretty much need 3 items to come online, by comming online it means having the same impact than the mage in the midlane who can until then single handly win the teamfight.\n\nhow do you get items? you have no choice but to farm the sidelane and midlane\nadcs with supports get the midlane after laning phase while other roles shove the sidelanes and try to get picks\n\nif the enemy team has nocturne, then the adc is either paralyzed because he cannot move without getting bursted, or cannot commit to farm any lane at all.\n\nThere is a reason that atm on EUW the best junglers are nocturne players\n\nhttps://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=agurin","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2019-05-10T16:52:36.296+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HateDaddy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=P2iA81NO,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-05-10T16:02:57.663+0000)\n>\n> Now let’s get onto Shyvana:\n> \n> Please understand, I do not play Shyvana so I could absolutely be speaking out of term here. Then again, I almost never see Shyvana anymore and she’s a champion that used to be incredibly popular - so I have to assume she’s fallen out of favor for many of her mains. That said, I also know that the idea of riot reworking your main is terrifying but in riots defense, they’re usually pretty damn good with full scale updates. \n> \n> Here’s my issue with Shyvana: what does she do? What’s unique about her? \n\nThis is largely riot's fault and how they kept changing her kit and the jungle.  She used to be able to invade and duel pretty well.  You built the AS jungle item, then bruiser stuff.  Riot got rid of that ability and now she's an AFK farmer when riot doesn't like afk farmers, she can't invade, she can't duel, and they made it so AP mage shyvana is a thing thanks to all the tweaks.\n\nAnother thing I think that hurt her is league of mobility creep.  She used to be able to stick to targets.  Nowadays your only hope for that is either buying a frozen mallet or a trinity force.  Would you buy either of those items on Ahri, Lux, or Syndra?  It's like live balance put Shyvana's tweaks in the hands of a 2 headed Hellen Keller.\n\n\n> Shyvana’s biggest problem is that you have made her so reliant on just being a stat stick. Back in season 3 and 4 when she was one of the best top laners, riot constantly nerfed her because she was a champion you couldn’t really kite while you couldn’t ignore either. \n\nThis is something riot also has to consider if they want to rework her: is lane shyvana going to be a thing again or not.  \n\n>In fact, they’ve further reinforced that with her passive, which is one of the worst passives in the game: get stats for killing dragons. So she doesn’t even truly have control over the stats she can potentially get, making it even more mundane. \n\nIf riot was smart, her passive would act a lot more like Threshs: large jungle mobs have a chance to give her a stat buff for armor/mr. I tried suggesting that once, but it was downvoted like crazy.  Requiring a champ who can't really gank or 1v1 to take dragons is a risky proposition.  You have to do try and sneak it and the other guy knows that you will and can deal with you.  \n\n \n> Listen, Shyvana has one of the coolest potentials in league.\n\nI'm not sure riot can do anything about it because you forgot to mention Shyvana's real problem.  She's a power farming AFK jungler in a game that doesn't want that to be a thing anymore and wants games to end quickly.  She can't even put a timer on the game like nasus, veigar, kayle, kog, or vanye.  So she's only really good for that first teamfight or two, but she can't really be good because of jungle timers and the fact she can't really gank or invade.\n\nShyvana's problem is she doesn't fit into the game anymore and the devs can't even see how badly they've messed her up both directly and indirectly.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that she has a really weird build path when going the traditional route: she wants AS because her skills scale off of it but she wants bruiser stuff because that's what her role needs.  There aren't really the items to support that playstyle outside of trinity force, which is expensive.  That's another thing riot is going to have to look at.
