But last time I brought this up, TheCurator mentioned they won&#039;t delete an upvote bait thread if it leads to good discussion. However, there are two threads right now at the top of gameplay that offer no discussion and is just meaningless ramble. \r\n\r\nI understand the board has significantly more traffic than this one and as a result, it&#039;s hard to catch these threads. But it&#039;s prett strange that it only took your mods 5 minutes to delete my thread aimed at actually calling out moderation to, well, I don&#039;t know, do their jobs? \r\n\r\nhttp://imgur.com/hjGYXYZ\r\n\r\nThe rule is dumb as fuck anyway. If a thread has no intention to actually provoke thoughtful and relevant discussion then it needs to be deleted, regardless of what ends up happening with it. \r\n\r\nSo I&#039;m going to respectfully request that we change that stupid fucking policy and if people don&#039;t like that &quot;actual discussion&quot; gets deleted in a low effort farm bait thread, then those people should probably put that effort into real threads. It&#039;s a feedback section for balance, not a clown fiesta for bronze and silvers to upvote circlejerk each other. That&#039;s what GD and Memes and Games are for.","replies":[]}
