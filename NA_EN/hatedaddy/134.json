Banshees removes that weakness because these champions typically will be difficult to even pop the shield off in the first place. These champions already can be fairly difficult to engage on due to their long range and giving them the banshees shield will make that a bit more problematic. i like that banshees got a niche pick-up option but I&#039;m not sure this is the correct way to go about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-05-12T14:23:44.445+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh boy, Xerath and Veigar are going to be a bitch to fight.","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2017-05-12T16:10:17.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":":D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Penns","date":"2017-05-12T15:56:50.537+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Mages?

This will force enemies to decide how they want to break the spell shield, instead of sejuani charging in and throwing her bola for a guaranteed kill, or syndra force pushing a ball into your face and ending your life before you can say fuck. It is the tank meta right now, so they're trying to elongate games so I'd just go with it and build them on ADs and APs since going full squishy, even as a hyper carry mid, won't work as well anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ScissorsNstuff","date":"2017-05-12T14:18:46.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"this might be more true if cdr wasn't so abundant. But more than likely they do need to just take the AP down to like 50. As a matter of fact, they should remove the AP scaling and give banshee's veil an \"on ability contact\" effect like with {{item:3285}}  or {{item:3116}}. It would be nice if it combed with {{item:3151}} to do more noticeable anti-hp-stacking now that we've got champs hitting over 10k hp (or so I hear)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rewt","date":"2017-05-12T15:43:30.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"{{item:3814}}","replies":[]}]}
