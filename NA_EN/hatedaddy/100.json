In low elo he's bad. Most people in high elo will build him tanky anyway. He's not OP but his kit is overloaded. A skilled lee sin is god tier. Because of his playstyle any skill level below master lee sin player leaves him as an average champ.\n\nIf a pro lee sin player uses lee expect a nightmare. There is no way a casual lee sin player will be able to use lee to his full capacity. And lee is only OP when used at his highest skill level. The opposite can be said for champs like Zed, Kalista, Nidalee etc. Play a few games to get over the hump of their difficult to use skillsets and u reap huge rewards, and this is the same on all levels of play.","replies":[{"poster":"sparkye3","date":"2015-05-06T18:13:23.964+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"But the same thing can be said of {{champion:77}} , as anyone who really knows how to play him is also god tier.

This then becomes a question of skill not a champ being OP.\n\nTrue but udyr's counters are much more defined than Lee's since lee has the one thing udyr doesn't hae. Ranged gapclosers, and burst. Udyr gets kited so hard its very hard for him to be in any kind of competitive play, especially in the current tank meta where reaching the ADC will be virtually impossible against a coordinated team. On the other hand he is still probably one of the best splitpushers and 1v1ers in the game. He and trundle and riven suffer the same dilemma really. In skirmishes they are incredibly strong, but in teamfights trundle and udyr get kited incredibly hard, while riven just becomes too easy to kill unless she's really skilled.\n\nStill there are no OP champs in my opinion. OP was release rek'sai who could instagib with 3 Q's. OP was release xin zhao, and jax. Currently there are only champs who excel with certain core items or just fit in the meta extremely well. Ofcourse there are also the champs with problematic kits, but they are just generally overloaded and toxic for the game not OP.

The size of said range being massive for League considering the player base.\n\nAmongst all the multiple form champions I'd say nidalee is actualy one of the easiest to use simply because her mechanics are pretty binary. Elise is a champ who requires a lot of interaction and decision making when using each form so it takes quite a lot of skill to play her effectively. She also got gutted to shit tier which is a true shame amongst shames considering her kit is probably one of the most balanced kit wise. First you have to understand that with champions with numerous forms its VERY easy to overload them simply because of the large amount of spells in their repertoire. Due to this, one spell can never be too strong unless it has specific conditions that doesn't make it overbearing (stacking mechanisms, timers, things that have counterplay, etc.) \n\nNidalee is a champ thats very binary in the fact that she has some basic rules. Q Q Q Q Q until target hit, >> Cougar W E Q or whatever. That is what she will do 99.9% of the time. When ganked or need to escape >>Cougar W. Compared to other multiple form champs her skill floor is surprisingly low, but the thing about ALL hybrid champs like nid is they ALL have high skill caps because the more abilities you have, the more plays you can make. So you have to understand why nidalee is strong right now. She has one ability that is quite a bit overbearing on ALL levels of play (her spear obv), however it corresponds with an ability that might be just as strong (cougar Q). Since its %missing hp dmg and since you most likely took a lot of damage from the spear, it shows just how effective and overbearing her basic combo can be. Thus, nidalee is considered extremely overbearing, ESPECIALLY jungle nidalee where you could never predict where the spear was coming from. Whereas the spear is now considerably easier to dodge its main problem still remains....\n\nSHE HAS TOO MUCH SHIT IN HER KIT. Plain and simple. For a champion with so much potential damage, she has too much utility and mobility. However, unlike Lee Sin who has the same problem, the ability to use all of those skillfully and effectively is not restricted to high level play. She can build bruiser and assassinate squishies just as well when she build toplane bruiser nidalee as well. This is also extremely overbearing since she can't be fucked over the moment she goes in for the squishy. She won't get blown up, and if she fails the initial assassination she can sustain and survive through a teamfight with her heal and mobility. AP nid is more risk more reward so an entirely different boat, but her play is even more binary than bruiser nid (its literally entirely reliant on landing Q's) soooo yeah. That's my view on nidalee and why she's so hated.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BakedLotion","date":"2015-05-06T19:34:30.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HateDaddy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ahiUhEvE,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2015-05-06T02:09:36.436+0000)\n>\n> And now that tank Junglers are strong, he legit falls off late game.

Sure, technically she has hard CC but it's really weak. She's reatively immobile, just fast. She isn't ranged and her ranged abilities aren't overbearing. She just becomes too tanky to kill, can easily get to a back line and mauls squishy targets with base damage. In terms of mobility, she's actually relatively balanced since her mobility spell ties into her ult. She's just unbalanced and poor design because when she's good, she can't be kited, she's almost impossible to kill and her decision points start and end at \"do I run at you? Yes.\"\n\nYou're not incorrect, but there are exceptions. And as I noted, my case was rather extreme given its the second worst champion in the game. I could probably name someone line Ashe and do the same, but she's getting reworked into ranged pre rework Skarner.

For example, when I see a relatively straight forward champion with a 10% + pickrate sitting right at a 50% winrate, that alone kinda tells me they're probably okay. The issue you have here is the champions skill cap because it's relative. Not to mention, you need to probably provide some evidence from pro play too as that will ultimately show the true strengths and weaknesses of a champ if they're played at that level.\n\nLong story short, it can be used but it can't be your entire backing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lil Soybean","date":"2015-05-06T00:46:25.523+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bookmarked in case I need to reference this in the future.
