And armor stacking is already a really efficient way to reduce lifesteal tanking because lifesteal applies after damage reduction (or whatever order it applies in to significantly weaken LS but I believe it&#039;s after damage reduced). I think this keeps the same bland problem thornmail has now that makes it really underwhelming. Sure you get 100 armor but you get no HP and in the long run, there are far better options for tanking than 100 armor/no HP. And the passive now or a grevious wounds passive would feel pretty underwhelming for such a stat.\n\nMany champions kinda have LS as an identity to their kits that aren&#039;t ADCs and an item like this would be really punishing to them, I&#039;d say unfairly so. \n\nI would like to see the item gain more interesting gameplay while having moments of vulnerability and moments of clear strength. As an example, I&#039;d say after being auto attacked or taking any physical damage in a certain duration, the item begins to store that energy and reflect it back in damage after a certain threshold on-hit to anyone who auto attacks the thornmail holder (think of the mirror shield in Zelda OOT when fighting the witches). \n\nThere would be a clear glow or shine to the champion when the reflection is ready to pop and start returning a lot of damage and then this goes on cooldown for 60-70 seconds (almost like an AD hexdrinker/maw). This means if you want to continue focusing the tank, it comes with penalties but it also means focusing the tank isn&#039;t instant damage taken, which made it a frustrating item to deal with during cinderhulk meta. And if you elect not to focus the tank, the tank gets longer duration of life and longer zone control but in every situation, the item rewards proper gameplay rather than just being a punishment for focusing the champion with it or a punishment to the champion wasting 2300 gold on it when it&#039;s weak.\n\nJust my two cents, and even then I&#039;d rather not spend my last two pennies on the current thornmail. There&#039;s this grocery store by me that has a mechanical pony and rides only cost a penny, I&#039;d rather take two rides on that and bust jewels.","replies":[{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2016-09-07T22:53:08.967+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":6,"body":"\"Many champions have LS as an identity in their kits\"\n\n{{champion:266}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:64}} \n\nThat is the entirety of champions in the League who have Lifesteal on their kits.

Like it or not, many champions in this game having healing as an identity. As you noted, {{champion:16}} and {{champion:36}} are the two most iconic for this but they're also the chronic cases of abuse as to why *some form* of grevious wounds should exist in itemization. However, making it available to every class and every sub class also makes healing relatively worthless if it becomes so readily available that it would make anyone who depends on some healing even weaker in that regard. And I think having just two GW items alone push us to that brink. That's my concern and it's why I'm in no hurry to see another GW item.","replies":[{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2016-09-08T01:12:58.399+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The midway point isn't a healthy one for the reasons I mentioned.\n\nEither every class has easy access to Grievous Wounds, and the sustain based champs who aren't broken just deal with the consequences, or no champs have access to it and Mundo/Soraka/Trundle get brought back into line around that.\n\nThe problem is, as long as Ignite exists, number 2 isn't very likely. So that means we just have to bite the bullet and give tanks, assassins, supports and fighters their own Grievous Wounds items.\n\nIt would be cool to see the Immolation effect apply Grievous Wounds, since it shares some flavor with Ignite. Then the counterplay becomes \"Get away from the enemy\" instead of \"don't attack the enemy\". That's fairer. And you could put it on Sunfire (fighter item) and Cinderhulk (tank item) which solves both problems at once.\n\nFor assassins, the Nightfall on Duskblade could easily reduce healing.

In general you don't want to focus a tank. And items like {{item:3110}} have auras that slow your AS, meaning you'll likely be in its aura of yore forced to focus them. You likely don't want to focus that. Same with {{item:3143}}, you don't want to be forced to focus that either.\n\nEither way, you generally don't want to focus a tank but you have to. An item won't dictate that, if you could avoid it entirely regardless of what they built, it would.\n\nBut for arguments sake, let's say you're right, I don't think my proposal is super terrible in that regard.

In general you don't want to focus a tank. And items like {{item:3110}} have auras that slow your AS, meaning you'll likely be in its aura of yore forced to focus them. You likely don't want to focus that. Same with , you don't want to be forced to focus that either.\n\nFrozen Heart is, in my eyes at least, a pretty ideal tank item.  The mana and CDR helps the Tank make better use of their abilities to make themselves a threat.  Further, the attack speed nerf aura helps them protect their nearby allies simply by existing.  Both of those factors increase the threat of the Frozen Heart user.\n\nLess so with Omen, but that slow is nothing to sneeze at.  Omen is more of a soak/initiation item like Dead Man's, at least in my opinion.\n\nBut what about Thornmail?  How does it increase the user's threat?  Well, unless you scale off armor or have some way to force your foe to auto-attack you it really doesn't?  I mean, of course someone is going to attack that Shen sitting on their face.  But one way or the other, Thornmail exists to help people win duels, not be a better Tank.  And if we want Thorn to be a better armor item for tanky folks looking to improve their ability to duel auto-attack focused champions it seems to me that there are better ways to do it.\n\n> Either way, you generally don&#x27;t want to focus a tank but you have to.

It's like a more sustained damage-y version of Odin's Veil.  It would be a much more interesting and much more interactive item than what we've got right now.  I guess my underlying thought is that Thorn should increase the user's threat even when they *aren't* being attacked.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Serevas","date":"2016-09-07T22:33:00.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason thornmail is underwhelming as a tank item is it's not intended as a singular tank item, it's a niche late item pick up against teams with a lot of auto attackers.

This alone is a pretty bad design principle when you have to intentionally cripple an item to prevent it from being abused.\n\nI don't understand that, Thornmail wasn't broken before to begin with, it was still a niche item that could be picked against ADCs, but was mediocre against AD casters and useless against APs. Like now, but the difference is that before, it actually did damage against them.\n\nThe only reason I can think of why Riot changed this item is to discourage this item's usage as a single armor item. Previously, you could buy Thornmail as your only armor item, then build only HP and magic resistance, which was somewhat effective against almost full AP teams, but wasn't all that effective because other armor items can offer higher effective HP against physical damage (example, Randuin's Omen).\n\nAnother reason is to make this item more effective against on-hit champions, but honestly this item is still not effective against them. Most of them deal on-hit magic or true damage (Kayle, Kog, Yi, etc). To get the most of this item, you need to stack absurd amounts of armor, which is inneficient against those on-hit dealers to begin with, for that exact reason. Unless Riot made this item scale with HP or magic resistance as well (neither which would make sense)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2016-09-08T00:10:37.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HateDaddy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=E9ivEHab,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-09-07T23:52:24.923+0000)\n>\n> I understand its intention but niche items like that always end up being trash.

No, armor doesn't _punish_ champs who do physical damage, it is a healthy counterstat that allows you to mitigate their damage.  Armor penetration isn't _punishing_ tanks for the same reason.  It's easy to hate on ADCs, but imagine if items punished other classes for doing their jobs - thornmail for spells, maybe a bloodseeker-like effect that causes damage to champs who use mobility spells, an item that causes heals and shields to also damage the champ who casts them?\n\nEven if you disagree with me about damage return, this is all still missing the obvious point that lifesteal should be nerfed instead of creating some terrible woman-who-swallowed-a-fly chain of itemization.
