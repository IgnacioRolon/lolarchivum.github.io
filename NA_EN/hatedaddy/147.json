In terms of balance, I&#039;d actually say Nasus is fairly balanced but keep in mind leagues balance has been haywire this season so that isn&#039;t saying much. To also give you another piece of information here, I&#039;ve got thousands of games on Nasus since I started in s2 and I&#039;ve spent most of my time talking with a lot of good Nasus players about his builds/spikes/etc over the years like Hyfe, Steeleye and natekiller (most of these guys are oldies people wouldn&#039;t recognize today but just know Hyfe is the guy who came up with the CDR build on Nasus way back s1). \r\n\r\nNasus is in a strange spot right now, it&#039;s been something I&#039;ve felt slowly build up since last season&#039;s juggernaut patch but it&#039;s just gotten to a point where it feels as worse as it&#039;s ever been. It&#039;s not about his balance, it&#039;s just that quite frankly, in today&#039;s league of legends, Nasus just isn&#039;t that satisfying to play. You spend much of the early lane phase having keyboards, computer desks, monitors, dead cats and kitchen sinks thrown at you when all you&#039;re trying to do is farm. If you get decent farm and don&#039;t die a bunch, you can start bodying people but you have to balance this out with farming Q/scaling so there&#039;s a fine balance. Then you get to late game where he&#039;s supposed to be this God and quite frankly, he&#039;s just average late game because of how easy he is to kite and melt. So the end result is, he just doesn&#039;t feel satisfying to play and the risks don&#039;t feel like their justified with such a pipe dream of a reward.\r\n\r\nHonestly it&#039;s not too surprising, nasus&#039; kit is fucking ancient. He&#039;s one of the first 40 champions and one of the few to not even be considered for a rework yet. But frankly he needs it because most of his gameplay is actually pretty unhealthy and binary. He does teach some good basics to new players but no champion should remain a &quot;noob champ&quot; and stay bad for just that purpose, even Garen got reworked and he WAS THE noob champ. \r\n\r\nHis identity doesn&#039;t even fit him anymore, many other big beefy bruisers are better in almost every way than he is and outperform him at every phase of the game. I&#039;ve been over this a lot but really what has hurt Nasus is the evolution of this game in mobility and raw power behind spells that Nasus simply can&#039;t keep up with. Factor in that armor values and tank items have been nerfed across the board (which is something Nasus has always depended on hugely) and he doesn&#039;t even fit the tank role very well anymore. His natural steroids that should help him survive are easily avoided or mitigates and he has no way to deal with any of the problems he&#039;s presented, which goes back to my point about him being binary. \r\n\r\nBelieve it or not, there was once a point where getting farmed on Nasus meant carry city. But that doesn&#039;t happen anymore, you just become a gimmicky split pusher that&#039;s easy to collapse on and punish. I&#039;d rather play champs like Jax or Trynd who can pressure and get away from collapses and waste time as opposed to Nasus who just gets collapsed on and kited to death when he tries to fight anyone.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m just at a really disappointed point with Nasus and honestly that sucks. I continued to play this game because of him and he&#039;s the reason I was able to get diamond and improve in this game to the point I have and it&#039;s just awful to play him and feel so worthless now with no real ability to make a consistent impact like so many champions do now. \r\n\r\nI could go over potential solutions and changes that could make him healthier but there&#039;s no point because nothing will happen. I&#039;m just a long term Nasus main who hates where he&#039;s at right now and I&#039;m sure there&#039;s some Nasus players who feel the same and probably some who may feel differently. But it&#039;s frustrating to feel this way about him and I wish there was some support behind the idea of changing him for the better while making him a much healthier champion. \r\n\r\nThanks for reading loves","replies":[{"poster":"Sasogwa","date":"2016-07-15T08:14:19.198+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me try to explain why Nasus isn't a carry champion lategame anymore\n\n- Damage creep. Lategame damage dealing is pretty insane also most damage dealing keystones are not good on Nasus who has damage thanks to his Q mostly, while other picks rely a lot on the keystone to have free damage, unaccounted for.\n- Mobility creep, CC creep. Most of the CC is gradually being changed, for \"counterplay\" (aka adc whining), from being reliable targeted/ranged CC to shorter range spammable ~~cancer~~ CC. Basically, whenever you come close to a support like {{champion:201}} {{champion:111}} , hell even {{champion:432}} or any guy with {{item:3116}} kites you to death easily, while not being that great for CC'ing carries from range. Well right muh counterplay, but you can't really dodge CC from melee range and those CC are terribly punishing, so it's basically impossible to reach the backline if you're not an overloaded assassin.\n\nWhat does this imply? Nasus can not go for his favourite targets anymore, aka squishy carries that he absolutely crushes in 1v1 if they're not protected. Huge flat (by that I mean not in % health) damage with triforce procs and 40 flat arpen on E (it's like {{item:3142}} + {{item:3147}} + {{item:3156}} for the amount of arpen) ? Squishy killing dream. Well great, but you can't reach them, if they're not completely stupid they get behind their protection.\nSo this means the people Nasus fights in a teamfight is the frontline.\nYet, Nasus is bad at it. He has his ult that deals a good amount of %health, but it's over an incredibly long duration and with the damage creep, it's not that great (despite the values looking pretty high).\nBut he was completely ignored in the juggernaught rework. Before they were reworked, juggernaughts were just basically lane bullies that falled off incredibly hard and only relied on base damages. Now they have {{item:3071}} which is insanely good for melting tanks/helping their teammates melt tank, they have great HP+AD items added and they can actually do their job.\nNasus meanwhile is a juggernaught with the scalings of a utility tank. He loves CDR, resistances and sheen procs. He has a very hard time proccing {{item:3071}} so that's not an option for him (**It could actually be one if his E did physical damage and become much more of a juggernaught**. Yet the stats are still meh for him, you really want resistances tied to your CDR items early and you'd rather have {{item:3078}} or {{item:3025}} ).\n\nA big thing that changed Nasus power status lategame is the slow nerf, and I can't stress it enough. It used to be a 35-95% aka 65% average attack speed slow !\nNow it's 32.5 % average attack speed slow. Barely even noticeable. And {{item:3222}} exists, {{item:3140}} no longer builds into nothing (god {{item:3139}} was a huge mistake).\nThat's a huge part of his power budget lategame gone, and even if it's not necessarily healthy to basically say f*ck you to an AA based champ, it was most of Nasus teamfighting power.\n\nNasus actual big strengths are still there and it's possible to carry a game with him. It is basically \"be better than your opponent (hope he's not master material) hard farm for 20 minutes and carry the game while it's still midgame and people don't have too much items (hope that the game has a low amount of kills else they will already have a good amount of items) and then end the game before you become irrelevant in a teamfight.\nThis is not what we want. This is not the Nasus fantasy, or what you wish for when playing as Nasus. The whole purpose of playing Nasus apart from being the doge is the lategame infinite scaling. Now who cares about your 1000 stacks when you get melted and crushed in teamfights, and splitpush is in a bad spot? Nasus lategame teamfights are terrible and that sucks for the iconic infinite scaling guy, it's just sad.\n\nCurrently, ironically enough, Nasus works better against what countered him in lane than what he countered in lane.\nI'd rather face a {{champion:92}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:39}} than a tank, because I know they don't have as much CC and tankiness come lategame so I'll have an easier time outright killing them or doing some work in teamfights. It's actually not a great idea anymore to pick Nasus into a tanks because thanks to keystones they actually have damage and they're more useful in a teamfight. Also some have hardengage, denying your splitpush if they group.\n\nBut since we're here to discuss solutions, these are some of the options I have thought through :\n\n-> Since Nasus fights mostly tanks in teamfights, here are some possibilities to make his kit better at fighting them while soaking damage\n\n- E flat armor shred -> % armor shred instead.\n- Magical -> physical? Idk about this, I'm not sure BC would be optimal with that change also it is sad that it kills Nasus AP.\n- Passive lifesteal is based on opponent's armor. You lifesteal pathetic amounts against a very high armor target.\nSolution? Make it not lifesteal but some true steal that ignores armor, slightly reduce the values -> Nasus is even worse earlygame and in lane, since you lifesteal off low armor minions anyway, but is actually more relevant in lategame where he can really become harder to kill.\n- What if E granted Nasus bonus resistances while inside the circle? It would fortify Nasus identity as a zone control juggernaught that is hard to kill when he is inside his zone, it does not help him so much in chasing because he's gonna be out of the circle at the beginning or the end.\nThought of something like 5/10/15/20/25% bonus resistances. Compensate with slightly lower values on either the armor shredding or the base damage of Nasus E.\n- Buff the attack speed slow? Ofc not up to the really insane values it once had but we could make it a bit more noticeable, especially since the counterbuilding is really available now {{summoner:1}} {{item:3140}} {{item:3222}} .\nFor reminders it's _**at max rank**_ 17.5 to 47.5 %\nused to be 35 to 95%\nI suggest something like 20 to 60 % which is really really not a huge buff and far from the original values.\n\n\nThese are suggestions, and do not come in a package.

Consider them separated one from another (choose whichever, think about it, come up with your own ideas)\n\nHey thanks for the response. I was debating on breaking it down like this but I kind of just vented more frustration than rational thoughts but this is spot on. Nasus doesn't have a late game fantasy anymore, just hope the enemy team allows you to farm free for 20 minutes in a high CS, low kill, no pressure game and then you have about a 5 minute window to have an impact.\n\nEverything also gets 40% CDR now which make spamming slows, CCs and mobility spells more frequent whereas Nasus has always capped CDR so this isn't new for him individually. \n\nIn reality, Nasus arguably has received more indirect nerfs than any champion in the game and his indirect buffs simply haven't let up.","replies":[{"poster":"Great Ozymandius","date":"2016-07-29T21:27:17.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Nasus doesn't have a late game fantasy anymore, just hope the enemy team allows you to farm free for 20 minutes in a high CS, low kill, no pressure game and then you have about a 5 minute window to have an impact.\n\nSo sad but completely true.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Great Ozymandius","date":"2016-07-29T21:26:28.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bingo, I agree with pretty much everything you said.  \n\nNasus has always had problems with being kited but damage creep means he dies much much faster while kited.  For the last season and a half I have almost entirely avoided teamfights as nasus.  It is better to force the enemy team to split up to try and stop your splitpush than to group for a 5v5.  In 5v5's you always get stuck on the enemy frontline.  You don't tank as well as the enemy frontline, you don't have any hard engage, you can't put your cc on the targets that matter, you can't get good value from your lifesteal, and you don't do much damage versus high armor targets.  Pretty much you are a meatshield and a bad one at that.  \n\nI also agree that I would rather face a panth/riven/ than a nautilus as Nasus.  Sure, I might farm better versus the nautilus, but I'd rather have the opportunity to outscale riven than be forced into bad 5v5's.  \n\nNasus is no longer a late game champion.  He is a midgame champion.  If he  isn't threatening the enemy inhibitor by 30 minutes, he's lost the game and he needs to be carried by his teammates.  \n\n\nA change I thought of would be: \n\nAfter 400 stacks, activating q (not autoing with the q) also gives him a movespeed bonus, which scales with additional q-stacks.  After 800 stacks, activating q removes slows.  \n\nThis would give him more ability to get to the enemy backline in teamfights, would add to his scaling fantasay, and would retain his weak early game.  \n\n\nI liked your suggested changes to his lifesteal, spirit fire, and wither.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CerealBoxOfDoom","date":"2016-07-15T03:27:11.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nasus is strong when his counters get shoved out of the meta\nnasus is not strong when his counters are not actively being shoved out of the meta","replies":[{"poster":"HateDaddy","date":"2016-07-15T03:29:14.657+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CerealBoxOfDoom,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8XJVbqiK,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-07-15T03:27:11.369+0000)\n>\n> nasus is strong when his counters get shoved out of the meta\n> nasus is not strong when his counters are not actively being shoved out of the meta\n\nThis has very little to do with his actual strength as a champion tbh \n\nLike I said, he's not really weak right now.

The consistent and best course of action is to afk split push and teleport into fights or flank but flanking in solo queue is so hard because vision control rarely happens and teleporting into fights is too risky now with the increased channel time, by the time you get there it's over. Considering this and his weak early game, it's not rewarding at all but it has to be this way because his stacks scale infinitely and even though his stack amounts almost never win games, they have to be balanced like they do because if he had mobility, huge durability naturally or insane base stats, it would matter and he'd be a balancing nightmare (if he isn't already)\n\nNow as for what I'd do? Personally, many Nasus players since s2 have basically said if he ever gets reworked, we'd prefer for his Q to be capped or have diminishing returns so he can have strength in other areas. Wither has to go, it's just not a healthy spell and chain withering made him toxic as shit in s3. Spirit fire is cool, there's a lot of cool stuff you can do with that spell. I'd focus on making it an actual zone control spell that slows after a certain duration or grants him some sort of buff. His ult is fine as is, a fairly straight forward ult but god damn between Fury of the Sands and Dominus (renektons ult), these two ults fit their fucking champion characters down to the T. So I'd probably cap his Q at around 400-500 stacks or give it some sort of scaling with farm if it's kept infinite so it never gets out of control and I'd give his W and E an interaction between each other where his W stuns a target if in his E for X amount of time and his Q consumes this debuff and reducing all his basic ability CDs signs target can fight back.\n\nTl;dr\n\nIt's a lot of mumbo jumbo now but I thought about this a lot back in the day.

If anything he is probably 1 of  10 champs in the game that is completely balanced. \n\nFirst off let's get something straight, split pushing is no longer a viable tactic for anyone Nasus notwithstanding. The game currently encourages high mobility, %health damage or true damage kits. Making it next to impossible to split push and not be melted by a 2v1 situation regardless of who you are playing unless you are incredibly fed for some reason.\n\nArmor and Magic Resist Nerfs only hit some of his original core items. Mainly Frozen Heart, Randuin's and Banshee's. These items used to be core but are really sub optimal on Nasus anymore. Especially FH it just doesn't feel as good on him over IBG. Randuin's can still be good if you have a critical chance lover but usually I don't need it. \nIBG into Thorn Mail against AA reliant match up's is insanely good rush right now. People want to poke you down before engaging typically and Thorn Mail really makes that hard to do without them killing themselves while you self heal.\nAP ranged tops are the real problem no MR item feels great to rush against them and this is singularly one of the hardest things to deal with as Nasus. \n\nProper Runes are a thing of the past. Everyone is rushing for AD reds instead of AR Pen or Hybrid Pen. If you can't last hit as Nasus without the extra AD then I personally think you need more practice. The very second you have over 100 stacks and sheen you will see a massive return with penetration runes. I've experimented both ways and I always do close to 5-6k more damage per game with these runes. This allows you better healing return from tanks and squishes alike. Typical set up are Marks- Hybrid Pen, Seals- Scaling Health, Glyphs- 6 Flat CDR and 3 Scaling CDR and Quints- Armor or MR depending on match up. \n\nDamage items ARE good on Nasus. But only certain ones. You need a sheen item for sure. Arguably if you can get a Trinity you will not need another damage item. But if you get IBG then getting Titanic Hydra or Sterak's Gage is an awesome boost to Nasus. Obviously you won't buy either of these until 4th or 5th item and if you complain about \"losing mah stacks bra!\" from Titanic Hydra then you under farmed early. Titanic gives you a lot of damge on the front line, sustain and the ability to damage multiple enemies or push a wave into tower faster so you can join your team or create pressure. Another viable option is Maw but it far more situational and don;t ever buy with Steraks as their passives do not stack. By the time you have this item you should already have 400-600 stacks and be team fighting. If you are solely concerned with stacks all game then you will lose no and's, if's or but's about it. \n\nLastly, a good Keyestone is incredibly important to Nasus. Let's look at them all.\n\n**Ferocity tree**\n\nWarlords- extra life steal based on missing health. Benefit 50% vs minions and 100% vs champions. If we get poked down we still get bonus life steal to heal on minion without trading with enemy champion and pushing the lane. \n\nFervor- Extra AD stacking up to 6 times for trading with enemy champion. Gives us nothing early game as we do not want to trade early as Nasus.\n\nDeathfire Touch- Adds burn to damaging abilities and AA for a % of AD or AP. Early trading or Spirit Fire spamming? No thanks., \n\n**Cunning Tree**\n\nStorm Raiders Surge- dealing 30% of chmpions health gives you 70% SLOW ONLY immunity. Woopdiedo, if you get stunned, silenced, rooted, feared or some other horrid CC. \n\nThunderlords- 3 damaging strikes on the same enemy champion gives you a burst of damage based on % of AD and AP. Again early game trading and doesn't apply your stacked damage later so really worthless in the long run.\n\nWindspeakers- Yeah we aren't a support so no.\n\n**Resolve Tree**\n\nGrasp- Excellent late game if we build enough health but sub optimal early as it encourages early trading. However it becomes good once you can trade around 10 minutes or so.\n\nStrength of Ages- 300 health is awesome but it stacks somewhat slowly and the 6% max health heal on large siege minions and epic monsters late game is great but this does nothing for us early. \n\nBond of Stone- Not bad in a solo lane but in team fights you really don't want to to take extra damage for anyone else. \n\nBy taking warlords you improve your early survivability the most and still have it as a great benefit late game you just lose out the tenacity from the resolve tree. Grasp is great if you think you can survive an easier match up. \n\nSorry this turned into a long post but I thought it was necessary to give a synopsis of everything.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neo Metalsonic","date":"2016-07-15T05:30:36.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nasus is very weak in competitive play.

Good players can kite him and kill him. He has a garbage teamfight even when he has a lot of stacks. The amount of CC in some comps force Nasus to only split-push, which can be frustrating. A simple comp such as {{champion:201}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:62}} and {{champion:51}} would make Nasus completely useless. Other frequently played comps could do that same, but one such as this would make so that nasus would HAVE to split push the entire game.\n\nThe absolute worst is when you finally get close to killing someone after spending 30 seconds to a minute to gap close and then they use a summoner to escape. It is why {{item:3800}} and {{item:3025}} are great items on him and see more use than they did in the past on him.\n\nI do think Nasus' stacks have diminishing returns already. He can't afford to AFK farm after 20 minutes and in the late game most people have itemized in a manner to mitigate his damage. \n\nI also think since the mastery changes his early defensive stats are pretty poor. Armor items have been nerfed slightly since I started playing and it is noticeable on Nasus. I remember on the old mastery page you could get 10% additional Armor or MR off you bonus Armor or MR. Now I think it is 5 or 6%. And since most armor items provide less armor than they use too Nasus can't simply build full tank and be unkillable while getting kited.\n\nWhen merc treads were terrible with really low tenacity I think that was when Nasus was at an all time low in terms of his useability in Gold or higher.\n\nI think Nasus' stacks should give him a bonus to his tenacity at certain thresholds. I think by making that simple change Nasus instantly becomes viable again for rewarding players that can stack effectively.\n\nIf they buff armor items at any point Nasus will also become a better champion than his current state.\n\nI understand that a lot of opponents think Nasus is a ticking time bomb. They can't stand playing against him because most competent Nasus players CAN stack pretty well against high amounts of harrass. As long as they don't die he should be able to eventually out scale and kill him.\n\nThere are some champions that Nasus stinks against and typically losses lane too even if the skill of the players is pretty even. Hard Nasus lane counters include {{champion:114}}, {{champion:48}}, {{champion:17}}, and {{champion:2}}. Then there are other champions that counter Nasus with early pressure. These matchups are more skill-oriented, but the Nasus player typically has to play A LOT better to deal with these types of matchups and avoid early deaths in order to outscale ({{champion:122}}, {{champion:86}}, {{champion:24}}, and {{champion:80}}). \n\nThen you have match-ups in which the Nasus can outscale and avoid the harass, but he has a really hard time killing these opponents due to their skills or their tankyness. He basically doesn't win or lose lane if he farms well {{champion:57}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:78}}. These are pretty annoying match-ups because the longer the game goes on the greater the utility of these champions over Nasus. Nasus also can rarely kill a player that is well verse with that champion. \n\nBy the time Nasus can do damage the game may already determined. \n\nFavorable matchups for Nasus exist, but they also are largely determined by him not dying at all. Champions such as {{champion:23}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:27}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:126}} are all pretty good matchups for Nasus. But the condition is that he can not die to them really at all. Most of these champions see less play than others int he top lane due to their general weakness relative to other top laners. \n\nI really like Nasus' kit, however, I do think he needs a greater reward for farming effectively since the strength of items really effect the strength of Nasus.\n\nStacking is easy, but making sure you don't die while doing so, not getting kited, positioning in teamfights, and knowing when to split-push and make decisions are all REALLY hard in higher Elo.\n\nNasus is amazing in lower Elo because their is no coordination to take him down. In higher Elo a coordinated effort can completely shutdown a Nasus, which is incredibly frustrating if you lane and stack well. I can't tell you how many games I stack well, win lane, and avoid early death, just to get chain CC'd in a teamfight and die instantaneously.\n\nI will say storm raiders surge is a bit of a blessing and a curse for Nasus. Nasus gives up the tenacity from the resolve tree to get storm raiders, however, if a team has hard CC in their comp storm raiders is virtually useless.\n\nTL;DR\n\nHis base stats need a buff since the mastery changes\nGrant bonus tenacity based on stacks (it would have to be a small % probably)\nArmor and MR items need buffs","replies":[]},{"poster":"Incognonymous","date":"2016-07-15T19:19:10.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nasus is a scary objective control jungle.
