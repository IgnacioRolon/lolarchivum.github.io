Now, I will be honest - most of the time I go to those lengths, it is warranted. And I suspect we will still flame each other at times and thats fine because thats the internet. But I am sure everyone has someone they would like to apologize to because I do believe most of us are good people who might get caught up in the heat of the moment from time to time.\r\n\r\nSo with that said, I want to reach out to Just Mid and say I am sorry. Recently, I have posted in a few threads with you and as it turns out, you are a really kick ass dude. And i realized, I called you a bronie at one point because of one of your FEKs and it was meant to be completely disrespectful and demeaning and honestly bro, I was a total ass for that and I am really sorry. I know you ain't a bronie and I know your passion is art, more specifically drawing, and you enjoy drawing them. And a lot of other stuff too and thats awesome. I hope you stick around, you make this community a better place and I think we need more people like you. Take care dawg.","replies":[]}
