{"poster":"HateDaddy","date":"2017-06-04T07:23:08.468+0000","title":"Are we going to stop pretending Pantheon isn't a problem right now?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":99,"down_votes":41,"body":"He's been sitting at a 54-55% winrate now for the last several patches. This isn't an outlier, it's not just his \"mains.\" He's sitting at 7% pickrate, which is moderately popular especially in top lane. He also doesn't really \"fall off\" until 40+ minutes. \n\nhttps://na.op.gg/champion/pantheon/statistics/top\n\nPantheon as a lane dominator used to have a very clear avenue to be defeated: outsustain his mana pool. Between corrupting potion, meditation mastery and thunderlords, Pantheon wins almost every top lane match-up with his mana costs not really being a problem anymore. Yes, there are some champions who beat him but that doesn't justify his ridiculous winrate and how effortless it is to stomp lane AND ROAM with a semi-global ultimate. This champion has needed to be reworked for a long time, his design is ancient and a product of a very different game where matches were won and lost based on counterpicks. League has obviously gotten away from that. There should be more to lane than eating autistic spear after autistic spear but that's literally all Pantheon does. \n\nAs for nerfs, I would honestly suggest increasing the cooldown on his Q a bit and perhaps reducing execute crit passive damage on his E. I don't mind the idea of Pantheon being a lane bully but not to the extent that he is and not with the very little effort and interaction required to go about it. If he wants to bully, he needs to actually commit more than just spears. He needs to risk his tail and actually make use of his passive rather than the lane just be the following series of events: \n\neat spears\nhave him passive block\n W/E \nPassive block\n Spear \nhaha you're dead\n\nAnd yes, I did just play against pantheon and yes I will admit a clear and obvious bias. I did not lose but I fucking hate this champion and he is one of the worst designed champions in the game. Laning against him is miserable, I don't care if he \"falls off.\" Riot has gone away from champions who dominate lane like that for a reason, because people hate playing against that shit. It will be inevitable that somebody will throw out \"haha just play champion x and make him cry.\" Okay and what about the thousands of other times he's used to counterpick you and 90% of the top lane roster? Furthermore, his statistics are simply too high right now. He needs nerfs plain and simple.","replies":[{"poster":"fuffychan","date":"2017-06-04T07:45:28.910+0000","up_votes":70,"down_votes":9,"body":"\"buy armor\"\n\n\"dont trade with him\"\n\n\"gank with your jungler\" \n\n\"he falls off\"\n\nDid I get all the usual useless replies?","replies":[{"poster":"HateDaddy","date":"2017-06-04T07:59:39.700+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":9,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=fuffychan,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=RF8rXEGu,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-06-04T07:45:28.910+0000)\n>\n> &quot;buy armor&quot;\n> \n> &quot;dont trade with him&quot;\n> \n> &quot;gank with your jungler&quot; \n> \n> &quot;he falls off&quot;\n> \n> Did I get all the usual useless replies?\n\nI will never understand this boards love affair with that champion.

He's very powerful in lane and needs to be respected, but if you just hug tower, play like a bitch and whether the storm, he'll fall off and be pretty useless.  Now, he has the tools to get ahead anyway.   He's good at tower diving and ganking other lanes with his ult... but that is the whole point.  He is TRYING to get a huge lead early because his lategame is pretty trash unless he's huge.\n\nSo the name of the game isn't \"beat this guy in lane\" the name of the game is \"don't let this guy become huge\".  Which is perfectly doable.  I'm going to assume you disagree based on the rage post, and I'll admit his Q in particular is an old mechanic that can be a bit frustrating since you can't avoid it... but there are plenty of other champs with point and click damage spells... not all of them even super old like panth.  \n\nWhat do YOU feel is a better \"strong early but falls off\" champ?  Because I'd say he's what they should be shooting for when they design those kinds of characters, not someone to rage at and nerf.  If you nerf his early lane dominance he literally HAS nothing else.  It's all he's really good for.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2017-06-04T18:27:28.677+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":5,"body":"I don't think that Pantheon is a good example for the concept of a lane bully.\nMostly because all his stuff is unavoidable.\n\nHis Q is point&click harass, his W is point&click CC. Granted, his E isn't point&click, but with his usual combo you are stunned while he is executing it anyway.\nIf his whole play pattern is so extremely reliable, it feels kinda bad to lane against him. Being forced to sit under your tower the whole game trying to not interact with your opponent in any way is not fun gameplay.\n\nPantheon doesn't really give you the chance to interact with him. He is guaranteed to hit his stuff on you while you can't trade back alot because of his blocks.\n\nIllaoi and Darius are pretty strong lane bullies, too. But they allow counterplay. You can play around their kit, dodge stuff and all. It is possible to lane against them. You have to be extremely careful while doing so and try to dodge as much as you can.
