Having said that, while I agree with you, in Silver, the near-universal bans are Akali, Katarina, Zed, and Fizz.\n\nAlso very common, though, are Blitzcrank, Tristana, and Warwick. I can't believe how common Blitzcrank, Akali, and Warwick are, considering that I don't consider them particularly problematic at all. Seems like a total waste of a ban, because I'd pick Kalista, Jarvan, Pantheon, or even Sivir over them every time.\n\nAll the champs you just mentioned are almost never banned at my average-level play, maybe one out of 15-20 times, if that. To be honest, the only champ I find to be desperately problematic is Katarina, because once she starts going, she's nearly impossible to stop unless we're loaded with enough CC to stop her before she comes in for a Lotus.","replies":[{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2015-02-18T13:40:11.694+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blitz is probably from the fact that if he lands his Q after level 6, you may as well open up the shop window, cause you're about to die; 2 hard and one soft CC chained back to back means that unless the enemy ADC is completely unaware of Blitz's play or your laning partner is ready to save your butt, you're dead.\n\nAkali tends to snowball. Well, used to tend to snowball. I don't know how well she's doing now, don't see her that often.\n\nWarwick is probably still being banned from back when he pretty much dominated the jungle; even Lee Sin was hard-pressed to keep up with him.

But regardless of who I'm playing, you can pretty much tell when Blitz is going to use his Q, which is when he activates his W. It's kind of a dead giveaway when he does that so he can get a better shot. And of course, if he's running toward you for any reason, it's extremely unlikely he's trying to 1v1 you. Blitz naturally doesn't tend to travel alone.\n\nAkali does tend to snowball if left unattended, but for the first time in almost forever, I'm seeing people ban Diana now, because they share similarities (their ults are nearly identical, and they both benefit a lot from \"marking\" targets first).\n\nWarwick, I'm not sure. He can get annoying, but Infinite Duress got hit so hard, he doesn't have anywhere near the same level of ganking power he used to. Not that he's not a competent jungle pick, but I don't consider him overpowered, and if I go against him, I feel a lot better than if I see, say, a Jarvan, a Lee Sin, or a Vi.\n\nStill, totally granted, if someone has a Blitz and they know how to use them well enough to not give clear indicators when they're about to Rocket Fist you, that can quickly bring your best carrier down and cost you the whole match if it's late enough in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2015-02-18T20:50:27.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blitz isn't an issue for junglers, but as the support I can tell you that bot lane against a Blitz is several orders of magnitude more tense than laning against any other support, even Thresh.

Because he punishes stupid play. An ADC shouldnt be AFK farming by themselves without vision yet they persist to do it. Leblanc does the same thing but bursts you harder faster, why no outrage for her? \n\nI know Kassadins teamfight is largely based on cleaning up, so if his team isn't ahead by miles, he can be dealt with. I know Kassadins wave clear sucks so we can actually shove on him. Kassadins early lane phase is very poke oriented, I don't have to worry about him 100-0ing my mid at level 2 (LEBLANC).

It'd be like limiting Ashe's ult in range so she can't pull off clutch arrows across the map anymore. Or if when they remade Soraka her ult was revamped and no longer gave her a global team heal.\n\nAnd... and.. I dunno, I can't really think of enough examples, but still, it's one of those things where it feels a lot better if those achievable things stay possible, we all dream of landing an almost impossible arrow and turning a fight around. We all want to be in position to dance around the nexus in a desperate effort to get it down before we're finally caught, and have a chance of managing to do so.\n\nGame balance isn't only about what strengths and potential a champion has to do well in combat, it's also about what inspiration you can give the players, what limits they can stretch themselves to and what potential is there for them.\n\nNew Soraka gives me a much stronger ability to clutch save people, I can rush up, and get several of my teammates from low to high health, and if I build for it with summoners ({{summoner:7}} ) and items({{item:3222}}) , and I land my Qs, I can be relatively healthy myself. I have to work for it, but I can turn the game around.\n\nAnd any champion should be defined by how they turn a game around, whether it's something mechanically intensive they excel in, or something tactical or strategical.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2015-02-18T23:53:57.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Literally every champion that gets nerfed gets a complaint thread on these boards.\n\nEven Warwick got a complaint thread about Riot nerfing him when he was super fucking toxic at the start of preseason 5.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Economicz","date":"2015-02-18T23:48:50.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The one?
