Initially I didn't think the feast buffs would mean much, but holy shit you stack up so fast now. \r\n\r\nCho'Gath has always been one of the best at objective control. That's even bigger now. Cho'Gath has always had decent ganks. With stalker enchantment, his ganks just got harder to outplay. Cho'Gath has always been a sustain freak. That's a huge plus for any jungler currently. \r\n\r\nWith juggernaut enchantment plus feast stacking incredibly fast, ChoGath becomes incredibly tanky really fast. And he's one of the best aura tank junglers (building aura items like locket, frozen heart etc) because of how well he does with both CDR and defensive itemization. \r\n\r\nHe is honestly probably one of the best junglers at the moment, I am not saying he is OP though. Because I don't think he is. I'd rather have a jungler dominated by champions like ChoGath who need good teams to play around over Lee Sin who can single handily carry a game from the moment it starts by building a little damage and disregard clearing and just get double buffs and gank. \r\n\r\nSo I am here to pledge my allegiance to the United Void of Cho'Gath.","replies":[{"poster":"Haestro","date":"2015-01-05T21:26:29.978+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"OMG, stop picking Cho'gath he sucks\" is the only qq I expect to hear.","replies":[{"poster":"HateDaddy","date":"2015-01-05T21:32:20.945+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Haestro,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vA8dYRW1,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-01-05T21:26:29.978+0000)\n>\n> \"OMG, stop picking Cho'gath he sucks\" is the only qq I expect to hear.\n\nDon't worry, wait until the pros start picking him and you'll see the same people do a 180 and yell at you for not picking him.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-01-05T22:20:28.833+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember how people were saying Zillean sucked before Worlds this year, or that Annie supp was bad during season 3.\n\nIts always amusing to watch those same people go \"I knew they were strong all along!\"","replies":[{"poster":"Spacesuit Spiff","date":"2015-01-06T19:36:11.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cameron2325,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vA8dYRW1,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2015-01-05T22:20:28.833+0000)\n>\n> I remember how people were saying Zillean sucked before Worlds this year, or that Annie supp was bad during season 3.\n> \n> Its always amusing to watch those same people go \"I knew they were strong all along!\"\n\n\"I haven't played mid in a while so I'll just take Zilean and hopefully be easy to carry\"\n\"Wtf I can't carry a Zilean mid\"\nThen one week later Faker uses him and he's in every game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2015-01-06T02:27:48.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still hate Annie \"support\".

And I think Cho'Gath will always have a lower winrate because he's actually really hard to play. \n\nAnd team fighting, it's basically peeling and disrupting, which any decent Cho'Gath has always been good at.

They just have a lot of stuff in their kits that survive nerfs moreso than many other champions. Which should say a lot about them - get nerfed hundreds of times, still God tier.\n\nRiots approach to the jungle is pretty satisfying honestly. They are buffing a lot of junglers and they really aren't nerfing any currently, which I'm totally okay with Lee Sin (to an extent) if other junglers get to his power level and are allowed to remain there. The question is, will these buffs get these junglers to that level and if they do, will riot not jump the gun this time and nerf them hard again. History says no but this is the first time they've acknowledged that this is a problem and thus the changes to the jungle and the items. Instead of nerfing champions, nerf items instead. \n\nI know Warwick got mega nerfed but Riot forecasted that correctly before the preseason even began because they knew the changes would make him absurd in both itemization and the ability to sustain in the new jungle, which actually matters. What this means is if champions like Lee, Kha and Elise screw up ganks early, they get punished for it because they can't just go AFK clear the jungle to catch back up because in the past, their innate sustain and clear time were both good enough to give them the capacity to do this, which shouldn't be the case for any jungler.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SlackerboyTC","date":"2015-01-05T23:43:28.380+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"And this isnt even his final form :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"RottedApples","date":"2015-01-05T22:32:39.602+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"saw meteos play it, must be viable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"i love legos ","date":"2015-01-05T23:10:21.143+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"TheI3igDaddy","date":"2015-01-06T01:48:35.613+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do realize that level E first allows you to clear jungle mobs very quickly without using any mana?
