Discussion inside!","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":59,"down_votes":8,"body":"People complain that tanks are weak and honestly, I&#039;ve made it known I strongly disagree. However, I will not deny for a second that keystones have made this game a nightmare to balance and have warped the games balance so many times this season.\r\nAnd much of that is because reliable damage keystones like thunderlords and fervor can give literally anything the ability to do damage while not paying much for it in return.\r\n\r\nPeople talk about tanks dying instantly, again I disagree but let&#039;s not forget that for half of this season, tanks were running grasp (which does pretty considerable damage honestly) or thunderlords and were running around killing everything while being incredibly hard to kill. \r\n\r\nNo matter what meta we are in, and I&#039;d argue we are in a strange state where a little bit of everything is good right now, the amount of reliable damage any class can put out is absurd. And that kind of damage come from all classes is bad for the game, both balance wise and for just the sheer experience. Nobody enjoys playing against a champion that typically builds glass or semi glass and decides they will go full tank and abuse fervor/grasp procs. Nobody likes playing against semi glass or glass champions that build Trinity and tank after that and abuse Trinity procs + fervor. These are a few examples that illustrate my point.\r\n\r\nIn reality, the issue is this: runes and masteries should not be this game changing/warping. There&#039;s enough variables as is to consider when it comes to balancing and when you begin balancing around masteries that will eventually be changed anyway, you further set the game into a state of chaos. The old mastery system was fine, much like the rune system is fine now. Yes its stale but it has to be because otherwise you get this mess.\r\n\r\nI urge you to consider removing keystones this coming season and simply go back to a more simplistic mastery system so we aren&#039;t spending chunks of a season running the same 2 mastery setups on every class until the next setup is buffed while the old one is being nerfed. And despite all of this and the attempt of making masteries more interesting, in reality the masteries with keystones have just become more boring. That tells you how flawed this idea is.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-08-14T20:43:28.638+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly I like the idea of the keystones as they (in theory) allow for more options and decision making at the end of a tree.

The easier and more reliable it is, the more consistent it does therefore the more likely it is to win. I will do whatever it takes to win in ranked games and that branches out even down to how I'll setup runes and masteries accordingly. \n\nI just don't think runes/masteries should have such power. Many items in this game alone have a ton of power and factor in all the kits we have in this game and you begin to see how many variables there are to balance out. Keystones add another layer to an already complex and chaotic system of balance. If items or champion kits were weaker or simpler, I think keystones would be a great addition. But in league of legends, that's simply not just the case. A good example of what I mean is Renekton with fervor. Let him hit you with a full fury W and watch this alone take 70% of your HP in the early game. Much of that has to do with how it stacks fervor and 20% of that damage is probably from fervor alone. The game has too many complexities for something like that to be existing imo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-08-14T20:50:56.048+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"Well, at least for Sona, I'm pretty damn convinced that Windspeaker is far better than Thunderlord.

Adding more variables to the game subsequently increases the chance for imbalance. Simple is better in my opinion.\n\nI can't think of a better paradigm than this:\nhttp://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hv0NuR1zEFQ/UNS6VdRZKFI/AAAAAAAABlU/7dedd5dQs2U/s1600/bamboleo2.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"ABSINTHEged","date":"2016-08-16T00:09:49.469+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hell yes they were a mistake.\n\nThere are always going to be champions that abuse them and they're a fairly significant source of hidden power.\n\nSo much for clarity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Seenan","date":"2016-08-15T19:56:08.171+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keystones like Stormraider's or maybe Warlord's are pretty great concepts and aren't too op compared to Fervor or TLD.

The thing is, Ferver and TLD exist as the strongest masteries/masteries that give unnecessary amounts of damage...A solid 80 extra phys damage per auto at level 18.

They are supposed to be strong effects that have the potential to change the way you play your champion/play against the enemy champion.\n\nThe issue is, imo, that a) the defensive mastery tree is comparatively too weak and b) 3 of the damage keystones are too general and c) we are lacking a real defensive keystone.\n\nThe issue described in b) relates to the fact that neither Fervor of Battle nor Thunderlord's nor Grasp change anything in the way you need to play your champion - Fervor simply gives your auto-attacks more punch for continously auto-attacking, Thunderlord's adds a really boring damage spike on applying three instances of damage and Grasp rewards you for brawling.\n\nA real defensive keystone could be, for example, a directional shield - think Fiora's passive, but instead of extra damage, it reduces damage coming in from the direction of the effect. It even could be something that works against all damage or only specific damage types...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Morticianjohn","date":"2016-08-15T04:13:09.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I do think it's a better system than the other, however, maybe just tweak some of the keystones.

Previously, you would just dump 21 point in offense because it was just better, and literally everyone other than supports ran 21/9/0. This way, you can run much more unique mastery sets depending on your champion and your playstyle. Obviously some champs are much better with certain keystones, but you can adapt somewhat depending on the matchup.\n\nThe issue is that riot has simply allowed them to be 110% OVERPOWERED AS FUCK FOR NEARLY A YEAR. There are no tradeoffs in build paths, because you can just get damage from your  keystone and build full tank and faseroll people. If riot just sits down for 5 fkin minutes and figures out how to balance the free damage from the keystones (ie make them scale instead of just being free flat damage) they should work fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"metaworldpeace10","date":"2016-08-15T06:22:35.529+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Fervor, TLD, DFT and Grasp need some serious work IMO, if not flat out removal.
