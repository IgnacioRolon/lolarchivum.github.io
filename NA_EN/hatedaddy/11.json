This is aimed at helping you improve your odds of getting a rioter to post in your thread, the hopes and dreams of every small child when they become a forum browser and poster. It's important to note, this guide helps you understand how you can improve your chances of gaining rioter attenrion and potentially a post, I cannot under any circumstance give you advice that will assuredly lure them in to post. Aside from this information I am about to provide, remember they are all white and live on the west coast so at the very least, you can always make a generic thread about your favorite coffee from Starbucks and you'll likely get a red post. However, this isn't something that gets their attention for a desired topic. \n\nGood luck on the forums, summoners!\n\n____________________________\n#Critical Steps\n\nIt's important to follow these steps in some semblance of order. As i stated before, Rioters have displayed the capacity to use free thinking and independent will so they've become a very unpredictable creature. However, using these stats collected from Lyte, these are the best ways to get rioter attention with a strong probability of a red post. \n\nStep 1: Addressing Rioters by their appropriate departments\n\nThis is important. It is a very good method to gain rioter attention by directly addressing a single red. However, asking Morello where the fuck the east coast servers are at is likey not going to get a response from him. His department is titled as I.R.E.L.I.A, better know as the International Reforming Efforts Limiting Irelia's Abilities, or the balance department, fampus for nerfing. And the occasional buffing. Make sure you know which rioter to address for the appropriate topic little Billy, otherwise your chances for getting attention from them are slim.\n\nStep 2: Make sure your topic has thorough research with an approachable title and first post.\n\nFor example, expecting a rioter to post to a thread \"lol fk u riot u stupid fks\" is pretty unrealistic. If you have any beef with riot and you'd like to express dissatisfaction, the best way to go about this is making a post titled at vaguely mentioning your concerns and then using the OP as a detailed and vivid depiction of what your complaints are. This isn't the best way and remember directly addressing a rioter is ideal, however this way you don't risk getting banned my the mods and their urge to show their mom they have power on the Internet.\n\nStep 3: Show why a rioter should take you seriously\n\nOn a topic with an informative base and a thread aimed at disagreeing with a certain direction by riot, make it clear what separates you from the average poster. If you are a filthy freelo abusing Anivia main and you think she needs buffs for some reason, you should point this out. But realize I will call you a brain damaged child who had cinder blocks dropped on your head as a child for making such a request. But that's not important, what is important is to realize The Red needs to know why they should take you seriously. If you don't, they will continue to sit around in their offices and throw old used Starbucks cups at each other.\n\nStep 4: The Last Resort: The cliche troll thread\n\nIf you are desperate for red attention and don't care about the topic, you can always look to be smited. Ask the rioter why you got chat restricted for 700 games even though you know you're a fucking asshole. But remember this isn't important, what's important is getting publicly smited and thinking this makes you cool for some reason. You can also try baiting them out by making threads such as \"I downvote every red I see post,\" or some silly thread aimed at a few laughs like this. Remember little Tommy, red posts in your threads is pretty much the same thing as graduating from Harvard with a PHD. Your mother will be proud.\n\n______________________\n#Questions and Answers Section\n\nQ: \"but HateDaddy, I really am not that toxic! I was only banned for 6 years and I don't understand why! What the heck? Help me!\"\n\nWell Little Eric, it's because you're a douche bag and calling your teammates feeding idiots and using racial and homosexual slurs towards them will get you banned. Improve your behavior and perhaps you can get a red post in a more positive light!\n\nQ \"HateDaddy, I made a thread wanting to get attention from Phreak and it was supposed to be funny. But he didn't respond, what do I do?\"\n\nWell little Erin, sometimes rioters simply don't respond and that's the chance we take. Phreak in particular is very busy and typically doesn't respond but if you want his attention, make a thread that solves the crisis of receding hairlines with maximum tons of damage. This could work. Good luck!\n\nQ \"blady facking hell HateDaddy, ur a fooking blady yank wanker n I bet me mum id slap the shit out Ye blady Mouf u dirty yank, get off me boards. Bollocks\"\n\nA: riot give these guys their own general discussion back please. We've got enough brain damage around here.\n\nQ: \"Thanks for the help HateDaddy! When I get a rioter to post in my thread, I'm going to credit you!\"\n\nA: Ah that won't be necessary! Keep up the hard work and claim your rewards for yourself, young man! It's important to enjoy the thugs you've worked for and a red post is better than winning the lottery. Good luck! \n\n___________________\n\nThis concludes this guide. As always, feel free to ask questions and I'll address them accordingly. Thanks again for your time and potential posts Summoners, good luck!","replies":[]}
