In Ekko's case it puts you in just enough range to press E.\n\nDoesn't matter if it's a luxury item lol. It does its job well enough that if you're winning a lane, you win lane even harder if you decide to go the {{item:3027}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3152}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3135}}  path.","replies":[{"poster":"CeexSett","date":"2016-08-23T15:09:12.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly, it's a snowball item.

This lets me 2v1 super easily on most abusive champs. Hell, if I'm fed I can 4v1 thanks to exhaust.  If the super fed mid laner runs up I can just press exhaust on him and go back to shitting on the jungler/top/support/ then kill the mid that's yelling in all chat to report his noob team. \n\nI think people have spent so long circle jerking {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:12}}  as the must have summoner set up that they actually forgot other shit exists, and is arguably more powerful in the current meta, especially in NA where everyone plays champs they're mechanically terrible at and don't even know how to trade with. If they fuck up even once to a laner with exhaust they die. And the beauty about it is, exhaust is going to be right back up just before your ulti anyways. So you'll probably kill him yet again. And again. And again. And again. And again.  This is what makes {{champion:157}}  really cancerous to fight since a lot of them take exhaust now, which makes any chance of fighting him impossible if he ever gets a lead, or scales up.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"jama655","date":"2016-08-23T13:57:37.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but......hes melee...i swear....","replies":[]},{"poster":"redfeenix","date":"2016-08-22T19:56:25.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Too late gnar's about to get nerfed to the fucking ground along with all the other meta lcs picks like reksai, gragas ash jinx and sivir. \n\nThats too much a sensible and safe nerf, and just not riots style.
