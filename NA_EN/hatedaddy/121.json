It&#039;s about changing unhealthy play styles or generic kits that do everything. On a grander scale, for class reworks, it&#039;s about changing a large pool of champions that suffer from abusive interactions with itemization, weak synergies in need of updating, infrequent niches and various other reasons to name a few examples. \r\n\r\nWhen these reworks happen, the initial goal isn&#039;t to gut a champion, to make them stronger or anything like that. It&#039;s to make it so Riot can make broad changes without fear of certain champions abusing said changes. People talk about all the class reworks being a failure and maybe some of them have yielded some less than desirable results for certain champions. In those cases, that&#039;s probably a good thing because it just shows those champions required isolated attention. In the larger scheme though, those changes produced better itemization, healthier gameplay and stronger diversity.\r\n\r\nPeople will likely go nuts and point to &quot;failures&quot; such as Malz, Morde, etc. To which I&#039;ll point to you Darius, Vlad (who I initially hated but once I played and got familiar with playing against I love), Swain, etc. More importantly, black cleaver became a staple item across the board in the juggernaut patch. AP itemization has greatly diversified since the mage update as opposed to stack as much AP/CDR as you can, assassins got their own items. ADCs overall got more diverse and less generic right clickers. In the big picture, these updates made the game better. Yes, some cases sucked and some will need to be looked at but riot isn&#039;t perfect - neither are you. But for those that are &quot;weak&quot; from these reworks, guess what riot can finally do now? *Buff them without fear of breaking them.* \r\n\r\nTanks might be good, they might be bad - I don&#039;t know. It&#039;s going to take a few patches before we know for sure. But by the end of the season, I can promise you that overall, once Riot figured it out, tanks will definitely be healthier and better overall.  And that&#039;s the ultimate goal of class updates and in my mind, they&#039;ve been extremely successful.","replies":[{"poster":"BobaFlautist","date":"2017-05-12T01:21:17.506+0000","up_votes":56,"down_votes":5,"body":"That's fine.

If it turns out that a champions update in a class update isn't good or feels less satisfying, then it's clear that champion need individual attention. It sucks for your main, I don't dispute this but this is always a chance you take when you religiously main a champion. Nobody likes it or likes to talk about it but in the long run, especially with older champions, it's inevitable that they'll experience some sort of rework along the way.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2017-05-12T04:55:29.795+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":8,"body":">I understand your point but I addressed this in the OP.

Typical example of a sunk costs fallacy. It's not worth wasting more resources than you already have trying to fix something you broke. It's better just to restart it to the last point where it worked.\n\nTo be honest though I've never seen a company fall harder for the sunk costs fallacy than Riot does. They're unwilling to let even their worst work \"go to waste\". This is why we had DQ forced down out throats for a whole year last year and Riot still refuses to admit it's a shit queue despite it being a dead queue with 15 minute waits and super uneven matches because no-one wants it.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2017-05-12T05:42:51.633+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":10,"body":"See, here's the difference between you and Riot. *You* see the Rework as a failure. *They* see the rework as needing some work. That's not a bad thing, lots of projects are hardly \"Boom, Fixed\". You also need to define what your definition of \"Last worked\" and what their's is. They rework for many a reason, both parties could be looking at different reasons. \n\nNow, I don't disagree with you here, but I don't agree with you either, simply because you are looking through a very *Customer Point of View*. You see a product you don't like, so you don't want it. Easy, simple, no effort involved. All the power to you. \n\nRiot is a Business, and Business's have a very different view point on everything, and this is worth mentioning. Let's use McDonalds and Minimum wage as an example. From a customer view point, asking for a dollar more minimum wage seems fairly insignificant, very small. But it's not for McDonalds, because they look at the very long term situations. \n\nThey look at 5 to 10 to 20 year plans in how they can make money. While a one dollar raise may seem insignificant now, in ten years, that could be a very large amount of money lost. It also works the same way with new products, or new machinery. They may take a hit for this year in revenue, but buying new machines could increase their revenue by 20% over the following years, so it's worth the initial hit to make more. \n\nSo this is where I disagree with people when they say \"DQ should've been reverted ASAP\", because that's a very customer based view. A year to **try** and fix a new system, even if it meant that they may take a hit the current year, is well worth the effort if it is able to achieve a better system that will be better throughout the years (be it Revenue or Ranked matchmaking, your choice).  \n\nNow, it didn't work as we see now, but for a business a year is hardly anything when it comes to trying something new, if it has potential for making something better. It didn't, and that's not the point here, but scrapping without any attempt at fixing is a faulty way to test out new things.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2017-05-12T07:33:11.798+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":">Riot is a Business, and Business's have a very different view point on everything, and this is worth mentioning.

But it's not for McDonalds, because they look at the very long term situations.\n\nThat's not really an equivalent example TBH. It's never in McDonald's interest to raise wages unless forced, it's very easy to imagine scenarios where both reverting and not reverting reworks. They also wouldn't really be changing the product at all in the same way Riot has.\n\nAlso the idea that McDonalds would pass the expense of a raised minimum wage onto consumers is already shaky in the first place. In Australia McDonalds is cheaper than in America and we have an 18.70 AUD min wage. McDonalds just has to operate at a lower margin in Australia than in the USA, if they tried to raise their prices they'd lose marketshare to other fast food restaurants they can't lower their wages from what they are now. But that's fairly tangential anyway.\n\nI'd say a fairer example here would be \"new Coke\". Coke at one point tried to change their formula and it was an utter dumpster fire. Over a couple of months they lost almost all of their marketshare to Pepsi. They were quick to bring back old Coke when public perception turned against them damned be the costs they sunk into developing new Coke.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2017-05-12T07:57:35.774+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":12,"body":"It wasn't meant to be a literal example, it was meant to show the long term thinking of Companies. \n\nAnd no, I wouldn't compare either New Coke to this either. \"New Coke\" was meant to compete with Pepsi, a much sweeter drink, and you're right, they failed and it got switched back. **However**, you can't hoist the same time span on this to be considered an absolute failure and then reverted, as you can with League. \n\nFor one, Coca Cola had a *much faster* reaction to their product going down. If you were to take a Survey of it, the type of people who drink Cola drink Coke because it's Coke. They don't want Pepsi, they want Coke, it's just their thang. Coke and Pepsi are fairly different enough they don't overlap in customer base ~~unless you're that guy~~. So if people who normally drink Coke aren't drinking Coke, that's a big problem. \n\nDynamic Que was no where near the type of immediate reaction, because League of Legends is still a fairly big and unique enough product that they could afford a temporary hit. The Food industry is much more competitive, especially back then, where any lead was a big one. \n\nThat, and not to mention the true fact, that there was a fairly decent sized amount of people who enjoyed Dynamic Que. Unlike food, and we're using a singular product size, you can have a varied amount of people who enjoy different aspects of a game. Food is pretty \"Get what you buy\", which very limited room for varied opinion. Riot wants to try to appeal to the largest amount of people, not singular groups. \n\nSo unlike Coke, who had had a HUGE immediate reaction with the Market, which was what prompted the revert, League did not have that. It's because they did not have that, that they decided to go the Year long trial route, and take the small hit in the hopes that they could make a better system. There is a huge difference between the two.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2017-05-12T08:32:35.549+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":">That, and not to mention the true fact, that there was a fairly decent sized amount of people who enjoyed Dynamic Que.\n\nNo, there weren't. Riot wanted you to think there were and they tried to tell you there were but there simply weren't that many people who actually liked DQ. You can test this as well, considering DQ essentially still exists in the game. Go and queue up for a Flex Queue game, watch how long it takes, when you get a game look at well match making performs. Both of these will be abysmal. There just aren't that many people who want Flex Queue compared to Normals and Solo Queue.\n\nRiot bought heavily into the sunk costs fallacy with DQ. They were hurting themselves and they knew it. They went full damage control mode for about 6 months, [let's not forget that this happened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwPa1SGLGv0). \n\nThe point of sunk costs as a fallacy is that it's attractive to look at your work and say \"it can be fixed with X/Y/Z\" then after attempting that and failing to move the goalposts and try again. Losing all of your work isn't meant to look like attractive option even when it's the correct one. \n\nThe difference between Riot and Coke is that Coke accepted that their sunk costs were lost, they took the path that offered the least future damage and didn't sink anymore resources trying to fix the unfixable. Riot bought into the sunk costs fallacy hook-line-and-sinker. They continued to pour resources into their failing queue and continued trying to push it even though they knew it was widely despised.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-05-12T00:30:50.943+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":20,"body":"but they didnt rework tanks... they changed 3 champs that are tanks...","replies":[{"poster":"Variks the Loyal","date":"2017-05-12T00:44:15.565+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":2,"body":"By that logic, they didn't rework Juggernauts either, since none of the other ones received massive changes. {{champion:75}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:2}}","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-05-12T00:48:28.111+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":14,"body":"but they actually have made more changes to juggernauts then they did tanks... \n\nand shy has been changed twice, udry has a rework coming up.","replies":[{"poster":"Variks the Loyal","date":"2017-05-12T00:51:18.389+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the subsequent patches you mean?

On top of that, we think we could expand even further on what it means to be League’s shape-changing, bouncy, goo-man.\n\n> Here’s what is likely to change with Zac:\n\n> Zac’s current kit encourages him to activate all his abilities in a single burst for maximum damage, instead of spreading them out to disrupt and bounce around the enemy team\n\n> After initiation, there is very little variance or mastery to his combat pattern, consisting of primarily sitting on one target and spamming his Q and W\n\n> Keeping in line with our overall Tank update goals, we’d like to shift some his reliable damage into additional forms of CC (we already felt that his two passives provide unique forms of defenses)\n\n> Although some of his abilities hit the mark, we feel that his kit could further stretch the blob man fantasy and give him a more distinct sticky feel in the Vanguard space\n\n> Stretching Strike does little to explore the stretching punch idea and ends up having a very similar output to Unstable Matter (AoE damage when you’re right next to someone)\n\n> Let’s Bounce! is a more chaotic version of Wukong’s Ultimate (Cyclone) rather than the potential teamfight-defining moment that Zac’s unique, sticky, bouncy nature promises\n\n> We’re looking to turn our resident goo-man into the premier displacement Vanguard, shuffling his opponents around the battlefield with sticky, stretchy, chaotic abilities that feel uniquely Zac.","replies":[{"poster":"Atanchan","date":"2017-05-12T19:10:24.040+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"tl;dr \"he's basically a sunfire cape with some mild disruption after he uses his E\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"SexyBabyJesusZ","date":"2017-05-12T20:17:42.841+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=cocacolalips,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6bnukc5n,comment-id=00080000,timestamp=2017-05-12T15:19:34.557+0000)\n>\n> does no one read the patch notes - update notes?\n> \n> https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/vLEjALxZ-mid-season-tanks-update-zac\n\nhe was 100% fine, there was no need to change him and his playstyle.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Very Hard Engage","date":"2017-05-12T03:08:04.369+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":12,"body":"yeah, gutting, we get it.\n{{champion:45}} {{champion:3}}{{champion:143}}  {{item:3070}} \n","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2017-05-12T03:15:07.979+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"Galio gutted LUL","replies":[{"poster":"ForeverLaxx","date":"2017-05-12T11:15:02.282+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Galio was removed and replaced with an imposter.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-05-12T13:40:34.226+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea i agree ... the new champ is cool but its not galio","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sraeg2013","date":"2017-05-12T14:11:50.670+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Galio was removed.
