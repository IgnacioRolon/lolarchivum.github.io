See, at first she was played as a bruiser in top lane making us top lane mains saltier than an ocean beach on high tide. But then people realized AP Nidalee was even more cancer and took her mid lane. It took the better half of two years for Riot to finally kill this playstyle and relieve the mid lane mains of this cancer. But then, after a trip to the oncologist, it was revealed us top lane mains contracted the cancer panther once again after a rework. Ah, the memories of chemo and having been hit by a spear or step on a trap and watch our screen suddenly go grey. But then with much rigor and determination, we survived bruiser cancer Panther once again.\r\n\r\nAfter riot nerfed this abomination, they felt their creation was a little too special to just &quot;go away.&quot; So they decided the jungle needed it&#039;s fair share of cancer, as if battling the Lee Sin terminal fate for 3 years wasn&#039;t bad enough. And now she&#039;s in your jungle, cancering you up and making you rage at every turn and fellas, I&#039;m right there with you. I&#039;m tired of Nidalee being shoved down our throats but it seems Riot thinks we must eat our cake and then die to Nidalee for having the audacity to want to clear, gank or otherwise enjoy the game. And I am truly sorry for this as I feel your pain and if there&#039;s anything I can do to help comfort you through these trying times, let me know.\r\n\r\nYour friend, your ally, your mate\r\n\r\n-Top Lane main \r\n\r\nWard that bush though, would ya?","replies":[{"poster":"Morgy Morgy","date":"2015-07-19T01:35:43.596+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":7,"body":"fuck nidalee man\nnidalee is the only champion besides ryze that riot ALWAYS wants viable.\nno nerfs to them ever. atleast, no nerfs significant enough to make them unviable.\nfuck nidalee\nsick of this shit\nstop being pussies and nerf the bitch","replies":[{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2015-07-19T01:40:10.323+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":12,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=0MGW4LRU5,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=4c0uaEbx,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-07-19T01:35:43.596+0000)\n>\n> fuck nidalee man\n> nidalee is the only champion besides ryze that riot ALWAYS wants viable.\n> no nerfs to them ever. atleast, no nerfs significant enough to make them unviable.\n> fuck nidalee\n> sick of this shit\n> stop being pussies and nerf the bitch\n\nThere was quite a decent length of time prior to the creation of Jungle Nidalee that she wasn't in the spotlight.

Bruiser Nid was killed in 4.17 and jungle Nid came into existence in 5.2. There were seven (maybe) patches there, which amounts to a bit more than three months of being out of the meta.\n\nIt's not the biggest gap a champion has ever had between stints in the meta, no, but it did happen. There are other champs I'd complain about more regarding being a constant meta presence.\n\nHonestly I think Jungle Nidalee was Riot's attempt to make her relevant without making people rage. Obviously it didn't work out very well, but I imagine they thought her laning phase was the main reason people hated her, so taking her out of a lane might help. But I imagine she'll get nerfed again soon anyway, a lot of people would consider her the best jungler in the game and considering you know, the endless bile that gets thrown in her direction, they're not just going to ignore her.\n\nWhether they nerf her into irrelevancy or not, who knows. Their initial Jungle Nid nerfs were pretty tame.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Narasimha","date":"2015-07-19T15:51:02.606+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"> She's always strong somewhere, if she isn't for a brief period, Riot ensures she is.\n\nJust to jump in, you're a SLIGHT bit off. It'd be more accurate to say \"She's always decent somewhere.\" Because what she is is another jack-of-all trades.
