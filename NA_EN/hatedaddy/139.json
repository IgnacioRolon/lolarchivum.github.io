She controls the pace of the lane and takes away the agency of her laner by constantly zoning (specifically against melee champs). \n\nA lot of the hate for Orianna revolves around her high amount of both damage and utility. A lot of other comments in the thread so far speak to her low ult cooldown and how it is often used as a nuke and that the cc it provides is just icing on the cake. Something has to change. Either lower her damage or her utility. Nerfing her damage seems to be the concensious from what I'm seeing. \n\nRiot has taken a stance as of recently for being against generalist picks. Orianna is the definition of a generalist pick for mages.
