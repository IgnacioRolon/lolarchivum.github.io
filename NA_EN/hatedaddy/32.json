No seriously, with each passing patch, you continue to display the unwillingness to do anything to help immobile melee champions when there's several easy solutions that would reduce the strengths of over mobile champions, both range and melee alike, and strengthen the power of immobile melee champions while keeping both gameplay and counterplay well within reach. But you don't care, you aren't concerned with this. Your concerns are clear: releasing tons of new champions with hyper mobility, hard CC, insane damage and random utility galore with limited resource costs, if any costs at all. Props on Bard though, he actually seems cool and has weaknessss with decision making being important, unlike your last God knows how many new releases.\r\n\r\nWhy am I upset? Why does this suck for me? You continue to shove ranged top laners down our throats. Right now, on PBE, Ryze has buffs that are basically reverting his nerfs. Yes I'm aware this is PBE and its not final. But the fact that you're even considering this baffles me when we have evidence from the last 4 seasons what happens when you buff him. He breaks top lane until he's nerfed and becomes trash tier after that because his design is broken as fuck and you refuse to rework him in any meaningful way, instead you buff and nerf him in cycles and keep him broken until worlds so you can have him dominate them for some reason, I have no clue why. You know what happens when you do this and you don't care. Kennen is already strong, Irelia is getting nerfed so one of Ryzes hardest lane match ups in top is going away while he's being buffed. You don't care. You don't care about my experience at all.\r\n\r\nLet me tell you exactly what's going to happen if this goes through for Ryze. He will instantly be a strong top laner, he will be strong as hell. He will still rush RoA and FH vs AD tops and SV vs AP tops then he will build righteous glory afterwards which will increase his damage spike and durability. You won't nerf him, instead you'll nerf righteous glory because of him even though it was intended to be an item to help some of the less mobile melee champions. \r\n\r\nAt this point I'm convinced you literally couldn't care less about how we feel and that's fine. This is your game after all. But for 3 seasons in a row now, I've watchdd everything designed to help melee champions get nerfed (early MR, armor items, anti kite items etc) while you randomly throw us insignificant bones then nerfing it anyway. You've done nothing but stick a big middle finger at me and I've tried to be understanding realizing there aren't easy solutions out there but guess what? You're sticking it to me and the champs I play again just by considering this.\r\n\r\nI realize this will be downvote spammed and fine, fair enough. I'm frustrated. Im frustrated as hell. And I realize this will go ignored and even if it's not and some rioter does post, it will be a generic ass response that seems like its some automated response that's along the lines of \"We are sorry for not communicating, we suck at communication, we want to get better at communication and it won't happen again\" and then that'll be all it is.\r\n\r\nI'm honestly at the point where I want to quit this game and I hate saying that because I love it. But I've received nothing  but \"fuck you and your champions\" from riot from every department of their team from balancing to new champions that it's clear to me that sooner or later, it's just not worth me playing this game anymore expecting anything otherwise.","replies":[{"poster":"Raptamei","date":"2015-03-16T23:27:26.497+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":78,"body":"Okay, so melee dps isn't viable anymore.

Rek'sai, Jarvan, Lee Sin, Nidalee, and Vi will just bounce over a wall after stealing a camp and that's the end of that. And that will happen all game long.

Could you explain more about this? Because there are \"easy\" ways to solve the problem with hyper mobility. Also, Riot is not releasing many champions currently, they are slowing down trying to fix the problems. \n\n>Why am I upset?...\n\nRyze is being reworked right now. While this buff is way too big IMO, they have on their watch to do something about Ryze's oppressiveness. Also, Irelia's nerf won't hit her until level 8, and at that point is only 10 less damage. She will have 0 problems against Ryze still. While they care about your experiences, they also care about Ryze players, who have had to use an extremely weak champion for a long time now. \n\n>At this point...\n\nDoran's shield reducing single target magic damage help melees to deal with range, while not too much. Ryze in particular gets all his spells reduced by Doran's Shield. While nerfing early MR was a wrong move, I think that immobile melees shouldn't have much problem against Ryze if they manage to play/build against him well.\n\n>I realize this will be downvote spammed...\n\nFirst of all, you are going with the circlejerk. You know that pretty well. It is me who will be downvoted even though I am trying to explain everything as best as I can. Second, Riot has done a great job lately. Response for patch 5.4 was terrible, and they are working hard to fix that mistake (look at patch 5.5 and 5.6, tons of buffs for champions and nerfing the stronger ones).\n\n> I'm honestly at the point where I want to quit this game...\n\nDunno what to say, this is just random ranting.","replies":[{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2015-03-17T17:21:54.167+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's nonesense and you know it, why do you pretend to have read nothing of the post's arguments ??\n\nFirst point: He mentions Riot's intention of Righteous Glory being an immobile melee helping item, now Ryze being buffed mean he will take advantage of it and get it nerfed, because he somewhat falls under the immobile category. From Riot's recent behavior in terms of balance changes ( such as {{item:3100}} nerf and DFG's removal ) his fears are accurate, the item; which helps against mobile champions {{item:3800}}  will get nerfed instead of the broken champion that is {{champion:13}}.\n\n\nPoint two: Oh really? Ryze is being reworked so we buff him? Even though his kit is cancerous? What about these guys? {{champion:78}} {{champion:83}} that have been denied buffs for eternity ? Ryze on the other hand has been viable so many times over the seasons, he by no means deserves these buffs. That being said, having a counter to a champion =/=  that champion is balanced. Toplane Ryze invalidates over half the toplane roster and OUTSCALES them as a ranged champion, and that is beyond ridiculous.\n\n\nPoint 3: Doran's shield is a lane survival item, it does not help fighting Ryze like {{item:1055}} does nor does it block his E. If he naturally outscales them then there is no point in playing a stall game, you have to risk roaming or getting a kill on him. Defensive stats won't help that.\n\nIncidentally, guess what would help against him? {{item:3800}}. But how will you use it against him if he causes the item to get nerfed? Or even if you do, he will have it too. Then we will have the {{item:3068}} design argument and Riot will nerf it because of #diversity.\n\n4: Because the past 7-9 patches were terrible and now we have 1 or 2 patches that are good, does not automatically mean Riot has improved their ways. God only knows what is going on at the balance HQ, as troll and unpredictable their balance/rework team is {{champion:103}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:432}}{{champion:45}} , I wouldn't count on them if they don't take community feedback consistently.\n\n5: This is not random ranting, learn to have compassion to fellow summoners. Of course you wouldn't feel anything if you don't experience what he has been going through. These are the feelings conveyed by the previous and upcoming balance changes that leave one in confusion and frustration of Riot's balancing policy. If anything is random right now, it is Riot's behavior.

The problem is that CC actually counters immobile champions more than mobile champions, as it makes it so easy to punish immobile champions for even slightly bad positioning.  No one thinks of Leona as a counter to Lucian or Graves, but everyone knows not to play Ashe or Varus into a Leona lane, as it is too easy to get ulted and chain CCed.  Further, disengage CC counters immobile champions way more than mobile champions.  The end result is that CC designed to counter mobility actually ends up screwing over immobile champions even more.  As more and more champions have CC and mobility, immobile champions find themselves outclassed more and more.  \n\nThis is true of stuns, but it is even more true of slows.  Slowing a champion with a leap or dash or other mobility skill doesn't really reduce their mobility that much, as they can still use their mobility skill.  But slowing a champion without a mobility skill is often times just as good as stunning them.  This is all part of the uneven playing field immobile champions find themselves in.\n\nMobility is an issue, and I think at some level Riot does acknowledge it.  There has to be a very real concern that if more and more champions with mobility are available, champions without mobility may find less and less room in team comps.\n\nIt may well be that there are network effects going on here.  Late game, where one player getting caught out can be death, isn't a team only as mobile as its least mobile player?  Bard's effect on this may be fascinating if he ever sees competitive play.  It's possible that he will enable immobile champions to be played more, but it's also possible he will just further exacerbate the issue, as an immobile champion will have literally zero chance of running away from a team with a bard.\n\nOP is mainly looking at immobile melee champions, but there's another related issue involving a class of champions that has as many issues as immobile bruisers: immobile skill shot mages.  These champions lose effectiveness the more enemies have mobility.  At one end of the spectrum, it becomes nearly impossible to land slow skill shots on hyper mobile champions like Kalista.  For example, trying to land Nami's bubble on Kalista is an exercise in futility, as she can keep hopping around as long as she has a target in range.  You basically have to guess which direction she is going to hop, but late game with enough attack speed she can sometimes hop twice before your bubble lands.  Slowing her doesn't even help, as movement speed slows don't actually reduce her mobility as long as she is attacking.\n\nThere is a form of CC that counters mobility skills more directly: silence.  Unfortunately, Riot does not seem to be a big fan of silence.  I can understand why, but the end result is that there is not currently any mechanic to counter mobility skills that doesn't disproportionately impact immobile champions.  Riot did give Soraka an AoE silence, but in doing so took away her point and click silence.  In general, Riot reworked her kit to be more skill shot reliant, just as they did with Veigar.  It's understandable why they are doing this, but skill shots are just another mechanic that is much more powerful against immobile champions than against mobile champions.\n\nI would love to see a champion that had an ability to disable mobility skills for x seconds in an area.  Alternatively, this could be an active on an item, although I really doubt Riot would go for that.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"terkmc","date":"2015-03-17T05:38:00.933+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"In a world of perfect balance, cc would counter mobile champion since they would have to give up something in their power budget to gain mobility, most likely loosing their survivalbilty.
