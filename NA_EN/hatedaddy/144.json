It happens. We lose lane sometimes, we get outplayed with absolutely nobody to blame but ourselves. And I get it, sometimes you gotta cut dead weight and try to salvage whatever you can by ganking for winning lanes where you have a reasonable chance to get kills. But there is a certain point as a jungler where you HAVE to do something about a losing lane if you want to win the game. Period. \n\nBefore anyone wants to jump on me and accuse me of this, I&#039;m not referring to losing lane myself and not getting help - I actually got some help and it was nice and I thanked the jungler. I stomped my lane but he was still ganking for me 20 minutes in when our bot lane was getting dove at inhib tower because the enemy Gragas camped them instead. He got mad at me because I told him he needs to stop coming top and do something about bot/mid and he goes on to flame our bot/mid lane for losing lane and it&#039;s not his fault. Well no, it&#039;s not your fault but damnit if you want to win, you HAVE to stop the enemy team from diving at our inhib turret when our tier 2 tower is still up, that simply can&#039;t happen. \n\nThis is probably where people say &quot;but omg top laner, why don&#039;t you do something!!&quot; I did, but I&#039;m a nasus and I need to get SOME farm. I teleported bot once but teleport ganks are a lot harder to pull off now and they got away. It stopped a dive and nobody died but I basically blew my TP to save bot. So I can only do so much and as a solo laner, I do have to spend most of my time laning, especially as a farm dependent champion. But this mentality pisses me off because junglers can do no wrong. And the Zac was smart to come top a few times but coming 4-5 times in a row while our bot is continuously getting dove is not smart and we&#039;re just going to lose the game by getting penta killed by their jinx if Zac doesn&#039;t pressure bot at all. And explaining this to him had him furious and he just kept flaming mid/bot for losing lane. \n\nAnd after the game he added my friend to tell him how much we suck and had a few more nasty things to say that I won&#039;t be repeating. But guess what the TL;DR is? \n\ntl;dr\n\nJunglers, you&#039;re not perfect and you&#039;re not immune from blame or responsibility. And you flame just as much as solo laners do, please everyone stop playing victim and quit being dicks and just play the game well so I don&#039;t have an aneurysm trying to climb.","replies":[{"poster":"Arthimetes","date":"2016-07-17T15:23:22.322+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I hate is when the lane is even, neither me or my enemy able to score a kill so we just farm, the enemy gets a gank and finally gets a kill so I ask my jungler for help only to get the infamous line;\n\n\"I don't help losing lanes\"\n\nSome junglers are so quick to throw that around I've even had some tell me that for being 10 cs behind.","replies":[{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2016-07-17T20:52:55.493+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Arthimetes,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rFUjbEGG,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2016-07-17T15:23:22.322+0000)\n>\n> What I hate is when the lane is even, neither me or my enemy able to score a kill so we just farm, the enemy gets a gank and finally gets a kill so I ask my jungler for help only to get the infamous line;\n> \n> &quot;I don&#x27;t help losing lanes&quot;\n> \n> Some junglers are so quick to throw that around I&#x27;ve even had some tell me that for being 10 cs behind.\n\nYeah that's oddly common.\n\nThat or the jungler who ganks when you tell them not to (because it's risky), ends up dying to the enemy laner and potentially gets me killed as well, and then rages at me when I told them that we couldn't fight it out/we were gonna ger ambushed.\n\nAnd then the enemy laner proxeeds to completely dominate me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Diananmen Square","date":"2016-07-17T20:10:41.779+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a jungle main and that statement is true at times, but definetly not in this case.

Of course, that's usually the jungler (although ADCs LOVE to blame their supports and vice versa).  It's complicated when there are two laners that are getting spanked, because then the jungler gets shit on by two people, and they'll just start group-flaming.\n\nIt's a difficult job to do, especially if you get more than  one laner that is outmatched in a game.  I'm not sure that I've played a game where my team hasn't absolutely DOMINATED where someone doesn't bitch about something, no matter how minor.  IMO, it gets better when you get into higher MMR games because those players tend to be more self-sufficient and expect less help in laning phase from the jungler.\n\nAnyhow, when I do get my off-role, I don't bitch at the jungler, and my expectation is that it's entirely up to me to win my lane, with or without help from the jungler.  I find that this attitude keeps me focused on improving my off-role (i'm not that good outside of jungling), and forces me to make better trades at the very least.  I also tend to buy pink wards and items that help me survive ganks/laning phase (like zhonya's or sterak's gage etc).","replies":[]},{"poster":"DevlinCrow","date":"2016-07-18T07:58:19.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a Fill main but mostly jungle.

No farm to speak of because he wasted his time fighting renekton and losing.\nI tell him I'm going to gank mid again because he's dead and coming top will just be wasting time\nhe didn't like that\nHoly shit he didn't like that.\nScreaming at me to hold his lane, I outright refuse because their fizz is pushed to our mid turret and is easy gold, but darius has now cracked and there's no stopping it. renekton was freezing. I don't have to hold a frozen lane.\nI tell him to sit back and soak xp, I gank mid and kill fizz yet again, and I hear that infamous \"an ally has been slain\" for a fourth time.\n\nWelp congratulations on reading this far. I'll let you in on a little secret; all of us were on discord together\n\nSorry all top laners, but if you're going 0/4 against renekton I'm not coming up there to help you. Not even if you're one of my best friends. That is irredeemable. He's now strong enough to kill both of us and at 5 minutes if you're doing that poorly take my krugs or something don't just let renekton farm kills on you. \n\ntl;dr\nIf you're going 0/4 at 5 minutes, I'm not coming up there to save you. Even if we ARE on a call with each other. It's just a free double kill for their laner.\nPsychologists, how do I deal with a delusional friend who thinks he can duel renekton 0/4?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dunkrius2g","date":"2016-07-18T00:12:40.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a top laner, i never flame my jungler. If i do jungle and i get flamed, they r just gettin muted. Simple as that and hope they get reported. If top sucked, o well nothing you can do about it.
