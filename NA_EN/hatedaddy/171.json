Whether it's too soon or not, well, fuck it.\n\nThat said, there's some things we shouldn't joke about. People who try to come on here and act like depression is fake and troll around about it saying \"ARGH betamales arghhhh,\" hey, that's actually not okay. It's a real thing. And the people suffering through it at its most severe rate are people you'd never know they were until: they kill themselves, attempt to kill themselves and fail or miraculously and statistically the least likely, search out for help. The irony is, the people who probably make these threads or statements are depressed themselves. \n\nThere's some things where you have to draw the line, much like the \"ARGH pull a damiya, kill urself etc.\" I don't pretend to be the most sensitive guy to certain things but again, we have to draw the line at some point. Dunno what motivated me to make this thread exactly, saw something the other day and it just kind of bothered me. But there, I said it. Flame away as I know some of you likely will.","replies":[]}
