This is because once he completes it, i no longer have a choice of whether I want to fight him or not. If he decides he wants to run me down and keep me perma slowed, he&rsquo;s going to. But I&rsquo;m not going to be able to stick to him because he will kite me infinitely as a melee champion. This is an illustration of the classic problem with melee vs ranged interactions. \r\n\r\nBy virtue of having range, ranged champions have an inherent advantage over melee champions, even melee champions with gap closers against immobile ranged champions. Why? Because the burden is always on the melee champion to engage on the ranged champion and this usually means they&rsquo;re going to eat quite a bit of damage just to do this. The ranged champion will get off unprovoked damage before the melee even lands their damage and that&rsquo;s dependent upon if they even can. Not to mention, even immobile ranged champions have tools to deal with mobile melee champions, often in the form of hard CC (and if it&rsquo;s skill shot hard CC, you&rsquo;re often awarded long ranged abilities as a result; if you&rsquo;re not long ranged, you&rsquo;ll generally have point and click CC). Of course these are generalizations, so there are obviously examples that contradict these but they are few and far between, thus insignificant to the discussion. \r\n\r\nSo what is the problem? The problem is that, as I&rsquo;ve mentionef, ranged champions already have tools to deal with melee champions diving them. In Viktors case, he has his cage that he drops and general longer range. And I don&rsquo;t mind that, it is a good interaction. If Viktor drops his cage properly, he wins. If he doesn&rsquo;t, he loses. It depends on the gameplay. What changes is that viktor buys {{item:3025}} and you&rsquo;ve suddenly removed a great deal of skill that it took for Viktor to work. Let&rsquo;s be honest, Viktor wasn&rsquo;t even a top tier champion prior to this. Now he is going to get nerfed and become even weaker in mid lane for abusing an item interaction that Riot refuses to address.\r\n\r\nThis interaction is ranged champions using items that were clearly intended for melee champions: {{item:3025}}{{item:3022}}; and even {{item:3116}} falls into this category because mages really **do not need** this item. Whenever it has been good, it has been abused to allow mages to avoid actually needing to land skill shots and simply perma slowing shit to death. Ranged champions abuse this interaction do hard and ultimately end up getting their intended play styles nerfed and the items themselves nerfed, actually hurting both the champions these items were designed to help as well as the champions original play styles. Let&rsquo;s be honest, there has never been a playstyle where ranged champions using these items as off-builds (and in some cases, normal builds) has been fun - it&rsquo;s always been incredibly toxic. And I am not interested in preserving blue Ez because that shit is one of the most toxic playstyles in the game. \r\n\r\nSo I&rsquo;ve presented my case and I&rsquo;ll make it simply. Make these items melee only. Ranged champions already have inherent tools to deal with divers, why are they allowed to abuse items intended for melee champions to circumnavigate that interaction and thus reduce their complexity while further increasing the complexity of melee champions? This is why champions like Aatrox, Irelia, Zed, Riven and Jax have to exist: it&rsquo;s the only consistent way to keep this bull-shit gap closed and even then, it&rsquo;s not closed because they all get nerfed into oblivion for doing what they were intended to. It needs to change.","replies":[{"poster":"Malak","date":"2018-10-29T17:53:50.633+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":4,"body":"All sounds great until you play {{champion:30}} and have no hard CC and easy to dodge skill shots that any mobile melee champion can outplay.","replies":[{"poster":"Quort","date":"2018-10-29T18:53:31.573+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":3,"body":"They don’t even really have to be mobile.

AP or AD.**\n\nThere should be value in health for AD champs and glass cannons, but should come at a sacrifice or an item that’s tuned around it. Cleaver, Sterak’s, and Mallet were fighter items that ranged picked up for various reasons and synergize with. Perhaps if they had their own designed it wouldn’t be as bad, so long as it’s tuned properly? I mean, GA was adapted to be an AD/armor item to help AD champs, and comes with lower AD. Perhaps similar could be done with health for them, at the cost of attack speed or crit? Mallet would likely not even be as bad on them if it hadn’t been for the slow, and Sterak’s shield gave them too much shield against assassin’s burst. It’s possible they could’ve been healthy with different passives.","replies":[{"poster":"U R Good At Game","date":"2018-10-30T04:01:48.184+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's called a tank item...

There are items in the game currently that give you little ad and high health yet NO ADC builds it. Your idea only works on paper. ADCs don&#x27;t want balanced hybrid items, they want to abuse bruiser items.\n\nOh really, higher health and lower AD = tank item? Not really, since tanks usually care little for damage and more for resists.\n\nAnd what items are those? Cleaver, Mallet, Sterak’s, etc. All the higher health/lower AD items are based around fighters, so your point that they don’t use them and “only want to abuse fighter items” doesn’t hold up, because the only ones right now are fighter items.\n\nBut take Lucian, Graves, and MF right now, although MF a bit less right now. If you adjust Cleaver to only be melee or something like that in this instance, these champs will be out a core item they seemingly needed. Now, they use the item far better than the intended users do, so it’s not really a bad idea. But, take it away and what do caster marksmen have? Essence Reaver, the lifesteal items, and not much else, especially since Caster Marksmen don’t use crit as well as other ADCs, but more CDR. That’s also why we had non-crit ADCs running BotRK, Cleaver, Mallet (Kindred). The rarely ran Cleaver before, so why did they change, and even with the nerfed AD and higher health, they still use it, mainly for the passives and likely the CDR. The passive nerf knocked out some Mallet ADCs. But if they synergize well with stats, is it not worth looking into if they would use a similar one, maybe Cleaver but lower health and higher AD, but with a different set of passives (make them mutually exclusive to each other)?\n\nedit: actually, on second thought of my post, bloodthirster and bortk don’t work as well on casters, since they auto less","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2018-11-01T21:34:47.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is a tank item when there is minimal ad and all the best parts of the item go to keeping the user alive because the stats are garbage in the first place despite being super expensive or as armor shred to set up another class.","replies":[{"poster":"Iota Theta","date":"2018-11-02T03:36:42.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LordGeovanni,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=g3sc2RZ2,comment-id=0001000100010000000100010001000000000000,timestamp=2018-11-01T21:34:47.583+0000)\n>\n> It is a tank item when there is minimal ad and all the best parts of the item go to keeping the user alive because the stats are garbage in the first place despite being super expensive or as armor shred to set up another class.\n\nThere’s a difference between a defensive item snd a tank item. Tank items typically carry more health and resists, no damage stats. Actually, not a single actual tank item carries AD or AP. A fighter item is a closer term, giving AD and Health, but anyone should be able to get defensive items. The biggest issue with a lot of ADC defensive items is, beyond GA, most are focused on auto attacks. If the AD champ is a caster, they can’t make as much use of the crit items, or of straight AS or lifesteal, so PD, Botrk, BT, QSS, and the like are trickier to use. That leaves the best options as GA, possibly Maw, and probably Death’s Dance for healing. Why can’t an AD caster also get a chunk of health at the cost of a bit of AD if they need to survive more","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2018-11-01T21:32:35.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ad GA benifited no one but adcs and assassins when other classes were also using the items not to mention that the item itself got several changes to make it un appealing to melee fighters and tanks like working off base hp when those same 2 classes have low base hp outside of a few outliers so that they are forced into building defensive items. and 300 base hp isnt alot to call the diffrence between a tank vs an assassin mage or adc in the first place.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Spank the Fox","date":"2018-10-29T22:51:57.626+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"“Squishies should stop complaining about being bursted if they build no defense”\n\n“Wait, no they can’t have X because it’s a tank/bruiser item!!!”\n\nIs HP a bruiser exclusive component?","replies":[{"poster":"U R Good At Game","date":"2018-10-29T23:50:49.677+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes.
