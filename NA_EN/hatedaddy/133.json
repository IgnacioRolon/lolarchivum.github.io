You&#039;re just going to keep nerfing him until his cooldowns are too high, his mana costs are too high and his base damages are too low. You&#039;ll basically be doing exactly what you did to old GP during meta golem where you kept constantly nerfing him. The difference is, I don&#039;t think he needs these nerfs. It won&#039;t change anything, he will still be picked in almost every competitive game. \r\n\r\nI play GP and I can tell you the biggest problems with him are his bonus gold passive on his Q and his Q applying melee bandit gold. With these two things, he farms up so much gold just by existing. Even if he&#039;s getting zoned for a wave or two, he&#039;s still collecting some gold. And that&#039;s rare a champion can do that to be honest. He can sit back and just keep a barrel behind him and clear waves this way and not interact. There&#039;s nothing that can be done about that, GP will be a safe farmer no matter what. GPs ult will provide great zone control in teamfights no matter what. GP basically already has a free ticket to late game but I don&#039;t think you should complete remove his ability to have lane presence and make him a non interactive farmer either because that playstyle is extremely unhealthy.\r\n\r\nWhat needs to be done is removing his bonus gold passive on Q and changing how his Q works with masteries like grasp and bandit, these are clearly ranged spells granting melee benefits and this shouldn&#039;t be the case. His Q&#039;s gold passive is what makes him impossible to shut down. Even when you have large leads by 2-3 kills on him, at best you&#039;re slightly ahead in gold. Between his barrels, ult and orange, snowballing on GP is almost impossible. And that shouldn&#039;t be a thing for a champion that scales so hard into late game. And these nerfs don&#039;t change that, they&#039;re just going to force him to be more farm heavy and non interactive and players will feel like they can&#039;t do anything to stop the GP train from going full force late game. \r\n\r\nMake him able to actually lose a lane significantly enough that he has to consider something other than farming two waves to make back up whatever deficit he had. This would be a much better change than what you&#039;re doing right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2016-08-22T19:24:23.295+0000","up_votes":48,"down_votes":2,"body":"But he's a scumbag pirate, plundering gold is central to his theme.

But I don't think this is going to change a thing because he's still going to afk farm and be ahead by virtue of being able to farm simply because of his Q passive. And I think ultimately, good changes would be to take away global range on his ults first two ranks and remove his passive gold gain. I think these two changes would be much more meaningful nerfs and you wouldn't have to keep hitting his kits numbers.

GP's is a bit more trackable since you can keep an eye on his Silver Serpent stash, but even there it shows that he's easily getting a Gold lead on anyone unless you have a significant CS advantage.\n\nIn GP's case I am more worried over his lane pattern, though. He basically is weak to all-in (even there, oranges help mitigate being caught out) but his barrel mechanic allows him to stand in Africa and still effectively farm due to the large range. He gets a movement speed bonus to boot, so trading with him after he blows a barrel on you becomes a tough sell due to his movement speed bonus and your movement speed penalty.\n\nI think rather than his ult damage, I'd rather see the ult size nerfed. It's such a huge circle for an untelegraphed global ult, and it effectively zones the entire enemy team. Therein lies his ult's problem: Rumble's Equaliser is hailed as a great zoning tool, but Gangplank's ultimate is far easier to land and can be used from anywhere on the map.\n\nI always ban Gangplank when I can simply because I am not good enough at ADC to handle his cannon barrage allowing Leona's easy engages.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2016-08-24T00:34:14.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with this, gold generation creates serious item lead problems that are difficult to balance around, especially in the laning phase. Gangplank is especially difficult to deal with because his other abilities allow him to play with more safety than many other top laners, which goes back to his old issues of eking out lane victories through gold generation advantages rather than more interesting engages. While it was a nice touch to keep his plundering theme, it might be better to just cut out the gold generation portion and leave him with his Silver Serpents mechanic.\n\nI think his barrels are, in most circumstances, more or less okay, but what I especially dislike about them is how unpredictable they can be for both Gangplank and his opponent. Crit interaction could be fun, but not in an environment when crits are purely RNG-dependent, and placing so much power on what is essentially random chance screws everyone over (Gangplank can miss a juicy amount of farm simply because he didn't get the crit he needed to last-hit every minion at once, but squishies can find themselves get blown up with 1k+ crit damage barrels). I'm also not the biggest fan of their early health, which can be bypassed by Gangplank by spawning an early barrel next to him and using it to detonate subsequent ones. Not sure how this could get fixed, but revising how they get detonated and how much of a real chance opponents have at disabling them early on could also help him be less of a lane bully (taking down barrels is usually a false choice for melee champions, for example, who are much more liable to just have it detonate in their face).","replies":[{"poster":"Dessem","date":"2016-08-24T08:44:41.067+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> his old issues of eking out lane victories through gold generation advantages rather than more interesting engages. \n\nThat's also certainly a thing. In most lanes, you have three basic states:\n\n1) You kill your opponent or have superior trades, forcing him to back and you to gain a Gold lead.\n\n2) You go even with your opponent, meaning you have similar CS and Gold values.\n\n3) You are defeated by your opponent and have a Gold disadvantage.\n\nin Gangplank's case, it's much more difficult to achieve #2, because Gangplank *naturally* has a Gold lead on you. You need to actually deny him CS in order to be on even footing with him. (Same goes with TF.) That's a ridiculous proposition: given 100 CS on both sides, neither side should have an advantage over the other for simply existing.

TF has a burst pattern with really low actual burst, and so mostly needs to gank other lanes at opportune moments to make use of his early gold lead. Morde is Morde, so playing him in a duo lane is pretty much punishment in itself, even with the XP bonus, and even Draven to some degree only capitalizes on his bonus gold through champion kills, which avoids the whole passive advantage aspect of bonus income but makes him more binary as a result. By contrast, Gangplank is now a pretty functional champion with the ability to do cool things in lane and scale well thereafter, so there really isn't an innate need for him to earn items faster than others, besides the flavor and pre-existence of his gold bonus. He does need an incentive to use his Q other than for poke, but Silver Serpents are already a good way to encourage that, and if nothing else he could be balanced around a weaker ult, as you mentioned, and stronger Silver Serpent-based upgrades, which would take away some of his free global power and allow him to be shut down more easily.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Bears eat people","date":"2016-08-24T13:21:51.145+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot should just revert GP rework.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ðelofasht","date":"2016-08-23T04:08:07.531+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about adding some risk to his gold gain by making the gold actually drop on the ground from his Q or Barrels, he actually has to walk out there and pick it up in order to collect it?

That started a chain reaction which we now see in pro and solo que games.  Honestly people tell me how much Gangplank was played in the Spring split? . Come on give it too me. After the triforce change everybody stopped playing Gp then the new build came and people started picking him up because HEY hes played in LCK he got to be OP now. Well truth to be told Gp isnt more broken than any other high tier top laner in the game. His ult does alot of dmg because of thunderlords if it wasnt for that keystone his dmg output wouldnt be that high early with his ult. Also most of the Pro Gps i see are honestly bad when comparing them to people who actually know how to combo with him with a few exeptions like Huni and Soaz back in the days though. The pros only use GP as a ult bot which is proven when they almost never hit the barrel comboes and still use the champion.  ( yeah someone walking into your barrel doesnt count as hitting a combo btw and if someone tells me that  a stationary target hit with a two barrel combo is pro work then meh no )  Gp getting almost perma banned in solo que is laughable and even when he is picked only a third or less of the players actually manage to become something else than ye old ult bot. TLD is actually a keystone that has made many champions very strong early and GPs ult is only one of many examples and yes i know who you want to think about {{champion:80}} . You might say that TLD is what makes champions suffer nerfs and not the champions themselves.  Why do i mention the pros you say because riot nerfs champions that mostly does well in Pro matches. I am only a silver player but i have watched alot of HIgh tier matches meaning Masters and Challengers matches and until the bad LCK Gangplank came up from the dephts almost nobody played GP unless they mained him. Nerf TLD or replace it before you start nerf every champ that synergize sometimes all to well with it thats the simplest thing to do or you might find your own champions being nerfed to the Kraken just because the early TLD dmg was too much. Btw i watched the semi between IMT and C9 sorry but the only impactfull Gp there was Hunis whos mechanism on the champion was good while the player called Impact was used as Ye old Ult bot and did not make an impact so to speak.","replies":[{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2016-08-23T02:25:55.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Champions often stop being played when they received nerfs simply because it takes time to get used to number changes behind the nerf. Not because they aren't strong. GP was still an unquestionably strong pick, but he's also has received some serious number changes in patches in which he gets attention being his barrel count and CD was adjusted among myriads of things. To bring a champion immediately that gets such a shift of power into professional play is downright illogical. \n\nRyze is another example of this. When he got his rework v2 (Not his current one), he was unquestionably the strongest top/mid laner in the game, yet you didn't see him for almost a full season. Why? Because it took professional players ages to hit the point where they had his number and combos down. The pros aren't going to play a champion whom they don't have the exact numbers down on.\n\nNot sure how you claim the pros are bad at GP when they are the ones that are the best at the game. Especially considering LCK is the undisputed hands down strongest region, player quality-wise, if a champion starts being picked and played with a build consistently in the LCK, that usually means its a strong champion. They're the ones that discover pretty much everything that everyone else plays. \n\nOften time, the meta we see in professional play is established or mimicked by the LCK. So if they start spamming a champion with a consistent build, that's usually a strong hint that said champion/build is powerful. Every pro will go to LCK/Korea before worlds for boot camp. Reason being, its the strongest region. \n\nIt's also incredibly ironic that you say Impact didn't have a contribution to the series against Immortals considering he was named the MVP of the BO5. And its also arguable that except for his one solid game on GP, Huni was the reason Immortals lost the series as he swallowed up so much of the teams resources and proceeded to tilt and play poorly with non-meta champions, deja vu to the Spring championship split.\n\nAlso, while yes, Huni did play well that one game, Reignover securing a triple inferno buff, basically an AD deathcap for Huni, certainly help him snowball his game. Not taking away from Huni's play, but his success with GP that game was in large part because Reignover pretty much handed him his damage on a silver platter. Impact would have done the same exact thing in his situation. Hell any professional top laner could have done what Huni did in his situation with a triple inferno. Hardly a strong case for good GP game play. \n\nEven when Impact was playing Gangplank he was playing him quite well, he was absorbing a lot of attention through repeated ganks and he made Immortals expend far too much in try to kill him. It was the rest of his team that didn't play well. \n\nAnd that's really whats key about Gangplank in professional play right now: he's so fucking difficult to kill that you need to expend a massive amount of resources into killing him. \n\nAnd the kicker is even if you kill him multiple times, because of his safe wave clear, bandit, and his gold generation passive, he's always guaranteed to hit his late game hyper-carry status. You know how the counter-play to late game hyper carries is to focus them down so much that they are crippled to a point where they will never hit that late game power spike? Yeah, absolutely not applicable with GP. See the problem? \n\nGP's problem is exactly what the OP is talking about: for such a late game hyper-carry champ, his ultimate has insane early-mid global pressure combined with the fact that he generates gold at a rate that's unparalleled to any other champion which leads inevitably to an insane late game that happens earlier then it should, is a recipe for an overly-strong champion. \n\nUntil they address that, he's going to go down the same road as Azir and Kalista.

Pros like Impact are used solely as an Ult Bot because they never or rarely hit the barrel comboes unless the target is standing still in the ult and yes i know how difficult it is to hit a combo. They will gut GP now until some guy finds out he can still be usable then Riot will gut him again just because someone maybe a pro most likely finds the only other way to play him. \n\nI have seen alot of LCK matches in Korea and yes i can say that i have seen Gps there i just want to cringe.  Koreans are the best at league no questions but in Pro matches i rarely see their Gps make impacts besides being used as an Ult bot. One of the first Pro match Gp after the triforce change was so bad that it hurt my eyes and yes this was the LCK. It got camped and seemed like it didnt understand that it got camped since it died or just ended up being an anchor to the rest of the team. And i see alot of LCK Gps doing the same thing over and over again unless their jungler babysits their lane. Straight after that One game there was a resurection of Gps in EU then in Na not sure about the rest dont watch brazil or australlian. There is also  a difference between how your able to play a champ in Pro matches vs solo que matches that i dont have to tell anyone. Which is why for a long time some pros tried to squeeze kha zix into the meta because they were almost dominating solo que with it. But yeah it failed. I honestly think some of the pros say Hey im great with Gp in que bet i can do as well in my Pro matches which ends having them using it once then twice because they thought the first was a fluke then a third and the chain reaction has comenced. \n\nHuni actually had plays with the gp which involved using the barrels which Pros rarely manage to do even if they manage to secure a inferno two or three. Basically its fun to watch a Gp player who knows how to use the comboes and doesnt have to wait for his ult to make an entrance.  Also i agree that the games they lost he felt like a spoonge that just sucked up resources that would be better for another player or he did something he really shouldnt. The Riven pick actually worked though until he went Kamikaze like a japanese pilot and smashed into the enemy team on repeat or when he had failed xpeke. Impacts barrel play was sitting up one barrel then wait for a champ to jump over the wall and walk right into the next barrel he sat out. If you think im hanging myself up on barrels well thats why thats part of GPs main Kit. \n \nThe ult of gp makes a so big impact with the TLD proc early that it destroys lanes without him being there and thats something that is rarely looked upon . It baffles me why TLD is never shown as a reason why many champions now dominate some pro matches but  more often solo que matches. They talk so much about the champions that they forget the keystones being used. If you know the difference between GP ulti without TLD then you should  know how much lower the dmg is specially early. The difference is literally a kill.\n\nAlso im saying Impacts Gp which just pressed R when needed isnt that impactfull in comparisson to acually setting up comboes and using his entire Kit. I did not mean that his other games wasnt good just the uneventfull Gp one. \n\nDo you think Ekko or GP got the highest winrate in pro matches ? I will go on a limb a say its Ekko who needs tweaks alot more than Gp does. Well atleast the Pros wont play him now thats hes being thrown to the Kraken. \n\nSo the Ult nerf im not very salty so to speak about but that they to change everything with him is overkill and just gutting. Gps early laningh phase is bad enough that you need to gut everything about it. Atleast he cant almost two shot you like Azirs soldiers could or actually almost still can in the early levels. They also start forcing Gp to go Top with everything they do now. and to end yes he can be played mid which is also were i have seen both China i think but def LCK try him which failed to be nothing more than a walking Cannon barrage button.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
