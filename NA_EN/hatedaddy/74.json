I am here to help you with something that's been plaguing our society recently: masterbaiters. As a fellow masterbaiter, I bring the insight of how to exploit the unfortunate fellow who happens to fall into a trap and take the bait in front of everyone, only to be laughed at and be very mad because of the Internet. Fear no more friends, I am going to teach you how to avoid being that guy with just a few simple steps! \n\nStep 1: Think.\n\nIs the message your reading realistic? Do you believe that anyone actually believes AP Fiora is OP freelo? This is probably a masterbaiter trying to lure you in! Don't take the bait! If the post they are making gives you the impression \"there's no way someone is actually this stupid,\" it's probably because they aren't! They are masterbaiting. Post anime, lol, random memes or a smiley face for maximum upvotes. Remember little tommy, think before you speak!\n\nStep 2. Confirming a masterbaiter.\n\nSadly in this world, no matter how simple it may seem to detect a bait thread, there will be subhumans who aren't capable of detecting it and take the bait. Don't post! When someone seemingly takes this bait, wait for the OP to respond to him directly. His message will likely be very sarcastic, seem even more unrealistic and could be a direct insult referring to the poor souls rank who took the bait. If by some small chance the OP is actually serious and thinks 6 gunblades Nunu is secret OP and tries to defend it, point and laugh furiously until your genitales fall off. \n\nStep 3: Play along with the masterbaiter to ensure maximum popularity that will lead to maximum internet bitches and make you an E-celeb.\n\nWhen you've confirmed a poster is indeed a masterbaiter, tag along in the fun. When he says 6 gunblades Nunu is secret OP freelo, point out that 5 gunblades Nunu with a runaans is even more OP freelo. You will get maximum upvotes and you can use these on your job applications, resumes and as rewards points at various gas stations for free hotdogs. After you've acquired enough of these upvotes, Internet groupies will love you and send you pictures of kittens and anime style hearts: embrace the bitches. You are a king. A man amongst boys. Embrace it little Roger.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nQ&A section:\n\nQ: \"but HateDaddy, AP Fiora is OP. You build Grail, death cap, lichbane and tank and one-shot squishies! I know it's true, it worked in a ranked game. But then EzSkillShot called me a bronzetard. Why was he so mean, does he not realize AP Fiora is OP?\"\n\nA: Sorry little Billy, EzSkillShot is correct. You are indeed a bronzetard. Though Jie is always hostile because he lost his power rangers Walky Talky, he is usually correct. Treat this as an opportunity to improve!\n\nQ: \"HateDaddy, I have spent time trying to improve as a masterbaiter but I'm just not there yet. How do I convince people that master Yi with 6 zeals one shot me? They just say I'm lame and this has been done before. Please help Daddy-senpai.\"\n\nA: Well little Jerry, it's simple. It has been done before! You must reinvent the wheel sometimes to get people's brains turning. Instead of saying 6 Zeals Yi one shot you, say 6 Zeals Yi one shot you, stole your bike and ravaged your village. People will laugh. Then the bait-takers will come in and hilarity will ensue.\n\nQ: \"but HateDaddy, MAGES are underpowered and need buffs, wtf?\"\n\nA: go play in traffic.\n\nQ \"HateDaddy, this isn't a question. It's a statement. Thank you for taking the time to help me learn how to not become a bait-taker. You rock!\"\n\nA: thanks little Arnold. I'll be sure to keep doing my best to inform the masses.\n\n---------------------\n\nA list of a few important words regarding this topic and their definitions:\n\nMasterbaiters: a poster who will make posts seeking simple minded folk who will respond angrily to his thread. This is generally a very smart, beautiful and sexy person whom you should always respect.\n\nBait-taker: the simple minded fool who will sadly display a severe lack of intelligence by responding to bait threads with lots of rage. Typically they will have very poor grammar, have selective reading and generally be illiterate. They are also most likely redditors.\n\n---------------------------\n\nThis concludes this guide. If you have any follow up questions, please feel free to ask. And if you simply want to show admiration and appreciation for my efforts, I do not turn down free RP. Thanks for your time General Discussion, keep it real.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nFirst Section: http://vocaroo.com/i/s0xUvOOybV3I\n\nQ&A Section: http://vocaroo.com/i/s1sYN6JeqqyE\n\nShout out to Kuronii Lumiira for making these, freaking awesome. \n\n\n","replies":[]}
