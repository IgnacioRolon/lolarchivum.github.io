At the beginning of the season, people were up in arms about lack of diversity in the jungle. I agreed at the time, the diversity of the jungle was scarce at best. It was basically Lee, Vi and whoever emerged from the ghost of nerfed past. \r\n\r\nSo what happens? Riot buffs tanks. Riot buffs items for tank junglers. It proves that these two direct buffs to tank junglers is a bit much, nerfs ensue. Fair enough, nerfs needed. Then people begin to QQ that original devourer sucks and its not worth buying or farming for being &quot;the late game&quot; jungle item. People want farm junglers to be good, so riot buffs the holy hell out of devourer. A few champions had an extremely abusive interaction with the item (Kayle). Riot nerfs Kayle because she was by far the dumbest with the item. Not good enough, people QQ about devourer, nerfs ensue - probably not needed but whatever. And now I&#039;m hearing QQ about warrior enchantment sucking lol. Yeah, the item you people spent the first three months of this season bitching about and riot nerfed it by 5 AD, prompting the legendary video known as &quot;5 AD.&quot;\r\n\r\nDo you not see the pattern? You guys complain about everything when it&#039;s good, EVEN WHEN ITS WHAT YOU WANTED TO BE GOOD. Some cases were extremely abusive, the height of the tank meta was a good example of what can go wrong when you buff the shit out of a single class and their items at the same time. Some nerfs might have been a bit much in hindsight. But then again, everything else has been nerfed around it that eventually it&#039;ll just come full circle again next season when one particular class is dominating.\r\n\r\nHonestly, this board just needs to be removed. Half of the posts that make it to the top aren&#039;t even constructive, it&#039;s just hiveminded low elo QQ that isn&#039;t even true or correct in regards to the complaints they make. Like, a massive amount of people still think yasuos ult grants him 50% armor pen and don&#039;t realize it&#039;s bonus armor, not total. But you can&#039;t bring up facts. You cant actually be rational here and use logic because it doesn&#039;t cater to the hivemind. And what&#039;s worse is, no matter how hard you try to reason and explain your stance, Mr. bronze V 16 LP with 922 games on B5 is just going to downvote you and in combination with his other hiveminded buddies, your post never happened. There needs to be serious reform on this board because quite frankly, the feedback here sucks. It&#039;s QQ over the same 3 champions no matter what the circumstances are, even though two those targets are complete garbage - one of which got unnecessarily nerfed because people on this board are majority bronze/silver and absolutely suck at this game and will bitch about a champion instead of try to understand their own gameplay. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s just hilarious to see all these things go full circle and it&#039;s as if people don&#039;t realize they&#039;re responsible for the mess they claim to hate in the first place. Nothing is more funny to see people wanting buffs for champions/items they wanted nerfed into the ground so hard just 6 months ago. \r\n\r\nRiot does take feedback here seriously. For all the QQ of Zed even when he wasn&#039;t that good, he got nerfed. All the QQ about veigars rework gutting him and riot not caring? Yeah you&#039;re idiots, they kept buffing him like every other patch and guess what? He&#039;s OP as fuck at the moment. Devourer needing nerfed when it&#039;s literally not viable in competitive and gives farm junglers a late game that makes them a little stronger even though it never gave them the capacity to do something they weren&#039;t already good at. Can&#039;t wait for the thread in 6 months to be &quot;you guys went too far with devourer nerfs&quot; -300 upvotes.\r\n\r\nThis board just gives me aids man. I want to try to be reasonable but then Im reminded that you can&#039;t reason with unreasonable people. Riot, just nuke this place. Make it so downvotes don&#039;t ruin a thread so that hivemind can&#039;t reign supreme. Old ran just fine without a system of downvotes sending posts into the abyss, you can keep this section and do the same so we aren&#039;t reddit 2.0.\r\n\r\nBring on the downvotes","replies":[{"poster":"Sherogarth","date":"2015-09-28T16:16:53.201+0000","up_votes":61,"down_votes":3,"body":"That how it works.\n\nTank meta -> assassins and adcs mains QQ,\nAssassin meta -> mages and adcs mains QQ,\nFighter meta -> assassins, tanks and adcs mains QQ,\nUtility Mages meta ->  fighters and adcs mains QQ\nand so on... :D\n\nYou cant make everyone happy... and you will never make adc mains happy xD.","replies":[{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-09-28T18:45:00.005+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":2,"body":"ADC mains agree.\n\nTo be fair the role basically encourages ADCs to kind of hate everything.

So yeah, I'd say anyone as amazing as him with a well built team would do extraordinarily well.\n\n\nGosu doesn't play with high elo players lol he hasn't played on his main account in over a month, he only plays on it once in a while to prevent decay and even then feeds in some high elo games (4/12 vayne at lvl 17 on one of his master accounts). These days 90% of his streams are him creating his nth smurf account titled \"level 9 to diamond in 24hrs\" because there are 30,000 people who watch and even pay him to stomp the shit out of players 50000 MMR below him and encourage him to ruin ranked for others. These viewers are also the first to call silver players trash in twitch chat because they let a challenger smurf tristana pentakill them when she was already 12/0 before the fight, and if some gold player manages to pull off a godlike play and kill gosu 1v1 then they call him a tryhard scripter playing an OP champ etc. You don't go 30/2 in ranked up until your diamond promos because you keep getting teams that protect the ADC, you go 30W/2L because you have an unfair advantage, so don't give me the excuse that he gets teams that protect him every single game, you know it's not true. \n\nOnly ADC main I truly respect is qtpie, he actually streams on his challenger account instead of nonstop smurfing to artificially boost his ego and self-confidence.  He's also genuinely funny and interacts with his viewers, meanwhile gosu accepts money yet ignores them as if they should be considered blessed that godsu himself allowed mere mortals to observe him murdering players that never stood a chance against him. Qtpie also frequently plays immobile ADC champs like Ashe/Draven (which gosu won't touch with a 9 foot stick) because   he's a better ADC player overall. I admit that gosu's mechanics are phenomenal, but he never wards, frequently picks fights that even in low elo would result in instant death for him if he wasn't already fed out of his mind, and overall is just too bloodthirsty and therefore need to use dashes as a crutch because he frequently walks into 3v1/gets hit by cc/lets enemies get in melee range etc.\n\nIn the end, having all your team fight, late game, DPS, objective control, and siege loaded on a single class just isn't fun. Maybe gosu isn't playing on his real account because the current state of the ADC role is troubling since the juggernauts make life hell for ADC's not named Vayne, but frankly I'm enjoying the opportunity to carry from any lane.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Squarefighter","date":"2015-09-29T00:58:04.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to main Kog in season 4, and I didn't hate EVERY class.

I think they have gotten a bit closer, but it still seems like if champion x is available, you pick them no matter what.","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-09-29T08:59:01.699+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"there used to be a poke comp back in late S4/early S5 like {{champion:25}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:412}}.

Devourer in particular is amusing because of how requested the change was and how much the community 180'd, though to be fair with the item, \"balanced among the pros\" and \"balanced in solo queue are always going to be two very different metrics.  Similar deal with Warrior.  Veigar I think is actually a hilarious overreaction, as he's either sleeper OP right now or back up with his fellow high-winrate low-playrate mages such as Heimerdinger.  Given the amount of QQ and the fact that his play rate remains low, I'm inclined to believe the latter.\n\nHowever, then it felt like you put on your tin foil hat, got up on your cardboard box podium, and started preaching.  These boards may not be the best, but were you ever a part of the old Champion Feedback forums?  They weren't a whole lot better than this.  Upvotes and downvotes still mattered, with enough downvotes locking a thread completely, then sending it down into the abyss.  Mods didn't exist there, meaning the community had to police its own, with mixed results.  Reds NEVER visited, meaning EVERY idea that came to those forums that didn't immediately attempt to leap over to GD was doomed to a slow death by suffocation.  The new boards have their problems, but so did the old ones.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jasiwel","date":"2015-09-28T19:31:11.077+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your post is too general and acts like The Boards is synonymous with the old GD. No. The Boards in itself has a lot more people on it than GD did and as many others have pointed, the people who complain are not the same individuals every time. The only people I see that are repeat complainers are the few Morde mains creating super threads (respectively) and Falcon (but it's always easy to understand why Falcon does what he does) - and that's only lately. \n\nYou need to understand that not everyone will be happy with the game because of how diverse the game is and how catering to everyone is probably the most difficult problem in commercial history. There is always someone who will find fault with one's content, with one's presentation and with one's methods of creation. Given more than 1,000,000 players are on League daily, that should give you some scope as to how many are on the Boards at any given time.     \n\nRiot has done a good job. Yes, they are not perfect. Yes, they recognize this fact. Is our community atrocious? Many times daily, yes, but that's also because we're more likely to share bad experiences than good ones given it is cathartic to know others feel the same. Does our community need to improve? Yes, a lot, but to say the entire community and entire boards is garbage is like saying humanity as a whole is garbage with no exceptions. Many people aren't vocal because they're content. Many people are vocal because they are discontent. But to state that the Boards or /r/leagueoflegends need to be removed is exceptionally ignorant.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reformed Dunni","date":"2015-09-28T17:11:50.616+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh these boards make me sick too, and I'm glad for the juggernauts because now people are qq'ing about getting rekt by Riven","replies":[]},{"poster":"GuiltyGecko","date":"2015-09-29T04:33:09.740+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Different groups of players complain at different times.

It's different minorities speaking up at different times depending on what's relevant in the meta.","replies":[]}]}
