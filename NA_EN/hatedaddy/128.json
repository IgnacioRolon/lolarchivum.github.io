Very seldom will an AD bruiser build all AD bruiser items, let me lay out the bruiser items so we can have a visual demonstration of what I mean:\r\n\r\n{{item:3078}} (this isn’t necessarily a bruiser item but it is one many bruisers build)\r\n{{item:3053}} \r\n{{item:3748}}: probably the quintessential bruiser item\r\n{{item:3022}} \r\n{{item:3071}} \r\n{{item:3091}} let’s just throw this in there because it really has no other place\r\n{{item:3026}} it’s arguable whether or not this is a bruiser item, i would say not but it is an item bruisers tend to build\r\n{{item:3156}} \r\n{{item:3074}} we should consider this a bruiser item only because it’s appealing to melee champions only\r\n{{item:3025}} maybe more of a tank item but bruisers do build this\r\n\r\nWhat do these items have in common? They offer a combination of HP, resistances, and damage, to enhance survivability. In reality, no AD bruiser every truly builds 5 of these items. What they typically do is go two, maybe 3 of these items at most, and either go into a tanks item set to greatly enhance their durability; or they go into an AD assassin/ADC’s item set to greatly enhance their damage. The logic is that building 5 bruiser items won’t greatly enhance the stats you need most so you trickle into other stats that will give your greatest need depending on the game (do I need more damage or durability?). \r\n\r\nAP itemization already covers these bases because many AP items already mix in HP, resistances, and ability power in their items. And like AD bruisers, AP bruisers have the option of picking up Tank items to enhance their damage ({{item:3001}}) and durability in one. Many AP items like {{item:3027}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3151}} and a mixture of {{item:3157}} and {{item:3102}} do the same thing for AP bruisers that the AD bruiser items do for AD bruisers. Typically an AP bruiser will build 3 of these at the most (see {{champion:68}} and {{item:3116}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3157}}) and they’ll make the decision if they need to enhance damage by going items like {{item:3089}} and {{item:3135}} (but at the cost of survivability) or enhance durability and go into tank items (and sacrifice damage). The difference is that many of these AP bruisers will also have tank-like utility while also having innate defensive tools that also scale with HP/AP (shields, %damage reduction, heals, etc). The very nature of AP itemization covers the needs for the few AP bruisers that exist. The concept of AP bruiser is also both hard to define and balance because there is a fine line between an AP bruiser and a mage (again, see Rumble who could honestly be classified as both; see Ryze for a champion who could be both but obviously leans towards a mage). It’s the same as AD bruisers and AD assassins having a fine line separating them. \r\n\r\nThere is no need to make “AP itemization more diverse.” It already is and given the nature of AP enhancing a larger variety of stats  (enhancing durability, damage and utility while AD only enhances damage and in some cases durability), AP itemization doesn’t really need to be more diverse. It does it’s job and because the philosophical approach to bruisers is a moderate damage dealer/moderate damage absorber; there’s no need to develop items to do this for AP bruiser - AP itemization already does.","replies":[{"poster":"Step Sis Lux","date":"2018-11-05T16:27:14.494+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think people dont have any problem with having \"good\"build as brusier, but with that we have twice more AD items than AP and basically every ap champion has almost same build","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-11-05T16:58:07.450+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"I keep explaining this to people but get downvoted.

Not the bullshit they keep doing. Give back your high ap builds and have them differeentiate that build from a 40% cdr build, which would nessecitate having a lower value of AP. So 40% cdr will come with ~40% less ap but you get a 40% increased uptime on spells. \n\nCdr builds should synergize with late game DPS mages like swain, Cassio, ryze, karthus, anivia and so on. Whereas high raw damage/no cdr builds should synergize with champions who want to burst. Like lux, leblanc, Kat, and so on. 1shots should not be possible without being fed with a 40% cdr build and the choice you make should be high burst or high dps. \n\nThere should be other changes along with it but that would go a bit towards making ap itemization feel like you have more choices instead of cookie cutter builds on all champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lovelle","date":"2018-11-05T18:09:52.437+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3230}} is a fighter item now.

I feel like the nature of AP would lend it to being heavily abused my mages, so there would need to be checks on it that would discourage mages from building it if it existed. Also, magic resist values do not tend to get as high as armor values on champions, (champions typically build more armor than MR), so I’m not sure one is really needed. AP bruisers will have pretty decent utility too, so in reality we need to ask if AP bruisers should really have %MR shred available to them when they’re already incredibly disruptive.
