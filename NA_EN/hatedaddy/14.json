Please also be realistic with availability, if your schedule only has 2-3 hours of free time a day at awkward times, you probably shouldn't sign up. I will officially end sign ups by tomorrow night at 11:59pm est (12/10/14 11:59pm est).\n\n\nHave at it\n\nEDIT: 12/10/14\n\nK, another update here.\n\nRiot is looking at sometime between Monday and Friday of next week with the option of one SR game or 3 ARAM games. I'm going to take the ARAM games to get as many people as possible and this does help eliminate the need for positions or even team captains. So keep a lookout for draft results and since I have until next week (when the game swill begin), I'll probably do the draft Friday night and post results so people have the weekend to know if they're in and meet the schedules.\n\nTeam GD Members (winners of the draft! yay!)\n\n\n2.
