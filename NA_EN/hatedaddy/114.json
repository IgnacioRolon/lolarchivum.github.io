I also realize that regardless of whether I continue to play or not, Riot doesn't really care and they'll continue to make their money. I am replaceable and irrelevant, I am not trying to suggest I am anything other than that. However, as I have spent quite a bit of my time - which isn't easy to come by - and hard earned money on this game for 5 years, I feel that the least Riot can do is hear me out. \r\n\r\nI do not have fun playing league of legends anymore. In fact, this has been the most unfun season I've ever had and that's keeping in mind some of the ridiculous fuckery we've seen in various seasons like the cinderhulk/thornmail tank meta of s5, the ADC meta of s6, the constant top lane mage meta top lanes where the likes of Vlad, Ryze, Cass, Lulu and Lissandra invalidate melees entirely and force them out of the game. I realized that those metas wouldn't last forever and I wasn't obligated to play through them rigorously because they'd change and that's exactly what happened. \r\n\r\nMy complaints of the game have less to do with balance. I realize there's quite a bit of ADC hate at the moment but that's not new. Truthfully, I find that the balance outside of ADCs spiking a bit too early is fairly good minus a few classes - but that doesn't matter because even if balance wasn't good, it's always subject to change and you can quickly see annoying metas squashed with PBE updates and eventual patch changes. Long story short, riot is pretty transparent about their efforts and attempts to balance the game as well as be open about those changes. I respect that, I always have. It's one of the few things that's kept me around this long because frankly, I've been considering quitting for quite some time. But I have hope that's riot will adjust the current lackluster game.\r\n\r\nWhat I hate right now is very simple: games snowball too hard and end too quickly. Very rarely do I feel like I've had an opportunity to engage in riveting gameplay. If I play fighters, i split push and either my team understands how to play this way or they don't. If I play tanks, I rely on my team to follow up on plays, play around my zone control and not waste my deaths. I have very little ability to carry games because of how quickly gold stacks up for teams. This isn't exclusive to any class, no class allows someone to solo carry and I suppose that's fine but the fact that the games end so quickly now without me contributing much frustrates the hell out of me. \r\n\r\nI don't get to expand upon my potential win conditions, those are decided in the first ten minutes. Regardless of how well I perform unless I just flat out feed my ass off, I'm going to do the same thing and I'll do it with the understanding that I won't really have a true moment to feel like \"I'm playing the game\" because it feels more like simply going through the motions. Lane phase ends so quickly, one teamfight 25 minutes in likely ends the game. Dragons and Rift Harold are laughable easy to kill. Baron and Elder are laughably easy to kill. Towers do no damage and die to paper balls. The interaction between damage and durability go hand-in-hand to ungodly levels of snowball. When you're ahead, you melt everything and die to nothing and wen you're behind, you do no damage and die to paper cuts. I feel like the skill required to function in this game has been removed. \r\n\r\nAs a long time DooM 2 player from the early 2000s, I'll make a doom reference: I feel like the game went from skill level of Nightmare! to I'm too young to die. I feel like instead of sweeping through the map carefully and dealing with respawning monsters, strong monsters galore like Revs, Archvilles and Mancubi, I'm constantly killing pistol zombies and simply pressing exit. There is no gameplay, it's  been so watered down by its extreme pace that many of the finer nuances of the game feel lost. Coming back feels impossible, teamfights end too quickly, CC is out of control, as is damage. Creep block makes playing melees miserable and all of this is occurring with the foresight of understanding that the biggest and most fundamental change to ever occur will take place next season with rune/mastery changes.\r\n\r\nMy response? No thanks, enough is enough. My time has always been limited but if I truly enjoy something like I did with League for so long, I will make time for it even if it means I lose out on significant amounts of sleep. I value my hobbies and my family understands this and encourages me to do it. But I don't value the current game and the fact that there's no self examination or evaluation openly taking place about the current game pace and he laughably easy amount of effort it takes to kill everything and snowball with games commonly ending by 25 minutes and instead a discussion about adding more broken runes/masteries to the game rather than addressing the former and adding another element of gameplay that further fucks balance and gameplay, I've had enough. This is where I get off. The game isn't enjoyable. \r\n\r\nAnd it's going in a direction that isn't addressing what I find to be massive issues currently when Riot is a billion dollar organization with virtual limitless resources in the gaming world - in other words, there's no excuse for some of the things being as bad as they are as you either allowed it to happen before it got to a point of no return or you simply aren't making the effort required to fix it now.  \r\n\r\nI am finishing out the season because in my youth, I had a horrible tendency to procrastinate and leave things unfinished. In recent years, I've gone away from that and I finish everything I start. I intend to do that with this season but I do it with the knowledge that while I may quit, I'm not going to do so without at least getting these frustrations off my chest. But this isn't my only complaint, I have one more.\r\n\r\n I hate the current rank system that rewards players for playing thousands of games, making it virtually impossible to really demote. This cut off is right at my elo, right around diamond 5 (where I belong) and it makes my elo/rank bracket the most toxic and unfun experience because these terrible players can play 3000 games a season, climb this high with a 47-48% winrate and lose 20-30 games in d5 before even being demoted and all they need to do is win 5 games to get right back. You should honestly be demoted an entire league when you demote from a tier - I.E if you demote from diamond 5 to play, you should fucking demote to plat 5 where your terrible ass belongs because nobody should lose twenty games in a row in an elo where they belong, EVER. \r\n\r\nOnce again, I realize I'm unimportant in the long run. I understand I'm a spoke on a wheel that will keep turning regardless of whether I remain or not. But I love this game, at least I loved it and it sucks so bad that I simply don't find it enjoyable anymore. I'd rather speak about how I feel and say my piece than silently fade off unsatisified. \r\n\r\n*Tl;dr there are so many problems with this game right now from game pace issues to creep block that need to be addressed first instead of going to an even more complicated rune/masteries system that will likely take all of next season to balance, further putting off issues that need to be addressed now. And your ranking system fucking sucks.*","replies":[{"poster":"Riot MapleNectar","date":"2017-08-29T17:05:23.143+0000","up_votes":162,"down_votes":15,"body":"Hey HateDaddy,\n\nTo start off, I just wanted to say that we, Riot, do care when people choose to stop playing League. We might not be able to address everyone individually, but as gamers ourselves and players who love to play League, whenever someone, let alone a super engaged player chooses to leave, it gives us reason to take a step back and think about what we're doing, or not doing, that made you want to make that choice. I can empathize with a lot of what you wrote here, as I've been playing League since 2009, and joined Riot back in 2014 (god that seems like forever ago), and want to try to touch on at least some of what you've said.\n\nI want to make it clear the statement that you're replaceable and irrelevant isn't true. Full stop. We can't simply \"replace\" a player who has been a long time supporter of League, we can't replace those experiences, the highs, the lows, and everything in between that you experienced. To me that's one of the reasons I love League, because when I think back on the 8 1/2 years of playing, my own experience is my own personal story where I can remember times in the past before a meta, when Ashe mid tping to a ward after ulting from fountain was a thing. I can remember when Rock Solid made GP support a thing in the pro scene and it worked. I remember when Veigar evaporated people with DFG and when Yi could EASILY 1v5. I remember when TF had his destiny on his E, and would tp to a side lane bush and have his team follow him for a cheesy early game kill. Those are the memories and experiences that if I left couldn't be replaced. It's all a part of the journey, and the never ending path to mastery that keeps me coming back to League year after year. Have there been times I've wanted to quit? God damn right there has been. Hell, I have a baby now, and another on the way in February, and with my free time quickly fleeting, the first thing I still want to do when I get an hour to myself is load up a game of League and get my ass handed to me on the Rift (that or play a quick game of pubg if I don't have enough time). But enough about me, let's talk about what you wrote here, again I won't be able to touch on everything, but I'll try my best with the time I have.\n\nThe feeling that this season has been one of the least fun seasons for you is a very interesting thing to callout, as despite what I've said about, it's something that I've felt **at times** but not the entire season as a whole. Usually when I feel like the game has lost all appeal, is after I've had a run of games where someone went full potato on me team, or raged out at us for several games in a row. Those are the times that I stop and ask if it's really worth it, but then when I find an hour of freetime...I still keep coming back. So there seems to be difference with what we classify as what makes League fun. For me, if my teammates are level headed rational people, League is still the best game ever, but for you it seems like it's more about the state of the game which takes the fun away, so let's dive into that a bit.\n\nSnowballing and game length are some very interesting things to point out as reasons for feeling the game isn't fun. Anecdotally, I feel like my games have had more variance in terms of quality of game play for the past year, and to me personally, it's led to a feeling of games feeling more snowbally at times. On the other hand though, I also feel like I've been in games with more epic \"come from behind\" victories due to good teamplay, catchup xp/gold which helps cushion snowballing, and over confident opponents. League was designed as a team game, and when people snowball the hell out of their lanes winning 1v1, 2v2, or with some help from the jungler, the game also gets determined by which team has the better comp. The infamous \"don't worry we'll scale\", is actually a thing that matters, and has led me to experience more games that maybe felt like they were decided at 10 minutes, but actually swung in my favor as we scaled. In regards to playing fighters specifically, we have a task on our plate to figure out how to best support melee champs in League holistically that we're aiming to get to early next year. Right now being relegated to split pushing, and buying the same items that your fellow marksman are purchasing usually makes one of the most valuable stats in the game (range) make you come second to anyone else that can build the same items. This often forces melee fighters to rely on splitpushing, which is a pretty shitty solution to a problem when you want to be in the middle of a team wrecking havoc whether it be with your blade or your fishing rod. Sorry that was a bit tangential, but you called out fighters and I wanted to touch on it a bit.\n\nPlease correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like a lot of what's leading you to feel fed up with League is how heavily you need to rely on teammates to do the right thing? If that's the case, it's going to be a bit trickier to solve the problem for you explicitly, as the design of LoL is based so heavily on coordination with teammates, whereas a game like DOTA is designed around each champion being capable of carrying their team more easily. I won't go super heavy into this discussion, since I'm not a designer and didn't create the original dota, dota 2, or League (I just work on the balance team), but we have intentionally gone the direction of having all the micro decisions you make in champ select, runes/masteries, in itemization, in lane phase, and macro level calls all feed into increasing your chance to win. I definitely don't think we've perfected it, and we have a long way to go until we can say that's 100% the case, but I'd be curious what sort of solutions you'd like to see to make League the game that you want to keep playing? Is it the ability to better coordinate with teammates? Is it the ability to more consistently carry a game when you rock the lane phase and go 6/0? Is it giving a different distribution of damage and durability to champs? Or retuning jungle mobs and epic encounters? I'm asking this to be pedantic, I'm genuinely curious in your thoughts as a diamond player and person who's played League for as long as you have.\n\nI never played Doom, so unfortunately I can't touch on your references, what I can say however is we've been talking internally about how we can make epic monsters (Rift Herald, Baron, Dragons), actually feel...epic. There won't be anything in for this pre-season as we're trying to keep the runeway (hue) for runes reforged as clean as possible for as stable a launch as we can get, but we're talking about them for next year. No concrete plans as of yet, but it's one thing I wanted to call out since you pointed out how they currently feel. In regards to teamfights I think this one becomes a bit more nuanced and subjective, as my perception of the live state currently is that coming back is arguably more possible now, that teamfights are actually longer, but I think I can concede the point about CC being higher especially in a time like right now when tanks are strong and viable. Creep block is another thing we've been talking about, not removing it, but making some adjustments so we can avoid as many of the \"I was literally stuck in my creeps\" situations as possible. \n\nI would go into the runes reforged stuff, but I'd prefer to leave that to the team (who's been pumping out a ton of content/articles on their progress), and I have to say that while I was personally skeptical of the system at first (like waaaay back), more and more recently I've been getting excited theory crafting how a particular keystone would synergize with a champion or playstyle I enjoy. When I'm testing internally it _feels_ more like early seasons, when theory crafting was another key way you could find your way to victory, and I'm super excited for the new system to go live, and see what problems it solves, and what we need to continue to work on (like some of the ones I touched on above).\n\nIn regards to the rank system, this is one which I may actually be the most aligned with you, and it's been the topic of some hot debate last Friday in the office in one of our slack channels. There are some major pros to the way it works now, in regards to things like how you can feel a sense of progression as you play, but there's definitely some pitfalls when you run into people who seemingly just grinded their way to their mmr and don't actually have the skill to hold their own. I do honestly believe that we have one of the best matchmakers and ranked systems around, but definitely don't think it's perfect either, though sadly I don't have much context into that space I could give you. Just know that it's a thing we talk about a lot ourselves.\n\nTo close this off. I want to first say that if you do choose to truly leave League, I hope you find another avenue that brings you the same highs that I've experienced in the past 8 1/2 years, whether that be in games, or in the real world (fuck it's scary out there). You're not just a spoke in a wheel, as for every person like you that writes a clearly passionate and informed post that you did, there's 10 others who leave silently. Yes, we can replace you with another player if we looked at our players as just 1s and 0s, but that's not how we look at you. You've been a part of this journey and have supported us, and it's on us to prove that League is a game you should feel confident in spending your time and getting rewarded for doing so. Whether that's ranked dominance, super fucking high moments, or riveting gameplay. I appreciate the time you took to write this, and I'm sorry if it felt like I was glossing over any of your statements. I'm not the best equipped to answer all of them. If you do have followup though please reply to this and I'll try to get back to you at some point over the next few days. \n\nI'm really sorry that this is likely riddled with typos and shitty grammar, it's early and I haven't had my coffee yet :P, also note that a lot of this is just my opinion, and not an official stance from Riot, but I wanted to reach out to you regardless. \n\nThanks again man, and good luck over the rest of the season!\nAsyrite","replies":[{"poster":"HateDaddy","date":"2017-08-29T22:48:19.388+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey asyrite...\n\nThanks a lot for your response as well as the time and effort you put into it. I'm not bothered by grammatical flaws, I'm a psychology major, not a literature major :p. I typically don't have the time to respond as quickly as I'd like so I do apologize that it took me so long to clarify a few things. \n\nHonestly, my frustrations aren't really tied to being unable to \"carry games solo.\" This element has always been present in league, though admittedly in previous seasons it certainly felt the potential to solo carry games was much higher. That's neither here nor there as that's a rather amibiuous element of game play to accurately measure. It does feel like that's true to an extent but no, I wouldn't say it's a \"gripe.\" It's simply part of the game.\n\nI imagine much of my frustration comes from fighters and top lane in general. This isn't the first time bot lane decides the game, in reality that's been true for 80% of leagues existence. But it's the manor in which it happens - between ganks, dives and a plethora of tools available in this game to secure kills with relative ease, it feels like bot - and in many cases mid - become such disatoruous or advantageous stomps that I likely have very little to contribute to the game except split push. That's frustrating as hell. I also can't interact with my lane opponent because any sign of aggression is likely the result of an incoming gank so top lane becomes this remote island where interaction is scarce because junglers have way too much control over the lane (and the game quite frankly but that's another toooc entirely).\n\nI'm fed up, im tired and I'm burnt out. I've always sworn to myself if I'm not having fun anymore, im not going to stick around for long. I will finish the season because it would bother me on a personal level of it didn't - I don't care if anyone thinks that's lame honestly. And the things that make this so unfun with melees sucking, creep block, game pace, glass objectives and general snowballing, they are things that have been true really all season and even parts of last season. I've lost faith that Riot wants to fix this because in my estimation, given Riots obsession with competitive play, im not sure that the top brass even see it as an issue because their pockets are getting lined regardless. And let's not pretend money isn't a big deal here, I don't even blame them. I used to deny that Riot lost its \"ties\" the community but in reality, it has and it has for a long time. With all of this things culminating, I've reached the conclusion that this game is no longer worth my time. Anr I don't see anything changing my mind on that.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot MapleNectar","date":"2017-08-30T15:50:34.409+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey HateDaddy!\n\nOk phew, I was econ and comp sci, so writing isn't always my strong suit :P English is also my second language, but I got out most of those kinks when I was younger.\n\nThanks for clarifying on the carrying games solo part. It was primarily what I'd gleened from your initial post, but I think your third paragraph is where the frustration truly comes from. It's interesting how bot lane's impact on the game is viewed as a problem (not necessarily incorrectly) when we've also had the memes of the tp clown fiesta bot lane, adc2017 memes, and other periods of time where bot lane folks felt like no matter what they did they had no ability to have a meaningful impact on the game, because other roles had too much agency to get to bot and shut them down early. A large part of the current perception though, and I'm not talking about the marksman stuff we're seeing on live right now, is due in part to how they scale, and the value that ranged has in a game. A marksman like Trist, Sivir, Kog as just a few examples have very specific strengths that make it so that the later they get in game, the more impact they get to have. Whether that's being able to chip away at the enemies in teamfights thanks to range, taking down objectives like turrets or Baron, or quickly clearly side lanes and building lane pressure. The path to get there though is typically reliant on a much more punishing early/mid game, periods where they're waiting to hit critical item spikes to let them chew through whatever is in front of them. Basically in games that go beyond 30 minutes, I believe it's more likely that a loss will be attributed to the marksman that gets the triple kill and then helps push down mid and kill the nexus rather than the jungle or top laner that cced an enemy, or  the midlaner that got the pick. It's viscerally easier to remember the person who got the kills as opposed to everything else happening around them. That's not to say that marksman AREN'T actually what's causing a team to win, but that's usually because they got to the point in the game where that's what they should be doing. Right now things like Ardent Censer mitigate some of that mid game lull as an item that let's them spike (we have more work planned that we're going to look to ship after Worlds), and we think that will help somewhat, but there's more underlying problems that also need some good design work done. \n\nThe particular line \" it feels like bot - and in many cases mid - become such disastrous or advantageous stomps that I likely have very little to contribute to the game except split push\" was actually a primary driver for the recent Draven change. For now we didn't want to lower numbers on his kit, as there's a fair bit of counterplay around him, but rather the reduce the powerless feeling of being top, mid, or jungle, and watching the Draven cashing in on his passive time and time again in bot lane leaving you little recourse to stop him. With being able to punish him early , it forces the Draven player to play smart to get through that early/mid game, and if he does he gets to do Draven things, but not just because he got first blood and got a huge gold spike over his lane opponent. This gives people playing against a Draven to deliberately do things to stop him from just \"winning more\". This is glossing over the topic of \"agency over bot lane\" quite a bit, but it's a thing that's definitely a cycle. If we were to reduce the channel time on TP again, I'm sure we'd see the sentiment swing again the other way, it's s balancing act and we need to figure out a better solution for it. \n\nIn regards to not being able to push up in top lane for fear of the jungle, do you have any ideas of how you'd like that resolved other than just \"make junglers weaker\". What if there was a world where supports didn't have to go bot with the marksman, and there was either a designated \"roamer\" on the team, or an item system that would allow supports to go top, or mid, or bot, and not just be tied to playing with an adc? What do you think would be a reasonable path forward?\n\nI'm interested in what makes you feel that our \"top brass\" calls the shots both in how we balance the game. People like Ghostcrawler certainly has an influence as he's the lead designer for all of League, but I've never once had him come to the balance team pit and say \"you guys need to buff x,y,z for pro play\", it's just not what happens here. In regards to community involvement, I think it's an area we may have backed away from in terms of active interaction, but we read the boards, we read reddit, we read twitter, and try to take as much player sentiment into account before we ship something. Malphite being a good example from last patch. We pulled him on the last possible day we could, because we learned about the prevalence of support Malphite in China, and how the playstyle is something that players there really care about. Rather than say \"too bad\", we opted to pull the changes in order to make sure we were confident we weren't killing the playstyle players cared about. We do things like that quite frequently, sadly though it's not always apparent. We're (the balance team) is currently building a strategy for how we can communicate with the playerbase not just in NA and EU, but in all our regions, but it's taking some time. We're only 10 guys, and the communication bridge to gap there is massive.\n\nTo end this off. If you feel like you need to leave League at the end of the season I strongly encourage you to do so, but maybe check back in 6 months or a year, maybe you'll find the game has changed for the better and want to come back. Or maybe you'll have found something else that gets you excited to power on your computer whenever you come home, that's a totally fine alternative too. Gaming is all about tastes and preferences, and if we we're not offering what you want right now, maybe we will again in the future. Thank you for your thoughtful post man, it definitely had me thinking on my walk home last night. God speed!\n\nAsyrite","replies":[{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2017-08-30T16:51:29.590+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"The simple solution to fear of the jungle for laners is to make wards purchasable again, but we know you won't do that because it would push the vision load onto supports again. However, the fact of the matter is that the reason people won't push in lane is because the map is too dark. That is a change Riot made intentionally, and it has influenced a lot of how laning phases go these days.\n\nAnother way you could make laners feel more free without making junglers weaker is to just take away their random true damage nuke with a % movement speed steal. Seriously, this is completely ridiculous. You have champions that are designed to function as junglers. They have {{champion:64}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:35}} mobility specifically designed to allow them to get in and get kills with their allies. This is installed in their kits. The addition of {{item:3706}} was completely unnecessary. Either junglers are balanced in their kits, or they are not. They do not need a low cooldown 5th ability that gives them a point and click slow and speed boost. That is a large amount of power. An extreme amount of power. It is up far more often than similar summoner spells like {{summoner:14}} or{{summoner:3}} and there's really just no reason for it! If you think champions like Lee Sin or Rek'Sai are unable to kill enemies often enough with their kits, then they need more damage or higher ratios in their kits. The abilities that have their own cooldowns, and counterplay. They do not need part of their power budget installed in an ability that is point and click and gives them an additional speed boost on top of them already having decent speed as melee champions. \n\nHonestly, if you can justify why ganking junglers deserve what is essentially a fifth ability (not a summoner spell), then I'm all ears. Otherwise this seems like a lot of excess power on otherwise completely balanced kits.\n\nAs for why it feels like the top brass are calling the shots, the best example I can give you is that of {{champion:91}} .\n\nI can't find a link but there was a discussion after Kassadin's rework and LeBlanc's Q was changed to Sigil of Malice from Sigil of Silence. People asked why Kassadin and LeBlanc would lose their targeted Silence while Talon's Cutthroat remains the same. Riot replied with \"we think Talon's silence is a problem as well but we don't want to remove it because people would ask questions like 'why are you nerfing Talon, he's not even a problem right now'.\"\n\nA more recent example is the change to Fiddlesticks, http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-76-notes.\n\nThe balance team understood that Fiddlesticks had issues with his combo. Players were making mistakes, they were not using Drain and Terrify together correctly with the range change, and the patch notes even admit the new version might be more frustrating than the version the change was made to fix. And yet it took nearly a year for Riot to revert this change. They only paired this usability buff with another buff while Fiddlesticks was a problem. \n\nIt seems like Riot prioritizes champions that are widely considered to be \"too weak\" or \"too strong\" in their balance changes, this constant flow of whack-a-mole, and it feels like important changes that actually affect how mains enjoy or play their champions are left in the dust until those champions are deemed too weak or too strong.\n\nThen there's bugs and how they affect balance. God this is annoying. \n\nThe most blatant example of this is Sona's Power Chord - Diminuendo. http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/patch-38-notes-0\n\nSona's passive NEVER WORKED before Patch 3.8. It seemed to reduce the numbers that were displayed but not the actual damage dealt. It took Riot years to even notice this bug and when they finally fix it? They immediately nerf it. Sona players never got to experience the actual Power Chord - Diminuendo as it was written because it was bugged for so long and then immediately nerfed as a compensation for actually fixing it. So all the times that I used Power Chord - Diminuendo before patch 3.8 thinking that I was reducing people's damage for 4 seconds, I was actually reducing their damage for 0 seconds. And then when Riot decides to tell me \"hey we fucked up, but here, we fixed it. Also it's nerfed.\" How am I supposed to take that, as a Sona player?\n\nAnother great example is Garen's Villain passive. Garen was heavily nerfed like three times after the juggernaut update because he was dealing too much damage. Then Riot fixes a bug where his Villain passive was having him deal % true damage to his targets based on HIS maximum health instead of THEIRS. Obviously this is a huge difference in true damage that Garen was dealing, but did it come with any reverts to his previous nerfs? No. He was left weak because he was being balanced around a state where his bug was out of control, then the bug was fixed and he was left with the previous balance changes.\n\nIf you think that Riot has done any job of trying to demonstrate that the balance team is on the players' side, well, here are some examples I'm showing you of times where your talk has overshadowed your walk. \n\nThen there's champions like Maokai, Evelyn and Olaf. Champions that were just too dominant at the higher levels of play, so Riot comes in with a hammer and RUINS them. \n\nOlaf lost his passive armor penetration on his ultimate without any significant changes to his base damage or base stats. His W was so weak the base AS buff had to be DOUBLED for it to feel like an actual ability. \n\nMaokai lost his ultimate and gained...ugh. Maokai may be more balanced now but he's just not fun to play anymore. Not to mention, when he was first reworked his E was changed to have the % health damage front-loaded instead of scaling. Then later it was changed back to have the damage scale with rank again.\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-710-notes - Sapling Toss damage changed from 6/6.5/7/7.5/8% of a target's maximum health to 8% of the target's maximum health at all ranks.\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-716-notes - Sapling Toss damage changed from 8% of a target's maximum health at all ranks to 6/6.5/7/7.5/8% of a target's maximum health.\n\nSo...it really seems like Riot took a hammer to Maokai just to get him out of pro play with absolutely **no idea** what direction they were planning to take him in. Since then they've been floundering to try and make him have **some kind of identity.**\n\nI have raised concerns about this point on two separate occasions:\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/ws2o7EUk-what-exactly-is-the-goal-of-maokais-update\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/UYHP1khA-maokais-supposed-to-be-a-hearty-tank-who-wades-into-combat\n\nAnd neither discussion received any red attention.\n\nThen there's Evelyn. Just...Just Evelyn.\n\nSo yeah. As a long time player I really don't want to think that Riot is my enemy, but I have no illusions about them being my friend either. \n\nI have done my best here to vocalize nearly all of my opinions on the subject of Riot's balancing team (except for the subject I am most passionate about, which I have documented fully over here: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/G47qqkqF-what-the-actual-hell-meddler), so I hope that you read over this and try to understand, Asyrite.

There comes a time when it just isn't good to explain what's going on with patches so that players can \"discover\" for themselves why some adjustments were made in a certain direction. If you are in a position of power and you really think you understand the game better than the short-minded average league player, then prove it by making your point. Change the game and leave it that way for a while.\n\nYou guys keep tuning the game and iterating with small number adjustments and changes. Sure, it makes it competitive, but it doesn't make it fun. I can't learn to play a champion, for example, and expect that the champion will play the same way in two weeks because you guys keep changing it. Same with items. Reworking existing champions and/or items to make them more fair to play against or more mechanically intense and exciting does not work if simply for the fact that League is too simple of a game.\n\nAnd what I mean by simple is this - there are six keys for your champion. Item actives hardly \"count\" because they're not UNIQUE to your champion. And if I put it that way, then each champion really only has four keys because Summoner Spells are also not unique to your champion. These four keys are also usually not very interesting - they lack depth. There aren't many abilities for example, like Fiora's parry. Fiora's parry interacts (key word) with other abilities and there's a huge mindgame behind when, how, and where to use it (against opponents) and how to play against it (when versus Fiora). Same thing with Master Yi's Alpha Strike (albeit a lot less so because you can't really \"mess up\" with Alpha Strike) and Meditate - they interact with other champions and other champions' abilities.\n\nCompare this with the average League ability - say (Insert Skillshot Here). Sure, it's outplayable in the sense that you can play something like a Mini-Touhou with your mouse to \"dodge\" it. But it certainly doesn't feel that great to do so. Nor is it really interactive. It's not so much about timing as it is inputting random movements with your mouse to confuse your enemy and make it hard to predict where you're going. Let's put it this way - if a robot inputting random directional movement controls of variable movement durations (say x to x+3 number of \"steps\", based on RNG) can \"outplay\" these skillshots, then it's not really interesting or dynamic gameplay. It doesn't matter what the other player trying to land the skillshot does, the robot will do what it does and dodge the skillshot simply by chance. It becomes gameplay that's about as interesting as rolling dice repeatedly.\n\nSkillshots are only healthy for the game in moderation, regardless of what your players may SAY they want if only for the fact that they're all the same boring thing over and over. I remember when trying out new champions used to be interesting. Kayle, although an unfair champion in many cases is a great example. She has so much pressure simply because her ultimate is NOT FAIR. I can't say I enjoy playing against Kayle, but at the very least someone who's playing Kayle can enjoy playing her because she has that NOT FAIR card.\n\nI play Veigar, for example, because he's NOT FAIR in some situations. I love it when I press R and my opponents just outright die. I love it when I flash, QR and they just die. Lack of counterplay is subjective - \"counterplay\" doesn't have to be limited to mouse movements. In fact, I actually kind of liked when League wasn't all about these micro mouse movements.\n\nAnd finally, the dynamic between the champion classes is pure theory. It doesn't play out in that way in the actual game because of the way your items system works. I can't do your work for you, so I'll leave it to you to figure out what's wrong with it.\n\nSincerely,\nAnother Long Time League Player who Doesn't Play as Much Anymore","replies":[{"poster":"Elikain","date":"2017-08-30T14:08:08.829+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"And when a champion has been left to their own devices \"for a while\", we get the same kind of problematic nagging from players calling out \"shit tier\" \"or OP tier\" consistently.

After 2 or 3 losses my gains instantly go from +22 to +13 and -24, meaning just because of those 2 or 3 losses my hopes of climbing become slim to none. It's really hard to improve from d5 because if d5 is your rank you have to grind games to improve, but the variance that comes with grinding games at your \"true rank\" hurts so much for d5 players. Loss streaks destroy you and win streaks barely help. I honestly would rather minimize the \"tier safety net\" if it meant not destroying your mmr. The \"tier safety net\" is more of a bottom tier bear trap as once you land in this net it locks you up for good. Every time I get demoted I'm able to grind back to d5 but once I'm there I know if I can't continue my winstreak from p1 straight to d4 i'll be trapped in d5 again. I'd imagine this is similar across tiers, explaining why each tier is so populated in it's bottom rank. Maybe 0 lp losses at tiers could have some sort of demotion series where you play 2 games and have to win at least 1.

Pro play in my mind is something we should keep balancing watch over and I am find with it being considered when we do balance. My problem is the way Riot wants to balance Pro. Riot has actively worked to make the games quicker for pros and viewers and in turn make it seem more like Overwatch, or something. This in my mind has had negative effects on the casual experience and the pro player/viewer experience. No one likes short games because often those are stomps. Hell even in Overwatch or Paladins or whatever, no one cares for short 5 minute stomps. This is in turn faulty logic and hurts the best aspect of League. The long brawls of back and forth fighting. \n\nFor me, my favourite moments have always been the games that feel like they could go either way at any moment but always are somewhat close. Games that sometimes lead to rushing back doors, making explosive plays at 40 minutes to get a massive lead, etc. Games that start and end within 25 minutes are the worst games because they did not show anything interesting. They weren't fun and competitive matches.\n\nSo these two elements all come together to create the Season 7 experience. A snowball, one-sided stomp fest that saps the fun out of the game for a lot of people. That is my issue with league on the grand scale. I really hope season 8 slows the game back down so we can have games that aren't like that.","replies":[{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2017-08-29T20:19:40.490+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This.
