But why does every freakin AP item not named void staff, rabadons and DFG offer durability on champions who don't even get in the middle of teams aside from AP bruisers?\r\n\r\nI could go on asking for AP itemization nerfs but instead, why is there basically no good fighter/bruiser item that offers this? Trinity, bork and hydra are basically the only bruiser items at this point. Frozen mallet is laughable, wits end is should be renamed warwicks end, atams is lol. Theres no offensive variety for a class of champions designed to be in the middle of an enemy team, only defensive items and even then its slim pickings. \r\n\r\nRiot acts like bruiser itemization is complicated when in reality, all they need is low offensive items that offer decent durability in return while also providing some form of utility.\r\n\r\nNbm this is riot, I will post a video if  a Lee Sin landing a Q instead and I will have half of the riot staff in here peeing in their pajamas out of excitement for the lcs big play they just watched.","replies":[]}
