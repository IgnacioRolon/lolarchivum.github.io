And the ult upgrade costs way too much, too little of a benefit for such a steep price. I honestly don&#039;t know, they just increased his skill cap by a lot with the potential of his E along side the passive reset with it. They could just need timer reductions at earlier levels, idk. But he just feels kinda ass stat wise.\r\n\r\nBut, I&#039;ll give him this, he has the best auto attack animation of anyone in the game atm.
