Anyone from season 2 remembers the bullshit was Sona/Janna every game. Taric had a short run. Ali had a short run. Literally fuck Blitzcrank. Seriously, if you asked me if I was faced with the prospect of having to see one support in every single game no matter what, I would select Thresh by a mile.\n\nDon&#039;t get me wrong, his kit can be frustrating but there&#039;s literally never a point where I face a Thresh and he makes a play and I say to myself \"welp we couldn&#039;t have done anything about that.\" Meanwhile, Sonas spammable heal + shield (which is still good, quit acting like it isn&#039;t) Janna&#039;s everything, Alistars Malphite ult while being unkillable. Blitzcranks&#039;s existence. Braum...well he&#039;s not too overbearing in lane but teamfights happen and if you&#039;re melee vs a Braum, prepare to never be able to move. Same with Naut. Same with Leona. Fuck Lulu no matter where she goes. Taric is binary as fuck and literally unfun to play against. Soraka doesn&#039;t exist at the moment because I think she&#039;s legitimately the hardest support to play now by far (but heal spammers are still lame). \n\nLike, his damage isn&#039;t really overbearing. There&#039;s some things I don&#039;t understand (like why his hook has to have a fucking stun on it) with him but my god, I never feel like Thresh is nearly as overbearing as all the above when they&#039;re good because they&#039;re all literal bullshit to play against. So while it is a disturbing trend to see a champion like that in every game no matter what the meta is, I&#039;d live with this any day of the week over half the other bullshit support champions that are point and click 1v2 lol bro where&#039;d your health go shitty designs. \n\nSo while this isn&#039;t a hail thresh thread, uh, here ya go thresh, here&#039;s a trophy for not being absolute bullshit like most support champions are.","replies":[{"poster":"jDVL20eCYs","date":"2015-06-22T19:57:39.201+0000","up_votes":50,"down_votes":6,"body":"annie is the worst of all^^ cancer champ of cancers","replies":[{"poster":"manbearswine","date":"2015-06-23T00:45:14.973+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ekko or feed,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VjGKE3gB,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-06-22T19:57:39.201+0000)\n>\n> annie is the worst of all^^ cancer champ of cancers\n\nFine,let's nerf annie,have fun chocking on kalista.\n\nIs annie's kit obnoxious? ...yes,but she is often used to counter champions even more obnoxious than she is(kalista,yasuo/etc),so she is actually healthy for the game,she is just the lesser evil.","replies":[{"poster":"Aeolian Melodies","date":"2015-06-23T00:58:44.540+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"Annie is more often seen WITH Kallista than AGAINST her.\n\nAnnie being picked prevents any non-tank support from being picked and any short range and/or immobile ADC from being picked, and every time she gets a lovetap on the wrist she gets 3 compensatory buffs that make her even more bullshit than before. \n\nLesser evil my fucking ass.","replies":[{"poster":"manbearswine","date":"2015-06-23T01:10:55.511+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Aeolian Melodies,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VjGKE3gB,comment-id=000100010001,timestamp=2015-06-23T00:58:44.540+0000)\n>\n> Annie is more often seen WITH Kallista than AGAINST her.\n\nYes,that's often an issue with counters,but well,if you take annie with kalista,they can't take annie.\n \n> Annie being picked prevents any non-tank support from being picked\n\nNews flash,tank supports do that as well,hell,they are even worse,annie can sort of be handled,nautilus or a good thresh(more as in not bad thresh,thresh is just known for having a lot of shit players playing him for no apparent reason)?

Any day. Give me 10 Threshes before a single Annie.\n\nJanna is my strongest support - both in terms of champion's strength and my personal skill with her - that does not mean that Sona and Nami are worthless.\n\nNami gets played competitively - I don't know where you get the idea that she is not good. Given that half of her kit is skillshot based (and that her most threatening abilities are those skillshots), I also don't understand where you get the idea that she is \"mostly click\". She can't hard CC you without aiming - Annie can. Leona can, if you let her walk to you but then you probably deserve to get stunned.\n\nSona's problem, as it was last season, is not her kit. Her kit is excellent at what it does - bullying lanes with constant poke and coming out on top due to sustain. Sona's problem is the currently popular supports. Out of Janna, Thresh, Leona, Nautilus, Annie, Alistar, Morgana, and Blitzcrank, there's only really Janna and Morgana that I'd want to face, Janna because her lane gets bullied easily by poke, Morgana for how easily Sona goes through Black Shield to allow CC to be applied after.\n\nEven Nami I don't really like to face as Sona because she is more threatening (dem bubbles) and her sustain is bound to be superior because she is meant to max it first. Blitzcrank, Thresh and Leona can be beaten if you are a better player than them; Alistar's already tougher because he has sustain too, making his lane less prone to being bullied and more prone to not giving a fuck. Annie is literally mission impossible unless you have godlike coordination with your ADC and the other lane don't know wtf they're doing.\n\nI personally do not think they should buff Sona. They're going to buff what? Her poke? Her poke is already extremely strong. Her sustain? RIot hates sustain so that's unlikely; even if they were to do it this would likely come with a price to pay, aka her poke would get gutted. Her MS buff? Not going to help her much in the current game environment, plus she maxes this last for a reason. Her ult? Riot hates it - although I suppose a lower CD would be nice, considering the other supports. What they could do and what would probably help her the most without breaking her or having to sacrifice what's currently fun about her would be a buff in the mana/mana regen department (either her pool, her regen, or her abilities' cost, looking at YOU Aria of Perseverance), or a buff to her early game tankiness so she isn't as much of a free kill for those engage supports. With a bit more HP, perhaps she would indeed have a chance against Annie - currently she does not.\n\nTank meta doesn't help her much either, when the enemy has Maokai top, Alistar support, Sejuani jungle and Cho'Gath mid, it's highly unlikely that your team has enough damage to win the teamfight during the duration of Crescendo - and then you're ticking tanks with Q and kiting around with E hoping some bad guys die eventually.\n\nSona is excellent at what she is designed to do - it's just that what she is designed to do isn't what is needed at the moment in the current meta game. \n\nHer biggest problem is how useless she is when her lane/team gets behind. With every other support you feel like you can still control the game; Sona's impact just feels null and void when her team is on the losing side. I just have no idea how Riot can help her there without breaking her, making her too strong, and having to send her through another cycle of 4 nerfs in a row.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-06-24T20:52:25.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well they probably should make putting points into E a little better\nas currently it is each point spent on E only gives her E.. +1% movement speed...","replies":[{"poster":"Aeolian Melodies","date":"2015-06-24T21:32:48.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's hard to achieve that without hitting Q or W hard.

Thresh's kit is an abomination, where he gets to do everything another support is good at, but then gets something else on the side.  I guess he doesn't have a heal, but he can build relic shield like every other non-sustain support to make up for it.  He gets a hook like Blitz, but he can choose whether he wants to take it (even lower risk/high reward), and he gets ranged autos _with an on-hit_ on top of that.  He gets a completely unique/defining spell in lantern that has a shield tacked on for reasons.  He's good at engage, good at disengage, good at lockdown, puts out good damage...  Contrast that with Janna, who has a very well-defined and focused strength - disengage.  People whine about Janna because she punishes aggression, but she can't really do anything to you in any other case.   \n\nI'll agree Sona's poorly designed as a spammy sustain and poke support with an AOE stun ult, but I see her more similar to Thresh for that reason rather than in contrast to him.\n\nThe funny thing about Sona/Janna in S2 is that the playerbase didn't realize the Blitz/Leonas of the game existed, then when they finally did, those champions went on to dominate the lane like they have pretty much ever since (mage supports of S3 aside).","replies":[{"poster":"Hinagiku33","date":"2015-06-24T02:26:37.699+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I never did get the hate on {{champion:40}} , she does exactly one thing - disengage.
