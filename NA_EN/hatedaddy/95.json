Ryze nerfs coupled with that and upcoming Gnar changes mean Nasus will have almost no difficult match-ups with top tier top laners (of Gnar is still considered good, this match-up will still be hell).\r\nRumble is challenging until you get a spirit visage and Nasus can actually out-trade rumble levels 2 and 3 so the match-up is difficult yes, but theres room for him to have success there.\r\n\r\nSo what does that leave? Maokai top is an easy match up. Irelia is a pretty easy match-up. I wouldn't be surprised to see Renekton make a comeback, thats a pretty difficult match-up if the renekton player actually plays him well. Top lane is still in teleport meta, another factor favoring Nasus. Mundo is an easy match-up. Singed is an easy mtch-up (although Singed wrecks Nasus' teamfight).\r\n\r\nIf Nasus becomes good, look at the circumstances that allowed it to happen rather than catering to QQ and pulling the nerf trigger on him when hes taken pretty much all he can withstand. The top lane roster is abysmal currently, that isn't nasus' fault and Riots promise to buff up other top laners in the renekton bar rather than nerf nerf nerf fell through. There are plenty of top laners who can kick nasus' ass when they are good but almost none of them are. And ignite as a top lane spell sucks now, again something that favors Nasus but isn't his fault.\r\n\r\nSo I ask, if this happens and I honestly don't see anything preventing it from happening, be proactive in ways to increase top lane diversity instead of nerfing another one into the ground because the top lane cycle has been nothing but nerf city.\r\n\r\nThanks for the read friends\r\n\r\nRemember, upvoting or downvoting without bumping/commenting is a crime!","replies":[{"poster":"Leafie","date":"2014-11-13T01:54:22.801+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":7,"body":"+1 for requesting Nasus doesn't get nerfed again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"doubleguac","date":"2014-11-13T18:32:48.290+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"I pray to god Nasus doesn't become popular again.\n\nI know a lot of people out there enjoy playing him. And I feel for you.\n\nBut he's *so frustrating* to play against. All Nasus has to do to win a lane is Q minions over and over again. The ball is entirely in the court of his lane opponent: Nasus doesn't need to outplay his opponent to win, all he has to do is play passively and survive.\n\nWhen I get beaten by a Gnar, I can think to myself: \"next time I should pay more attention to his rage bar.\" Or, \"I need to focus on dodging his boomerangs and capitalizing when his hop is down.\" Or, \"my teammates and I shouldn't have fought in jungle, and should have avoided walls better.\" \n\nWhen I get beaten by a Nasus, all I can think to myself is: \"he pressed Q on a lot of minions, then pressed Q on me. Next time, I need to win faster so he doesn't have so much time to press Q on minions.\"\n\nPlaying against Nasus doesn't feel like trying to outsmart and outplay a player; it feels like trying to beat a clock. If you're playing a melee, at some point in the game, he will outscale you. And once that's happened, there is nothing you can do. There's no skills to dodge. There's nothing to bait. You can't \"outplay\" him.

The duration of Nasus' Q active by lasts longer than Garens silence, even his max rank silence. Garens Q is annoying but nothing you can't outsustain and if Garen wants to drop his spin on you, you force him to do it in minion waves then back off, resulting in him pushing you to tower. Then you farm under tower where garens under tower harass is pitiful. \n\nGarens ult only kills Nasus with full execute, which means Nasus simply needs to know around 30% health he has to retreat. Anything above that, he pops ult after garen silence/ult and lives then garens ult goes on cooldown for a year.\n\nWhy is this a farm lane? Generally garen will go one damage item + full tank making it not worth your time to kill him because of how poorly he scales and hes not a threat to you with that build. Garen goes full damage and you literally blow him up because Nasus murders squishy melee top laners. \n\nTrust me, this is an easy match up for nasus, pretty boring actually.

Granted you may have beaten a garen or two. But of the top 3 rated Nasus counters garen is in most if not in all lists. In fact alot of pro's including TheOddOne, Dyrus, and even Ackerman, agree that Garen counters Nasus. This isn't me saying ooo Garen is cool, no this is professional statistics and experts in the game saying this. \n\n\nThe main reason though that garen counters susan so hard, isn't because of his kit, granted his ult does help. Its mainly the fact that his early levels are significantly stronger than nasus, where in the long run susan will eventually out scale him. Garens goal isn't to hit 90cs by 10 mins, no his goal is make make sure nasus has less than 10 cs per 10 by forcing him out of lane. and he can achieve this soley because he wins early game. Thats why if you do play nasus, junglers tend to gank top alot more often that other lanes. Because if you get Nasus through his weak early game he carries the rest of the game.\n\nAnd Not to toot my own horn, I've beaten diamond ranked nasus players with garen, and Im no pro, Im silver league last time i played ranked.\n\nSome Champ Counters sites:\nhttp://www.championselect.net/champions/nasus\nhttp://elohell.net/league-of-legends-counterpicks/nasus-counters\nhttp://www.picklol.net/nasus","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vellich0r","date":"2014-11-14T20:04:07.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am used to playing against low skill nasus players, so that may be whats swaying my vote.","replies":[{"poster":"HateDaddy","date":"2014-11-14T22:36:00.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I am used to playing against low skill nasus players, so that may be whats swaying my vote.\n\nIf Garen works for you, continue to play him.

He is a great CC tank, but there are others that provide slightly less CC (i'm talking like 15% compared to a 10%), but provide a lot more damage and in turn are better.

If a champion has no difficult matchups, but acts themself as a difficult matchup for many, then how is this considered fair and fun to the other guy playing top?\n\nThis is a good post and I'll explain why it's wrong. \n\nWhen you break down his kit, let's be honest: is it really OP? Very limited trading early, poor AD, poor base scaling stats, worst mana pool in the game, second worst base mana regen in the game, 10% lifesteal lvl 1-7 basically means he's getting roughly 5-6 hp back per auto, which isn't that good. His sustain early matters, but 1-7, his sustain is mostly HP pot/HP regen based meaning his trading isn't directly sustaining him much, if at all. Easily peeled, easily kited, no mobility. Sure, he has a lot of strengths, but when we break down his kit, there's no way in hell he is OP.\n\nAs far as him winning counter match-ups? I suspect people just don't know how to play against sustain lanes anymore, hence all the Maokai QQ. But, in fairness to those people, anti-sustain has become beaten to shit so hard because Riot has nerfed fighters who bully lane (thus, slowing down sustain) or discouraged anyone from picking them at any point. \n\nPoint is, Nasus is only in this spot because everything else has been nerfed to the ground that he simply just rises from the ashes once again. This is the nerf cycle that has been top lane for the last two seasons. That was the point of the Renekton Bar, to stop nerfing everything but buffing everything else. That gave J4 and Rumble decent buffs, Zac could probably use a few more and they overbuffed Ryze. Since then, what? How many top laners have been buffed since then? Instead of nerfing over and over again and at what point do you begin asking yourself \"are we destroying this lane because we nerf everything to shit that goes up there?\" The answer is simply yes, they have gutted an entire class and even nerfed more champions who were already nerfed who went up there (nerfed mid laners who went top like Kayle, Lulu, etc). Again, is that really Nasus fault? No. And if Riot increased the diversity in top lane instead of killing off contenders (like they did with Gragas for no reason), Nasus would be right in the middle of the pack. Singed buffs were welcome but that's not enough. \n\nThe next part is itemization and favorable metas. The meta will favor Nasus, nobody in top lane is high in damage currently aside from Irelia and Nasus counters her. TP is really strong. D-Shield will be strong. Here is what happened in the past: riot overbuffed items, spells and masteries. Then riot nerfed champions who synergized well with them, then to kick them in the dick even further, Riot then nerfed the items, spells and masteries, further nerfing that champion. I've seen this before, I suspect it will happen again but maybe this time if we say \"uh hey Riot, don't do that shit,\" maybe for the first time, they will actually think about the shit they do and how it could impact things in the future rather than being \"hur dur fire ze mizzle du nerf.\" Probably not though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2014-11-13T12:03:28.864+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:86}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:5}} \n\nThese guys all say Hi.","replies":[{"poster":"ploki122","date":"2014-11-14T00:37:49.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Phew, someone did list Poppy...","replies":[{"poster":"HateDaddy","date":"2014-11-14T00:44:29.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Phew, someone did list Poppy...\n\nI am going to not speak on counters because my perspective is massively skewed.

A goodPoppy will start getting ahead around her 2nd cs. Basically, her Q does more damage than your early on and whenever you will go for a trade, she will trade back, hard (AA+Q). You can choose to Q her but that meas you don't get your stack (and she still outtrades you)\n\nThen. since she's winning the level, she should be able to push you in ever so slightly and get level 2 first. With her level 2 (Q+E),she can kll you from roughly 40-50 % if she can land her sun. Meaning that you will probably miss another few cs there. Once you are both level 2, Nasus can either shove back the lane using Spirit of Fire, or outduel her using Wither. The problem is that he cannot do both. So even at level 2, she will have the advantage, either pushing you in and applying pressure elsewhere or outdueling you (same way as level 1).\n\nLevl 3 is a bit staler, both are roughly even. Level 4-5 you start to raise on top again, since your Q once again outdamages his (by far), and your AAs also deal more damage, leading to better trades unless he Qs more often than you. Level 6, you start \"losing\" the lane, since he can push you back in and even kill you if you misplay thanks to his ult, however if you played the early phase well, you should be ahead at this point and you should've bought a Sheen already, making the death threat work both way. This become a skill matchup with an edge to Poppy at this point (mostly because of her hybrid damages, where Nasus probably bought Glacial Shroud or is working toward Spirit Visage).\n\nCome late game, by the time Nasus is big, he has to try and outpush a BotRK-Hydra-Triforce Poppy. Sure, he will most probably outduel you if neither uses their ults, but as soon as anyone comes into the lane, it favors Poppy, and as soon as either of you teleports, it favors Poppy (given equally good Teleports). You can try to take another lane, but nothing except Nasus on your team will be able to deal with a Teleport Poppy, and if she ever chooses to group, she can ult your ADc, and wreck your mid laner, while you'Re trying to do the same to hers. Unfortunately, Nasus isn't a great burster, especially not 1v2-3+.","replies":[{"poster":"HateDaddy","date":"2014-11-14T01:25:16.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Any Poppy that loses top lane vs Nasus without completely skewed map pressure (aka lots more ganks coming from Nasus jungler/mid laner than Poppy's, ot Poppy roaming while Nasus doesn't) simply doesn't understand how to play Poppy. A goodPoppy will start getting ahead around her 2nd cs. Basically, her Q does more damage than your early on and whenever you will go for a trade, she will trade back, hard (AA+Q). You can choose to Q her but that meas you don't get your stack (and she still outtrades you)\n> \n> Then. since she's winning the level, she should be able to push you in ever so slightly and get level 2 first. With her level 2 (Q+E),she can kll you from roughly 40-50 % if she can land her sun. Meaning that you will probably miss another few cs there. Once you are both level 2, Nasus can either shove back the lane using Spirit of Fire, or outduel her using Wither. The problem is that he cannot do both.

This is a match up where I actually attempt to afk split push and force people top, I don't want to get into 5v5s with a poppy on the other side because theres no way nasus shuts her down early and even if I kill her in solo lane mid game, shes already started to scale well. Theres probably a small window of opportunity to outperform her in team fights at that point mid game, anything after that goes to Poppy.","replies":[{"poster":"Enraged Piglet","date":"2014-11-14T16:37:29.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"most poppies start flask so that they can have bigger mana pool/sustain and the matchup he's talking about is with teleport and most poppies take ignite so that the already good lvl 2 becomes impossible for nasus and so he misses all those cs and lvl 3 and on is still good for poppy because your missing all the cs and you have more kill potential and if pushed higher lvl and if not pushed it's still good since that is good for ganking nasus. Also the person above was talking about nasus having to use wither or spirit fire but poppy can avoid that with her E if needed eitehr by using on minion or on nasus himself. Also poppy can litterally build Triforce/Bork and then pure defense and she will destroy nasus because he builds about all tank but poppies Q does 8% max health damage in magic and then a lot of ad damage as well especially with bork and your wither won't work as well in escaping or chasing 1v1 because of bork active If your jungler ganks all poppy has to do is ult one of you and then pick a target to kill and in most cases is at least a 1 for 1.\n\nSo poppy vs nasus looks like this\n- laning phase no farm nasus\n- even with farm poppy wins mid game she just ults someone on your team with low cc and kills either a carry or yourself. Even if she builds all damage unless her target can kill her she effectively becomes an invisible front liner that your carries can't go through. Even if poppy can't kill an enemy carry her Q does so much damage to you and she's still invisible because of her ult so she beats you. Even if your entire team has cc she can still ult you and buy boots of swiftness. You would be forced to fight her and then both teams would be focusing poppy or nasus for the most part and unless you somehow got far ahead of her and can almost instant kill her at best if would be equal teamfighting. Or poppy can get merc shoes and still be fine in most cases.\n-late game unless as mentioned the nasus somehow got far ahead mid game and shut down the poppy, the poppy just outright wins teamfights with her ult and even if your way ahead she can still do loads of damage to you with Q and peel you of her allies.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Enraged Piglet","date":"2014-11-14T16:21:41.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that's bs she has a way better early game then nasus. For instance poppy beats riven pre 6 and she has a lot of kill potential and that's why most poppies run ignite. Her Q litterally beats you face so hard that you wouldn't believe nasus was a dog. I mean all poppy has to do is go either dorans blade or flask (for the manna) and just Q you every single time you get within 5 feet of the creep wave. HEr abilities also don't push which is also bad for nasus since he wants the wave frozen at his tower and then even if you get it frozen at your tower it doesn't really matter after 6 since even if your jungler ganks and you wither her she just ults one of you and kills the other or just tower dives you and even pre 6 her Q hits you so hard it's not worth getting hit for most the cses and if poppy really wants she can take tp and then even if she fails to deny you cs like she should be doing she still does better then you in teamfights.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2014-11-13T02:53:50.437+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, but you did leave out a few match ups.
