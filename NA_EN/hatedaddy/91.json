So yeah... it was a complete trap back then.\n\nNow you have BotRK that has 40% AS, 25 AD, 6% Current HP on hit, 10% lifesteal, and an active that steals 10% max HP AND 25% MS from target for 3400.\n\n\nThe new Bloodrazor enchantment gives 40% AS and 3% Max HP Physical damage On Hit for 1625 (+1000 for base item). So this isn't a noob trap. It's for AS junglers like Yi, WW, Kindred, etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shadow Hazard","date":"2016-05-12T06:03:38.303+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You realize sated was a wits end on steroids without the MR.","replies":[{"poster":"HateDaddy","date":"2016-05-12T06:30:39.561+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Shadow Hazard,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vFVAteHv,comment-id=000b,timestamp=2016-05-12T06:03:38.303+0000)\n>\n> You realize sated was a wits end on steroids without the MR.\n\nwits end doesn't give you phantom on hit \n\nThat's honestly what broke the item more than anything","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tobias Brackner","date":"2016-05-12T03:48:26.266+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wits End is awesome.\n\nI build it on Bruisers who want AS (and some supp) since it gives dmg, resistance, and helps ally AP too.\n\nIt's HILARIOUS on Trundle.","replies":[{"poster":"DemainaNyx","date":"2016-05-12T06:28:52.938+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Had a teammate flame me on ARAM for building it on Teemo.
