She's still relatively immobile but she has ways to deal with it and she has CC and kiting/chasing for days.\n\nI really want to know how they measure the success of a champion early game. Quite frankly, she's not easy to play so I would look at those stats and only use them as evidence for so much. She's oppressive as shit early, saying she's not is retarded. And she shits on most assassins actually, because she can kite/cc them and bully them early when they're weak. Leblanc might be an exception. Not to mention she can also go top lane where she bullies everything in existence not named Irelia.\n\nTo be honest, I think those numbers don't mean much of anything because you're pointing at early game winrate, which is something that is impacted by so much shit outside of the champions control. And as I noted, like Leblanc, Cass is hard as shit to play. I suspect most people are just bad with her, yes even in higher elo. \n\nAnd Xerath would be safe vs her but I seriously don't see him shutting her down, sorry.","replies":[{"poster":"Orangesilk","date":"2015-04-25T15:51:04.297+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might be doing something wrong, did you look at the site I posted?, It points out her winrate in games that end before the 25 min mark, and in games that end before the 35 min mark. If you look at those numbers, they are really low, which suggests her laning power is weak and she rarely gets to snowball, compare this to Pantheon, he is a true bully, and accordingly, his winrate for short games is very high.\n\nThe site I posted is diamond league data, people don't get to diamond playing champions they don't know how to play. If you feel oppressed by her early game you might be doing something wrong, because empirical evidence points against her early game being strong, in fact her winrate is mostly because of those 40+ min games where she becomes, understandably, insane.\n\nIn the toplane she's at her weakest, because her immobility and lack of CC means she has little to do when ganked, and since toplane is a long lane, she won't make it to tower before dying. (Lane length is the main reason why escapeless mages go mid, the more you know) This means that ANY char can snowball off her.\n\nWinrate is impacted by lots of things, but over a large enough sample those things cancel eachother out.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"meatjunjun","date":"2015-04-25T07:57:34.231+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"You forget that if she misses her Q, she has no damage what-so-ever.\n\nAlso take into consideration her power-spike.

You saying she's short when her spells ranges are 850, 700, 800 and 825 respectively. That's not short ranged. Mordekaiser is short ranged, Ryze is short ranged, Vlad is short ranged. You saying she's ccless and implying she has no way to deal with mobility when she does. Cass can literally kite everything, especially once she gets a rylais.
