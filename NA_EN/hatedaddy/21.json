The grounds I stood on concering that was going to starting itemization that favors Nasus while the top lane roster is generally weak. My message was mainly that other top laners need buffs and Nasus will naturually fall in line (I also anticipate ignite buffs or tp nerfs in the future, both hurt Nasus). Long story short, the weaker top lane roster simply needs buffed and Nasus will fall in line, preventing another champion from being nerfed unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nWhat I didn't consider was the upcoming hp and hp regen stat changes. I will be blunt here, I simply don't understand them and how it impacts all the champions overall - we are seeing champions base health being buffed on pbe and I have had it explained to me that is the reason why. Concerning base stats, Nasus has some of the worst including the worst starting mana pool of any champ (I last checked on the yasuo patch, needless to say Yasuo isn't a contender there) and one of the worst base mana regen stats. His starting HP and hp regen were pretty average if I recall correctly but I am wondering if that impacts him with the changes and if it does, how so? Furthermore, do you find Nasus in general to be problematic with these changes or does he kind of just chill there without much changing?\r\n\r\nI hope you guys can get back to me on this one, i would appreciate it. Thanks friends.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Reinboom","date":"2014-11-19T05:21:16.180+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the context of any given champion individually, it depends on what you build.\nIf up til level 6 you built HP/MP Regen, you will be effected. Your standard build path during that window will be worse overall.\nIf you built HP/MP Regen later, each smaller step on the way will be stronger.\n\nThe exact level this crosses for which stat depends on the champion, which is why there's a bunch of base health and mana regen changes with the new patch. \nFor Nasus...\nEarly Health Regen items are stronger on Nasus at level 3 or greater than on live. Early Mana Regen items are weaker on Nasus until about level 11.\n\n\nNo matter how you play him, don't take this as a direct nerf or buff. Many of your lane matchups will also be incidentally getting weaker or stronger in relation to every other change. It will take a bit for the dust to settle and then we can change things as they need.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HateDaddy","date":"2014-11-19T02:05:10.007+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow friends, don't downvote me without commenting :(","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2014-11-19T17:25:06.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Wow friends, don't downvote me without commenting :(\n\nOne thing I don't like about these forums is people don't do that enough.
