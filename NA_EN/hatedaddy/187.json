Still debating on that one..\r\n\r\nFact is, this countries education system is fucked and one of the biggest areas I notice this is with math. I actually find math to be extremely important in the development of the brain at young, impressionable ages. And while I&#039;ve never been great at it myself, I&#039;ve never actually taken the time to get good at it aside from my senior year when I finally had a good math teacher. And I aced the class. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m also really good at relating with folks and conveying my teachings coherently and clearly. I want to do something to be impactful and while underpaid and under appreciated with great stress, the positives outweighs the negatives and I&#039;m pretty excited to meet with an advisor in December to take my ass back to school ten years later.\r\n\r\nfuck tryndamere","replies":[]}
