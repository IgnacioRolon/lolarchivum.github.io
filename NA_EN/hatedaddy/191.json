They don't get banned, their comments don't get deleted but I do. When someone, as an example, calls me a delusional cancer Nasus main, that is being a jerk. This should be deleted. When I call them brain damaged bronze, this too is being a jerk and it should be deleted. see, thing is, the first example didn't get deleted/removed. The second one got removed and I got banned for a day.\n\nSo please tell your mods to leave me alone. I'm usually pretty chill, I simply only reply back to flamers that your mods seldom do anything about for some reason. I know I've got quite a few \"don't be a jerk\" warnings (most of them are a joke anyway) and I'm trying to avoid being permabanned. So in short, leave me alone. I'm not bothering anyone that didn't throw the first stone. Kthxbai.","replies":[]}
