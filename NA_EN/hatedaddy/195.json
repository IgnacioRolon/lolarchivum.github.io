I don't know if that will change with the full move to boards, but I hope it does. Lcs focuses on everything reddit so the majority of the references they make to the community are reddit based, that too is frustrating.\n\nI don't actually hate Reddit because by in large I find it very uninteresting as talking to people theres feels like interacting with drones. I enjoy leauge communities here because people have personality, even if its a personality I don't care for.\n\nI really hope with the move to boards, Riot prioritizes interaction with their actual community here over reddit, as it should be.","replies":[]}
