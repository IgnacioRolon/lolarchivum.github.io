Why is there a random plat II in my game? \n\nThe thing is, I didn&#039;t actually feed in lane. My jungler and mid came top and literally gave Gnar 3 kills pre-6 and he also got first blood before minions spawn when Elise decided to go into the enemy jungle alone. I did well all things considered, but everyone literally fed their asses off. \n\nCan I blame them though with this horrendous match-making? Like literally what the fuck is this? And why did I lose 17 LP for playing against players who are rated as being much better than me? This fucking system needs to be changed, your match-making shouldn&#039;t be putting me in these kind of games. That has no shot in hell at being a competitive game, even if it somehow managed to be in my favor with all those different ranks in one game. \n\nThis was a joke.
