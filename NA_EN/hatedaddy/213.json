Outside of that, she was still incredibly squishy until she got a boat load of CDR and AD for her shield to be spammable and huge with its scaling. So any armor stacking bruiser would just maul her by level 7 or so. \r\n\r\nThat's not really the case anymore. I really didn't think it'd be that great on her because of how she preferred the early pen from brut but it's r%%%%%ed. It's not hard for her to farm the gold for it and once she completes it, she stacks the shread so fast and she's got 20% CDR on top of that with a boatload of health. It's honestly fucking r%%%%%ed. Thank God most Riven players are terrible but they should probably nerf her instead of the item just because of her existence. That is all.","replies":[]}
