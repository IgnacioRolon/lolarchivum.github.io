If you can't dodge one skill shot, then that's not the champions fault. That's like arguing that Lux's kit is an issue because she lands 1 q and you insta-die to her Q+E+R combo, you didn't dodge Lux's q. \n\nAlso, the whole point of building items in this game is to counterplay people. If you lack a tank on your team to go against an Akali or your players don't choose to CC her, then your entire team of squishy champs is probably gonna die. Top lane was meant for tanks/bruisers... not this current bs where ADCS and AP mages are topping. It's part of the reason the meta is so ridiculous. \n\nAlso, she is an assassin, if you are soloing against her, you are likely to die. The assassins main focus is to flank the enemy back line (Squishy champions), and if you have no front line while facing her in lane, you have a less likely chance to win trades. \n\nWhat will be solution to her kit, even without removing her R STUN, Obscurity, or her q heal is to remove the extended range on her passive and the movement speed she receives when it activates. That's the only thing in her kit that I see problematic.","replies":[{"poster":"MetalStaszek","date":"2019-09-15T08:44:20.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=50CaliberHecate,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1tqgeKWu,comment-id=00010003000000000000,timestamp=2019-09-15T00:23:30.825+0000)\n>\n> \"Every other champion has 1 item that makes them less useful\" that is not true at all. \n> {{champion:81}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:555}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:141}} I can't think of one item that could completely counter these champions. \n> \nYasuo is heavily countered by randuin,\nCho is countered by warmog and together with sion is vulnerable to botrk and bloodrazor\nWarmog is also good against pyke\nIf you fight red kayn, then grievous wounds counter him, if blue you counter him the same way you fight zed talon, etc (phantom dancer, sterak, and other anti assasin items)\nAbout ezreal, he is hybrid, like akali, so its hard to itemize against him, but I'd say deadmans works good against him","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"HateDaddy","date":"2019-09-14T07:26:23.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=50CaliberHecate,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1tqgeKWu,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-09-14T07:08:50.585+0000)\n>\n> Ok but like she's been completely nerfed to the ground at this point that you're legit asking to basically remove her ability to auto.
