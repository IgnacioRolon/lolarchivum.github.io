This shit is such a terrible design - you should never have a mechanic that punishes people for doing well.\n\nTo clarify, I realize killing Garen alone doesn’t make you the villain. But the moment you’ve taken the lead you’ve gotten from killing him and apply it somewhere else, you are going to be made the villain. And eventually you’ll be confronted with dealing with him as the villain and he’ll melt you before you can even do anything to him because of silence + true damage burst. Not to mention, this is just a bad mechanic in general that ends up being anti-melee or useless. If the ranged ADC becomes villain, there’s a good chance Garen won’t even touch them - all the more reason to remove it and give him something better and easier to balance.

His down side being he's easier to kite.\n\n> yeah he has free armor pen just for lvling E\n\nThis is my biggest problem with dari, however this doesn't mean anything as it doesn't affect his ultimate.\n\nThey're both easier to kite than garen as they don't have the speed boosts and cleanses he does. \nDarius' does deal significantly less damage without 5 passive stacks (as he loses the potential double dmg and the scaling from noxian might). And can be reacted to since it has a reasonable animation time: with an invul spell eg vlad, ekko. An hourglass if that suits the build or by stunning him. \nThese methos generally won't work for garen as it's pretty much instant.\n\nThe problem raised in OP isn't that it deals true damage period, it's that it deals true damage against you because you got a kill. It punishes you for doing well, and rewards garen for either playing poorly, or doing nothing at all (say u kill the jungler)\n\nAny other true damage champ be it {{champion:161}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:114}}, they deal the true damage regardless. They don't punish you for killing someone and they generally deal less damage due to it being less reliable (even cho is included here as he doesn't have the gap closing capabilities garen has)\n\n\nGaren's ult is \"Oh you killed me? Well now I get a special bonus to help me kill you next time\".\n\nIf you want to give him true damage that's fine. Make his ult a true damage execution always. Lower the base damage, remove the passive interaction (scaling with garens health) and lower the execution scaling (enemies missing health). I;'d be fine with that.\nBut he shouldn't be given a boost for doing badly or nothing at all","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"General Matty","date":"2018-09-12T17:21:23.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Amumu has true damage due to his passive effect.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"NemeBro","date":"2018-09-12T06:52:52.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrFawknSunshine,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=JFYzA0No,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-09-12T01:50:10.006+0000)\n>\n> oh you mean like shut down gold and 4 sec death timers?\n\nEveryone benefits from those, and those don't punish a player for playing well and getting ahead, they punish an ahead player for making a mistake.\n\nTerrible comparison.

This is the Direction I would Like to see.\n\n#1. Make the Villain Mechanic tied to Q, but increase Q CD by 3-5s. So that Q marks the target as the villain for 5 seconds. Keep the scaling/availability tied to R. Killing the Villain Resets Q.\n\nThis Kinda kills 2 birds with 1 stone. 1 Nerfing the Q up-time, giving more Counter-play while its on CD, and making it so the Villain Mechanic is no longer more of an RNG thing and its more controlled. It also gives Garen a reward for Killing the Villain, and makes it so that Garen can not just Flash > R the Villain, it will require set up.\n\nIMO the mechanic needs to stay in some form or fashion, as Garen has no way of dealing with Tanks other than hoping they are the Villain atm.\n\n#2. Give E AS scaling, this should already be a thing honestly. \n\nThis opens up more building paths for Garen while not actually buffing Tank/bruiser Garen\n\n#3. Change his Passive to a shielding mechanic along the lines of: Hitting enemies builds stacks of Perseverance, at 100 stacks Garen gains a shield for a % of his Max HP for X seconds, at the end of the duration Garen is healed for 50% of the remaining shield. Hitting enemy champions and large/epic monsters gives more stacks. Stacks fall off slowly while out of combat. \n\nI would use his resource bar to show his current stack %. And this would give Garen a passive that is actually useful for fighting and dueling with, and move away from the \"Run in trade, sit back and heal\" aspect that is Garen. As a Garen main I feel his passive is utterly useless early game (can easily be constantly poked to keep it off, and its actual regen is pretty much shit.) and completely broken post 11, where I constantly tower-dive to 10% HP run away and have it all back in a matter of a few seconds. If you cant kill Garen Post 11 before he can escape, then its pointless even attacking him as he will have full HP in a few seconds and will be running back in at you.
