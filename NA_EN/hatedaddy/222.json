Clear jungle, press R - win games. He's already the most braindead skill-less champion in the game, it makes it worse when he's one of the best. There's literally nothing you can do, he just catches you out with R currently and 100-0's you, doesn't even have to teamfight, just look for picks.","replies":[]}
