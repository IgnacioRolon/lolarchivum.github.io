It does currently allow him to function in a range of lanes he'd otherwise really struggle in however, so not personally seeing a need to change it right now.\n\nThe problem I feel with changing Nasus so he has to fight more is well, he can't. Right? Like, his whole focus is going to be spending the CD of his Q trying to farm. His E? Costs too much mana. It's insane on the mana cost, especially since it's weak as fuck. Then his W is his bread and butter (even more so than his Q) which allows him to even function as a melee threat.\n\nThere's no room in his kit to reward being aggressive as Nasus, and just outright nerfing him on his passive is silly since that would be cherry picking. It would be like throwing a dart at a board and saying \"c'ya Nasus until a season+ from now where we give you help, if even!\"\n\nThe champion is designed around passive play, and while some could call that toxic, I could just as easily say hyper aggressive top laners like Riven or Lissandra or Darius are even more \"toxic\". It'd rather lane vs a Nasus than a Riven or Lissandra any day of the year. I think having champions that do different things is fine. And in Nasus's case, he tries to farm, and has a passive that tries to assist in that.\n\nNerfing the mana cost on his E might be something that is explored, but again, it's not a good ability. It's pretty crap, actually, and if you remove part or all of his passive then dump something on his E to make it an actual ability, you're probably just going to create a whole 'nother problem.\n\nI think on the list of 'champions that need change/nerfs' though, Nasus is very, VERY far at the bottom of that list. The fact he's brought up over many other problematic or neglected champions (to me) shows you aren't paying attention to the game. Sorry to throw you under the bus there. Personally, I play him a bit (not tons) but I've played as and against him enough to warrant he's (frankly) not that bad. I also feel even when ahead, if his team falls slightly behind, he struggles to really carry and is easily just CCed and killed. So, for that reason, I wouldn't even consider him that amazing of a soloq pick. I don't think he's weak, mind you. He has his place, but it has never crossed my mind he's too strong. This is the first time in almost a year where the meta is FINALLY in his favour. That doesn't mean you need to instantly cut him down again. Once you guys tone down the tank meta a bit, I assure you he'll be back into the darkness without even needing a nerf.\n\n\n\n\nWhat about top laners building jungle items? Sejuani? Evelynn? Warwick? Poppy (who you plan on turning into a tank LOL), Mundo?, Malzahar, Quinn, Shen, Singed, Trundle, Yorick, Bard, Jayce, Gangplank, Miss Fortune, Elise, Aniva, Kennen, Darius?\n\nThese are all champions that either need buffs, nerfs, changes, complete reworks all way more than Nasus.

I mean it's an empowered auto, and it affects towers. So you'd need to find some way to make what is currently (obviously) a melee ability into a ranged skillshot (unless it's possible for an ability to be a melee skillshot, I can't think of any?). And you'd also need to find a way to make it a ranged skillshot that affects towers.\n\nPersonally I don't like the idea of Nasus shredding carries and towers from range, nor farming from range. And I can't quite think of a way to make something a skillshot while also being melee. Closest I think think of is Nidalee's Swipe but that's still pretty impossible to miss and AOE to boot.\n\nI mean there are just so many problems here. Nasus is a melee fighter, he fights at point blank range. At point blank range I don't think it's actively possible to miss a skillshot, so there's basically zero chance of a Q missing regardless :/ Am I missing something?

Every single skill he has, while having some defensive power (his ults flat health gain, wither as an escape tool [weak as it may be]) is pretty offensive oriented. \n\nThe % damage on ult is designed to reward an immobile melee champion for being in the middle of a team and fighting, same with the bonus AD. Renekton doesn't have this because Renekton isn't immobile, Renekton has 3 abilities that scale with AD and Renektons power is focused on early game, not late. These also give him more versatility overall as hes immobile so there are some teams he simply can't do much against in terms of damage, so at least he can offer some form of utility and front lining power. Asking why he has this is a bit silly, every champion has power invested in their kits in some manner similar to this.\n\n@Meddler, given the tank meta, Nasus is decent for lane phase. There aren't really many tanks who can shut him down in lane. But they make his life a living hell in teamfights, etc. So id say his split pushing and farming power might be stronger but with beefy front liners ccing him forever, there's still a lot of potential to shut him down in fights. I'm not asking for buffs, I'm happy with him currently.

While Veigar wants to last-hit with his Q as much as possible, he does so in the middle lane where the entire enemy team has fairly quick access to him and can attempt to shut him down if he's ahead, while the effectiveness of Thresh's souls tapers past a certain point, and Sion doesn't need to do anything in particular to farm up health/scales infinitely in a defensive way (it exists more as a bonus than \"I must do this, this is my entire character\")/has a kit that revolves around interaction with enemies rather than self-preservation. \n\nNasus, on the other hand, scales offensively with his Q (so Nasus players who are not steamrolling are likely to feel that they haven't farmed \"enough\"), lives in the isolated top lane which requires the entire enemy team to go far out of their way to stop him from farming (which isn't easy, considering he has a lot of tools to prevent people from killing him), and due to the nature of his kit, benefits more from having enemies come to him than chasing after them and thus has no real reason to pursue interaction with enemies until the game's almost done. While you might say \"Well, a good Nasus would know not to farm forever and would interact with his team when they need him,\" you need to keep in mind that kits communicate with players, by outlining the behaviors their mechanics encourage, enable, and reward--so this interaction is a result of a good player, not good design.\n\nHowever, Nasus's patient \"last-hit with Q as much as possible\" gameplay in lane is pretty interesting in the context of matchups, so I think eventually, a good way to [adjust his gameplay](http://rfmelley.wix.com/lolredesignproject#!nasus/cx6i) while maintaining his flavor would be to turn that Q stacking minigame into something with much more frequent decisions and rewards that also allows the player to feel like they're playing Nasus \"right\" while interacting with the rest of their team and the enemy team as early as the laning phase, while still rewarding enemies for keeping him away from his farm.","replies":[]},{"poster":"4NoxiousHours","date":"2015-04-14T17:44:05.293+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HWbXw037,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-04-14T06:26:26.986+0000)\n>\n> We're pretty happy with him overall.

It's also worth noting the current meta should be pretty favorable to Nasus (longer fights, some other top laners that also want to farm a lot) which probably gives him a bit of a boost right now.\n\nHi Meddler.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DEmperor95","date":"2015-04-14T06:38:20.670+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I honestly think that the window of opportunity to shut down a Nasus in the early game is quite limited, and should be expanded. His early game weaknesses are almost completely mitigated very early on; he has immense sustain with his passive, and he becomes a lot stronger/tankier after his first back and getting level 6, allowing him to do whatever he wants.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Theorchero","date":"2015-04-14T06:30:46.984+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"inb4 wither skillshot","replies":[{"poster":"qetzel","date":"2015-04-14T09:03:57.284+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah...

You have very poor wave clear, so if the enemy is able to establish a lane freeze you are so vulnerable to the gank that their jungler is just waiting for. Everyone knows you have to punish Nasus all the time, you have to out play him mentally. Obviously Nasus players aren't foolish either, but you need to find way to make him have low stacks early. I know for me, I always like to shoot for 350 minimum preferably 450 stacks by 20 minutes. If someone is able to deny me hard and I'm at like 200, I feel like I've failed already.
