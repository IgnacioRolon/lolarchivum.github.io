Part of it is scaling, the other part of it is who gives a shit about you after 20 minutes. \n\nEven great scaling top laners like Jax, Nasus and Tryndamere never want to leave lane because the moment they try to team fight, a support presses one button on them and makes them useless. So if this is the fate of a hard scaling top laner in team fights, why bother playing anything else at all? And if these guys suck at team fighting as hard scaling champions, why bother picking them? Lissandra and Gnar are just two examples, there's several champions who can go top as a ranged laner and scale like a fucking God and no melee can fuck with them.","replies":[{"poster":"Knight Devout","date":"2014-12-16T08:42:21.133+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, at least Riot is trying to add ranged toplaners champion to that list.\n\nBuffing renekton early (because at this point either you pick a ranged vs him or he'll eat your face ), nerfing Jayce w.\n\nLategame nothing changes, both will be trash and it will be a \"beat the adf first\" game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Old Man Teeto","date":"2014-12-16T11:59:02.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've actually found Gragas jungle works okay this season.\n\nOnly problem is you need your first blue buff so if they invade and you can't get a blue trade your boned.","replies":[{"poster":"AbodyHUN666","date":"2014-12-16T18:25:08.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really?

Because bruisers no matter how you slice it are pseudo casters, even Jax and Irelia fit that bill. They don't pure DPS with crit and armor pen, so naturally the base damage on their abilities are higher because they depend on those abilities more than they do their auto attacks. Ranged adcs typically have lower base damages on abilities or simply lack rotation in spells (thus lower based damages on abilities) because of how they tend to build. So yes, of course bruisers will rely more on base damages. And when people who play squishy champions complain about base damage bruisers killing them, my reply is simple: base offense is beating base defense because we know adcs aren't itemizing past 1 defensive item. I would say the same for mages but they randomly get mr, armor and health galore thrown into their items with amazing utility and CDR. I better slow down, holy malvolene will come in here and tell me double ap should be the standard and that ap items suck","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bodkins Odds","date":"2014-12-18T04:02:17.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talamare,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=eYQolhtV,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2014-12-15T17:56:03.622+0000)\n> I would really appreciate a global +100 Health to more or less every Melee Champion\n\nEspecially Mundo. {{champion:36}}  /jk","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"metaworldpeace10","date":"2014-12-15T17:57:31.581+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Konidias,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=eYQolhtV,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2014-12-15T17:47:16.926+0000)\n> Getting real tired of hearing melee tops complain about ranged tops...

Much skill!\n> \n> What OP wants is to have great damage, the most tanking power in the game, and also somehow be able to trade evenly with squishy ranged champs. It's such a troll request.\n> \n> Plus we have summoner spells that can help melee to close the gap. If you know ranged has burned their flash, you now can just flash on top of them and deal all your crazy damage and tank everything.\n> \n> Or maybe use ghost and run right through minions no problem?\n\nAnd why do you think every top lane is a farm fest now? Fighter itemization is garbage so everyone but Irelia builds full tank and theres no point in going aggro because of teleport\n\nEven if you manage to whittle down Maokai as Darius and maybe even kill him, he'll just keep teleporting back to lane, farming and outscaling you without doing shit\n\nThen in a teamfight you get kited and he sits in the enemy team soaking damage far better than you\n\nAnd you don't seem to understand ranged matchups at all so Ill spell it out for you\n\n**Why do ranged champs auto win lane matchups that arent Irelia while also outscaling them?**\n\nAnd no, you don't walk through the wave. You get crushed by the wave and peeled/dashed away from by the ranged top laner","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"crippler38","date":"2014-12-16T03:13:57.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:82}} never lose laning phase again, although this isn't exactly a fair solution it's very viable, he can out poke and sustain, as well as push the lane so far they can't do anything, if you're smart with wards you can evade ganks and if you're REALLY lucky you might be able to score a double kill due to the jungler or laner coming in when your ult is up, just pop one and be immortal for the other.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"StuffedTurkey007","date":"2014-12-16T07:19:47.561+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unit collision is way too OP right now.

Riven, Irelia, Fiora, and Renekton are good examples of melees that can deal with ranged champions, even mobile ones. Seriously, have you ever tried to lane a squishy ranged champion vs Irelia? Once she gets a few levels it's almost impossible to stay out of her effective engagement zone. And with someone like Riven even if you get into range with 20% remaining health you'll just smash their face in with your burst, same with Fiora except that she can actually heal back up with her ult.\nIt's your fault if you blind picked a slow and kitable slugger like Darius, Nasus, or the new Sion. It's obvious that you're going to get counterpicked by a ranged champion because almost no melee will be able to outfight you with all the free damage and stats you get.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2014-12-15T21:49:47.245+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ranged champs bringing you down?
