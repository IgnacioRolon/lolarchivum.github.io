I simply want to make it clear before hand that I&#039;m aware of that but it&#039;s hard to convey my thoughts on the topic in one small title. I beg of you to consider actually reading. I&#039;m not sure why that&#039;s become such a lost art these days. Actually I am, the degenerates of Reddit are to blame but that&#039;s another topic. Moving on..\r\n\r\nNasus is a shit champion right now. In reality, he is been for a long time but even the most dedicated Nasus players are painfully aware of that. The reason why is this game has simply power creeped Nasus so hard that there actually isn&#039;t a reliable point in the game where he&#039;s strong. Sure post 40-50 minutes you are if you&#039;ve managed to farm in that time because you&#039;ll be banging down turrets with ease and nobody can really stop you. But his team fight is still garbage. His ability to be impactful in an interactive way is almost non-existent and he simply just doesn&#039;t feel good anymore. \r\n\r\nAsk any Nasus player from the early days of the game, even as far as season 3/4 - Nasus felt good late game. He&#039;s largely been a mid game power house due to how easy it is to kill him late game but at least he had a power spike you felt you could rely on if you farmed. But the game paces so fast now and there aren&#039;t any signs of that changing. This has eliminated nasus&#039; mid game spike. You can look on any charts and you&#039;ll find Nasus has a sub 50% winrate pre 25-30 minutes whereas his highest winrate actually came between these times even as early as last season. That simply isn&#039;t the case anymore.\r\n\r\nThen you consider that there are so many champions that do everything he does but much more reliably and earlier. They aren&#039;t gated by farm or a cheesey split push that falls off at 15 minutes (E max Nasus). They scale incredibly safer and harder barring ridiculously long games. And frankly, with nasus&#039; ancient design, they&#039;re just smoother and more accessible in almost all situations where Nasus simply isn&#039;t. There&#039;s too much cc, there&#039;s too much mobility and the strengths that Nasus does present are not unique nor are they strengths he&#039;s even remotely close to being the best at.\r\n\r\nYou could have his ult give him 150 flat resists for it&#039;s entire duration and it wouldn&#039;t matter. It&#039;s so laughbly easy to kite this champion. I understand he&#039;s probably still a pub stomper in bronze/silver and many posters on this board are bronze and silver so your response will likely be of a different nature since your experience with and against Nasus will be much different but even in dogshit elos like gold, plat and low diamond, kiting a Nasus and all but nullifying his existence is a remarkably easy task. \r\n\r\nWhat I can say is this: I do not expect riot to move mountains to make Nasus good. They have a goal and direction for their game but that is a world that isn&#039;t favorable for Nasus and he will continue to slowly be phased out as a champion. I know we throw around the term VGU a lot here and unnecessarily it&#039;s fine often. However, I don&#039;t see a place where you can slightly modify nasus&#039; kit to compete in today&#039;s game where it feels fair to play against. Riot has gone away from high sustain low interactive champions not named Gangplank because it&#039;s an unhealthy general style of play to have. And Nasus does it in such a way that his scaling and simplicity overtakes you very quickly whereas even when miles ahead, it&#039;s very easy to fuck up and die on Gangplank. And this is an example, I&#039;m not casting a slight in Gangplank or any other champion for that matter. It&#039;s more of an illustration of just how bad Nasus is now. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s time. I hate saying that too because even though I&#039;ve thrown around the rework (or by today&#039;s definition VGU) term with Nasus before, I always knew buffs would help him in those times but I was convinced Riot wouldn&#039;t do it. Then Riot would do it or buff him indirectly and he&#039;d level out. But this is just far beyond any negative experience I&#039;ve ever had with Nasus, even in s2 when many of you will remember he was considered a troll pick. I don&#039;t see a future for Nasus in this game as it stands and while there aren&#039;t other kore pressing champions who are far unhealthier than Nasus on the VGU list, I would like to think Nasus is starting to be discussed as a possible candidate for one. I feel he needs it and anyone is free to agree or disagree.\r\n\r\n I want everyone understand that in all probability, I have far more experience on this champion than likely all of you and have well over thousands of games on him since I started at the beginning of s2 and maimed him since then.  I&#039;ve known many of the original Nasus players over the year very well such as Hyfe, NateKiller, etc and still talk to them frequently. With respect, there&#039;s likely nothing you can tell me about him that I&#039;m not already aware of or haven&#039;t thought of. I simply ask that you approach this objectively rather than with the all-too-common mentality that you know more this than the person you&#039;re responding to because of your self bias. To be clear, this is something we are all guilty of at all times. I&#039;m simply asking you to be considerate of it before posting.

In general is Juggernaut Brethren just do his job much more efficiently...\n\nI too have over 1000 games on Nasus. I've mained him since season 2 but didn't start doing ranked seriously until last season. I love the champion and it's why I still play him but even games I do well, look at my most recent game, if my teams are bad I just can not carry no matter how well I do or far I get ahead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RacoonHunter","date":"2017-06-09T11:19:36.852+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think one of the major things that's holding Susan back from riot doing anything to him is the fact that his W is a \"backwards slow\" While other slows do the target initially, this one takes it time and by the time it's full effect has come into being, the target is outside of his Q range (no ult).  \n\nAnother reason that susan's can't carry in my opinion is that unlike other champions that split push to victory, he takes WAY too long now a days, even with the towers being weak as shit.  \nlets look at the \"meta\" top laners {{champion:240}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:92}}  etc. (I know they aren't split pushers but they are his opponents he will more than likely face in the top lane.)  Each of these champions can rush {{item:3077}} and clear waves FASTER than him, more mobility than him, and can do more damage than him. Nasus has to slowly push the lane because he needs time to farm his Q. \n\nHell, {{champion:58}} DUMPSTERS nasus  assuming equal skill because of how the champions have evolved (and the fact that renek's E shreds some armor vs nasus's E which only reduces it by a small ammount and not by a %) with items. \n\nWhat I would like to see is easier stacking (but less damage on his q), his w being toned down and more upfront, his E being more than just an AOE poke for AP nasus, and his ult to be worthwhile again. Renektons does almost the same thing, but does more damage and is more impactful than nasus's.","replies":[{"poster":"Sagaxwiki","date":"2017-06-09T16:36:21.286+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"How can you possibly think that Kled, Fiora, and Riven are not split pushers?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"rework trundle","date":"2017-06-09T01:38:21.816+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm always glad to see other Nasus mains here. \n\nI'd give him this some of the buffs below that could come along with some nerfs to balance it all.\n\n* Passive heals before resists (not every other LS items he could build, only his passive). \n\nIt could be a flat scaling with level + scaling ratio based on number of stacks or ad or hp. This is to make sure his healing doesn't become nonexistent when fighting huge tanks such as Malphite or Shen, but doesn't make a huge difference when fighting squishies.\n\n* R gives him passively 10/20/30% bonus armor pen \n\nThis could be moved to Q increased by number of stacks, but then he would become too feast or famine so having it scale on R level seems like a better idea.\n\n* He gains 40/50/60/70/80 movement speed while in E\n\nI'm not sure about this one though. E's mana cost is already really high for what it provides, but you couldn't make use of the ms AND armor pen often.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Emerald Fang","date":"2017-06-09T03:53:16.156+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"How is plat/low diamond \"dogshit elo\"?
