This will reward a well stacked Nasus that has say 600 stacks in the mid-game with 6% additional tenacity. I also think the amount is low enough that he doesn't get too much tenacity but it is probably high enough to make a bit of a difference in terms of getting perpetually kited..

This feels like a  lose-lose-lose situation.  The trade-off between 1 and 2 is really counter-intuitive b/c Nasus currently works by split-pushing but the q-farming mechanic doesn't want him to push hard when he has the lane to himself.  This trade-off is particularly unforgiving because of his weird powercurve -- he is  a weak early game champion who also falls off hard at around the 28th minute because  of his crap teamfighting.  \n\nMaybe you could change spirit fire so that any minions in spirit fire killed by nasus but not by spirit fire would go to his q stacks.  So when his enemy leaves lane, Nasus could throw down spirit fire, use IBG or titanic hydra to quickly clear the creeps and pressure objectives without losing q-farm.  But This change wouldn't allow Nasus  to farm creeps at range with spirit fire and wouldn't help nasus q-farm under tower early game very much.  \n\nIf you don't make this change  you will need to improve his teamfighting, so he doesn't fall off so hard come 30 minutes.  For example, either [1] give him %armor pen somewhere in his kit so he can damage the enemy frontline in teamfights (currently, in teamfights he can't get to the backline but  his q-stacking is meaningless versus tanks in a teamfight b/c of all the armor and Nasus' inability to itemize effectively for  armor pen); [2] give Nasus some sort of conditional mobility or tenacity, probably which only kicks in late game (this way he can get to the backline in teamfights.  You might tie the mobility to his q-stacking this way you don't end up buffing his early game); [3] give Nasus some innate tanking steroids, such as damage reduction on his ult (so he can more effectively serve as a front-line in teamfights); [4] give Nasus more cc in his kit, so he can function as a sort of warden in teamfights (e.g., grounded debuff in his spirit-fire).  \n\nI really don't know which would be the best course of action.  It would be fun to see each one of these on the PBE to see which one works out but I guess you don't do it that way.  \n\nIn any case, you either  need to  allow him to split-push faster without sacrificing q-stacks or you need to improve his late game teamfighting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KilljoyX","date":"2016-09-14T13:44:35.640+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6KwQYcZG,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-09-13T23:36:54.709+0000)\n>\n> I think it&#x27;s pretty likely we&#x27;ll do some small scope work on him sometime later this year.

Once the mastery's were changed, he received a soft nerf because he couldn't overload the defensive tree with mastery points to make his base stats serviceable in the early game. I had to rearrange my rune pages multiple times with defensive runes in order to find an OK combination for just the early game immediately after the change.\n\nWith spirit fire in tandem with {{item:3025}} he is pretty good at split-pushing. Also at that point ins the game Nasus shouldn't be completely focused on stacking Qs, because he needs to be helping the team close out the games. The games where I have 800+ stacks are typically the games I lose the most frequently because at that point the opposing team knows how to deal with me in a fight.\n\nYou have about 15-20 minutes to just farm with Nasus. After that you have to start making decisions in the game and exert map pressure. You can't simply farm the whole game for an insane stack count, if you do you are not going to win many games in general, but you won't win many games with {{champion:75}}. Whenever I play against a Nasus, I know exactly what I should do. Let Nasus AFK farm and group early with my team to take objectives. That way the opposing team is playing from behind early or most of the game early.\n\nEdit: I can get behind Nasus gaining % mobility or % tenacity based on his stack count. I have been advocating this for months. But I don't think his kit needs much, if any alteration. Maybe wither's range should be increased to make it easier for him to gap close.\n\nIf Nasus is overtuned all we will see is hard Nasus counter picks or ranged champions in the top lane again.\n\nSecond Edit: I think Nasus is a decision-making champion with a simple kit. The better you are at making decisions in the game, the higher you will climb with Nasus. I think Nasus teaches basic farm mechanics, patience, and how players can make difficult choices. I really like that about him and I feel other champions do not condition players with the same skills.\n\nI do think that if his ultimate even gave him a defensive steroid or increased tenacity that would be good as well. His kit is centered around Q, meaning that any changes to his kit should also center around Q or you can change the identity of the champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Great Ozymandius","date":"2016-09-14T20:31:55.417+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have only minor disagreements with what you have said.  But I still think Riot needs to do something with Nasus' power curve, which base stats will not fix.

I agree, tying mobility/tenacity to q-stacks is a good way to  maintain his identity while also allowing him to teamfight late game.  Other options would include: [1] %armor pen on spirit fire as a function of q-stacks, this way his damage versus tanks on the frontline of teamfights is non-negligible; [2] something like a grounded debuff on spirit fire so he can warden for carries in teamfights or  can get to more slippery champions such as ezreal or lucian (this would  not affect nasus in lane or splitpushing very much at all); [3] have wither range increase with q-stacks (they nerfed wither range because of op nasus  ganks back in the day.  Tying wither range to q stacks gets around that balance issue); [4] % damage reduction on ultimate as a function of q-stacks (This would not affect his early laning but would allow him to tank a non-trivial amount of damage in teamfights.  Currently, Full-tank Nasus will die charging the enemy backline in a teamfight b/c he gets kited and isn't able to lifesteal off anyone.  Making him a little harder to kill when his ult is up would make him a more valuable front-line champion).","replies":[{"poster":"Swiftstrike4","date":"2016-09-14T21:57:35.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Great Ozymandius,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6KwQYcZG,comment-id=0003000100000000,timestamp=2016-09-14T20:31:55.417+0000)\n>\n> [1] %armor pen on spirit fire as a function of q-stacks, this way his damage versus tanks on the frontline of teamfights is non-negligible; \n[2] something like a grounded debuff on spirit fire so he can warden for carries in teamfights or  can get to more slippery champions such as ezreal or lucian (this would  not affect nasus in lane or splitpushing very much at all); \n[3] have wither range increase with q-stacks (they nerfed wither range because of op nasus  ganks back in the day.

Ha.\n\nI can get behind flat armor pen as a function of spirit fire increasing base on stack count but I don't know in what capacity. It would have to be really low with a hard cap. Percentage armor penetration on anything seems really strong and can be misused I think. I like how E shreds armor and maybe simply increasing the armor shred would be enough. Imagine if he drops a spirit fire on an ADC with % armor penetration? It shreds the little armor than have the ADC can easily be blown up. \n\nI think point 2 could be too strong. In tandem with wither I think it would make Nasus virtually inescapable and I think that would be highly problematic. Nasus would just be banned a lot by top laners, not because he is strong, but because laners wouldn't want to deal with him. Similar to {{champion:122}} or {{champion:420}} who see a lot of bans but are not over powered champions.\n\n3 I can get behind wither range increased based on a q stack count. But there would need to be a hard cap to it. I think wither's range should simply be increased flat by 25- 100 in general.\n\nI think the 4th suggestion might be the best one. But there is something one needs to consider which is \"what if Nasus builds full damage?\" While this may not happen early on, if Nasus gains any type of defensive buff while using his ultimate, players may recognize they don't need to build full tank. This is currently the situation we have with {{champion:240}} who has a massive health pool and can build straight assassin if he wants due to it. I think a defensive steroid would be good overall, but it can't be too high. \n\nI really think increased mobility/tenacity solves almost all of Nasus' issues without making him too strong. Any type of significant kit revision is unnecessary with most of the people's suggesting such things (in this thread) do not even playing Nasus a lot. I play Nasus A LOT. I logged in enough games to get over a  1.3 million mastery score with him and I can say when you play him you really can recognize little things that are problematic with him. \n\nWhen I feel completely helpless with a lot of stacks in the late game in the post 35 minute mark, that is a problem. When I have to sit and patiently wait for the opponent to make a mistake, by overextending when I have 600-700 stacks, that's a problem. When I play into a typical comp of {{champion:32}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:201}} (which is not an uncommon comp) and I can't even GET NEAR THEM without being chain CC'd or slowed, that's a problem. \n\nI guess I am erring on the side of caution with overtuning him because I think really minor changes could make him a bit too strong and a ban candidate. My point is at this time last year Nasus was at about 50% win rate (pretty high for most champions). \n\nI think the question we should be asking is \"why did his win rate fall?\" rather than \"how can his kit change to bring his win rate up?\"\n\nI think his win rate largely fell because of his ability to be kited is higher now than in the past with mobility on items seeing minor nerfs, mastery changes, several nerfs to items that he built, and the increase in slow items such as {{item:3022}} {{item:3025}} and {{item:3116}}.\n\nAnd when you think \"well he should have a really poor win rate if that's the case\" the reality is he doesn't. It is on the lower end, but by no means is it low. Which is why I think just solving the mobility/gap close issue he has, but still making him kitable (like all other juggs) will alleviate a lot of his problems, even in higher elo.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"HateDaddy","date":"2016-09-13T22:52:06.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Swiftstrike4,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6KwQYcZG,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-09-13T22:42:13.954+0000)\n>\n> I think Nasus just needs modest base stat adjustments.

Could you elaborate on a few of those champions and explain how they indicate another champion may be off balance?

I&#x27;ve found that during metas where assassins become popular, my winrates with Swain and Trundle increase as they are particularly good at both denying and shutting them down, which is why I play them to begin with.\n\nMost of the champions in that list have relatively simple kits. They are all low skill-cap aside from {{champion:412}}, meaning that most players can pick them up and be relatively proficient with them pretty quickly. They are the \"generic\" or \"middle ground\" or \"model\" champion for their role. Mechanically, they are simple and have lower amount of skill shots than perhaps the average champion and very simple skills that don't involve an additional passive for the skill to consider. A {{champion:23}} that is silver vs. one that is Gold is not going to have much of a mechanical advantage. Even if the gold player understandz the game better, makes better decisions, can trade better, and lane better, the gold player is winning because he is better at placing a well-timed skill shot in a precise location.\n\nThis also means that most players across all elos should be able to perform adequately with these champions without too much practice due to their simplicity. {{champion:1}} mains in bronze will probably have a higher win rate overall than say a bronze {{champion:1}} main because annie has a kit that leaves less room for mechanical error. This doesn't mean Annie's will have above a 50% win rate all the time, but it should be higher than the norm due to the champions simplicity and most players because able to effectively use her regardless of how frequently they play the champion. Most champions in league do not float in the 50% win rate, infact it usually is around 1/3 to 1/4 are 50% or higher. Many of the champions that consistently have higher win rates typically the simple ones with high utility see {{champion:32}}. \n\nAll these champions I think have a clear identity for specific roles for the most part. By this I mean an itemization changes are not going to drastically alter how they play, how often they are selected, what role they play, and their overall strength. They have relatively flexible build paths, moderate damage, and high utility.\n\nA current example is the recent buff to Rylais which pushed champions such as {{champion:63}} {{champion:34}} and {{champion:161}} into high win rates, but champions such as {{champion:1}} {{champion:99}} and {{champion:25}} are relatively unaffected by it being buff due to their kits and their win rates have remained about the same while first three have gone up. \n\nI think {{champion:75}} falls into the category of a generic top lane tank that can also do damage. Rarely do items significantly effect his strength compared to other top laners. The recent buffs to {{item:3078}} did help him, but it was relatively lower than how much it helped other champions whose play and win rate were more significantly impacted {{champion:39}} and {{champion:120}} being two notable examples. And more recently the tank {{champion:157}} and {{champion:245}} builds.\n\nThere are probably other champions that I think fall into this category, but it just seems for the most part almost all these champions have always been \"good\" or \"adequate\" regardless of the Elo. They are all good at what they were designed to do and are played frequently for there simplicity and utility. They are rarely overpowered but are rarely too weak. \n\nI think in the case of {{champion:75}} his falling win rate suggests something is off with top lane itemization or the general state of the top lane.\n\nThose are my thoughts though and I think right now currently the ADC and Support Tanks are very even in terms of their game health which is why I didn't list quite as many. I think all of them are pretty well-tuned and not dramatically effected by itemization changes or their role changing. {{champion:15}} is pretty balanced has almost always been viable a long with {{champion:81}} in the bot lane. Recent outliers are {{champion:96}} and {{champion:29}} who have both moved to the jungle due to bloodrazer.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"HateDaddy","date":"2016-09-13T22:06:30.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Medlar plis","replies":[{"poster":"Alutrosity","date":"2016-09-13T23:24:44.134+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nasus is like the tanky equivalent of Kog'Maw in regards to needing to have a comp built around him.
