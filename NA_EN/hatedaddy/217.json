Let&#039;s not hide from the facts folks, the majority of the people on these boards are gold elo or below. And because of this on a board dedicated to the games balance, players elos often get brought up. And in response, many low elo players say &quot;well I&#039;m low elo but I have high elo game knowledge!&quot; This is where things get pretty hot and I ask you read this before dismiss it angirly \r\n\r\nQuite simply put: no you don&#039;t. I consider the high elo threshold to be right at plat 1 and I would consider the knowledge of a diamond 1 player to be better (but it&#039;s likely the plat 1 players understands the game at a high level well enough to have a sensible discussion with much higher elo players). You might point out I&#039;m plat 1 and this is why I feel that way. No, I was diamond season 4 and I&#039;ve always felt this way - I simply haven&#039;t grinded many games yet. I just wanted to get that out of the way because I know someone would likely bring it up.\r\n\r\nBack on topic: I&#039;m going to tell the lower elo folks here something that might surprise you. You can have shit mechanics and still get decently high elo. Why? Because of game knowledge. Game knowledge alone can easily get you mid diamond, after that point, your mechanics do start becoming more and more important. \r\n\r\nWhen I hear a lower elo player say they have the high elo game knowledge, it&#039;s actually something concerns me. Because, in reality, if the lower elo player did, he wouldn&#039;t be low elo. You might watch streams of high elos, you might read blogs of high elos and pick up some things but that doesn&#039;t give you their game knowledge. The only way to truly get a real perspective of it is to play in it yourself. And the counter argument to this is often &quot;well being high elo doesn&#039;t mean you have high elo game knowledge.&quot; This simply isn&#039;t true. Sure, there might be other players with their elo with much better knowledge but in reality, their knowledge is good enough to be in high elo, which will be above and beyond that of a lower elo players. In many cases, when this argument is brought up, it&#039;s because a high elo player is shit at explaining, arguing and discussing knowledge. There&#039;s no way their knowledge is shit though.\r\n\r\nI gotta admit, this came off as extremely elitist and the truth is, it probably is. But the reason it&#039;s so concerning is if, as a low elo, you have the mindset that you have high elo game knowledge, you&#039;ll have this idea that it&#039;s only a matter of improving mechanics as you think your knowledge is sufficient when it isnt. This will lead to a lot of bad habits and the truth is, if you&#039;re not focusing on the mental aspect of the game and gaining more knowledge, you&#039;re likely not improving much. Your mechanics aren&#039;t going to improve much playing against bronze and silvers because they won&#039;t be challenged after a certain point. This is the issue most &quot;elo hell&quot; believers have, they&#039;re convinced they know about the game when they don&#039;t, they chirp off buzzwords they hear on streams and LCS videos and think it doesn&#039;t need to get better when in reality, it&#039;s what&#039;s holding them back. \r\n\r\nHow is this relevant to GB? Because it makes discussing balance with the people here a pain in the ass. I will *never* dismiss any argument based on elo unless the argument is based on soley the level of play in a comparison of high elo vs low elo. But at a certain point, you have to understand that higher elo players are going to just know more about the game than you and as you want them to not be so dismissive of you because of your elo, you need to be less dismissive of them. That&#039;s not to say that high elos can&#039;t work on not being elitist ass holes because believe me, a lot of them can. But I will take their word over that of a lower elo players any day. And while that may be frustrating to hear, it&#039;s the truth. So when discussing balance, understand I will never be dismissive of you because of your elo. If your argument is well thought out, I will happily discuss it and even hopefully one of two scenarios occur: I was misinformed and learned something or I was able to teach somethig. Both are awesome.  If you&#039;re bringing up anecdotal evidence however, I will point it out because high elo &gt; low elo.\r\n\r\nSo tl;dr, elo does matter in game knowledge and all elo players need to realize this too. And if you ever have the mindset that your game knowledge can&#039;t improve (aka you can&#039;t be wrong), you&#039;ll never get better and discussing anything balance wise with you is a waste.","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-04-21T03:56:38.716+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":12,"body":"I'm not going to bother to read the low elo berating in this thread.

You didn't see all those posts from low elo players saying they have good knowledge of the game? That they're enough to challenge a diamond player's knowledge? You're not even going to bother reading OP's arguments?\n\nIt's so easy for low elo players to claim that they understand, but you guys really don't. Sometimes for the very low ranked, your very foundations and basic premises of the game are so off that you can't comprehend what we're saying. This isn't to say that it's always the case, but sometimes it really is.\n\nYou claim that just because you're poor at the game doesn't mean that your sense of logic is flawed, and that low ranked people are capable of realizing when someone is better than them at the game, and also that they're capable of understanding how things happen and how games should play out even if that doesn't happen in their own games. What you're thinking of is the most basic of understandings, but what you fail to understand is the more complex ideas behind it. League isn't the static game you make it out to be, you can never simply \"understand how things happen and how games should play out\". It doesn't happen in your games, you have no experience with it. You may have the knowledge to overcome the initial hurdle, but then you're presented with even more branching decisions with obscure answers, and so on and so forth. You guys never run into these situations, so how in the world can you be proficient at it?\n\nPerhaps there is a phrasing issue. Sure, you guys can understand the basic processes of the game. But can you claim to understand the complex and advanced processes of the game, and as well as a diamond player at that?","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-04-21T04:36:05.421+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"That's a logically sound argument, but the only way you're going to make this argument convincing to me is through examples.

It's very easy to see that I probably shouldn't have done something in hindsight (which shows that I understand them).\n\nYes, I do realize the game mode for every one of them.\n\n1. Sustain from revolver is rather lackluster on most champions, Lux included. You're better off going frontloaded AP damage.\n2. ? Not sure what auras has to do with void staff. Void staff is wasted buy because only one person on their team has MR.\n3. Okay, I can overlook this if you yolo-bought brutalizer. If it wasn't an end of the game yolo-buy, I would call you out on it for going over the CDR limit and availability of better alternatives.\n4. Yes. The BT WAS a bad choice, however you decided to go with it anyways. However, your philosophy is wrong. You screwed yourself over by committing to the BT, your best choice was to just buy a scepter and finish your shiv/PD. By committing to finishing a 3500g purchase, you really sealed your own fate that game. BT would in no way help you survive, PD and Shiv would do that much better for much lower cost. So, this in fact DID throw off your entire build, build and buy timing is very important.\n5. Exactly, it's an ARAM. Constant brawling, plus a need for sustenance in HP and mana. RoA is the superior buy here because while it does have a charging time, it is significantly steadier than Seraph's. The increased HP helps you fight sustained fights vs their comp, Seraph's does not. You cannot burst them down, they will DPS you down. Not to mention the passive from catalyst.\n6. You don't finish liandry's on Katarina. Haunting guise is all you need, nothing past that. Liandry's does nothing for Kat, who relies on upfront damage and high AP ratios, and most importantly deleting the squishies. You win teamfights not through fighting the tanks, but by deleting the squishies for resets so you can whittle down the tanks along with the rest of your team. You could have finished Void staff with the gold you spent completing liandry's. The burn does nothing for you.\n\nAnd once again, yes I did realize they are ARAM. It's all accounted for. Take a look at what I'm saying, and think again as to whether I'm really proving your point or my own. You claim that you easily understand those champions, items, and why some were problematic, but from what I see, you don't. You say you understand because hindsight, but judging from your explanation, you don't understand **why**.","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-04-21T06:39:25.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"I misread when you pointed out void staff, I thought you said abyssal.

It's quite sad that you would try to pull that.\n\nI gave you very specific reasoning as to why you didn't understand it. Sure, you agreed that BT was a bad buy on the surface, but you got the reasoning wrong. This goes back to my point that while you may understand the basic concepts, you don't understand the more complex nuances.\n\nI gave you very specific reasoning for everything, well-backed, and didn't mention elo anywhere. How can you possibly accuse me of exercising my authority as higher elo?\n\nSorry to say this, but I tried giving you a chance. I left elo out of the rational discussions, but as usual, the bronze player caves in and pulls the \"whatever mr. diamond. u look down on us all\" when I rationally and non-authoritatively rebut your discussion points, and you have nothing left to say. This exemplifies how the majority of discussions go between bronze and diamond arguments.\n\nIt's funny because you and many other bronze players like yourself complain about how Diamonds just talk down on Bronze players and dismiss them as _\"bronze know-it-all condescending fool not worth my time\"_ without explaining why, just citing their ranks as proof and how you're sick of it when you try to offer a reasonable argument and they don't listen, yet you are doing exactly that right now. Berating me and dismissing me as a _\"diamond know-it-all condescending fool not worth my time\"_ while refusing to listen when I reasonably and rationally explain things to you. It's also funny how you wanted me to give examples to convince you, and as soon as I do just that you pull that shit.\n\nFact of the matter is, you are not on par with me knowledge-wise. I would say that to you regardless of your rank just based on your reasoning. If you disagree, then I must say that's a bit delusional. As harsh as it sounds, **_YOU ARE STUCK IN BRONZE 5_**. There has to be SOMETHING I'm doing right/better than you. You wouldn't be able to win at gold, plat, or diamond even with my mechanics. Similarly, if you sat behind me and coached me on item builds and strategies while I played and exercised the best of my mechanics, I would not be able to win at a plat/diamond level.","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-04-21T07:49:44.978+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"I'm not criticizing you for looking down on me because it's a stereotype.

You know damn well I specifically said that although you understood that BT was a wrong purchase, you didn't understand why. I even specifically stated why BT was the wrong purchase. I never said anything even remotely close to \"you made a mistake so you can't talk to us\". You need to understand this.\n\n**_I. Gave. You. Rational. Explanations. Stop. Trying. To. Misrepresent. My. Arguments._**\n\nAlso, you can't just say \"yeah? well talk about something I actually understand so I can rebut it and arrive to the false conclusion that i am knowledgeable\". Your lack of knowledge in champions and items (which isn't cut and dry, by the way) is a lack of knowledge, no two ways about it. It's just as important as general strategy and team comps. You can't just say \"nah that doesn't count\".\n\nThat said, team comps and general strategy are so fluid and vary so much depending on each individual situation and elo (yes, strategies differ depending on elo) that it's nearly impossible to have to discussion on that over the boards. It's something neither you can prove, nor I can disprove over the forums.

Of course it exists, and of course foresight is a large part of knowledge. Even a fool can come to the conclusion that something isn't working out if it clearly fails.

If you cannot understand and draw conclusions from your understanding and knowledge given the necessary information, then you don't understand it. What you're doing is drawing conclusions from results. If you were not given results, you would never be able to draw correct conclusions. Am I wrong? That's your methodology.\n\nNow apply this to theory crafting. You throw out a completely bizarre theory which is based on understanding and, get this, FORESIGHT. Let's say Riot implements your idea despite your completely lack of foresight as you yourself admit. The idea turns out to be completely HORRIBLE because you have not experienced its results, you don't know how it reacts in a live environment. You don't have the foresight to judge whether it's balanced or not.

It doesn't matter what your reasoning is, or what your potential is. All that matters is that by not trying, you have not realized your potential. I was the same way as you before, I only cared about gold rewards in S3. I kept playing at a bare minimum, only to maintain gold (I decayed 4 times for inactivity, I climb back, and decay again). In season 4, I finally decided to climb, and I crushed my way to diamond within a short amount of time and # of games played, at a 65% win rate which even includes my low win rate from when I was messing around in duo at the beginning of the season.\n\nEven though I crushed my way to diamond and proved myself, I improved along the way. Sure, at gold 5 I had the potential to be diamond, but in no way was I the same skill level or at the same level of knowledge when I was in G5 and when I was in D5.

Despite its length, it doesn't ramble and it's very straight to the point with sound reasoning. I'm going to be as thorough in my response as I possibly can be and if I miss something, please point it out.\n\nA good chunk of my post is very broad in nature. Not because I want to intentionally dis-include anything but because the nature of my belief behind this has an extreme depth to it that takes quite a bit of time and effort to explore - to be quite honest with you, I doubt most people are interested in reading that. But because you brought it up, I'll explain.\n\nWhen I say game knowledge, this excludes very basic concepts of the game that any average level 30 player should have. Game knowledge isn't exactly a stat that can be measured, the higher the elo, the higher level the play is. The higher the level the play, the more complex the game becomes at a very minute level. While a lot of basics are still shared between all elos, as I've noted, it gets a bit more complex.\n\nSo when I make this statement, I make it on the backbone that there's no way a silver player can understand how to play in a diamond game. The diamond game will be much more punishing of mistakes, even the smallest positional mistakes that are often made and left unpunished in low elo. The game and the decision making are played at a much faster level. Snowballing is much harder because people know how to punish mistakes harder. While some of this is true in all elos but to a lesser and lower quality of play, as its higher, and I hate to wear this word out, it's more complex and in depth. Simply put: there's no way a lower elo player could ever understand this. The only way they do is by ranking up and experiencing it.\n\nI'll give you an example I like using to describe this. Imagine you're watching a front page game of ranked high elo. You see a Hecarim and Darius fighting it out. Darius is running flash/ignite, Hecarim is running ignite/TP. You watch as the Darius has Hecarim under tower and below half health but Darius is barely above half himself. Darius hits six with just a few of his minions left dying under tower. Many low elo players would probably wonder why Darius isn't walking up to the escapeless Hecarim and dropping a Q/AA/R/Ignite to secure what seems like an easy kill. Instead, the Darius backs. How many people will understand why he backed instead of securing what seems like a sure kill?\n\nBecause a few things: the minion wave is going to reset in the middle of the wave after those minions die, or damn close to Hecs tower. Darius has it warded but doesn't see the jungler, he can only assume he's nearby expecting the dive. Darius would most assuredly die as well as he would draw aggro and Hecarim would likely ult him under tower. Darius has flash/ignite, not TP. So if Darius secures the kill and you'd think \"snowball champion so it's a win for him,\" it's not. Hecarim is just going to TP back in, freeze the wave as Darius is going to be denied minions since his minions will be right under Hecs tower. They still traded 1 for 1 so Hec got a good chunk of gold and because of the freeze, Hec is going to be last hitting more and will also gain an EXP advantage to boot. Not to mention, Darius typically doesn't want to blow flash unless it's for a kill that doesn't involve his own death because of how easy he is to gank, he basically wants to have flash for straight forward sure fired kills or an escape.\n\n\nIn this situation, I can promise you lower elos wouldn't consider half of this and go for the dive. This is an example of small details you must always pay attention to at all times of the game. And not only must you pay attention, you must understand what's going to happen next and predict it accurately. At lower levels, this in depth knowledge and thinking just doesn't happen. And that's why I say there's no way they have the same knowledge. They may be knowledgable of the game, but understanding so many small things that a high elo player does likely just doesn't happen because they've never had to think this way and very few players, if any at all, can put a lot of this shit into words.\n\nWhat impact does this have on balance knowledge?  A pretty big one. Because some champions, as a result of less knowledge and in depth thinking, can take complete advantage of this due to the natures of their kits. So as a result, from the above example, that Darius in silver would likely dive the Hecarim and die and lose ultimately in the end because that kill was actually a bad trade for him. The first thing he'd do is QQ \"omg Hecarim so op I dove him killed him solo but he just farmed and outscaled me.\"\nHecarim might actually be op, but because of his inability to rationalize this as a mistake and blaming the champions, he actually doesn't improve. And if he were to instead focus on what he did wrong, what caused the bad trade on something that seemingly seemed good, he just got better. And over the course of time, he's going to learn more and more about the game in small intricacies because of that. So eventually, he just won't be low elo anymore. Is that to say every low elo isn't in the process of that learning experience right now? Absolutely not, but a deep understanding is still rather lacking if they're still in low elo. That's just a matter of time for them, not a matter of if.\n\nSo when I think elo, I don't actually think rank as skill. I see it as a measurement of the players ability to approve, adapt, learn and climb. Though it is skill involved, I see that skill becomes a secondary byproduct of the climb and knowledge, experience is what's likely gained first and most probably noticed by the player right away, even if subconsciously. Combine this with the above written paragraphs, and sorry, there's just no way a low elo player has the same knowledge. Not because they're stupid, not because they're incapable but because its just a matter of not experiencing the same things that higher level of play demands. \n\nNow, regarding mechanics. Mechanics are absolutely important. But I truly believe mechanics require a lower threshold of skill to raise in elo than knowledge does - that's not to say there's extremely gifted but less than average knowledgable mechanical Players in high el because there are. But it's a rarity. So much of this game is decide on the decisions you make from all points of the game, as long you have the bare minimum set of mechanics required to compete at your elo, you can win - it might take longer to grind up than others but you should win. As I stated, after a certain point, I don't think you can get away with poor game knowledge doing this. And as I said in my OP, I do believe there is a certain threshold in very high elo where you have to have some damn good mechanics if you want to continue to rise.  \n\nBut all this said, I will absolutely never dismiss the statements of a lower elo player just because they're lower elo. The only time I would is if they compare their games to mine and assume we see the same things - I spent quite a bit of time explaining why they don't so I believe that's clear why id mention elo at that point. And there are times, probably more common than some low elo players would like to admit, where I can read their statements and just dismiss it as low elo ranting because that shit doesn't fly in high elo. An example would be the spammed usuage of \"focusing the tank.\" Focusing the tank is bad when your entire team blows it's load on an ulted Alistar after his combo is down or a Leona with W active while her combo is down. Focusing a ghosted Nasus, while built tanky, isn't \"focusing the tank.\" It's focusing the biggest fucking threat to your backline and likely the enemy teams tankiesst member and largest source of damage aside from the ADC. Yes he's tanky but he's immobile and can't just walk past front lines. Applying minimal CC on him and kiting him easily kills him, and kiting him as a team more importantly since the burden is on him as an immobile melee champion to get to your back line, is not focusing the tank. Anyone who says \"yeah ok focus nasus, just focus the tank. Good job on losing the fight because you focused the tank.\" When I see that, I just dismiss it - any high elo player would know exactly what i just explained to be true because in high elo, Nasus isn't really a problem in teamfights - he's easily dealt with. And this is just one of many examples I can name as something I'd see from low elo ranting and banter that I'm simply going to ignore and dismiss.\n\nBut again, *i will never dismiss a players statements just because of their elo alone.* if it has sound reasoning, logic, respectable knowledge behind it then I have something worth discussing. When it's just angry downvote one line spammers mad because the truth hurts, there's not much I can do. \n\nSo if you get upset about this but you are trying to learn the game and improve your knowledge, know that the low elo banter and low elo mindset doesn't apply to you - because over a course of time you will just get better. And your knowledge will improve and expand as a result. Just know that it never ends, even at the highest of elos, knowledge and the expansion of it is ever growing. Even at the pro level this is true because the game is ever changing. So keep grinding and you'll get there. \n\nAs for your rank, frankly it's hard to say. Unranked players can be an enigma. In some cases, they can be pretty damn good but in reality, there's no credentials backing their statements if it comes down to anecdotal evidence. But that's about it. Again, if you have solid reasoning and a presentable argument, that's something that can be discussed and elo or lack thereof should only apply to a minimal level.\n\nI hope this covers your questions. I haven't had to think like this or lay out my thoughts like this in a long time and it's really refreshing to do so, so thank you for that. Again, if I missed something or it's unclear, ask away and I'll address it or clarify.","replies":[{"poster":"Apollocliptic","date":"2015-04-21T12:14:26.086+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to say, I don't know what low and high elo is specifically. I was under the assumption Bronze - silver is low, plat and diamond are high, gold is mid. (correct me if I'm wrong) the reason I am not sure, is because most people are talking about a bronze and a diamond, and not the inbetween. \nbut as a \"low elo silver\" I do think like your example. Getting the kill will often lead to a disadvantage (similar to some invade scenarios leading to a first blood, but 2 champs have a late start and struggle in lane over one who has edge), I understand the process and apply the deeper thought into my decisions exactly as you say, but it'll be a long time before I reach \"high elo\" so I can't agree with your point. Being low Elo doesn't mean you \"CANT\" understand, you are unlikely to, but it's not impossible, and many aspects cross over into other games or scenarios you might be better at, something else is keeping you low. One of my most frequent mistake (not only, just most frequent) is when I know an ally is making a bad call, and that moment when you have to decide whether you should help them or not. Sometimes helping them might save them (even if they don't get kill/objective) other times you both end up dead.

A good call in Plat might not work in bronze because your allies don't capitalise on it, therefore you need to adapt regardless of elo)\n\nSo yeah, being low elo, I don't think your \"reason\" is accurate, I have flaws, but I think that they are elsewhere","replies":[{"poster":"Onegarion","date":"2015-04-23T02:35:11.051+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To me high/low elo is all relative on the people in question. Obviously Diamond > Gold/Silver/Bronze. I don't think there is going to every be any argument here, but the higher you go the more defined each league and division is in terms of skill/knowledge. In lower elos I really don't see much of a difference between a Bronze 1 and  Silver 4, but there is a pretty big difference between a Diamond 1 and a Diamond 5. \n\nFor the most part I say people within 3 divisions of each other are of equal knowledge/skill unless otherwise proven. So like before a B1 is just as good as a S4. A Gold 2 = Plat 5. After Plat 3 though it starts to get a bit more rocky because the higher you go the better you have to be than the average players, but it tends to come down to more of a techincal/mechanical standpoint and not so much knowledge.

As I said, I wasn't trying to prove either of us as objectively Right or Wrong - just expanding the conversation. And once you shed a little deeper light on your perspective I actually found myself agreeing more with you.\n\nYou were drawing broad arguments - I was applying it to more specific examples. So that is where the few discrepancies between them would lie, I think. I agree that any lower elo player *who is actively trying to raise their rank, and failing to do so* could be said, pretty confidently, to lack that high elo knowledge they need to succeed. I was simply pointing out the cases where the low elo player isn't doing that.\n\nBecause you're right; there are all kinds of things that go unpunished - or even un*noticed* - in lower tiers of play, like orbwalking. And there are entire meta strategies like certain lane swaps that won't appear in silver/gold normal games. So I agree that those aspects that you haven't experienced, you won't understand. There is a ton in this game I still don't understand. I was watching SK/H2K games last night with a friend of mine and there were certain kinds of builds and lane tactics that I was watching and just thinking, \"I don't even know what's happening here\"\n\nIn the end I think we're totally on the same page on the most important part:\n\n> i will never dismiss a players statements just because of their elo alone\n\nAnd that goes for high and low elos alike.\n\nOverall this was a wonderful conversation, and I thank you for your time and consideration.

You are also not nearly as mechanically gated as a short person would be physically gated.\n\nAlso, the \"I'm plat, I know more than bronze players\" in itself has no valid argument behind it. If ever you see this as a standalone explanation with said person not making any previous attempts to explain it, then sure you can question its validity. But boy, is it ever true 99% of the time. We can go into technicalities, but the logos here can be argued by the fact that he is plat. He is in the top 7% of players, and the bronze is at the bottom 25%.

In reality, you don't really need good mechanics until plat-low diamond. Up until there, the majority of it is knowledge and game sense.\n\nThere are some players that have reached diamond without arms. Some players reached gold/plat without LIMBS, he plays with his mouth and head.\n\nThere are also some players that are in challenger playing on a 15FPS laptop at lowest resolution and settings, using the touchpad.\n\nDo you think either of them climbed that high based on mechanics? Nope, it's game knowledge.

Charge up time + gold better used on other items greatly reduce the value of a second RoA. You will never see double RoA in higher-ranked games.\n\nTri-force Firoa is not good cost-efficiency wise. Fiora scales much harder off of AD ratios, and triforce just doesn't give that to Fiora. Sure you gain a Sheen active, but that quickly becomes rather useless in comparison to flat AD. Also, it costs 3703 gold. You could almost buy a god damn IE for that price, or LW + Brutalizer and finish that into a youmuu's later on. Or hexdrinker versus that team.\n\nThe gnar thing, okay. That's understandable.\n\nThe sightstone on Anivia, just upgrade your trinket and buy standalone wards.
