For starters, I&#039;m not too crazy about that because tenacity should be something that requires you to go deep into the defensive tree and any bruiser that would run 9/21 doesn&#039;t like this either since they actually are losing out on 5% (which isn&#039;t really huge but it&#039;s still there). Either way, this basically means tenacity is accessible to everyone - I&#039;m really not sure how I feel about that and regardless, it speaks to a much bigger problem regarding it.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, tenacity sucks. No amount of tenacity you can get (unless you&#039;re irelia) can help you. It used to be that having a knock up in your game was rare - now literally every champion has one tied in with mobility, making the potential of outplaying the knock up even harder - and as far as I know, knock ups arent affected by tenacity. There&#039;s also more displacements, which again, tenacity does nothing for. And even further to that point, there&#039;s a huge abundance of spammable slows in this game THAT HAVE SCALING. Basically, anything that&#039;s melee and immobile or short ranged and not named Ryze of Vlad and immobile, has almost no way of outplaying this or dealing with it.\r\n\r\nSo while basically saying everyone has access to 10% tenacity, it doesn&#039;t change the fact that tenacity still sucks. I rarely itemize for Mercs anymore unless the enemy team is high in magic damage. CC and slows are too spammable and Ninja Tabis 10% reduced damage from AAs is just too good to pass up against carries. \r\n\r\nThe other issue is you can&#039;t just flat out buff tenacity either - else wise you break it because it&#039;s a stat that&#039;s just there. You&#039;d be making champions immune or close to being immune to crowd control. And while stronger tenacity would help less mobile melees and shorter range immobiles, it also breaks the shit out of more mobile champions. Basically high mobility or long range is the only way to deal with the absurd amounts of CC in this game at the moment.  \r\n\r\nI also realize the solution isn&#039;t something that can just be addressed during a regular season, this is probably a preseason long project and what you have in place now is just a band aid fix for a much larger problem. Immobility should be a weakness, for many champions it&#039;s a fantastic designed weakness. But it shouldn&#039;t be a death sentence, which is what it has become unless you can get absurdly fed and far ahead. Otherwise after a certain point, you&#039;re just going to be cc&#039;d for every and basically contribute nothing. \r\n\r\nThere need to be better ways of dealing with this. For starters, you could make ghost a more attractive  summoner spell by giving it slow resistance or something along those lines. There&#039;s a lot of things you could do and I don&#039;t pretend to have all the answers, I just want to know if Riot is aware of this problem and has any plans on addressing it at some point.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2015-06-15T20:33:27.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What if tenacity was an RNG effect that either bypass or half the effectiveness of certain forms of CC if you pass the check?

Spell shields come in the form of abilities and banshees veil. As we've both stated, tenacity literally does dick all to help against slows given how powerful they are at shutting down any form of movement speed based steroids (or movement speed in general). Buffing ghost would help deal with that somewhat but it doesn't change the fact that spammable knock ups and displacements exist.\n\nOne idea I've toyed around with in my head is making banshees spell shield an active rather than just being there waiting to be broken. You could have two auras around them - an aura that signals the banshees active is off cooldown, something probably like a very bright red color. Then you'd have the spell shield aura around them once it's active. \n\nThere's a big problem with that: this is a massive buff to an already powerful item. Banshees is good on different champions for different reasons. Banshees is powerful on carries because it makes them incredibly hard to burst and dive right off the bat: typically you'll be trying to spend time to pop the shield before you hard engage. The power this gives carries to use it on a spell of choice rather than some random slow or something hitting them from distance is so absurd, it's probably not worth exploring. Front liners generally get it for the MR and HP of something like Spirit Visage isn't as good on them because of lacking innate sustain/high Regen, so the spell shield doesn't mean a bunch to them since it's generally easy to pop. So this feels more problematic than it does anything else.\n\nLike I said, this is something they would need to spend probably an entire preseason worth of work to handle and that's IF they even consider this to be a problem. \n\nAlso, Maw is actually really freaking good. If you're an AD bruiser against a heavy AP comp, Maw + Banshees shuts down any chance of you getting bursted by magic damage.\n\nEdit: I forgot cleanse and QSS but neither of these help with knock-ups/displacements. And neither of these are typically good shorter ranged or melee immobile champions (depending on the class, that's not entirely true). But either way, cleanse is barely taken and it doesn't help that heal is basically better than it is for bot lane and that Mikaels/QSS can make up for not having it if cleansing something (think like Nasus' wither or a suppression from Warwick/Skarner/Malz - that's QSS only, you can't cleanse suppression a with Mikeals).","replies":[]}]}]}
