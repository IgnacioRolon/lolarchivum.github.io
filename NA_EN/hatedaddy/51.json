I&rsquo;ll say this: it is true that most of the posts on these boards are often critical, negative, and misguided frustration (putting it nicely). While that isn&rsquo;t necessarily a welcoming reception, it is essential to take these posts in stride to at least make the general public feel like you&rsquo;re accountable. The longer you go without addressing this, the worst it gets because players slowly develop the idea that you don&rsquo;t care about their frustrations and that you and your employees only search for praise. \n\nIf I&rsquo;m being honest, yeah it does seem that Riot only ever responds to posts praising them. I also see the value in ignoring most low quality posts because picking your battles is important, too. Of course, you can never openly say this either, which only further contributes to player disdain. And I&rsquo;m sure if I looked at red posts enough, I&rsquo;d find responses to critical threads but you only need to look at one page of the red tracker to see the overwhelming pattern of positive post responses. \n\nYou guys don&rsquo;t even bother discussing gameplay openly anymore either. It&rsquo;s all after-the-fact discussions (copy/pastes from reddit or closed discussion boards). I want to be as fair as I can be and I am absolutely positive I&rsquo;m biased here too, but perception is a powerful thing. And when people perceive that you don&rsquo;t care and only seek praise, that wears thin. This is especially true when older Rioters used to stand on the front lines and take on hard questions directly with players (Morello was great for this) and not leave some 5 minute video, albeit a well-done video. \n\nThis is what I notice. Maybe I&rsquo;m reaching. I could definitely be reaching. But it is one of the biggest differences I notice between boards now and even boards of 3-4 years ago, or pre-boards on the old forums where Riot constantly took on these “hard threads.”","replies":[]}
