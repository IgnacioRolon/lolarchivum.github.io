That Riven can possibly outplay the Garen doesn't suddenly mean Garen doesn't hard counter Riven. Also, even if she does... so what? She will still take damage from their trades, and unlike Garen has no sustain.\n\nRiven is also squishy (squishier than Fiora in fact), and unlike Fiora generally can't afford to build any defense. Bruiser Fiora is viable and perfectly capable of dueling Riven. Fiora's W turns most of Riven's damage early on back on her, letting her win duels and trades easily, and late game Fiora is far stronger. Oh, and Fiora has sustain.\n\nFirst of all, yes he can, just not levels 1-3 (maybe not four or five either, less sure on that). Once he reaches six he can easily duel Riven, and btw who gives a shit? The game isn't all about dueling. Singed can't duel Fiora early on either, yet he's one of her stronger counters. A Renekton who knows the match up will win every trade with Riven and sustain any damage he takes back, and will probably kill her come level six.\n\nThey might be squishy, but they, especially Quinn, beat up on Riven. A competent Teemo or Quinn will kite Riven through their minion wave (being ranged as benefits), let Riven push, and poke her down.\n\nMalphite is also much better in team fights than she is due to his tankiness and CC. Also, stop pretending that you have to counter a champion in every way post-laning phase. Malphite can't peel, but unless your team comp sucks you should have someone who is perfectly capable of peeling Riven (like Alistar for example). If your team comp sucks so much that you can't peel Riven, that isn't a problem with Riven. It's a problem with your shitty team. \n\nYet he also beats Riven in most games. A good Singed won't die to Riven in lane, can proxy farm to make Riven really feel the pain of being squishy with shitty sustain, and gets too durable for Riven to 1v1. Since Riven pushes like a badass it is also a fairly simple matter to cheese her into your turret with Fling.\n\nRiven isn't the unstoppable boogieman you think she is. She's strong, but perfectly manageable.","replies":[{"poster":"YumaS2Astral","date":"2015-06-17T23:41:08.820+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I can see your points, but it is importante to note that taking into account Riven's shield, she is tankier than Fiora.

It occurs to me that you're level 8. I'm not trying to shut down your argument by pointing out inexperience, but if you're legitimately only level 8 your experience is vastly different from the one I'm accustomed to, where everyone has full runes and mastery pages. If you are indeed level 8, we're not even playing the same game. \n\nRiven's shield early on doesn't block a whole lot of damage. It is incapable of blocking all of the damage from Fiora's double Q combo alone, and naturally Fiora could easily wait until the shield is down to do the next Q. Keep in mind that much of Fiora's damage is sustained damage due to her auto-attacking nature, and the shield isn't reliable against sustained damage (for this reason Swain probably counters Riven as well). \n\nBuilding a single defense item isn't sacrificing anything for Riven. Most build a guardian angel. She took the randuin's to specifically counter Irelia, since Irelia is auto attack reliant, and the health helps counter her true damage. \n\nCare showing the game you are referencing?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"rtbf221146393","date":"2015-06-17T22:44:03.528+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=YumaS2Astral,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xeBAqpiY,comment-id=0007000100000000000000000000000000000001,timestamp=2015-06-17T22:33:18.587+0000)\n>\n> Riven has no true counters\n> \n> Even her so called counters can be beaten in some way\n> \n> Garen can have his silence baited and lose early duels;\n> Fiora is squishy\n> Renekton can't straight up 1x1 Riven\n> Teemo is squishy\n> Quinn is squishy\n> Malphite does not deal enough damage to stop Riven by late game, nor he has enough peeling power\n> Singed has a weak early game.\n\nGold 2 on BR.

It's the animation cancels that make them feel like they're good damage when they're fairly sub-par, simply because of how fast it happens. \n\nThe problem is not necessarily with the animation cancels in themselves, but their complete ease of use. Anyone can pick up Riven and potentially even accidentally animation cancel. What I could see them doing instead is making it more difficult to utilize so that it takes more skill to play Riven at a good level, meaning good Rivens are rewarded while players that only hear of her power through myths and legends will see her as \"that one champ that does meh damage.\" The current problem came in about 5 months ago through a change to overlapping CC effects, even though she's had animation cancelling for longer than that.","replies":[{"poster":"Vellich0r","date":"2015-06-17T21:11:57.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"yeah, all you have to do is rebind her laugh to T and you have a free animation cancel","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf221146393","date":"2015-06-17T21:13:26.163+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Marik Winters,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=xeBAqpiY,comment-id=00070000000000000001,timestamp=2015-06-17T21:11:57.525+0000)\n>\n> yeah, all you have to do is rebind her laugh to T and you have a free animation cancel\n\nLOL this is not animation cancelling.
