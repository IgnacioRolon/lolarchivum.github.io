Yes in an ideal world you won't switch targets mid Q. In the real world it is hard not to do while playing the game, even when you are actively trying to avoid it. That this statement has been added as work around in every (or at least most) post about the bug is really tone deaf to the players who play Nasus as it implies if you are experiencing this bug it is your fault.\n\nIn the future you are better off not explaining how to avoid a bug or give a work around when even the most vigilant of player will accidentally trigger it at least once a game (most likely in times of high action such as a teamfight).","replies":[{"poster":"DeynaTaggerung","date":"2015-09-10T22:18:13.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are going to fix it so by no means are you being offered a solution in that, but in the meantime it's something to take into consideration.","replies":[{"poster":"Guardman","date":"2015-09-10T22:52:02.757+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DeynaTaggerung,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=cqnWYtXG,comment-id=000a00010000,timestamp=2015-09-10T22:18:13.324+0000)\n>\n> They are going to fix it so by no means are you being offered a solution in that, but in the meantime it's something to take into consideration.\n\nI would like them to fix it.
