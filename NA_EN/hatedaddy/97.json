However, the big reason that there are some champions that are more-or-less dedicated to supporting is that they can be effective without having much in the way of gold or experience.  So the judgement on whether the support role is in a good spot is dependent on what your prerequisites for being a good spot are.\n\nBasically if you think supports need to be able to do their job then yes they are fine; if you think they should get similar amounts of gold and experience to the other roles then they aren't.","replies":[{"poster":"Miku Hime sama","date":"2015-04-25T10:15:43.739+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> However, the big reason that there are some champions that are more-or-less dedicated to supporting is that they can be effective without having much in the way of gold or experience.\n\nThe reason some champions are forced to support is because Riot gutted supports' sclaings in the pre-season 4 \"rework.\"  Hence why now it's become almost mandatory that if a support wishes to scale past laning, they have to look towards artificial scalings like Lich Bane or Echo which do misleading amounts of damage that players fool themselves into believing is part of that champion's damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Baron of Bread","date":"2015-04-25T16:59:32.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are looking at only damage scaling there, and a lot of supports are not focused on damage.
