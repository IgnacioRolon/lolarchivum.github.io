Shit of biblical proportions, natural disasters, etc\r\n\r\nWe are fucking good! The worst we get are tornados.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the west coast stretching to Colorado and even slightly further east are going to die instantly to the Yellowstone Super Volcano. If that doesn&#039;t get you first, the Cascadia Sunduction Zone will fuck the Pacific Northwest. But then the Super Volcano will erupt anyway. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile the east coast in 100 years is going to be under water and killed by, yep you know it, Sharknados. And Florida is always getting hurricanes galore, fuck that noise. \r\n\r\nSo when the world is ending and the super volcanoes of Yellowstone and Naples are destroying everything, us ohioans and Midwestern folk will be laughing, playing our banjos and breeding with our cousins as you all are melting, getting crushed, eaten by Sharknados and so on. \r\n\r\nOhio is love, Midwest is life","replies":[]}
