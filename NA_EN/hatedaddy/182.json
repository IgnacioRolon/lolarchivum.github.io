Here are some thoughts from a Nasus player I think you should hear.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":9,"down_votes":9,"body":"Good evening GDohlics. Your General Discussion Overlord HateDaddy here and more importantly, due to the subject, a long time Nasus main here. Nasus has been a touchy subject on these boards, largely due to the anal leakage oozes out from the bronze little booties of low elo baddies. I've fought tooth and nail with you guys to understand he's not broken and stats back this up, his lack of viability in pro play backs this up and so on but that doesn't seem to register. Alas, I digress.\r\n\r\nHowever, one of the other topics is how you all seem to hate having Nasus on your team! You see, believe it or not young GDoholics, there was once a time Nasus players were considered some of the most laid back, polite players in the game. Admittedly, the Sircheez and Trick2G fanboys may have stained the once good image of the Nasus player base and from a real, long term Nasus main, I'd like to apologize and say we are not represented by those estranged hooligans. There are a few things I'd like to address to open your minds to see things from our perspectives so you can coexist better with the Nasus players, the kind, laid back ones and the Sircheez and trixk2g degenerate fanboys alike.\r\n\r\n1: \"but HateDaddy! Nasus just AFK farms and never helps us! I hate having him on my time!\"\r\n\r\nWell little Cody, you see, you must see things from the  Nasus players perspective. Was there ever any real opportunity for him to TP bot? How many times was bot lane overextended with no wards? Is this Nasus' fault? Perhaps Nasus realizes there's no way in hell he can do anything against a team with Jarvan, Thresh, Orianna, Vayne and Gnar. Perhaps you should do your best to keep bot and mid pushed out to allow him to split push and force attention top lane and then counter shove. If the enemy appears to be going back and forth between defending your shove and Nasus' push, ping the enemy and look for a flank! Nasus will collapse and help yoh enjoy the win!\r\n\r\n2 \"HateDaddy, I always try to gank for Nasus early but he just farms and I die and he blames me for giving up double buffs, so toxic, wtf??\"\r\n\r\nWell little Johnny, perhaps it is you who is toxic! Did you hear all those pings saying to back off?? It was Nasus telling you not to go in! Want to know why? He was happily under tower with a lane frozen there. You ganking in a massive minion wave is a terrible idea and if you are counter ganked you are fucked. Let him do his thing early, it is best to gank for him mid or at least around level 5-6. Anything before that will be difficult as he offers little damage and often times can't complete a GANK well unless the top laner is squishy like Cass or Ryze. At that point, camp away. But when he tells you to back off, back off!\r\n\r\n3 \"HateDaddy mages have terrible itemization and they could honestly use a buff\"\r\n\r\n[heavy breathing]\r\n\r\n4 \"HateDaddy, what can I do to help Nasus out? I want to help him but I dont know how because we are bot lane.\"\r\n\r\nWow little Terrance, you have an incredible heart. One of the best things to do is set up wards in bushes and communicate that him teleporting on an overextended enemy bot lane is a free kill. The Nasus player, if a true top lane main, will understand an early won bot lane is an advantage he can't pass up and he will TP ASAP.\r\n\r\n5 \"but HateDaddy this Nasus wouldn't listen and raged in all chat and he was very toxic, what was his problem?\"\r\n\r\nWell little Phillip, he was probably a little trouble making hooligan redditor and a Sircheez and Trick2G fan. Sadly our overlord Nasus had the trick2cheez virus and is still battling it. Report this degenerate player for one simple thing: not being HateDaddy or his alter ego ChoGathsSon.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat concludes this broadcast. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. Once again, thank you for listening and choosing our product. Godspeed GD.","replies":[]}
