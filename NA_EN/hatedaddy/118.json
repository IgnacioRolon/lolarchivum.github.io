I&#039;ve played him since s2, well over a thousand games on him and I honestly don&#039;t think he&#039;s ever felt worse. \r\n\r\nThe game has probably just passed him by. Too much mobility, too easy to counter build, too immobile and too limited by his intentional weaknesses for his strengths to even shine. \r\n\r\nBut I know when he&#039;s not good and he&#039;s not good right now.

i guess not\neven in challenger there are many people that dont know how to play against him, simply because people see him in 1/1000 games in there. that's pretty much the only hope for a nasus player, because if enemy knows what they are doing (hint : coordinated jungler ganks) he becomes utterly useless for the rest of the game.\nhis only strong moment in the game is mid game and only if he is well farmed, but they almost took that away with broken rylais being built on every mage. perhaps this is why his win rate is trash atm\nso keep dreaming if you want, i'd bet you would argue with lcs players as well. i don't understand 1 thing tho, if nasus is a freelo champion why are you still sitting in low elo, can't climb with him?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ravenous Howls","date":"2016-08-05T16:32:32.191+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TyrionL,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=x1b4P2EV,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-08-05T04:00:29.176+0000)\n>\n> are u serious maybe YOU are not good?

I have extensive experience with him and know his strengths and weakness's. You are just a raging fool who thinks if he screams really loud he can drown out the truth. Either that or you are a flavor of the month player and thinks because he saw an LCS player do awesome that he can do awesome too... The dream... \n\nThe truth is Nasus is OP to new/bad players because they don't feel like learning how to coordinate their play or tactics to win. In Gold and higher he takes an extreme amount of extra patience to do well with against most competent players. There are far more oppressive champs in the game than \nNasus, who have insane amounts of mobility, range and kiting with overpowered items. \n\nFurther more none of your points are indicative of a Nasus play style only. Lot's of bad early game champs will \"hug\" turret and wait till they scale to kill their opponent. It is a tactic but I am sure different play styles outside of trading in creep waves is too much for you to comprehend and thus it is OP. \n\nGG! Go play a game where you can always win and never have to adapt or play differently. Mario comes to mind!

He has one (You can count right? I am not really sure as your intelligence and ability to cognitively reason is heavily in question) count one damaging ability his Q. The rest of his kit is balances around it. If you are arguing E is a damage ability you are a troll or the Nasus is building AP and he's a troll. Either way only Q has any significant damage to be considered.\n\nEvery other champion you mentioned has insane early game damage and trading potential early and can do half to 2/3 of his health with a successful combo. Riven, Ryze, Swain, Pantheon and many others have 2- 4 damaging abilities some form of harder CC and in some cases greater sustain. \n\nYour point about lane positioning and management is what EVERY OTHER champion does. So that is a completely useless argument to make your point. You are also complaining about him scaling and sustaining off farm. Almost all the other champions you mentioned have extreme early game pressure and snowball potential off one kill. Not only that they have much better chance to roam and pick up kills where Nasus needs to farm till he has some items to survive and stacks to deal significant damage and in a hard lane this will be 15 or 20 minutes and the game may be decided by then. So right there he has to work probably 10 times harder than every other champion to become relevant. \n\nI can only conclude you are a raging troll who likes to pick what everyone else calls OP, yes I checked your match history and you are clearly a flavor of the month player. Your KDA is atrocious in most of your games and you tend to die far more than you contribute. Your Nasus games are even more pathetic. You clearly have no concept on how to play the champion and thus have no right to offer objective criticism or ask for any changes.","replies":[{"poster":"Getcuxcd","date":"2016-08-08T12:16:00.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lazarus Blade,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=x1b4P2EV,comment-id=000600000000,timestamp=2016-08-08T02:01:26.479+0000)\n>\n> Nasus would never survive any point of the game, let alone his early game without his sustain.
