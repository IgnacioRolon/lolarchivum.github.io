That's the role responsible for making plays happen.

On top of that, I main GP. Getting dived by enemy top, jungle, and mid is no stranger to me. But if I can set aside my bias and realize that, (again except in edge cases like krug lvl 3) then you should realize that the jungle being able to show up in your lane early and force your flash and 80% of your hp means that **you** fucked up.

Thanks for asking! :)\n\nI liked it better when junglers didnt have such an XP advantage early game. I mean, you already get to walk into lanes to give a numbers advantage, why should you also be the biggest guy on the block as well? Junlger should, in my opinion, have an XP disadvantage to laners, since they have so much pressure to give across the map. This would also dissuade them from sitting in your lane bush for 3 minutes since they were already a level and a half up on you to kill you when you think its safe to farm again...
