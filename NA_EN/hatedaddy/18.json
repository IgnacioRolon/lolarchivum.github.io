I know people automatically assume this means he&#039;s weak or clearly something of a winrate like this suggests he&#039;s weak. I&#039;m going to explain why this shouldn&#039;t be so heavily considered with reworked champions, so just hear me out guys.\r\n\r\nWith new champions, when they have extremely low winrates like this it&#039;s one of two things: a very complex kit that takes time to learn or is actually very undertuned. Yasuo and Gnar come to mind, having very low winrates upon release and people automatically assumed they were garbage (i was guilty of this with Gnar). It took people time to figure them out but in that time, people figured out playstyles and builds and suddenly, they&#039;re overpowrred as all hell because you legit just buffed an extremely strong champion that people hadn&#039;t figured out yet.\r\n\r\nI know what you&#039;re thinking now: what in gods name does this have to do with reworked champions? Well, I&#039;ll explain. With reworked champions, in a sense, they&#039;re much like new champions because there&#039;s a lot of intrigue with them much the same way there is with newly released champions. I&#039;d imagine there&#039;s just as much attention paid to a newly released reworked champion as there is with a brand new champion altogether. \r\n\r\nHere&#039;s where you have to consider reworked champions on a totally different scale. With new champions, there is no reference point. Sure, champion spotlights will included suggested runes, masteries and builds but be honest, how many times have those been dead wrong? Sure they sound good in theory and in the right circumstances those suggested build paths and runes work but this is league where circumstances or so ever changing that it&#039;s hard to assume something is law upon new release and that same logic applies to builds, runes and masteries. So while the suggested builds and such are reference points, they aren&#039;t very good ones or reliable - they are guesstimations more or less (and that&#039;s not to discredit the people who come up with these, it makes sense at the time). \r\n\r\nSo with reworked champions, you have to consider this: why was the champion reworked in the first place? Typically, it&#039;s because the champion has gameplay that riot considers less than desirable and is either bad or stagnant enough that riot considers a small overhaul of their spells or transferring of power as a start. With reworked champions, you have the reference point of how they were once played and built and many people make the tragic mistake of trying to build them the same way as before the teworks (see Sion and how people kept trying to build him full AD). In many cases, this is flawed because typically these builds and play styles are a result of the gameplay riot was trying to remove or change in the first place. In Ryzes case, and this is speculation this isn&#039;t something I actually know, riot wanted to remove his power as a top lane bully with point and click harass early that scales into burst and DPS into late while still being insanely durable. This is why riot tries to remove FH from build path or at least make it w&#039;s purchase that wastes stats. This is why they made his Q a skill shot (which is what completely broke him in top lane and made him weaker in mid lane) so he&#039;d be less of a lane bully top and now suddenly mid lane looks more attractive.  So while Roa and Tear are still core, there&#039;s so much that&#039;s changed that you have to consider a new build path past those two items, that alone takes a lot of time to figure out.\r\n\r\nThen there&#039;s this: you have to consider his playstyle and how drastically it was changed. There&#039;s no hiding from it, old Ryze was one of the easiest champions in the game with very few decision points (Q off CD? Fire away). His only concerns as a top laner was being pretty squishy and avoiding ganks and when to use Rune prison for disengaging - that was the extent of his difficulty. That changed, oh man did that change in a big way. His passive changed, which is a huge decision point in managing in itself. His ult suddenly gives him more of a spike. His Q is a long range skillshot now as opposed to point and click. I could keep going on but you get the point: his playstyle ha drastically changed. In fact, it&#039;s changed so much that I think he&#039;s legit one of the hardest champions to play now. The increase in his skillcap is insane, I&#039;ve never seen this kind of change in a champions play style in my time that also made them super hard to play (Sion was a huge overhaul but he didn&#039;t suddenly become super hard to play, just slightly more difficult). \r\n\r\nI can&#039;t stress this enough, this was such an enormous change on a champion who was previously extremely unhealthy and now yoh could argue he&#039;s much healthier but as I noted, much harder. So it was a necessary change. But the point is, I suspect he&#039;s actually pretty good, it&#039;s just going to take a long time for people to figure all of the above out, which is actually a pretty unprecedented change when you consider reworks in league history (I&#039;m excluding beta here). Give it time, don&#039;t buff him now. I think he&#039;s much healthier so this isn&#039;t me saying this because I don&#039;t want Ryze in my games again, it&#039;s because I do believe he&#039;s strong and if you play this champion, the last thing you want is for riot to keep buffing him when he&#039;s actually strong and it turns out they push him way over the edge and they end up nerfing him so hard, he actually becomes weaker than he was perceived to be prior to the buffs in the first place. \r\n\r\nAs for builds, hey, I&#039;m really a fan of this:\r\n\r\n{{champion:13}} {{item:3027}} {{item:3040}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3152}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3800}} \r\n\r\nRunes: MS quints, scaling health yellows, spell pen reds, MR blues (scaling/flat depending on match up)\r\n\r\nMasteries: 21/9 (9/21 actually doesn&#039;t feel bad either).\r\n\r\nSome other items that aren&#039;t bad: {{item:3065}} (good vs heavy AP teams)\r\n{{item:3110}} (you waste the 20% CDR but the mana and armor is nice against heavy AD teams)\r\n{{item:3025}} (you don&#039;t waste CDR but sheen is kind of meh on him, as is the IBG proc since you don&#039;t AA too much on Ryze outside of lane phase; it might be really good though, idk yet)\r\n\r\nThe build I provided though gives him everything he likes. Mana, HP, damage, pen and spell vamp, which I think he&#039;s become an extremely good spell vamp champion. RG is just so good with his ult for chasing targets down as well. WOTA gives him the 10% that caps him out in CDR and it&#039;s nice AP and spell vamp, again, that synergies with his ult. \r\n\r\nThere&#039;s also a few other items like {{item:3157}}  and {{item:3285}} that could be built over RG and potentially WOTA (and you could get the remaining CDR from runes and masteries). I love spel vamp Ryze, so it&#039;s bias. I think getting 10% CDR from runes and masteries and building Ludens is hella good too.\r\n\r\nBut do you see what I mean guys? Look at all this shit he can build and the vastly different playstyle patterns he potentially has with these builds now. How can we determine that he needs buffs after such a short time of being reworked so heavily and expect anything good to come of it? Give it a few more patches, I&#039;d say until 5.13 at the very least. I really do think new Ryze is good.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-05-12T04:05:46.888+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"We're on the same page regarding major reworks, in that they introduce enough change that there's going to be a readjustment period and that means a champion's performance is going to drop for a while.

It's a designed weakness, not a death sentence. And you have a 900 range Q, so even if they blink as you land W or just throw Q, chances are you still hit them.

But I cannot stress enough how this rework is almost on the same magnitude of Sion's rework - I don't put anything up there because let's face it, reworked Sion was basically a new champion. I know there isn't exactly a manual on this and at the end of the day, buffing him and overtuning him is probably a much easier fix than leaving him in poor shape. But I really do believe there's a lot of strength in this new kit and the flexibility of his build path right down to his runes and masteries is insane. Given his skillcap increase, I think there is also a very good chance that Ryze keeps a lower winrate much the same way many extremely powerful champions have in the past (see pre silence removal Leblanc as an example). I'm just iffy is all and after all this is only opinion based on very little facts - I also have the benefit of not having to answer to anyone if he turns out to be extremely weak. I'm just expressing here I think he's strong and it could potentially take a long time to figure him out in general. But that's also why I kind of went over builds for him and runes and masteries, even if this thread becomes a discussion point for that alone, maybe it helps. Who knows.

In teamfighting, he's long ranged enough to DPS down the front line from a safe distance. You're blowing this out of proportion. \n> \n\nAgain you missed my point completely. If you hit him with a stun, silence, or knock-up when you see his passive go up you effectively nullify his damage. Many champs have cc on a short enough cooldown to do this to him pretty much every time his passive is up.\n\n> *In any given situation either Q or E will be not good\n> \n> How do you draw this conclusion? His Q is spammble, it's always good. \n>\n\nAgain you show how little you actually understand Ryze. Either the enemy is in a group of units, in which case you won't be able to land your Q, or they are on their own, in which case his E does no damage. \n \n> * When you do get off your combo, it doesn't do enough damage to feel rewarding\n> \n> Are we talking about Ryze? Because a full Ryze combo melts squishies and DPS's tanks for days.\n>\n\nYes, and I am talking specifically about the laning phase here. It is very hard to get your entire combo off, and when you do, your opponent is usually sitting at 1/3 health and  you are OOM. Granted you won the trade, but you have no kill pressure, and even if you force them out of lane, you have to go back too because you have burned through your entire mana pool.\n \n> *CDR on his ulti is wasted stat. Many items he wants to build have CDR on them and during his window of power CDR is basically useless.\n> \n> It's not a wasted stat, it means he doesn't have to itemize it. It's a GREAT stat. There's plenty of mana items Like RoA, Tear, Righteous Glory, Iceborn Gauntlet (which can complete the remaining 10% CDR btw). Basically, Riot didn't want him building a Frozen Heart because there's no reason for a Ranged DPS/Burst mage to be as durable as a Bruiser.\n> \n\nAgain it appears that you don't understand Ryze at all. Because his CDR during his window of power is based on the cooldown of his Q, he casts no faster during that window at 40% CDR then at 0%. That means that CDR is a very inefficient stat on him.\n\n> *Mana costs force him out of lane before most of his top lane opponents\n> \n> He's better mid lane now, he's also a champion you should always be running TP on for early tear. Suddenly mana costs aren't a problem.\n> \n\nIf you think all his mana problems in lane are solved by tear I'm not sure why you're even talking about him.\n\n> * One of the most easily kited champs in the game\n> \n> Just lol. Have you ever played an immobile melee champion before? Don't talk to be about being kited when one rune prison on a carry equals instant death for them.\n\nExcept that  pretty much every every melee champ has a way to reengage once their opponent creates some space.  Once you get one step out of 600 range, Ryze has no options. \n\nLook I get it, you're a Nasus main and don't want a champ around that can potentially poke you off your farm, just please stop pretending like you understand this champ or his strengths and weaknesses.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mandang0","date":"2015-05-12T07:14:03.512+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree that Riot should consider the delay it takes the playerbase to learn a champ before seeing the low winrate and deciding it needs buffs.\n\nHowever, I don't think Ryze's problem is his build, it's his newfound reliance on a passive that can time out.  It adds a Gnar-like downside to Ryze where he doesn't benefit from any of Gnar's strengths.  I think if Riot just let Ryze hold onto his passive charges indefinitely, Ryze would be a ton better (maybe too good, idk).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sulidaire","date":"2015-05-13T16:37:29.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think Ryze's passive is his major downfall. It's actually interesting to work with. It's controllable, like Jax's Ult passive and Vlad's E. Yes, it's obvious to predict but I don't think that's his weakness right now. I think the problem with Ryze is his laning. Always has been always will be. Where he stands right now, his counterplay is easy, stand behind your minions, don't get hit by his Q, you see a couple of runes around him? Wait it out. The problem with that is his kill potential in lane overall feels low and frustrating. Old Ryze players went from \"I'm going to kill ya,\" to \"Let's see if I can do something here.\" Ryze's Q does not feel rewarding to hit. It's out of place and boring, underpowered kinda. If you hit it, cool you did some poke damage, one step closer to killing someone. On any champ this is fine, but this is Ryze, it's his collective spell output that makes him unique and powerful. With it being a skillshot, that can be negated by standing behind minions, it feels inconsistent to the rest of kit. You fire out spells that are single target point and click, you don't worry about that. It's taunting us of what the old Ryze used to be. What if Ryze's Q was a skillshot that can go through minions but still be dodged and single targeted? Xerath ultesque maybe? Where it stands now, his Q doesn't feel impactful as a main damage output in lane. \nOverall, I think this rework was headed in the right direction but feels sloppy. His mana shield feels more like a gimmick as a better chunk of his damage now comes from AP. It kinda states, \"Hey remember Ryze likes to build mana.\" Sure it does add to his tankiness and has saved my ass more often then not but it feels like a cheap outlet to remind us of old Ryze. Same with his ult, built in CDR? Another cheap outlet to force us to build something other than Frozen heart. \nWhat I think should've been done is exploring his theme of being a rapid fire mana building mage. What if his damage output gets better every time he hits a spell? What if he didn't have to rely on CDR to rapidly fire out spells or at all for that matter?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-05-13T11:24:01.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HateDaddy is pulling out some quality threads.\n\nI approve.\n\nAnd happen to agree.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MealReadytoEat","date":"2015-05-12T19:37:33.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another thing is rune prison is really unreliable with regard to distance and vision.

Please make it apply at the start of the cast animation, or at least always go off if you start the cast. I'd also like if they made it a edge-to-edge targeting so that it matches his auto-attack range, currently I can often auto without being in spell range. Making it grant vision of the snared target would also help; I've had instances where I snare someone, only to be unable to continue my combo because I lost vision of them in the bush.","replies":[]},{"poster":"stvnstar","date":"2015-05-12T19:34:10.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If he does need more power can we try to add it slowly? Like instead of his entire passive dropping of at once he losses a stack on his passive one at a time?

It also wouldn't be that much of a buff to keep his passive up around 3 or 4 stacks because he would need to use his mana during that time making him a walking time bomb until he is much more useless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MealReadytoEat","date":"2015-05-12T19:18:13.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've played well over 50 games with the new Ryze, mostly in the jungle. Overall, he seems pretty weak, even though I've had pretty good luck with him. There's a quality-of-life buff I feel he really needs. When he cast his q, he continues his previous order after the casting animation, but not on his w or e. Adding this to his w and e would make playing him effectively (Cast kite Cast kite Cast kite) MUCH easier. I hope this is an easy fix, and not something hard programmed in skill shots and not in targets spells. The life sentence to rune prison is pretty sweet and rewarding when executed right.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-05-12T15:48:00.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i feel like new Ryze is one of those champions who, in a balanced state, will always have a sub-50% win rate, or barely 50%. His passive is pretty tough to manage, and I imagine the vast majority of players never fully mastering it, save a few dedicated players.\n\nThat being said, the powers spike he gets with the passive plus proper combo usage is night and day, honestly really massive, and his kit without it isn't too terrible, he can still play safe with the long range Q and his W. If you know how to manage your cooldowns and have all of them up, you can pretty much fight at 2 stacks and up, I think.\n\nThe thing I struggle with (me being something of a meter stick for the average player) is managing my cooldowns and passive in conjunction with engages in order to really utilize it, and also just comboing with that 0.25 second limit between spells. It's probably easier if you max w second for the longer duration so you don't have to orb walk during your combo, but I've found myself canceling spells since I try to spam my spells too quickly. Basically my problem is that his passive is tough to manage, and even when you have it, it's somewhat difficult to utilize since your casts need to be well timed and very cleanly executed, not to mention he's still short ranged.\n\nI guess the distinction is, is he strong? Absolutely, he can be very strong, his passive proc is a massive power spike, and he's not totally helpless without it. But is he *good*? I guess it's kind of like asking if champions like Gnar, LeBlanc, Azir, Zed, etc are good. Sure they're powerful, many would say overwhelmingly so, but that power is largely inaccessible to much of the player base, because of differences in skill level of the players. For the average player, these champions aren't good, and statistically will lose them more games, even if they are powerful. It's kind of that age old question of who Riot should balance for, pros or your average player, and I'm on the side of the former, which is why I think Ryze won't, or shouldn't, have a win rate higher than 50%.\n\nI think if Ryze receives any changes going forward, it should focus on usability instead of number buffs, since it isn't that he's weak per se, just his power is pretty difficult to access for the majority of players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NorthernDruid","date":"2015-05-12T10:09:14.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"New Ryze feels overall fine. I'm really happy with the rework.\n\nI feel like he has two real issues currently though. Mostly relating to his window of opportunity.\n\nBasically, he's got two steroids that he relies on to do more than lightly poke. His passive and his Ult, the problem is that the duration is so short, especially at low levels. The duration could very much use a slight uptuning across all levels (but especially pre level 11). As it is, any CC at all and you're out of the fight until you can proc your passive again.\n\nThe second issue is with his passive exclusively, and it's more thorough for his playstyle.\n\nRyze's playstyle has always been about constantly spamming spells to charge his tear, the faster you fill your tear the faster you hit your real game.\n\nRyze's new passive now punishes you for not pacing yourself very carefully so that you'll only trigger the last hit when you really can go in on your opponent. So one of Ryze's core items directly drive him against managing his passive properly.\n\nThe other problem with how his passive stacks up is with how predictable it is, if you can't go in on the fifth hit, then you lose out on all your stacks for another cycle. The passive is painful to manage because you have to keep casting spells... but not too much, except for when you need to go all in faster than the opponent can get out of W range.\n\nWhat Ryze really needs, is for his stacks to decay dynamically, one at a time, rather than all at once. That way you're rewarded for pacing yourself over an extended period of time, without the enemy being rewarded with their own windows of opportunity by the very nature of your kit.\n\n---\n\nOn the nature of builds, if you already have capped out your CDR but still want spellvamp, get a Gunblade on him. You lose out on no AP, no spellvamp, get some AD, some lifesteal and that active which scales with AP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Edge of Daybreak","date":"2015-05-12T07:39:24.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see why the build would be a problem. He could have built all of this stuff before and still been a better champion. The issue I have with him is that his Q is just damage with no bonus effect on it at all. For a skillshot to have nothing else attached feels weird. Next his passive having such a small uptime with such a large mana cost required to get it active. Either lower his mana cost or up its duration. As previously suggested letting his passive stack like annies would be great!. It could potentially be too strong but seeing his numbers he needs a lot of work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hard4Hamsters","date":"2015-05-12T04:24:55.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm with you. I used to main Ryze before the rework to an extent, and I think he's kinda OP right now. His W can be used 2 times within his passive and will be off of cooldown when his passive expires, giving him a lot of lockdown potential. I know it's going to take sometime for people to build him and play him correctly and I would hope the balance team refrains from giving him any major buffs to his kit. I wouldn't wait until 5.13 to implement buffs if he remains underpowered after people start to get used to him, but I would not be planning anything for 5.10 just yet. Maybe 5.11 would be a time to introduce small buffs (like seriously, small) if he stays unsuccessful. \n\nAs a side note, Abyssal is getting a rework at some point soon, so I think Ryze might be getting ninja buffed with that change. \n\nThe build I like on Ryze right now: {{item:3027}} {{item:3040}} {{item:3265}} {{item:3285}} (or Deathcap depending on how game was going) {{item:3135}} and item of choice. I like to get Armor on Ryze as they nerfed his armor and resistances are really good on Ryze thanks to his shield and spell vamp. The options for that are {{item:3143}} {{item:3026}} {{item:3075}} and even {{item:3110}} though the CDR is wasted. I think one of the most important things to note is Merc Treads are more important than ever before, because if you get stunned or silenced long enough during your Passive, you are pretty much useless, so you really want that tenacity. IF the enemy team has low CC though, grab Sorc's as they will give you a lot of damage after all of your MR shred. I run a strange rune page right now for Ryze so I can have 10% from Runes/Masteries. I run 2 MS quints and 1 CDR, I also run 3 glyphs of scaling CDR and 6 scaling MR, 4 armor Seals and 5 armor/lvl, and for reds I go Magic pen. On my mastery  page I'm running 21/9/0 taking only 2 in sorcery so I can have the most damage from the offense tree as I can. I prefer this to 0/9/21 Ryze of old, due to Ryze's increased AP scaling and cut Mana scaling. I could just cut my losses with CDR and pick it up in an item, but I really don't like any CDR items on Ryze for an every game build. WoTA i guess I should try as it would potentially keep Ryze alive as long as he keeps fighting and his passive is proccing constantly. But I feel so squishy if I don't get any armor. I guess another option would be to swap it for Void or Luden's/Deathcap but I feel like that would cut out your damage too much. \n\nAnyway. Good luck to you. Have fun out there.
