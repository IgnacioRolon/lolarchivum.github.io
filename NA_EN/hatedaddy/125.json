There&#039;s not much you can do to weaken his early game minus making his HP pool or shield weaker because he has no resources and low cooldowns. \r\n\r\nBut champions that generally beat Yasuo don&#039;t beat bruiser Yasuo. You can pick it into counter match ups and still win because you&#039;re able to stave off attack speed slows with Q/trinity procs and literally just be hard as fuck to kill. This isn&#039;t healthy, I do agree with many on here that these bruiser off builds aren&#039;t good for the game and they shouldn&#039;t be working. Sure, if you get ahead and snowball, it&#039;s whatever. But a champion like Yasuo who is designed to function off of crit isn&#039;t even building crit and is electing to go with bruiser builds, you&#039;ve made damage too accessible in other areas while you can still cash in on durability from high HP items like Frozen Mallet and Steraks. \r\n\r\nOnce again, I mostly blame keystones for this. Keystones are giving these offbuilds better scaling, which bruiser builds as off builds as a generalization fall off pretty hard. But because of shit like Fervor, TLD and even Grasp (which does decent damage too, especially with HP stacking), you&#039;re seeing all sorts of champions and champions with off-builds outputting amounts of damage they simply shouldn&#039;t be outputting. \r\n\r\nYou guys seriously need to look into adjusting keystones because they offer too much power. They have made this game a nightmare to balance on so many levels.","replies":[{"poster":"venomous frost","date":"2016-08-18T18:42:20.177+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":12,"body":"Why is it that fervor is only broken on bruiser yasuo?
