And no, most people don&#039;t actually give a shit what you play as long as we can find a way as a team to make it work. \r\n\r\nBut when you say you&#039;re going AD Heimer bot because you didn&#039;t get the role you wanted and you want to troll us - which lets be honest, this is the case the majority of the time - then expect to get reported. Youre getting reported for trolling because you didn&#039;t get your role and refused to communicate with the team when we asked you not to do that, not because we are meta sheep. \r\n\r\nWe are trying to win, this is ranked. I&#039;m going to let people basically play anything but if something odd is picked, I&#039;m going to look that player up. If they main it or have success with it, have at it. But if you lose the majority of your games with it, I&#039;m going to say something because again I&#039;m trying to win. I&#039;m not being a meta sheep when I don&#039;t want you playing AP Fiora top (and this is legit, I&#039;m not making this one up). You have a 20% winrate with it, and it only works if your opponent is retarded. I&#039;m going to ask you not to do it because I want to win. Play normal Fiora, shits broken. \r\n\r\nSo in short, stop throwing this around because you want to troll or just &quot;play what you want&quot; despite it being terrible or you having terrible success with it.
