Tanks durability spike in the mid game where it honestly can take 10 full seconds of focus from an entire team to kill them if they&#039;ve managed to get ahead, but generally it&#039;s more around 6-7 seconds. Either way you slice it, this is incredibly durable.\r\n\r\nI also keep seeing people throw around the excuse that all this flat pen exists, flat pen is not good vs tanks. If I hear one more person make this implication, I&#039;m going to freak out. \r\n\r\n&quot;B-b-but black cleaver!!!&quot;\r\n\r\nIf an ADC has built black cleaver, it means in the mid game they don&#039;t have any crit, attack speed, lifesteal and even a significant amount of ad. Sure, ADCs that can function more like casters can still hurt but their DPS is going to be so low they will still take awhile to kill a tank because they don&#039;t attack fast enough. \r\n\r\nAll of this non sense about tanks dying in 2-3 seconds late game are extreme scenarios where you&#039;re engaging 1v5. If you&#039;re playing a tank properly, you&#039;re not going to die in 2-3 seconds.\r\n\r\nI play a lot of malphite and Maokai and trust me, even when I don&#039;t do too well in lane, I still take forever to kill because I play to zone control and force priority targets to kite me, then I disengage and make them choose  between chasing me and as a result, this could force them into bad position and at the very least it prevents them from moving past the front line to clean up low hp targets. \r\n\r\nWhen ADCs build LD, they are not &quot;denying&quot; your ability to be a tank. A tanks sole purpose isn&#039;t to damage soak. You can&#039;t expect to stand still and live for longer than 5-6 seconds from unretaliated damage from a full glass cannon build. Instead of whining about dying so fast either:\r\n\r\nA) kill the full glass cannon zero defense champion \r\n\r\nOr\r\n\r\nB) protect yours then kill their full glass cannon zero defense champion\r\n\r\nTanks have to be killable, if they aren&#039;t killable in the late game then tanks become such a dominant class that you see 4-5 tanks a game between both teams and that isn&#039;t healthy variety.\r\n\r\nso please start being realistic, tanks are not melting all at an extreme rate. and I play plenty of tanks so it&#039;s not like I&#039;m some anti-tank player whining from bias, I&#039;m telling you tanks are fine. \r\n\r\nAnd p.s, the secret to gaining elo is protecting your carries instead of engaging 1v5. You&#039;d be amazed how long you live when you try this in combination with zone controling.","replies":[{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2016-08-17T22:13:41.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Mages should easily destroy tanks, alas, we cannot","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2016-08-17T22:17:00.514+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Calabok,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=KgWnIF1E,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2016-08-17T22:13:41.070+0000)\n>\n> Mages should easily destroy tanks, alas, we cannot\n\nif mages and adc can easily destroy tanks, then it makes usually 2 to 3 members on the enemy team who can do that.\n\nwho are tanks supposed to tank then? the enemy support? the other tank? why even take one along, if he gets shredded anyways? \n\nyes, tanks contribute to a large part with their utility, but a shitload of their power budget is in their defenses. when those are worthless, so are tanks. \n\nyoud just replace them with another mage whos also able to inititate and contribute with utility, but also brings a load of damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HateDaddy","date":"2016-08-17T22:27:51.702+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Calabok,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=KgWnIF1E,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2016-08-17T22:13:41.070+0000)\n>\n> Mages should easily destroy tanks, alas, we cannot\n\nMages jobs are not to just kill targets, they offer utility too and their goal isn't to burst a tank.
