From a solo queue stand point, Lee Sin has always remained below a 50% winrate. However, keep in mind he has a ridiculously high pick rate and ban rate, which should be alarming in its own right but thats not enough to condemn a champion to death. Although its been done in the past to several other junglers.\n\nThe point is this: this is the 3rd major jungle change we've seen. This change goes above and beyond anything we've seen. This jungle is more about strategic approach, considering routes matters now. Objective control is still important but its enhanced in gameplay times a million now.\n\n Yes I know, Warwick is an abomination right now but Riot correctly forecasted that he would likely be a problem. After his changes and with competitive play starting up soon, we are going to see whats really strong. In my mind, all indications suggest Lee Sin is still a god tier jungler but I will want to see more than just my suspicions to prove that. And if he is, Riot, after all the major changes we've seen to the jungle the past 4 seasons, its time to admit Lee Sin is a serious problem in this game. Because history tells us when Lee Sin is good, he dicates whats good in the jungle (I.E something that can keep up with him until its brutally nerfed). And if Lee does that again, theres nothing in the world you can do to change that except address Lee Sin for real this time.","replies":[{"poster":"Knight SoIaire ","date":"2014-12-06T10:41:40.692+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":2,"body":"let me fix it for you\n\n\"if lee sin is god tier in every jungle it means that lee sin is the problem \"\n\nwhatever items there are, whatever strenght do camps posses, whatever is other junglers power, lee sin is always staying at the top \n\nmy personal opinion is that its fault of his overly flexible kit that scales up with skill \nin medium elo lee is barely medicore because he fails off late and is realy unreliable (miss a q and gank failed, die once and you have no game) \nwhile in high elo lee pulls of every gank and doesnt fall off, he switches role from assasin to a support and his kit allows that\n\nhence he is always god tier jungler in lcs, he just offers more for a price of skill that lcs players can pay ","replies":[{"poster":"MrSexyHobo","date":"2014-12-06T19:01:38.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"garen rapes lee in a 1v1. that being said garen is a C- when it comes to jungling","replies":[{"poster":"Azlagor","date":"2014-12-06T19:15:59.974+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"just that garren sucks at prettymuch everything else as a jungler, and he can't force lee to an 1v1, so even that barly helps him...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"57740961_DEL","date":"2014-12-06T19:32:02.756+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> let me fix it for you\n> \n> \"if lee sin is god tier in every jungle it means that lee sin is the problem \"\n> \n> whatever items there are, whatever strenght do camps posses, whatever is other junglers power, lee sin is always staying at the top \n> \n> my personal opinion is that its fault of his overly flexible kit that scales up with skill \n> in medium elo lee is barely medicore because he fails off late and is realy unreliable (miss a q and gank failed, die once and you have no game) \n> while in high elo lee pulls of every gank and doesnt fall off, he switches role from assasin to a support and his kit allows that\n> \n> hence he is always god tier jungler in lcs, he just offers more for a price of skill that lcs players can pay \n\nGanks don't always fail if you miss a Q, in fact initiating with a ward hop W is often much more reliable than trying to land a Q for shorter distances or when they're behind a creep wave.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AetherKingdom","date":"2014-12-06T18:43:52.246+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":45,"body":"Lee sin isn't fucking OP.

They openly say they play the most OP things in the game because its the best chance of winning - nobody faults them for this, money is on the line and this is competition. But when Lee Sin is in every game and has been nerfed as much as he has been, theres a problem. \n\nYou cant say we spam OPs to win but the suddenly say \"yeah but Lee isn't OP!\" How is it that a long list of junglers, who are OP at their times, get nerfed to hell and Lee is still god tier when they are until they are nerfed. Of course pros will say hes balanced, hes basically every good junglers crutch - and I dont mean that in a way to demean their skills, i say that because its true. Theres a reason every top jungler in the world mains him. Consider this, as I noted above, Lee Sin is historically the most nerfed champion in this game. And. Hes. Still. God. Tier. Think about that and let it sink in. What the actual fuck, right? Its because he has too much stuff and it allows him to dictate the jungle and its meta. If thats not OP, I don't know what is.\n\nAnd further to that point, pros are paid to play, not balance. I respect their knowledge but lets not pretend they cant be wrong. How many times has doublelift said adcs will be trash tier hurrr.

He has low win ratio because after all those nerfs he finally needs skills to be good and you can say whatever you want but i will never believe that, champion who you use first time and you have positive k/d is a champion who \"require skill\". Before anyone who play lee sin had positive k/d, and skilled ones were terribly op, now finally he requires brain to build and and skill, because you are lost without it. At my gold elo i see pure dmg leesins and they wonder why they lose games....\n\nI think lee is okay now and he will lose his popularity over time and other champion will take his place and will be found as top tier op (actually my bet is sejuani)","replies":[{"poster":"Orangesilk","date":"2014-12-07T11:16:11.104+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sejuani got preemptively nerfed this patch so that no one may even risk Lee Sin having competition.\n\nWW got a total of ONE patch of being insanely strong to get himself nerfed, unlike Lee who has been at it for YEARS.\n\nLee Sin is not balanced because \"His winrate means he requires skill\", think of it this way, a bad Lee Sin is basically dead weight, or even bad for the team (If you have ever been saved by a kick from a stupid Lee Sin trying to steal a kill raise your hand), on the other hand, a good Lee Sin, which is less common, will completely stomp your team, deny your jungler, and turn the first 20 minutes of the game into a living nightmare, is this balanced?. NO, THIS NOT BALANCED, because my 10-people game should not by any means be determined by the skill of a single player on a difficult champion.","replies":[]}]}]}
