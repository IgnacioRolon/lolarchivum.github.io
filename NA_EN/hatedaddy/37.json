But we gotta go over the rules dawg.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":37,"down_votes":15,"body":"Let&#039;s get started. First off, you see this badge? Yeah, Diamond. No backtalk. You&#039;re in my world now grandma. This is my house, my yard, my digital domain - what I say is law around these parts. You smell me son? Pick up what I&#039;m putting down? Alright, good. Because you see, Keyru backtalked me the other day and I had to ban her, I really don&#039;t want to have to ban you. So let&#039;s keep this shit real and dirty and stay classy on the haters out here.\r\n\r\nSo let&#039;s start actually going over these rules: \r\n\r\n1) Diamond, no backtalk. You cannot backtalk a diamond unless you are equal or higher rank. Higher rank prevails, meaning if you&#039;re the lower ranked Diamond, you cannot backtalk the higher ranked Diamond because no backtalk. Unless you&#039;re me, I&#039;m the exception because I&#039;m older than you and I&#039;ve been to Halifax before.\r\n\r\n2) respect the tribes. We all have our own little tribes, often referred to as circle jerks. But when it may appear that we are violently tearing each other a new one with maximum ass blasting, understand there is a mutual respect between all of us and many of us are acquaintances at the very least, if not friends. Sometimes though, we will go all out and war is necessary but once the bloodshed stops and the war ends, we hit dat rock (fist pump/shake hands), call it a day and move on. Game recognizes game.\r\n\r\n3) There&#039;s only one way to meme: hard in the paint. Sometimes, we just gotta go ham on dey bitch asses and meme like a muhfucka. When that happens, you either join the meme team or you get out the way. \r\n\r\n4) Realize almost nothing here is serious. Self explanatory, we&#039;re troll as fuck.\r\n\r\n5) I forgot the rest but I&#039;m allowed to make it up as I go so it doesn&#039;t really matter.\r\n\r\nSo these are the rules that you must follow or I&#039;ll be forced to take action against you and adminster punishment. Around these parts, if the glove fits, you fucking ban their asses and see, I don&#039;t play that, I&#039;m master banhammer. I banned Lyte once but then he slapped the shit out of me with his PHD and we squared up and I bodied him. Then we shook hands like men and I allowed Lyte back to GD for manning up. I respect the hustle too, but if you violate these rules, I&#039;m gonna have to come down hard with the pimp hand.","replies":[]}
