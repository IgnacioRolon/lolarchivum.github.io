Everything he hopes to do with farm is done better and more consistently by other fighters. In the past, when fighters were good, the upside of managing to get farm on Nasus was god tier mode late game with a 95% AS/MS slow, incredibly hard to kill, 700 range on wither and great front lining.\r\n\r\nThis was season 2 Nasus and the rewards were worth the risk of you managed to get farm. But since then, a lot of things have changed. He&#039;s been nerfed hard and never compensated one bit for any of those nerfs. The game has become ridiculously even more mobile while also granting these mobile champions CC to kite and stay away from Nasus indefinitely. He has no means to drain tank front lines because armor stackers on front lines reduce the effectiveness of Lifesteal meaning his one source of recovering health is heavily countered. The 600 HP on ult he gets is just another auto attack from a full build carry. He has no defensive steroids, no mobility, his strengths have been stripped away and he&#039;s a shell of his former self. It&#039;s why he hasn&#039;t been picked at all this season in competitive play and won&#039;t be.\r\n\r\nI am convinced at this point, a rework is much better than buffs. The only thing I see buffs doing is pushing him to a point where he&#039;s just a wall of stats you can&#039;t overcome and quite frankly, that&#039;s bullshit. I don&#039;t want my champion to be Irelia 2.0. And honestly, when he has been good, that&#039;s kind of what he was. So I can&#039;t see a scenario where you buff him with his current kit and put him in a state where he&#039;s worth playing unless you buff him so hard, he just becomes a walking wall of destruction you can&#039;t deal with. Riot has gone away from that concept and has for awhile.\r\n\r\nI am convinced you can keep his stacking Q mechanic in place. It doesn&#039;t even necessarily have to be an infinite stacking mechanic but it does need to be something worth stacking because at his core, that is his identity. Wither as a point and click disable probably just needs to go, I suspect you can turn this spell more into a mobility/MS boost spell that is granted additional effects from other spells - as an example, if Nasus casts wither on you and hits you with Q, your AD is reduced by 15% or something along those lines while having a different spell effect with E. I think his ult is honestly fine as it is, it was a spell that was honestly ahead of its time when it was made. I also think a HP% return on his W isn&#039;t out of the question so he can actually drain tank front lines in some facet.\r\n\r\nI suspect this won&#039;t be popular amongst other Nasus mains, but the truth is after playing a lot of Jax lately, I just see no reason to ever play Nasus again. It&#039;s too frustrating. And I hate that because he&#039;s my favorite champion and I just want him to be good but not overbearing. And I just don&#039;t see a way his current kit can ever be good without it being overtuned as hell to compensate for how much this game has indirectly shit on his existence with CC/mobility galore attatched to every kit.\r\n\r\nI also realize he&#039;s not even close to a priority to rework because there are others who&#039;ve waited much longer and need it just as much, if not more. And they&#039;ve been in line much longer, too. But I am at a point where I see no other options for him other than a full-on rework.","replies":[{"poster":"Budupops","date":"2015-09-23T23:15:22.854+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":4,"body":"he got compensated 25 range on q.\ncase closed","replies":[{"poster":"HateDaddy","date":"2015-09-23T23:20:20.155+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Budupops,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NP9VhX5l,comment-id=0010,timestamp=2015-09-23T23:15:22.854+0000)\n>\n> he got compensated 25 range on q.\n> case closed\n\nlol","replies":[{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2015-09-24T20:56:56.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want to say that I'd like the R to give him 20/30/40% bonus health for some odd seconds with the usual damage to those near him.

When they're strong or ahead, they're not like ADCs or mages that you can catch out of position, CC, and burst down, you have to spend tons of time and resources chain-CCing them and slowly burning them down, and if they have their team with them they become impossible to deal with. That's what they're _meant_ to be (ok, Garen less so, but the others fit that mold perfectly), and it's what they would be even if they were balanced. Nasus fits the same exact mold, he's just less effective than they are; in fact, I'd go so far as to say that Nasus is the original Juggernaut, the first Juggernaut-style champion that was ever added to the game long before Riot had to idea to rework this bunch of champions.\n\nDon't get me wrong here, I'm not making a \"nerf juggernauts\" post.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-09-24T03:32:32.405+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"He just a painful jackass to deal with all game, I just dread playing against him, not because he is overpowered or anything the lane is just boring as hell, and you don't ever win it, you just delay the inevitable.

I'll brainstorm a few ideas. All random suggestions that have nothing to do with each other.\n---\n#Passive\n+ **Truesteal** - Basically like the new WotA, his basic attacks and Q will proc lifesteal equal to the amount of damage he would have done before resistances. Only problem with this is that it kills some of the synergy with Hydra. Perhaps have him apply it on all physical damage dealt then? Anyway, moving on.\n+ **Completely New Passive?** - removal of this passive in favor of a new one (possibly move this one to Q if it is absolutely needed).\n\n#Q\n+ **Added Cripple Effect** - If you've spent awhile on these boards you may have heard this suggestion tossed around a few times. Basically what it does is temporarily disable the afflicted target's dash/blink/self-displacement abilities. This definitely would not belong on Wither, that'd just make Wither broken. It'd be more balanced attached to Q. This effect would last 1 second and possibly have a rapidly decaying slow _(talking like, from 30% -> 0% over 0.5 seconds or something)_ attached to it in order to emphasize and better communicate the fact that it cripples. _(Maybe have some sort of icon for it as well)_\n+ **Cooldown Unaffected by CDR--Stacks Reduce CD** - This would open up more build paths to him, allowing him to diverge from FH and SV as mandatory rush items _(though CDR is only half the reason he builds those items, but still, more options)._ As to how much CDR is granted per stack I don't know, but it could tie into this:\n+ **Gain New Effects in a Stack Tier System** - Effects like the above mentioned ones. Personally think they should come at the cost of some damage on Q or perhaps just a limit on Q's max damage.\n\n#W\n+ **Remove** - Removing this would solve many problems, as you said, but this is such an iconic skill of his that I'd hate for it to come to that\n+ **Wither Cloud** - As it sounds, it instead creates a controllable Wither pet cloud like Viktor's ult that increases the potency of the slow for every second a target remains in it. Size could increase with level. This will, however, remove its reliability as a targeted shut down ability. But maybe that's what's needed.\n+ **Wither AoE** - Instantly applies Wither to all targets in cone/circular area/line in front of him. Would still be basically unavoidable, retaining the reliability of it but also allowing him to apply it to more targets. This would allow the potency of it _(raw slowing power)_ to be nerfed. Yup, that's where I was going with it. It's just way too strong as a single target ability but useless if it was a weaker single target ability. Making it AoE may just be what needs to be done.\n\n#E\n+ This is such a basic and good ability and somehow really iconic to him. I really don't think it should be touched.\n\n#R\n+ **Remove the Things in Bold** - \"While Nasus is empowered, he deals magic damage to all enemies around him each second, **~~capped at 240,~~** and **~~gains bonus attack damage equal to 6.375% of the damage dealt, up to a maximum of 300 bonus AD.~~**\"\n+ + They both seem so unnecessary. One removes visible power while the other grants invisible power. Take both out and it'll just make more sense.

If you drain more than the enemy can deal in damage,  then he will be a brick wall, hammering to the nexus. If he cant drain enough, he will do nothing, getting ignored.

The E is good for extra damage and armor shred on Q...but by this point in the game it is now significantly outdated as a spell. it still works and it helps, but he could use something else. I also feel as weird as this sounds, you could take his passive and move it to something that scales with an ability as a passive. Like maybe as you level up Q his life steal increases up to a flat 10 or 15% or whatever it is on his current kit and then give him a real passive that is actually useful come late game where he shines. \n\nthe one thing I think though, is that if they do rework him...he would need to still be a scaling champion who has a godly late game but weak early game. he doesn't need early game buffs because from what I can tell, his early game is something good nasus players know how to play around.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olath Quortek","date":"2015-09-25T01:44:59.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I do see Susan as the only champion that can still win the game all by himself (assuming the enemy team lets him) I do agree that he needs some love.
