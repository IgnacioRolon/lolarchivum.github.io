Let&#039;s say for arguments sake that Riot completely guts Sivir, Kalista and even Ashe. Trist and Corki still get played and would be played. Graves would come back, might even see some Lucian again who still gets picked from time to time. Maybe even see some Cancer, erm Caitlyn and then you&#039;d also see some pro as heck high level outplays from our favorite ADC Vayne. ADCs might fluctuate in power and be on a weak trend but they&#039;re never bad enough to not be absolutely mandatory. You will never see ranged ADCs eliminated from the game entirely unless something changes massively that encourage you not to do so, which will never happen.\n\nGuess what happens when Irelia and Jax get nerfed? People don&#039;t start picking olaf and Darius, the class of fighters is fucking dead. Same goes for assassins, even mages to a smal extent. This *literally never happens with ADCs and never will.* So while it&#039;s true that perhaps some ADCs could use some love, don&#039;t be a complete re-re and make the implication that they as a whole are trash. They&#039;d still get cycled through due to how mandatory they are in this game. And if you argue with me, you&#039;re wrong because I&#039;m a Nasus main and I fucking know this game.","replies":[]}
