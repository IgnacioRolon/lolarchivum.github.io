They literally put him in Poppy tier. So why can't we do the same to Nidalee? Nobody likes playing dodge a spear from fog of war. Nobody likes being burdened with trying to engage on a Nidalee comp because lol pounce and resets yay. Honestly, Nidalee has been just as big an issue in competitive play as Kassadin has yet you guys always seem to want to shove her down our throats. Nobody wants to play against this stupid champion. \n\nPlease gut her to the point her spears only do 2 damage until you can figure out how to make her design less toxic to play against.","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2015-02-25T21:00:39.325+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":4,"body":"Nobody deserves to be treated the way Kassadin has been.

I explained my reasoning. Nidalee is just as much a problem in competitive play as Kassadin has been. She's a flex pick just like he is. Theres only been short durations in competitive play since season 2 where she hasn't been pick or ban, much like Kassadin. Her gameplay is toxic as shit, do I need to explain this? Everything I've stated is backed by facts, the only difference is Kassadin got gutted and Nidalee hasn't.\n\nAre they broken for the same reason? Somewhat yes but not exactly. Riots excuse is \"well you can't hide from Kassadin so this is why we did this.\" Okay, you can't hide from Leblanc. You can't hide from Zed. You can't hide from Lissandra. You can't hide from any mobile champion who goes in, pops you and either becomes invulnerable or simply uses their mobility spell to go back out. Kassadin, unlike many of these champions, exposes himself in melee range with two of his abilities that are absolutely essential to use otherwise his damage isn't that high. \n\nWhat's the other issue? I'm sure part of it is Kassadin is harder to pin down than others but Nidalee is the exact same. So if we really focus this on their competitive strength, their versatility and their overall power, from those stand points alone, Kassadin and Nidalee can be compared. The other reasons why Kassadin is seen as an issue are abused just as much by any other [insert overly mobile champ here]. It's clear Riot hates Kassadin, I guess I can understand why. But for the life of me, why they're only butchering him and not everything that's abusing the same thing he is abusing is beyond me.\n\nI've said it before and I'll say it again: I would much rather face Kassadin than go back to dodge a spear Nidalee. I'd much rather face Kassadin, who has fairly weaker wave clear than go back to league of AFK wave clearers. At least you can seige on a Kassadin. I'd much rather deal with Kassadin than go back to league of utility Mage that CCs your team and 100-0s it at the same time. Contrary to what riot thinks, Kassadin has weaknesses and plays much the same way many other assassins do (stays on the back line then looks to clean up). Maybe he's just too good at it? I don't know, I can deal with that. What I'm not looking forward to dealing with is trying to seige on AFK wave clearers. And if Kassadins clean up is too good, just say it and I'd actually be okay with that because quite frankly it might be too good. But don't say you can't run from him, you can't run from half the champions on this roster so that's a terrible reason. \n\nRip Kassadin The LimpWalker","replies":[{"poster":"1st HanarSpectre","date":"2015-02-25T21:22:36.145+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never said I agreed with the Kassadin nerfs, in fact, I do not.

Should we rebuff his other ability now that we decided to massively nerf Riftwalk? Nah -Riot 2015.\n\nAs far as the rest, your bashing on Nidalee is still the same as the thread you were making fun of. Adding more words to it doesn't change the fact that it's the exact same post content. People make a Lee Sin thread, lists all his ability and how \"op\" they are, lists his ban/pick % and elaborates a bit on their experience then ask for the champion to be gutted so they are never seen again.

If they are in their minions, then don't gank from near your side of the lane.\n\nThird points carries a descent point, although a lot of the other really powerful junglers do have the same requirements.\n\nNidalee jungle, however, has very little in the way of a \"skill cap\". Most of the time, it's wait for a spear to land (or a team-mate's hard CC), then go cougar and mash keyboard. You can still deal pretty good damage without landing a spear, since you can still cougar and pounce in anyways.

(unless of course they push way to far in which case its thier own fault for pushing that far without ward coverage.\n\nyes im a nidalee main. but even so like i said i choose NOT to jungle with her when reksai is open becuase even though she is viable she frankly isn't as good as reksai at it. which no one seems to be complaining about anymore.\n\nand again as its been stated. nidalee hasn't changed in 5 months. she can now deal more damage to jungle creep allowing her to jungle. \nthis has ZERO impact in the damage she does vs players.\n\nthe only differernce is nidalee can finally do what she should have been able to do since her release.. jungle. becuase lets face it.. she is FROM the freaking jungle. the fact that it took them this long to make her viable in the jungle is what amazes me.\n\nas my closing argument im going to say this.\nnidalee has been the same for 5 months.\nif you really think she is now \"OP\" vs yourself and other players becuase her damage vs jungle minions has increase with absolutely no changes to anything else. then what are you really complaining about?\n\nher damage HAS NOT CHANGED, it hasn't in 5 months.\n\nyour trying to tell me they need to nerf the damage of a skill. or the range of a skill or ANYTHING. becuase why?\n\nany argument that calls a nerf for an overall nerf to a skill becuase the skill does more damage to JUNGLE mobs, has no basis for argument.\n\n(unless your a jungle mob... then you can complain...)","replies":[{"poster":"Dyonas","date":"2015-02-26T01:44:27.405+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SwiftKitten88,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=p07RNOie,comment-id=000200010000,timestamp=2015-02-25T20:41:18.096+0000)\n> \n> and again as its been stated. nidalee hasn't changed in 5 months. she can now deal more damage to jungle creep allowing her to jungle. \n> this has ZERO impact in the damage she does vs players.\n> \n> the only differernce is nidalee can finally do what she should have been able to do since her release.. jungle. becuase lets face it.. she is FROM the freaking jungle. the fact that it took them this long to make her viable in the jungle is what amazes me.\n> \n> as my closing argument im going to say this.\n> nidalee has been the same for 5 months.\n> if you really think she is now \"OP\" vs yourself and other players becuase her damage vs jungle minions has increase with absolutely no changes to anything else. then what are you really complaining about?\n> \n> her damage HAS NOT CHANGED, it hasn't in 5 months.\n> \n> your trying to tell me they need to nerf the damage of a skill. or the range of a skill or ANYTHING. becuase why?\n> \n> any argument that calls a nerf for an overall nerf to a skill becuase the skill does more damage to JUNGLE mobs, has no basis for argument.\n> \n> (unless your a jungle mob... then you can complain...)\n\nThe funny thing is Kassadin didn't change but they gave him -10 to his Q. Then the 450 ult. All the previous nerfs too. The only change was to make him weaker and weaker yet they still pushed through this ludicrous ult change. You say Nidalee hasn't changed in 5 months but the same is said of a lot of champions. You're safe though. They'll nerf Kassadin again before anything happens to Nidalee.\n\nBefore this last change people were saying it isn't necessary (those with somewhat sensible views, like Scarra) and the only thing that has changed is he was used as a flex pick. His power got weaker but because he could play in a few positions now that was reason enough. Nidalee used to be top and now she's gone jungle so that's two positions. She could easily be lined up for nerfs but again, not Kassadin so you're likely safe for a while.","replies":[{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2015-02-26T04:31:39.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"first off your wrong in a few things... nidalee was never only top. infact the only time i ever played her top was after the rework but before the AD nerfs.. almost every top lane tanky bruiser counters her top lane. picking her top in the current meta is in her current state is almost asking to lose unless the pick one of the few top laners she can beat like {{champion:8}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:75}} \n\nnidalee right now is a mid lane assasin who can as of her most recent patch jungle as well. \n\nas for the lastest nerf to kassadin... yeah thi nerf his ulti range.. not sure if it was needed, maybe it was, maybe it wasn't.. but at lvl 16 it had a 3 second cooldown. so i would have to say a 700 mobilty range skill on a 3 second cooldown is pretty strong. for any character. and they lowered the mana cost of it.","replies":[{"poster":"Dyonas","date":"2015-02-26T05:40:04.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't say she was only top.

Lack of vision? You Rift Walk the wrong way out of two and they get away. You can't chase endlessly because of the mana cost and if you don't have vision it's just asking for death. It doesn't make it an instant win button as so many believe either. There are plenty of other champions that can chase you down but he was the best at it in some situations.\n\nSomething else I seem to be saying a lot. Just because he could chase someone down and do some decent damage late game or when fed hard doesn't mean he's overpowered. ADCs can kill you in 3 basic attacks if you're not a tank and even tanks die pretty fast.
