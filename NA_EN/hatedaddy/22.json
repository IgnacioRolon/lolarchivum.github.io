As a means to bring the god of doge back down to earth some, we've got a slight nerf in mind: wither now has 150 range and increases the enemies attack speed.

It has become much more lively and the Nasus discussion is pretty good. When I first joined the sub, it was pretty inactive. But a lot of players started playing again over the last couple months and Angormus posts their pretty regularly.  \n\nI shifted from posting here about Nasus to mostly posting there or summoner school. I think the discussion is just a lot better and there and the people are simply friendly. \n\nI think the Nasus discussion on the league forums in general, has always been reduced to low Elo players thinking he is OP and complaining, and high elo players complaining that he sucks. Anyways check it out sometime.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rexxiee","date":"2017-07-28T02:33:08.105+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Only problem is how ridiculous he is at lvl 9 regardless if hes feeding or not.\n\nRank 1 ult should absolutely not give him a sub 1s cd Q.","replies":[{"poster":"LyingOnLine","date":"2017-07-28T03:08:45.307+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Fortunately for you, it doesn't.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Terror13","date":"2017-08-15T15:01:18.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rexxiee,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ITOGcEo6,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2017-07-28T02:33:08.105+0000)\n>\n> Only problem is how ridiculous he is at lvl 9 regardless if hes feeding or not.\n> \n> Rank 1 ult should absolutely not give him a sub 1s cd Q.\n\nIt doesn't, if you have max CDR it gives 1.2 sec, ontop of it.\n\nAnd seeing as msot champs in this game can insta kill you with a mix of ability combo, yet nasus if he doesn't do 100% dmg with one Q hes gotta wait a whole 4 to 2.4 seconds to then hit again, he doesn't really \"one shot\" this is a buff hes needed for a LONG time.\n\nBecause whilst nasus looks good on paper, he actually ends up being one of the lowest dps chars in the game, even with like 700 stacks, because if you don't 1 shot em with old nasus, there is a high chance you wont get another chance to Q unless it's a 1v1 with a low mobiltiy champ with not much cc.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hexs Fortune","date":"2017-07-28T15:38:03.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nasus needed some love","replies":[]},{"poster":"LadyRenly","date":"2017-07-27T23:22:00.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I freaking love new nasus, his ult has been offered a bit more respect.
