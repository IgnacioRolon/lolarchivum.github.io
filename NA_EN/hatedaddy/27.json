But the fact of the matter is, they do his job and do it significantly better than he does for a few reasons.\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s start with Vi:\r\n\r\nShe has more durability\r\nMore upfront damage and good sustained damage, not to mention utility in the form of armor shred\r\nBetter ganking at basically all points of the game\r\nBetter clear in the jungle\r\nFunctions better as a bruiser/off-tank (keep in mind whenever nocturne has been played competitively, he&#039;s been built basically full tank + botrk)\r\nArguably, she scales better than Nocturne \r\n\r\nWith Rengar, there&#039;s not a lot to say. Rengar is just a better version of nocturne when you build both to do damage, whereas Vi is better as a bruiser/off-tank and more reliable overall. \r\n\r\nNocturne needs changes and I&#039;m not sure buffing numbers changes much, unless you just overtune the crap out of him, which is not the way to go. He needs his role to be differentiated somehow. Paranoia is his bread and butter as a champion and the spell has a lot of power in it, given that it denies vision ontop of instant dive. But the fact remains he can seldom use the power of his dive. Obviously his E has a delay on it due to the simple fact it would be kind of silly if he could ult from such a range and instantly stun somebody, but Vi does this from a pretty respectable range, too. Minus the semi global range obviously. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m not really sure what the answers are, but nocturne just kinda seems lackluster compared to those two. His spell shield is also a pretty weak defensive tool. And his base defensive stats are not good. And his passive is honestly kind of bleh.\r\n\r\nI know sated devourer does help him some and is good on him but at it&#039;s core, it doesn&#039;t solve any of his problems.

His playstyle is one of THE most unique in this game, he takes some skill to play since he doesn't have what one could call \"traditional ganking tools\", at least not untill he gets level 6 and unlocks his ultimate. And that's a problem. You are not mastering a champion based on their kit and its involvement around every possible situation, you're adjusting your playstyle to a champion that's lacking. You learn to play by being crippled from the start, instead of working your way up, not to mention there is no clear emphasis on counterpicking with or against him. Sadly, his fucking awesome eternum skin and great thematic are suffering because of it :/ .\n\nMy honest opinion is that he does indeed need a kit rework, not just buffs.\nOn top of my head, here are a couple of suggestions, with the notion of him being a jungler that comes from far away inside the jungle to assasinate a single target by ravaging him with abilities as well as basic attacks.\n\n-Still builds AD. Now has a new passive. For the sake of doubt, let's name it \"nocnoc, who's there\". His basic attacks apply a debuf, that when consumed, give each of his abilities a special effect. Doesn't stack with itself, meaning you apply it, proc it with a spell, re-apply it, then proc it again. Could be instant, or with a very short cooldown if deemed overly excessive/oppressive when used on the same target(assassin or not, balance above all else). Kinda like Nautilus's passive but in a shorter cooldown so as to make sense with the rest of the kit. It can be applied on several enemies at a time.\n\n-Remove his old passive. Turn it into his Q. Now he has a small AoE cleave spell ala Zed/Hecarim, that does physical damage. If it consumes \"nocnoc, who's there\" it does increased physical damage, to keep the identity of his \"periodically enhanced basic attacks\" since his Q is on a fairly low coodlown to be spammable and his main source of jungle clear.\n\n-Remove his E, put it into his W as his secondary spell. Same effect as before, tether an enemy for magic damage, at the end fear them if the connection isn't     broken. If it consumes \"nocnoc, who's there\" it absorbes the target's health in a similar manner as Fiddlesticks's W, healing Nocturne for the duration. It's now his new form of sustain.\n\n-His new E now is a projectile that works and feels like his old Q but with possibly a tad narrower hitbox. It's now his only ganking tool untill he gets level 6. Nocturne releases black haze that passes through all enemies hit dealing a rather small amount of damage. Why? Because this is now his only ganking tool before level 6. When the haze hits an enemy champion it dissolves dealing damage and slowing them. The longer it travels, the more its damage falls off but the greater the slow gets. As an incentive for players to land long range skillshots instead of free poke damage, they are rewarded with a very strong slow. It stops at the first champion hit. If it procs \"nocnoc, who's there\" it stuns instead of slowing, for a duration that's up for discussion.\n\n-His ultimate can stay the same. But it does last a little bit longer, to emphasize the fear of drowning in darkness and isolation. With perhaps lesser cooldown, or maybe it gets its cooldown partialy lowered if you kill an enemy shortly after using it. But I have this idea: turn it into the exact opposite of TF's ult. Now it is global, Nocturne can jump to any enemy champion he wishes and could perhaps deal no damage to allocate powerbudget to the rest of his kit, to counteract his now global presense. Both of my iterations now apply \"nocnoc, who's there\" to all enemy champions.\n\n\nVery sorry for the wall of text :( it's all ogre now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"g07h4xf00","date":"2015-08-18T17:32:24.975+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"That's because {{champion:56}} ultimate got nerfed to shit so of course he's going to feel mediocre.

Nocturne ults onto a target, what happens? He has to have his E fear them, giving them opportunity to flash out entirely like it never happened and if they have mobility, good luck.

So in his niche, he's not bad. But overall in general, he's outclassed. The question becomes this: do you want him to stay in his niche and likely never get nerfs but never really get buffed either? Or would you rather have him changed up a little to give him more general power, take away from his niche some and just introduce him to the game as a general pick that isn't so outclassed by others? In truth, neither answer is wrong. I'd just much prefer to see him transformed more into a fighter that excels at being in the middle of a team, rather than a global vision denying assassin that needs assistance to exist properly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bisaknosp","date":"2015-08-18T20:10:11.519+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"with the devourer item i would say he is equally strong or maybe stronger","replies":[{"poster":"HateDaddy","date":"2015-08-18T20:17:10.710+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fantomumenasu,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HsfkWA4z,comment-id=000f,timestamp=2015-08-18T20:10:11.519+0000)\n>\n> with the devourer item i would say he is equally strong or maybe stronger\n\nhe's really not","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dr Poro","date":"2015-08-18T19:37:03.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I see no reason to play Vi when Devourer exists.\n\nBtw, nocturne has a better winrate and performance than Vi.

Vi sits at 50% with a pickrate of 10%, that actually suggests vi is significantly better. 3% pickrate is basically just nocturne mains winning 51% of their games, whereas 10% is more along the lines of your average joe just picking up Vi, playing her and winning. 1% difference in winrate hardly means much on its own but when you consider the 7% difference in pickrate, it's telling you how much more reliable and consistent Vi is compared to Nocturne.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2015-08-18T21:01:43.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually think Devourer Vi would be fun :3","replies":[{"poster":"CZNOuI9LIw","date":"2015-08-19T02:08:06.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is.
