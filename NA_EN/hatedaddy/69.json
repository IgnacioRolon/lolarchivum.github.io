And because they&#039;re playing tanks, wave management and the likes don&#039;t matter because they can setup ganks easily and still do an enormous amount of damage. \r\n\r\nYou&#039;re still forced to take teleport if you want to be relevant \r\n\r\nDamage dealing top laners aren&#039;t good, you can&#039;t build damage because you just get insta cc&#039;d and die because tenacity is still garbage and chain CCING is too easy now because everything gets 40% CDR. \r\n\r\nTop lane has always had questionable diversity but this is so bad right now that playing anything non meta gets you an instant loss. Outplaying and out thinking/outlasting your opponent isn&#039;t a thing because of corrupting potion/grasp/TP. Lane aggression isn&#039;t a thing because it&#039;s pointless. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m glad Irelia is happy about these trinity changes but even Jax is still complete garbage because he doesnt have a &quot;you can&#039;t cc me&quot;passive. Carry tops are dead, tanks and mages are the only things you&#039;re allowed to play now. \r\n\r\nTenacity needs to be better, tanks need to do less damage. Grasp needs to be reworked. Cc stacking needs to be remade somehow, everything has hard CC now and because every class basically can buy 40% CDR now in their core items, that problem is worse since spells are more spammable than ever.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-06-07T22:10:07.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a side note, grasp is probably the worst thing to happen to top lane IMO.  Sure I like using it but it clearly needs to be either drastically changed or removed as it messes with too many champions power levels especially in the early/mid game where sustain can be kind in lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-06-07T22:07:56.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I do admit top lane this season had a rocky start with every assassin you could think of trying out their brand new tank builds (looking at you akali, ekko, fiora, yasou, fizz). Now we only have two problems (IMO), vladimir and swain.  Unfortunately neither of their reworks gave them meaningful weaknesses and we are left with horrible laning phases for the opponent.\n\nOn the other hand once I ban those two them im usually set to have a good time top lane.  All of the champs I play (Darius, Renekton, Illaoi, jax, Irelia)  have all recently come back in strengh (woot my boy jax is back and is for once balanced, shame irelia got overtuned). \n\nI like the aspect of how trading and wave management currently works in top lane and with the new dragons and rift herald I feel way more as a member of the team helping to win while still holding that feeling of 1v1 skill on an island alone splitpushing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MISTAFUNKTASTIC","date":"2016-06-07T21:25:21.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMO {{champion:36}} is always fun. :)  \n\nTo add something legitimate to the conversation, keystone masteries are way to powerful in general.
