He has a 20% damage reduction that cannot be penned through. At 100 armour after pen Maokai effectively has 150 armour due to his ultimate. This isn't true for most tanks.

So many spells ignore this damage reduction, auto attacks included obviously.~~ Maokai is a very strong tank, I've never denied this. So is Nautilus, so is poppy, even Shen is seeing some play again. \n\nEdit: I want to clarify that I was wrong about my initial statement. It seems maokais ult actually totally reduces all non turret damage now, this was a change over from his old ult which only reduced AoE damage. Nevertheless, this doesn't change much because almost every true innate tank has a massive defensive steroid in their kit whether it be in the form of percentage damage reduction, shields or massive regen. \n\n> Most tanks don&#x27;t get this.

Some tanks are strong, some aren't but there's plenty of viable tanks right now to suggest tanks are fine. I'm totally not against the idea of buffing underperforming tanks. I'm just calling bullshit when I see outrageous statements that aren't true, one obviously being tanks instadying and the other being tanks suck.\n\n> Looking down your profile, you lose a lot of games (well over 50% chance) as Nasus, Jax and Malphite vs lethality on this patch.

Most of my losses come from flex queue, where I don't really give a shit if we win or lose because I'm typically just playing with friends.

But many of these \"ADCs\" don't really function as bot lane ADCs anymore. Graves and Quinn in particular are great examples of this. Graves is fucking stupid, so we likely agree on this. And as much as I hate Quinn, she does have her drawbacks. But these two don't really function in the ADC role anymore so we should be careful labeling them as such because they tend to function closer to assassins/bruisers than ADCs and should probably be balanced with a flavor of that element. \n\n> And I am being reasonable, full AD comps should suffer.

Due to the state of lethality currently it is possible for a couple of assassins when used together to kill a tank in half a second though, I'm pretty sure that a Talon and a Rengar with lethality builds + a LDR can instantly kill a tank if they jump on them at the same time which really needs to not be a thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Leonerdo","date":"2017-02-15T03:28:05.984+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Aight, my formula is a little forgiving, yours is the opposite, so I'll use what the folks over on the Wiki used for their example on [this page](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Armor_penetration), which is halfway between our formulas.\n\n(((250\\*.55) + 100)\\*.7\\*.93 - 59 = 95.6 armor.

With this build and the 24 lethality page + 18/12/0 sec she has 310 bonus AD for 373 total AD. She also has 59 lethality.\n> \n> Let&#x27;s start by working out what our 540 Rammus&#x27;s armour will be VS this, Rammus has a base armour of 104. That means the calc for the pen are (540x.7)x.093-(540-104)x0.45-59=96 total armour. With 96 armour Rammus has 1.96x as much EHP as HP, so 7.84k EHP VS the MF.\n> \n> Now the question is how much damage does MFs ult do? MFs Ult has 16 waves at 75% total AD scaling+3 for AP from masteries, that&#x27;s a total of 283 per wave, or 4524 total damage, this is multiplied by 1.15 by LDR and 1.05 by DeS, for a total of 5463 raw damage, around two thirds of a full tank Rammus&#x27;s HP.\n> \n> So Rammus won&#x27;t literally die to an MF ult, although if anything else hits him in the duration he probably will die since it&#x27;s dealing over half of his HP. If you sub in most other tanks and don&#x27;t give 540 armour (which most tanks don&#x27;t have the luxury of) they drop to under 500 from just an MF ult.\n> \n> Let me quickly get the numbers for a 350 armour 100 base armour tank, more in the range of sanity for most champs. At 350 armour that equation becomes (350x.7)x.093-(350-100)x0.45-59=56, they only have 6.24k with the same 4K HP. That Bullet time is now so close to killing them that an extra AA from the MF will probably do it.\n> \n> This is what pen is doing to tanks right now, it&#x27;s knocking off so much armour that they just fail at their job of tanking.\n\nWell, that is calculated incorrectly. I was hoping you'd have gotten it right so I wouldn't have to do this, But...\n\nFirst, we have to consider that Black Cleaver takes six rounds of MF ult to achieve full percentage reduction, so we'll calculate it wave by wave until that point is reached.\n\nAnd pretty much everything except the lethality will be multiplicatively stacking with LDR, not additively as it seems to be in your calculations which is big.\n\nThe formula  for effective armor is... [((1 - 0.05t) 104) x 0.93)] + [((1-0.05t) 436) x 0.55 x 0.93)] - 59 where t is stacks of black cleaver, up to 6.\n\nSo calculating the effective armor on hit value for the first 7 waves and damage, we get:\n\nFormula: \n\n(100 x 1.15 x 1.02 x 276.5) / (100 + Eff. Armor)\n\n1. 260.73 >> 92.55\n2. 244.75 >> 96.85\n3. 228.76 >> 101.55\n4. 212.77 >> 106.75\n5. 196.79 >> 112.5\n6. 180.8 >> 118.9 \n7++. 164.81 >> 126.08\n\nTotal damage: ~1889.9\n\nFull build rammus typically has at least 4k health. If you itemized full armor, that's health from randuins, sunfire, deadman's, hell throw in a warmogs and you're nearing 5k.\n\nSo, in conclusion, 540 armor rammus will lose at most SLIGHTLY near half of his health at most to a fully channeled MF ulti. This is entirely theoretical, and would probably never actually happen in a real game. I did this calculation in about an hour because I'm really inefficient at this, but I didn't want people to have the wrong idea about how strong lethality + armor pen is. For everyone who upvoted that original post, I suggest go look on the LoL wiki to learn more about how this stuff is actually calculated.

If you itemized full armor, that's health from randuins, sunfire, deadman's, hell throw in a warmogs and you're nearing 5k.\n\nIf you itemise that you don't have 540 armour, you'd end taking more damage even though you have more HP, the difference wouldn't be huge.
