Many assassins have skill shots just like some of these mages but even if they don&#039;t, they have to jump into the middle of a team to do damage and damage is all they bring to the table. Meanwhile, mages still bring ridiculous waveclear and utility to a team and scale much better overall.\r\n\r\nI just don&#039;t understand the logic when killing you quickly is what assassins are designed to do but now it&#039;s a problem but yet this same problem applies to several mages while the level of gameplay is basically identical (limited counterplay) yet it&#039;s not a problem.

Fewer than 0.5 seconds from engagement is a more realistic complaint. On average, mages kill people in 3 seconds after using their skills. On average, assassins kill much quicker. There is a very, very noticeable difference in the burst period of the average members of each class.\n\nSecond, assassins bring the mobility needed to make their ability to instantly delete people reliable to the point of not caring who else is around the target, and to then get away from an overextension without being in real risk. Mages are way more vulnerable than assassins to getting frontlined out of being able to do their job.","replies":[{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2016-10-16T23:34:57.085+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":11,"body":"That's not even close to being true.  The only assassins with reliable escapes are Zed and Leblanc.  Every other Assassin is stuck dead center right in the middle of your team when they go in on a target.  The reason assassins need that mobility is to get to the target in the first place because all of them are melee excluding leblanc.  Mages, on the other hand, have long range spells or tons of cc (or both) and some even have good mobility to top that off which makes them much harder to kill when they go in on a team.  Not to mention they have the best itemization in the game so they can go full glass cannon while being tanky at the same time.  Assassins do not have that luxury.  Mages also aren't completely destroyed by exhaust and supports facerolling their keyboards because of all of the utility they bring with them so even if they don't kill their target they still bring a ton of CC to help out their team whereas assassins cannot do that.\n\nPeople talk about lack of counterplay for Assassins, but then you got Anivia, Annie, Kennen, Lissandra, Orianna, and friends doing comparable damage but this time cc locking you so you can't do anything about their burst while being able to do it safely from range.  At least with Assassins you can use your mobility spells or flash to get away.  Mages just keep you in the same spot and kill you before their CC duration has ended.\n\nEdit: If you want an example here it is.  Diving a Varus like that as a melee Assassin would've been suicide, but Syndra safely killed him from range because of her high damage and stupid hitbox stun.  This is at level 6 with 2 dorans rings.  He even cleansed the stun and he still died lol.  If an assassin had done that then there would be massive outcry for nerfs, but Syndra is a mage so it was just a super outplay.\n\nhttps://puu.sh/rtGsz/036452778d.webm","replies":[{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2016-10-17T02:00:06.216+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":5,"body":">At least with Assassins you can use your mobility spells or flash to get away.\n\nlolakali\n\nSyndra also isn't the best example as people are realizing she needs some nerfs during these Worlds.

Mages aren't supposed to get access to the backline if the teams are even slightly coherent. Assassins can pretty much target adcs exclusively.

She doesnt want to waste her ult on a j4 or Gragas, and they can make it really dangerous for her to reach a better target.\n\nEven with flash and protobelt, mages can be kept in check if the squishies have some sense. Assassins don't have this problem, they will basically always reach the backline and they have to be directly peeled and killed as they reach the squishies.
