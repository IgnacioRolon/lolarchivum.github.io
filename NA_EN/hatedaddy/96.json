She has no sustain, unlike Yasuo who has his basic Q up more often then Ahri's maxed W, her lowest CD ability. Not to mention that Yasuo's Q can still get a CD lowering with extra attack speed. And speaking of cooldowns, Yasuo's W is the only ability with a decently high cooldown, which is completely earned with how good it is. His ult, at max level, has a 30 second cooldown. Ahri's ult, on the other hand, has a max level cooldown of 80 seconds. \"Well Ahri's ult is far better!\" you may say, but Yasuo's ult lets him ignore 50% of bonus armor for 15 seconds. And his ult still does a ton of base damage without the shred. So basically, Ahri can pick off one person, while Yasuo can fly around in a fight zapping and attacking and generally being a nuisance.","replies":[{"poster":"Serevas","date":"2015-09-01T15:10:14.968+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're comparing the base cooldowns of someone who doesn't build any CDR to the base cooldowns of someone who builds at minimum 25% CDR, it's not even a proper comparison.\n\nFurthermore you seem to be lacking the concept of what \"sustain\" actually is. Her passive heals her for a shit load in lane, there's a major difference between \"sustain\" and \"sustained damage\".\n\nWhat does Ahri do after her EQWR? R twice more, then W Q again, as the cooldowns are already up. The only ability that Yasuo can use frequently is his Q, as the on hit cooldown of E is at minimum 6 seconds, his Ultimate requires the target to be knocked up to use, and his wind wall has a long CD and deals no damage. So Yasuo basically has one ability after he's dashed on you. % armor shred is only really useful against tanks because 50% of 30 is still only 15 armor.\n\nOh and I almost forgot, Ahri doesn't do damage to a single target, 2 of her abilities can hit multiple people, her W technically can as well, she has a ton of AoE damage, a lot of it being true damage return on Q, true damage that accounts for roughly 26% of her damage in a typical game mind you.\n\nFor Yasuo to be truly super threatening a team has to be built around him, Ahri can be picked into literally any composition and function properly because her abilities have zero conditions to them. \n\nI still maintain that I would prefer to play against a Yasuo anytime over an Ahri.

Does that make any of them OP?\n\nI meant sustained damage in fights. If it came across as meaning sustain in lane, then I was incorrectly explaining myself. \n\nYasuo has a knockup in his kit. That's why his ult requires enemies to be knocked up. Many champions also have the ability to knock things up or away for him. Many top supports (Alistar, Braum, Janna, Thresh) have the ability to knock up.

Corki's true damage is maybe 34 per auto attack and that's only when he's nearing full build.\n\nTwitch's true damage at level 17 is out damaged by ignite at level 9, it's practically nonexistent, let alone having to actually apply all 6 stacks? You're probably dead by that time unless you've got some really good peel.\n\nOlaf's true damage costs his own health if he doesn't kill the target.\n\nDarius and Cho'gath's true damage are both their ultimate abilities, Darius' has a lengthy cooldown if you fail to kill. Not to mention that Ahri's Q out damages Darius' rank 1 ultimate with only half the ability. The full damage also outdoing the stacked damage.\n\nThere are meaningful trade offs to each of the other champions true damage, or it's weak by comparison, Ahri actually receives a benefit for utilizing hers in the form of 215-80 movement speed, which only makes her combo that much easier to hit, or a gank that much easier to get away from. That's more movement speed than any pair of boots aside from boots of mobility, and boots of swiftness with Alacrity match the degraded movement speed. She genuinely has the most unconditional mobility in the entire game, until Riven hits 40% CDR, and Riven's mobility is only more if the player knows how to balance the cooldowns on Broken Wings.\n\nI just find it interesting how you'd rather play against a champion that braindead roflstomps soloqueue without any effort, compared to a champion that actually requires a lot of practice to play properly and is also super easy to deal with if you have any comprehension of how the champion functions.

Holy crap all my damage does actual damage now.\" That's what my complaint is, Ahri has no simple and easy counter play that always works, Yasuo does. Yasuo's power is traded off for having simple, easy, always relevant, counter play. Ahri has zero trade offs for all of the power in her kit, except for the fact that it costs mana, and keep in mind her mana costs are pathetically low as is anyway.\n\nWhat's Ahri's counter play?

If you want to continue the ad hominem form of arguments please continue, but you clearly are talking yourself in circles and simply attacking the arguer rather than the arguments any longer, so this is a complete waste of time, so I'll leave you with the below information.\n\nYasuo's win rate against common mid lane champions:\n\nAnnie: 39.15%\nAnivia: 45.18%\nXerath: 46.5%\nTalon: 44.42%\nLeBlanc: 49.14%\nKatarina: 48.51%\nCho'Gath: 45.38%\nViktor: 49.26%\nZed: 49.49%\nLissandra: 45.91%\nAhri: 47.46% (My mistake, her win rate against him is 52.54%, that wind wall sure does shut Ahri down hard.)\nFizz: 50.26%\nDiana: 49.64%\nTwisted Fate: 49.48%\nOrianna: 53.01%\n\nOnly one match up that you would typically encounter with a severe difference to his benefit, as .26% advantage is basically going even in my book.","replies":[{"poster":"KatCraft","date":"2015-09-02T04:26:35.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've been playing this game for three years. Looking at my recent match history is going to tell you nothing mate lmao. You know why I played Yasuo against bots? Because I felt like playing something brainless but didn't want to play that toxic shit against another player.\n\nYou can juke and dodge skillshots. You can't make Yasuo miss his windwall or outplay a passive shield. There's a significant difference. You know how to play against Ahri in lane? Stand behind minions making her charm worthless, and not stand still like a mindless idiot. If you think there is no counter play to Ahri I don't know what to tell you. \n\nHaha Your own advise to dealing with Yasuo is be near your minion wave, how else are you supposed to aa his shield off? You aren't consistent. How can you tell me he isn't safe when even you say you can't go near your own minion wave? \n\nAlso I find it really weird you trying to question my judgement when you are in the lowest rank in this game with less than 200 games played. League of legends is the only game I see this, in Starcraft this doesn't happen. Really strange. \n\nI am not talking about game winrates, or that he is overpowered. If you clearly read my post I said his laning is oppressive. I already stated Yasuo is not broken in that he is team comp orientated and most players in solo Q won't build a team around him and Yasuo players will usually lock him into a game regardless of how bad the pick is. Unless Yasuo is disgustingly fed, he needs multiple sources of knock up and tanking in a team fight or else he is useless. \n\nYasuo also dies to ganks easily. The one counter to him you did not bother to mention or realise is If you have a good jungler and if he wants to camp your lane, THEN Yasuo is an easy target. But there will be games where your jungler has to help somebody else. There will be games were the Yasuo was picked into a good team comp. Those games are nightmare fuel. \n\nYou should realise that winrates and games are not determined by who the best champs in lane are.","replies":[{"poster":"Serevas","date":"2015-09-02T14:07:39.183+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tell you what. I'll play nothing, but ranked for a week, and since I gain upwards of 30lp per win, maybe then you can look at my rank. I don't play much ranked because the toxic assholes in bronze, who apparently inhabit OCE as well, are rampant within the division. There's 4 types of people in bronze. The people with a massively unstable internet connection that result in continuous disconnections and 4v5 games for their teams. The people who jumped straight into ranked without even having a proper page of t3 runes. The people who rage endlessly at their team for their own mistakes, blaming everything that happens in the game on someone else. And finally the people who the \"*soft reset*\" dumped them out of silver and into bronze to deal with the other 3 groups of people, which they got tired of doing and stopped playing ranked all together.\n\nI didn't say there's no counter play to Ahri, the counter play to Ahri is also simple, but all it does is make her push you into tower unless you have enough waveclear to deal with the fact that she heals all of the harass you give her back simply by pushing the wave. \n\nYou know how else you AA his shield off? Not brainlessly walking up the center of the lane, there are other parts of the lane to stand in that aren't right on top of your minions. If you can't understand that, you haven't learned a thing in your three years of playing. It's also pretty simple to understand when you can move forward, like idk, not when his tornado is up. The counter play to Yasuo is so brain dead obvious that anyone who doesn't get it shouldn't step outside of bot matches. No counter play to a passive shield lmfao, if that were true the shield would be constant, never deteriorate, never break, and never need to charge up.\n\nI didn't mention the ganking counter because that's not consistent, it relies on another person, the entire focus of my argument is consistent, always true counterplay, which you would understand if you actually had some reading comprehension.\n\nYou're right in that win rates aren't determined exclusively by who does better in lane, however, there is something to be said when a champions sits above 52% against each champion match up. There might just be a common denominator involved in that equation, but what do I know I'm a lower rank than you.\n\nIt's just weird that you sit here and tell me he's super safe in lane through his dashes, then tell me he's super vulnerable to everything. Please pick a side, arguing both sides is a waste of time for us both. In fact I'm realizing this entire argument is a waste of time in the first place, you're very stuck in the rank means everything, and clearly it's impossible that a lower rank can have any understanding of the game at all mentality. I was going to go into this big thing about how your ranked MMR is in the toilet and is equivalent to my MMR in normals, but just knowing you're dropping out of the rank with which your arguments to heavily hinge on, while I'm climbing is enough satisfaction for me, and I'll leave you with this last tidbit.\n\nI'm just curious, why do you think it is that pro teams employ coaches and analysts that are lower ranks than their players? Clearly the players can't have anything of value to gain from these people are they're higher ranked so they must know much better than each of these people, just seems like a waste of money when you look at it with that approach, but that's just me.\n\nI'm actually done replying to this now, because it's just a waste of time to argue a point with people like you in this game. So you have a good one.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Malix Farwin","date":"2015-09-01T18:19:40.771+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lets nerf {{champion:40}}  and {{champion:53}}  with similar stats as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xela Syab","date":"2015-09-01T14:50:29.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yas clears waves and has an execute.

Secondly if you think Anivia, Brand, and Swain need buffs idk what to say. Karhus is meant to be a late game god, and lux just got more buffs. I cant think of any \"wonky\" mechanics in any of the champions you just mentioned. Lux is a cc bot with high burst damage. Anivia is a tanky monstrosity with zone control and situational burst. Galio is a situational pick into majority mage comps that is meant to be able to tank and dish out high damage for a tank or mage. Swain is a thick sustained damage mage with a snare and a slow and a damage amplifier. Karthus has less crowd control and requires positioning like an adc because of howfragile he is and once he does die he unloads massive ult damage on this killers.
