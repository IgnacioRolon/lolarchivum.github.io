This Monday we&#039;re kicking off coverage of our VFX and SFX updates with Renekton.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the [recent Jarvan, Lee Sin, Veigar, and Vi updates](https://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/client-new-features-feedback/J8p5dlpl-visual-effect-and-sound-effect-updates-to-jarvan-lee-sin-veigar-and-vi), we&#039;re working on VFX and SFX updates to more champions whose spell effects are in need of some love to get to current League standards and improve gameplay readability. In Patch 8.24, we&#039;ll be releasing updates for Anivia, Dr. Mundo, Gragas (VFX only; SFX shipped in patch 8.21), and Teemo. Keep an eye on this post and we&#039;ll add visual previews as they become ready! Please try them out on the PBE&mdash;especially if you&#039;re a main&mdash;when they&#039;re in and leave us your feedback here!\r\n\r\nToday&#039;s post focuses on the _visual effects_ for Renekton. Please note that he **will** be receiving some _sound effects_ updates as well, but they are not included in this preview.\r\n\r\n#Renekton\r\nPassive - Glowing hand VFX are more clear, and his eyes glow red to match the ability icon\r\nBA - Updated impact FX\r\nQ - Now has some effects to show the range. Note that when Renekton is in his Ultimate form, the effects scale up to match the increased size of the hitbox (and yes, it really is that big when he has ulted!)\r\nW - Mostly unchanged\r\nE - Cleaned up VFX with some sand for more satisfaction. Much clearer VFX when he uses his passive empowered Dice for gameplay readability\r\nR - New Transformation effects with a swirling sandstorm around him, with a clearer range indicator. Flying dragonflies are now swarming scarab beetles.\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/2Svl4NOaCdE\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of Renekton&#039;s skins have been updated to use these new VFX.\r\n\r\nCertain skins have some recolored VFX:\r\n\r\nGalactic - Recolored Ult\r\nBloodfury - Recolored Ult\r\nOutback - Same as base\r\nRune Wars - Slightly updated Ult, with a new unique decal\r\nScorched Earth - Slightly updated Ult to make range clearer\r\nPool Party - Slightly updated Ult to make range clearer. Q uses updated VFX, but recolored green for unempowered version\r\nPrehistoric - Same as base\r\nSKT T1 - Recolored ult, with a new unique decal featuring the SKT logo. Q and E use updated VFX, but recolored blue for unempowered version. \r\nRenektoy - Changed to use Base&#039;s updated VFX\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/T8OEFuQ","replies":[{"poster":"Lord SideShift","date":"2018-11-06T01:06:30.415+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hello, I'm currently a Renekton OTP and overall I'd say the changes are good here.\nSome desired feedback:\n\nOutback Renekton: Should have the same ult visual color as Galactic. The blue skin would look much better with a blue appropriate ult.\n\nRenektoy: I understand the complaint for a 750 skin not receiving much love, as for the price point it should not. But take in mind that this skin has many chroma's and is widely used often in my own experience. That being said I think a recolor of the ult should be fine...Green? Hopefully that won't cost you much effort or time.\n\nBloodfury Renekton: I don't think the outline of ult should be different than the red he receives inside his ult transformation. My only worry here is that it will look visually close to Rune Wars, in which case Rune Wars should stand out more as it's his most insane looking ult on live.\n\nBesides that Riot Beardilocks you have done a great job overall and should feel quite proud of yourself. Please make sure he keeps all of his animation cancels and W last hitting minions mechanics in tact. Losing those would be a actual gameplay nerf.\n\nI hope this feedback helps (:","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Beardilocks","date":"2018-11-06T02:52:40.188+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a lot for your feedback and suggestions :)\n\nPlease note that none of his gameplay or animations is changing in any way, so his cancels and last hits should all be fine","replies":[{"poster":"Lord SideShift","date":"2018-11-06T03:12:09.847+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"No Problem!

As a 750 skin, he shouldn't really have any unique or recolored VFX. When he was revealed on PBE he had some nuts and bolts in his ult, and he used the spinning water VFX from Pool Party, as the team that worked on him felt that the base VFX were too old and noisy. They subsequently removed the nuts and bolts before releasing him, as they didn't make that much sense (he's a plastic toy, not a metal robot), so he launched with just blue water VFX.\n\nNow that I've updated the base VFX to be less noisy, it makes sense to me to revert him to using the sandy base VFX. However, if Renekton players feel very strongly that he should use the watery VFX that he launched with, I'm open to doing that instead. Alternatively, if anyone has any really awesome ideas for his ult (preferably similar to what the other ults look like, as I don't really have all _that _much time to work on), I'd consider making an exception for this 750 to add something unique, since he's a unique case. \n\nIf you have a great idea, please leave your very best MS paint sketch below :)","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-11-05T22:57:35.349+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Beardilocks,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=qIvkQl9a,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2018-11-05T22:53:23.936+0000)If you have a great idea, please leave your very best MS paint sketch below\n\nI'm no Paint Master, but I'd consider simply making the effect a blue or green shifted version of the default particle (simpler to skin in the upper row, second from the left) and replacing the fly particles with, say, outlines of balls and jacks.

I agree that there needed to be some change to the way his rage was visually represented, because for anyone who plays against Renekton, sometimes it isn't clear when he reaches 50+ fury. While this isn't a significant change for Renekton players (who have already developed a good sense for fury management and thus can easily keep track of it), I do think it is important for other players and for the sake of overall clarity.\n\nHowever, to be blunt, I believe that the visual indicators attached to his fury mechanic are straight up poor, for a couple of reasons. Like others have pointed out [[1](https://i.imgur.com/foNgQ66.png), [2](https://i.imgur.com/aCdOUCG.png), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/9uifhd/visual_effects_update_renekton/e94m95k/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/9uifhd/visual_effects_update_renekton/e94rf94/)], the 'glowing hands' theme is overused because of items such as Duskblade and Sheen, and my personal belief is that, in the first place, 'glowing hands' is an unfit indicator for the mechanic that it tries to represent. Unlike auto-attack modifiers, Renekton's fury mechanic is more akin to a state of mind, similar to Rumble's overheat, where both champions have access to empowered abilities once they reach a resource threshold. This is much different from just having another effect added onto your next auto-attack. Not to mention, it will look _and_ feel awkward walking around in lane with all these bright visuals attached to your character and nothing to expend your fury on. It looks silly and feels bad. Imagine missing a Q stack on Nasus and waiting for the glow on your cane to expire while the next minion wave hits. That's how I see it playing out with Renekton, except it'll feel worse when his visual effects are much more pronounced. With all that being said, other posters that I've quoted have suggested that, alternatively, Renekton could instead have fury indicators moved to his weapon, or that he could grow more red with more fury he has built up. I like the latter idea a lot more and I support it.\n\nAside from the glowing hands, I'm a big fan of the red eyes as a fury indicator. The idea is fucking cool and I love it, but I feel like the execution was lackluster, because it looks like [someone slapped two red light bulbs on both halves of his head and called it a day](https://i.imgur.com/NkSOzsC.png). There is [another post](https://i.imgur.com/jW1f6UM.png) that reflects my thoughts on this, but in any case, I definitely think it would be an improvement to change the effects on his eyes from a glow to a glint, similar to [Renekton's old splash](http://lolwp.com/wp-content/uploads/Renekton-Classic-Skin.jpg) or the [icon on Renekton's passive](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/f/fa/Reign_of_Anger.png/revision/latest?cb=20180301214818). Personally, I would love to see a darker shade of red used for the glint in his eyes, and I think it would be an even better idea to attach a lingering trail to it, similar to the effects on Deadman's Plate or Xin Zhao's spear when he activates Q. Imagine what it would look like when Renekton dashes or spins with 50+ fury. The last comment I want to make on the fury visuals is that, in the video preview, it was difficult to see the glow on his eyes for the duration of his ult. The intensity of his new sandstorm contributed to the lack of clarity, but I also think the size on his visual effects should match the size increase he gets from his ult. \n\nMoving on from his passive, the next thing I want to talk about are his basic attacks, and by extension, his W. A _lot_ of people [[1](https://i.imgur.com/NnuzYSd.png), [2](https://i.imgur.com/23gRzNk.png), [3](https://i.imgur.com/pdRqZwE.png), [4](https://i.imgur.com/sN5yYFT.png), [5](https://i.imgur.com/3Tq0oRJ.png), [6](https://i.imgur.com/5FMf3x2.png), [7](https://i.imgur.com/Dnu0xRD.png)] don't think that the mini-explosions fit Renekton's auto-attacks. Many of them, like myself, believe that Renekton should have a slicing visual effect to complement his auto-attacks instead. My personal justification for this is that, for one, Renekton uses a bladed weapon, which would only make this intuitive, and secondly, it complements his identity as a butcher. A couple of posters have also mentioned that Renekton's W should have multiple auto-attack visuals instead of 1 when he stuns a target, which would make sense to change because his W is followed by multiple instances of damage. That's all I have to say on his auto-attacks and his W.\n\nI'm really excited about Renekton's new Q and I think you guys did a phenomenal job on it. I'm loving the colors on the empowered version and I didn't expect to see it leave marks on the ground like how God-King Darius does. New trend? In any case, I like it a lot. The only thing I would suggest is to make the impressions left on the ground exclusive to the empowered Q. With how relatively spammable Renekton's Q is, I think it would carry more weight this way if only the empowered version came with that special effect. The idea that he can disfigure terrain if he's angry enough is something I can definitely get behind. \n\nAs far as Renekton's new E goes, I like the idea. The only minor gripe I have with it is that, because the sand follows him slowly, it also makes Renekton seem slow during his dash. The motion of the sand doesn't make complete sense either, because he moves like a drill and you would expect the sand to spray outward as a result. Other than that, I think it's a cool concept. \n\nLast but not least is his ultimate. I have a couple of things I dislike about the new ult, but I'll start by saying that the visuals look way nicer than before, which is a plus. It's fitting and it actually looks like a sandstorm. But otherwise, to explain my issues with the changes, I've always thought of Renekton's ultimate as this big power-up that you give yourself to become a raid boss, which in concept, is exactly the same as Nasus' ult. Both of their ultimates are supposed to make them appear more menacing, but with these new visuals, I feel that this aspect of Renekton's ult has been taken away from him. In my opinion, the issue boils down to two things: the new visuals on his ultimate draw too much attention away from Renekton himself, and the other is that you barely notice his size increase anymore. To start off, here is a visual comparison of [Renekton's current ultimate](https://i.imgur.com/BRt2gf9.jpg) vs. [Renekton's updated ultimate](https://i.imgur.com/k1tYWAU.jpg) (as shown in the video). Because there is more action packed into his new ultimate, and lot more space on the screen is taken up by the sandstorm and not by Renekton, there will naturally be a shift in visual weight. More people will focus on what's around him than focus on Renekton himself, which is not the point of a power-up. Even if the numbers behind his size increase are untouched, it doesn't _feel_ like he's towering above other champions. Other people have noticed this [[1](https://i.imgur.com/EYq42YH.png), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/9uifhd/visual_effects_update_renekton/e94icwj/)], and while I'm not trying to make Beardilocks look like a bad guy or anything, it is upsetting to me, given the context of my post, to basically be told to [\"look harder\"](https://i.imgur.com/gs9Efsn.png) for a visual effect that is supposed to be obvious at glance. Once again, I'm sorry, I don't mean to antagonize anyone. But in any case, when it comes to restoring the menacing aspect of Renekton's ult, my suggestion would be to either make the sandstorm more transparent and/or to have it animate slower, similar to the speed at which his current ult moves. \nIn addition, on the topic of the AOE indicator on Renekton's ult, I agree with [Rydon's point](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/qIvkQl9a-visual-effects-update-renekton?show=nested&comment=002f) about why the indicator is unnecessary. This goes back to my previous point about visual weight, but I also feel that the AOE indicator also detracts from Renekton's size increase. Aside from visual weight however, putting an indicator around Renekton's ult would be like putting an indicator around Tibbers, ASol's stars, Shyvana's W, or Amumu's W when their visual effects are enough to not warrant a clear circle. There is also an argument to be made that an indicator isn't necessary for Renekton because his ultimate is not intended to be used like a zoning tool.\n\nIf you've gotten to this point, thanks for reading everything I wrote. I know it may have sounded like I was mostly unsatisfied with the VFX update, but I _am_ happy that you guys are taking the time and effort to touch on these older champions, so this is very refreshing.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to add this in my post because it was minor, but currently when Renekton ults, he flashes his symbol at both the start and end of his ult. But in the video, the end symbol isn't there anymore :( Will it be coming back? I thought it was really cool because it felt like another way to say 'this is the end result' or 'this is what remains.'

Even in the case of extra work, if the extra work is focused on making the chromas spiffier with base Renektoy just getting side benefit that seems ok.\n\nI actually have Renektoy amusingly. His current VFX, while very understated and minimal, do not detract from him at all. The pool party R is quite neutral and I didn't even realize what it was until now. In contrast, I think that the new VFX detract in a way current one doesn't. Though that's almost entirely the added bugs but am not sure the color matches well either. I'd need to see it live on PBE to really judge. Still green backdropped with blue changed to green backdropped with yellow.\n\nNew VFX impressions for renektoy:\nPassive - Room to make this VFX more toy like. The eyes being a fog don't fit a toy as well as a couple of solid beams that look like they are from cheap LEDs/bad commercial VFX.\nQ - Seems totally ok\nW- Seems totally ok. Be nice to get a little \"chop\" sound effect bubble.\nE- Sand feels a bit out of place\nR- Sand and bugs feel out of place\n\nSo I seem to have this line of thought that maybe pushing Renektoy into a bad 90s toy commercial direction could work? Might be pretty easy to bash together some vfx for simple vector shapes in single tone color to throw into a more vibrant ult like a 90s background. Or maybe it'd be possible to add sound bubble \"sound effects\" as particles? That could be justified as RnD to have a method for doing it for another skin down the line.\n\n[Have a crappy mockup.](https://imgur.com/av1bnXy) Basically 90s backgrounds are just really simple vector graphics on bright colors. There's a lot of variety. You could use a blue background for the R VFX but make it more \"neon\" or bright. Then replace the bugs with some shapes and squiggles. Chroma compatibility could come from altering the particle colors to match each chroma.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zekrom1010101010","date":"2018-11-06T05:30:03.942+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"AA, Passive, Q, E, and R look great (Q especially, God King Darius sends his Regards), but the W changes are difficult to see.

This Monday we&amp;#039;re kicking off coverage of our VFX and SFX updates with Renekton.\n> \n> Similar to the [recent Jarvan, Lee Sin, Veigar, and Vi updates](https://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/client-new-features-feedback/J8p5dlpl-visual-effect-and-sound-effect-updates-to-jarvan-lee-sin-veigar-and-vi), we&amp;#039;re working on VFX and SFX updates to more champions whose spell effects are in need of some love to get to current League standards and improve gameplay readability. In Patch 8.24, we&amp;#039;ll be releasing updates for Anivia, Dr. Mundo, Gragas (VFX only; SFX shipped in patch 8.21), and Teemo. Keep an eye on this post and we&amp;#039;ll add visual previews as they become ready! Please try them out on the PBE&amp;mdash;especially if you&amp;#039;re a main&amp;mdash;when they&amp;#039;re in and leave us your feedback here!\n> \n> Today&amp;#039;s post focuses on the _visual effects_ for Renekton. Please note that he **will** be receiving some _sound effects_ updates as well, but they are not included in this preview.\n> \n> #Renekton\n> Passive - Glowing hand VFX are more clear, and his eyes glow red to match the ability icon\n> BA - Updated impact FX\n> Q - Now has some effects to show the range. Note that when Renekton is in his Ultimate form, the effects scale up to match the increased size of the hitbox (and yes, it really is that big when he has ulted!)\n> W - Mostly unchanged\n> E - Cleaned up VFX with some sand for more satisfaction. Much clearer VFX when he uses his passive empowered Dice for gameplay readability\n> R - New Transformation effects with a swirling sandstorm around him, with a clearer range indicator. Flying dragonflies are now swarming scarab beetles.\n> \n> https://youtu.be/2Svl4NOaCdE\n> \n> \n> All of Renekton&amp;#039;s skins have been updated to use these new VFX.\n> \n> Certain skins have some recolored VFX:\n> \n> Galactic - Recolored Ult\n> Bloodfury - Recolored Ult\n> Outback - Same as base\n> Rune Wars - Slightly updated Ult, with a new unique decal\n> Scorched Earth - Slightly updated Ult to make range clearer\n> Pool Party - Slightly updated Ult to make range clearer. Q uses updated VFX, but recolored green for unempowered version\n> Prehistoric - Same as base\n> SKT T1 - Recolored ult, with a new unique decal featuring the SKT logo. Q and E use updated VFX, but recolored blue for unempowered version. \n> Renektoy - Changed to use Base&amp;#039;s updated VFX\n> \n> https://imgur.com/a/T8OEFuQ\n\nJust change the pool party sounds please,it's horrible,every renekton main hates that and they stoped using the skin,just bring the basic sound at least(default metalic blade sounds).Thank you!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Schococroco","date":"2018-11-21T11:11:29.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love the visual update, but the renektoy ult animation changes would be sad, i understand that he shouldn't have special effects, but taking away something that people who bought the skin enjoyed and maybe bought it for feels horrible :/\n\nEdit: i also think that the normal ult animation just does not fit Renektoy, it looks very disrupting, because it breaks the style of the skin","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eyboss2244","date":"2018-11-14T09:08:16.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am really hoping Blood fury {{champion:58}}  gets an update on his skin splash art.
