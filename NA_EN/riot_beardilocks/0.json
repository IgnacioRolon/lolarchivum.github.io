These are updates to the visuals and sounds only, and do not include any gameplay updates. Our aim is to get their FX to current League standards and improve gameplay clarity. In Patch 9.4, we'll be releasing VFX and SFX updates for and Wukong, and VFX-only updates Olaf, Riven and Kennen (he already received some SFX love a few patches ago). \r\n\r\nWe're looking for early feedback now on these videos, but they will be added to the PBE soon. Please try them out there —especially if you're a main—when they're available and leave us your feedback!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#Kennen\r\n_VFX update across the board to clean up unnecessary noise and improve gameplay clarity.\r\nKennen received SFX updates several patches ago_\r\n\r\n**BA **- Basic attacks are more easily distinguished from Q\r\n**Q** - Q is more distinguished from BA, has increased satisfaction and a unique impact VFX\r\n**W** - Increased visual satisfaction\r\n**E** - Kennen has all new VFX for lightning rush. This has a key change to keep Kennen's silhouette during the animation for gameplay clarity, with an added range indicator. Blood moon Kennen has received a similar update, and Super Kennen has a superhero pose, though it still uses base VFX\r\n**R** - Increased visual satisfaction and reduced noise\r\n**P** - When Kennen procs his passive on a champion or monster it now has a clear 3 mark VFX to show the source of the stun. Passive marks on minions are reduced in size and brightness to add clarity to gameplay\r\n\r\nPlease note that all skins other than Blood Moon use Kennen's Base VFX (with the exception of their unique shaped shuriken)\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/o8UrWyW\r\n\r\n**Base VFX**\r\nhttps://youtu.be/P0KGxCelxjI\r\n\r\n**Blood Moon**\r\nhttps://youtu.be/0n5cK2CNPkI\r\n\r\n**Super Kennen E Pose**\r\nhttps://youtu.be/DriFUjHx8OU\r\n\r\n\r\n#Olaf\r\n_VFX update across the board to clean up unnecessary noise and improve gameplay clarity._\r\n\r\n**BA** - Basic attacks now have swipes and a new hit effect\r\n**Q** - Q missile now has a hitbox indicator. The pick-up range is now visible. Pick-up also has a new effect\r\n**W** - Increased visual satisfaction and readability. Removed old noisy runes. Heal effect is now clearer, too\r\n**E** - New lightning effect and swipes!\r\n**R** - Clearer and better visuals for R activation and buff. Olaf doesn't turn just red anymore.\r\n\r\nAll of Olaf's skins have been updated to be closer to these VFX. Brolaf has some new unique VFX.\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/WIslpyj\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/ARB86F2iAV4\r\n\r\n\r\n#Riven\r\n_VFX update across the board to clean up unnecessary noise and improve gameplay clarity.\r\n\r\n**BA **- Cleaned up noise (removed the blood!)\r\n**Q** - All three Q's have unique slashes, and now properly show the area of damage\r\n**W** - Updated the ability to bring it more into League's current visual style, while providing more clarity to the hitbox\r\n**E** - Riven's sword pieces now shield her when she dashes. Also brought the shield up to current VFX standards\r\n**R** - Cleaned up the random visual effects that play around her body/hand, but added more emphasis/glow on her sword. All abilities should now properly reflect the larger ranges during ult, and the Wind Slash is now clearer and more unified.\r\n**P** - The hilt of her sword (and the first shard of it) should now glow when her passive is active. Cleaned up the noise.\r\n\r\nPlease note that none of Riven's animations or actual gameplay  have been changed at all.\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/74MsZiX\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/mzko51K0iyk\r\n\r\n#Wukong\r\n\r\n_VFX update across the board to clean up unnecessary visual noise_\r\n\r\n*BA* - Basic attacks now have a swipe and new hit effect\r\n*Q* - Q now has a cleaner more powerful swipe, unique hit effect, and removed noisy fx\r\n*W* - Removed unnecessary amounts of clouds and pushed back visual priority\r\n*E* - New clouds and wisps!\r\n*R* - Clearer visuals\r\n\r\nSome skins have received minor updates to reduce unnecessary noise and increase satisfaction of their VFX\r\n\r\nSound effect updates are planned for Wukong for 9.4, but are not included in this preview video.

Her particles are in fact quite dated.\n- I think the color palette and brightness should be adjusted. Riven's classic skin follows green tons currently on live. However, the suggested particle updated makes her feel like a champion that throws poison everywhere. Try to go for a mix between Emerald shades and some dust / sand colors.\n- Passive: I like the idea, but it needs a color touch-up. The glow on the base of the sword is a bit too distracting for some reason ? I think a too large area of the blade is being affected by this VFX. I think it should be kept around the base of the sword and the Rune markings, no more. \n- Q particles : I think those feel good in general, however the circle on the ground for Q1 and Q2 is too much. I think there should be some randomized obfuscating so that not the whole circle shows up, only the arc that Riven visually swipes with the model's animation.\n- W feels unsatisfying and just too quick overall. It feels like you're just casting a larger Cassiopeia Q on yourself, not like a burst of energy ... I think it's important to have a clear, flashy effect (as I said, color palette needs to be brighter emerald). Try to add in a few rays going outside of Riven, they really convey that feeling of letting out a burst of energy. I think this ability is probably the one I'm least happy with.\n- E particles: nothing to say, looks good, feels satisfying, and completely up to date with current standards. Could do with a color palette adjustment just like the rest, but it doesn't feel as necessary for this one.\n- R1 : okay this is gonna be a bit long. An old post about Riven's development explained how initially it was intended for her sword to *gradually* reforge from the base during the cast time. I was hoping a particle update would actually bring it. In the post, the reason they say it was scrapped is because 0.25 cast time is too short. As a custom-skin maker and Riven player, I can say that 0.25s is clearly enough for the sword to (rapidly) scroll from the base to the tip and reappear like that, instead of what we have.\n- R2 : Wind Slash is nice, a bit bland (could do with extra effects like some dust trails or something). A trail like on Dragonblade Riven (the smoke trails look really good) with dusty colors could be cool I guess.\n\n- A side note here: particles are no longer different between no R and R ???? Riven's Q and W have noticeably different particles on live to accentuate the hype of the moment, it feels great gameplay wise and reminds us that Q and W hitboxes are larger during R. I feel like the particles during that moment could do with quite some extra oomph.\n\n- Why remove the blood from Auto attacks and Q hit ? I can understand for Q but I think it's an important reason that makes autos satisfying. Yasuo gets blood on his autos, why not Riven ? (I know it makes it annoying to censor it for Chinese servers, but cmon). The current on-hit particle makes it feel like I'm playing Twitch and not Riven.\n\nOVERALL CONCLUSIONS\n\n- Particles are great! In my opinion only a couple tweaks are needed\n\n1. Move color palette to this yellowish-green to a slightly more Emerald green alongside with occasional dusty / sandy accents.\n2. Q and W particles feel like a cloud of poison. VFX are too dark, need to feel flashier, especially W. Q circles on the ground don't need to be represented in their entirety, especially because the hitbox isn't a full circle (unless I'm mistaken about my main monkaS)\n3. E is great, only would bennefit from 1.\n4. R is fine, could do with improvements but is fine as is. Improvements would significantly improve satisfaction though (dust trail behind wind slash and \"scrolling\" sword reforging animation).\n\nCheers\n\nEDIT: After thinking about it, I think there's a choice to be made between 2 color schemes.\n\n1. Mostly Emerald green with Sand/Dust accents to emphasize satisfaction\n2. Mostly Sand/Dust colors with occasional Emerald green accents to highlight the use of \"rune magic\" or w/e it's called.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AgorTheDamned","date":"2019-01-31T03:41:51.593+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am a fan of the Riven Q3 and Windslash, but the rest of her abilities look too magicky-green.

I feel like putting more grey/white in there would help a lot. Much like Riven's own visual design, I feel like green should be the accent color, with neutral tones being more primary. \n\nOr, in terms of conveyance, implying that Riven is a  *sword*fighter, with some magic/ki stuff mixed in there. Also she's supposed to have wind-theming, right? Hence Yasuo's \"That wind technique...\" line. So I'd expect white/greys to be the primary color for her effects, with green accents. \n\nOlaf's changes look great, but I feel the big 'swipe' animation that accompanies his attacks are a little off. They seem pretty big for the comparatively small swings he makes with his axes, and I think the swipe appears just a frame or two too early - before he's begun to move the axe in earnest. I'd normally request an edit to the swing animation, but you implied these are just gonna be particle changes, yeah?\n\nShout out to Wukong's particles though - those are easily my favorite of this update. Really clean looking, I particularly love the bright highlight on the border of his ult. I'd like to see the rest of his autoattack animations though, too.

There are too many dark greens and some of the effects look like those from other poison effects. This makes her look like a poison-based fighter from Zaun, which is not what the VFX should be portraying.

Everything else is great, but he looks like a fish/fighter jet in this. He _looks_ like he's slower, which is weird since I can plainly see he's not by looking at the stats tab. He looks like he's just harmlessly floating toward someone. The loss of his funnel type effect on E is extremely noticeable and really hurts his fantasy. Not to mention he looks bigger which does no favors to playing against him. The AoE field around him is appreciated but it's also misleading for both the Kennen player and his foes. The area indicated does not deal damage as is suggested because it's instead directly on his hit box. I don't really understand the point of creating the illusion that his E hit box is larger than it really is. It ony makes it so Kennen appears bigger than he is which can cause his foes to misjudge his spacing. Whiffing crucial skill shots and stuff like that. \n\nHis hit box is not clearly defined and he completely lost his speed (visual effects). Making him appear as a solid ball instead of a nearly translucent one is a big enough change to Kennen. You don't need to also make him appear larger than he actually is because that causes nearly the same type of issue as you set out to correct.","replies":[]},{"poster":"6FlagsFunnelCake","date":"2019-01-31T02:24:06.198+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Love all of these!

So gj on that. The rest, well... not that great. Why you ask. Well here's why:\nOlaf looks more like a magical creature and less like a Viking. I don't play him so not a lot of comments here. He's meh imo.\nAbout Riven, well I don't really like her e that much but ok. I  don't play her either(for now), but she doesn't look bad.\n\nKennen... now Kennen is another story... Wtf have you done to him? Why does he look that bluish? Is that a shuriken he's throwing? I can't tell! \n1) Q - Q is more distinguished from BA, has increased satisfaction and a unique impact VFX => that Q, with all that aura, is bigger than his head!!!\n2) W - Increased visual satisfaction => Wait what?!?!? LOL. More like a straight line, no satisfaction here! The electricity on Olaf is more visual appealing :/\n3) E - Kennen has all new VFX for lightning rush. This has a key change to keep Kennen's silhouette during the animation for gameplay clarity bla bla bla... \n=> for whose clarity is that? I really don't like the silhouette thing, maybe for Super Kennen skin (not!). I find transforming into a ball of lightning unique and very mage like. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT TOUCH THIS.\n4) R - Increased visual satisfaction and reduced noise => Actually thumbs up on this one, visually it's great.\n\nMore electricity, less blue and blurriness please. He's a mage, not a cartoon. Thank you.\n\nKind regards,\nA Kennen main  {{champion:85}} \n\nP.S.

Feels good to finally see the actual hitboxes of his spells. His new shurikens look amazing. Q looks really satisfying and I personally like the new E animation.\n\nYet am I the only one to think that **the color palette used feels a bit weird** ? \n\n* It looks too blue imo, and thus less \"lightning\". Especially for his E and his ult, which almost look like some sort of water magic to me. \n\n\n* This might be amplified by the fact that his spells look less \"sharp\", if it makes sense.\n\n\n* The white from his spells almost completely disappeared (except from his ult when it lands on people and from his new stun animation, which looks great btw). \n\nI think adding more white into the colors (and maybe a bit more sparks? or something else to make it less smooth) would be beneficial, because it would match his SFX better and simply feel more like Kennen !\n\n\n{{champion:85}}\n\n\n_Edit_ -  After reading other comments, turns out I'm not the only one to have that opinion !\n\n> [{quoted}](name=KestrelGirl,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=6r5PBr2Y,comment-id=0015,timestamp=2019-01-31T02:14:28.073+0000)  Kennen doesn&#x27;t look... sharp anymore.

Final swing of the Q feels powerful because of the shockwave while the other two look like she's just swatting flies. The W looks like a release of poison gas, I feel like it doesn't fit Riven thematically. Looks like something I'd expect from Twitch or Urgot. Finally, something about the second cast of the R looks flat. Is this a \"Wind Cutter\" type move or a \"Blade Beam\"?
