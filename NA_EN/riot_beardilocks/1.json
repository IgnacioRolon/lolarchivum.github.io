In Patch 8.24, we&#039;ll be releasing VFX and SFX updates for Anivia, Dr. Mundo and Renekton, and VFX-only updates for Gragas (he already received some SFX love) and Teemo. Please try them out on the PBE&mdash;especially if you&#039;re a main&mdash;when they&#039;re in and leave us your feedback here!\n\nToday&#039;s preview covers the visual effects updates to Gragas, the Rabble Rouser. Gragas&#039; sound effects updates were shipped in patch 8.21.\n\n**VFX**\n_VFX update across the board to clean up unnecessary noise and improve gameplay clarity._\nBA - New hit impacts for more satisfaction\nQ - Improved ring indicator and liquid visuals show Aoe more clearly\nW - Enhanced character effects to communicate that Gragas has a damage reduction, bubbles are less noisy\nE - A shockwave shows the AoE clearly, and has distinct impact FX\nR - Improved liquid visuals that more closely match the AoE and feel more impactful\n\nAll of Gragas&#039; skins except for Arctic Ops Gragas have had their VFX updated. \nOktoberfest and Vandal gragas have updated beer VFX.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/L2GvFjW2JbE\n\nhttps://youtu.be/0FiOkq-2i-I\n\n_Please use this thread to give feedback on **Gragas&#039; VFX**.

However, looking at the tooltip this ability does magic damage! We use orange generally for physical hits in the game (just like his Auto attacks) and this ability looks like a physical attack, so I changed it to blue which is the usual colour for magic damage abilties. I might try some purple in there, but his W already uses purple for all of its FX, and I wanted to make sure that players could clearly distinguish which ability they'd been hit by.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-11-02T18:26:27.078+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Beardilocks,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=pjKXqRsl,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2018-11-02T18:18:13.657+0000)I might try some purple in there, but his W already uses purple for all of its FX, and I wanted to make sure that players could clearly distinguish which ability they&#x27;d been hit by.\n\nI think you could probably make this pretty apparent with a few more particles on the back end of the effect so the path is more visible, maybe?

Differentiating the ult and Q is the thing I've been struggling the hardest with on these VFX updates, since they're both just liquid exploding out of a barrel :/ I think it's safe to say if we made gragas nowadays, we would not have two of his abilties basically being the same thing but having different effects. I added a bright glow around the barrel on the ult so that people could hopefully see when he was ulting a bit easier, but i'll see if i can amp the brightness a little more.\n\nThanks for pointing out the W on Oktoberfest, I will make sure that it is more clearly visible, and might tone down the brightness on his base VFX as well.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-11-02T18:15:17.218+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Beardilocks,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=pjKXqRsl,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2018-11-02T18:07:05.734+0000)Thanks for your feedback.\n\nMy pleasure!\n\n>Differentiating the ult and Q is the thing I've been struggling the hardest with on these VFX updates, since they're both just liquid exploding out of a barrel :/\n\nIt's definitely a tricky one, yeah. Is there the possibility of putting more barrel elements into the ultimate so it's a bit more cask explosion than the Q, or a longer lingering effect of some kind, like a small crater? Either that or perhaps make the ult into a more physical barrel burst with a fountain of wine that follows? Would have to actually explore it a bit first to have better input though, and, sadly, I don't have time at the moment. :(\n\n> Thanks for pointing out the W on Oktoberfest, I will make sure that it is more clearly visible, and might tone down the brightness on his base VFX as well.\n\nAwesome!

I don't know if it's possible to shade the explosion indicator to follow the same color progression as the barrel's timer, but that would be the best possible case. You might also be able to use the thickness of the indicator as a similar cook timer (e.g. 1px/2px/3px for instant/halfway/full damage).\n\n2) If Oktoberfest Gragas is getting specific updates, would it be possible to reinstate the trail of lost pretzels on his Body Slam?
