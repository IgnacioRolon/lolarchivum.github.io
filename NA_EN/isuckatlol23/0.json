Any help would be appreciated. I'm a fairly new level 30 and I was wondering if anyone could give me their opinion of Riven? I never considered buying her until I got the Dragonblade Riven skin shard from the project loot boxes. Is she difficult to play? Is that even considered a good skin? Is she worth purchasing? Idk. My play style is pretty diverse. I can play any role and enjoy it fairly well. Sorry for being such a noob.","replies":[{"poster":"Teémò","date":"2016-08-18T02:58:21.066+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's my favorite skin for her, the particle effects are pretty rad :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-08-18T02:52:16.932+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very good, but also extremely high-skill. Complex kit and a reliance on fast reactions and animation-canceling, she plays more like an adc than a melee champ. This is why you see so many top scrubs playing riven, and typically feeding.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LadyRenly","date":"2016-08-18T02:49:15.123+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She takes time to learn, but she is pretty pub stompy","replies":[]},{"poster":"ISuckAtLoL23","date":"2016-08-18T20:45:00.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for all the help guys :-) I think I may buy Darius for now and just wait until I'm a bit better and get Riven.
