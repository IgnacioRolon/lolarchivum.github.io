The insults I'll grant you though -- but, unlike cursing, and insult exists solely to offend someone else, and yeah, that behavior will get you punished.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahpe","date":"2018-07-27T13:42:11.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about saying \"tf are you doing\" ?","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-07-27T13:47:26.955+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ahpe,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=wwx2A5yM,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2018-07-27T13:42:11.934+0000)\n>\n> What about saying &quot;tf are you doing&quot; ?\n\nOnce or twice this is probably fine.
