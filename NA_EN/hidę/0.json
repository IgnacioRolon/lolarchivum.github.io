This issue is most often caused by local network configurations that conflict with League, so I'd recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to get everything compatible.\n\nLet me know if you continue to experience this issue after taking those steps.","replies":[{"poster":"hidę","date":"2016-11-16T08:42:21.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After disabling windows defender, the client started, once.

The client started, and it's downloading the game. I honestly did nothing between the time of it not working and now. So my only thought is that my ISP is doing something wonky. At this time I'm downloading the game and will provide an update once it's finished.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
