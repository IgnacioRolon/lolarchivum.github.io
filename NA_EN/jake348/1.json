I'd recommend submitting some of your logs through our [Log Reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) which can analyze your network logs from League and give a better idea of whether or not it's packet loss, ping instability, etc.\n\nShould give us a better idea of what's going on and when.

As I walk, I just keep jumping around the screen, but it's usually over by the end of the first minute. It's been this way for a few years now.","replies":[]}]}]}
