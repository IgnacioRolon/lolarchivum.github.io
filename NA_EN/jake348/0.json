If it's packet loss you're getting and it doesn't go away, you may need to contact your ISP for help.\n\nPlease follow the steps (if there are any you haven't completed) on the [Connection Troubleshooting Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to make sure your connection is set up properly.\n\nIf those steps don't help, you can view your connection by running a traceroute, and sharing the results might show us where it's going wrong.
