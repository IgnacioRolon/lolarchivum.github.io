It really made me feel for Riven and even a bit for Yasuo. It kind of makes me want more, though I don&#039;t expect anything new for Riven, since I feel it wrapped up neatly enough. I&#039;m glad she at least got a happier ending. I know she&#039;ll still have to deal with the guilt, but it&#039;s nice to see how she went from wishing for death not wanting to hope, to seeming to finally have a little hope for atonement and a future to look forward to, and even a family to love her.\r\n\r\nI just want to say, really nicely done.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-05-24T04:23:42.563+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad you enjoyed it!

Because Riven no longer wishes to be associated with Noxus, and now lives and works in Ionia.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-05-25T01:52:06.839+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's definitely part of a wider conversation. She's still Noxian through and through, but she realised Noxus wasn't what it appeared to be from the outside... and actually, she found more of the \"family\" acceptance in Ionia.\n\nTo be continued, for certain.","replies":[{"poster":"sweetrules","date":"2018-05-25T02:27:12.380+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I look forward to hearing more whenever you guys have something new to add to that. And yeah, Noxus gave her a place and a weapon then pointed her at their enemies. Ionia gave her something worth much more in my mind, as you said, family.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-05-25T03:04:04.597+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just wonder what she'll think of Swain, if she heads back home...","replies":[{"poster":"sweetrules","date":"2018-05-25T03:20:30.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is a curious thing. Though I do wonder what would inspire Riven to go back and leave Asa and Shava behind. Though now you do have me wondering if you're hinting at something you guys have planned, though I'm sure you probably can't give any solid details yet.

Sign me up. If there is one criticism I have of broken blade is about part 3 (the first two parts were great) and how I wish the end would amount to more and have a greater impact.","replies":[{"poster":"sweetrules","date":"2018-05-25T03:26:36.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel the impact was pretty good. Sure, it wasn't some fanfare moment of revelation. But giving a broken woman hope for the future and a family is pretty good if you ask me. 1, 2, and even a good part of 3 show us just how broken and defeated Riven is. But at the end, she is no longer looking for death, she's looking towards the future, and I think that's a pretty big change.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-06-08T06:46:16.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just finished it too.
