For some reason, the game randomly freezes on a Yellow/Purple/Green screen, causing audio to just become static and almost ALWAYS requiring a PC reset. \n\nI&#039;ve had this issue on multiple computers, and on each one I&#039;ve repaired the client, cleaned out the computer to ensure it wasn&#039;t overheating, and done a system restore, hoping it was some sort of windows bug (Didn&#039;t appear to be).  The bug would cease to appear for a few games, but would always end up coming back without any sort of notice. (Be it a few days, a week, a month, or the last half of the year.)\n\nI&#039;ve seen multiple threads created about this issue, both on the old forums and the boards, but never an official RIot response. This bug has been causing me disconnects at the worst of times, causing me to end up having a low-priority queue punishment because of how it has affected my matches over the year. This isn&#039;t a plead to remove that, but just to see if I can get an answer as to what is causing this bug in order to prevent it from affecting both myself and other players in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-01-05T01:17:13.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My first suspicion is a graphics card/driver issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ACriticalThinker","date":"2019-01-05T00:37:43.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just had this now but it was a minute before we were about to win so thank goodness it didnt cause me to lose","replies":[]}]}
