I would love to not only see some champions maybe be lost, but others grow and change.  Development of characters is more exciting than preservation of what we have, provided it is true to the character as we know them.\n\nThe main issue I think Riot will have with this is that those of us that love the lore and champions as characters are in the minority so there's always the notion of \"how will a person react when their main is 'killed' for the sake of lore?\"  The Gangplank main outrage is some proof of this (although granted at that point in time, he was disabled so they couldn't play him which sucked).  Will as many people flock to play Sylas if they know that Garen kills him?  Or Kayn if in the lore he loses the battle against Raast?  Or Zed if he is killed by Shen?  I know that if in the lore, unless it was done well, if something were to happen to Morgana or Ezreal or Lucian or one of my other favourite champs, it would sting a bit.  Ultimately, I can see Riot wanting to keep champions as these iconic legends rather than fluid, moving characters like in a novel or series so that people can always enjoy them as they are.\n\nSo I totally understand if Riot doesn't want to go that direction, but I would personally love to see it.\n\nHope I'm not babbling and nice to meet you too =P","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Thailand05","date":"2019-11-06T10:38:36.061+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Agree with this one....and Hi!

Summoners and all related things are no longer canonical. At most it's just summoning representations of champions, much like you're not *actually* summoning the god of creation when you play with Pokemon cards, you're just using a representation of him and his abilities. If a champion dies in lore there's no reason you can't still use a representation of them in what amounts to live-action Magic the Gathering.","replies":[{"poster":"Thailand05","date":"2019-11-06T07:42:56.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We still can play them we know but I talk about Die (Destroy) in the lore Permenently.(Gameplay is not canon anyway)\n\nAnd about Gankplank (He still be Back later) that not Die(Destroy) in the lore Permenently.\n\nThere are ALWAYS fates worse than death.

(fates worse than death dont count)\n\nI'd argue that they can easily undergo something that's so fundamentally altering that they're functionally dead. If you get taken over by a Darkin you're *technically* still alive but...not really. There's no \"you\" left anymore. Your body might be alive, but it's not you. It's possible you're still \"there\", somewhere, suppressed and buried by the Darkin (99% sure that's the case with the two guys Varus got), and it might technically be possible to recover you, but...until then you're basically dead. If you're taken *and* corrupted by the Mist, you're fucking gone. You've ceased to actually be you, in the same way you've ceased to be you once a Darkin takes over. We know that the Void drove many Ascended to insanity and **turned them into the Darkin**, so god knows what it could potentially do to a fairly normal human champion like Cait or Draven.\n\nIf what makes you *you* is destroyed, you're effectively gone. Even if your body remains, you have ceased to actually be *you*, which is more than close enough to being destroyed forever. Except you *continue to suffer* if you're just \"locked away\", and have to watch your body be controlled by this...thing. You have died but suffered a fate *potentially worse than hell itself*.\n\n> Kalista dead yes...but she not Destroy yet even Moderkiser ready to be back someday.\n\nKalista...can't really \"die\" from this point on. She's a spirit of vengeance. Unless someone's going to go all Ghostbusters her ass, it's safe to assume she won't be dying.","replies":[{"poster":"Thailand05","date":"2019-11-06T09:26:18.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the Game we play Darkin already even champs who taken and corrupted by the Mist version (not human version)\n\nso in that what we play in the game they still not destroy in the lore.\n\n\"There's no \"you\" left\" If U play as them that what they are right now.
