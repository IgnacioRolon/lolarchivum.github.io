Is this your first season too? If you have these types of basic questions, read the news which they post almost daily (except on Sundays). If they have info on upcoming changes they post it a day or two ahead of changes. They stated that players would be placed in a lower position at the start of the season. On top of that perhaps your overall performance was that bad that you were demoted to your current level.","replies":[{"poster":"Leagueistoxic","date":"2016-11-15T14:17:46.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, it was good xD and it's not my first season.","replies":[{"poster":"Leagueistoxic","date":"2016-11-15T14:18:21.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I climbed up a bunch of ranks and then got put back into what I was originally placed after WINNING this 1 extra placement.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jimmy Johns","date":"2016-11-15T13:57:08.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't work.
