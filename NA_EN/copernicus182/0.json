Keep in mind however that issues such as you are describing are not due to the inherent coding of the Client, but rather an issue with your connection.\n\nChampion Select is the one place where you need to have a consistent connection, otherwise you will face serious errors/issues, such as the ones you have experienced.  This is the case because not only does your computer need to communicate to the Server properly, but the Server then needs to take your information, and provide it to the 9 other Summoners in the same game.  To that end, make sure that you complete all of the steps in the following Knowledge Base Article in hopes of resolving this issue:\n\nhttps://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/21696815\n\nIf you are still getting docked LP for errors in Champion Selection, even after completing all of these steps, then please do not hesitate to let us know in Player Support by submitting a new [Support Ticket](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new).
