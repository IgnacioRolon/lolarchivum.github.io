After the rework, he just feels like another generic juggernaut with no interesting features. What other champions have a feel when playing them similar to old morde? I know he was one of a kind but im looking for the closest i can get.\n\nEdit: I've given up on this thread. I have gotten a SINGLE actual response and other than that it was just people insulting me for liking old morde. I wish people would actually answer my question instead of just wasting my time.","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2019-10-27T01:52:23.337+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=who+is+the+most+bugged+champion+in+League+right+now%3F","replies":[{"poster":"ProdigiousFlow","date":"2019-10-27T01:59:13.830+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i love when i have a serious question and the only responses i get are things like this","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2019-10-27T02:03:32.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey, the joke was too easy to pass up. :P\n\nHonestly?
