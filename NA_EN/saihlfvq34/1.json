Everytime you get your secondary pick and play it you will receive some points and when you get 100 points you can use them to choose any pick you want for a game. You also lose points when you dodge games. This would be really beneficial I think and could also be a way to help promote the roles that are played less like support by giving more points to people who choose the less desired roles as a secondary pick.","replies":[{"poster":"B1naryB0t","date":"2016-02-16T15:54:59.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, I think that would be really hard to do from a designer's perspective, but so far I'm 13 for 13 on games where I select JG/Supp and get supp. So that would be very easy.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"High5","date":"2016-02-16T02:38:57.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not a bad idea.

What the fuck else do you guys want? A free climb to platinum? Sorry, but the fact of the matter is, half of all players in League of Legends are at Silver IV or below. That means if you are Silver III or higher, CONGRATULATIONS! You are in the upper half of all players. This isn't PokÃ©mon. You can't be the very best like no one ever was. In fact, if you can't climb even with the new promo conditions, then you don't deserve to climb. Period. **Get better.** And be happy that Riot has reduced the number of roles required to play ranked from 4-5 down to 2. If you can't play two fucking roles then you don't deserve to win your promos.  \n\nSeriously. Get good at two non-permabanned champs. That's it. That's all is required to climb now.  \n\nAnd oh no! I rustled your jimmies! Got your panties in a bunch? Too fuckin bad, you think pro players are pansies who climbed to challenger by asking Riot for an easier climb? Not even close.

Sure, some of them consider themselves better at one role than another, but they make sure that their other roles are not drastically behind. If you can't play the game itself at the level you think you are at, then you shouldn't be where you are. I'm not saying you should be only ranked as high as your worst role--rather, it's quite reasonable to ask a player to be proficient enough in two roles to deserve being where they are at right now. It used to be 4 or 5. Be glad Riot changed it to 2.  \n\nThat said, what I said is very true. If you were more confident in your own champion pool, then some \"inconsistency\" in gameplay wouldn't shake you. You would know that in a bigger picture, you will end up climbing regardless of some minor setbacks (I'm talking over dozens of games). If you are getting discouraged just because you lost one or two promos, then you are doing things wrong. If you are losing more than that... well, that's why Riot gave you the free promo win.
