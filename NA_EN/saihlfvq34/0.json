Problematically, the player size on the PBE is very small, so matchmaking making testing for balance an almost futile affair.

Honestly, while I may not like the content creators that use the PBE as a source of new material and little else, I can also recognize that they serve a vital function in hyping up new content so that Riot doesn't look tacky for doing more than a little of it themselves.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
