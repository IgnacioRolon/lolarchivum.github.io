But this new change to level 3 units really hurts my experience. It takes so much of the skill out of the game and just adds more rng to it. I've lost several games to players who run little to no synergies but just have 2 3 star units. I appreciate that the design team want 3 stars to feel impactful but i feel like this is bit too much. From the 40-50 games I've played  or watched it seems like if you get 2-3 stars you are guaranteed a top 4, and if you happen to get 2-3 3 stars you got a top 2 finish easy. I would hope designers have some data to prove this because its really obvious. Please revert so i can use some skill instead of praying for rng in my store. Thanks for the reading the rant.","replies":[{"poster":"ImGoingScotty","date":"2019-11-25T01:13:12.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had like 4 different synergies and 3 2 stars and got stomped by people with just 2 synergies and a 3 star","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sanitarium33","date":"2019-11-24T10:24:35.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a player who tested this I'd have to say it can get you a top 4, maybe 3 sometimes, but every once in a while you get trashed to a 6th spot even with 5 3 stars, so overall I'd say a top 4 with occasional setbacks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Toolmaker","date":"2019-11-23T18:42:47.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Synergies are still more important. A lot of the synergies can make 3 star units ineffective, things like Summoner, Cloud, Glacial, Inferno. Poison. And some other cc champions can just destroy your composition, like Olaf+ Glacial + Berserker.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wasabi Kitty","date":"2019-11-23T06:52:51.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After the patch nerfing them, low cost units don't feel that strong as a 3 star. They definitely help, especially early, but without synergies, items, and a decent comp, they're not going to carry you to a win or even a top 4. \n\n\nI actually played a round a few days ago where some guy in the game decided that he didn't care about synergies, or levels, or anything, except getting 3 stars. He got a 3 star Kog, Warwick, Skarner, and Rek'sai. He finished in 5th place at level 6 because he was going up against people who were level 8, which meant they got an extra 2 units, and his only synergy was predator, while his opponents had multiple. Hell i had a game where I got 3 star Zyra and Diana very early, and still got completely wrecked, finishing 6th. \n\nNow 3 star version of 4+ gold units are completely insane, and they're supposed to be. They're extremely difficult to get and just one other player going for the same units completely locks you out of getting them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-11-23T05:20:06.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That was one of the most cordial and well-expressed rants I've ever read on the entire internet.

It takes so long to take a three star down, so long. Especially if you got unlucky with items so your team can't just AS spam or Ult spam. \n\nSo if they have multiple three starts they basically have multiple damage sponges, guess I'm fucked then. Three star plus Warmogs or Bloodthirster is pure cancer.","replies":[]}]}
