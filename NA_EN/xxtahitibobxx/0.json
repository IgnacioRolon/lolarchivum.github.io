This post is just to discuss about riot ban bot and see if there is (or not) a problem in it.\r\n\r\nThe party just started and Darius top got a kill early by countering an invade. Hecarim was doing really good, especially for his first time and i had no problem to fight the enemy Twisted fate with my Malzahar (press R to kill lol).\r\n\r\nBut suddenly the we can see DOUBLE KILL bot for the enemy kai sa and senna. No big deal, you have the right to be bad or to be against someone stronger. But out of nowhere the Rackan start throwing and int because \"his add is bad\". And so he start trolling by giving 3 kills to the enemy TF (going his undertaker and dancing). I then asked him to stop but he started to said i was a trash gold player with a noob champ. We then have one of those \"monkey argument\" moment and i said \"kys\" just before muting him. We then managed to win and agreed to 9 report the Rackan. Bur here i open my game and i see that I WAS PUNISHED FOR SAYING \"KYS\" (and checked to see that he was not punished for intentional feeding or insulting either). I then lost my Honor 4,3 honor (of course just before getting the honor 5) and got chat restricted.\r\n\r\nSo BASICALLY riot is saying us that inning and trolling while provoking people is ok, but OMG YOU SAID KYS YOU SON OF A DEER HOW DARE YOU ???? Could they at least give the job to real humans and not bot ????\r\n\r\nHere is the \"proof\" of my toxicity\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: wp\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: lol lee bad reflex\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: no\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: report rakan int\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: lol hec\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: wp tf\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: it ok\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: you did what you could\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: but please everybody report rackan for intentional feeding\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: thx\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: cause hios lane phase is ruined so he throw\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: not like our darius is doing great and our hecarim is fed\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: adc main in a nutshell\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: let just report both of them\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: wp tf\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: that was a realy nice ult\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: coming from the inting rackan that gave the enemy mid 2 kills\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: mb sorry\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: stfu trash and quit\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: you're the main reason of our loss\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: yeah now he feed the senna and said i'm the troll\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: $\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: at least i'm not the bronze trash here\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: muted\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: kys\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: i can beat anyone of them\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: take objectives\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: darius for the win boys\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: shad noxus vs virgin demacia\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: DRAKE FAST\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: WP\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: rackan useless once more\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: sad\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: she have 40 cs dud\r\nxXTahitiBobXx: gwp","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-12-23T21:01:58.932+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, wow, hmm, maybe you shouldn't have told someone to kill themselves.

Instead you called for Reports on your Allied Rakan and you spent a good portion of the game arguing with him.\n\n**What that Rakan did was wrong, no question about it.** However you should not have fought over it with him in Chat. If someone's going to act that way, actually ask for them to stop. Otherwise mute them &amp; play the best you can with the cards dealt. \n\nWhen it comes down to reports, all it takes is one report (so there's no need to call for x9 reports). It also takes massive restraint to not fire back at turds like that, but in the end it's not worth losing your account over.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2019-12-24T02:27:11.156+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol yes, Riot is telling you that trolling and inting is okay because you got punished. /s","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yin Yang Taoist","date":"2019-12-23T21:15:50.696+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't be saying ZT words. Not only that, even if you didn't say that you'd still be getting CR's if these landed on the Specialist's desk. Because calling someone trash, stfu among other things results in one. You have to keep in mind that that it doesn't matter if the person you responded to was flaming/griefing or inting. That's how the current system works. So aside from ZT words, don't talk at all. Because I'm certain that you got a 14-day suspension at the very least. Next one is a perma. and to avoid that, its best not to even use chat for someone in your spot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MotherKaiser","date":"2019-12-23T22:59:11.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"¨xXTahitiBobXx: kys¨\n\nThis, and only this by its self, is already a reason to perma ban you.","replies":[]}]}
