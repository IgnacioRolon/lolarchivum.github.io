When somebody is spam pinging, you're forced to mute pings from everyone in the team instead of just the asshat who's doing it. That breaks down communication even more. \n\n>if they brought it back, they would also need to bring back \"refusing to communicate\" as a report option\n\nIf they keep it, they have to add \"spamming pings\" as a report option, and actually act on it with zero tolerance instead of being a placebo option like the \"failure to communicate\" was. I'll take \"kys\" and whatever hate speech they want, it doesn't phase me at all. Some of it is even funny. But I'll  be dammed if pings don't tilt the hell out of me.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"fatherdarius","date":"2017-03-12T03:03:53.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your brain is more powerful than their mouse button.
