I can't predict 40 minutes of 100% stable, low ping with no spikes, which is apparently a requirement to play League now.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\"attempting to reconnect forever\" bug. Small 1-2 second lagspike with zero packet loss forces the \"attempting to reconnect\" message (this would not have happened before 4.17). This message never goes away, even though my lag was gone before it even popped up. It's too bad this wasn’t fixed in 4.18. All 4.18 seems to have fixed is the loading-screen bugsplats afterward, but I’ll still disconnect from the game from even the smallest lagspike and be forced to close it and reopen it. People are STILL getting leaverbusted for it. Thousands of people.\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce:\r\n\r\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/kuAdIpiU-crash-how-to-reproduce-the-attempting-to-reconnect-bug-almost-100-mac-but-win-7-has-it-too\r\n\r\nMega-thread with people complaining about bug:\r\n\r\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/yqoW9sHe-horrible-attempting-to-reconnect-bug-417\r\n\r\nExample of small lagspike that will disconnect me from the game forever (until I close it and reopen it):\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Z1kkcMR.png","replies":[]}
