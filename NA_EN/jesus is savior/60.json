These same people, if they are bruisers, usually build Triforce as well (eg: Udyr).\r\n\r\nFrozen Heart gives zero hp. Triforce gives a measly 250hp. So tanks/bruisers who build both are missing out on a ton of HP by having these 2 items take up their inventory slots.\r\n\r\nNow enter Black Cleaver. It gives 20% CDR and 400 hp. And not building a Frozen Heart opens you up to another HP item. For comparison purposes, lets use Randuin's Omen (even though you were probably building it anyway) and slight rune modifications (if you think this comparison is bad, remember - it's gold efficient without its passive/active, and nothing is stopping you from building two - I just want to compare items with similar stats).\r\n\r\nSo lets say you're replacing your old Frozen Heart and scaling hp runes (+100 armor &amp; +216 hp at 18) with Randuin's Omen and scaling armor runes (+97 armor &amp; +500 hp at 18). You have a net gain of 284 hp, and a net loss of 3 armor. If you factor in the new black cleaver as a triforce replacement, you're up  434 hp. Factor in cinderhulk, and you're up a total of 542 hp, and losing a measly 3 armor.\r\n\r\nBut not only are you up 542 hp, you also have more options: for example, you can now build thornmail without sacrificing health at all, because you're not forced to build another zero hp item (frozen heart) every game. So if an enemy ADC gets fed, you can counter their massive lifesteal AND still have tons of health.\r\n\r\nYou also have a better powerspike: on someone like Udyr, you no longer need to rush a defensive item to get your cooldowns low enough to play the champion properly. You are rushing an offensive/defensive hybrid item that will help with your cooldowns AND damage.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of options: you still want a sheen item? Get iceborne gauntlet. Now you can have the rage passive AND the slowing field (you could before as well, but it was kind of a huge waste).\r\n\r\nOh, and something you may not have noticed? The rage passive on Black Cleaver is actually superior to Triforce. It proc's on PHYSICAL DAMAGE, not basic attacks. So, let's look again at Udyr. You land a tiger strike, which is a 2 second DoT. This means you gain 20 movement speed for 4 seconds instead of 2 seconds. Or Zed, Talon, Pantheon? You can proc the rage passive from range. Heck on someone like Zed, it will help his clutch LC$BIGPLAYS and clutch mobility, because the detonation of his death mark (which happens when he's probably already running away and trying to exit the fight) will proc it. Oh it also grants the 60 movespeed on assists. Triforce only grants it on kills. Hue.\r\n\r\nThe one downside is that you will be missing out on that juicy 8% movespeed that Triforce offers. And if that really bothers you? Get the IBG and make up for it with a 30% slow.\r\n\r\n#**tl;dr this item is going to be completely broken and Riot really shouldn't release it at all**\r\n\r\n[](http://i.imgur.com/SaWnk0o.png)","replies":[]}
