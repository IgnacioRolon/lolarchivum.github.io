The stronger mid laners in my opinion are at the moment ahri, lux, zed.\nConsidering I play veigar because I like mid/late game hyper-scaling, I get poked so much from ahri. It is a mage with a strong CC but at the same time it is a skillshot, she feels not over powered in sense of balance but her utility/damage kit is strong, talon is strong too but falls off quickly and its a wasted slot if he is not getting fed early.\nI personally like unique kits like \nsinged, \njhin (he is a ranged assassin and not adc, he gives the impression that he is OP yet he needs help), \nazir (well... yeah we need to look into that more),\ngraves (very strong but if bullets get tanked he gets denied), \nLeblanc (sorta fun to play), \nPoppy (needs some help as well, unique yet situation-ally strong, more of a counter champion).\nKassadin (unique way to be a mage K-assassin using an enhanced blade, blinking around is fun and now more balanced...oh season 1... )\nTo sum up some champions need help, like Vladimir to feel more enjoyable to play, essentially you press 2 buttons all the time and either get kills and HP or stay around and wait for a kill or dive and die. I like the concept of Aoe damage in team fights when using a mage, now he may be a bit tankier than other mages (3000hp with full ap build average) but he feels like the old poppy. I like the fact that he plays TOP and Mid though, I also like the concept of infinite sustain and use Hp management to do damage, I know he is not a vampire but a blood-Bender though I would like to see a vampire character arise from the lore, I know its cliche but some people actually like this.\nAlso Azir feels not so easy to play when playing casually or ranked, it is not an easy champion to use but at the same time it punishes players that attempt to master him from early on even with experience in the game and in league. Aatrox is the same way, for example I can play yasuo but I cannot play Aatrox or Azir but I like them both and the result is a harsh game and very punishing. So you end up farming and waiting for items to keep you intact.\nAn idea I have for Singed this time is his poison damage should scale off max% Hp per 5 sec (stacking/refreshing the longer you stay in poison) and remove the Ap scale. This for making him a champion that the longer you stay near him the worse it becomes. But this is a balance if you think about it, tanks tend to buy MR so they will take less damage and Low hp champions like lux will take a fixed value of damage. So basically the poison will sort of balance the Hp bars of the opponents, you do the math of course. He could have a %magic pen passive on his ult to do damage to tanks too of course. This champion for some reason is one that in every game I see feeds the enemies and laughs like a maniac but he feels unique and creates a hidden rule in the game (Never...ever chase singed), he is only annoying though and skill lever impacts what he can do and how good he is as a champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dyabolic","date":"2016-02-17T21:19:12.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=06deWs4s,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-02-17T08:22:50.134+0000)\n>\n> On one hand we are hitting three things that will impact Udyr in a single patch.\n> \n> On the other hand Udyr's significantly out of line and the individual changes are all quite small:\n> \n> * 3% less MS on Runic Echoes\n> * 5 less shield/damage per rank on Turtle and Phoenix\n> * 5 less MS on Boots of Swiftness\n> \n> If those changes are enough to take Udyr from one of the strongest champs in the game in solo queue to a terrible state then we must be in a situation where everything's so balanced even tiny changes have monumental impacts.

In order for your numbers to be correct, you'd have to be fighting for more than 35 seconds per skirmish.\n> \n> Even then, you have to take into account that Udyr is not going to be taking damage every time that he as his turtle stance up.    Let's take Trick2G for example, he can go in, stun, do a bunch of damage and get out.  Often times what he will do is go back in once he has his passive stacked fully, and if your trying to stack your passive, you aren't missing out on any extra HP.\n> \n> I think a more realistic number of the HP that you would no longer be getting would be around 80 - 100 which is still less than a ruby crystal.\n\nA nice drawn out chase -- usually through 2 sets of turrets -- can last 30+ seconds. Udyr is a tank/bruiser, not an assassin. He tries to slowly slap people to death while being an unkillable menace.","replies":[{"poster":"Awkward Couch","date":"2016-02-17T09:44:28.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=That Evelynn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=06deWs4s,comment-id=000200000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-02-17T09:31:56.526+0000)\n>\n> A nice drawn out chase -- usually through 2 sets of turrets -- can last 30+ seconds.

Often in a chase like that, you're using turtle to keep your passive up, not to absorb damage.  I still think your 200-400 hp you would no longer be getting is still too high.  This is intended to be a nerf, and it is going to hurt him a bit, but I don't think it will be nearly as much as you think.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"alfavhunter","date":"2016-02-17T02:31:48.735+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"The item changes (specifically the new AP jungle item) were huge buffs to his power\n\nSure certain build paths didn't get much, but some of them got good to great buffs with item and mastery changes","replies":[{"poster":"Jesus is Savior","date":"2016-02-17T02:33:29.788+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=alfavhunter,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=06deWs4s,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-02-17T02:31:48.735+0000)\n>\n> The item changes (specifically the new AP jungle item) were huge buffs to his power\n> \n> Sure certain build paths didn't get much, but some of them got good to great buffs with item and mastery changes\n\nAnd now they're nerfing both the items AND the champion, in usual Riot style.","replies":[{"poster":"alfavhunter","date":"2016-02-17T02:35:21.448+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"I know\n\nI used to play Sion and sij\n\nIt's just a repeat of the same thing\n\nNerf champion\n\nNerf item that broke champion\n\nChampion rots","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Yamazuki","date":"2016-02-17T15:32:58.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=alfavhunter,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=06deWs4s,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2016-02-17T02:35:21.448+0000)\n>\n> I know\n> \n> I used to play Sion and sij\n> \n> It's just a repeat of the same thing\n> \n> Nerf champion\n> \n> Nerf item that broke champion\n> \n> Champion rots\n\nSej isn't even bad.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2016-02-17T03:02:23.488+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hmm, seems like the pain of Hecarim players:\n\nBalanced in patch 5.23 with exactly 50% win rate jungle and top\n\n1.

He's been balanced for about 3 years (like OP said). Now that the new cookie cutter item is presented, that everybody cries NOT to get nerfed, you instead nerf Udyr himself. This wont have this problem solved, since it's purely the item's fault, and not the Udyr. As for win rate, it's only start of the season, ofc it will be unrealistic percentages still, and cant be taken that seriously.\nWe'll see how it goes.. **My 2 cents is that Runic Echoes is the item to be reworked/hit, and not the champ himself.**","replies":[]}]}
