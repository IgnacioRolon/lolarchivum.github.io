It's also worse for anybody who liked to strategically pick less-counterable roles when they were an early pick, rather than first picking Singed top or something and then going 0/15 just because the enemy team grabbed Darius. It's only really better for people who were incapable of working with their team in champ select and reverted to \"NO NOOB IM FIRST PICK U GO SUPPORT OR I REPORT YOU\" and then wondered why their teammates started trolling them. I could count on _one_ hand the number of legitimate _trolls_ I got last season.\n\nAnd that's not to mention the fact that queue times have skyrocketed. It used to take 5 minutes tops to get into a game for most of the ranked playerbase. Now you'll be sitting in queue for 5+ minutes, probably have to sit through several queue dodges, likely sitting in queue _again_ after said dodges, and then finally getting into a game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DeloricVI","date":"2016-04-06T07:14:48.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why don't you try to play ADC?
