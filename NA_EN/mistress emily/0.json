If you already hit that cap, then you will consistently get an error every single time you try to purchase a rune.  To get this resolved, make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) over to us!  We should be able to clear this up and allow you to purchase whatever new runes you'd like!\n\nlet me know if you have any other questions!","replies":[]}]}
