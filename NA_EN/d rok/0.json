It seems like Riot has entered their lab and locked the door behind them. \r\n\r\nThere seem to be a lot more things entering this game that inherently favour the choosing of a specific champion over decision making as ANY champion.  Champion select in general has never felt more impactful.   And I mean that in a really frustrating way.  This isn&#039;t about winning or losing games.  It&#039;s about Riot seeming to have a disconnect with their own philosophy.  \r\n\r\nTheir philosophy this year has been to create clear champion strengths and weaknesses so that you have a REASON to pick a champion.   But in my experience this year, virtually every reason I have had to pick a champion is because it is inherently overpowered in relation to whatever else is available.  I can honestly say I have never had LESS concern for my team&#039;s overall strategy before in champion select.  It&#039;s all about grabbing the most OP champions right now.  And has been since preseason.  This seems like a serious failure.  \r\n\r\nTo provide an example and to remain topical, a lot of these new mage update items will bring a plethora of balancing issues, the same way the new masteries have.   You&#039;re giving specific and situational passives/actives/items to a large subset of champions.  And they have to end up being balanced around the champion who derives the greatest benefit from them.  But we&#039;re already in a meta that seems to be totally out of control in terms of balancing.  So is Riot just trying to push out a crap-ton of content this year, so they can try to sort it all out next year?   \r\n\r\nIs this whole season just an experiment?  Has Riot got any intention of finding a reasonable balance state this year?   Or is it about transforming their game for season 7?   Because the more I see, the more I feel like a guinea pig in some sort of extended PBE experience. \r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Tokogawaruf","date":"2016-04-07T23:15:52.468+0000","up_votes":73,"down_votes":3,"body":"I hope this sick experiment comes to an end soon.

Mages had a wholesale itemization cost increase nearly, AP was removed from a couple of items too {{item:3025}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3057}} as examples. There were fewer AP items in the game, most were made more expensive. True much of the AD items were made more expensive too, but their build paths were altered to make them built more steadily. Less holding on to big chunks of gold to save up for item components. Mage items are getting that now, but also having a massive overhaul in how the items work.\n\nNow we actually have items that give mana for getting hurt.... the last thing you would want on a mage, but this balance team has shown they kinda like assassins, so AP assassins will be fine with it. IDK, maybe{{champion:79}} {{champion:223}} got together to design the new AP \"get mana from getting hurt\" items.\n\nI really think we have a balance team that only likes marksmen and assassins. The poke, poke, poke, all in burst of mages isnt very flashy either, its hardly LCS big play material. So maybe that has something to do with it.\n\nI just have no faith in their design/balance with all the 60% win rate champs weve had so far. These boards begged them not to let the Xin buffs go through, then they did and he shot up to 60% win rate... Kog buffs, 60% win rate. Maybe Im wrong, maybe theyre geniuses... though the performance so far hasnt reflected it, but in my opinion, this may be a disaster from the balance team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-04-07T23:37:03.690+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I've noticed this trend as well.  Pre-Season changes are always a mess but this year it felt like they changed more than they have in the past.  Add on the Marksmen update and the upcoming mage update and there is way more shit changing in such a short span of time than ever before.  \n\nI feel like the masteries are finally balanced, the marksmen for the most part are where they should be now and the marksmen item changes are also in a good spot now.  \n\nI sort of agree with the OP picks.  I tend to play what I have lots of fun with so I usually don't pick op things.  (I picked up ekko due to the tank ekko trend and have been having so much fun with him.  I prefer to build him ap assassin but if it doesn't work as well as tank then I'm going to go tank in ranked.  Normals I go whatever.)\n\nI still feel like you can climb with anything as long as you are good and have enough game knowledge (honeslty people are so predictable, junglers too)\n\nThe new mage items are going to cause a plethora of problems across the board and riot simply will not be able to properly tune them until they hit live servers due to low sample sizes and human ingenuity to exploit.  \n\nI am against adding more active items in the game, especially ones that give movement (looking at you hextech cannon or whatever its called).  \n\nItem actives have either been generally incosequential like the gunblade active (its a slow sure but you almost never take it in to account when planning a fight) or they are game defining like zhyonas or qss.\n\nIf the enemy has zh or qss then you NEED to play around it. Its something that everyone can build to outplay you and thus you always take it in to account when planning a fight.  Adding mobility to active items when a large magority of the games damage comes from skillshots means everyone gets an extra dash.\n\nIm a little off topic but tldr for the items is generally speaking if you give everyone the same buff then the weak become mediocre and the already strong become way to op.\n\nRight now I would say the game is decent in terms of balance, sure tank items on assasins are still a thing (ekko my boy you gonna get your ratios buffed and tankyness nerfed), and towers are weak (yay the riot post said they looking in to it) but its not kogmaw, yi, xin release state broken.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, I really hope after the mage update dust settles (riot fix it in one month after release tops pls) then we are going to be smooth sailing till the end of the season.\n\nJust my two cents.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2016-04-07T23:56:25.696+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"i honestly have no faith that they will fix it next year...they don´t really seem to be aware what they already broke and what´s dirly in need of fixing in the first place.

The marksmen got access to more crit and lifesteal at no real cost, the end of last season gave juggernauts/tanks purchasable mobility + steraks which has only recently been nerfed, while mages will have less mana regen + less AP at the benefit of some fancy utility and a little CDR (which won't mean as much with less mana regen).\n\nMarksmen now will **need** to be burst down by a mage's combo mid-late game otherwise they will use their exclusively purchasable sustain to be full health by the time your abilities are back up again. Let's not also forget the fact that abilities can miss where auto attacks won't, so mages' damage is less reliable, less potent, and whittling people down is a less viable option because of AD champs' sustain, on top of the class' inherent benefits of being able to take objectives quicker and not having their damage tied to cooldown windows as well.\n\nSo my hopes at this point are that the rework team doesn't redo what they did with the juggernaut update/marksmen update and leave there being a few elite reworks, a few underpowered reworks, and have them flip-flop from patch to patch for multiple patches. Let's hope that the item balance doesn't become as drawn out as the nerfs to Deadman's Plate + Steraks + Sated Devourer were. If any masteries get added along with the mage update, let's hope it's not a repeat of the 10 Thunderlord meta. Let's also hope that with this update no champ can build full tank and still have enough damage/utility to be able to take on multiple champs at once unless significantly fed.\n\nI gotta do my placement matches at some point this season, but the game is all over the place this season so I might not have any windows of 'good enough' balance to play them in.","replies":[{"poster":"D rok","date":"2016-04-08T17:16:26.101+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really well stated.

Riots motto in the boardroom must be  \"More is better\".

Riot needs to understand that they have already established themselves in the gaming world and that new content isn't exactly what's needed. Remaking characters that need it should be higher on the list; at least higher than developing new characters. When an old character is re-done I already feel like it's a brand new character, and it appeases the part of me that really wanted the new content.\n\nI can only assume the balance team is yelling \"SLOW.THE.FUCK.DOWN\" when the developers are just running around with all these ideas. It also feels like the departments within Riot are so out of touch with eachother. Balance teams making changes to champs when items are what needs to be balanced. New items being developed to fill holes in champs that actually just need small re-designs; causing new said items to break other champs that were in a decent balance spot, and the circle continues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GhastlyGhoulMan","date":"2016-04-08T05:53:36.366+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel like Riot's efforts at making everyone unique and powerful in their niche will just eventually lead to power creep, and everyone will be super.\n\nhttp://orig01.deviantart.net/38aa/f/2013/140/9/7/cliff_by_fragmented_shadows-d65zl0q.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rockm Sockm","date":"2016-04-08T02:56:07.050+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Riot stated numerous tims once the items are in place...they will balance the champios kits around them.\n\nThat was the whole point of te new assassin item.","replies":[{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2016-04-08T05:29:21.115+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rockm Sockm,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VjuF6a5V,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2016-04-08T02:56:07.050+0000)\n>\n> Riot stated numerous tims once the items are in place...they will balance the champios kits around them.\n> \n> That was the whole point of te new assassin item.\n\nand they have done nothing of the sort... hell the new assassin item is absolute garbage right now but if you try to buff it it'll just end up being broken so... yeah","replies":[{"poster":"paisy","date":"2016-04-08T15:24:35.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Remember when people thought it was gonna be OP?

The item is fundamentally flawed.   If it's buffed in any substantial way, it WILL be op.  It's just broken.  It's the same with a lot of these actives on the new AP items.   Look how long it took them to realize frost queen needed a nerf...  and that was pretty obvious.  I'm a little frustrated with them adding new items, and then balancing the game around them, rather than just adding reasonably balanced items.  It was the same deal with masteries this season.","replies":[{"poster":"Olga Rajecka","date":"2016-04-08T21:34:00.570+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is - Champion shouldn`t complement the item. The item should complement the champion.\n\nImagine a world where Duskblade gets nerfed into the ground because Quinn is destroying everyone with it. They nerf the Duskblade, but hey, they`ve balanced every ad assassin around the item. Result - all ad assassins, except Quinn, get butchered. It`s the same thing with Yi and Devourer / Rageblade. They nerfed Yi (who isn`t the only abuser )  when they should`ve just nerfed the item and plethora of AS / AD junglers would be balanced.\n\nWhy not just balance each champion accordingly and THEN add the item value that way every champion is inherently balanced and items just improve those values.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rakvir","date":"2016-04-08T08:10:55.196+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know about anyone else but I'm still pretty pissy about the passive buffs minions get while you're ahead.\n\nYes, theoretically, minions pushing harder into you means safer to farm but in reality, you can't clear them quickly enough to avoid significant turret damage and it allows the enemy to dive you MUCH more effectively.\n\nEverything else on top of that is just insulting, be they champion buffs, itemization being re-worked, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2016-04-08T16:43:49.346+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It also means that when the minions hit your tower, it goes down faster.
