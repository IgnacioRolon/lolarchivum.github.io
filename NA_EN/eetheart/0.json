After that, Mouse 4 and 5 buttons stopped working in League of Legends (and ONLY in League of Legends). Works fine in other programs and games.\n\nAny idea why this is? I realize this might be a Windows-specific issue, but it IS quite annoying not being able to use the ping-shortcuts that I'm used to.\n\nI found a similar thread over on the EUW boards, so I know it's not an issue only for me. (https://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-en/7sijdqWI-rival-300-side-buttons-not-assigning-in-game-since-windows-10-update?show=new)\n\nIf anyone has a solution, please enlighten us!\n**\nUPDATE: We have several solutions posted here!

There is a tool called \"Logitech Setpoint\" (possibly, there are similar tools for other manufacturers). In this tool you can define customized keyboard-shotcuts instead of the standard functions of the mouse buttons.\nFor example: I change Button 4 from \"forward\" to \"Ctrl+D\" and Button 5 from \"backward\" to \"Ctrl+F\". As soon, as I did this, the league client (also ingame) accepted the buttons, and I could re-assign them and my problem is solved.\n\nBy the way: in the setpoint tool, you can also do that just seperate for certain applications, so the main forward/backward - function in browsers etc. can stay.

The buttons that I am trying to get to work are the buttons on the **side** of my mouse, the ones that usually serve to navigate (back and forward) in a typical Internet browser. My left and right  (typically called Mouse 1 and Mouse 2) buttons work fine, and they do not need to be rebound.\n\nWhat's more is that those affected buttons are **already** bound in the game and were working, prior to the Windows Creator Update - but they no longer work, not even in the Client. I do use the new client, but even then I had no problems with the mouse buttons just a week ago.\nI can confirm that it's not only with a specific mouse, it's with every mouse that I test with.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-16T21:45:58.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"I noticed which mouse buttons you were referring to in the title of your post, I was simply using the mouse button 1 as an example as to why we don't allow certain buttons to be rebound. \n\nSince you also mentioned that you had upgraded to the _Creator Update_, that would explain why your previous keybinds were reset, as you switched OS versions.

My advice would be to revert back to before the Creator's Upgrade. Unless you absolutely need it, you're better off without it, at least until Microsoft patches the crap out their buggy update.

Dang. That sucks.\nAlternatively, you could do a Windows refresh (or reset?) to go back. I'm not sure if that would work, but it would mean reinstalling and reconfiguring everything you have, which sucks. You'd still keep your files, but your registry would be blank and your installed stuff would need to be installed again, at least some of it.","replies":[{"poster":"d0nut","date":"2017-05-07T08:50:34.679+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did the reset.
