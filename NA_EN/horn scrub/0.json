I'm assuming that getting to 30 will place you against other 30s and there's going to be this huge difficulty spike (but I'm not sure, plz correct me if I'm wrong). I'm worried that now I'm going to be expected to have a lot of skill, and I hate letting my team down like that.  I definitely need more experience, and  a smurf sounds perfect to help me hone my skills against players that are tbh my skill level.  Unless there's a realistic bot difficulty then AuuU**U** I'm just going to do terrible I bet.  Please tell me if there is a difficulty spike.","replies":[{"poster":"Sona Ping","date":"2015-04-18T04:35:05.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I'm assuming that getting to 30 will place you against other 30s\"\nIt should happen more often, yes.  But you would not necessarily always get 30s in a game, depending on your play level, whose available, etc.\n\n\"and there's going to be this huge difficulty spike \"\nAgain, not necessarily.  The matches would be made with your MMR and you would be matched against players that should give both teams roughly equal chances to win.\n\n\" Does Riot discourage smurfs a lot a lot? \"\nFrom the FAQ\n>How does Riot feel about smurfs?\n>\n>Riot does not officially condemn or condone smurfing. We understand the cases where players make new accounts in order to help teach new players the game, but are working on newer systems to provide a similar experience in a more positive way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"General Elephant","date":"2015-04-18T04:33:19.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"generally speaking, smurfing is only an issue while reaching lvl 30, after that, regular players farm normals until they reach a comfort level that they can go into ranked, generally knowing all the roles (might not be great at all 5, but can play and not feed) and have atleast 2 champs in each role they are comfortable with, and 2-3 full runepages.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Phife","date":"2015-04-18T04:23:34.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you wanna practice just normals...

Just play, build your runes, watch twitch, learn the game, have fun, ignore ragers (All in normals though, don't start ranked) You'll get it. Who cares if you don't do well.\n\nFeel free to add me in game and I can definitely give you some tips if you would like. ","replies":[]}]}
