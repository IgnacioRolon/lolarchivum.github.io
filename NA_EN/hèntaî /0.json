What happens if you log onto the legacy client?\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nLet me know so I can get a better understanding of what's going on.

I tried logging off and force shutting everything and when I reopened it wouldnt let me connect back into the game nor did it relaunch the game. It took 5 attempts of force quitting and relogging until it finally came up and when I loaded in it was already too late.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-12T00:56:53.792+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might have an unstable connection trying to reach the game servers, since you were able to finally make it in.
