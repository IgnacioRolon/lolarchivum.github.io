The first is the use of third party programs that don't interact well with league, so remove any you might have like play.tv.  You might also have a network issue that's failing to stay connected and kicking you off, so I suggest going through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to be sure.
