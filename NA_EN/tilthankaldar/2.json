Classy.\n\nWe all know what calling someone a champion main means.  It's derogatory and meant only to belittle anything they say due to a supposed bias toward their champion.\n\nYou were not making a generalization up there.  You were throwing out a blanket accusation in order to belittle what I said.  Nevermind that it had absolute jack shit to do with the content of my post.\n\n\"They\" don't agree on everything.  \"They\" don't always try to defend their champion from criticism.  Most importantly \"they\" don't all say \"What makes you think correcting someone who is wrong is anger?\".  That is not a phrase that is stereotypically bound to Yasuo mains.  Neither is pointing out that an OP is ignoring facts and acting happy for no real reason.\n\nAs I said before you lost your right to tell me to sit down when you got caught making up nonsense.  No amount of trying to explain it away will cover that up.  We all understand how those phrases actually work, so if you don't like it you can simply stop replying.  It's not like this thread is going to last a while anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"1 800 Top Lane","date":"2016-08-03T23:39:40.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Do you understand what the internet is?","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2016-08-04T00:03:30.944+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you understand that you got wrecked?

It is true they want to not have the tank build with yas like they did with ekko and now Akali. What they want to do is make him more damage like he is built to do.  Talks if maybe making that work is lowering his q damage.  At this point it is true he us being looked at by riot in upcoming patches but nothing is set in stone or fully released yet. On the other hand you also should take in mind that Yas has always been a challenge to balance for riot upon his release. His overall kit makes him hard to balance every time they put any attention on him. So saying I am sure something will be addressed to Yas but what? Even if so it us Yas and he will always find that build to punish you.","replies":[]}]}
