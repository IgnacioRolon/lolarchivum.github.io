Not usually, anyway. Now, you can 1v1 almost anything when you hit full build... except for other full build carries. Their DPS is too high, and if you're building tanky, then your own damage isn't comparable, you can't lifesteal as effectively, and you can't optimize your split damage penetration. Then there are other factors that get in the way, such as your transformation and low AA range.\n\nThere aren't enough item slots to make that viable, yo. You can't take and also put out carry-level damage. Best case scenario? You build Cleaver, Randuin's, Sunfire/Deadman's, Zerker boots, BT, and probably Mortal Reminder. Maybe you'll be able to 1v1 that way. Maybe.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reikken","date":"2016-08-11T06:18:12.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"depends on the ADC\nbut Nautilus is a good one.
