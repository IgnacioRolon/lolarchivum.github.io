It would be nice if you could tell us what is planned (if you can get the information).  The new client have been enforced on us few week ago, so Legacy client is no more an alternative option to do that. :(  after almost a year of the new client arrival, would be nice to know.  THanks a lot.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lew","date":"2017-01-22T23:37:31.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chat rooms aren't implemented into the new client yet so you have to switch back to the legacy client.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheSolas","date":"2017-04-07T10:22:35.792+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]}]}
