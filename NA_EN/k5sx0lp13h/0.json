In both cases as soon as the game was suppose to begin I was never connected to the load screen and it took anywhere from 5 to 15 client restarts to function properly. The 2nd time it happened, i was back IN THE GAME, and the vote happened while I was buying items. \r\nHow is this fair to my team OR me?\r\n\r\nI filed a ticket as well about this issue and RITO have been completely quiet there as to why the game randomly decides to lock me out of connecting to the loading screen and game servers.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-03T18:55:35.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The /Remake system marks anyone who is inactive for 90 seconds or more during the first 3 minutes of the match. At 3 minutes, if anyone was marked, a remake will become available and a vote will take place if enacted. If the vote passes, all players marked by the system will receive a penalty for causing the remake.\n\nRegardless of intent, a disconnection negatively impacts everyone in the match. This is why all disconnections are treated equally by the system and why penalties cannot be modified or removed. I encourage you to check out our [/Remake FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ) for complete details on the system.\n\nIf you can give me some more details as to what behavior you saw or error messages you received when trying to launch into the match, we can work towards resolving this together.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kagepaladin","date":"2016-10-03T17:00:57.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea i had a match the one time where i spawned in my champ walked to center of the fountain i didnt think anything of it, bought my items and left base for mid the riven refused to go top and went mid so i asked her to go to her lane she said no so i went top and she died to lissy first blood, then we got the option to /remake which passed 2 votes for it and 3 votes against it, then in post game lobby i was the one that lost lp.","replies":[]}]}
