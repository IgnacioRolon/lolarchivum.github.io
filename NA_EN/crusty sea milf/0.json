I personally love the Battle for Freljord one, and every time I encounter it I focus the enemy Ashe and nothing else to get that crown. The quests and passives are great, but I wish something a little extra would be added to them once you get out of game.\r\nFor example, if Rengar kills Kha'Zix first he gets the \"Head of Kha'Zix\" summoner icon (creepy passive face). Or, whichever queen kills the other first they get their tribe summoner icon along with an ice crown in the middle of it. Or maybe a banner. Something to spruce up the game and make quests more fun for everyone. It'd be in PvP of course, between two humans  ( don't feed and then kill Ashe bot mercilessly).\r\n\r\nTL;DR - In addition to the in game buffs that come along with secondary quests and hidden passives, if you happen to compete the quest successfully you get something to show off out of game like a summoner icon or banner. PvP only.","replies":[{"poster":"Leona is Waifu","date":"2014-12-15T03:54:57.793+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is, they'd probably have to get quite a bit harder to warrant anything else than a summoner icon. The Cait/Vi/Jinx one isn't hard to get whatsoever. Not that I dislike the idea, I really like it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenLeSpoink","date":"2014-12-15T18:01:14.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want them more than anything make an interaction with Darius/Draven.\nBlood Brothers: The warriors of Noxus are heading towards the battlefield ready to spill blood!\nEffect: Whenever Darius and Draven hit the same target, they both gain +1 gold ( activates 15 seconds once every target champ)","replies":[{"poster":"Destabilizator","date":"2014-12-16T06:33:25.738+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should peptalk themselves as well!

You don't want to incentivise players to do anything other than winnning with out-of-game rewards. The Rengar-Kha'Zix quest works because you get in-game rewards that actually help you win(full stacks for Rengar, 4th evo point for Kha).","replies":[]}]}
