He builds pure tank, has decent damage output if he can land his Q, and can allow some early objective captures really early.\r\n\r\nIn a game I was just in we had a 21 minute Baron, had spirit visage and sunfire cape with merc boots and just sat in the center of baron while my team dps'd it. Needless to say the enemy team surrendered soon after.\r\n\r\nWhy no love for mundo top. I hear about Riven this, Gnar that, Fiora this, Darius that.","replies":[]}
