Owned or not owned, the practice tool should live up to its name. There are champions I've spent IP on that I ended up hating and had I been able to try them out in the practice tool I wouldn't have bought them.\r\n\r\nThat's all. I know some people will say just download the PBE. A lot of people don't have the space for that. Needing 2 separate versions of the game installed to test champions seems a bit much.","replies":[]}
