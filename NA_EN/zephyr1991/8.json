Who the hell thought his kit was a good idea? He's meterless, gets a very low cooldown spamable projectile that marks and slows and goes through enemies, movement speed buffs, attack speed buffs, a hop that can clear large distances, and a second form that increased HP, armor and mr 2x his level, bonus AD, large scaling on AD and AP,  a ranged slow, a stun, a knockback that can wlal stun, and another hop that can bounce twice and slow.\r\n\r\nHis auto attack range is also outside tower range to free harass for days if you want to last hit under tower. And the mark does bonus magic damage off your max health if you get hit 3 times.\r\n\r\nLiterally cancer.","replies":[]}
