Saving to a USB or external drive will constantly force the patcher to download new game files every time you launch it, and only keep them temporarily.

The large update is likely the result of corrupt game files or the patcher failing to find your game files (due to permissions), and attempting to create new ones.  Without proper permissions, it will likely try and update again until resolved.","replies":[{"poster":"Sleepy Winter","date":"2017-07-26T17:56:57.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The prkblem dont have to be from my pc dude idc any more am quitting","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sleepy Winter","date":"2017-07-26T17:23:25.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what am supposed to do bro i ve never encountered tgis kinda stuff in the old client and problem seems to be in both my pc's ....
