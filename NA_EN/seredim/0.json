Your teammate is responsible for theirs.\n\nLet's try that scenario with a slightly different response:\n\nYour teammate complains about not getting a leash.  You mute him.  You no longer see *his* toxic behavior and can focus on winning your lane.  Maybe he starts complaining in /all chat, but your opponents are more likely to think \"What a jerk\" about his comments and report him (not you), especially if they see no response to it from you.\n\nHe tries to report you, but you've muted him and kept your chat clean with everyone else, so the report gets thrown out.  You report him (along with anyone else he's annoyed) and he's the one who will get in trouble.","replies":[{"poster":"Xion The XIV","date":"2017-05-11T11:19:03.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow I never seen someone scream in All chat and your team says, \"What a jerk\". I almost always agree with the Flamer, because 70% of the player base does not mute people.  Tilting is the #2 way to win a game outside of skill. But I can see the point of the OP. I recently had a Yasuo spam KYS in chat and all chat. I think I replied KYS once in chat, and then decided I was better then him and not be toxic to him. I pissed him off more by agreeing with him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"èGirl Nami","date":"2017-05-11T09:36:52.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seredim,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=AxTyeLaP,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-05-10T22:13:46.486+0000)\n>\n> had a little verbal disagreement in game\n\n...\n\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Seredim,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=AxTyeLaP,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-05-10T22:13:46.486+0000)\n>My account has been banned once for 14 days, and I do have some history of toxic behavior, but me and a teammate of mine got into a verbal disagreement, I got mad at him because he started getting toxic with me, and then I get permanently suspended?\n\nwow i wonder why.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Casual Anne","date":"2017-05-10T22:42:06.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are judged on your words when you're reported.
