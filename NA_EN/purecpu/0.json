I still have a massive shop. Its as if it just expanded for no reason. If i change resolutions and then change it back and open shop it will be normal size then next time i open shop it will be massive again. like it forces itself that way.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-10T23:34:46.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info!
