Since both of her abilities that trigger the plants are sorta delayed, they end up getting destroyed before I trigger them. I also have a hard time being aggressive with them because they don&#039;t prioritize champions, so every time they end up hitting minions unless I can safely get close enough to AA the enemy and have my plants focus who I want them to focus on. I&#039;m not really sure on a good way to use her sprouts and place her plants.\r\n\r\nI really like her and would like to be able to use her more often but right now I&#039;m kinda strugglin&#039; so if anyone has some tips that would help I&#039;d appreciate it c:","replies":[{"poster":"khorney","date":"2017-03-07T16:22:10.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"be agressive and get thunderlords and build magic pent flat kind","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erytroxylin","date":"2017-03-07T16:20:46.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Build this shit:\n\n{{item:3116}} {{item:3151}} \n\nCollect freelo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-03-07T16:17:37.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For your W plants place them either right after casting your spell or right before, they are invincible for a short time after you place them so they will have no chance to crush them. Focus more on landing your abilities than growing your plants at first, you can learn about the plants as you learn her.\n\nAlso, don't forget you can cast your spells directly onto the plants as they go to step on them so that they either have to let the plant grow or take the hit.","replies":[]}]}
