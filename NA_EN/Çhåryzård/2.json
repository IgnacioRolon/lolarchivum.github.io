This is a recent problem. I've never had this issue before and my wifi hasn't changed.\r\n\r\nI heard from someone in game the other day too that they were having issues that sounded kinda like mine.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm on a Macbook Pro and it's always run smoothly so I'm not sure if these random \"blips\" where I lag out are game related or wifi related since I've never had this problem, just asking here in case someone has had something similar.\r\n\r\nAlso canceling all sound may help the problem a little bit..I've noticed when I do that it runs smoother longer sometimes but idk if that is just coincidence.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-01T21:48:49.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like you're having some hiccups that may be due to network problems.  Check out this [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to work out these blips and get it fixed up.  Wifi can definitely be a cause of poor connection and causing lag spikes, and there's a step in the guide to try a wired connection to know for sure.
