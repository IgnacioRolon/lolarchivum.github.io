I&#039;m not familiar with Fizz all that much so I&#039;m just wondering where all this damage is coming from if he built a mix of AD and tank..","replies":[{"poster":"Thebiggestpanda","date":"2017-05-17T02:33:55.994+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"His q applies all on-hit effects and 100% of his AD. Its basically an auto attack that turns into a targeted dash with an ap ratio for good measure. His W is an auto attack reset with hefty base damage and good scaling when he lands the active correctly. All of this means that he synergizes quite well with anything that builds out of sheen. He also gets a lot of mileage early game out of dark seal due to his high scalings. Honestly, his kit fits a fighter more than it fits an assassin which means people will build him as such when they can get away with it. \n\nIf you're up for some cheese, Garen works quite well into fizz. The silence screws him over in a big way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-05-17T02:26:10.350+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"its the passive damage on hit from his W\n\nSeastone Trident\n\nPASSIVE: Fizz rends enemies on-hit, and those affected by Chum the Water's lure or shark, dealing them magic damage over 3 seconds, and marking them for 6 seconds.\nTOTAL MAGIC DAMAGE: 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 / 60 (+ 40% AP)\nACTIVE: Fizz's next basic attack deals bonus magic damage.
