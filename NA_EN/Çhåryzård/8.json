She can place as many as she wants as long as she has them to place (like if she has 5, she can place as many of those as she likes up to the max of 5), and they are untargetable. There&#039;s no penalty.\n\nLike invisible traps can be destroyed safely and are revealed under turret. Nids traps deal a little damage but it is up to her if she jumps in and if she does there&#039;s room for counter play. Azir&#039;s soldiers aren&#039;t traps but if I remember right their duration is decreased under turret but cost the same amount of mana to use.\n\nSo why is Cait allowed to completely fill up your turret if she chooses without any penalty? Te only way to get rid of them is walk over them and then she can safely point and click shoot you from a distance. I get that she&#039;s supposed to be oppressive but right now she&#039;s pretty strong and being able to zone you out of turret without any penalty seems a bit too oppressive. Nobody else can do it so why can she?\n\nLike what if she was only allowed to place a few traps under turret? She can place as many as she wants anywhere else but under turret the amount she can put down is reduced. \n\nJg ganks under turrets with lots of traps are also so much easier, seeing as you&#039;ll most likely get snared if you run. \n\n\nIdk, this feels kinda not right to me.

If your jungler cant help bot lane because their jungler is there also, then go get rift herald and focus top. If rift herald is gone and caitlyn and her supp and jungler are bot, Go focus on mid lane.\n\nLiterally the games not that hard. Yeah its frustrating when theres ''5 traps under your tower'' but you crying and complaining instead of taking actual advice i dont know man..\n\nAll i know is if a caitlyn is shoving my bot lane under tower they better have that fuckin shit warded because i will camp them and i will get a double kill with my favorite jungler. {{champion:60}}","replies":[{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2016-07-10T20:39:51.194+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And then what?
