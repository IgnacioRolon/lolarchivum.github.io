Instead, it places down a thinker that deals damage in an AoE around it every x seconds. It's not really difficult at all the see how these are entirely different - Thunderlord's is programmed to only get one stack from DoTs through only getting a single stack from a DoT debuff, but since the pool doesn't function as a debuff it doesn't care and applies a stack with every tic.\n\nThis is actually a very similar situation. Swain Q places down a thinker the deals damage to a single target every x seconds - there's no debuff at all, and therefore it's not a DoT in-code. But it also only hits a single target, and while that target can be switched, a single Beatrice can still only laser a single enemy at a time.\n\nWhen it comes to games, you need to actually break down what's happening in terms like this, as that's how they actually function given that they're all just instructions for a computer and a computer is a very literal thinker. A lot of weird \"exceptions\" come up due to this, but they aren't exceptions at all - the computer's just thinking about what's happening in a different way than you are.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2016-05-15T09:52:50.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not the only bug with Swains Q, I recently got an assist on my own death, using Swains Q :P\nI might try to reproduce it and make a bug report, but letting you guys know is a step in the right direction I guess c:","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2016-05-15T15:43:22.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can confirm, had that happen to me the other day.\n\nI assisted on my own death doing ~300 damage with Decrepify... as Kha'Zix.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"bloodmoth","date":"2016-05-15T04:26:31.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"great! lets upvote this.... naww 70s probably 1 too high ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\nBut seriously good news, i tried out swain support in ranked, figured since zonyas was cheaper and Q is a stronger support spell that it should be at the very least OK, then noticed i got no gold from Q and had to use my E for the rest of laning phase :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"BoilTheOil","date":"2016-05-15T04:14:47.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"meddler more like best riot employee","replies":[]},{"poster":"CurlyFriezzz","date":"2016-05-14T23:22:17.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=p1vumYJs,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2016-05-14T21:32:13.761+0000)\n>\n> Just looked into this and its a good news/bad news situation.
