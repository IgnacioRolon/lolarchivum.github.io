Why is there not an instant feedback between the patcher and the server communicating corrupted files found, that prevent me from relogging? It feels hecka bad to lose tons of lp for something that not only is not my fault, but could also be prevented by a simple instant feedback feature. No reason to punish people at random is there?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-25T19:03:07.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Disconnecting from a match has a negative impact on everyone in it, regardless of the reason for the disconnection.

Issue is Finding corrupted game files directly on game entry. (after load or directly after entering the game). My windows is 100% updated always. so i don't believe that's the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-08T17:54:05.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your installation may be completely borked and a clean reinstallation of League may be necessary. \n\nI recommend grabbing our [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to complete this. Start the app, check the boxes for both **Reinstall** and **clean uninstall**, then allow the process to run for a while. After the reinstallation has finished, launch League to finish patching to complete the process. I strongly recommend installing League to the default directory **(C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends)**.\n\nLet me know if this helped resolve the corruption issues.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2016-07-25T13:13:45.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Repair the game by clicking the question mark icon to the top right of the patcher.
