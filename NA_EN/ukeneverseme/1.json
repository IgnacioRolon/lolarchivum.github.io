Probably not the way to go about it.\n\nThe big thing that bugs me about this is that even these exceptions are consistent. I could be wrong, but i used to play A LOT of {{champion:32}} , and his Q DOES get disabled while Rooted/Grounded. I can't really see a difference in the mobility potential between Bandage Toss and Zenith Blade, you throw it out, don't move and nothing happens if you miss, or you dash to a target (champion only in Leo's case) if it hits. I understand the difference between these abilities and something like {{champion:62}} E, but Bandage Toss and Zenith Blade seem to be functionally identical in this case, and that's the most upsetting part of this situation for me. I totally get the reason {{champion:59}}  can E->Q while snared, I used to abuse it when I played him full AD by intentionally walking into Morg snares and the like just to combo them anyway afterwards, but if even the well understood exception is inconsistent, it's really disheartening for someone like me how truly enjoys figuring out the nuanced mechanics in League.\n\nThis is getting pretty long for just a comment on a boards post, but this issue bleeds into other mechanics as well. My most mastered champion currently is {{champion:240}} , and part of his tooltips are critically and frustratingly misleading. Specifically, his passive supposedly makes him Untargetable. This is at the very least stupidly misleading, and at most flat out false. Untargetablilty, a la Fizz Poll or Vlad Pool, DISJOINTS targeted effects that are in flight, for example Nunu Snowball, Veigar Ult, or Turret Shots. This is important, because with these spells, and most forms of Untargetability, it DOES NOT matter if you are still Untargetable when the spell would've hit you, as it fizzles and becomes ineffectual the moment you become Untargetable. Kles passive, however, does not work this way. Basically, all that happens is that Kled becomes immune to targeted abilities during the brief window while he is dismounting Skarl after he dies, and all targeted spells and attacks traveling towards him continue to do so, and WILL damage him if they land after that window. This is very important for two reasons, the extremely short duration of Kled's Untargetability, and the involuntary nature of its activation. Even with a small window, it would still be easy to time Kled's dismount intentionally to dodge turret shots, slow moving abilities, and the like. However, since Kled has no direct control of this, it essentially amount to a nullification of potential skill expression, and an extreme amount of frustrating moments of getting killed by abilities that should've been disjointed, especially since his passive is marketed as such a good tower diving tool. \n\nA few more notes, I'm not saying the Untargetability on Kled's passive isn't still good, just that it doesn't work as advertised and is entirely inconsistent with the mechanic as a whole and therefore frustrating. Furthermore, I'm not saying for Kled's sake it SHOULD work like other Untargetability, he doesn't necessarily need buffs, nor would that necessarily be the right way to buff him if he did. And its also still decent for diving, it allows him to drop agro even if he still gets hit by the tower shot in transit. What I AM saying, is that of the sake of the INTEGRITY OF THE GAME, either the mechanic should work the same in all instances, or INTENDED DIFFERENCES SHOULD BE NOTED. This also applies to the original topic of conditional mobility and Roots/Grounded effects. They should either be consistent, or inconsistencies should be intentional and communicated. \n\nAnother problem with Untargetability is the really odd interactions it has with some abilities that seem like they should be targeted. I'm pretty sure at this point everyone knows that Untargetability doesn't break tethers, and in my opinion that's a good thing. But does anyone have a reasonable explanation for why {{champion:64}} 's Q2, Resonating Strike, can damage champions WHILE they are Untargetable? There are other odd interactions as well, champion auto attacks that specifically CAN NOT be cancelled voluntarily, like {{champion:53}} 's E, will still hit Untargetable champions if the auto started while the were targetable, which just for clarification is not how autos, even empowered autos, are intended to interact with Untargetability. There's also been a long recurring bug (sorry) with {{champion:60}}  Rappel where she just kind of gets hit by tower shots and general damage anyway, during her Untargetability, just straight breaking the ability.  \n\nI've also noticed a lot of weird interactions with champion dashes with CC attached to them hitting each other. Most of my experience with this is while playing {{champion:6}} . One example, I could be wrong, is that {{champion:164}}  E ALWAYS cleanly beats Urgot's E, except in the case where Camille hits Urgot during the initial channel of his dash, which IS CONSISTENT with how abilities with channels work, think {{champion:18}}  W. The problem comes up when the dashes hit each other while both are active, one is a skillshot dash with a stun attached (Camille E), the other is a functionally equivalent skillshot dash with instead a flip followed by a stun attached (Urgot E). So why does Camille's E deal damage and stun Urgot, while his dash his literally no affect at all? And is there any method to this, like how would I know that that is how the interaction would work, without actually testing it? That's the kind of interaction I would expect to have some sort of rules for, and its just absurd that there aren't. I'm not just complaining about my champ either, I'm pretty sure the same thing happens between Galio and Urgot, but this time Urgot E completely overrides Justice Punch, and that's dumb too. \n\nI sincerely thank and congratulate you if you made it this far. I appreciate it. \n\nYour's Truly, a guy with too much time on his hands who is supposed to be writing a 7 page paper due tomorrow.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2018-04-16T00:40:01.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is this downvoted, it's factually correct lmao.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2018-04-15T21:30:28.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These should be called \"PULLS\" for clarification.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"greekvandaL","date":"2018-04-15T15:37:49.333+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":"Zoe Q could also ignore Silences so yeh.

She lost all of this CC for good reason. \n\nHer level of CC on release was an abomination for everything else that she brings. Her ult was nerfed because forcing your laner to stick around for 4 seconds whilst your jungler casually walks into lane with a targetted ability wasn't exactly interactive. She didn't need to land her E - just get kinda close with it. \n\nHer shield got a reduced CD in exchange for its lessened duration (originally 2.5s, now 2s duration and 16/13/10 CD vs. 20/15/10 CD). The new CD lines up with her E CD (also 16 seconds at rank 1), which is actually really significant for lanes where you need your E to force trades. \n\nThe true damage on her Q is the only thing that allows her to outscale tanks in the 1v1 (relevant because Camille is a splitpusher) and nerfing it gives her more bad match-ups (most tanks already beat her in lane due to her fairly weak early game and their ability to remove her safety by interrupting her E) without really doing anything to improve life for her or her opponent. She does enough damage to squishies. She still loses to all the same things assassins lose to (Zhonya, GA, Lulu). \n\nCamille got nerfed on release because she deserved to be nerfed on release.
