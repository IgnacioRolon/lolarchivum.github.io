They upgrade PBE so it's technically just a good as live. They also open PBE acess to everyone. It just so happens that because people like content, more and more people start playing on the PBE instead of live, to the point where there are more people on PBE than live.\n\nAt this point, what's the point of even having PBE and live seperate anymore? The majority of the community is going to have to experience the bad balance, bugs, etc on the PBE anyway. It'd be like if all the sudden Riot decided to make current PBE one patch behind live. That would be ridiculous, because the point of the PBE is to shield the majority of the playerbase from bugs and other bad/unfinished experiences.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2015-11-14T04:07:42.497+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=OldDirtay,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XWEqOAuo,comment-id=0002000100000000,timestamp=2015-11-14T02:37:49.315+0000)\n>\n> or heres a thought, make pbe indistinuishable from live\n\nftfy","replies":[{"poster":"OldDirtay","date":"2015-11-14T11:50:56.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hyrum Graff,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XWEqOAuo,comment-id=00020001000000000000,timestamp=2015-11-14T04:07:42.497+0000)\n>\n> ftfy\n\nfirst that would be indistinguishable\n\nsecond it would be, because it would have the next update on it to test bugs/balance etc\n\nare you retarded? or just a wise(not in this case)ass?","replies":[{"poster":"Battlecast Sona","date":"2015-11-14T22:11:40.153+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"...I think the point he's making is that if you have two servers, both of which have comparable situations (ping/connection/capacity/ease of use) but one has new champions on it and the other doesn't, which one is the community playing on?","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2015-11-15T02:30:18.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=A Vitriolic Cat,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XWEqOAuo,comment-id=0002000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-11-14T22:11:40.153+0000)\n>\n> ...I think the point he's making is that if you have two servers, both of which have comparable situations (ping/connection/capacity/ease of use) but one has new champions on it and the other doesn't, which one is the community playing on?\n\nIndeed, though I was perhaps a little too tounge-in-cheek and it made my point unclear.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-11-14T11:28:48.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They did that once and the saying 'It's only PBE, who cares' was said more times than 'GG EZ' is said on live.
