I am not a pro player so i make mistakes but in general if i die more than 2-3 times during laning i am having a really bad game\r\n\r\nthings i struggle with are\r\n\r\n* My early game mana is awful, until i get my 1st item i am a non entity\r\n*  I don&#039;t think i am agressive enough early, i prefer to play safe, hit 200 farm and then start some serious harass.\r\n* My roaming could take some work. i struggle with this as most of the time recently my bot and top lanes have pushed right out and theres no point roaming\r\n* Feeders. once the team feeds, and this has happened a lot i tend to get obliterated by the fed champ as i cant kite or escape well enough\r\n* Frustration, i have dropped from s3 to S5 with a constant stream of losses usually when 1-2 players just all out feed. i know it&#039;s supposed to be random but i guess i am tilted enough to come and write this\r\n*  Juggernauts mundo, nasus, darius etc just ignore my entire rotation walk through it, catch me and then kill me. any specific pointers on those would be really appreciated \r\n\r\nAre there any malza mains or higher elo players that can look at my build, CS etc and give me pointers to wipe the salt away with?","replies":[{"poster":"stabbycrabs","date":"2018-10-16T18:32:30.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"to be fair in general i dont have an issue with assasins, if i get a yi/khazix etc jungle i can usually lock them down. if my ult is on cooldown i am pretty cautious about not overextending. if they build QSS i build zhonya's and give them aids and crabs and proc my invunerability till they die\n\nIf i get an irelia/garen/mundo i a in trouble as they will just ignore the tower and come and get me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wublerdude","date":"2018-10-15T17:07:09.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Build against the enemy team, see which person(s) are fed and try to build against that is my best advice to give you.\nAs a jungler I don't play mid, but I do know that building right helps a lot.\nIf you're building the same items every game (even if out of order) it can cost you.\nTry to roam at level 6 with malz and get bot/dragon, that will help your team stay slightly more ahead,\nAs Mountain drake can help your team secure rift, Baron, and more dragons, Infernal will help your team win trades, Ocean will help your team play safer, and wind drake will allow them to escape ganks a little easier.\nBe nice to anyone that dies, even if they are mean, being nice can have an untilting effect on people which will help them relax, play safer, and not ragequit.\nsay WP! if you die or your team gets a kill, its little things like that, that can have a good impact on your team, \nDont trust your team to listen to pings,(If they do thats good tho) talk in chat about where the jungler was seen, if your laner is missing, or if dragon is free because of jungler top and yours is bot.\n\nThis is all I can offer you, hope this helps at least a little :D","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-10-15T20:29:35.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wublerdude,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=j4ZmAveb,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-10-15T17:07:09.341+0000)\n>\n>\n> If you&#x27;re building the same items every game (even if out of order) it can cost you.\n> \n\nThis is not necessarily true for mid lane (unless you are up against an opressive laner AKA Leblanc I would not recommend building against your laner).

If you really want a bigger effect on the game pick a more mobile champion. one of the things I love to do in low ELO games in ward enemy junglers red or blue camp (which ever is the one they did not start)after i push the first minion wave. then once you see them going for their buff and weak kill them and you get a double buff to beat your laner like a small child and really get ahead. usually low elo doesnt react to this quickly enough and you get a free kill. For advanced stuff I would have to see your gameplay, but malzahar is very one directional and predictable thus they enemy knows exactly what you will try to do or will do in team fights.","replies":[]}]}
