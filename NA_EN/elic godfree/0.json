Over the past months I lost well over 100 lp to client failures. Constant black screens. Freezes and connection failures. I don't mind losing 3 lp. But losing 20 plus to something that is beyond my control is just awful. I know for a fact it is not my internet. Because I got another 12 tabs running on things that are much more harder on my computer than what League does to it. However ever time it blacks out, it totally shuts down my computer. This is a pain in the ass to say the least, because then I have to shut the entire thing down. Which is awful to begin with. Then restart and hope I can connect in time before losing LP. If I do, awesome. But by the time the loading is done and so forth I'm already 3-4 levels down. Good luck with performing alright then. Ever since the retirement of Alpha client it just went way downhill. I had nothing, but bugs. Went through every single debugging process on that page multiple times. I reinstalled. Modified lines as Riot employees told me to do. I set the port numbers to the matching sequences. I done everything on my part. I just wish for once you'd focus on the client. We do not need no percentage max health true damage tank champion. Some dude that does invulnerable while scaling off max health gaining 100% lifesteal including gaining health walking though walls with his basic ability. That just.. why? Not to mention now a guy that can apparently forge weapons for you? We also have the ardent censer... and redemption. Completely game breaking. If you get that in the game, you're nearly 100% of the time going to win that. You just can't counter something like that honest. Now with the shield buffs it's even more of problem. There's a reason it's called ardent cancer. All I ask, is just to do something about the client. EU clients alone waited 5 years for changes. It's been posted many many times. NA is really not much better sadly. I feel the game is completely going in the wrong direction. Quality of life just isn't a thing I see with Riot focus anymore these days.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2017-08-25T00:17:32.590+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn, sounds like you've had to deal with some real shit with the client recently.  From reading your descriptions, it sounds like the root cause seems to be some sort of hardware issue or some sort of connection issue.  Keep in mind that your connection to our Client Servers is completely different to that of different internet tabs.  That is why you can have problems with the client, but use Youtube and other sites perfectly fine.\n\nIt seems like you have talked to us about this before, but I see you haven't submitted a ticket to us yet.  I think given that these issues are still going on, its your best bet to find the root cause and resolve it for good.
