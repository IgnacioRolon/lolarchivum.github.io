I am a former Marine and now I've decided to try my hand at streaming. I'd love if you'd stop by for a while and watch / give me some tips and tricks. Currently I'm at silver 1 just did my placements but I'll be doing a bunch of ranked to try to improve my game play. I play ADC mostly twitch, I'm a friendly fun young gun and I'd love to meet some new people while getting better at league! Come stop by I might have some RP cards up for raffle! Thank you for your time and help! I love interacting with new people so feel free to pop in and say hi!\n\ntwitch.tv/conspiracygg\n\nMy streaming times are 12-6pm EST. during the week!","replies":[]}
