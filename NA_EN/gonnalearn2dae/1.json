However, during the installation process, it mentions that there's a Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable (x64) problem. I'm not exactly a computer genius and don't know what that means exactly, however I'm smart enough to atleast work my way around the basic details? I've tried searching so many websites for answers and watched so many different kinds of youtube videos on how to fix the problem, but no matter what I try, it only mentions the Visual C++ problem... and I tried to download the Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable (x64) on the windows but for some reason it wont let me?? I figured that would've solved my problem but now I'm still stuck?! I just want to play League asap!! SOMEONE PLEASE HELP!!!","replies":[{"poster":"llNumbersll","date":"2016-10-03T22:39:34.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there can actually be a lot of problems with window 10 and LoL mine just happened to be that my firewall was blocking it once i turned it off it downloaded and played fine, have you tried switching your settings to run as windows 7 before downloading? i heard that helps, let me know if i can be of help, ill do my best!","replies":[{"poster":"GonnaLearn2Dae","date":"2016-10-04T17:24:30.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your support!
