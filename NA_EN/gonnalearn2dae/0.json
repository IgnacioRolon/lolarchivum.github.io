How can i speed up??","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SO pretty much, just wanting to download league and play it again on my laptop, had some connections problem before to where I got DC'd and had very bad lag spikes so I tried to look to the internet once again for help, did whatever I could to try and fix the problem from whatever advice I could find, and ultimately ended up losing my wifi connection to my laptop completely. I had to factory reset my laptop and now trying to download it again, which was successful, however the UPDATE speed is not getting any faster than 25 kbps?? and no matter what I try to do to fix that now, nothing is helping speed up the process... any help?! I just want it to hurry up so I  can play league already! And also if anyone could give any kind of explanation on why my connection would be so bad as to get me DC'd from game or even very bad lag spikes in game?? Only thing I could think of is if maybe I just have a bad or slow router, but what other explanation?!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-12T02:31:19.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anything prior to 33% during patching is highly influenced by your disk speed and administrative rights for League. I recommend working through our [permissions guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) to ensure League is configured correctly and can access all of the files and directories it needs to in order to run. \n\nLet me know if that resolved your issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GonnaLearn2Dae","date":"2016-10-11T23:46:20.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am literally not getting anywhere at all!!
