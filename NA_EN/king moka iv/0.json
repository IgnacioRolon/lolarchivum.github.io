I have some friends that will occasionally get fed up with players who are feeding and trash talk them. They have been playing League of Legends for 5 years and they get permabanned. League of Legends is banning valuable players who have invested tons of money and hours of their lives into their game, just because they talk shit in a video game. Like Dunkey said, &quot;what&#039;s the fun in the video game if I can&#039;t talk shit&quot;. \n\nOn the other hand, intentional feeders who stay quiet in the chat are getting off scott-free and continue to ruin games for others. You can always mute a toxic player, but you more often than not, you cannot stop a troll from feeding if he&#039;s set on it.\n\nI myself, got permabanned last night. I&#039;ll admit it, I get heated when I have incompetent players on my team, and I&#039;m sure everyone does. It&#039;s just that some people decide to speak up and some people decide to stay quiet. But this isn&#039;t the first time I&#039;ve been permabanned. I was permabanned 4 years ago, and I find it astonishing that the ban is for my entire life instead of extending it for a year or two years. Don&#039;t you think most people&#039;s behaviour would be changed by that (let alone all those people who will set the game aside after a year of inactivity). Unfortunately for me, I came back to realize that this was the exact same game I loved and hated so deeply. The gameplay and creativity gone into the game are incredible - really has potential to ruin someones life because of how fun it is. On the other hand, the riot games community has done so little for the actual players, and instead try to reward and benefit only competitive players. This needs to change. I spent over a thousand dollars on my account that was banned four years ago. I thought about all the time and money I&#039;d wasted on League of Legends just to lose all of it because a singed on my team decided to intentionally feed for 20 minutes. \n\nJust my two cents.\n\nTL;DR: Riot should encourage the use of the mute button and stop permabanning valued players who have invested time and money into the game - instead, focus on dealing with trolls and feeders.\n\nEdit: Yeah I know, controversial. Understand that flamers who say things like: \"I hope you die of cancer\" and constantly flame are not people I'm talking about. I'm speaking on behalf of the players who are frusterated in some of their games in which they have a troll or a player sabotaging the team.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2016-11-01T20:34:07.367+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"oh .. so spending money allows you to be toxic to the non-toxics who've also spent money?\n\nI think it's wise for them to protect the one that are paying AND not causing trouble instead of the small population that may pay money and are toxic.","replies":[{"poster":"King Moka IV","date":"2016-11-01T22:28:30.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I never said it was ONLY the people that were paying for the game.

There is someone saying\" No you are wrong im a perfect person and i dont like harsh words\" \"stop flaming and ruining my game\" ... typical riot brainwashing if you ask me. Dont want flame? Mute the person.. Or maybe think about why you are being flamed. Are you playing a champion for the first time in ranked? Are you playing something way off meta and refusing to coordinate with your team? Or maybe you are just having a bad game? sure everyone has a bad game.. someone flames? MUTE them... the tribunal is a joke honestly. it should be there for INT feeders and cheaters, NOT someone flaming in chat. If you want the tribunal for chat punishments and permabans for chat use.. then you need to remove the MUTE button as it is useless.. all it does is shield a player until the game is over.. Riot acts like they are going to lose a massive player base because of toxicity .. they are wrong.. they lose players due to perm bans from chat use. Knock it off direct your time spent to the INT feeders and people that are actualy ruining the game.. not someone that has tried to communicate what is wrong in the current game to the player doing poorly and getting no response or \" dont tell me how to play\" and then an arguement starts. there are players out there that will agg a person on just to get that juicy report after the game.

It takes a *lot* to actually ever get punished. You must be consistently toxic to ever get punished just once for minor offenses, and you have to work through multiple tiers of punishment to even get banned for it.
