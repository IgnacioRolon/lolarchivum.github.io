He was born into deep poverty among many others in Noxus.  He had no political views, he has lived all 19 years of his life struggling to eat, make wages, or even find shelter, so to him Noxus, Demacia, Ionia, all the same struggle in his eyes.  He picked up the art of theft at a young age, able to sneak through \" Unbreakable Noxian Fortresses \" and fill his pockets with gold, all with ease.  He was never greedy with his gold and always shared with those in need, but preferred to be isolated from others.   On (  name  )'s  16th birthday he snuck out of Noxus and into Demacia.  This, is when everything took a turn. \r\n    (   name   )  was out on the Demacian streets pick pocketing small amounts of gold from those who seemed wealthy.  This is when he met the Demacian Scout, Quinn.  (  name  ) wasn't concerned for gold, he was interested in Valor.  He had never seen such a tamed beast,  Quinn and Valor spoke to each other seamlessly, like there was no language barrier.  He instantly jumped to her side and began to ask questions.  Little did he know, Quinn would soon take him under her wing.  Quinn did not approve of his thievery but would turn a shoulder to it if she saw.  She wouldn't teach him hwo to sneak or steal, but she would teach him how to run, scout, and fight.\r\n   (  name  )  was 17 when he first applied for the League.  He failed, and the judges weren't easy on him.  He went into a state of depression for nearly 3 months before quinn and valor could get him back.  But after, he was stronger than ever.  (  name  ) was determined to improve his life every single day,  all he wanted to was join the League, where he could put his skills as a thieve to use without being persecuted. \r\n   On his 19th birthday he applied for the League again.  The Judges laughed in his face when they saw who walked through the doors.  It didn't bother him. He wanted to prove them wrong more than ever.  He started off with showing off his skills in speed by snatching every coin purse of the judge.  Showed them, than returned before they could speak.  Next he fought with Quinn.  It wasn't an easy task, Quinn used real bolts.  They had never done this before.  They fought for three long hours before the judges called the fight off./\r\n  Their first words were not pleasing.  They weren't happy with the heist of their coin purse, and wasn't impressed by the injuries he suffered in the fight, or the blood that stained their halls.  What they were satisfied with, was his dedication.  Not many people are rejected and return to have themselves beaten restless and still continue to fight.

I dare say that this champion would be entirely more game breaking than anything Riot has ever released.\n\nStealing money is more of an issue when it's stealing too much money from too great of a distance away. If he practically has to be right on top of the champion he's stealing from, it's not as bad because he's now risking his life for it, especially if it's only 1-2 extra gold per second, which would pretty much just mean that he is his own little gold item. The same goes for handing over some extra gold to an ally: if it's not too much gold at a time, it's basically like they got another kill on a decent-sized monster. I do agree that the numbers he gave are a bit much, but with a little tweaking it could work out.\nForcing (name) to get within melee range of a champ to steal just a little bit of gold from it will also force the adc to pull his own weight. He can't sit back and let (name) get all the gold for him because (name) will be getting his ass kicked (after we take care of the tanky-ness issue) and never get the chance to do anything for him. Decreasing the amount of gold that (name) can give at a time will also make it take much longer for the adc to build gold if he just waits for it than it would take if he goes out and last hits some things, especially since, again, (name) will be getting his ass handed to him and not typically have enough gold for anything.","replies":[{"poster":"ModelT","date":"2015-03-23T21:04:57.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think you understand exactly the negative effect of gold theft.

This is unprecedented in LoL, and not because Riot is unimaginative, but because it's incredibly unbalanced because it undermines the entirety of the item system.  Honestly this concept seems so bad that I almost think you're trolling.\n\nRead the changes I suggested for these abilities. Now let's think for a moment. \n\nYou said that he's working with the adc. Ok, that means he most likely went bot lane because the typical set-up is 1 top 1 mid 1 jung 2 bot (1 adc, 1 supp). Let's go with that for now, we'll look at other possible positions later. \nNow let's look at typical bot-lane play. What champions do you usually see in bot lane? Typically ranged champions. Almost no one goes bot with a melee champ because against good ranged opponents they would never get close enough to do anything. Those that do go bot lane as melee champions are typically either idiots or are good at getting/forcing enemies into melee range. \nNow let's see what happens when we have (name) go bot lane. \nFirst, let's see what his basic attack range is. As a thief (as opposed to a murderer who could shoot someone and would look in the wallet after he killed the target) who is most-likely used to snatch-and-run robberies, it can be implied that he has to be pretty close to an opponent to steal money, which means he has to have learned close-range combat rather than ranged fighting. Therefore, we can assume that he's a melee fighter, and this is supported by the fact that he fought with Quinn, and while it isn't mentioned what weapon he used, he got his ass handed to him during a fight with a fairly ranged champion, implying that ranged combat isn't his area of expertise. So, we have a melee fighter in bot lane against presumably long-range. \nOkay, is he any good at getting enemies close to him? Well, he has that stealth from Q (which I already said needs to be decreased to a couple seconds at a time), that might get enemies closer to him simply because they can't see him... except I already said that when moving his outline should still be visible and he should still be targetable, so as long as his (presumably ranged) enemy is paying attention, he's not getting anywhere near them. What about W? No, that only helps allies, and the passive only affects monsters and minions. E, maybe? Well, with my suggested changes making it a smokescreen that could make it easier to get close... except that it should wear off after a little while, after which he would need some kind of defense or way to deal massive damage. The increased movement speed from his passive, perhaps? Max enhancement of 10% increased movement speed if he's near 5 enemy champions, at which point he's probably busy running away whilst sh*tting himself. Max enhancement when only up against the 2 he should be dealing with at the beginning of the game: 4% increased movement speed when he gets close... yeah, that's not happening, especially with even slightly decreased armor. So, early game he's practically useless in bot lane unless he's with a champ that can drag an opponent to him like Blitzcrank or Thresh, in which case he can be close to the target for a while as the enemy tries to fight (name) and (dragging champion) off, and even then, (name) has decreased armor against what might be a fairly powerful champion, making running away seem like the more valid option if he had to choose between that and staying to get money. As for later in the game when he has R? With my changes he would only get increased movement speed when he's getting REALLY low on health, which again makes running away seem like a more valid option, and the active effect still has him getting his ass kicked 75% of the time (dodging every 4th ass kicking) and dealing critical hits with his basic attacks which, again, he has to get close for. So overall, he's not a good \"get ranged champions close to me\" melee champion.\nNow let's look at W, his money giving ability, the thing that gives you the most problems with this champion. With my suggestion, he's giving 25-29 gold per activation, to his adc according to your logic and the fact that he's going bot anyways. He also has it on a VERY long cooldown, so his adc isn't getting THAT much each time. In addition, he needs to have lots of mana to use the ability as I suggested at the top of the post. In addition to this, something that I didn't mention would be that he should have extremely LOW mana and mana regen, making it harder to cast his spells at all. Couple this with his ass getting kicked all the time if he tries to get anywhere near the enemy, and what you've got isn't a fighter, it's a feeder. Sure, he's handing his own team money, but every time he gets caught off guard, he's getting his ass handed to him by an enemy and giving them free kills, letting them level up faster. The ADC is meanwhile fighting practically without a teammate, so it's actually kind of nice to have extra money to spend since he is pretty much just going solo while earning half the experience he should be because he has to share it with a (name) who can't fight/help the fight, except for with his E which will also cost a lot of mana and be on a fairly long cooldown. So, overall, (name)'s overall patheticness kind of balances out the fact that he's handing his adc money. The exact amount that he should give is still up for debate to determine the right balance so the game stays fair, but in the end it's playing 4.5 v 5 in exchange for a little extra money for one player.\nSo, from this we've determined that (name) is a melee champion who's terrible at getting enemies close to himself and is overall a pretty terrible fighter in bot lane. As a result, the best course of action to make the passive money stealing fair would be to make the money stealing effect only activate when he's within 125 units (melee distance) of the target being stolen from. Now it's playing 4.5 v 5 in exchange for 1 player getting a little more money and a little less money for any ranged champions dumb enough to let (name) anywhere near them.\n\nNow let's look at other lanes. Could (name) be a top-laner? Top lane enemies are typically close/mid-range fighters, so it's easier to get close to them, but they're also a LOT tougher, making it hard for (name) to damage whoever he's laning against while (name) is fairly squishy (given the changes I suggested). His E and R give him a little edge, but (name) would have to farm quite a bit from his turret to get to a decent level. As for his W, he is most likely laning on his own so he'd only be giving money to the jungler whenever he comes up.\nCould (name) be a mid-laner? Mid-lane enemies typically have ranged attacks, powerful attacks, a good amount of cc, and/or good escape strategies. While (name) does have his smokescreen as both a ranged attack and a getaway, he again has no one other than the jungler to give money to and a difficult time getting close to the ranged or fast enemy mid-laner.\nCould (name) be a jungler? His W's passive makes this a bit more likely than those last two, allowing him to deal more damage to monsters. His q would be useless, however, as he is still targetable and presumably still attackable. His E and R would be more useful as well, so really he is more likely to be a jungler than a bot laner. However, I would like to point out that now he is fighting the enemy jungler as well as every other enemy that he happens to run across because if he's a good jungler he'll be going across the map. He will be able to give money to more allies, but he's very bad at fighting most enemies, and even with the element of surprise from ganking, he'd still have trouble doing much of anything before getting his ass handed to him.\n\nOverall, with the changes I suggested, A.) he'd be a better jungler than the bot laner you implied, and B.) he's terrible against most champion types, making any game with him a 4.5 v 5, so a little additional money to his team and a little less money to the enemy would actually kind of balance things out once the right numbers were figured out, especially if he has to get REALLY close to opponents in order to steal their money in the first place.\n","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"bad arcade kitty","date":"2015-03-24T05:42:41.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pretty thief :3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Psychoaryama","date":"2015-03-23T23:33:35.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One last thing: since you seem to dislike money champions, here's a headache for you: [Forsenthio, the Mad Multi-Millionaire](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/LeHQKHcJ-forsenthio-the-mad-multi-millionaire)\n(No, I didn't make this one just to anger you, although it's working out that way; you'll see that it was created weeks ago, long before this (name) the Petty Theft thread was made.)","replies":[{"poster":"ForPortal","date":"2015-03-24T05:39:18.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Forsenthio might be redeemable because the terrible gold steal mechanic is not the core focus of his kit.

Without a mana cost, these abilities are just too easy to cast. If all of his abilities had a fairly high mana cost, it would be a bit fairer because he can't cast as many of these spells in a row because he would need to build his mana up to use them again.\n\n**Passive**: I'd suggest only 5 **gold per second stolen** as a max, and probably **just 1-2** would be better given how slowly gold is typically earned if you don't consider gold from kills. Just 1-2 gold stolen would most likely take away (most of) their base gold earning per second. Also, I'd specify that he has to be **within 125 units (melee)** of the target to steal from them. Just stealing from \"nearby\" targets could be anything from 100 units away to 300 units away depending on your definition of \"close\".\n\n**Q:** **30-60-90 seconds** of stealth is probably one of the **longest stealths the game has** aside from sitting in a bush all game. I'd suggest **only stealthing for 3-3.5-4-4.5-5 seconds**, at most, and perhaps while moving his **outline is still visible** and he can be targeted.\n\n**W:** **100 gold** doesn't seem like much late-game, especially with that cooldown and even if we assume he loses 100 gold to use this, but **it can still add up**. At most I'd suggest **25/26/27/28/29 gold** (levelling with skill). The reason I pick such a \"low\" number is that even just that much gold takes forever to build up if you're just sitting trying to passively earn gold for something, so it really is quite a bit to get just all at once.\nI'd also suggest that for the passive it should say \"deals a **small amount of extra damage (based on skill's level)** against monsters, epic monsters, and minions\". The reason for this is that dealing extra damage against monsters based on your level, in addition to the scaling damage that you get just for levelling up normally, plus any other AD items, could make his attack damage OP for a stealth fighter that's meant to stay out of a fight if possible, and even if this only works on minions and monsters, that would work out to be some very OP laning and some very quick fights with Brambleback and Blue Sentinel. Levelling up with the skill and only giving a small increase to your power will keep you as a supporter that makes laning just a bit quicker and can help out just a bit with junglers but not be too powerful.\nI'd also **extend the cooldown** so he can't just sit for 25 seconds, gain 25 gold, and hand it over. Overall, **this champ's abilities need relatively long cooldowns** just to be fair.\n\n**E:** I'd suggest that instead of a stun screen it should just be an **AoE smokescreen** that lasts for a short time, **maybe with a 5-9% slow** due to the coughing that would result from a real-life smokescreen. The smokescreen can **decrease enemies' vision** while within the area and maybe blind them so they can't see anything on their map while in the area. This would make it a more defensive ability and allow for both getaways and damage if the \"If cast while stealthed can cast again to ignite screen and lasting damage\" part is kept. I'd also suggest that it **not be lasting damage**, but just magic damage upon ignition. The last thing this game needs is more Ignites.\n\n**R:**\n**Passive:** these **numbers seem a bit much**, and makes him seem like a **super-fast tank** when he's weak. **Reduced damage doesn't make much sense with a stealth fighter** which is supposed to be less tanky and more just fast/sneaky, so probably **remove that part entirely**, and maybe just give him **15/20/25% increased movement speed** (max, maybe 10/15/20% or 10/13/16% would be better) when his health is reduced to **30% or below**.\n**Active:** Again, those **numbers seem a bit much**. When this spell reaches lv. 3 he **dodges over half of the basic attacks** aimed at him. Dodging makes more sense than blocking, so **don't swap it with blocking**, because, again, a tanky stealth fighter doesn't work too well so he shouldn't be able to \"block\" anything, but perhaps he should **only gain 15/20/25% dodge** (at most, that would still mean dodging every 4th basic attack, but this *is* an ult after all...) and maybe just **leave it at increased chance of critically hitting**, leaving out the part about critical hits being 300% damage, because that still seems a bit OP, especially when at lv. 3 this skill makes 7 out of 10 of your attacks critical hit.\nThe **Cooldown** should probably also just decrease by 10 seconds per level, so it's **120/110/100 seconds**.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ForPortal","date":"2015-03-22T08:01:01.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Everything about this is terrible.\n\nGold theft is terrible.\nDodge chance is terrible.\nHis overloaded kit is terrible.\nDoing all of this while invisible is terrible.\n\nJust look at his passive and his Q.
