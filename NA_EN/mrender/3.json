Then one day I signed on to find a letter and I had been awarded a free random skin it was a heimer skin and I was given a badge on the forums to show I was a \"helpful\" person\n\nI did actually notice this a while ago but I just kinda procrastinated ever bringing it up XD I'm a terrible procrastinator XD\n\nAlso I noticed my other recruiter badge was still there recently so I wondered why it was there but not my other badge. Its not a big deal but I was just wondering about it was all...","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-31T20:29:48.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We did have an old wrenchmen program on NA that has since concluded.

Thank you for letting me know what happened as I was curious about it. Anyways I'll continue to keep posting bug reports and suggestions either way ^.^ however most \"help/support\" questions tend to be beyond me these days... it amazes me how much things have changed over just a few years lol.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ihatethisgame111","date":"2016-08-29T16:28:32.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Why'd you get a reward for that?

The current ranking system was a created in a very very very large post by me and put up as a forum discussion with many many points. I also helped A LOT of people with technical support stuff when the stuff was a lot easier to answer ^.^ and I've been active on the forums reporting bugs what not since season 1 =\\","replies":[]},{"poster":"Man In Sky","date":"2016-08-31T16:37:24.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ihatethisgame111,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=J9lhuBzO,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-08-29T16:28:32.760+0000)\n>\n> Why&#x27;d you get a reward for that?
