Thanks for the reply. So should I assume its some form of CSS or javascript glitch =\\ somewhere the code is calling for color: white and is calling for collor: yellowish*.

(PhP is server side so I can't see any PhP on my end) That might take a while XD I'm a bit rusty on my web design been 2-3 years XD so unless you have some advice 0.0 I have no idea how to even start such a post ^.^","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-02T20:25:09.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The change in that font color that you mention doesn't actually signify or reflect anything.
