Maybe this would be hard to do , but would be cool if you could push the ball just by walking next to it , and each champ would have ONE spell with like 10 s cd where they'd do a good strong kick on the ball a bit like lee sin's kick but they all would have that .","replies":[]},{"poster":"VelvetCrotch","date":"2017-10-30T23:08:41.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL lmfao :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lexually","date":"2017-10-30T19:06:27.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lmao.
