Those are things YOU can work towards every game that will provide a sense of accomplishment in a recognizable way. They are also things that NOBODY ELSE CAN TAKE AWAY FROM YOU(which is important to avoid getting angry at others). You can become better in any game - no matter the result, you can practice skills, learn new tactics, even something as simple as working on safe warding or farming. Winning should never be your goal(except during tournaments but that's a difference story) in any aspecto f your life. Your goal should always be to improve at whatever you do. As you become better, success and victory will come to you over time. But that's the result of having a good mindset and approachnig the game in the right way.\n\nAnd you improve more in games that you lose than in games you win. The harder the game was, the more there is to learn from it, the more you can improve, the better you can become, and thus the whole 'why must I have to bare it' thing never comes into play. Those games become opportunities to improve, not bitter defeats. It's all about your mindset. \n\nHere's something I posted a while ago... http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/tips-tricks/tg1cxnOB-advice-for-enjoying-and-succeeding-in-ranked-play\nIt's a set of rules I started following that helped *me* improve a lot. Maybe it can help you too.

The \"win\" crowd comes off as saying yes, it completely negates the fun.\n\nI wonder if it's also tied to your impression of how long the game is salvageable. Some people their ADC gives up first blood and it's \"gg /ff @20\". Others look at the game and say \"if I can stall this out, they'll lose momentum and we can make a comeback\". Even if they didn't manage to turn the game around, if they closed the gap it's a success to them and made the game more fun.\n\n----\nFun vs Win\nTime Wasted vs Time Used\nSurrender Frequently vs Never Surrender\n\nI suspect there's a strong correlation between these things in certain players.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TheXtractor","date":"2015-07-09T14:36:50.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im talking about if you are in champion select, and random person X is picking something weird, if you go into a game with a bad attitude like 'omg this dude picks XYZ bla bla' and every mistake he might make you complain about and such.
