For example, you might have a Reconnect button but it's not taking priority on your screen.  \n\nTrying to interact with the client with a popup failing totake priority can cause this crash or bugsplat. **Tapping the Enter key while loading at champ select should accept the pop up and allow you to connect to the game server.**\n\nIt's also important to make sure your OS is up to date as well.  Let me know if this helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GUtz yw","date":"2017-11-15T16:28:41.951+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"same here i’m a mba user.
