Because it does damage over time the damage it does is itself reduced after each instance of damage.\n\nIf we say it does damage 5 times over its duration to simplify, it used to deal 5% current health on every instance of damage. Meaning if a target has 1000 hp then it&#039;s going to deal 50 + 47.5 + 45.125 + 42.869 + 40.723 = 226.22 damage the equivalent of 22.6% max hp before resists. \n\nCompare that to the new max hp damage and you get 1000 \\* 4% \\* 5= 200, 20% max hp.\n\nSo there is still a small damage drop from full health, but once the target is below22.6% max hp this is just a massive buff as the current hp damage decreases massively but the total hp damage will not.\n\nThat small 2.6% damage nerf amounts to nothing after you realize how much more damage will be done afterwards.\n\nSo that&#039;s it. There&#039;s no real point to this post except spewin out a few numbers I thought would be interesting to calculate.","replies":[]}
