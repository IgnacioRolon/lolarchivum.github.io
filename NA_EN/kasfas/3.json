I also feel the main issue right now with Sunfire is with its passive, which doesn't convey its damage in the most interesting manner. Here's how I'd go about changing the item:\n---\n#Sunfire Cape\n* **Recipe:** Bami's Cinder + Jaurim's Fist + 800g (total cost: 2900g).\n* **Stats:** +500 health, +30 attack damage (+0 health and +15 attack damage from its components).\n* **Unique Passive - Immolate:** Moving and attacking makes the next basic attack _Energized_. Energized attacks grant the wielder 15 - 100 armor for 4 seconds, and at the end of the duration the wielder deals 45 - 300 magic damage to all nearby enemies.\n\nThe numbers and specifics are obviously placeholder, but the idea is that instead of simply dealing small amounts of PBAoE damage per tick, the wielder would build up to a powerful burst of damage over time. Because this would require the wielder to stick to the target for an extended duration as well, it would also encourage fighters to commit or initiate, rather than just inch out trade advantages in lane.

Use Fiora passive indicator to warn both players of where the flames are going to shoot next.   This way tank can clear waves by positioning themselves within the wave while giving the opponent a chance to dodge the flames as long as the AoE effect starts on the edge of the model.\n\nNow you can tune a) period b) range c) damage instead of just a) damage you can tune on the current version.","replies":[]},{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2017-10-03T06:49:03.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's the identity of the item?

This will def allow for better fine tuning of the cape's power level, and power spikes, but I feel that atm, league hast _too many_ active effect items as is.\n\nSo instead, how about something different? I noticed that ya'll were toying around with the concept to reactive effects with masteries/runes (i.e. after taking damage do 'x') so why not try that out?\n\nFor example, have Sunfire have a passive aura that pulses once ever 'x' seconds (let's say 3 for now) since the pulse is so long, you could even give a small vfx to indicate when the next pulse will be, that way the pulse can do modest damage. It will reduce it's effectiveness for wave clearing while not removing that feature entirely (cuz let's face it, that's one of the key benefits of sunfire)\n\nnow for the reactive effect: every time you receive damage from an enemy champion, the cape \"flares up\" and begins pulsing once every half second for 2 seconds, then over the next 3 seconds slows down to it's original rate. (you can fine tune these numbers as needed, and even throw in a lock out mechanic if necessary to prevent it from overly punishing opponents that try to all in) (also, you could throw in large jungle monsters also proc'ing this effect so that junglers won't feel bad about getting it)\n\nIMO this allows Sunfire to become a relevant item again, as atm, the aoe pulse just doesn't feel meaningful as an anti-engage tool, and the stats currently are kinda lack luster as well. With the retuned numbers, and cycles, it gives both a sense of utility if used on an aggressor, and a sense of counter-play for those playing against it, as they can choose to proc the effect and wait out it's power spike before engaging their opponent while it's on cd.\n\nThoughts?","replies":[]},{"poster":"SonicÐeHedgedawg","date":"2017-10-03T00:54:41.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like the problem is that it pulls double duty as a waveclearing split-Pusher item AND an ambient damage team fight item and when it's good at both it feels oppressive and when it's bad at one (or both) it feels too limited to buy\n\nMaybe if it did more damage, but it took a few seconds of exposure before doing damage there'd be more counterplay.\n\nLike, you get a visual indicator on yourself and your minions that they are “heating up” but it takes a couple of seconds before they heat up enough to “catch fire”. Once they do, they take considerably more damage than live, but that gives you a couple of seconds to escape or push your enemy off of the minion waves before his Sunfire does damage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Abibyama","date":"2017-10-02T14:27:57.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can't wait to see poppy and malph outdamaging ADC while taking no damage\n\nAlso Mundo is a Jugg not a tank","replies":[{"poster":"Infernape","date":"2017-10-02T14:30:19.006+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":">Also Mundo is a Jugg not a tank\n\nBut his entire kit revolves around him building tank items.
