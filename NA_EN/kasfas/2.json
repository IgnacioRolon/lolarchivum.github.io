No details to share yet (since we&#x27;re just starting work on it), but the plan is to at least investigate giving some love to underperforming tanks. Should know more some time next week most likely.\n\nI think what some people are focusing on is the confusion of when tanks are supposed to be good.  In early game they haven't become that tanky yet or have their items which help them do their job.  In mid game they get pushed out by Black Cleaver builders in both jungle and top and sometimes the ADC.  In late game all ADC's build some combination of Lord Dominiks or Mortal Reminder and you can add Blade of the Ruined King of that mix.\n\nThis is not including champions who come with true damage built in, particularly some of the popular ADC's such as Twitch, Varus, Kog'maw and Vayne.\n\nStacking HP was the one thing that allowed tanks to still tank, that's all been reduced and Sunfire/Cinder is worse.  So, it's left tanks in kind of a weird spot where they aren't supposed to do much damage, but can't tank properly anymore either.  We see this in reverse with bruisers who get to have the fun with all the tank items, but still get their damage as well, because they always benefit the most from new changes on either side of the spectrum.  I think most of us assumed HP was the tank stat, as crit is to ADC and lethality to assassins.\n\nIMO tanks as a whole actually are a strong class, but this newest shake up in combination with the meta is causing some problems with how they are supposed to function.  The balancing act of figuring out how to make tanks \"tankier\" without affecting who else can have it must be a very tricky road indeed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2017-05-10T14:36:36.867+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be prettymuch every tank exept for sejuani and maybe gragas+gallio....\nThe winrate of about everytank exept of seju dropped this patch, same for many of the juggenauts.\nThe top 8 of the 10 highest winrates toplane(https://euw.op.gg/champion/pantheon/statistics/top) use no tank items, one of the others only uses some if the hardly changed ones(deadmen's+SV) and the last one is Seju...\n\nThe issue is not a few champs underperforming.
