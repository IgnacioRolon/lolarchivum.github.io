Been back pass 3 - 4 weeks.  I got reported 3 times that i know of and no warnings no nothing just pop up a permanent ban on my screen. How come that i get banned just through my chat? \r\n\r\nIf you compare my chat with the person that was RAGING on those games, i actually told them to stop raging, and play the game. Then 2 of those game i had a guy intentionaly feeding.  So explain how come from those 2 games i get a permanent ban. \r\n\r\nWaiting for a reply, since support WONT LET ME MAKE A TICKET.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-17T02:45:47.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those games in the past gave this account a 2 week suspension, not a permanent ban.

Or when you can be on a team of people who are all 4 friends trying to level a new account and go 4/3/4 while their friend dies 15 times and they flame you all game and treat you like trash when they are inting but you get 4 reports with this system... it is a garbage lazy trash system, and they listen to no appeals of context or reasoning which are valid often... like if you do not curse at all just say please leave me alone and stop inting or something and they all curse you out how is that fair to be banned? they are the toxic ones but they are all friends so you are oddball out getting screwed... so to answer your question /mute all every game till at least plat where people have enough of a brain to not ruin the game at 1/10 and call you a \"rtard\" or \"fhead\".....\n\n\nso never try and take smite last second if you are top and your troll jg has heal cause you do not want to be sol a game and if you are trying to just even get to the level you can do ranked as a new player dodge every game where people are all club buddies cause they will int and blame you.... :D :D:D You guys at Riot are great... it is great to try and save the game with no jg and be told off or have a game where you are camped and do not even die and get flamed as your ally jg (friends with your team  in the same club) ints 1v2 and blames you and ruins the game...\n\n\nYou do not look individually at anything or you would do a much better job at thinking of the variables of context.","replies":[{"poster":"SadKill","date":"2017-10-17T15:04:25.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where are you getting this whole top taking smite thing, he said nothing about taking smite in the games. The system isn't perfect but it's a whole lot better than not having some sort of system in place and Riot has shown and many occasions (even this occasion) to try and resolve the issue personally if there is an issue.\nAs was said the ban was a 2 week suspension which escalated to a ban after that suspension was over and toxic behavior still happened.\nI can say that the system can ban people unjustly but it's rare.\n\nSo if you have some sort of personal vendetta, as it seems you do with you spouting out tons of stuff that's not even relevant to this situation, go make your own thread or something.","replies":[{"poster":"ˇaaˇaaˇaaˇ","date":"2017-10-17T22:42:39.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i guess you cannot read :D I was giving examples of things which happen which lead to reports which they dish out punishment for with no regard for context.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dogleaf","date":"2017-10-17T17:03:28.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=M19EZehI,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-10-17T02:45:47.011+0000)\n>\n> Those games in the past gave this account a 2 week suspension, not a permanent ban.
