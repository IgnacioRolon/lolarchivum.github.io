My problem isn't that big or even that important. I'm not even sure if I can call this a problem, more of a suggestion, but I don't know where else or how else to ask this.\r\n\r\nI like icons. I like the free icons I could get. I try to collect icons. There's one I missed, but I would say it's completely my fault (The black hole icon when Dark Star Thresh was released). I don't have an issue with that icon since I can buy it from the shop, eventually. No, I have a problem with the Piltover icon. There's a few issues about getting it that has really irked me, mostly because I missed it. The biggest one being knowing when it was available. \"Coming Soon\" is not specific enough. Please give me a date. I was checking that Piltover/Zaun featured page for like 2 weeks straight and never seen it change. It's vague and unhelpful. I don't use reddit or any other media for  League stuff so I wasn't lucky enough to see a post saying \"Oh hey, you can get the icon now\". It's also really cumbersome to dig through the pages to find that one single link to that page (seriously, why isn't it somewhere on the Universe main page?). I had more things to do than just check that page for weeks on end to see when I could claim the icon. Things like, I don't know...playing the game. Nevertheless, I missed getting the icon and I can't even buy it now.\r\n\r\nI feel like it wasn't my fault. There was no date saying when it would come up and end. There was no link to the page on the main site when it was released. No advertisements or announcements. Nothing. But I'm not asking to be gifted the icon. No. Instead, I want to offer a suggestion. When the Zaun icon is released, allow people like me who missed the first time to be able to claim the Piltover icon. I now have an idea when it could come out now (most likely when the Warwick rework is online) so if I miss it this time, it's completely my fault. I just feel it was unfair to almost hide getting the icon, with the whole \"coming soon\" and no easy way to get on that specific page. Please, just consider it. I know it probably won't happen but...I can't say I haven't tried. Thank you regardless.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-25T00:57:07.158+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know you enjoy collecting icons and how much it means to you to get that icon.  We did give players time to claim their icon and set a deadline to put in a ticket by the 10th if it was missed.  The icon is not currently  available, but I think you add a great suggestion and will be passing the feedback.   It could also make a return at some point in the future, but you'll have to bookmark our [News](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/) page if anything like that comes up.  \n\nI do feel your pain, and though we can't give the icon I will make sure your suggestion is passed on.  In the meantime, make sure to keep a close eye on the Zaun icon!","replies":[{"poster":"SkV ShadoAnnaru","date":"2017-01-26T22:35:38.816+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for reading. I understand completely and hope my suggestion at least makes everyone a bit more considerate when dealing with deadlines and the ease of finding details of said deadlines. I know I might sound a bit whiny or spoiled so I apologize for that. Something as small as this doesn't diminish the love for this game at all. I will always support this game and Riot. Even if the icon never comes back, just knowing a few employees have read my plea and understood how I feel...it's really humbling.\n\nKeep being awesome.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}
