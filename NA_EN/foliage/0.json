(Default Summoner Icon)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically, whenever I'm in a lobby (custom game, party lobby) all current members have their profiles set to the default summoner icon (which shouldn't be as their summoner icon is different.) It seems to be affecting only me as when I hover over my account, it says I have frequently played random (which I haven't) and everyone else's show's fine.\r\n\r\nCause of this, I'm unable to change my club tag even though I have one of my clubs as active but it doesn't change or activate in game which is strange.\r\n\r\nEverything else seems to work fine (No issues logging in, connecting to game, chatting with friends, accessing the store, my profile, etc.) It is however a minor annoyance seeing everyone with the  default icon and not being able to change my club tag.\r\n\r\nI have tried re-installing League and Disabling my firewall but the issues are still present so I believe it must be a riot bug or a network error? I'm not sure. (Restarting doesn't fix it either.)\r\n\r\nHere's an image of what I'm talking about: \r\n[Link](http://imgur.com/a/mGm6O)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-30T15:55:37.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The default summoner icons in lobby is a known issue that a lot of players are experiencing right now.  This should just be a visual display issue, and shouldn't have an effect on anything else.  Club tags can't be changed after it's been created on a club.  Hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Foliage","date":"2016-08-30T16:40:31.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah thanks that defiantly clears some things up. It just happened recently so I thought something was wrong with something on my end. Thanks for the response!","replies":[]}]}]}
