It's quite easy to miss them otherwise and the latest tab on the site doesn't inform you about biography updates, only completely new stuff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2019-02-06T12:27:58.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that having a separate \"patch notes\" section is really good.\n\nThe only addition I'd imagine is to have also a client news pop-up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"C me","date":"2019-02-06T12:25:49.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe add a note on why a specific bit was changed/updated. \n\nDon't get me wrong, any new lore is great to have, but the yi and annie stories seemed kind of random compared to what we usually get when new stories are to do with a region update/new champion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2019-02-06T12:26:36.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Indeed, a really welcome addition and I hope it's going to stay for any Lore update we'll get.","replies":[]}]}
