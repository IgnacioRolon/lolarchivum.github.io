People disagreeing about something doesn't prove that a thing isn't, merely that people disagree.  Frankly, that shouldn't come as much of a surprise.  People disagree about nearly everything.\n\nWe know people disagree about what is and isn't good (or evil).  There are several possible ways to explain this.\n\n1)  Good and evil don't exist.  Straight up.  End of discussion.  At most you can talk about virtues and taboos, which are purely cultural.\n\n2)  Good and evil exist, but they're unknowable.  There's an absolute standard for rightness and wrongness, but we have no way of knowing with any certainty what it is.  The old elephant proverb fits this scenario well.\n\n3) Good and evil exist, they're knowable, and mortal depravity rebels against it.  There's an absolute standard for rightness and wrongness and people have some degree of natural understanding what it is.  However the conscience is a precision instrument and constant abuse can damage it.\n\n4) Only a select few things are good or evil, but people like rules.  There are some things that are absolutely good and absolutely evil, but humans often like life to be structured rigorously.  Lots of other rules get created that aren't good or evil, but are merely cultural.  Disagreements arise when moors are confused for ethical imperatives (and visa versa).\n\nOr some combination thereof.\n\nEvil and good are both absolute terms.  If you're throwing around the word evil, you're appealing to an objective standard.  You might be mistaken about that standard, or maybe the other guy is, or maybe you BOTH are, but it's still an objective standard that's being invoked.","replies":[{"poster":"Metallikaiser","date":"2019-02-21T14:42:48.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, I would say the objectivity of Good and Evil is rooted in Christian morality.

But something tells me that not all are inclined to agree with that, and that not all would appreciate a fictional world written from a Christian perspective on it either.\n\nGiven that there's a pretty large range of not-Christian ideologies that believe in objective standards for good and evil I don't know if pinning this on the Christians really works.\n\nI'm coming at this all from an old school D&amp;D world building perspective.  What kind of world do you get when you apply objective morality to it (The Forgotten Realms setting, for example)?  What sort of world do you get when you DON'T apply objective morality to it (the Dark Sun setting by contrast)?  The tone of each is wildly different.\n\nWe're talking about a story right now where the protagonists just raped a city, razed it to the ground, and put every man woman and child to the sword.  People were burned alive, not out of any tactical advantage that might bring, but because they felt like it.  Sej was fantasizing about hunting children for sport shortly after lamenting about burying the child of a tribesmate.\n\nThe angle the writers are coming from inform us that Winter's Claw is just following the virtues and taboos of their own culture, that questions of good and evil are irrelevant.  Good and evil don't exist in this setting.  And if good and evil don't exist in this setting, then asking whether Volibear is evil or not within the setting's parameters is a meaningless question.\n\nI'm not saying this narrative choice is right or wrong, but I AM saying that it has consequences.","replies":[{"poster":"Metallikaiser","date":"2019-02-21T18:03:46.967+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats all very fair upon thinking about it.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2019-02-21T20:18:32.076+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just wanna call out that you two just had a rational, well reasoned discussion, and arrived on a mutually respected conclusion...  on the forums!\nMy entire view of reality is messed up now.","replies":[{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2019-02-21T21:00:44.002+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WAAARGHbobo,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=W2RIamRE,comment-id=000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-02-21T20:18:32.076+0000)\n\n> My entire view of reality is messed up now.\n\nAmazing what six years and some actual corporate dedication to a long-neglected fanbase can bring about, eh?","replies":[{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2019-02-22T05:34:35.918+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TerraRising,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=W2RIamRE,comment-id=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-02-21T21:00:44.002+0000)\n>\n> Amazing what six years and some actual corporate dedication to a long-neglected fanbase can bring about, eh?\n\nPlease be civil?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2019-02-22T05:35:58.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WAAARGHbobo,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=W2RIamRE,comment-id=000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-02-21T20:18:32.076+0000)\n>\n> I just wanna call out that you two just had a rational, well reasoned discussion, and arrived on a mutually respected conclusion...  on the forums!\n> My entire view of reality is messed up now.\n\nAs a long-standing Void fan it brings me indescribable glee to know that I helped shatter someone's view of reality.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2019-02-22T05:34:02.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Metallikaiser,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=W2RIamRE,comment-id=00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-02-21T18:03:46.967+0000)\n>\n> Thats all very fair upon thinking about it.\n\nI'm glad you think so, I was trying to be as neutral as I could in my presentation.\n\nIt may seem kinda pedantic to drive such a sharp divide between good/evil and virtue/taboo, but what is philosophy except weaponized pedantics?

He's a demigod of war, violence, and bloodshed, and is an animal spirit, something central to the magic and nature of the Freljord.\n\nI'm gonna yank a few snippets from Extra Credits' video _[Force-of-Nature Villains - Giving a Face to Pure Evil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyyE8c27-9Y)_\n\n> The \"Force of Nature\" is akin to the Narrative Villain in the fact that its primary purpose is to enhance the narrative, but how the Force of Nature goes about it is radically different. Where the Narrative Villain is a person, a character with their own needs and desires and motivations, the Force of Nature is the embodiment of some primal aspect of reality.\n>\n> They're more a representation than a character. They allow us as creators to confront the hero with some aspect of themselves, or of society, and through doing so, either learn more about the hero themselves, or explore concepts through the lens of that hero...\n>\n> ...Force of Nature Villains _can be_ a literal force of nature. Or not! Either way, you'll notice that many of these types of villains actually end up being beasts, or gods, which removes the necessity for us as players to understand them on any human level.\n\nVolibear (alongside the other animal demigods in the Freljord) seem to fit the role of \"Force of Nature\", twicefold, even going so far to personify these demigods with reverent titles and an uncanny simplicity in the narrow depiction of what aspect of nature they represent. Volibear, for example, is \"the Unrelenting Bear\", and his aspect has been described as follows:\n\n> Some had rended their souls into the raw, singular emotion of the unrelenting bear’s spirit, _an unchecked confidence bordering on rage._\n\nAs a war-god, Volibear would naturally have only one goal - ceaseless slaughter. Should life still beat in the hearts of anything living, Volibear has not yet come upon it. Even despite his demands for a sacrifice, Volibear obliged Udyr's terms.\n\n> “She makes no pledge to you, bear spirit...We offer only the war and its dead.”\n\nWar in its own right is not holistically evil or good - war is war. It's death, conflict, and strife, sometimes with purpose, and sometimes for the sake of killing. And that is a simple fact that Volibear abides by.\n\nThere is probably as much noble about Volibear as there is ignoble. He did not suffer the Winter's Claw to sacrifice to him, and led his Ursine to battle with them, but he did not make clean or easy work of the killing, either. At the end of the day, he is a demigod - an embodiment of an animal spirit, and a force of nature.
