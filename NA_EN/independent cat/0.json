The only hopes of beating it feel like Soraka getting an early ult off on Zed or getting Hush to proc before he can duplicate even once.\r\n\r\nLook at the screenshot and think about what's happening: Mage buff doublecast + Redemption on all of them + GA. Even without the mage buff and GA, the Redemption alone is ridiculous.","replies":[{"poster":"Krizonar","date":"2019-12-28T12:46:06.208+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://gfycat.com/lonelyexaltedcat","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2019-12-24T23:45:30.899+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it would be fine if he worked like anie: Only one shadow allowed at a time, maybe 2 with mage cap\nBut infinte clones that keep cloneing gets out of hand real quick if you don't have someone with hush shutting him down right befor he gets nasty.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ztoka","date":"2019-12-24T20:44:58.181+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"good stuff huh? probably the most broken thing like u said...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-12-24T22:16:29.210+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I spent a period of TFT doing nothing but trying to stack Zed and ocean/mage to help him duplicate.

Notice how Zed is the only one left, so you had killed the rest of his team, and he didn't do that much damage to you. Did you have a healing debuff?\n\nAlso, you have 6 lights 4 rangers. That just isn't strong, and I'm guessing you had a lack of cc. Instead of 4 rangers, you could have just put in 3 wardens, and also had gone for 5 cost units.\n\nI took the liberty to look at your composition and items. There are a number of things you could have done. Sell Twitch, put those items on ashe. Put in Taric for crystal synergy. Sell Aatrox and put that dragon's claw on an actual tank and replace aatrox with the one on your bench. Sale varus and put those items on vayne, perhaps the dragon's claw too. Then put in another warden in place of Varus, ideally Amumu. You could have taken out Nasus and put in Lucian. Lucian does so much damage, he may have been able to carry you before the mages you played against ulted.\n\nI know this isn't what you want to hear, but Zed just isn't that strong in the games I've been seeing. I just think the lobby you were in had fairly weak compositions.","replies":[]}]}
