Today, I just updated my client and queued up for a ranked game, and lo and behold, the LoL icon pops up and immediately stops responding! Such joy! I end the unresponsive program and try restarting the game from the client. No dice. I try restarting my computer and starting the client backup. Nothing. I close the program after waiting a bit and then the game is already over. I've gone down in rank and forced to wait 10 MINUTES all because the updates refuse to work properly, 3 or 4 times!! What's the deal here?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-02T23:26:37.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When there's some kind of error with a patch, the client will typically notice something is wrong and will revert to a previous patch to try updating again. This doesn't necessarily seem like a patching issue since you're still able to queue for games. This really sounds more like a problem with your network not being able to get as strong of a connection with our servers after that patch.\n\nWe should still be able to get his smoothed out and keep you on the Rift by updating some of your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). Follow the steps in that guide, test it in a custom game, and let me know if League is still becoming unresponsive.","replies":[]}]}
