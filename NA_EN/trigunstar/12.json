Is it really worth to pay $60.00 for this game, or I&#039;m just dumping my money in the dumpster for a game that won&#039;t even last, or stay excited?\r\n\r\nPS: Can anyone list me a very fun game that&#039;s out in 2016 that I can play. I prefer MMORPG&#039;s, paid or free. A game that evolves around playing with people and not solo missions. Doesn&#039;t have to be MMORPG&#039;s, can be any game, but I prefer that it is.","replies":[]}
