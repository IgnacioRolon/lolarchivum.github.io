Instead they worked on Starcraft 2 as if it was War of Warcraft, and Starcraft 2 has lost its spot to League of Legends in terms of entertaining eSports. Broodwar was the most entertaining games to watch online, on stage, and I would of even went to watch the pros play (Bisu vs. Flash, Flash vs. Jaedong.)\n\nI miss the old Broodwar days, and watching those fun entertaining games online. Too bad Blizzard didn't listen to the community when they worked on Starcraft 2, instead they blew the whole thing, and regardless if you like it or not, Starcraft 2 is no where near as entertaining as it once was.\n\nBut I still believe Blizzard can still re-innovate Broodwar and make it the game it suppose to be today. They just have to scrap what they think, and start working on the project. Broodwar can definitely blow League of Legends out of its #1 spot in eSports entertainment.","replies":[]}
