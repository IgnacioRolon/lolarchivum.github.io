Okay.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"New Meta makes ADC useless, unless your a Vayne, Kog'Maw, Kalista, Jinx (questionable), Urgot. I suggest you all stop picking the useless ADC that does 0 damage to this new tank meta. Yes, they do exactly ZERO damage (CLG vs. DIG - Sion vs. Tristana.) With the current way the meta is shifting toward the favor of tanks, picking a non-adc composition in bottom lane is actually very viable against a team that goes hard tank meta. Vayne top actually becomes viable, even in the LCS to deal with the tanks, follow up with a Kog'Maw ADC, and two tank in support/jungler to make up for the deficit of front line.\r\n\r\nThis 5.5 patch opens the variety of strategies, so my suggestion to all you solo-queuer's, stop picking the same composition over and over. Start learning how to create a strategy against team composition. This in itself becomes harder for the lower ranking divisions. Especially in Gold, Silver, and Bronze. If you haven't learn how to create a syn-energy in your team against enemy composition, you'll be in a position of losing more games than winning.","replies":[]}
