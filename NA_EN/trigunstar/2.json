(just because you respect it, doesn't mean you have to believe it in.)\r\npeople who are jocks, cocky, and have no idea what the word humbleness means. (confidence is different from being a cocky ass !#$.)\r\n---\r\nThere's probably more of what i don't appreciate and like in other human being. although, I learn to accept that, and love them for where they are at. sometimes it gets hard. but yea, growing older, i realize i have this trait of not liking some of the other human characteristics. (you have to understand, I didn't really have this kind of personality before.)\r\n\r\nI usually love people for where they are at, and accept them. which I still do, but I never had that trait where I would hate another person type of characteristic trait, until maybe now. it's like increased daily as i grow older. i just can't seem to stand it anymore. doesn't mean i hate you though as a person, i probably love ya. but as far as your personality trait, i don't want to hang out with you because of it.","replies":[]}
