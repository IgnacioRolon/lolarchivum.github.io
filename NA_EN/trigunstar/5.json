What is wrong you guys, really? http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/GD/VYBfkLdG-abortion-is-fine\n\nLet me guess, that evolution theory is clouding your judgment. Making you believe all life is equal, the same, and we're just one part of a big fat organism. It doesn't matter because a human life is now compared to that of a cockroach. When you believe in stupidity, you get stupidity. A human life is far more than bees, butterflies, and birds. Once you kill a baby embryo, regardless if he doesn't feel the pain. It doesn't mean you didn't murder a child out of his life. If you got shot in the head, I can almost promise you, you probably won't feel it either, and it'll be a quick .2 millisecond of your life. That doesn't make it okay to take away your life. Just because a baby embryo doesn't feel pain, have no emotion, that baby embryo is very important and it's its own kind.\n\nYou will never get back that child, what he was made for, what he could of done. He could of been another Einstein to discover and improve what this world has to offer. He could of been a leader that changed the nations for the better. She could of been someone to change and save someone else life in this world. He could of been someone who would go through trials, tribulations, grow up to become a man of God to save people lives. Yet, you think it's okay to go ahead and kill off baby, because evidently in GD, it's okay to have an abortion.\n\nBunch of disgusting lies.\n\n*This thread was deleted by the mods.
