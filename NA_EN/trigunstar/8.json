If you aren't winning 7/10 of your games, for each game that you lose, you'll drop at least 3 division. While winning anything about 7/10 games, you'll climb at least 3 division ACCORDING TO YOUR PREVIOUS S4 ranking.\n\n*At most you'll only gain two tier above or below your current s4 ranking, depending on your provisional matches*\n*The key to the provisional matches is to win at least 7 out of 10 games* This will allow you to stay in your current S4 ranking without dropping a division.* (Assuming that Plat is the highest rank you can reach, Challenger/Master/Diamond, will be adjusted accordingly.)","replies":[]}
