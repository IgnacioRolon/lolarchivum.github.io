So go do it. But don't do it the way the Church has been doing it to glorify Christ. Quit dragging marriage into the Church, quit trying to imitate the Church ceremonial and wedding dress and tradition. If you want your marriage, go have your own ceremonial, you're own way of doing it, but keep those who don't want part of it, away from it.\n\nQuit trying to force people to give you marriage like everyone owes you, and need to know, and need to partake, and need to watch you as you do your little gay marriage vows. Quit trying to have a pastor recite your wedding vow for you, as if, you're trying to mimic and copy the Church traditions.\n\nI can careless if your wedding ceremony is to bow down before a tree, to hold hands, and tie root branches around your neck. Just quit trying to take what was already established for the Church, to forcibly take it for your own, and call it \"marriage.\"","replies":[]}
