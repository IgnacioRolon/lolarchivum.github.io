So how is my MMR not at least balancing? I appreciate that if I weren&#039;t doing well it wouldn&#039;t increase but I am consistantly getting A or S ranks, getting positive kdas (even in lost matches), and farming well. \r\n\r\nhttp://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=MadBaron\r\n\r\nIt just seems a bit unfair, yeah you can have days where you do badly which can mess up your MMR but it shouldn&#039;t be a permanent hinder to your ranked experience, surely you should be able to pull it back and get to a stage where you gain and loss the same elo depending on whether you win or lose.","replies":[{"poster":"Saevum","date":"2018-12-14T01:09:13.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot said they moved players into divisions where they shouldn't be, so they acknowledge its gonna backfire a little bit either in the game or in the forums.

But its really messed up on a lot of accounts because I was expecting to have more team mates that knew what they are doing but Im getting in almost every match someone who is not even Iron.   I mean like full on \"Iv only played vs BOTS\" kind of players.\n\nIt makes dodging VERY important.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-12-13T22:52:26.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"op.gg cant see your real MMR, it just guesses.","replies":[{"poster":"MadBaron","date":"2018-12-13T22:53:26.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I know, wasn't posting it for that, more just to prove I'm not just making up random facts.","replies":[]}]}]}
