If a nations punishment for harassment was a timeout for 5 minutes would we see harassment as commonplace in our society? YUP! If you do nothing about trolling it'll stay in high numbers.

The solutions being punish the people that respond to trolls but make sure the troll is okay and has room to grow and become a better person LMFAO","replies":[]}]}
