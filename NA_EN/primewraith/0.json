If he played 100 games, had a bad game with you, and he said that, perhaps it would have slipped through, unless he keeps doing it and keeps getting reported.\n\nThis board is really confusing me, because there's no real middle ground. People either want everyone who makes them mad to be immediately punished the second they say anything not nice, or they believe people should be able to be raging assholes 24/7, and be left alone.\n\nIf the dude is truly toxic, he'll get banned. If he's not, and he just let his anger get the better of him that one time, let it go. I don't know how many people Riot has on their behavioral review staff, but there are literally millions of players. That shit takes time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nibbly Jimbles","date":"2016-11-12T05:56:44.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"That's Riot's \"Instant Feedback\" system for you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MUSHROOM MIDGET","date":"2016-11-12T05:38:07.099+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"it is kind of interesting.  saying 'you are bad kid' seems more likely to get punishment than 'kys' or when they wish cancer on your mom.","replies":[]},{"poster":"zrWQMdGHtY","date":"2016-11-12T05:10:23.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"I've been called the S--t word and w---e word so many times and nobody got punished that I just pretend that they don't offend me anymore...
