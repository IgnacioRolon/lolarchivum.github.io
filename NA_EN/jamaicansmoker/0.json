But nothing hurts more like when it is a client bug that causes the problem and you still have to endure the unbearable penalty. After the patch of 7.12, I was playing my rank match and the client bugged out and i was unable to log in. That forced my team to do a remake and i received negative LP for it.  After 2 more rank games later, I was in my third match when at 30 minutes in, I was disconnected. Thinking to myself to try and re log in, i encounter this message \"We're unable to log you in because you may be offline\"... With my net working perfectly fine and all. Just to realize that there was a problem that happened after the patch, finally finding a forum to fix the problem i was able to rejoin my match. When the match ended i was greeted a leaver buster penalty. I find this action to be very tedious and quite honestly unfair for me to suffer... Riot, please fix! {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-14T18:39:03.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're impacted by the offline issue currently going on with a leaverbuster, we can take a look.
