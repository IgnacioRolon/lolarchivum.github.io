I spam the lock in button and it just grays out. It causes me to lose 3LP... It's nothing to do with my client or my internet as I've fresh installed the client and my fiance has a setup next to me and nothing like this has ever happened to him.. {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-16T21:27:01.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This actually sounds very odd and is not something I hear of too often.  Given that it doesn't happen to your friance's client at all, it seems like the issue exists somewhere locally on your computer.  While you are able to connect to the internet just fine, you do need to connect directly to our PvP.net Servers when in Champ Select.  If something is blocking this specific connection, the client may not recognize your commands to \"lock in\".  To hopefully resolve this, make sure to complete all of the steps in our [Connection Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664).  It has the most common solutions that should get this fixed up!\n\nLet me know if it doesn't seem to help!","replies":[]}]}
