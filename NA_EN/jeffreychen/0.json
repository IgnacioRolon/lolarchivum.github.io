If I may ask.\n\nI used a davinci xyz 1.0 printer. i am aware of things i can do to make it a better quality, but unfortunately there is a lot of steps because of my printer's factory settings (they dont really want you messing with those settings)\n\n i also heard using a method with acetone gas to smooth out the surfaces, i have experimented with that method and it works pretty well, i just didn't really feel like doing that this time since i thought the paint would smooth it out, but it didnt. in my experience, that only works with enamel paints, and i used acrylic on this project.\n\nanyways, ive only had the printer for a few months and i am still learning how to use it to the best it can.
