To start off, run through each step of the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure League is added as an exception and that your OS is up to date.  Also disable any third party apps that might interact with League along with configuring antivirus settings through the guide.  Once all that is complete, another reinstall should do the trick.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
