We're not refusing to address things.\n\nReal talk - the way you phrased your initial post is not a question, nor an identification of a problem. It's an assertion of your opinion, and quite frankly, it was really, really snarky. From what I can tell, you aren't looking for a discussion, you're just trying to rile people up.

What's Buhru like and where's it located? Got any historical tidbits about it?\n3. Is the language Illaoi speaks specific to Buhru and are there any other details on the language itself to tell?\n4. What are the Serpent Isles? I'm led to believe they're a part of the Blue Flame archipelago where the Serpentine flows through but I dunno.\n5. Could you explain a bit about the nature of Illaoi's idol? Is it a literal or metaphorical \"eye of god\" so to speak?\n6. Illaoi has a line for when she buys {{item:3053} saying \"Sterak? It is the fury of the **Mother** I will bring.\" The mother is obviously Nagakabouros so who is Sterak in relation? Her consort? One of her direct children?\n7. On that note what's the historical and religious significance of sea monsters in Illaoi's religion? Do they have a specific connection to Nagakabouros?\n8. Linked in with the above, what are Runeterran Hydras like? Are they real or mythological in universe?\n9. Considering the oceanic themes present in Illaoi's religion what's her thoughts on our resident sea-dwellers: {{champion:105}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:111}}?\n10. I imagine there's a few good myths and legends about Nagakabouros. Care to divulge any? Would love to hear what the story is behind her origins.\n11. Final question! What's a Paylangi? Illaoi called people it in Shadow and Fortune and I'm just sitting here wondering what the sod it means.\n\nEDIT: Sod forgot one. FINAL QUESTION:\n\n- Is there some correlation between Nagakabouros, the souls of living beings, and the forever mysterious demons and darkin?

Illaoi's people aren't really aware of other religions (though they have other gods too).  So they haven't needed a name for it.\n\n2.  Buhru is an island near Bilgewater.  Both are in the Serpent Isles' chain.\n\n3.  The various islands have distinct dialects-- similar to Scottish vs English vs Welsh.    Burhun is the one of the most common dialects as it is especially suited for sea travel.\n\n4.    Bilgewaterian's and many others have adopted the translation of the natives' name for the island chain.  Blue Flame is the old Valorian name for the island chain-- and you would be unlikely to hear anyone but Demacian's call it that.\n\n5.  Eye of God is its title.
