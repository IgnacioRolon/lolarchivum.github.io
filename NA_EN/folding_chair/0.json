On my old laptop, I could crank the settings all the way up, turn on Vsync, and it'd be super butter smooth. But now with my new build, after doing the same, I get really weird stutters and tears.\r\n\r\nOld specs\r\n\r\n8gb ddr3 1600mhz\r\nI7 (laptop) 2.4ghz \r\nGtx 860m 4gb\r\nRunning at 1080p resolution.\r\n\r\nNew specs\r\n\r\n16gb ddr3 1866mhz\r\nI5-4690 3.7 ghz (oc)\r\nGTX 1060 3gb (oc)\r\nRunning on the same monitor as the laptop was before.\r\n\r\nThank you! {{champion:131}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-11T23:36:18.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your PC may just need some tuning up for a smooth game, being new and all.  Run through the steps in the [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide to help with that.
