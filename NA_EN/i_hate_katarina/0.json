Even though yes, I know we have our own server there (SEA) I'm here because my laptop IS INCREDIBLY slow so I'm on a mac playing on NA since Garena SEA doesn't offer the mac version.\r\n\r\nBut anyways, I have only been getting these problems recently and everything was perfectly fine for like 10 months when I was playing? \r\nMy FPS is usually at a STABLE 60, and as for my ms it's usually about 250-400? I'm not sure. But when it's really bad it's usually around 560-650.\r\n\r\nAs I said before I'm on a mac and I have NO IDEA what to do now to fix this. My internet works perfectly fine and speedtest results show that my connection is actually is normal. I'm kinda losing my patience because I'm losing TONS of games because of this.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me please? Thanks in advance to anyone that actually replies to this post.","replies":[{"poster":"Swissmas","date":"2015-10-21T16:10:24.019+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had a problem with ping since the last update. Before then, I'd have the occasional ping spikes but it usually wasn't that bad. But since the last patch, I've had ping spikes every few minutes. Also, at least once a game I have a severe lag spike where I stop seeing attack animations and can't target or attack anything. I've tried waiting a few minutes, but I usually have to disconnect and reconnect to the game a few times to get it back to normal. It's getting ridiculous, and on the verge of unplayable. I hate making my friends lose games because I can't stay in game. I've spent over 20 minutes trying to get the game to where it's playable and for my ping to go down. I'm about ready to just stop playing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TwstedDisco","date":"2015-10-21T17:22:00.877+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am currently In Taiwan and for the last week i have been having some major connection and lag issues.

I'm also from SEA region and I play on OCE and NA and I'm going through the same thing. I feel like my internet is just fine, I did a speed test and its around 5 mbps (Normal speed here). I get like 270 ms on Oce which is quite high considering the fact that my usual ping there is supposed to be around 125 - 140 ms. Same goes for the NA server I get around 300 to 370+ ms and my usual ping there is 200 ms.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Hate Katarina","date":"2015-10-22T14:43:17.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Played yesterday and today. \n\nYesterday evening connection was so bad I could not even play and had to result in playing bot.

In both instances, I had perfect connection for the first 3 or so minutes..Got first blood and then \"b\" and, when I got back to lane, the lag started.
