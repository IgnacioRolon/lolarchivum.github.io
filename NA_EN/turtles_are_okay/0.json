If you want to submit evidence, do so via a support ticket. The forums are mostly just community members who cannot issue punishments to players in game. Even the Green and Purple named people on the post are just regular community members who VOLUNTEER to help manage the boards. Emphasis on volunteer because they don't get paid ny Riot and are not Riot employees.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2019-07-03T03:33:33.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay make sure to post the logs so we can see that youre not leaving things said out of the story like most people who post about their punishments.","replies":[{"poster":"Turtles Are Okay","date":"2019-07-07T20:43:38.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Telephone Booth,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=u9wuBinm,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2019-07-03T03:33:33.216+0000)\n>\n> Okay make sure to post the logs so we can see that youre not leaving things said out of the story like most people who post about their punishments.\n\nWill do.\n\nAll my tickets were unfortunately deleted to showcase my last ban. In a game, someone called me \"super toxic\".\n\nI've said \"man idk, this elo mental is weird. If games can be turned in d3, surely you can turn them in gold elo.\" and \"idk man, you've got a d3 sona 65% wr, you kinda just have to wait late game\".\n\nThat's toxic.\n\nYup.","replies":[]}]}]}
