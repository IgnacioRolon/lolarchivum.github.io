As per tracking:\r\n\r\n93% of the players flame and I mean, actual flame, like \"f*** you\" or in the same league. If they don't flame, although inconclusive, they either go mental boom a lot of times or straight up give up and troll.\r\n\r\nWhile I don't personally care, I've worked to get this account's MMR restored and I've made **it with a huge win-rate....but I lost like 7 promos**. I literally only lost games in promos because of trolls. One time, there was a Singed who decided to run it down and went 0-20 and it got to me and I started complaining every game using the in-game chat.\r\n\r\nWhat's going on with this game? I never talk unless someone is talking or is doing something ludacrious but it seems the community has completely, totally turned into a hellhole and I myself am becoming the very people I despise.","replies":[{"poster":"5 Dollar Holler","date":"2019-12-12T14:59:35.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gotta /mute all before every match.\n\nPeople communicate useful information more with pings than chat anyway.

If you are playing soloq, consider flex. It is a lot chiller and has less raging tryhard brats, due to being a \"casual troll queue\". Which is comical because the players typically try harder and are more serious.","replies":[]}]}
