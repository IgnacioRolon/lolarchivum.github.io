There are no clear outliers that stomp games, there are ways to counteract them and even if ranked is more or less a coin flip, the game itself is, for the most part, well thought out. A lot of champions work on bot lane, as well as top lane, same goes for mid. The jungle is very varied as well, same for supports.\r\n\r\nThe events, the updates, the new modes, the testing, the reworks, the client work, the esports quality, the rewards. All in all, it's pretty good.\r\n\r\nI also heard and saw myself on a friend that plays quite a bit but doesn't buy stuff that you get a **LOT of free stuff**. There's no other game out there that gives out so much for free.\r\n\r\nThank you, Riot, for making a great game.\r\n\r\n---\r\nOf course there will always be issues such as ranked LP gains and they're not always minor, but Riot's been mostly responsive.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-22T02:35:28.407+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Playerbase dropping, revenue dropping, every other rework gutted, League is the BEST IT'S EVER BEEN!\n\nk","replies":[{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2019-06-22T02:48:48.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0odMAdjx,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-06-22T02:35:28.407+0000)\n>\n> Playerbase dropping, revenue dropping, every other rework gutted, League is the BEST IT'S EVER BEEN!\n> \n> k\n\nOh noes!

Getting stomped in the first 15 means is mostly a GG.\n\nIf you get stomped and don't FF you better hope and pray your team knows how to stop the bleeding because I tell you what in my elo they don't and will continue to skirmish and chase people even when we are down 10-15 kills. Early game champions decide how the game is going to go. It's either going to be GG at 15 or they won't do anything and the game can maybe hit 35-40 mins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Bad Touch","date":"2019-06-22T03:14:01.403+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ZephyrDrake,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0odMAdjx,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-06-22T01:08:01.094+0000)\n>\n> Yeah, because doing nothing but waveclear and farm for 40+ minutes and then having a single fight dictate who won the game is soooooo much better.\n\nYou obviously never played it then if you think that's all there was to it...\n\nIn essence however, yes I do prefer a slower pace game with less one shotting people under tower for Youtube highlight reels. I got into PC gaming mostly with games like Stronghold (SSI version), Populous, Archon Ultra, Dark Legions and later moved into stuff like Warcraft, Dune, C&amp;C, Diablo 1 ect, though I had played a bit of stuff before that those are the ones I fell into loving PC gaming with.

If you look at at every champion rework it came with more mobility. If you look at minions changes it forces shorter games. If you just look at the amount of gold income compared to earlier seasons it's pretty insane. Many summoners were outright removed, and the game began to be balanced around Flash+TP/Heal/Ignite/Smite. Jungle and support items made first buys an utter no brainer as well. Warding went from an investment that required proper pay to reward, to something that was just \"hit this on CD.\" All of the thinking is don't for you in current league, whoever has higher APM wins by default.\n\nGiven the two options I'd gladly take chess over dodgeball. Instant gratification isn't as much fun as a more cerebral approach for me. A lot of that is because, for a league player, I'm fairly damn old. I'm never going to out reaction time a teenager.

Unless you made a mistake of catastrophic proportions games would go to 40+ mins every single time and everything would be decided in a single teamfight. That was how the vast majority of games played out. Sure there were some where someone splitpushed one team to death or the incredibly rare case of people actually getting such a massive lead in the early game that games ended rather quickly but those type of games were the exception and a rarity.\n\nI am sorry that you prefer games where NOTHING mattered at ANY stage that wasn't late game. I am sorry that only slow games are deemed worthy and that somehow playing fast requires no brain or thought whatsoever. I don't care if the game ends in 20 mins or 50 mins. I care that people cannot just go to lalala land and not care about EVERY SINGLE PHASE OF THE GAME because the late game is something that was a given instead of earned.","replies":[{"poster":"The Bad Touch","date":"2019-06-22T09:49:49.048+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ZephyrDrake,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0odMAdjx,comment-id=0001000000010000,timestamp=2019-06-22T08:08:27.540+0000)\n>\n> i have been playing since season 2.
