It means a lot!\n\nFirst we can take their responses from this thread:\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4686014\n\nAnd then we can take into account what has been said on Morello's twitter about not nerfing him because of public outcry in defense of him.\n\nWhat does that leave us with?  It leaves us with knowing that Riot is scared of altering Lee Sin in any meaningful way that will take him out of the #1 Jungler spot in the game.  Riot doesn't know what would happen if they nerfed the one champion holding back 80% of jungle champions from excelling in their game and so they refuse to touch him.  They must figure that Lee Sin keeping all those champions out of the competitive scene must make for a pretty easy to balance competitive scene because Riot then just has to cycle the other top junglers to the Lee Sin bar and then back below the Lee Sin bar to make it look like they are actually working on the problem as a whole.  We've seen this before with FotM jungle champions.  Nasus, Voli, Kha'zix, Rengar, Nocturne, Pantheon, etc.  Every champion that has been able to hold a candle to Lee Sin in the competitive scene has been nerfed and are back into being unusable.  Riot will NEVER nerf him into being weaker than any other jungler.  \n\nHe will always be the mobility king, the smite stealing king, the invasion king, and an expert in towerdiving and relocating enemy champions.  He has everything a jungler and indeed a bruiser wants with ZERO downsides.  The only thing that he doesn't have that would make him stronger, is ranged auto attacks.  There was a post in the aforementioned thread that I linked by Ghostcrawler stating that energy costs could be increased to make him weaker.  This is the wrong way to go down.  Energy costs do not fix the problem that is Lee Sin's kit.  His problem is that there is absolutely no counterplay to anything he does.  \n\nThe rework that Riot had slated for the PBE for him many months ago fixed this problem.  It gave him clear weaknesses but many people complained because while it gave him more weaknesses it didn't give him any \"compensation buffs\" which in my opinion are the dumbest things I've ever head of and should ONLY be implemented if you are taking a slightly stronger than normal champion and changing it to a slightly weaker than normal champion, then compensation buffs are a good way to balance that out.  Riot will forever continue to have Lee Sin be the jungler bar because he \"feels good to play and make plays on\" while they ignore the fact that while yes, he can be used in high elo for some pretty epic plays, he is also absurdly safe and easy to pick up on.   The champion has an absurdly low skill floor, if it was any lower we would have to dig underneath the Garen foundation to find it.  He simply has no drawbacks and Riot refuses to rework him into having any because of peer pressure.\n\nI know this post is rambling and I'm sorry, but Riot needs to fix this problem.  Don't just stick it on the \"Soon(TM)\" back burner and use the competitive scene and Worlds as your reasoning.  Man up and start working on him.  Xelnath, good man imo but wrong, stated that nerfing or reworking Lee Sin this close to Worlds would be the equivalent to the Trinity Force changes before S3 Worlds.  This is completely incorrect.  Trinity Force changes impacted the game FAR harder than any single champion change or rework ever could because it is an item, and anyone can build an item.  Worse yet, it was a staple item on many champions.  So do not compare Lee Sin changes to Trinity Force changes.  It will not impact the meta, it will free up a large selection of champion picks, and it will just free up a ban if nothing else.  He is a champion, not an item.  If he's not picked or banned in the game, he won't impact the game.  Stop using this logic Xelnath, I know you are smarter than this, I've read and absorbed your other threads, please stop trying to make this comparison work.\n\nIn short, Riot won't nerf Lee Sin because he will free up champion picks in the competitive scene and Riot will then be forced to attempt to balance them and they will be forced to deal with people crying about losing their blind monk.  Riot continues to back up this reasoning with logic such as \"Lee Sin has no weaknesses that we can use to make him weaker and we don't like to just invent weaknesses\"  and \"Lee Sin being changed so close to Worlds would invalidate months of practice and expertise, much like the Trinity Force changes before S3 Worlds did\"  Riot's logic never ceases to infuriate me.","replies":[{"poster":"PWYFF","date":"2014-07-15T00:15:43.606+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":12,"body":"That's an insane rabbit hole of a discussion so I won't hop into that thing, but one thing about Lee Sin is that he's a game of balancing pros and cons and what they mean for the health of the game.\n\nHonestly speaking, Morello's statement re: Lee Sin being an \"untouchable\" champion due to public perception is a bit binary, so I'll re-examine it:\n\nWhen we say we have difficulties approaching a champion due to perception problems, it's partially public outcry but it's also due to the fact that **perception is so inherent to the game**. Given that League is based on a player's preferences and capabilities, it's obvious that champion tiers will also be tailored to the common thread. Only in a 'solved' competitive game can objective truths (ie: character power) can come forth. In chess there might be a dozen openings that lead to a meaningful game, whereas the rest have been hashed out so much that they're inconsequential. Fighting games are another example of this, where a champion tier list is *completely* based on public perception, and one player's performance at an international event (Isai's Jigglypuff in SSB64, GamerBee's Adon in SF4, etc) can completely warp what's considered to be objectively the best.\n\nIn this regard, League is such a strong online community that group-think is virtually inevitable and only the stubborn players end up breaking the mold. At S3 worlds when Zed / Ahri / Fizz /  Gragas / Orianna were the staples, Faker picked a Riven into Zed and ended up drawing a ban as a result of it. There are tons of cases where solo queue heroes would pubstomp a pro player with a unique champion, ultimately resulting in that champion becoming the hot new fad in competitive play. What happens after that? Every aspiring competitive player picks up on that champion, and suddenly we have solo lane Soraka beating the crap out of top / mid lane.\n\nThis is a super long way of saying that yes, we're dedicated to preserving game health above all else, but because perception is so closely tied to game health and group-think is so dominant, we find ways to navigate that space through constant communication paired with nuanced design changes to nudge the game in certain ways.  \n\nIn terms of actual tangible work: we're looking at Lee Sin because we agree he's distorting the early game jungle. But it's not just him. It's early aggro junglers like Elise and Evelynn. We took a step back for a patch because we wanted to take a moment to consider how the tank jungle changes had fallen out. I have a very strong suspicion that those will have a larger impact than most believe (we're already seeing a shift in solo queue play, but competitive is actually quite slow on the uptake) but making gut calls is often when we get punched in the face (ie: we *did* think Trist needed buffs on top of item changes, but looks like that went a little too far). Game design and balance is an art more than a science, and it's tough to consider the layers - how does this affect objective game health? How does this affect perceived game health? How quickly will teams adapt? Are there any competitive teams willing to experiment?\n\nFor me, the question that comes after is there seems to be a strong opinion (in this passionate thread) that players would much rather us completely thrash Lee Sin so that he's out of the way, rather than creating a sustainable design decision that creates weaknesses but doesn't just cram him into D-tier. Is Lee Sin healthier for the game when he doesn't exist at B, A, or S tier? If Lee Sin gets nerfed, do we get Elise, Evelynn, Rengar, and Jarvan IV in all games? Does that point to a systemic problem with aggro-junglers focused on early game? Is the game objectively better to play and watch when Volibear is jungling, or Lee Sin? I'm unsure if there are solid answers here and going for a democratic voice results in the loudest voice, maybe not the best one for game health.","replies":[{"poster":"Shenron","date":"2014-07-15T01:09:38.904+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"> For me, the question that comes after is there seems to be a strong opinion (in this passionate thread) that players would much rather us completely thrash Lee Sin so that he's out of the way, rather than creating a sustainable design decision that creates weaknesses but doesn't just cram him into D-tier.

If Elise and Evelynn are then launched up to the forfront, well, their kits have more weaknesses and counterplay than Lee Sin's which has zero and those weaknesses and counterplay can be expanded upon to weaken them.   \n\nLee Sin's proposed rework from months ago solved this problem and imo, was the best solution Riot could've come up with, I was sad to see it get shelved.","replies":[{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2014-07-15T01:33:48.348+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":">Lee Sin's proposed rework from months ago solved this problem and imo, was the best solution Riot could've come up with, I was sad to see it get shelved.\n\nyea, i really agree...the rework/shift looked very promising, it´s such a shame you gave in to the tears of a minority.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Evelyn Endwise","date":"2014-07-15T17:23:29.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2014-07-15T18:22:33.899+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally enjoy his passive immensely...it gives him a very nice flow weaving in auto-attacks between spell-circles, really one of the few things that makes the difference between real good lees and \"alright\" lees.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2014-07-15T01:52:09.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First, thank you so much for this response, I learned a lot from it.\n\nSecond, I was wondering if you think Lee Sin even needs to be nerfed (especially in a 'meaningful way' as this thread brought up)? I don't play Lee Sin, I personally have no stake in the matter if he were nerfed into the ground, but I honestly don't see him as as big a problem as a lot of people. Sure, I've played with a lot of good Lee Sins, but I've played with many, many bad ones (and more often than not ones who think they're better than they are, *maybe* do okay early then just rage for the rest of the game. If there was one change to be made, it's for a name change to Lee Salt: Most Toxic Champion in the Universe).\n\nThirdly, I was wondering if you could comment on the direction/approach to the Jungle that Riot is looking towards? It seems like currently there is an emphasis on bringing up tanky/utility junglers to compete with the early/aggro junglers, I'm just curious because the Jungler is in a unique position where they can affect every lane in the game, in a way giving the most power/responsibility to the jungler in terms of game outcome (all other things being equal). I guess the fear too is (and this will probably never be the case, but just a bit of straw maning to make a point) that junglers will be powerful to the point where the lanes are just freeze farming, waiting until the jungler makes a play before doing anything. It's just worrying that the jungler will be too big a pivot point for the game, and I'm just curious about the ways Riot is making sure that the Jungler doesn't have overwhelming influence on the game. Thanks again!","replies":[{"poster":"PWYFF","date":"2014-07-15T03:13:23.724+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"You raise some really good points across the board. For your first Lee Sin point, I'm pretty sure his high strengths are what make him so inhibitive as a champion, which is a super problem we face when we look at champions who are iconic for their strength. Kayle is a good example here where she's being picked non-stop because she's so damn good at everything. It's a weird knife's edge conundrum here.\n\nFor Lee Sin, his strength goes: insane early game pressure, high mobility, high damage, versatile kit. When we first looked to change Lee Sin (hello rework), we got a ton of pushback because nobody saw those as insane strengths. There's some argument that we nerfed certain champions so Lee was inevitably the best, but Elise is also close to 100% priority and she got some reductions along the way as well. We haven't touched Evelynn. We buffed Jarvan IV. Rengar was broken due to a bug with double-proccing on-hit effects so we'll see how our changes affect him. The only major jungler threat we really touched was Kha'Zix and, to a lesser degree, Pantheon (bugfix delight). Kha'Zix might exist as a jungler in a world without the top tier junglers, and I still think Pantheon is waiting to get in there.\n\nRegardless, we did back down on those because if the community backlash is so strong to a change, you do have to wonder who's out of touch. It's one thing to be a design team so confident in your changes that you're immune to feedback, but we pride ourselves on our feedback loop and listening to players. This is a core attribute to us and one we value inherently. Sometimes I wonder if we should engineer favorable situations to change contentious champions before doing so (oh man wouldn't that be funny).\n\nRegardless, I think Lee Sin is actually problematic for competitive play, I'm less convinced for less than diamond level play. He's played with tradeoffs at a lot of levels, but I'd also agree he has very few risks for being such a \"high risk\" champion.\n\nAs for the jungle itself, I think we have a significant problem in the game where players dislike losing \"carry\" agency. In an ideal world I don't think we want a specific guy who's gonna be like \"you win or lose on me.\" All champions should express skill and should equally contribute to a game being won. We talk about wanting junglers to carry from the jungle, I think we meant that we wanted the potential for junglers to have the strategical niche wherein a team can create a \"jungle-carry\" oriented comp. Protect the Yi? Maybe that's a little idealistic given the scenario of the game. Regardless, I think in an ideal world we can see multiple 'styles' of junglers, but that they don't get picked in a silo. Instead, they're chosen to support and collaborate with a cohesive team strategy. Maokai for a protect the Kog comp, maybe Elise for a pick 'n roll comp, maybe Lee Sin for an early aggro comp, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2014-07-15T05:09:06.964+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you again for your response!\n\nI'm wondering if you think Lee Sin is having trouble similar to LeBlanc/Kassadin, too (where it seems like their themes are sort of troubling for the game). LeBlanc and Kassadin are supposed to be highly mobile assassins, which is very difficult for most champions to deal with; at the same time, it's difficult to change this because that's who these champions are. Lee Sin is supposed to have very high early game pressure in addition to high mobility, so I feel like a lot of his strengths are natural and warranted (at least in a vacuum). It's a little different I guess, because LeBlanc and Kassadin's mobility is also tied to their damage output in a pretty significant way, where Lee Sin has sort of a designated damage spell (Q) and escape (W) (unless you're inSec-ing around) (plus LeBlanc must either use ult or go back to where she W-ed from, and Kassadin has a cooldown between ult casts, where Lee Sin doesn't, you can case W before you even land the second part of your Q. Also Lee Sin doesn't have long-term limits on mobility due to him using Energy instead of Mana).\n\nI'm wondering too if you think there is a great focus on Lee Sin play because of tradition? I'm not suggesting this be done, but I'm wondering how far Lee Sin could be nerfed before people stop playing him. In my personal experience, there were a lot of champions that had sharp declines in popularity post nerf/reworks (Riven and Kha'Zix are two that come to mind). At the same time, it seems a bit odd to say Lee Sin is a 'safe' pick (ie. would be a good measuring stick), sort of how Orianna is in mid lane (at professional level, at least). It's as you said, he seems to have too little risk for the reward he offers.\n\nOn a related note, I'm wondering if y'all ever looks at balancing for a specific level of play, and how that may work, since it seems very difficult. I suppose one way is gating with difficult mechanics (for example, Syndra and Orianna are very popular at professional levels, but I seldom see either at my elo), but I've also heard many talk about League being more strategy focused than mechanic focused, as such most champions aren't meant to be incredibly mechanic intensive. \n\n> Regardless, I think in an ideal world we can see multiple 'styles' of junglers, but that they don't get picked in a silo. Instead, they're chosen to support and collaborate with a cohesive team strategy.\n\nI'm wondering if now the direction you're taking is to try to make each one of these comps equally/situationally viable? It sounds like this could be an interesting rock-paper-scissors sort of thing, except where scissors can beat rock if you know how to use them well enough? It always does seem disappointing when people say that a team already won in champion select, though. I guess I'm wondering where the balance is in making team comps that are very powerful and work well while still making them have meaningful weaknesses that can be played around (so you have to put your opponent in a position to play on your terms, and not just simply overpower them).\n\n> Sometimes I wonder if we should engineer favorable situations to change contentious champions before doing so (oh man wouldn't that be funny).\n\nSometimes I wonder if y'all are actually doing this :P. Honestly, I would probably applaud your success, since the game has gotten so complex it seems really difficult to fully engineer something like this *and succeed* (not sure about you, but I never thought solo-lane Soraka would make it into professional play).\n\nCheers!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2014-07-15T01:46:52.704+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"I do not want to see Lee Sin trashed, he is a powerful champion and absolutely needs to remain powerful.

This is where the hate comes in, his overwhelming power that allows no counterplay, is readily available and is seen too often in games.  \n\nIf possible the only change id like for Lee Sin is for him to be harder to use, so that you need lots of practice and skill to use him, beyond playing 100-200 games and seeing how others use him.

Again, I'm gonna have to call you out here, Lee is NOT a universal ban by any stretch of the imagination, he draws about a 40% ban rate, which is on the high side for sure, but not enough that he needs a rework so that he is \"harder to use\", which is the only way you could feasibly achieve that. \n\n\"...one of my friends carried the game on his first time and every game after with him.\" I'm just calling bullshit on that. Not even challenger players can carry every game, regardless of who they're on. Your entire post has been grossly exaggerating his power vs. skill curve. \n\nI would say Lee shouldn't have the way his kit works touched, though he could use the Renekton treatment: Move some of his power around so he's less oppressive early, and slightly more influential later. Early jungle pressure from high-impact junglers like Lee, Elise, and Evelynn is part of what's making the meta so stale right now, keeping their kits in-tact so they are still fun to play while moving some power around seems like the perfect solution to the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Trozers","date":"2014-07-16T06:02:15.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am also a high diamond jungler and I agree with every point that Magus Godspawn made. \n\n\"Lee Sin is NOT easy to use.

He works with all metas and team Comps and that is a reason for concern as why pick someone else when you can pick lee sin, and if the enemy picks lee you just go with your planed comp's backup jungler. Last year you (Riot Games) said you dont want a jack of all trades champion to exist and you were making changes and reworks to avoid those types of champions. \n\nSome people say thats what makes him perfectly balanced, But if that was the case we would see more jungle diversity as he should be sub-optimal compared to other champs for a team comp but instead we see that he is picked ore and more which leads us to why he is picked all the time, and that is his ability to be in any role as the jungler being he can pickup on the tanky side if his top is losing and he loses nothing or if his bot is having it rough he can be build more damage and still retain a large amount of tanky presence with how his kit and stats are.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Naelarstrasz","date":"2014-07-15T06:00:49.926+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"http://lol.gamepedia.com/Lee_Sin\n\nBipassed or not, he is still an issue.

For example: I'm not a great player and everytime i play Yasuo, im usually mediocre and not wrecking faces, like pro players do. But i think, it should be exactly that way!

Lee Sin single handedly outclasses the stock of junglers. \n\nI have a problem with several champs. Renekton, Braum, Thresh... I'll get around to bitching about them too. But there's only two ways that the meta can be damaged into allowing more champs to be present.\n\nNerf the ones that outclass everything, or bring the underclass on par. I don't care what way is taken. Just... SOMETHING. I do NOT want to play ranked with such an atmosphere... \"Play this or lose\". That's how it will end up being if Riot doesn't change things. it's how it's been for those who have been up there. Riot Shoutcasters even say it...\n\nThough back to lee Sin in particular. He's been doing this since release. I'm glad to see his patch history has been he's gotten a lot of nerfing, but it has to speak volumes when... Through all this nerfing, he's managing a 90% pick/ban rate in tournaments. Then, when you compare him to other champs, he has everything up over them to explain why.\n\nThe pros pick the outclassiest of champs to win. They HAVE to in order for their living to work.

High Damage early game, moderate damage mid game, lower damage late game, Attack Speed boost, Resource regen,  Dash-To-Enemy, Dash-To-Ally, Lifesteal, spellvamp, Aoe Damage+TrueSight, Movement Speed+Attack Speed slow, Knockback-onPrimary+Mimicked-Ult-damage+Knock up.\n\nIf you're going to give a champ that much utility, he can't be having Ratio's that allow him to just build one damage item for damage and blow up early game on the enemy team if they pick ANYTHING besides the second or third best. Your Jungler pool is super small at his hand alone. Either the removed junglers get put on his level, or he gets put on their level. :( \n\nOn concession, I do NOT want to see Lee Sin removed from play utterly. I'm only evil enough to see him on par with the rest. His damage power has to exist. If he's early game, his damage power shouldn't be ending at 40 minutes... It should be ending at 25 minutes in if he didn't snowball. He's a utility ball, not a wrecking ball.\n\n(Pardon any rants.

His winrate has been sub-par for ages at this point. it must have sat at 47% for 5 months at least, and recently it's been getting even lower, dipping down to 45-46%(stats from lolking, in pro games I believe he almost exactly at a 50% winrate right now) , however it is almost unanimously agreed upon that lee sin is a very strong champion.

When you want to cut something away, you can buff another spot, and I think the AS buff on his passive was definitely the right spot for a slight buff.\n\nHis W survivability and mobility is a spot where Riot can definitely hit him. \nOnly give the shield to the target he charges at (if it is a champion). No more double shield. Remove the sustain and give him some defensive stats for 3 seconds (Armor/MR) to force him into a better timing instead of healing up in the jungle faster than any other champ.\nYou could also nerf the range.\nThe nerf that would do the most, but would never get through, is to remvoe the ward hopping. It would force Lee to actually flank the enemy and get in with his Q. But it is already way too deap in his kit and the players heads to actually remove it.\n\nHis Q should also have a meaningful weakness. Currently the costs are low, the CD gets pretty low and the dmg, scaling and execute dmg are great. The risk is nearly 0, because you can always land it and decide to not go in (What is one of Vi's weaknesses, especially if she wants to lane: Once her Q is charged, she has to decide to go in or not, and if she misses, a lot of dmg and CC got dodged while she stands right next to you without that much dmg left).\nHow can you make the desicion more important?\n1. reduce the extra cast range of the second Q tp +100 down from +200. Now Lee would have to chase the enemy more or stick closer to them when he doesn't want to jump in instantly. If an enemy is faster, he now needs to decide in time.\n2. Increase the CD by 3 sec. If Lee's second Q deals dmg, the CD gets reduced by 2.5 sec (the other 0.5 are there as a direct nerf early and to make up for the bit stronger CDR later).\n\nHis E: the AS slow is something that a lot of people don't realize, but it is super strong. It is an AOE MS/AS slow with dmg with a good base dmg and AD scaling. \nReduce the AS slow to 10-30% (50% of the MS slow).\nNow deals physical dmg.\n\nR: reduce knockback range to 1000 down from 1200. Reduce the knockup and knockback duration to 0.75 seconds down from 1.\nIncrease the CD to 100/80/60 sec.\n\n\nI overall do not like most of these changes I suggested. I think that they are nerfs for the sake of bringing lee down, while the problem is actually that his kit and his \"characteristic playstyle\" that should not get touched involves everything except for being a magic dmg caster (tanky bruiser assassin with high mobility, good sustain and utility with the only weakness being the late game, where you can't be as muc ha bruiser as other champs- what is not a problem due to the W, E and R utility.\n\nThe best way for Lee would be a huge change of one of his 3 basic skills and number changes to the others. He needs to lose the offensive (base and scaling) power of Q, the defensive + mobility power of W or the utility from E.\n\n\nAbout Eve:\nQ gives her a very high amount of DPS, while E gives her burst and DPS and W allows her to stick to the enemy jungler, and her passive forces you to spam pink wards. That creates situations where Eve gets ahead a bit and from there on she can force the enemy jungler out of his jungle while also having good ganks.\nThink about a Maste Yi that has his W, E and R at lvl 3, is invisible and can AA while moving.\n\nReduce her W stack power. Her W active + R slow need to be enough to chase a target. If not, the enemy deserves to get away.\nRemove the mana reg on her Passive. \n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2014-07-15T01:40:39.147+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">Is Lee Sin healthier for the game when he doesn't exist at B, A, or S tier?\n\nas long as elise, eve and vii stay untouched probably not...\n\nBut I know from my perspective the game would be much better if Yasuo wouldn´t exist.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeeDark","date":"2014-07-16T02:49:58.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see how it is that difficult, honestly.
