I was just curious noticing that he hasn&#039;t gotten a skin since late **2011** and the only other champions fitting this same criteria include {{champion:14}} , {{champion:44}}  and {{champion:83}}  (all of whom either has had a VU recently or awaiting upcoming VU&#039;s before receiving new skins).\r\n\r\nI apologize if similar topics may or may not exist; however, I was just curious to know the current state of Kennen. Both Shen and Akali appear to have some kit reworks coming up in 2016, so I was just disappointed to see a lack of Kennen updates (aside from his texture update earlier this year) for quite a long while now.\r\n\r\nI love the new skins and updates that the yordles have been getting as they&#039;ve been brimming with personality recently with new models! However, I would like to see Kennen get some of this love too in terms of appearance and animations as well.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! I&#039;d appreciate a response whenever possible.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-13T18:01:43.463+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey SlyTactician,\n\nKennen isn't in the update bin like champions such as Taric or Poppy, which means he's totally eligible to receive a skin. That said, I'm unfortunately not able to discuss if he has a skin in development or not. :c","replies":[{"poster":"SlyTactician ","date":"2015-11-13T23:32:39.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's fine, I'm glad to know he's been acknowledged about and I really do appreciate the response! :)\n\nI understand the circumstances, and thanks so much for replying Katey (especially at a busy time with all the preseason updates). I was just interested to know if he might get a skin soon or not since it's been a while. xD \n\nThough I am certain that a future skin of his will be epic; however, you guys make it. ^^ Keep up the great work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XIII Vanitas","date":"2015-11-13T19:44:52.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Z3ll4R0U,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-11-13T18:01:43.463+0000)\n>\n> Hey SlyTactician,\n> \n> Kennen isn't in the update bin like champions such as Taric or Poppy, which means he's totally eligible to receive a skin.

Unfortunately the Permanent Champion Price Reduction page on Riot's site is rarely updated, so we only know the 6300 IP champions that are going down 1 tier.","replies":[]}]}]}
