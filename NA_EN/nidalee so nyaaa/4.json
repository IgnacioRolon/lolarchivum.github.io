Even if you're not duoing with somebody, they know how to follow up with ganks/disengage. Rek'sai requires a lot of coordination, not just with engages (not too different from gnar's engages, you can just go in) but with ganks/vision control.\n\nHer vision and map pressure is why she is picked in LCS but not soloq, and the strengths she does have with tremor sense and ulti is very good for an individual rek'sai player to atleast ping or something, with the tremor nerf its nearly impossible to accurately detect where somebody is. Sure it's a \"hint\" in FoW which is better than nothing at all, which is strong enough for LCS, but not soloq play. \n\nAt this point the only people below plat elo that pick rek either are rek mains or she's their pocket pick for a tank team comp. \n\nIf they want to go through with nerfing all her LCS \"op\" traits, then they should atleast captilize and buff her damage, since ulti, tunnel, and tremor is so weak it should feel more rewarding for using them properly than wasteful with their cooldown nerfs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ForgiveColour","date":"2016-08-16T02:14:00.123+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I spectated a silver reksai main game once.

I think she is only useless to baddies lmfao\n\nAt the same time tunnels have a pretty high CD and are necessary for rek'sai to gank/get around the map/disengage. Its tricky to micro manage your tunnels unless you mindlessly spam them. \n\nI'm one token away from level 7 on rek, and I can say its game specific, I either have tunnels all over my jungle for all my camps either because the game is slow and people are pushing, or I have almost no tunnels in my jungle cause I'm camping lanes or counter jungling and need them to escape/engage. \n\nIn my last game I had about a consistent 3 tunnels up, 2 in my red side jg, usually none by blue buff since I camped mid/bot and saved tunnels knowing an engage mid or bot were priorities, and one in my base near fountain for whatever reason (I like to say its just a free escape TP insurrance, but in reality its just to leave base quicker). With that lack of tunnel control, I managed to get an S+ with an afk (4v5) on my side. \n\nI wouldn't say its just bad rek'sai mains claiming she's weak (don't even main her) but people that play with rek'sais, and her general performance as a soloq champion in low/mid elo is pretty weak.. you can't even compare her to champs like nidalee or azir in performance as rek'sai isn't even mechanically difficult, just undertuned in about everything besides tank stat in soloq. Wouldn't mind a knock up/slow increase or a fury gain buff to make up for all the \"vision/tunnel/map pressure\" they're taking away.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2016-08-15T23:54:50.553+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"I was saying this would happen before he got all the nerfs and people wouldn't listen.
