Anyway, I had 3 skins on the side that I did not want so I decided to fuse it for a permanent skin. I was on Queue while this was all happening. So while it was doing its animation thingy the game found a match. I could see the check mark from the skin. (couldn't see what it was because I found a match) I thought that I didn't need to click the check mark so i went ahead and accepted the match and check what skin I got after the game. But after the game the skin was nowhere to be found. Then i realized that i probably needed to click that check mark.. errr... Can someone give me a conformation on this and is there a way where I can get it back or is it lost in space? Anyway thanks lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-25T03:47:25.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries bud! I went in and checked your hextech crafting history and it looks like those three skin shards were turned into Angler Jax and was redeemed automatically. Double check your collection for him and let me know if you see it ^_^!","replies":[{"poster":"Kansascarlo","date":"2017-07-26T04:49:14.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woah you right! :DD Thanks!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deathcap","date":"2017-07-25T14:11:16.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe his skin didnt disapear. but I seriously DO NOT have my snow day singed. i bought him like a year ago. and i cant play him. its locked and says not available at this time.

It is a random skin. Browse through your champions and see if you have anything new.\n\nYou only get a Permanent Skin or Champion token if you already own them all and try to roll 3 shards for a permanent one.\n\nOn another note, I wish I could gift my Soulstealer Vayne skin shard to someone, seeing as I already own her, and feel like it would be a waste to convert it to anything else.","replies":[]}]}
