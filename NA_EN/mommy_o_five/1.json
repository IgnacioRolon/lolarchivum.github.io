I knew people signed a petition and i was one of them and i was curious if i would get banned for using custom skins. I used to use them season 6 and i'm too worried about if i will get banned since season 7  came out, which is upsetting because i really enjoyed custom skins.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-14T18:46:54.984+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"In general, we don't support the use of any third party programs so using them is at your own risk.  We're not specifically banning for custom skins right now but that can change in the future.  We also can't offer you any support if you run into technical iussues or your program ends up having malicious content hiding inside it.  Check out our [third party guide](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/5kx4F7VE-reminder-third-party-applications), and best practice would be to stay safe and away from mods.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
