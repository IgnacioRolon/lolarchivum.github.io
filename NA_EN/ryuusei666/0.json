I did find http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4196488 this but i am not sure if this is an official thread and/or are the official pages of these people? Awesome none-the-less but yeah. I was wondering where someone might find the information about the artists pages. Facebook, DeviantArt, Flickr, Wysp, Blogspot, Livejournal, Instagram, whatever they might be using! I always love to see WIPs, sketches, different art, updates and so on from artists. I&#039;m learning for Game Artist myself as well, already graduated in Graphic Desgin/Art&amp;Design. I just like to research different styles, see peoples progress... i&#039;m just being very very curious and i am sure that there are more people out there who would love to see more art!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance! I hope i get an answer.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2015-08-12T19:10:52.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Ryuusei666,\n\nMany artists have personal websites, DeviantArt etc. where they post their own work but are also permitted to post LoL artwork that is player-facing.\n\nA quick search found this big list of Artists and their sites: https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2j7e14/list_of_riot_games_artists_with_links/\n\nYou probably couldn't find anything by Xypherous because he isn't an artist, he's a Technical Designer.\n\nLet me know if you have any specific questions >:)","replies":[]}]}
