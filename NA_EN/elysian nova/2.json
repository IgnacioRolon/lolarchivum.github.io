This can happen at anytime during the selection screen. When i choose to look at another application such as Firefox, the game literally freezes until you finally disconnect because you couldn&#039;t choose your champion or ban a champion. All i see is the counter going down to zero for the person who is going to pick and stay at zero. Then when it comes to me to pick in everyone&#039;s screen i cant because it is frozen for me. It&#039;s been happening a few times already and it is getting annoying at this point. It happened just recently in a ranked selection screen today as well. It doesn&#039;t happen all the time every single match but it happens randomly within either match i start. Ill try and see if i can record a video with it happening.","replies":[{"poster":"AlyxiaFox","date":"2016-04-22T17:19:39.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First and foremost before we try to get too technical try running it as administrator. \n\nfor more detailed help join my discord server to make this a bit easier. https://discord.gg/0xqvayCpUczwnvn3 if anyone else needs help with anything technical related feel free to join as well.\n\nIll post here back with a fix for Show Me Ya Moves' issue.","replies":[]}]}
