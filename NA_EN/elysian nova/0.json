But I have noticed that when you summon a soldier and attack immediately, the soldier  strikes the target and would sometimes not apply the damage. All you would see is nothing. No number saying how much damage that soldier produced. So i am not sure if that's a bug or if its meant to be like that. {{champion:268}}","replies":[{"poster":"Elysian Nova","date":"2014-10-20T20:14:21.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so i played a game with azir today in ranked and what happened was i was carrying the team. late game i started to notice you can stack your turret on top of your living turret? WTF? lol. i could not take a screen shot since it was ranked and i had to carry and i did not know how to in game unless maybe windowed. but had no time. yet another bug. it was the first time i have ever seen this with Azir though so i'm guessing this happens rarely {{champion:268}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yago","date":"2014-10-20T19:34:16.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play Azir regularly and have still noticed significant bugs. I know it's probably related to CC stacking bugs that have existed since the dawn of League, but his Emperor's Divide sometimes lets people cast spells during it still. I died to a Darius grab the other day that was cast DURING the knockback and pulled me approximately twice the range it normally does.\n\nThe soldiers attacking instantly bug has also cost me some last hits in lane or pushed the lane unintentionally.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sleepymike","date":"2014-10-20T17:16:29.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here, If you get enough speed going with {{champion:268}} , his soldiers attack out of sync or fail to do damage. Attacking immediately with the soldiers when you get in range sometimes fails to do damage. Either that or the animation applies no damage.\nThere should be a master post with all Azir related issues. His E, W, Q, and R are still bugged.\nTo my surprise Riot has made no announcements about it yet.\nI found all issues and later will take some screenshots.","replies":[]}]}
