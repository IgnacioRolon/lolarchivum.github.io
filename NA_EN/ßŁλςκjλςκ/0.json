(imagine it like the first strike in Rengar&#039;s Q but with a bit longer range and without the dash)\n**Third cast:**  Yasuo consumes all stacks to unleash a whirlwind that travels an increased distance in the target direction, dealing the same damage and knocking Airborne icon airborne all enemies hit. Steel Tempest&#039;s Airborne icon knockup does not gain increased range when cast during Sweeping Blade.\n\n**W: Wind Shield**\n--- Cooldown _18/16/14/12/10 sec_\nUpon casting yasuo disables all CC affecting him and creates a wind shield around him that lasts for _1/1.25/1.50/1.75/2 seconds_  which blocks the first attack from an enemy champion (Basic attack, ability, even summoner spell). If an attack was blocked yasuo gains a shield that absorbs  _120/160/200/250/300(+30% AD)_ damage for _2/2.25/2.50/2.75/3 seconds_.\n\n** E: Sweeping Blade**\n--- Stays the same.\n\n**R: Last Breath**\n---Range: 1200\n---Cooldown: 80 / 55 / 30\n--- Damage: _200 / 300 / 400 (+ 150% bonus AD)_\nYasuo blinks to the visible airborne enemy champion nearest the cursor.\nUpon arrival, he generates a shield that absorbs _200/300/400(+50% AD)_ damage for 1.5 seconds and suspends all nearby airborne enemies for 1 second, dealing physical damage. For the next 15 seconds, Yasuo&#039;s Critical strike  critical strikes gain 50% bonus armor penetration.\n\n&gt; **Notes**\n\nI separated his current passive shield in two different abilities which individually give less shield, but more when combined.\nI removed windwall since that is the ability most people have problems with but added a cleanse effect.\nHis basic attacks deal less critical damage than before but his Q does more.\nDo you remember when people started building tank Yasuo and still did tons of damage, but in that case they were impossible to kill?  Keeping his double critical chance makes sure that Yasuo players will have at least 2 non-defensive items so we would not see any full tank Yasuo that oneshots the adc or the mid laner.\n\n> Edit:\n\n--- Increased Q base damage by 20% and increased his critical damage from 70% to 80% + now does apply on-hit effects.\n--- W no longer apply CC immunity, but it gives more shield for an increased duration.\n--- W blocks the first attack from an enemy champion.\n\nPlease let me know if u think this would be a better or worse version of Yasuo. And tell me if you would change something else. Yasuo is one of my favorite champions so i would like to know what other people would consider changing about him.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2017-08-03T23:44:08.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Out of the many issues I see with this particular rework, my biggest is the crit debuff. Why would you knock off even more damage? You took away a full 25% of his dps. What in the world is the compensation here? A bit more AOE on his Q? I certainly hope that wasn't supposed to be enough. You can't just cut that much damage out of a champion's kit and expect it to keep working.\n\nYou also removed loads of survivability from the kit by outright removing his windwall and knocking more than half the value off his shield. Oh, and he takes increased damage from his W too. Super.\n\nEDIT: Oh, and I forgot that his Q not only doesn't longer dealing oh-hit effects, but its damage is also strictly worse at all stages until you've got enough AD to hit the AA/Q break even point on live.

But many people see that he can get 100% crit with 2 items a bad thing, specially in low elo, so i did that trying to make him more fair to play against.  I think the Cleanse on W and the shield, which is now increased, are enough to help him survive a gank for example and u can buy a QSS to get even higher chances of survival. Yes i split his shield on 2 parts, but tell me what is better... a shield that goes off on it's own when being hit, or a shield that can be timed whenever u need it the most. Plus when combined with the ultimate i believe it gives you more shield. \nI increased the crit and base damage on Q and added back the on-hit effects. But i did not add back the crit damage on his basic attacks.\nIf u have any ideas how to make this \"rework\" better feel free to write it down. Maybe RIOT will see this post and will get some good ideas from you and other players.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2017-08-05T09:13:43.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First, let me commend you for for very nearly equalizing your kit's approximate DPS with Yasuo's current DPS. Very nice. And now did that's out of the way, did you know Yasuo has one of the highest deaths per game out of all the champions in League? I, for one, didn't think he needed to be easier to kill.\n\nAn on-demand shield *is* better than the alternative, but here's the thing, you still took almost half his shield. During any given engagement, Yasuo can get two uses out of his shield for a maximum value of 1020. If your Yasuo stacks both shields, he gets a total of 450+40%AD, which will only rarely be higher than 570 points, and still I'm not convinced that a cleanse is worth up to 450 points of damage mitigation **and the loss of his single most powerful ability**.\n\nI should have jumped on this earlier, but Windwall's sheer utility is a substantial enough portion of Yasuo's power budget that it's almost the sole reason why Yasuo gets outdueled by most other melee carries. Take that away and you're left with not only the weakest skirmisher in the game, but probably the lowest winrate champion too.","replies":[{"poster":"ßŁλςκJλςκ","date":"2017-08-05T13:53:25.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IronwallJackson,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=0ccum108,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2017-08-05T09:13:43.828+0000)\n>\n> First, let me commend you for for very nearly equalizing your kit&#x27;s approximate DPS with Yasuo&#x27;s current DPS.

I thought adding back the CC immunity was a bit too much, but now it completely blocks an attack, like fiora's W but without reversing the CC or doing any damage to the enemy. and i increased the shield even more both on W and ult.\n\nUpon casting yasuo disables all CC affecting him and creates a wind shield around him that lasts for _1/1.25/1.50/1.75/2 seconds_  which blocks the first attack from an enemy champion (Basic attack, ability, even summoner spell). If an attack was blocked yasuo gains a shield that absorbs  _120/160/200/250/300(+30% AD)_ damage for _2/2.25/2.50/2.75/3 seconds_.\n","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2017-08-05T15:19:49.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm starting to get this feeling like this is the sort of kit that balances on a knife's edge, and this ability is going to be a point of contention. It's very powerful, but not so much that it outclasses Windwall, so you're probably alright. Although, I'm now concerned that it's difficult to grok how much power went into his W, thereby balancing the rest of his kit in its absence into a real challenge.\n\nThis is why Riot playtests extensively.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2017-08-02T22:40:25.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly, the W seems way too strong.\n\nIt has half the cd of his old W, is now also useful vs melee champs, AND cleanses cc with a non-interactive self shield?

I wanted to give him the chance to be able to escape if something goes wrong without having to deny the damage he gets since that is the biggest problem he has right now with wind wall, he blocks all range damage and it can be frustrating.
