What does Irelia actually lack?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"She has burst damage, sustained damage, physical/magical/true damage, sustain on Q and conquerer when proc'ed, ranged hard CC that can stun multiple targets, a  90% slow, conditional hyper mobility, an uninterruptable 50% physical damage reduction channel, her passive is literally a fucking Wits End built in when fully stacked just without the healing aspect. She has a great early game, mid game, and late game. Snowballs extremely fucking hard. She has nearly the same level \"Yasuo effect\" of if you bury her early, you better end it because she'll eventually get farm and items. Waveclear \"issues\" are solved in usually her first purchase of Tiamat. Her Level 2 cheese is one of the deadliest in the game. You're her bitch praying to the gods you dodge her E while she's stacking her passive because if she does stun you, you're likely dead. Especially with Ignite. You literally have to play champions like Darius, Renekton, Pantheon, Kennen, and Jayce who can bully her off the wave so she can't stack her passive. Oh, but she outscales literally all of them.","replies":[{"poster":"Ilezt","date":"2019-06-12T06:37:40.982+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They give every champion , everything now days or atleast  overload their kit too much- look at Sylas  CC , Sustain , Healing , Burst Damage and and Low CDs(after Mid-Game) along with Shields not to forget Mobility and Every Ult in the Game .

I'd rather they strengthen certain aspects of her significantly and completely remove some of the access, to give her clear strengths and weaknesses, rather than give her this hodgepodge medley of overcooked BS. They say she's weak, but anyone with decent on her completely steamrolls almost any opponent with ease, even against players of equal skill and even against counters.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2019-06-12T12:24:04.319+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"% reduction against magic damage","replies":[{"poster":"ImTheJuggernauty","date":"2019-06-12T17:05:21.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The funny thing about that, is when they removed it, they upped her physical damage reduction, her base hp, and her % hp, so she is much tankier against physical damage threats, and almost as tanky vs AP due to her increased hp. It's actually stupid because she now gains more hp/lvl than actual juggernauts like darius. Unless I'm mistaken, it's 110/lvl, and darius is 100/lvl","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2019-06-12T12:34:53.780+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Irelia lacks balance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Luther King Jr V","date":"2019-06-12T13:08:59.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"she lacks me to her side","replies":[]},{"poster":"PhearBunny","date":"2019-06-12T12:14:12.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"irelia doesnt lack anything.\nShe is a modernized champion, and mechanically is one of the standards of modern balance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Woodakoodashooda","date":"2019-06-12T03:00:13.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She can't jungle and she isn't AP oriented.\n\nThat's alI can think of...","replies":[{"poster":"Galaxyburstz","date":"2019-06-12T03:02:25.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FizupQPROZ0\n\n: /","replies":[{"poster":"I memba balance ","date":"2019-06-12T03:08:21.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"xxxliltrash ","date":"2019-06-12T06:52:03.238+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ireland clearly lacks nerfs, letâ€™s nerf her again","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrazyMonkeyCZ","date":"2019-06-12T04:59:23.697+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Family?","replies":[]}]}
