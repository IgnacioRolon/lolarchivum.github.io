Pepperidge Farm remembers. Nothing like getting one shot (and actually overkilled) by a Teleport/Fleet Footwork Akali who only has Hextech Revolver. Or getting one shot by a Qiyana who ignites you one auto attack from death because even she doesn't reallize how absolutely bonkers broken her burst is EVEN WITHOUT HER ULTIMATE. Remember when building full AP Malphite used to be just a trolly/fun thing to do in ARAM and a few niche players could do it in high elo midlane? Now it's viable and more effective to do that than go tank because MR items are shit and AP itemization is broken as hell but mage abusers will insist they have no diversity and their itemization is crap. Remember the last time Kai'sa wasn't a top tier ADC with a bunch of built in safety nets and two very viable build paths of going AP/on-hit or AD with Muramana and Rageblade? Oh, that was just when she wasn't actually in the game yet because she's been broken tier ever since release. Remember when you had to sacrifice damage for CDR as a mage, bruiser or assassin? Now you build core items and overcap just fucking because and are given a rune that now encourages that. When I first started you were taught to NOT overcap CDR because it was horribly gold inefficient. Now you have CDR built into every damn item. I don't even know why people beg for URF mode. Literally just play normal/ranked Summoner's Rift and you're getting close to the same experience anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2019-11-01T03:10:04.061+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Remember when Eve could kill from invis with stacked sunfires?\nRemember when Xin was an instant win?\nRemember Kass could stack R in fountain then 1 shot in an aoe with teleport?\nRemember when Ram could use Tele homegaurd for 1000 Ms ganks?\nRemember when Sion instant won all matcheups mid with point and click stun and sustained everything with his R that the shield did not block?\nWhen leblanc had silence and bullyed everything?\nWhen annie could stack 2 stuns?\nWhen TF had an Aoe stun and a global TP on 30 second cd?\nWhen Veigar legitmatly 1 shot with a single R cast?\nWhen Trist legitamtly could 1 shot with a single R cast?\nWhen Ashe and Siv where mids and bot was sup/mage?\nWhen a complicated combo was you had to press 3 keys because your champion had a passive then point and click everything?","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-11-01T03:03:56.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was never like that, really.
