I didn't realize until this morning what is going on.\r\n\r\nYesterday I submitted several apple support tickets because I'd had 3 mouses die on me in 3 days. One was a mouse I'd been playing with for a while, the following two were cheap mouses. I connect these mouses to my macbook pro, and three died on me in three days. It was only today, using a fourth mouse I found in my house, that I realize what is going on: **When I load into a league game, my mouse dies. And it doesn't just stop responding to this computer. It _dies._ ** It won't work on other computers either. This is a pretty terrible thing, for obvious reasons. Does anyone have ANY idea what this might be about? I'm 100% sure what's going on--this has now happened to 4 mouses in a row.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-20T21:44:12.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't really think of anyway loading a game like League could completely kill a mouse, that'd be pretty extreme for sure O_O!\n\nDo me a favor and maybe try a different usb (if it's usb connected anyways) and also try doing a quick config reset to make sure your keybinds are still working properly too.\n\n- Launch League and Login\n- Right click on your League of Legend Icon and select \"Show package contents\"\n- Navigate to Riot Games\\League of Legends\n- Delete the Config folder\n- Start a Custom Game to verify changes (everything should be reset to default).","replies":[]}]}
