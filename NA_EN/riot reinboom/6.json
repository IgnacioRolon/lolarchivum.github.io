Riot Reinboom here to bring you a look into the thoughts behind the Marksman itemization changes this preseason. :D\n\nTo jump straight to the point, Marksmen have a number of pain points in the game right now. There&rsquo;s a distinct lack of individuality between Marksmen. For most, their items are incredibly prescriptive and there&rsquo;s not a lot of deviation. Generally, as a class, they suffer from high team demands without a lot of self expression to work within those demands.\n\nThe major thread woven between most of these issues is a distinct lack of meaningful choice.\n\n* **Meaningful Choice**\n\n[We&rsquo;ve mentioned Meaningful Choice before](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/lol-design-values-depth-meaningful-choices).\n\nWhat&rsquo;s most important here however is the method to achieving meaningful choice (rather than just choice). For Marksman items, we tackled this with three different strategies: &ldquo;Autonomy&rdquo;, &ldquo;Reaction&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Prediction&rdquo;.\n\n**Autonomy.** Autonomy as a choice is represented by the tradeoff of multiple fantasies (whether they be gameplay fantasies, thematics, or anything you can form a personal attachment to). Feeling attached to Statikk Shiv because you personally value wave clear and are willing to sacrifice your other options for it, is an aspect of autonomy shown in item form.\n\n**Reaction.** Reaction as a choice is represented by your capability to solve a problem presented to you. There are multiple types of reaction. For these changes, we&rsquo;ll be focusing on responses to your opponents in the items they build, the champions they pick, and the needs of your team.\n\n**Planning.** Planning as a choice is represented by the tactical and strategic goals you create for individual games. This can be seen by decisions on how you or your team should address each fight (and then building to work within that understanding), or the order for which you build your components, such as getting a Pick Axe to prep for your Last Whisper as you wait for your opponent to inevitably build armor.\n\n* **Supporting Variety**\n\nWhen it comes to supporting more options for Marksman, we often run into a difficult problem we call &ldquo;The Marksman Damage Optimization Problem.&rdquo; Marksmans item choices have classically been guided by a very simple and direct point of output: &ldquo;How can I do the most damage with the options presented to me?&rdquo;\n\nWe&rsquo;re operating under the assumption that this problem is fundamental to Marksman and their role within League. There are a number of reasons for this.\n\nIn games (not just League) single points of optimization, when that point can empower itself, tend to be notably strong. In Marksman&rsquo;s case, their single point of optimization is damage. This is primarily caused by their damage being reliable via ranged auto-attacks, meaning they can leverage positioning (which is free) as a primary defense.\n\nHowever, we feel like this identity is clear for Marksman. This type of distinct identity allows League to work as a team game, where each individual has their contribution. So in order to support keeping what makes a Marksman a Marksman while still offering choice, we&rsquo;ll be exploring a different route: While picking up the stats that give Marksman their damage, we should offer choices among those items along the way.\n\nYou can see this already in the game with the choice posed by Phantom Dancer and Statikk Shiv. Unfortunately, the nuance of this choice can be hard to appreciate (am I behind, or could be behind in gold?), and even then there&rsquo;s not a lot of these types of selections.\n\n* **The Changing Landscape**\n\nTo wrap it altogether, choices that end up just being damage optimization tests aren&rsquo;t great. But that&rsquo;s the expectation of a Marksman. And they have core needs on top of core needs built out of natural consumption of &ldquo;a lot of different stats.&rdquo;\n\nThe direction we went with to introduce meaningful choice to these restrictions is the idea of &ldquo;horizontal expansion.&rdquo; Take the model presented by the current system, and diversify within those bounds. Your options for lifesteal need to be greater than a single item. The items that define a Marksman&rsquo;s play pattern should expand beyond just &ldquo;awesome auto attacks.&rdquo; Your options available for who you can target should be greater than &ldquo;always buy Last Whisper.&rdquo;\n\n---\n**Identity**\nWho am I? Do I autoattack quite a bit? Okay, Infinity Edge. Maybe I autoattack a lot? Infinity Edge. No, seriously, autoattacks are my jam and I will hear nothing less. Fine, Blade of the Ruined King.\n\nNot a lot there.\n\nThere&rsquo;s a few valid ways of addressing this: we could push more differences between the auto attacks ( [see the roster devblog](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/1YZMAzz0-dev-blog-marksman-update-in-the-2016-season) \\), or we could push some Marksman to be empowered by their abilities.\n\nIdentity items highlight and specialize the choices you made at champion select. Once again, &ldquo;Who am I?&rdquo; We don&rsquo;t feel like in the current landscape the more caster-like Marksman are well served by this idea. Enter: **Essence Reaver.**\n\nEssence Reaver is being changed to offer caster marksman access to a stat they&rsquo;ve desired, but could never really (or rarely) fully utilize: Cooldown Reduction.\n\nEssence Reaver now has the capability to generate you up to 30% Cooldown Reduction by leveraging the Critical Strike Chance available from other Marksman items. We you to feel comfortable making the same damage offers, choices, and expectations from the rest of the Marksman items while being able to uniquely leverage what your champion pick offered.\n\n---\n**Multiplier**\n\nStatikk Shiv or Phantom Dancer. Am I behind or am I ahead?\n\nThere&rsquo;s a lot of possible room with these items, except that Phantom Dancer is the poster child for TMDOP (&ldquo;The Marksman Damage Optimization Problem,&rdquo; remember?).\n\nSo we&rsquo;re changing that. And we&rsquo;re widening what it means to be a multiplier item.\n\nIn addition to be the damage curve definers, the pointed tip at the end of your two item spike, multipliers are getting an additional identity: &ldquo;How should I fight?&rdquo; This is a choice grounded primarily within autonomy (&ldquo;What works best for me?&rdquo;) as well as reaction (&ldquo;What works best for my team?&rdquo;).\n\nWe divided this choice into four large branches:\n**Phantom Dancer:** I should skirmish and duel.\n**Hurricane:** I want to team fight and wombo.\n**Statikk Shiv:** I must push.\n**Rapid Firecannon:** I need to siege.\n\n---\n\n**Situational Offense**\n\nLast Whisper highlights an interesting problem. The usage of total penetration meant that even against champions not buying armor, Last Whisper was actually at least a +10% physical damage amp. This was actually a &ldquo;generally useful&rdquo; item masquerading under the guise of a tank killer.\n\nWe want to break the above expectations to make selective offense a little less automatic while, at the same time, making it easier to pick up a response when it&rsquo;s necessary. Selective offensive items are now guided by their components and what you&rsquo;re giving up, while being significantly more targeted than the current Last Whisper.\n\nThe components:\n**Last Whisper:** I need to get through their bonus armor.\n**Executioner&rsquo;s Calling:** I need to stuff their life steal or health gain.\n**Giant Slayer:** I need to climb over their mountain of health.\n\nThese items can be combined up, with a final selection of which type of selection are you leaving out:\n**Lord Dominik&rsquo;s Regards:** A combination of Last Whisper and Giant Slayer\n**Mortal Reminder: **A combination of Last Whisper and Executioner&rsquo;s Calling\n\nDo note the change from *total* to **bonus armor** penetration, as all of these are still armor pen items at heart. It bears repeating: *we do not want these items to be generalist damage purchases.* This is also why we split the use case of Mortal Reminder (taking out high sustain targets like enemy marksmen, Swain, Mundo, etc) and Lord Dominik&rsquo;s Regards (tank busting). If you find you don&rsquo;t need the situational offense these items bring (or nobody&rsquo;s building any armor!), maybe you can look into picking up another multiplier, or some...\n\n---\n**Situational Defense**\n\nThe key defense favored by Marksman is lifesteal, but there&rsquo;s not a lot available here so all Marksman default to the same purchase: The Bloodthirster. This stat is so core that it actively pushes aside all other defensive choices until it&rsquo;s covered.\n\nWe&rsquo;re running with that idea. For Marksman, lifesteal means defense. The result is all the items in this category provide *enough* lifesteal before letting you branch into the types of defenses you should otherwise situationally take.\n\n**The Bloodthirster:** I need to sustain through everything\n**Death&rsquo;s Dance:** I need to get burst off me long enough to hit\n**Mercurial Scimitar:** I need to be free (of CC)\n\n---\n\n* **Going Forward**\nThere&rsquo;s a lot of new abilities and interactions presented by the changed items, and we don&rsquo;t believe we have every one of these ironed out.\n\nLeague of Legends hasn&rsquo;t been tuned to the idea that some Marksman will get 40% Cooldown Reduction, for example, and it&rsquo;s impossible to know the full effects of this.\n\nWe&rsquo;ll be watching diligently to identify what&rsquo;s problematic and what&rsquo;s not!","replies":[{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2015-11-04T20:39:41.137+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why do adcs only need to dedicate a single item slot to killing tanks?\n\nRight now, adcs can go three standard damage items to murder squishies, one tank-busting item in the form of giantslayer, boots and a defensive item. Why are they allowed to nearly burst squishies like assassins, and melt tanks like no other in lategame? Shouldn't they have to decide who they are good at damaging?\n\nOr am I overestimating the damage three offensive items will deal to a squishy champion? Or the effectiveness of Giant slayer? (historically, tanks have never been allowed to really be tanky towards adcs for long.) Or is Riot ok with adcs having such a lategame fantasy that it nullifies any tanks' lategame fantasy?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Reinboom","date":"2015-11-04T21:48:29.478+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Marksman are the damage class that's in charge with killing tanks (eventually).\nWe don't want that to be increased (or increased to a notable degree) above what's on live however.\n\nOne of the more difficult balancing points for a carry class is these expectations. If, as a class, we need Marksman to deal less damage to squishier targets, that's difficult to do because it will break their expectations on needing to kill tankier targets. If we need Marksman to deal more damage to tankier targets, that's difficult to do because that will make them delete squishier targets.\n\nLord Dominik's Regards compared to old Last Whisper is this redirected in a vacuum. Moving from **total** penetration to **bonus** penetration is actually a rather significant nerf in damage against **all** targets, squishy and tanky. Everyone has base armor and there's a lot of it. Depending on who the target is, just that conversion is a loss from anywhere around 10% to upwards of around 20% damage.\n\nGiant Slayer is doing two things in that Regards.\n1: It's covering up the damage nerf on the item to some of the classes. If it's still too high, it can be individually adjusted without much pain either.\n2: It retains and confirms Marksman's weakness of not favoring health (so things like Trinity Force and The Black Cleaver are less favorable if you're also getting this)\n\n(note: The damage it gives is based on the difference between the Marksman's health and its target, so it gets weaker the more health the Marksman has)","replies":[{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2015-11-04T22:57:49.118+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering that:\n \nGiant Slayer has 1% per 50 HP more, up to 10%.

So, if there is a problem with ADCs being able to damage \"squishy\" mages too easily, how would you go about changing that? Maybe decreasing LDR's percentage to 1% per 50 HP, but still capping out at 15%?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Reinboom","date":"2015-11-04T23:10:46.617+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Along those lines.

Marksmen optimize for damage so directly which means creating a desirable enough defensive item is difficult without pushing on this risk.\n\nWe've intentionally starved the high end damage points because of this. Infinity Edge and Phantom Dancer had a ways it could go while still being \"high end damage items\". Their damage is going down specifically to make room for more interesting abilities.\n\nI don't believe we've hit the balance needed for this perfectly yet. It's difficult to get a degree of imbalance with this many changes (and there will likely be something that slips out obscene, oh preseason). But it *can* be adjusted once out.\n\nMore importantly, there are actually a notable number of more tools that let us reach those adjustments now. e.g. If a tank becomes unseen due to these changes, raising their base armor per level is much more meaningful now.","replies":[{"poster":"Escanor v2","date":"2015-11-04T20:10:38.303+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem i see is that with more lifesteal items and passive from Phantom Dancer( not sure if this is the right item) which says that 12% of damage is dealt as bleed, ADC will be able to out lifesteal this bleed effect and that will mean that Phantom Dancer, with enough lifesteal, will give pure 12% damage reduction to ADC's and that is a lot.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MudintheWater","date":"2015-11-04T19:31:53.627+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"In regards to the new ER I just find it strange that mages who aren't viable without 40% CDR are going to lose 5% cdr from masteries (because realistically they will all go 18/12) and only get 20% cdr from individual items while marksmen can get 30% from one now. \n\nMages:\nSeason 5: scaling CDR glyphs + masteries plus one 20% cdr item = 40% cdr. \nSeason 6: scaling CDR glyphs plus one cdr item = 35% cdr.

The addition of flat armor penetration coupled with a pair of unique passives that reward you for taking risks helps Talon or Wukong a lot more than it helps any Marksman.\n\nI do think there will be some Marksman usage of this item and that's perfectly acceptable, but they aren't intended core users and I don't think they actually like this iteration better than the previous one, except that the previous one was weak.\n\n------------------\n\n{{item:3071}} is being changed with Juggernaut build diversity in mind. I realize that's going to look strange since they'd prefer the previous iteration of the item - because it gave them everything they might want in a single package. On Live, if you're a core Black Cleaver user, you're going to rush it pretty much no matter what - it isn't contextual at all. With the changes, if you really need defenses first, you won't be able to rely on that item to solve it for you - but if you're doing well and want more kill power so you can snowball, it's even better.\n\nI do anticipate more use by non-Juggernauts - it's a better item for {{champion:62}}, for example, and that's fine. I will be very surprised if Marksmen adopt it - maybe one ({{champion:104}}?), but certainly not on any widespread basis. There's no reason to build it with {{item:3508}} and Essence Reaver is simply better for those champions.\n\nThis is the riskiest change of the three, and if it does break The Black Cleaver for Juggernauts, we will certainly be following up.\n\n-----------------\n\n{{item:3078}} was actually changed in 3 different ways for different reasons:\n\n(1) Power reduced across the board - it was one of the highest outliers for gold efficiency in the entire game, so our efficiency normalization pass hit it especially hard.

When I bought Iceborn on a tank it was because I wanted a tanky damage item, and since so many Tanks have AP ratios on their skills it provided a nice one two damage punch of increasing their AAs and their skill damage. In addition it now gives 20% CDR, but CDR is such an easy stat to get for a tank that I fear that the extra 10% CDR is going to end up being wasted after the midgame since you will be over the cap naturally because of the items you want to buy.\n\nAs for Trinity Force, it is kind of a mess right now. It doesn't really look like a fighter item, because the stats that they bought it for are the ones that went down. While the increase in crit damage is meh. When I build it on fighters, bruisers, or juggernauts, currently, crit is probably the least desirable stat. I don't plan on buying more crit and I don't plan on relying on crit. My suggestion is to replace Zeal with a new component that gives less crit, but more AS and MS and tweak the Trinity Force numbers around that to make it more inline with how it is currently than trying to pigeon whole in a new stat distribution because of the marksman rework.","replies":[{"poster":"Carnicore","date":"2015-11-05T02:19:11.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cooldown reduction is a much better stat for tanks than AP is.

By having them share so much of their build path, we allow you to choose which one you really need later, which means more adaptation to the game state. For this particular set of items, we value that pretty highly.\n\n> Why are the item recipes for Shiv and Firecannon identical? Couldn't Firecannon build out of something different than Zeal (Cloak + Dagger, anything)?\n\nThis reinforces the shared properties of those two items. It's not ideal, but I wouldn't consider it a big problem either.\n\n> Why does Executioner's Calling proc without any prerequisition like the one Morellonomicon has?\n\nWe think this model is correct for Executioner's Calling, particularly given the changes to Grievous Wounds (e.g. it no longer applies to healing from allies, so {{champion:16}}'s W isn't reduced). It's possible that we need to re-evaluate Morellonomicon, though I'm much less sure about that one.\n\n> Why is BT's combine cost so atrociously high (1500g)?\n\nI'm gonna fix this one.\n\n> Do you really think BT will be able to compete with Mercurial Scimitar, which has a better build path, costs the same, provides the same AD and has the invaluable QSS active?\n\nYes, I do. You're glossing over the value of 10% lifesteal and effectively 300+ health later in the game - that's a huge amount of power. That said, I do think we're going to see a lot of double lifesteal builds, so I suspect it's more a question of \"Pick 2 of Death's Dance, Mercurial Scimitar, Bloodthirster, Blade of the Ruined King, or Maw of Malmortius\" rather than a direct comparison between these two items, and I think Bloodthirster fits in as one of those 2 in many situations.\n\n> Why do both of the LW upgrades provide the same stats? Couldn't one of them have some AS or crit, to make the decision more than one-dimensional?\n\nWhen we do that, it's because we want to force a spotlight onto the one real point of difference - do you want to deal with tanky champs better or do you need grievous wounds? Stat differences tend to force you to optimize around your champion's stat usage - you get a situation where Jinx always buys X, Lucian always buys Y, which means that neither gets much of a choice and Jinx just ends up with the property \"Does more damage to health stackers\" and Lucian just ends up with the property \"Puts Grievous Wounds on targets\". There are situations where that's a good thing, but that's not what we're going for here.\n\n> Why did you guys hit Black Cleaver so hard, taking off 100 health and making it cost 500 g more?\n\nI answered this in more detail [elsewhere in the thread](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/m8EHNfVe-dev-blog-marksman-itemization?comment=00030000), but Tl;dr: shifting power from defense to offense is intended to help Juggernaut build diversity a little bit by making it an even better choice in some situations but a wrong choice in others.\n\nAs for its efficiency going down specifically, it was one of our outlier overly efficient items.","replies":[{"poster":"Pyro","date":"2015-11-04T22:55:25.365+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> We could, but adding more components carries its own costs and the value just isn't there. By having them share so much of their build path, we allow you to choose which one you really need later, which means more adaptation to the game state. For this particular set of items, we value that pretty highly.\n\nSo the TL;DR of this whole thing would be \"We see that the ideal ADC build is IE-PD-LW, so instead of giving a reason to change the stat distrubution on particular components, we'll just make two variants of IE, four variants of PD, and two variants of LW\".\n\nThere were multiple champions (Lucian, Vayne, Twitch) who used different builds, such as BotRK-Ghostblade, and will still continue to do so. Have you ever considered testing items with different stat distributions? Some champions would certainly consider an AD+Crit item smaller than IE/ER. Or an BF Sword item to rush with AS instead of crit.\n\nI'm still not convinced that \"forcing a spotlight onto the one real point of difference\" isn't simply making the choice between the items one-dimensional, while it could have been two-dimensional. The main point of difference between old Scimitar and Banshee is the item effect, with stats being a secondary attribute. BotRK and BT on Live compete in the lifesteal spot considering both their effects and stats (on most champions who would buy it as third item). I still think this kind of diversity could have been possible with the ADC multipliers.\n\n---\n\nI'd be glad if one of you guys took a look at the [megathread](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/legw6gGR-preseason-itemization-feedback-megathread-november-2nd-pbe-build) - there's some minor issues that shouldn't make it to Live, like Frozen Mallet and Sterak's Gage granting less AD than its components.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Irelia Bot","date":"2015-11-05T02:33:00.062+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you please Fix wit's end to have 42 on hit magic damage like it always has for the universal answer, the loss of 1337 is bad enough.\n\nHeck make the attack speed and MR 42 as well since they are both at 40.\n\nI still want it to only give the owner MR and not shred enemy MR in season 2 with a lower price so it is an ideal item to rush on more champs when facing AP but I know that is unlikely to happen at this point.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kurogaze","date":"2015-11-04T20:21:20.492+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This post is a repeat because, the thread in which I posted it was closed shortly after I posted.

Support heals are already being buffed, with the whole 15% damage reduction after giving out an heal, and now they do not have any \"proper\" counter-mechanic, not even ignite. Given you don't want opinions as questions, I'll just state that this, for me, is removing counterplay from the game.\n2. I am not sure, but I remember it was also stated that Grievous wounds being applied too freely was bad because it conflicted too much with the natural over-time regen, which was considered a base game mechanic to keep things balanced, again, if I remember correctly. Is that affected by the new grievous wounds? If it will, won't that be a issue? (Sorry if I remember it wrong...)\n3. I still would like to know how Riot is planning to balance the self-sustain based champ. (Vlad, Swain, Aatrox, Fiddlesticks. There are others, but none with self-healing as big as those.) Sure, the number of champions affected directly has greatly decreased with the GW change, but those that still are affected DO have a very different performance based only on a single item built by the enemy.\n4. The effectiveness of a lot of champions AGAINST the above class of champions risks to pivot too much on their ability to build an early GW item. You picked Rumble? (who can't really build either MR or Morello) tough luck beating that Vlad which is balanced around being able to survive with GW applied to him.
