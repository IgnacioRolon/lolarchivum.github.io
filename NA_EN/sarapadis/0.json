After we complete character select, the game crashes and opens up stating if I want to send the error. I will switch the main screen over to the other monitor and till work perfectly fine. I tried using the one monitor (only one plugged in) that had the error before, and it still doesn't want to work on this particular screen. I tried messing with the resolution (in game and monitor settings), but it still doesn't work and keeps popping up with the error.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone had the same issue while using duel monitors.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-22T03:57:08.828+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did someone say Duel monitor problem? ^.^\n\nhttps://hikkichan.com/misc/src/1459190376809.png\n\nOn a real note, this is likely caused by the resolution being different between those monitors, while League tries to load up the configuration for your secondary monitor.
