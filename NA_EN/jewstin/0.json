It could be a one day a year thing or just a onetime ever thing. Obviously, you would have to match skin values of the IP with the RP value, but i believe this idea could be a good one.","replies":[{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2015-07-14T20:50:16.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It'd basically kill Riot's revenue potential from some players...\n\nThey'd have to make the values so inflated that nobody but the people with millions of IP could even afford one skin or limit you to buying like one skin... because otherwise the people with all the IP would suddenly have every skin without paying a cent and would never have reason to spend money on Riot's game again.\n\nWhat they just need to do is add more IP based icnentives, more things to buy with IP.","replies":[{"poster":"Mundayy","date":"2015-07-14T21:13:02.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they could even limit everyone to buying just one skin with ip that would be cool to me.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lauki","date":"2015-07-14T21:06:03.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"chromes shoulda been for ip, rip","replies":[]},{"poster":"Radnar the bold","date":"2015-07-14T20:51:57.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then it would be very expense IP.......a 6300 champ costs/975 RP.............thus a 975 skin would be 6300.
