I've been all over the LoL interface and I can't find a single place to purchase them at. My main has had 20 pages for a long time but it's been a bit since I've had a new account and I can't find it anywhere! Can someone please answer this probably stupid question?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-05T20:11:44.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's an issue right now where it's hiding in the store page.  In the rune section of the store, open the drop down menu on the left side and change it from Show Tier 3 to Show All.  That will make the rune pages appear.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Vexxil","date":"2016-11-08T09:34:43.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh awesome! Thanks a lot!","replies":[]}]}]}
