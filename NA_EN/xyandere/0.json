Can't really explain this one.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, So basically I was playing with a friend called \"SoldierOfShurima\" who invited me to play a lol ranked game.  At first I thought it was a normal lag moment since the start due my net. But after a while I don't think so anymore. I was using shyvana in the jungle when it happened. I was basically fighting the jungle monsters for a whle but every 6-10 seconds, my ping would escalate past 4k. It wasn't my net or anything. I even alt tabbed to check on youtube, an online ping site and even opened up warframe, tera, and planetside 2 during the process. All three games worked just fine despite being HEAVIER than lol. The worst part of it all was that each time I activated my w the ping would even get worse. I tried attacking the mobs during that ping I could see the mobs dying, but my character wouldnt move like from the spot. It was awkward cause I even passed past diana, killed her and she didn't even see me or knew what the fuck has killed her till the ping went down on my side. Worst of it all was during the teamfights, sometimes the same shit would happen, but other times my character would just sit idly like a dumb puppet cut of it's strings. I could see my allies killing, fighting, my enemies poking and all and even kill me, but I wouldnt even move a single bit from that spot.\r\n\r\nI know it's a weird ass bug, and not a lag issue since I triple checked it more than twice and when I normally lag my character is normally sent back to base. But in this case that didnt happened. It just stayed there or kept moving without a body or name till I did w/e I was clicking to do. Can someone tell me what's going on here?{{item:3070}} {{champion:102}}  {{item:3070}}  Oh and yes, I did lose the game since at some point my shyv wouldnt move anymore. I was basically a melee turret by the end of the game xD","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-30T17:14:48.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It definitely sounds like you were experiencing some massive latency spikes and packet loss, as the symptoms line up with many other occurrences in the past I've seen. Most of the time, these issues are caused by issues along your route to the server, but sometimes local network configurations can influence these issues as well.\n\nAs a first step in resolving this, I strongly suggest ensuring your local network is up to snuff with our [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).

Apparently it had to do with the new windows 10. But that wasn't the only thing affecting it but also the router due the rain season over here at PR. The spikes were caused due one of the latest windows 10 {{champion:412}} updates apparently cause even till today it kept going non stop till I updated it to the new version that came out today.","replies":[]}]}]}
