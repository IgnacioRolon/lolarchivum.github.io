I was even playing earlier today just fine, but then I took a break to do some homework and laundry and when I came back and started a game it tells me \"Unable to connect.\" I can not even load into game at all now and I am getting in trouble with team mate because I can't play the damn game, but they do not know that an they report me and I get punished for this even though there is nothing I can do about it. I already played around with my connection as much as I could (since I am at college there are some things I can not do), tried restarting my computer, and even trying downloading the \"Hextech Repair Tool that I found on a post by RiotBrokenSword that is supposed to be a temporary fix and none of that worked at all. Please tell me something I can do, I do not like playing this game for over 6 years and then being severely punished because the game itself doesn't work properly. Please fix this or tell me there is something I can do.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-31T01:42:58.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like there might be a game file specific to Summoner's Rift that might have become corrupted somehow =\\ .
