I feel like I&#039;m just not getting the value out of it. I feel like if I just build as much damage as possible I&#039;d be better off. Note I&#039;ve only been playing for 4 days though since I took a year break. So can someone tell me how I should be playing with this item or is it situational? \r\n\r\nAlso, another question, the last Caitlyn game I had I was trying to carry my team but didn&#039;t feel like I had the damage to threaten the fed Darius enough. Their team had a lot of tanks too. I was also kinda the only damage on the team as every lane got shat on. \r\nhttps://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=vSekai what would be the ideal build for hypercarrying on ADC?","replies":[{"poster":"yoshi2790","date":"2017-04-07T21:07:58.642+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"ADC's buy {{item:3085}} because:\n\n1.

Some champions like it for this reason, since it helps them use on hit passives or abilities. some champions on-hit effects do not benefit from it though, such as Vayne's W, and Xayah's feathers.\n\nRunaan's is used often with on-hit items because it gives you more gold efficiency out of both it and the on-hit items. Hitting 3 targets and applying the effect is very good. Stuff like Black cleaver, Blade of the Ruined King, stattik shiv stacking, and wit's end all benefit from it and make the item stronger by synergy.\n\nBlade of the Ruined King plus armor pen is what it takes to deal with a fed juggernaut. Sometimes a frozen mallet can be helpful too. If you're struggling against multiple tanks then adding in a Runaan's allows you to apply the on hit effects of Blade of the ruined king to multiple targets.","replies":[]},{"poster":"yoshi2790","date":"2017-04-07T21:23:04.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ideal build for an ADC would be somewhat like this:\n\nStart : {{item:1055}} {{item:2003}} \nFirst back : {{item:1038}} {{item:1001}} \n2nd back:  {{item:3086}} If not bought yet  {{item:1001}} \nFirst item: {{item:3085}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3094}} {{item:3087}} Depending on what your champion wants\n2nd item: {{item:3031}} \n3rd Item:{{item:3006}} \n\nThen it depends, You could get another zeal item, or buy {{item:3072}} \nIf the enemy has a lot of armor you buy {{item:3035}} \nIf they have a lot of healing {{champion:8}} {{champion:106}}  {{champion:5}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:9}} etc... buy {{item:3123}} \nYou can buy {{item:3035}} or {{item:3123}} whenever it's necessary after your first 2 items.\n\nNormally you get 2 zeal items, 1 lifesteal item, infinity and last whisper.\nHowever if you need some defense you can buy {{item:3156}} {{item:3139}} {{item:3026}} instead of a second zeal item\nYou can buy {{item:3022}} too, for better kiting against champions like {{champion:75}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:106}} while getting more hp.

Even on Jhin and Graves contrary to popular belief. \n\nRunnan is currently the best \"zeal\" item in the game for nonmelee champs. It gives you waveclear and better teamfight capabilities.","replies":[]}]}
