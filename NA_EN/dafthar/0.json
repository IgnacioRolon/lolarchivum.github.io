Let's say I gotta be Mastery level 7 (when you realease lvls 6 &amp; 7) with Elise and at least platinum player to have a chance to have Victorious Elise as a reward. I suppose that's a contentious issue. Just wanted to bring the idea to the table.

It honestly wouldn't bother me for gold players from season 6 and beyond to have access to the skins I got for those seasons.

It's something we discuss, especially when new things like Hextech Crafting come about.

Just wanted to talk about it and propose a thing that is harder to get to (getting to gold is hands down easier than getting to plat/diamond and champion mastery level X, 7 for example) so it would be fair. Maining this particular champion would be the key, this is where champion mastery comes in.\n\nOfc victorious skins are the reward for each season, they say sth about their owners, that this guy was decent back then.

The thing is, I was a lil bit late, RIP. But when I know a lot more about the champion, play this champion more often etc., it still feels kinda unfair. I will respect any decision made by Riot.

We should search for that. Having either side of the issue being completely closed off to the possibility of a compromise not only stifles honest discussion about what could be done, but callously disregards the honest player pain felt by the other side.\n\nI mean, even Nintendo releases rare Pokemon like Mew only once in a blue moon (for NA), and they've only had like 2 or 3 Mew distributions in total so far... but they've given that chance to old AND new players. Even if there isn't another distribution for the next 5 years, at the very least people have had a FEW chances to get it over the course of Pokemon's life.\n\nI can't say how this would apply to Victorious Skins specifically, because those are in a little different situation than other limited skins... but for skins such as PAX I see a fairly similar situation.\n\nPoint being...

Plus I feel like the reward system is kind of slow... I rarely get chests and rarely get skin shards... and if i do it's normally some tacky cheap unpopular skin that's not worth anything in the store. I got a chest the other day from the once every 7 days and all i got was a Vayne skin shard... you don't know how much that tilted me... Especially when I get champion capsules from leveling up. And getting skins takes forever if you don't get orange essence or skins to disenchant to purchase them. I managed to get Elementalist Lux on my lowbie account i made for lunar revel and from the first of the two lunar orbs i got the skin shard from it. Too bad it costs like 3600 orange essence and i rarely get skins frequently. \n\nMy main account is over level 100 and all i ever really get is champion shards and occasional blue essence. I've had 1 purple gemstone for a long time and that's about it. I end up having tons of mastery tokens but don't have the champion shards i actually need to upgrade them without spending all my blue essence on the mastery token. 3900 blue essence is a lot for a mastery symbol. xD\n\nI feel like the loot/reward system should be similar to maybe Heroes of the Storm... where you have chances of purchasing certain skins if you save up enough in game reward currency over time... and in HotS and even Smite they have Mastery Skins that vary. That would basically be equivalent to your Chroma skins mostly. They have Gold skins, Diamond Skins and in HotS they have themed skins for masteries.\n\nAnd you get daily/weekly rewards more often through missions and such... the only daily you get from League of Legends is a measly FWOTD which grants a petty 50 blue essence or whatever. Like come on now... I have to wait 24 hours to get 50 blue essence... that's insulting. Especially when Invest maybe 6-8 hours or more playing your game almost daily.\n\nI also noticed that the rewards you get while leveling up a new account pre level 30 are basically throwing free shit at you. Which i'm not arguing against that since it's nice to get you started on a new account. But it's annoying that I get more things on my lowbie account in a shorter time frame compared to my Main account that's over level 100...\n\nBut perhaps to solve the Victorious skin solution why not add special portrait inner borders like some of the star guardian or project skins.\nAt least this way the people who got the victorious skins from the achievement can still have something to show that. Where as the people who got it from loot chests would simply have just the skin and not the fancy portrait.\n\nAnd the fact that you have to buy rune pages still bugs me lol.
