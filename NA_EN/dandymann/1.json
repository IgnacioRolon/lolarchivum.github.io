Just being able to experiment with the runes and effectively play roles would be nice. They're so expensive when they could be fun like masteries. People also call you out for having the wrong runes, which sucks. \"Sorry I didn't have the 20000 Ip needed to have the right rune page.

Now to use your argument.  \"**How about whining about \" Runes are too expensive\" why not play the game and earn them the same way everyone else does?**\n\n\nSee what I did there?

(I really don't think T1 and T2 runes should even exist, but thats a separate argument entirely)\n\nAnd I HAVE gotten the runes I need the same way everyone else bloody does, that doesn't change the situation of them being a serious pain in the ass to get sometimes, notably some quints cost upwards of 2000 IP and you have to blow a 6300 champions worth of IP just to get *3* of those runes.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FirstSergeantBim","date":"2015-03-24T19:52:22.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While they might not be making Runes cheaper, they're giving us party rewards for queueing with friends.
