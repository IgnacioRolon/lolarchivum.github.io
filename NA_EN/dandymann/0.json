[Link](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=293417). Zileas talked about it in 2010\n\n[Discussing \"Burden of Knowledge\"]\n\n> \"This is a VERY common pattern amongst hardcore novice game designers. This pattern is when you do a complex mechanic that creates gameplay -- ONLY IF the victim understands what is going on. Rupture is a great example -- with Rupture in DOTA, you receive a DOT that triggers if you, the victim, choose to move. However, you have no way of knowing this is happening unless someone tells you or unless you read up on it online... So the initial response is extreme frustration. We believe that giving the victim counter gameplay is VERY fun -- but that we should not place a 'burden of knowledge' on them figuring out what that gameplay might be. That's why we like Dark Binding and Black Shield (both of which have bait and/or 'dodge' counter gameplay that is VERY obvious), but not Rupture, which is not obvious.\"\n\nEarlier in the post, he said more generally and vaguely that \n\n>Rupture contains several basic design 'anti-patterns'.\n\n I would guess that maybe he would also accuse it of being a false choice? You can choose to move or stand still when ruptured, but the consequences of moving are severe enough that you would almost always want to stand still. \n\nAnyways, I'm not necessarily agreeing or disagreeing with Zileas. I just thought I'd throw this out there. I remember reading this post years ago and thinking it was pretty interesting. I'd never heard a game developer talk, in such depth, about design goals and traps before. Even if you don't always agree with him, it's a cool post.","replies":[{"poster":"SexyTaylorSwift","date":"2015-06-02T17:39:37.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, but when you first playing, that literally holds true for every single thing.

A player might want to know that it reduces healing, and then hold onto their heals until after it wears off, but other than that it doesn't require any special reaction. It's just a DoT. It's not hard to communicate a simple DoT through VFX and SFX. \"Hey, I'm on fire, and my health is going down. I guess someone applied some kind of burning DoT to me.\"\n\nA rupture-like skill would require a much more specific reaction--you not only have to know that some kind of negative effect has been applied to you, you have to know that, specifically, it damages you if you move. I think it would be hard to communicate the idea \"you aren't allowed to move\" purely through VFX and SFX. You mention a \"ripping noise\" and \"bleeding\"... my first reaction, if I saw this in game without knowing what it did, would be to assume that a simple DoT had been applied to me. There are other \"bleeding\" DoTs in the game. \n\nThere are not very many complicated status effects in League. In my experience, blind probably confuses new players the most, since it is pretty rare and pretty specific. But throwing a huge text box that says \"blind\" over the target certainly helps to clarify here. A player might not immediately understand what it means to be blinded, but they can probably figure it out pretty quickly, just from the word. \n\nI think a rupture-like effect, while potentially cool for players who understand it, would be far and away the most complicated status effect in League, and difficult to communicate properly in-game. Any SFX/VFX could be confused for a normal DoT.

Similar to how Janna's passive works, this hypothetical champion could reduce mobility at a certain range (either through a spell or a passive, but I'm guessing the former would be less OP). If we went the offensive route, it would be a more defensive champion but it would have more versatility due to gap closers on melee champions. If it went down the defensive route, it would just prevent escapes from mobile champions that were unprepared and make it easier to appropriate punish.\n\nI'd opt for the defensive mobility route for the sake of melee champions with gap closers.
