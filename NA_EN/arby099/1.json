How is that anywhere close to what I said? And that Dev Blog didn't seem anywhere close to lecturing to me, actually, nothing that Riot says sounds like lectures. Whoever gave you lectures was bad at it or something, but that sounded like an open attempt to explain what they were doing, why they were doing it, and where they were hoping to take it. Why do you think that Riot should be updating you (or the community) about every single update? That's ridiculous. If only there was a quote about that kind of horrible idea....\n\n>If that's how you think a corporate structure works, you're sadly mistaken.\n\nDamn, thanks for that? They should communicate more though, you're right about that. But I think its being foolish to not look at all the shit that any Riot employee gets anytime they show up on the forums and not understand why they might not want to or might be hesitant to do so. Quite frankly, I just fundamentally believe that the majority of what the League community says isn't worth the time it took them to type it. I don't think there is always value in feedback, at least not in every piece of feedback. Some decisions should be solely Riot's. I don't know if we agree on that or not, but I think both of don't think the other person has any interest in agreeing either way (at least that's the vibe I'm getting from you, could be wrong)\n\nI think you're significantly less important than you think you are. **You** got the silent treatment? You aren't owed a damn thing from Riot. They don't have to tell you shit. Neither you nor anyone else in this community is entitled to anything that you are asking for. \"Being treated worse than garbage\"? Let me grab my tiny violin real quick. Grow up.

Sure, coming here and talking to us after 3 years is a good step in the right direction, but the collaboration is really where you are going to build trust. Nothing you can do going forward will be met with anything but venom without Riot collaborating with the community to build up the trust they need to say \"trust us\".\n\nSkarner's lore retcon, the whole world's lore retcon, the fact that small \"quips\" about champions are supposed to encourage players to go to the website to find out more about a champion, all of these are things the community either disagrees with, or are very vocal about.\n\nDoesn't that seem like a good place to build trust, give and take?

I can still vote on threads in the board (thread-overview) screen though, so the most important votes are still possible.\n\nJayce's lore got adjusted to portray Viktor a bit less as a true villain and more as an understandable villain (Viktor is a great villain). Only lore example I can think of where feedback was acted upon though. \n\nPersonal speculation coming right up:\nIt will be a generic world focused on the champions within them. There will be conflicts between generic factions and while nobody really has a reason to care about the conflicts inherently, the champions interacting with the conflicts will be the focus and the reason to care. While I don't think this is the best story one can tell about Runeterra, with institute or even without, it does make telling stories about champions easier since you don't really have to tell stories about the world anymore, you tell them only to support the champions.\n\nNow if they'd to this but also retcon our champions to be entirely different characters, they should've just started a new lore with new characters. But if they want to keep their characters identities intact during the retconning to this new world, I'm fine with it (Runaan posted on na forums they want to do this). Only thing is they already messed up with Trundle (I created a [thread](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/wTyGbUfK-the-characters-migration-to-the-new-lore) about this).\n\nI do want to thank the Rioters still daring to post on forums, I'd upvote you all if I could for the effort alone.

Purple side camera?  A multitude of champion reworks and VU's?  Everything we have been told is coming has been false.  It's past the point of frustration.

Well, here's a clue.  You haven't really done anything but esports for years.  Seriously, the problems can be traced back to when esports started getting popular.   The entire company completely lost sight of the entire community and you focus on a few players.  You give them almost EVERYTHING the community has been asking for.  It's a big slap in the face to everybody.  \n\nProbably deserved heat?  Are you serious?  Even now after all this outrage and backlash you guys still can't say you did something wrong.  Well hot damn you guys must be infallible then.  In all seriousness the community hasn't seen much or heard much of anything from anybody in years.

Real shocker I know, it baffles the mind to think that these paid professionals might actually know something about their game that the people who aren't paid to design and maintain it don't.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2014-09-08T02:17:26.677+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"nobody is insulting them? but a lot of people are hugly disappointed in what they offer...\n\nthere´s a huge difference between criticism and insulting someone.  Just giving them even more time after 2years of silence to \"show this is the correct decuision\" won´t do. They should have been prepared to come up with a lot more than that if they really want to tear appart the work of their predecessors and the sole reasoning behind the gameplay.","replies":[{"poster":"MackleDoge","date":"2014-09-08T02:40:53.139+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":">nobody is insulting them?\n\nThat is just a straight up lie.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2014-09-07T23:32:59.351+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"I would have prefered another 10years of silence to this reveal of a horrible massaker of the current lore...\nand not communicating ever since, not reacting to a ton of good and constructive ideas on how to keep the lore as it is with minor fixes just is even worse than being silent forever.","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2014-09-08T07:05:02.641+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"Yeah i prefer the Lore dead that in a kind of growth\"\nsrsly?","replies":[{"poster":"PhailRaptor","date":"2014-09-08T23:02:58.954+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the thing.  The Lore isn't growing.  It's being replaced.\n\nIt's like gardening.  You relanscaped your yard a few months ago, and there's this 1 plant that is growing just fine, you just don't like how the foliage is sitting.  Rather than pruning it and working with the branches to get the shape you want on a perfectly healthy plant, you rip it out and put in another plant in it's place.","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2014-09-09T04:50:59.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Soo you are basically saying that they are doing well, since theyr plant ( lore is only a part of the game ) is not growing well and that they need to eradicate it, indipendently the attachment of people to that plant?\n\nEDIT: reread the comment, not sure i understood well.
