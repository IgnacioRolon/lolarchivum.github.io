I&#039;m tired of seeing the safe, easy to use, high damage, low risk mages in every game. Why bother picking high risk skillshot champs like {{champion:99}}  or {{champion:101}}  when the reward is the same with safer picks like the boring old {{champion:61}} ,{{champion:134}}, {{champion:69}},{{champion:163}}  ? The problem with mages is that even though they&#039;re SUPPOSED to be the magical bursty class, only the ones with short cd aoe/targetted and therefore high dps mages are picked. Gone are the days where hard to land skillshot combos are rewarded with mages. The risk is simply too high. With AP items constantly getting the shaft in terms of cost efficiency compared to AD items, it seems the pool of viable mages keeps shrinking smaller and smaller. Let&#039;s not even mention how these same champions require half the mana, time, and sometimes even half the cds ({{champion:112}} ) needed to clear waves. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I know buffing long range mages would just let them 100-0 you from fog of war, but I&#039;d really like to see these risky picks have higher payoffs than they do now. Burst means almost nothing this season with the clusterfuck of shields and heals flying around, but at least AD assassins hardly ever have to land single target skillshots to do their job, and even so, their auto attacks still hurt like trucks while long range mages have to sit around sucking their thumbs until their cds are up again once they miss. Overall, I feel like this season has the been the worst season in terms of champion viability and I&#039;m not expecting Rito to have any bright ideas... ever really. Until then, let&#039;s just all play the good ol AD Ranged Point Click Sustained Burst DPS sub-class consisting of {{champion:119}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:18}}","replies":[{"poster":"Smitty Manjensen","date":"2017-09-25T13:00:12.123+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":10,"body":"What's with the circlejerk of mages being unviable?

Lux has to use her only consistent damage tool (E) to farm, WHICH CANT EVEN 1SHOT backline casters, thus causing her to walk up into dangerous territory to get cs. Meanwhile, Taliyah can walk up one time, use e followed by a q or two depending on the stage of the game, and wipe out the whole wave, while lux's e is STILL on CD.

Trust me xerath is my most played champ, and these times are very often. \n\n> Just because he can be countered by someone if they engage on him doesn't mean he is risky\n\nThe thing is that he has no safety net.  Most mages have some form of safety net, either hard cc, shields or something inbetween. Lux has shield and a decent root. Ziggs has a knock back for himself and the enemy, viktor has a shield and a potential aoe strong stun, syndra has a knock back and a strong aoe stun, orianna has shield and a strong aoe knock back,  anivia has wall, stun, and a strong aoe slow, brand has a situational strong stun. There more mages with safety nets. Xerath is not one of them. He has only a mediocre slow that sometimes is a strong one and a useless stun ( and by that i mean that most of the times is more or less ~1 sec, 2 sec is very difficult since it needs max range ) which at point blank is fking 0.5. Riot might as well change it to just interrupting since it cant do anything else. Hell sometimes i feel like im playing without e. \n\n> laning with Xerath is about as unrisky as you can get. You just sit back and use your abilities\n\nNot true at all. He cant just cs with his spells since they cost shittons of mana even after lost chapter. Not only that but his spells are easy as fk to evade too so poking isnt difficult to deal with.. All it takes is a singe click at the right or left. \n\n>  You don't need to be anywhere near the action, as opposed to a champion with less range (ex. Cass, Aurelion, Viktor, GP)\n\nTrue.

Though generally speaking, its not good to keep champions balanced around buffs. \n\n> Target the enemy champion.\n\nProvided the enemy player has eyes and basic judgement skill he should be able to avoid most of the times my slow moving-delayed spells unless he is under the effects of movement impairments. Hell they can avoid it even with the minor slow on the w.  And no there is no git gud on this one.

Just sayin. \n\n> After 10 minutes you almost never need to use Xerath's passive\n\nNo? Even after 10 mins, unless your team has a clear advantage at teamfights ( to proc the mana regen from morello) you will need now and then some aa preferably on the enemy champs because his mana costs are insane.  If you dont trust me, go play some games with xerath. And watch your mana pool. \n\n>  Xerath has a stun, and it nowhere near as uselesss as you are saying it is\n\nEm yes it is, at least compared to other single target hard cc. It can hardly save your ass since it is only 0.5 and it is slow as fk. \n\n> Viktor's stun can just be dashed, and even walked out of\n\nGiven the fact that it is a strong aoe hard cc that later on can also knock down, yeah its only natural to be able to dashed and walked of. But still it can save you compared to xerath's stun. It also can zone the shit out of the enemy. \n\n> Zigg's knockback is not that good.\n\nWhat? It can give him a very good amount of distance between him and the enemy that has jumped onto him. His w sends ziggs 400 units away. Thats insane considering his position as mage. Also compared to other hard cc its unaffected by tenacity. \n\n> Orianna's \"strong knockback\" is her ult is her ult. It has over a 100 second cooldown on level 6\n\nTrue. Her e though has lower cd, and gives her resistances. \n\n>  Xerath has a stun that has a little over a 10 second cooldown. You are acting like his stun is useless when it isn't.\n\nA stun that is made to be strong at long range and weak as shit at low. Let me tell you how many times this 'good' skill has saved me. A zed using ulti on me. I  predict where he will appear after ulti and stun him. I try to gain distance to be able to avoid his multiple q and e. Though there is only so far you get away when the stun duration is 0.5.( for the sake of this argument i havent bought zhyonias yet. ).\n\n Or another one. A kata e right in front of me. She is lvl 6 and i know that she might ulti me (50-50). In one instance she doesnt, which ends up of me wasting my e, and after 0.5 sec she regains control and uses the rest of her kit to obliterate me to smithereens in a matter of a second. On the contrary she does use ulti and i end up cancelling her ulti, but alas its only 0.5 sec, i cant gain enough distance and she uses her basic abilities to kill me.  \n\n> His mana costs are similar to everyone else's.\n\nNo its not.

In Lux&#x27;s case, you have one long cd, high mana costing, mediocore damage ability to farm with. You WILL easily get pushed in, lose cs under tower, get bullied, and fall behind. Lux is heavily gated by mana costs while these other mages can not only out damage her, but completely outclass her in farming, consistency, roaming, AND teamfighting.

What is usually the issue is insufficient damage in teamfights because of being pure long CD skillshot champ. She needs better items tbqh (as do most mages) to be competitive, but then the OP mages will be roflstomping around the game again, so really, first problem to fix is the remaining OP mage picks OPness, then fix items, then we have healthier, better mages for the game with proper items for them too.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"zaire90","date":"2017-09-25T18:54:12.647+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How tf is lux or xerath high risk theyre some of the safer mages.
