We're talking radioactive fallout levels here. Lead in the drinking water, \"somebody poisoned the water hole\" stuff. Normally I try to ignore this stuff, not let it affect me. But I'm ashamed to say this time I snapped and fired back. I threw all their vitriol back at them and then some. It felt good at the time, but now I feel just kind of scummy and frankly if these jerks try to report ME now they might have a foothold to do get a real punishment going, even though this is the first time I've ever done something like this. So I have to ask, for the future: how do YOU deal with toxic players? Any relaxation tips or thought processes that might help me (or others) from losing their cool in the future?","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-10-31T06:34:44.491+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"You just mute them.

Your advice is probably terrible for anyone to follow. Your positivity only masks your ignorance.  You've said nothing but the same thing over and over which means you've said absolutely nothing and the OP or myself has nothing to gain from further discussion with you.","replies":[{"poster":"Xikini","date":"2016-10-31T13:00:38.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"And again, you give nothing in return but chaos.\nI feel pity for you stuck in the lower elo's, wanting to get better, but still stuck there because you refuse to acknowledge that you yourself have something to improve upon.\n\nClearly this is wasted time for both you and me.\n\nIf OP responds wanting more detailed information regarding particular subjects or aspects where they believe they can improve, I'll return to provide it.\n\nIf your actually interested in improving you'll take the time to research the topics I listed previously and ask direct questions to what you don't understand instead of coercing someone to write a novel of information your unlikely to comprehend.","replies":[{"poster":"ReadyxPlayerxOne","date":"2016-10-31T13:31:56.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Xikini,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=ojcHEHx5,comment-id=000300000000000000000001000000000000,timestamp=2016-10-31T13:00:38.154+0000)\n>\n> And again, you give nothing in return but chaos.\n> I feel pity for you stuck in the lower elo&#x27;s, wanting to get better, but still stuck there because you refuse to acknowledge that you yourself have something to improve upon.\n> \n> Clearly this is wasted time for both you and me.\n> \n> If OP responds wanting more detailed information regarding particular subjects or aspects where they believe they can improve, I&#x27;ll return to provide it.\n> \n> If your actually interested in improving you&#x27;ll take the time to research the topics I listed previously and ask direct questions to what you don&#x27;t understand instead of coercing someone to write a novel of information your unlikely to comprehend.\n\nYou are so arrogant and assumptive it's disgusting.

They don't know what they are saying, maybe they had a bad day. I don't like to admit it, but even I become a bit toxic when the game isn't going well.  However, if you have pity on them and do not want to mute them, or talk back, the best option is kindness. Ask them if they are having a bad day, or if they are feeling well. In fact, one player has been very toxic in my game, and I asked if they are feeling okay. What was the persons response?\n\nTheir grandmother died that day. \n\nToxic players are humans too, they need sympathy. They sometimes are players that need attention. although we can try to get them banned, we can also let them change.","replies":[{"poster":"YourBoiDerpus","date":"2019-03-07T21:12:03.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also want to talk about enemy toxic players.
