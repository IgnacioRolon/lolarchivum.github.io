Once I downloaded the update I tried launching the game as well, just like you had, and it also crashed and wouldn't reopen. Immediately after my MalwareBytes also found Ransomware and quarantined it. I had assumed that I could have downloaded the previous day but this could be Riot's fault depending on how many people have it.","replies":[{"poster":"1PE1Cr4sh","date":"2017-04-20T11:42:43.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it happened to me too.\n\nAlso Malwarebytes\n\nEU West.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"unlucky game","date":"2017-04-20T05:46:19.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Had the same thing happen today, un-installed and re-installed and everything is working fine. {{champion:222}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"z0x","date":"2017-04-20T04:04:09.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same happened to me.

When league updates, it's replacing game files with new ones and your program might be detecting it as a threat.  Update your antivirus definitions as well to be sure.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
