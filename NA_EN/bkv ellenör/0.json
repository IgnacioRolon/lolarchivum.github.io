These leaves cause negative experiences for other players, so it's important to get this resolved!

My game always gives me this \"corrupt file\" bs, and has to rescan. Next thing I get a leaverbuster. Maybe you should fix the game issues. Also, the /remake should be 5 mins, not 3 or whatever it is now, because on average it takes about 5 mins for the damn client to rescan the files. How is that even fair? Not much can happen in 5 minutes. Why punish people for 5 minutes?","replies":[]},{"poster":"WarDesigner","date":"2016-08-13T02:36:40.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you guys have another message to copy and paste? That's exactly the same message your terrible customer support pasted as an answer to my ticket, without even reading my message. Your game has a bug, go read the other threads. It is not our fault when the game crash because of you and we lose points plus we get disrespected when we contact the customer support. My ticket was closed and my issue was not even resolved.\nAND WE CAN NOT EVEN SPEAK TO A MANAGER?

I have had internet issues that I have now hopefully resolved both in my old apartment and now my new place.  I got leaver buster for 20  minutes.  Why is it that after waiting for 20 minutes I cannot invite other players to join my team? I've already served a penalty, why do they have to get punished as well? As a result I now served 3 20 minute sessions for 1 leaver buster game. In total I will have served a penalty of 8 games. How is that fair at all?","replies":[]}]}
