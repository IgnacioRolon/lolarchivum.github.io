My first thought was to uninstall and reinstall. The uninstall was successful, but upon trying to reinstall the game, I always get the same error message: unspecified error. I've tried running the Hextech Repair Tool, but when I go to my Riot Games folder, I don't actually have the client .exe file, just the launcher, so I cant actually run the tool. I really want to get back into the game, so some help would be greatly appreciated. I'm running on windows 10.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-28T04:41:56.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm yea missing that client.exe is going to be a problem. I'd suggest running the Repair Tool with the options **clean uninstall and reinstall** turned on to make sure all the files were properly wiped and then get reinstalled correctly.","replies":[]}]}
