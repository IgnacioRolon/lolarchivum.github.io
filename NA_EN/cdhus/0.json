Also, you did not get banned for that one game. You got punished for that one game, perhaps. What you got banned for, was a pattern of bad behavior.

Saying EASY or EZ is ultimate way to attempt to humiliate opponent and its considered very toxic and unsportsmanlike by most of community and RIOT. Its as if u would go to opposing player during football match and start laughing at him cause he lost instead of shaking hands like a true sportsman. And before u try to pull EZ MEANS EZREAL card, i checked your match history, that game didnt have EZREAL in it. So u clearly used it as an insult. Yes, your ban is deserved.
