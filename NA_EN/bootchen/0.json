I would love to hear other peoples feedback though.\r\n\r\nI have been playing LOL for a few years now and its really the only game I play. Thanks for making an awesome game. I've played thousands of games and was Plat1 last season. I think I could have gotten to diamond if I went full try hard but that is not always fun. I understand the game pretty well and I have a bunch of problems with a champion...Pantheon. He was the 1st champion I spammed because I thought Spartans are so cool. After years of experience playing LOL I feel Pantheon needs a rework. I can't even stand to play him anymore.\r\n\r\nHe is always way ahead or way behind in games. I understand snowball champs but pantheon games are pretty much decided in the first 10 minutes of play. If you don't have a big lead by then hes useless.\r\n\r\nExcuse my language but Pantheon is a \"mana whore\" and theirs nothing to do about it. A number of champions in LOL are \"mana whores\" but every other champ has an item that they can build to make up for this. AP champs can go tear, ROA, morellonomicon, lichbane. Champs like Ezreal, Jayce, GP also can go tear or Tri. Supports and tanks have Frozen heart/iceborn gauntlet. Pantheon might just be the only champ that does not have a logical mana item to build that needs it.\r\n\r\nHe has no skill shots. Its hard to outplay someone when your champion has no skill shots. He either dominates lane opponents or gets crushed by them. \r\n\r\nPantheon's ult is inconsistent. Shen, TF, TK, Ryze, and Galio all have roaming ults and are much more useful/consistent. Pantheons ult takes so long to channel that it is total luck sometimes when using it. It's hard to make picks and easy to suicide with because the channel is so long.\r\n\r\nWith the Meta the way it is Pantheons ult is not that useful toplane. Many times after ulting I've returned to lane just to get destroyed because I lost so much exp from roaming. Since Pantheon does not have good wave clear its almost impossible to not fall behind after roaming. Pantheon's ult would be good as a jungler but his clear speed is way to slow to keep up with meta junglers.\r\n\r\nLastly Pantheon has no way out of fights. Once you go in its kill or be killed(In team fights it's usually be killed), he has no way of running away like all other melee champions do. Unlike tanks that have sustain and can take a beating Pantheon usually just dies in teamfights once he goes in. I find it kind of ironic that the champion with a shield is not that good at blocking damage. Also anyone who saw 300 knows Spartans excel in team fights....Pantheon not so much. If you play Pantheon you get use to seeing the grey screen. \r\n\r\nI totally agree champions should have strengths/weaknesses and one champion should not have it all but Pantheon I feel is far from balanced. \r\nPlease please please rework Pantheon. I want to play him again so bad, he just feels terrible to play the way he is. \r\nSorry for rambling on but this has been bugging me for sometime now and I really want to play him again. \r\nThank you for reading my long message, I really do appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-03-31T15:04:04.811+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree, he needs a full VGU imo. \n\nPersonally I think he should get a weapon swap ability to better emphasize mastery of combat.","replies":[{"poster":"Cremepie","date":"2017-03-31T20:50:10.312+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can see it now.\nPantheon master of the spear, sword, shield, axe, fist, and oven.","replies":[{"poster":"Sheen Estevez","date":"2017-03-31T21:28:22.664+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"baguette","replies":[{"poster":"Gaming Spider19","date":"2018-01-11T19:05:40.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"to be said in a  french accent :   HUH HUH HUH!!!!!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DonGiovanni","date":"2017-03-31T22:52:39.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Already has one: his auto attacks are spear jabs, his q is spear throw.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-03-31T23:03:10.982+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"But he should draw a short sword after throwing his spear.","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2017-04-01T15:53:07.694+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly.... that's not a bad idea.

Really enjoyed playing him but I felt he came up short on the \"Aspect of War\" motif. Very cool thematically but not executed fully. I do love the spartan look however. It feels right.\n\nOne thing I think would be really cool on Panth would be a Stance ability. Kind of like a toggle ability. Toggled on, Panth gets in a defensive stance putting up his shield, taking reduced damage and blocking skill shots for people behind him, similar to Braum but in a much smaller area. While he is in the stance, he moves much slower and has reduced attack range but can still use abilities. He can be in the stance indefinitely. When toggled off after being in the stance, he will stun everyone near him in a small aoe with his shield for a brief period. It then goes on cooldown.\n\nI also think he should be able to incorporate a short sword of some sort. Spartans were not solely known for their spear prowess. Spears were not strong at close range so if he could swap weapons, that would be very cool.\n\nThese are just some ideas I have had after playing him for years and I think they would work really well if incorporated correctly! Thanks for reading! Leave a comment if you like. Would love to see Riot use the toggle stance ability in some manner on him.","replies":[{"poster":"Bootchen","date":"2017-04-01T02:03:07.498+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like the toggle idea similar to nid, jayce, elise, rek.

The stance I'm referring to is less Nidalee and Jayce \"changing stance/abilities\" and more of a Braum and reworked Galio hybrid \"crouch and stand up\" ability. You get the personal Braum shield that can block abilities for themselves and probably only 1 person behind them but also the slowed defensive stance of Galio. However, unlike Braum, you don't go faster with the ability toggled on and the shield up and, unlike Galio, it is not channeled so it can be up indefinitely. Once the ability is toggled off, you get the signature Panth stun at close range but it is more AOE instead of single target and he does not leap so it isn't as large of a range. Then it would go on cooldown, probably a longer than normal one. Out of the stance, he is still fast, strong and quick as a killer much like current Panth. I was inspired by watching the historical battle strategies of the Spartan warriors and I noticed their fighting style was composed of two main phases: the first being the exposed, fast fighters which 300 really shows. The second being a very defensive squat like position, usually accompanied by other warriors on each side very close to each other. They moved very slowly but very deliberately. Since League has become such a speed game, it would be nice to see a historical fighting style be incorporated that forces the other team to anticipate your slow movements rather than fast ones..","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2017-03-31T21:17:24.209+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"it doesnt help that they keep needlessly nerfing him. \n\n* 1st was not having his shield passive block Drag's attacks when he was seeing play in the jungle due to him being able to get Dragon early. Meanwhile Warwick is able to solo 3min Drag at lvl2 and other champs who can easily solo it early.\n\n\n* 2nd which I consider the worst is nerfing his E AD bonus ratio from 1.2 to 1.0 and his base by 40 at max rank. Also see no reason why they shouldnt revert his E tick back to 5 times instead of 3 anymore for Black Cleaver. If Garen is allowed to proc BC fully in quick succession ON TOP of his additional 25% armor shred, why cant Panth?\n\n\n* 3rd was removing his mana refund when canceling his Ult. \n\n\n* 4th was adjusting Essence Reaver to be more ADC focused. I liked the original Essence Reaver when it gave +50 AD, 10% life steal, 10% cooldown reduction, and basic attacks restore mana equal to between 2% and 8% of the physical damage dealt, based on your missing mana. I found a lot of use for the likes of Jayce and Pantheon. Would love to see that version come back as another item.\n\nI used to play him mid all the time but now I cant find a reason to play him at all in general. He cant waveclear without building a lot of AD because of E's dmg reduction to non champs and he cant tank without building tank. Its like the game itself is actively working against him. Reworked Galio is now a much better version of Pantheon and he can deal damage without building damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2017-03-31T23:37:33.788+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont know why this has been getting downvotes.

I'd trade out the spear for a sword as well. A suggestion for his Q is maybe a weapon thrust that hits target enemy and enemies behind in a line similar to Yasuo's Q, except it isnt treated as a basic attack. This could adjust early game power, reward skilled play, and provide improved lategame contribution for his team. (It would also look cool to see him thrust a weapon so hard it goes through his enemies). His W is generally agreed to be his most powerful and least counterplay ability for most it seems. I would recommend doing a sort of swap with his passive. His new W would give the current shield passive every 4 attacks, and give it an active to increase attack speed and movespeed by a percentage for a time. This gives him more clear highs and lows for players to utilize and play against. And gives him better jungling ability.  His E is something I would change heavily. Currently this new Pantheon would have some poke and sustain, so lets give him some utility here better round out his kit so far. I recommend a  combat roll similar to Vayne's vault where upon hitting an enemy Pantheon cripples them with his spear slowing them and reducing their armor by a percentage temporarily, and dealing bleed damage over time, on a moderate cooldown. This allows for mobility, gives him solid cc, powerful ganks, strong dueling and an escape when he needs it. To finish off his abilities, for his R I think that he should completely ditch the old map hopping for something else. So far we have poke, durability, mobility, and cc. His new ultimate would passively give him a good amount of tenacity and he could activate it to launch a spear skillshot with range that spans about midlane that ignores increasingly more percent armor the lower the enemies health is. It would have charges that refill over time similar to corki's ultimate.  This would let him pick off fleeing enemies, engage from a distance and look like a spartan who knows how to wield a spear. For his passive I'd give him a percent of his mana regained per champion kill or assist or large or epic jungle monster slain to give him long teamfight potential and jungle clear","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GrReaper96","date":"2017-04-02T00:02:05.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While pantheon is pretty linear and direct, its not like he is in a particularly bad spot.
