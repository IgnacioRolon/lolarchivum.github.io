I decided I'd pick it back up over the summer, and I come to find out I am permanently banned. Is there a way to appeal / can i get some info on why I am banned?

It is possible that the punishment occurred immediately after you stopped playing, and it was never seen since you took a break.  However, if you are confident that you did nothing on your account to warrant a suspension and believe it was hacked, then make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).  Our agents should be able to work with you one-on-one in order to get to investigate deeper.","replies":[]}]}
