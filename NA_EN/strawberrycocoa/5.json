The idea is that you can attack her and it stops the vessel damage and prevents the debuff right? But she basically auto-wins in melee fights thanks to massive tentacle slaps. And if you try to clear out tentacles, you eat more slaps or lose farm or both.\r\n\r\nSo, if the intent behind her design is to &quot;stand up to her&quot; when she &quot;tests&quot; you, why are melee trades with her so god damned one-sided?","replies":[{"poster":"GaleWinUnleashed","date":"2016-04-19T02:31:30.384+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you move a bit so you're not right next to your detached soul, Illaoi has to make a choice. She can either chase you down and deal more damage while you're \"stuck\" in the area trying not to make yourself a vessel by leaving your soul behind. Or she can attempt to kill the soul, which sits nice and still so she can do her maximum dps to it with no problem. Option 2 also includes the handy bonus of transferring some of the damage to you.\n\nBasically, it seems the second option is slightly overloaded if Illaoi's objective is to create a vessel by any means she can. Could perhaps use some tuning so that Illaoi has more incentive to attack you directly (inversely, give her less incentive to sit and smack your soul), even while your soul is sitting there making itself a nice target.\n\nWhat if the damage transfer percentage was nerfed a bit? Do you think that might lessen the lose-lose feel of your options once you're grabbed?\n\nOf course she also has some adjustments coming in with ~~Wednesday's~~ **the 6.9** patch, so perhaps that will fix your problems.","replies":[{"poster":"YCitizenSnipsY","date":"2016-04-19T02:36:36.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As some one else said in the thread, they are removing the condition where fighting Illoai makes the vessel dissapear faster. She is a juggernaut, you aren't supposed to just walk up to them and fight them. If they wanted to make her force you to she should have been given a different CC, not something that still punishes you for exploiting  the intended weakness of the class and getting away from her. \n\nDarius pull and Garen silence do this better since you can still technically get away from them once its happened without further punishment, depending on how fed they are.","replies":[{"poster":"GaleWinUnleashed","date":"2016-04-19T02:51:32.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair point with the Juggernaut and CC-type thing, though I'm pretty sure I didn't so much as hint at the debuff-time reduction that's used currently.

As a melee champion I already now Illaoi will wreck my shit inside her zones of power, but having a disengagement strategy ALSO allow her to still make my day miserable just feels shitty. It's like once Vessel is cast there's not much you can do except pick a method of minimizing how much damage you take, either by risking a tentacle slap from standing toe-to-toe with her, or resign yourself to dodging line shots and clearing out tentacles.\n\nI think the whole tentacle mini-game is kind of an aggravation point in itself, while I'm griping. It's just a bit too much time spent NOT pushing your own objectives, whether that be trading with Illaoi or farming. I don't really like anything that puts power into AI and not the player, and Vessel's tentacle spawns are completely AI based damage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xl Kirito lx","date":"2016-04-19T02:24:53.588+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of the biggest mistakes I see people make when fighting her is not understanding how the vessel works.  The vessel echoes 35%+ of damage it takes onto you.  Illaoi's going to attempt to line up spawn hits to hit the vessel, and the champion, effectively dealing 135%+ damage to the champion.  \n\nYou stand and fight, but you have to position correctly to do so.","replies":[{"poster":"Strawberrycocoa","date":"2016-04-19T02:28:59.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ugh, no wonder I exploded whenever I tried to fight her.

She is just to immobile to have any real impact on the game.  At least darius has pull and garen gets a speed buff but they only way illaoi wins is if you don't kite.  \n\nHer q is so goddam slow its pretty much always dodge-able, and if she ever uses ulti then just straight up walk away. Don't even look back, just walk away.\n\nOnto her vessel.\n\nWhen you get hit by it you got one of two options.  \n\nIf you think you can dodge her q while fighting her then go in.  Even if she hits q on vessel then its not enough damage to really win her the trade.  (obviously if she has tentacles nearby then back off).\n\nIf you can't dodge her q due to low mobility/in tight spaces or jungle etc. Then just leave. \n\nHonestly I'm surprised she is still played,  she offers pretty much nothing to her team. The only way she wins teamfights is if the enemy keeps fighting after she ultis.  Just run away and then re-engage after.\n\nJust my two cents.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ViashinoWizard","date":"2016-04-19T02:26:04.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is probably why they're removing the \"damage Illaoi to reduce spirit duration\" mechanic and adjusting the length accordingly.","replies":[{"poster":"Strawberrycocoa","date":"2016-04-19T02:29:44.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh that's really good too here, the debuff lasts way too damn long if you try to disengage.
