That's why different damage types exist and for that very same reason there are almost no items that grant both Armor and Magic Resist (2 on summoner's rift - Zz'Rot Portal and Guardian Angel) - to encourage teams to use mixed damage types, instead of multiple physical ones (or magical ones for that matter).\n\nOf course, there is also The Black Cleaver, but I don't know the exact interaction between it's armor reduction and Last Whisper's penetration (but I presume that Black Cleaver reduction applies to bonus armor first and only lowers base if bonus is not sufficient).\n\nThat said, TBC is still extremely good against armor - possibly better than Last Whisper and its upgrades, but you have to stack it on the target (which may be difficult depending on the champion you are playing).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"bobsenbob","date":"2015-12-10T02:35:53.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"then again, it also lost 1000 g in cost and 15 ad so since 15 ad is worth 525 g, it's 475g cheaper and has the new passive.
