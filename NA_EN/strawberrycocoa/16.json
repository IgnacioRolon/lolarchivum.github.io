According to the Pool Party event page, groups of 5 only earn points when they WIN. So 50% of the people grouping up and playing in 5s to contribute to the event are contributing NOTHING because every 5 man that loses their game provides zero progress to unlocking the reward tiers. A lesser contribution for losing teams, even just 1 point, would at LEAST let us feel like we're helping push towards the top prizes, but nope. Half of the people playing the event aren't doing a damn thing to unlock rewards.\r\n\r\nAnd that 50/50 success rate is the only way to contribute through gameplay. The other two options require spending real money to contribute points. And be honest, how many people are going to do that? How many people are going to spend their hard earned money to contribute towards prize tiers that may or may not even happen, when they could just buy Pool Party Mundo after the skins release and be guaranteed to get it? Except for the icon and mystery champion, every other tier is a temporary reward. Who is going to spend their real world money for a prize like Pool Party Minions that only lasts for the week of the event?\r\n\r\nReally, it's gating the biggest point contributions behind real money that irritates me. Why not reward players for competing and grouping and PLAYING the game? Why create an event that's built and designed to milk more money out of the playerbase? In events gone past the icons and the special minions would have simply been rolled out as part of the event.

Riot's been in this business for five years now, how is running an event \"new\" to them?\n\nThe problem is (which riot will never admit out right) that the company has become a bit of a revolving door outside of key members, especially the past 3 years.\n\nThey keep breaking teams into other teams, moving people around, hiring new people, people leaving, changing teams up, etc. So the team that made a successful event this year (Assuming there is one) most likely won't be the same team that makes even the same event next year, so they won't have learned anything, as the group that did it and learned, is probably going to be doing something else, if not gone completely.\n\nPart of the reason the lore, as an example, is a mess. They have had what...3-4 different people in charge in 2-3 years? Same goes for many other areas as well, they just don't advertise that fact.\n\nIt is like a sports team changing players year in and year out. Sure they did it right last year, but if half the roster is gone, they have to learn to do it right all over again. Biggest problem Riot has, and the main reason things take forever to get done.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-06-21T12:12:23.396+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If what you say about shifting resources too often is true then that's a massive problem.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Alipheese is bae","date":"2015-06-20T19:55:19.948+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've queued up for a few, and we've not won a 5 man yet\nRIP","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Poro","date":"2015-06-20T20:31:21.755+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I lost 10 (Yes TEN!)

I just noticed that NA community organization was FAR FAR worse than EUW and EUNE one in this aspect. \nIn EU forum there was these two threads made by a Wrenchman, Eambo, that explained clearly how to join chats for getting points\n\nThis is the thread for EUW (there is also one for EUNE who has more or less the same info, it is redundant to link both)\n\nhttp://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment-en/Fjf25Eho-euw-pool-party-recruitment-thread-and-chat-room\n\nIf you go on NA Team Recruitment forum you don't find a well explained thread on how to find people to play together. Heck, you don't find anything there of any help. \nI suspect that if someone will give us information about how the various regions were contributing by collecting points during the entire initiative, NA will end up being one of the worst regions involved in points collected/number of players active on the server/number of games played during the week ratio because NA community did not receive any help on how to organize theirselves to get premade teams and collect points","replies":[]},{"poster":"AshBlakeNeo","date":"2015-06-21T07:37:43.281+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"when is the pool party end? can anyone tell me about that please","replies":[]},{"poster":"FluxBound","date":"2015-06-21T06:33:32.904+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much all NA players got cheated because as mentioned by a Rioter, OcE server got Ocean Week, apparently much easier than this mountain climb.

It's not on the pre-login launcher, the login screen, and on the client it only has a small box since river king was announced. Even on the website it doesn't have a very noticeable spot on the main page.\n\nAlso, they didn't actually release the pool party skins alongside the event!!!!! Whaaat???\n\nThis is a global event!
