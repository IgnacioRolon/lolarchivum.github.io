The number one thing that people new to the role or not great at it struggle with is knowing your attack range. Name the marksman/men you're playing and without looking it up can you tell me their attack range and if they have a range modifier what it goes up to. Can you ping the edge of your range in game? What about move speed? Do you know how long your attack animation is? These highly specific details are what separate mechanically intensive players from others. My game knowledge sucks because I make mistakes like getting overly aggresive, or not warding enough.

Working with supports is pretty hard. And different ADCs have different threat ranges and danger situations. -For example, Jhin can't easily approach a Nasus, but Lucian can dodge his wither. \n\nYour safety range will also depend on your teamcomp, tanks and supports especially.
