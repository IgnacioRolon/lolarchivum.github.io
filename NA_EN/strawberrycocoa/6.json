You are also looking at an optimal situation for Zed, because his energy costs go down with level. In the mid game (when Lissandra's wave clear is most relevant to the game because the ADC hasn't ramped up all the way) and the time frame that I was discussing (level 9 for maxed Q) her passive has a much larger impact on her spam than Zed's energy return has at that point. Shadow is almost *never* maxed first, and at rank 5 Q, rank 1 W and rank 2 E like he would have at lvl 9, his total energy cost is 145, and his energy return is only 40 (assuming he hits his Q and E twice), meaning every rotation of WQE costs him 105 net energy, which leaves him OOE after 2-3 full rotations at most, but since he only needs to clear a wave every 30 seconds, he could probably stay topped up for a little more than that. Lissandra meanwhile cleared a wave (before the nerf) with only 1-2 Qs and a couple AAs, meaning she could easily out sustain a Zed in the mid game if she is focusing on just pushing the wave as it comes.\n\nRegardless, I don't think either champion is OP or broken really, they are both just a bit strong.","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-03-12T17:26:38.014+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"A thought provoking post with some good points. \n\n> My point is still 100% valid that she can spam Q much more often than Zed can\n\nWhile that is true my only point is that was not the whole story. \n\n> You are also looking at an optimal situation for Zed, because his energy costs go down with level.\n\nThat is also the optimal situation for Lissandra, because her cd's go down with level and her maximum mana goes up her mana regen goes up by level etc.... \n\n> her passive has a much larger impact on her spam than Zed's energy return\n\nZed's 80 energy return (because both q and e give 40 energy return each) gives him more than enough energy for a spell every time his shadow is up, which is 18 seconds at lv 1, so i think they are pretty comparable. \n\nlv 9 then. \n\nHis weq costs a total of 145 energy with an 80 energy return. + 6 seconds eq costs 105 +6 seconds eq costs 105 +6 seconds weq again. This pattern costs 355 energy, he returned 80, and regenerated 180 energy for a net cost of only 95 energy. You aren't counting his energy regen which makes a HUGE difference. He gets 6 full rotations of abilities on cd and then he skips one eq combo and can continue this pattern. He can use abilities on cd for 5/6 of the time. \n\n> Regardless, I don't think either champion is OP or broken really, they are both just a bit strong.\n\nI know that neither of them is OP, in fact i think zed is underpowerd but any straight up numbers buffs will likely reinforce a playstyle that is unhealthy for the game. If anything he should be veigar-level reworked without the gutting. In any case i think this exercise into resource management can be enlightening and i find that most people are surprised by zed's actual resource costs when they realize that he can return 80 energy and that procs on minions too.","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-03-12T19:39:06.132+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The energy return actually scales with ranks in W (20/25/30/35/40 energy per double spell hit), so he only gets 40 from hitting both Q and E until W is ranked up. I did account for him getting energy regen, which is why I said instead of running OOE after 2-3 rotations he would be able to do quite a few more by regaining energy naturally between waves. \n\nMy point about Lissandra's passive having more impact is that it gives her a whole free spell, and early on having a whole free spell stretches her mana pool considerably. more than Zed's energy return stretches his, the only difference being that Zed's resource regens faster naturally outside of his energy regaining mechanic.","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-03-13T16:04:29.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The energy return actually scales with ranks in W (20/25/30/35/40 energy per double spell hit)\n\nTouche. at lv 9 you've probably only got one rank in his w. If i redo the math they actually both last around 1:15, so we have come to the conclusion that Zed has comparable (not superior) waveclear to a mage, and doesn't have to go back to regen his resource. \n\nThis is why most people think Zeds waveclear is unfair. He can assassinate, waveclear, roam, splitpush, farm under tower with ease, etc.... He is just good at so many things and waveclear shouldn't be part of an assassins identity, also if his waveclear is nerfed it might be reasonable to increase his assassination power in compensation.
