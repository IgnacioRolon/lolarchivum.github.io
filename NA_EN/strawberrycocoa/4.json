Trundle can dish out easily double Lee Sin's damage over the course of 5 seconds, the problem is that no one is standing around to let trundle murder-fuck them like that. \n\nThis leads to a perception disparity, where people believe Lee does more damage simply because his is easier to apply. They also fail to take into account other factors, such as how insanely tanky trundle gets (while still doing immense damage + stealing stats), while Lee either builds full damage and dies when hit with a point-and-click CC, or bruiser / tank and is largely incapable of killing people on his own.","replies":[{"poster":"Princess Bunhead","date":"2019-02-28T21:25:47.060+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":5,"body":"Garen, Darius, Olaf, etc etc funnily enough actually does less dmg over time, with less mobility, than crap like Jax, Riven, Irelia, and the like - specially at like level 9+. \n\nThe only thing the immobile champions have going for them, is they're slightly tankier, and better in a straight up melee slugfest, where people move little or don't dodge damage.\n\nThe mobile champions have all the agency/mobility, and thus are way better at \"carrying\" when ahead, due to that mobility.

You can argue these things are out of line (and very well could be) but if a character like Riven had no shield, she'd get BTFO the moment she went in.

Alternatively he builds tank but then just does no damage.\n\nGenerally you have to split mobility into two categories: Initiation mobility or escape mobility.
