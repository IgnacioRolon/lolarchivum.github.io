Being literally unable to see people coming, and having those characters enjoying huge damage benefits when bursting out of stealth, it&#039;s just maddening to me. It&#039;s completely insane and ridiculous to me that such a mechanic exists in PVP gameplay. If people want to approach unseen they should have to use terrain and cleverness, handing out invisibility is completely dumb.\r\n\r\nAt least when we had oracles elixir it was manageable, now the only stealth counter is pink wards and they aren&#039;t even invisible anymore so it&#039;s too easy to take them out.\r\n\r\nGrah. It aggravates my shit that people think invisibility skills are in anyway fair or balanced in a PVP environment. &gt;_&lt;\r\n\r\nSorry, I&#039;m still salty from a Nemesis Draft match last night where my idiot team mates picked Twitch and Shaco for the enemy team.

If he puts down a box to try and trap you, it breaks his stealth. The boxes also have an arm time, so just walk around it.\n\nFor Twitch, it's sort of obvious he'a there the vast majority of the time in laning so the only reason he'd have to use it is to run away. Postlaning applies same as Shaco. Deeper wards to prevent flanking and putting a pink near your team if a teamfight looks imminent helps a ton.","replies":[]}]}
