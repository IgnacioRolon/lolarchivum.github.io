Like it was really bad.\nRemember that time Nidalee was dating some random summoner?\n>The Bestial Huntress has long been an object of affection for the male fans of the League (and especially ones less mature than her, hubba hubba!). Let's face it - how can she lose with that jungle-toned body, animal passion, and a fur bikini? Nevertheless, Nidalee's recent tastes in companions have been, in this writer's opinion, questionable as she has been linked to - wait for it - Journal of Justice reporter Bob Nashahago.\n\nOr how literally nothing was allowed to happen in lore, because of how big dick energy the summoners were.\n> making most wonder how such a monster could be contained. Fortunately, the power of the League's summoning has confined Cho'Gath's presence exclusively to the League of Legends. It is here that summoners use Cho'Gath's Voidborn abilities to help decide the fate of Runeterra.\n\nHow about the ever coveted old aatrox lore\n>Tales like these appear among the myths of many cultures. If they are all to be believed, Aatrox's presence has changed the course of some of the most important wars in history. Though these stories remember him as a savior in dark times, Aatrox's true legacy may be a world filled with conflict and strife.\n\nLike he just shows up and wins fights, that's his backstory, it does not go deeper than that. Why did people like this over the current version? \n\nWhat about old rammus lore and how he just kinda happened\n>The dangerous magic that dominates the Plague Lands has an effect on all life within its confines. Rammus is a living example. No one is entirely certain how an armadillo from the Shurima Desert made his way through the Kumungu Jungle - much less unharmed - but he did just that.\n\nLike new rammus lore doesn't explain either wtf he is, but they play into it. Rammus is a god, or maybe just a really jacked magic animal, who knows? HE didn't just appear one day. He has a place in the world now and belongs in it.\n\noh and heres a question. In old lore why were dangerous criminals allowed to not only be allowed in the league, but also still allowed to roam free?\n>The plans of the mastermind behind the Horseshoe Heist and Balloon Burglary - none other than Veigar, the Tiny master of Evil himself - nearly came to fruition yesterday morning in a grand attempt to abduct Bandle City's beloved Mothership. While his plans were foiled by a migrating flock of geese, Veigar managed to escape the city following his defeat. The Mothership itself was unharmed by the ordeal.\n\nVeigar is a league champion who jsut makes evil schemes, now you might say he's not a threat so the league doesnt care. Ok but Malzahar and zed and Syndra though.\n\nLike old lore was really bad, like really bad guys.","replies":[{"poster":"The Iceborn","date":"2020-01-25T15:29:58.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reviving necro- threads which already had their time to shine is against [Universal Rules](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/ITFIpNUE) and as such I will be locking this thread to make sure it lands at the bottom of the howling abyss.

Hell, the most consistently updated part of the lore was a gossip rag! If I don’t want to read about actual celebrities why would I read about the tawdry pointless lives of fake celebrities?\n\nBut I’d say there was a potential to the old lore. A potential never realized. Have you ever heard of a game called Legend of the Five Rings?  Fascinating card game from years back. In brief each year they’d play a tournament and the way the tourney played out would determine the story going forward. This got crazy at times, with one pretty major player switching his deck to a different faction and that whole thing got turned into one of the hero cards from the original deck becoming a turncoat to the new faction. And just so much more. The tourneys were then written in narrative and created a developing interesting game world. And the reason this worked was because the game’s mechanics developed the story.\n\nThe idea of a group of heroes to represent factions playing this strange game to have effect on the world is a unique one and could have been used to create an engaging experience. \n\nIt didn’t. Not at all. The closest we got was the halfassed Ionia/Noxus Thing and the battle for the crown of Freljord. Neither actually went anywhere or were given stories to show this development. They just happened and we got a shoe. No new stories or anything. I believe that dream of the game and story being linked together is part of why we have people so invested in the old lore. And hell, a few years back there was a group who did run tournaments to determine their own split off lore based upon game results. I believe the participants found it very fun.  I’m not sure whatever happened to them. \n\nBut the storytelling I outlined above takes a lot of work. Requires a very fluid understanding of story structure and requires a writer with little control on their own story. More of a grand scale D&amp;D campaign than a narrative. So it makes sense for those who don’t want to do that to scrap it and start something more manageable. Normal character driven stories completely divorced from the gameplay. Noticeably after this game and story divergence the one time they came back together was when Gangplank “died” which was a terrible idea. Instead of letting the players influence the story the story imposed restrictions on the players screwing over any Gangplank player in the process. \n\nSo yeah lot of potential little to no actual success in the telling. Instead of a player driven developing story. We got shoes and a gossip rag. \n\nSo it was replaced. But here’s the thing. I don’t think the new lore is all that good, either. Now don’t get me wrong. It’s better than the magazine. So much better than the magazine. But it’s not all that good as fantasy. The setting seems patched together, the technology and social development is inconsistent and the designs often laughable. Which admittedly the old lore had just as bad, but then it wasn’t trying to be taken seriously. So it wasn’t. \n\nThe new lore seems to strive for more complex storytelling, but I haven’t felt it. I’ve read most of what comes out and honestly I don’t know why. It isn’t particularly exciting. If I wanted good action writing I’d go reread Gemmel, or Abercrombie, or Howard. The moral complexity that gets toted on the boards seems simplistic next to Martin or Hugo. The prose is no Tolkien or Tolstoy. There doesn’t seem to be any glimpse of a deeper meaning to the stories or some grand reflection of human nature. \n\nThe new lore has never made me laugh, or cry, or scream, or give me an adrenaline rush. The characters don’t excite me, the worldbuilding seems slapdash. \n\nIt is an improvement. But it isn’t great either.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AnotherPurple379","date":"2019-03-07T22:48:01.221+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes, the old worldbuilding was terrible.

The story since the retcon does not move in the slightest, there is no kind of progression and characters don't change unless they're completely rewritten. Riot actually had regular story updates for a while before the retcon (like a full story arc about Trundle and his tribe) but they discontinued it because it wasn't very popular.","replies":[{"poster":"lowrankhero","date":"2019-03-07T22:51:00.243+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Isn't demacia in a civil war right now?","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2019-03-07T23:04:09.598+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"That's not a story, that's the start of a story.

Lissandra is only MENTIONED in #2.  So far, no mention of Gragas, Trynd, Braum, OR Anivia.  And the actual interaction between Ashe and Sej.  Oh yeah.  So awesome.\n\n{{champion:22}} Hey Sejuani, we're besties, now for no reason!\n\n{{champion:113}} Yay.  Let's braid each other's hair!\n\n{{champion:22}} We'll bake cookies!\n\n{{champion:113}}   Let's talk about boys!  Quick, pass out the food, Ashe!  They'll all love you!\n\nSeriously, Warmother sucks.  Stan Lee is rolling over in his grave.\n\nOld Lore:  Ashe and Sejuani DIDN'T KNOW EACH OTHER until the day Ashe offered her grain as a means of bringing Sejuani into the fold and saving the weak and sick of her tribe.  Sejuani BURNED the grain, declared that Winter's Claw and the Averosan were in a state of war, and that the weak must die to make way for the strong.  Ashe embodied the qualities of unity and economic justice through compassion and mercy.  Sejuani embodies tribalism, racism, and facist corporatism.  Ashe's way will take the Freljord from a backwater ripped apart by civil war to the trade center of the world; Demacia, Noxus, and Piltover will be conquered without her ever having to fire a shot, and the lives of the common/peasant/yeoman class will be improved dramatically in all four nations.  Only Sejuani stands in Ashe's way for fear of losing her own tribal identity.  There's also the possibility that Ashe's bow is from Sejuani's ancestor and not Averosa herself, and that they are distant cousins (point of fact, all European monarchs were related during medieval times) gives Sejuani a claim on the Freljord's throne which Ashe has taken.\n\n>blitz punching singed in the dick is not good interactions. Jinx and Ziggs becoming roomates after heimer throws ziggs under the bus is.\n\nAnd also, fuck the new Jinx/Heimerdinger/Ziggs dynamic.  Jinx is a terrorist and shouldn't have anything to do with Heimer and Ziggs' friendly rivalry.  Also, Ziggs and Heimer should be EQUALS; both of them distinguished academics who aren't afraid to throw down.  They even had a game-mode around this rivalry.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
