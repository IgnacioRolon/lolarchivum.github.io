The passive is a MASSIVE 0.8 ap ratio which just spells instant death if it procs. No passive in the game has this sort of crazy loaded damage, and no mage in the game has to go balls deep to wait 1.5 seconds. Not to mention, leblanc is very mana consuming, and it pretty much sends the player in a do or die situation.\n\nSince we got all of the utiliy and cannot double malice anymore and had our chains slow removed, cant we just lower the passive damage, and passive timer? We might get good balance here somewhere that will actually let her stand to use her Q to blow her cover, and do damage more reliably. I say somewhere near 1 secs and with a 0.6 ratio.\nsurely you guys can like annie ult if you have 1 second right?","replies":[{"poster":"Handy Sandy ","date":"2016-11-09T13:06:23.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is no problem with her, with {{item:3116}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3027}} (which are all core items that are basically made for her) she'll survive 1.5 seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"Catastrop","date":"2016-11-09T21:46:43.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have never seen, nor have I ever seen an LB build any of those aside from Abyssal.
