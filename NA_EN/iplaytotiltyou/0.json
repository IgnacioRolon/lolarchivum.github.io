I don&#039;t my fat fish to be a goner. {{champion:223}} \r\n\r\nAnd if this does happen, would you tweak the runes system more? Or re-balance some of the champions that have been boot of the meta?\r\n\r\nThank you for answering!

Now Stoneborn is dropping to a standard rune and we're getting Aftershock.\n\nDon't make us wait another year. Please. PLEASE, Meddler, what else do you want me to say? If you are so damn insistent that wardens and vanguards have immobilizing crowd control, give Nunu an immobilizing ability. Don't make us wait for the VGU team. You gave Draven a brand new passive after only a bit of PBE testing. The full VGU can take its time but give us a new ability to tide us over until then. There is no reason Nunu shouldn't be able to use Aftershock like all the other Vanguards and Wardens.\n\nWhat are we supposed to do, Meddler? Please, respond to this. This is not a rhetorical question, I really want to have a discussion with you about this. You've done this twice now, so surely you have an explanation for yourselves this time.\n\nYou nerfed Nunu's health scaling right before you removed Strength of the Ages, do you remember that? Literally the patch before, when no one knew you were going to remove SotA. So you nerfed his health scaling and then immediately took away 300 health after that. And gave us something we literally couldn't use. \n\nThen there was like a five month period where Nunu just flat out did not have a keystone before you reworked Bond of Stone. Those were dark times, Meddler. And now they're rearing their head again.\n\nWhat am I supposed to do? Tell me! I am **sick** and I am **tired** of playing Nunu like a juggernaut. He's not a juggernaut, Meddler! Why are you trying to force us to get Grasp of the Undying on a tank? Why are you trying to force us to look for ways to optimize in-combat sustain and damage to enemy champions on a tank, especially after the tank update where you refocused tank power into utility over damage. This is completely antithetical to everything 7.9 introduced.\n\nAnd you nerfed Nunu's base stats twice this season because of his interactions with Cinderhulk. Now Nunu is losing Stoneborn Pact, and is he going to get some compensation for that? Probably not, but even if he does it won't make up for every champion in the game having a keystone but him.
