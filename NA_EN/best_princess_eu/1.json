One, her mage update, whilst it seems small, was pretty good. Getting to move 3 spheres at any time to set up a really wide stun (which before hand would require some careful preparation) is a big buff. On top of that, she wasn't played a lot because she used to be quite buggy, which they sorted out. \n\nThere are also some champions that make people angry whenever they become prominent - one of those is Syndra. Mostly because she has a great aoe stun on top of one of the biggest single target nukes. That isn't a skill shot. I'm sure you can see how that irritates people.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Overlord Forte","date":"2016-10-26T18:33:37.829+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"This entire topic is predicated on the enemy being stunned possessing no capacity to predict, juke, or otherwise fakeout the Syndra player. Turns out if you're not moving before a gun fires, you can't dodge the bullet.\n\nSyndra's stun combo (Q+E) is mechanically slow to activate compared to some others (Morgana Q, Viktor E, and similar skillshots) because it relies on two separate abilities firing together. If sphere are already on the ground, it is at comparable speed, but relies on a physical object that must have a line draw between Syndra, her sphere, and her target.\n\nW's repositioning of spheres is a powerful mix up tool, but that too is mechanically slow. Long range W's take around a second of flight time before they can be launched for a stun, not only broadcasting position but also giving generous room to escape to a manuevering enemy. Simply running away in a straight line, often a bad idea, is perfectly feasible here because ... Syndra cannot long range snipe people with W. The skill is too slow for that, specifically. In melee combat where this combo is the strongest, however, it gives Syndra a significant secondary tool in protecting herself.\n\nI do agree the new W passive, which allows multi-sphere throws, is too powerful. It overloads her stun combo by removing the necessity of sphere management and positioning, which intrinsically slowed that combo down a fair bit. There's no way to fix that except removing multi-sphere throws as a passive, franky.\n\nOtherwise, for all useful purposes done by skilled Syndra players, her stun combos are mostly trap based. She dictates an area of control and then half relies on enemies screwing up. The other half is forcing her presence closer, which then directly allows for the first half of this equation to work. Pro-active behavior with her stun, compared to something like Morgana, is difficult to do against enemies who are prepared to deal with it.\n\nFlash comboing, and the enemy flashing to sidestep the stun, for instance, would be a near loss situation unless some other factors overrode it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bârd","date":"2016-10-26T23:18:16.879+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sorry, but that is just dumb.\n\nShe has to line you up with a sphere (significant delay), then cast the knockback (obvious cast animation).\n\nThe delay is significant enough that it is a fairly hard skillshot.\n\nYou don't need to be able to outrun a projectile to dodge it.
