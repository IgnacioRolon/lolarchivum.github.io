Lifesteal is a problem, the last thing I need is an adc's building fucking bloodthirster, death's dance, running goddamn warlord and having Aatrox give them even more lifesteal. Lifesteal needs to be toned down, not added to even more things. Not to mention, Riot hates hidden power lately, especially when it comes to passive auras: see nerfs on Janna's passive and a rework of Zilean's passive, removal of MR aura from Aegis etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Veltox","date":"2016-11-20T15:04:11.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if they give him a big cool bloody glow every time he activates lifesteal aura so everyone is aware.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tik115","date":"2016-11-20T15:20:48.322+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"What they should do is make his W interact more with his health, Aatrox is meant to jump between heal tanking and dealing damage, What I think they should do is change his W to something like this\n\nRemove the 3 hit effect on them \n\nNew Effect: Whenever Aatrox takes damage 15%(lvl1),30%(lvl6),45%(lvl11),60%(lvl16) of the damage turns into Gray health,  \n\nIf using Blood Thirst each AA heals him for 2%,4%,6%,8%,10% of gray health (Before including any Lifesteal he has built in)\n\nIf Using Blood price, Sacrifice  2%,4%,6%,8%,10% of gray health to deal X amount more damage\n\nGrey health persists until out of combat for 2 seconds in which it decays\n\nNow right of the bat this would turn him more from a fighter to a brusier however it would give the champion much more strength in general and also give players fighting as him or against him some factors to think about such as\n\nWill I be able to survive the burst to deal the damage back?\n\nShould I go all in or focus on wittling him down?\n\nShould I use Blood Price for damage or Thirst for survivability?\n\nIn addition to using the gray health mechanic it could apply to his passive as well, the % his blood well is filled means the % of the grey health he has is given back to him in addition to the base heal, What this means is if Aatrox dives into their entire team he can choose to ether try to cause havoc with Blood price or try to keep their attention with Blood thirst.","replies":[{"poster":"TheHappyReaperz","date":"2016-11-20T17:58:19.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This doesn't seem like a bad idea.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Legacy Hydralpha","date":"2016-11-20T22:09:40.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"An aura could help the archetype Aatrox should have of being this war deity kind of guy that sends his allies into a rage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2016-11-20T20:57:58.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sanji fanboy,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VfdjVzAF,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-11-20T10:38:45.476+0000)\n>\n> -fits well with his lore\n> -reduces his sustain in laning phase \n> -gives him a niche and a uniqueness unlike other drain tanks/sustain champs\n> \n> W would be a toggle spell choosing between:\n> -bonus damage (maybe make it an aura too)\n> -lifesteal Aura (isn&#x27;t increased if below 50% hp)\n\nJust give him old Sion ult.\n\n+50% attack speed.\n+50/75/100% lifesteal and you heal nearby allies for half the amount.

Make his W deal more damage but heal less overall as well (also make it so that the heal increase scales directly with his lost health instead of just suddenly increasing when you drop to 49%).
