Her ultimate, for instance, would have to get slowed down from a 9-12 second charge rate (0% cdr), to something like a 16-20 second. But this has an impact in that it takes her nearly twice as long to have a 'usable ultimate', and most everything in the game will kill her within 5 seconds. So, usability goes way down, and more emphasis is on leaning her regular Q/W/E abilities ... but they're not really made with the mind of keeping her up and going for a nearly 20 second period.\n\nPlus, there's the implication her Q's CD increases, so her overall applicable damage and sphere generation will slow as a result. This means there's more emphasis on the W to grab and position spheres ... and makes her even slower when dealing with the breakneck speed mobility that comes after her, typically. Edit: the flipside to this would be to increase the overall spheres required on the ultimate, which would keep Q static. However, that creates even more visual clutter with all her extra spheres on the field.\n\nI can keep going with theory, but the net result is that it seems to snowball into a bigger problem that wants the rest of her changed to allow it to exist. So, that's what I'm seeing, not sure if you guys are.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ofart","date":"2016-12-06T17:29:55.250+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0Qr5NaAf,comment-id=0028,timestamp=2016-12-06T08:03:31.571+0000)\n>\n> Syndra&#x27;s nerf was removed from patch 6.24 because her win rate, ban rate and pick rate all dropped more than we expected.

If anything, Syndra is stronger now than ever before because there is no Strength of the Ages to reduces her burst, Bounty Hunter and Double Edged Sword were both buffed and the Locket Aura was removed. People just don't take preseason seriously enough to play their very best champions.\n\nI want to trust Riot's balance but then you guys make ridiculous decisions like this based on meaningless samples in preseason without even intelligently factoring in context. Winrate should be a minor factor in strength evaluation unless it's for high ELO (Diamond+) and experienced players (50+ games with a champion). You're just going to see Syndra pick/ban in every LCS game again soon and in a month you'll be back to 6.18 status. \n\nIt feels like Riot just decides who they want to exist in a good state and who should be at best a barely viable punching bag. It seems like Riot is playing favorites for what styles/champions are allowed to be strong and that champions are not nerfed or buffed on merit. Then we hear talk about wanting strategic diversity and it just seems so empty. That's the definition of defining the meta and I've seen way too many situations with strong champions merely rotated out for a new set rather than objective balance with the goal of just having a fair game for everyone. \n\nReevaluating Syndra wouldn't seem so hypocritical to me if the same approach was taken with Kog but nope, he's just instantly nerfed based on a better than average preseason performance (not even anything special looking at worldwide stats. and especially considering the indirect nerfs coming in 6.24). What's next, is Ziggs going to get nerfed too because he's performing better than before even if he's still shit in Masters+ when facing actually good mids like Ahri, LB or a skilled Viktor? \n\nIt's OK though, Ziggs will continue to be unviable in competitive as long as his laning has no kill pressure and his late game scaling is below that of many other choices with kill pressure in lane, such as Cassiopeia. However, I bet if we had even one patch of Ziggs being a good pick after years of gathering dust, he'd see instant nerfs just because Riot doesn't want his type of strategy to be successful regardless of whether or not there are good answers to it. Can you honestly say that if a champion like Xerath (and he even takes more skill to use properly) had Syndra's absurd dominance at every facet of play we'd still have this discussion?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sona x Rubick","date":"2016-12-06T11:25:54.945+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0Qr5NaAf,comment-id=0028,timestamp=2016-12-06T08:03:31.571+0000)\n>\nCurrent thinking is that we can instead use that extra time to explore better changes than just a base damage nerf \n\nYes you can, and yes you should\nremove the W passive, or hell revert the mymu changes because syndra was already doing fine before the design team broke her\n\nAlso, keep in mind that now if someone's ban rate/pick rate/win rate drops before a nerf, you will be summoned","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WinTheWarOnPants","date":"2016-12-04T18:58:11.945+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"Syndra just needs to get her horrendous MYMU rework reverted.
