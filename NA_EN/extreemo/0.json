I played a lot of ARAM and never experienced this even once. I&#039;ve played some TTL and also haven&#039;t experienced this, but it was just few games per month so I can&#039;t tell.\r\n\r\nThe thing is. I figured out first issue cause - it&#039;s wallpapers which are changing in background. I have three monitors and I noticed that when my wallpaper changes - little lag spike appears in SR. I still can&#039;t figure out why my ping raising cause it&#039;s not cause of this and it&#039;s not cause of latency (game telling me that I have 60-65 ms and no FPS drop all the time). Also I noticed that a lot of people complain about same thing - they also experiencing this ping jumps for no reason. \r\n\r\nSO I would like to know if I can do something with this. I don&#039;t want to change my wallpapers shuffle off, cause it will just be stupid to turn it on-off just to play the game (although I will try if this help). But more than ever I want to get rid of this high ping jumps. It&#039;s not cause of my LAN (I checked) and not cause I&#039;m losing signal or downloading or opening browser with videos. Its happening even if I&#039;m just playing LoL SR with no other programs open.","replies":[{"poster":"eXtreemo","date":"2018-05-09T19:46:49.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay I googled a bit and found that micro stutters with wallpaper changes are caused by Nvidia video Drivers. I can't tell if I'm able to fix this myself. Cause the fix is - install some kind of intel chipset above Nvidia driver. I'm not enough competent in this question so I will be asking my friend who is.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-09T20:10:57.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have an intel CPU with an iGPU, you already have drivers for it.

I still didn't get it but thanks.\n\nAlso I found another solution to first issue: you need to turn off \"Automatically pick an accent color from background\" in personalize > colors screen. Cause stutters cause actual by this one little feature (doesn't matter how much monitors or memory or GPU you have, it will cause micro lags no matter what for some reason). \n\nFor me micro lags are gone for about 80%\n\nStill want to get rid of ping spikes in game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
