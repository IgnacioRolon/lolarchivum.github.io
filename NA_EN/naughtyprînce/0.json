This happened to me in every game now. Sorry for the label in the center. If it is not clear to see that ther is a bug, please contact me.","url":"https://youtu.be/ew7hSxQ1iZI","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ew7hSxQ1iZI/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:41}}\nWhen playing Gankplank without a skin, there will be no visible chest in the recall animation. He seems to sit on an invisible chest. Sometimes the top of the chest is still visible. This is not affecting teamfights, etc. but might be cool to see that chest again. This is easy to try it out because I tried it in many custom games and even in normals.\n\n1. Press \"B\" on any map\n2. Zoom in from every angle \n\nI checked it on every map (Summoners Rift, Crystal Scar, Twisted Treeline) and there is no difference when  going back to base and it occured every time. As i do not own any skin i couldn&#039;t check it on the others but it might be an issue there as well. \nThere is also a video attached to this discussion to show what the bug is.\n\n**Excuse me for the label in the center of the video but i wouldn't buy the full version of a program if i don't use it (test version). If it is not visible, please contact me or try it out yourself. \nTHANK YOU**\n\nHere is a picture of the actual recall animation to see the difference. I do not own this picture. www.newsoflegends.com owns this picture and I do not have any rights of it.","replies":[{"poster":"Stanceo","date":"2015-10-04T15:31:34.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This bug is still not fixed!
