Do it for a legitimate reason.","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":20,"body":"Seriously... What is wrong with this god forsaken community? Is there just a side of the community where people down vote other people just for the sake of it? At least show the courage to reply back about why you feel that you have the NEED to down vote someone. It's a shame that internet trolls exist on the internet.\r\n\r\nIt's also best if these people give their point of view or their stance on the matter being presented. It would be wise to give and show constructive criticism or to just say how you feel about he/she's comment or post. I wish there were some good Stuarts and Samaritans in this community. Apparently their isn't at all anymore...\r\n\r\nFor those who do up vote others and do give back constructive criticism and feedback, I give you a thumbs up! For those that down vote and just don't care.. I open the door for a way to improve your behavior. If you just open your heart to the matter at hand and explain what you think is better.. we can all come to an agreement on it. Otherwise, You are wasting other peoples time and fueling the fire for more: rage, hate, discontent, and over all upsetting other people in this community.\r\n\r\nThank you and have a lovely day.\r\n\r\nRifter","replies":[]}
