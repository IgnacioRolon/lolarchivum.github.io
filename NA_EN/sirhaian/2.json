Our aim is to get their FX to current League standards and improve gameplay clarity. In Patch **9.12**, we'll be releasing VFX updates for **Amumu**, **Lulu**, **Tryndamere** and **Ziggs**.\n\n*Just like the previous ones, and since these are smaller updates geared toward sprucing up some of the oldest members of the roster, they aren't in the same prioritization conversation as to how we decide who gets a VGU (where we take model, gameplay, and thematic into account too!): they do not affect any other timeline, and are more of a side project.*\n\nWe're looking for feedback on those changes, which should be up on the PBE now. Please try them out there —especially if you're a main— and leave us your feedback!\n\n-------\n\n>####{{champion:32}} **_~~AMUMU~~_**{{champion:32}} \n\n*VFX Update aimed at reinforcing his Shuriman thematic and improving his gameplay clarity. Also tried to get as close as possible to his music video’s style.*\n\nhttps://imgur.com/6jShE38\n\nhttps://youtu.be/KnNnsP7yY4M\n\n##*Kit:*\n\n* **BA** - New impacts\n* **Q** - Added a subtle effect to show the width of the missile. The tip of the missile is now brighter, too.\n* **W** - Subtle clarity change, now displaying a reflection. Better representation of the hitbox. Also has a hit effect, now.\n* **E** - New AOE, now with sand! Better representation of the hitbox. New and more condensed impact effect.\n* **R** - Entirely new AOE effect, now with actual Shuriman runes, sand and flair!\n* **P** - Just cleaned up a bit.\n\n## *Skin changes:*\n\n* **All Skins:** Cleaned up to match base.\n* **Sad Robot Amumu** received new spell effects across the board.\n\n-------\n\n>######{{champion:117}} **_~~LULU~~_**{{champion:117}} \n\n*VFX Update aimed at making her magic feel a bit more unique and improving her gameplay clarity.*\n\nhttps://imgur.com/UNcGkYj\n\nhttps://youtu.be/jSSG4qwpJ80\n\n##*Kit:*\n\n* **BA** - New missiles and hit effects.\n* **Q** - New missiles and cleaned up hit effects.\n* **W - Ally** - Improved and cleaned up buff effect.\n* **W - Enemy** - Cleaned up missile, with new hit effect.\n* **E - Ally** - Improved and cleaned up shield.\n* **E - Enemy** - Improved Pix teleport and hit effects.\n* **R** - Entirely new AOE effect. Cleaned up enemy hit effect, and new slow effect. Leaves a subtle trail of fairy dust behind.\n* **P** - Pix bolts have been cleaned up a bit, while keeping that fairy magic feel.\n\n##*Skin changes:*\n\n* **All Skins:** Cleaned up to match base.\n* **Dragon Trainer**: Pix now shoots small pink fireballs.\n\n-------\n\n>#{{champion:23}} **_~~TRYNDAMERE~~_**{{champion:23}} \n\n*Mostly a clean up to reduce all the noise from his old VFXs, while adding a little bit of Freljord flair.*\n\nhttps://imgur.com/CV5gSpj\n\nhttps://youtu.be/dwkjtcMBNEQ\n\n##*Kit:*\n\n* **BA** - New hit effects and adjusted weapon trails.\n* **Q** - More visible heal effect with reduced noise.\n* **W** - Added a cast effect that shows the range of the ability.\n* **E** - New effect, showing the actual width of the AOE (yes, his weapon is bigger than the AOE size).\n* **R** - New activation effect and buff.\n* **P** - New rage indicator effect.\n\n## *Skin changes:*\n\n* **All Skins:** Cleaned up to match base.\n* **Demonblade**: New fiery spell effects.\n\n-------\n\n>##{{champion:115}} **_~~ZIGGS~~_**{{champion:115}} \n\n*Complete VFX overhaul, focused on showing the actual size of his AOEs and bringing him up to today’s quality standards.*\n\nhttps://imgur.com/mka8NM7\n\nhttps://youtu.be/86B2PQFn0PM\n\n##*Kit:*\n\n* **BA** - New missiles and impacts. Sparks!\n* **Q** - New missile, but especially new explosion, leaving a crater that shows the AOE size. Sparks too!\n* **W** - New explosion, with crater. Has an upward movement to reinforce the knock-up feel. Now has a hit effect. Adjusted AOE indicators to match the hitbox. Also sparks!\n* **E** - Added a subtle trail to the missiles. Added a subtle range indicator on the mines. They also leave a small crater on impact. More sparks!\n* **R** - New cast, indicators, missile, AOE and hit effect. Finally an actual mushroom cloud! And guess what? Yes, sparks!\n* **P** - Empowered hit is more explodey and the missile has more sparks!\n* ** Emotes** - Changed the various explosions to look closer to the rest of his kit.\n\n##*Skin changes:*\n\n* **Mad Scientist**: Added bubbles and goo here and there. Green explodey stuff!\n* **Pool Party**: Cleaned up the noise and brought him closer to the rest of the skin line.\n* **Snow Day**: Cleaned up the noise and added some warmer accents in the missiles and explosions.\n* **Arcanist**: Added the crater in the ult and updated the indicator to match base.\n* **Odyssey**: Added the crater in the ult.\n\n-------\n\nPlease test those changes on the PBE and let us know if you have any feedback!\n\n\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Kadexe","date":"2019-05-29T19:52:50.845+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really nice stuff, especially clarity on Tryndamere's ult.","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2019-05-30T05:00:10.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"His winrate will probably go down because of this.","replies":[{"poster":"Kaduva","date":"2019-05-30T08:49:23.461+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SpecterVonBaren,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=cRIFiyaO,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2019-05-30T05:00:10.583+0000)\n>\n> His winrate will probably go down because of this.\n\nno... it wont... unless they're blind, deaf and have no sense of time cuz most people know trynd has an r and approximately how long it lasts even if not exactly how long and if your partially blind there is an audio cue.

But because i really like it and yet it feels off at the same time, i've just spent 10 minutes playing current ziggs ult over and over and comparing it to this new ziggs ult over and over and then i went into pbe to see if the case was different in game because despite loving how it looks it **feels** much less explosive. And indeed it was a case that the videos in isolation made it feel worse than it is.\n\nAfter playing frame by frame several times and throwing a LOT of ults in practice tool i came to several personal conclusions;\n\n1. The first few frames of explosion are quieter in terms of visuals than live, the effect itself comes off the ground into a sphere and yet it's smaller than the current iteration. Where the ground is replaced by a huge flash of white for a few a frames, if this was changed to allow for visual clarity i understand, but i'd like to see the explosion create a floor of white fire.\n\n2. There is a subtle distortion effect ala Garen ult that ripples outwards in a shockwave effect which shows dissipation of energy into the surrounding area, i'm really happy with that.\n\n3. The sound is far less fiery now, the explosion lacks the same fire crackle and accompanying flames, not sure if this is intended though as it seems there is an overall reduction in the fireball created by the explosion, i assume the direction it was taken in is to be more atomic in nature?\n\n4. The isolated audio of the explosion feels ... Flat(?) As if a cannon ball has landed with a thud and then explodes outward in a flat direction afterwards. This is not the case with current ziggs as the bomb lands and explodes with a more spherical sound which feel like it's going upwards and outwards.\n\n5. The mushroom cloud and fireball are quite small in the newer versions, In terms of art it's great but now the visual effect reaches less height it appears to lack the same energy.\n\nSo yeah it's all nitpick stuff and i do believe the vfx update is great but if there was space for anything else to come forward without impacting gameplay. it would help in the ult feeling a little more visceral {{sticker:sg-kiko}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellsing69","date":"2019-05-31T17:21:31.429+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really dont like the new ultimate.

So pretty. Might play her. \n\n{{champion:32}} However I do play Amumu and his ult made me sad instantly when I saw it. Like others have said it looks a little empty. I understand this could be to reduce visual clutter? \nThe small glyphs around the edges are probably why. They probably aren't large enough considering how team powerful this ultimate is. E.g. bard with his ult, braum with his ult. Difference is I suppose they're designed to be dodged. \n \nI wonder if it would improve with a champion update overall. I like the idea of the runes appearing first before lighting up/bursting and then his ult occurring. Kind of \"un wrapping\" or \"unravelling\" around. Like a blooming lone oasis lotus. Poor Amumu :( \n\nBut my base suggestions are larger glyphs and maybe should keep the coloured circle beneath, even if it's just a faint magic/sand storm haze. As if they got caught in the desert by a lone wandering Amumu and stuck in sandstorm. \n\n I think Shurima has poor visual effects compared to Targon, Void and the Cursed Isles which is making it difficult. I remember seeing the colour/effect comparison for themes and do not remember Shurima. Perhaps it isn't really living (undying?) up to its high fantasy Egyptian Empire theme.

The ultimate especially makes him look untargetable for a moment.\n* Ult fades visually in the center before the root fades, which could be confusing. I might keep it brighter for longer.\n* Passive is fairly boring compared to his other effects. Can this get a bit more punch?\n* Slight concerned that W doesn't give its range as clearly as it could, and it might be nice to see Tantram have a few more of the burst-style bright effects from his ultimate so they don't come out of the blue there.\n* Would be nice if the ult runes came out a little faster so they were clearer for longer.\n\n-----------------------------\n\n##Lulu\n\n* Absolutely glorious.\n* Only comment is that I'm not sure the shield even needs the leaves any longer, but that's not a dealbreaker in general.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n##Tryndamere\n\n* Love the new hit effect.\n* Green healing lines look weird on a barbarian, but green is consistently healing, so I'll survive.\n* The mocking shout looks great, but makes me realize how much I dislike his weird little blade movement (since the effect doesn't deal damage) and the fact that he *does not shout anything*.\n* Spin looks *incredible*.\n* Ult looks...almost *too* fiery. I miss seeing Tryndamere a bit, and I'm not sure why it has that little burst of frost. I understand he's from Freljord, but it seems a bit arbitrary.\n* Concerned there's too much color going on here. We have green, orange, yellow, white, dark red, and dark browns, along with the blue tinges to W and R's burst. I feel reducing this palette might be helpful in making him feel a bit more visually tight.\n* \"Freljord flair\" isn't selling well. Tryndamere -- while he is from the Freljord -- it not especially magical, does not possess ice powers, and is basically just a powerful tribal leader. The ice effects, as a result, feel rather forced and nonsensical, unless you turned that into a common theme and used it on, say, slowed targets, as his healing burst color, etc.\n\n-----------------------------\n\n##Ziggs\n\n* Feels *much* more explosive. Nice job.\n* Ziggs ult is nice and satisfying, but I worry the bomb itself isn't as visible as it could be.
