In Patch 8.24, we&#039;ll be releasing VFX and SFX updates for Anivia, Dr. Mundo and Renekton, and VFX-only updates for Gragas (he already received some SFX love) and Teemo. Please try them out on the PBE&mdash;especially if you&#039;re a main&mdash;when they&#039;re in and leave us your feedback here!\n\nToday&#039;s preview covers the visual effects updates to **Teemo, the Swift Scout**. (He has not received any sound updates.)\n\n##VFX\n###VFX update across the board to clean up unnecessary noise and improve gameplay clarity.\n**BA** - New missile and hit impact.\n**Q** - Missile is now much more different from the BA and clearly identifiable. Impact is also more satisfying.\n**W** - Added some love to the VFX, making it feel more satisfying, with some added leaves and dust.\n**E** - Missile is now clearly visible and identifiable.\n**R** - Now has an actual explosion that shows the actual AOE range. Yes, it is that big.\n\nAll of Teemo&#039;s skins have had their VFX updated, with unique shroom explosions where it made sense.\n**Astronaut Teemo** should now feel like an actual 1350.\n**Cottontail Teemo** received some extra love.\n\n_Base Teemo (and skins using his base effects)_\nhttps://imgur.com/xd6LjfC\n\n_Astronaut Teemo_\nhttps://imgur.com/upxmYMq\n\n_Cottontail Teemo_\nhttps://imgur.com/nhCxnm4\n\n_Super Teemo and Panda Teemo&#039;s shroom explosions_\nhttps://imgur.com/aRlaPtA\n\nVideo of all the changes:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqjHnCyealM\n\n\n**Please use this thread to give feedback on Teemo&#039;s VFX.

I feel like that should be made consistent across skins as either a color change or NOT a color change -- currently all the other skins seem to shift slightly orange, which I might recommend here. Astronaut Teemo Q also *sounds* very much like the empowered auto-attack, so I'd look to differentiate those a bit more -- this is somewhat the case in all the skins, but most pronounced here.\n\nOtherwise, fantastic job as usual!

I think that all the changes to his visual are fantastic. My only complaint is, if Teemo's visuals are being updated, this would seem like the perfect opportunity to change Happy Elf Teemo's mushrooms into presents. Personally I've always thought it was one of the largest waste of opportunities and have always hoped that the skin would receive this change.

It feels really bad it never applies to that first auto attack (melee or ranged) an enemy sends out after the dart hits. It feels like there's a small delay from when the dart hits and when it takes effect. I think it has to do with when the animation of the opponents attack starts also being the point it checks for blind and the difference between the attack starting and sending can have it line up so that even though they got hit by the dart and should be blinded they weren't were the attack started.
