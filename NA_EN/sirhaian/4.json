In Patch 8.24, we'll be releasing VFX and SFX updates for Anivia, Dr. Mundo and Renekton, and VFX-only updates for Gragas _(he already received some SFX love)_ and Teemo. Keep an eye on this post and we'll add visual previews as they become ready! Please try them out on the PBE—especially if you're a main—when they're in and leave us your feedback here!\n\nStarting off with our first preview...\n\n# {{champion:36}} Dr. Mundo\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/hYsuomu\n\n##VFX\n###_VFX update across the board to clean up unnecessary noise and improve gameplay clarity._\n**BA** - New trails and impacts for more satisfaction.\n**Q** - Now clearer, with a subtle trail to make it more easily readable. Cleaver also now stays stuck in the target for a short time, for maximum satisfaction!\n**W** - Now properly shows the range of the AOE, while feeling more threatening. Targets are also briefly _visually_ put on fire when damaged.\n**E** - New buff effect on his wrists makes it easier to identify when it's active.\n**R** - Bigger initial burst and overall clearer effect makes it actually look like a heal, and is now much easier to see in a Teamfight. Or a tower-dive.\n\n##SFX\n###_SFX update across the board to clean up unnecessary noise and added higher definition sounds._\n**BA** - Clearer SFX on the hit of the attack.\n**Q** - Clearer SFX on when the cleaver is thrown and hits.\n**W** - Activation audio is clearer.\n**E** - Added Zaun elements into the audio.\n**R** - Added Zaun elements into the audio.\n\nAnd here's the video for Mundo:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KRoF1Z_tYM\n\nAnd an update to his Q sounds:\nhttps://youtu.be/cHnAFhKfObI\n\nAll Mundo skins that previously used base VFXs have been updated to use the new ones, with subtle changes where it makes sense.\n\n# {{champion:79}} Gragas\n\nRead more here: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/pjKXqRsl-visual-and-sound-effect-updates-gragas\n\n\n# {{champion:17}} Teemo\n\nRead more here: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/UfFT2huQ-visual-effects-update-teemo\n\nWe'll be showing previews of the other champions in the near future, so keep your eyes peeled!","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-10-31T00:13:48.020+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"Mundo changes look great, although the cleaver being so green and not having a huge meaty impact effect is a bit odd to me.

I inquired with the team who originally worked on him, and they said he was given Pool Party's ult because Base ult was so noisy, but the nuts and bolts were removed after it went to PBE, because the team felt they didn't really make sense as he's a toy and not a robot.\nBecause I've now fixed the noisiness of base, I'm reverting him to using base VFX.\nOnce I post my preview, please let me know how it feels. If it's feels bad, I will take a look and see what we can do for Renektoy's Ult.

For one thing, I  love the overall changes made. His kit definitely lacked audio quality (especially for standards now), but I have a few points of criticism.\n\nQ - Infected Cleaver\nI like the new model, animation, and sound, but I think the coloring is a little too green to match his personality, character, lore, etc. His current Q is a decent mix between red and brown, and while I appreciate giving the Q some green to match the name and overall idea of the ability, I feel like it's a little overbearing. How am I supposed to play as a lollipop loving murderer without the murder?\n\nW - Burning Agony\nThis and Masochism (well get to that later) were easily the most deserving of SFX and VFX overhauls, and for the most part, I feel this one doesn't have too much wrong with it. I love the cinders, detailed flame, and other fine parts of the animation, but I feel the sound is a little misleading. The activation is perfect; the player and enemy should have a clear, roaring indication of {{champion:36}} Mundo's \"burning agony\" coming about. However, the persistent sound is where my complaint lies. Because the ability is a simple AP per second, I don't think it should reminisce of burn champions like {{champion:90}} Malzahar or {{champion:63}} Brand by being so loud or... is demanding a word that works here?\n\nE - Masochism\nI..... I don't even know what to say. I'm not sure what yellow visuals have to do with {{champion:36}} Mundo's kit. I think it'd look nice if it was a {{item:3742}} Deadman's Plate type of animation/color.\n\nR - Sadism\nHonestly I've got no ill will towards this one.
