{"poster":"Sirhaian","date":"2019-04-16T20:40:35.852+0000","title":"VFX Updates for Ashe, Blitzcrank, Caitlyn and Jax, plus an SFX Update for Renekton.","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello everyone!\n\nSimilar to the previous VFX updates we’ve made in the past (*Kennen, Olaf, Wukong, etc*), we're working on updates to the Visual Effects (VFX) of more champions whose spell effects are in need of some love. Our aim is to get their FX to current League standards and improve gameplay clarity. In Patch **9.9**, we'll be releasing VFX updates for **Ashe**, **Blitzcrank**, **Caitlyn** and **Jax**, and an **SFX** update for **Renekton**.\n\nWe're looking for feedback on those changes, which should be up on the PBE now. Please try them out there —especially if you're a main— and leave us your feedback!\n\n\n-------\n\n\n\n{{champion:22}} **Ashe** \n*VFX update across the board to clean up unnecessary noise and improve gameplay clarity. Ashe wasn’t in such a high risk area, so we just brought up the art aesthetic to keep her more in line with our Freljordian champions.*\n\nhttps://imgur.com/cF3Simo\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3KUbD23RXk\n\n**BA** - Basic attacks are now frosty with an updated arrow model\n**Q** - Mostly added more glow and frost\n**W** - Cleaned up unnecessary noise and created a sharper projectile\n**E** - She now fires an icy hawk that explodes into snow on impact. Updated model for the hawk!\n**R** - New arrow model and made it feel more threatening and cold. Should now slightly indicate the hitbox more clearly.\n**P** - Frosty and cool\n\n*Please note that all skins will not be touched, except for the ones that use base VFX for their respective recolors on live.*\n\n-------\n\n{{champion:53}} **Blitzcrank**\n*VFX update across the board to clean up unnecessary noise and improve gameplay clarity. Keep in mind he is also getting a small gameplay update!*\n\nhttps://imgur.com/JzI0mxn\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUAEVbPN2II\n\n**BA** - New hit effects.\n**Q** - Blitzcrank’s Q has been updated to (finally) show the actual width and distance of the hook. Should now be more consistent with the hitbox. Also cleaned up a bit and added a small cast effect.\n**W** - Cleaned up, with added electricity.\n**E** - Cleaned up, with added electricity on his fists. New uppercut hit effect.\n**R** - Finally shows the actual range! Yes, it’s always been this big. Should also be more satisfying. The R ready indicator (the body electricity) has also been cleaned up.\n**P** - The barrier has been cleaned up a bit.\n\n*Skins:*\n**Rusty Blitzcrank**: Rustier.\n**Piltover Customs Blitzcrank**: Cleaned up and recolored W effects.\n**iBlitzcrank**: Cleaned up his Q and added jetpacks in his W run. Preserved the lens flares in his E.\n**Riot Blitzcrank**: R has a hint of red.\n**Battle Boss Blitzcrank**: Improved R satisfaction and adjusted the R AOE size.\n**Lancer Rogue Blitzcrank**: Cleaned up R noise.\n**Lancer Paragon Blitzcrank**: Cleaned up R noise.\n\n-------\n\n{{champion:51}} **Caitlyn**\n*VFX update across the board to clean up unnecessary noise and improve gameplay clarity. Also reinforced her Piltover/Hextech thematic where it made sense, while trying to preserve her iconic feel. Should feel more impactful and on-par with our modern standards.*\n\nhttps://imgur.com/dsIsTzi\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqRi-a9Y8c4\n\n**BA** - Cleaned up and removed all the noise. Also new hit impacts.\n**Q** - Cleaned up and removed the noise. Also added a width indicator on both Q1 and Q2 for clarity. New hit impacts.\n**W** - Reduced activation noise. Cleaned up the root effect. Ally traps now glow blue instead of green to match our modern standards.\n**E** - Cleaned up, and now more accurately represent the width of the missile.\n**R** - Reduced the R target effect’s noise and improved timing a bit. Also new cast effect, missile and hit effect.\n**P** - New headshot missile and effects. Should be more readable and satisfying!\n\n*Skins:*\n**Headhunter Caitlyn**: Cleaned up the projectiles. Added the width indicator on Q1 and Q2.\n**Lunar Wraith Caitlyn**: Cleaned up the projectiles. Adjusted width of Q missiles to match base. Also cleaned up R charging and hit effects.\n\n-------\n\n{{champion:24}} **Jax**\n*VFX update across the board to clean up unnecessary noise and improve gameplay clarity. Made his attacks sharper and more impactful.*\n\nhttps://imgur.com/kquOJQB\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtB5SDkVmFE\n\n**BA** - Cleaned up and more impactful\n**Q** - Cleaned up and a bit more readable\n**W** - Activation more visible, and added fire to the lamp post. Bigger impact, too.\n**E** - Cleaned up, and now shows the range of the stun!\n**R** - Cleaned up and more visible, with some sand particles!\n**R P** - Third hit now much more clear and satisfying.\n\n*Skins:*\n**Nemesis Jax**: New particles over the entire kit, to give it some more uniqueness.\n**God Staff Jax**: Added the stun range indicator on his E to match the changes on base.\n\n-------\n\n{{champion:58}} **Renekton**\n*Cleaning up Renekton's Audio to make it more clear! Goal is to EQ original files to clean out unneeded noise. **SFX Updates only**, as he already received some VFX Updates earlier.*\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_TfmVVVFxc\n\n**Q** - Emphasizing the Blade on the Cast as well as the Hit\n**W** - Cleaning up loops with EQ, adding blade textures to Execute and Super Execute\n**E** - Slice and Dice has applied Tremolo in the cast, more Transient to the Hit\n**R** - Debris in the Loops have more debris texture with EQ as well. The Cast has more texture to represent some faction tonality\n**P** - EQ present on the Cast and cleaner growl.\n\n-------\n\nPlease test those changes on the PBE and let us know if you have any feedback!\n\n\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Sanguiphilia","date":"2019-04-16T21:06:06.940+0000","up_votes":59,"down_votes":9,"body":"Caitlyn's abilities look far too magic-y now.

Though, since Ashe's ult stun grows stronger with distance traveled, would it be possible to have the VFX grow stronger the longer it's in flight, capping off at the distance of the max stun value (similar to Jinx's rocket VFX changing when it speeds up)? Maybe lessen the current (updated) VFX at the start, and make it enhance slightly every time the stun grows stronger. Or just make the arrow spin more? Though that might make it read differently lol\n\nAlthough, the stun value does grow in very small intervals (every 200 units traveled, up to 2800 if the wiki's correct), and making this kind of change would take quite a bit more work (not only from a coding side, but you would also need to update the VFX of all the skins that change them as well to keep consistency).

Rn, you are actively hindered by taking the skin, as the animation is much easier to cancel then any other E or basic attack animation due to the wind up, and I feel looking into see if it can be better optimized would make the skin feel so much worse to play then the others.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dochasach","date":"2019-04-22T20:25:17.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Below I have listed my thoughts on each Ashe skin regarding her VFX update.**\n_**Please note that all of the comments below are my own personnel opinion and something I would personally like to see.**_\n\n**Freljord Ashe**\nFor a 520RP skin, the VFX are fine.\n\n**Sherwood Forest Ashe**\nOnce again, for it being a 520RP the VFX are fine\n* Personnel note, there is a tiny hint of a teal colour in her W and E. Wish it could carry over to the rest of her abilities, but it is 520RP so it isn't that big of a deal\n\n**Woad Ashe**\nSame thing as **Sherwood Forest Ashe** :)\n\n**Queen Ashe**\nThis skin is 975RP (As well as Legacy) and personally I would have liked to see more changed to the VFX, colour wise. Maybe more of a white colour on all of her abilities with a slight gold accent (As her dress has gold on it).\n\n**Amethyst Ashe**\nFor a 975RP skin I really like it, even if it just the base VFX with a purple colour! :3\n\n**Marauder Ashe**\nWith this being a 750RP skin I can say that nothing needs to change really. I think it is fine as it is. :)\n\nFor **Heartseeker Ashe**, **PROJECT: Ashe**, **Championship Ashe**, and **Cosmic Queen Ashe** no changes were made (Except for her Q) so I have no comments about these skins. :)\n\nTo see a comparison of Ashe's Old and New VFX watch the video below! | Video By: [SQUPO](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsddb9Ln5cI-04Hkja9srtw/featured)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoh2vaYw0z4\n\nIf you have any questions or your own opinions then leave me a message and I will be glad to respond!\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} \n\n\nOriginal Post: https://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/client-new-features-feedback/EEJ79rZm-thoughts-on-ashe-vfx-update","replies":[]}]}
