Our aim is to get their FX to current League standards and improve gameplay clarity. In Patch **10.1**, we'll be releasing a VFX Update for Thresh!\n\n*Just like the previous ones, and since these are smaller updates geared toward sprucing up some of the oldest members of the roster, they aren't in the same prioritization conversation as to how we decide who gets a VGU (where we take model, gameplay, and thematic into account too!): they do not affect any other timeline, and are simply dev passion projects.*\n\nWe're looking for feedback on his VFX changes, which should be up on the PBE soon-ish. Please try him out there —especially if you're a main— and leave us your feedback once the changes are up!\n\n-------\n\n>####{{champion:412}} **_~~THRESH~~_**{{champion:412}}\n\n*VFX Update aimed at improving gameplay readability and bringing up his VFXs to today's standards, while improving his thematic feel.*\n\nhttps://imgur.com/TxtmdZc\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hS3Oz7ZUj4\n\n##*Base Kit:*\n\n* **P** - New souls and power-up effects.\n* **BA** - Trails on all skins, and new hit effects.\n* **Q** - Made the hitbox clearer and adjusted hook position. New hit effects. New link break effect (ie. on cleanse/qss). New wind-up effect.\n* **W** - New Lantern missile and AOE indicator. Should be more noticeable and in-thematic. New edge indicator. Cleaned up ray of light towards Thresh. Lantern now rotates much more fluidly (no more chunky rotations, except if you're super close to it). Cleaned up overall.\n* **E** - Added a circle indicator to show the *actual* hitbox. **Yes, there was a circle hitbox around it.** Why? How would I know. At least now it's clearly indicated. Also new indicator overall with improved thematic feel.\n* **R** - Thematic feel improvement, and cleaned up. I kept the original pillars.\n\n\n* **Idle Effects** - Cleaned up and improved idle effects overall to match his actual appearance (read \"match the Senna cinematic\").\n\n\nE comparison:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/nGnRhdl\n\n\n-------\n\n\n## *Skin changes:*\n\n* **All Skins:** Cleaned up and matched base changes.\n* **Deep Terror Thresh:** Cleaned up overall, and more bubbles.\n* **Championship Thresh:** New Championship particles overall, and some cleanup.\n* **Blood Moon Thresh:** Mostly just a cleanup with some thematic improvements.\n* **Dark Star Thresh:** Mostly just some tweaks to match base.\n* **High Noon Thresh:** Mostly just some tweaks to match base.\n\n\n-------\n\n##***Known things to add/fix:***\n\n- Add BA Trails on Dark Star.\n- Add E circle indicators on Pulsefire Thresh.\n- W Lantern fire position is off on High Noon Thresh.\n\n\n-------\n\n\nPlease test those changes on the PBE once he's up (should be some time next week) and let us know if you have any feedback!\n\n\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"DerMangoJoghurt","date":"2019-12-13T20:38:56.994+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"WHAT DO YOU MEAN THERE IS A CIRCLE HITBOX DURING HIS E?\n# WHAT?\n\n###### Visual effects look great btw.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonPup","date":"2019-12-13T20:48:38.542+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some nice subtle improvements go a long way towards helping him feel more ghostly.

The effort you've expended in designing these updates overall is quite readily apparent, and while it isn't my intent to undercut your hard work, I'd like to try to communicate with some seriousness and insistence that what you've done to the hook graphic dramatically changes the emotional dynamic unique to the game feel of each skin. After thousands of hours of playing Thresh, I can tell you that throwing a Championship hook feels distinctly different from throwing a Blood Moon hook, for instance, due to the shape and character of the projectile as it travels across the screen; a rounded sickle embodies a clean, industrially streamlined sort of feel that corresponds to the Championship aesthetic, while Blood Moon's sharp and harshly-angled blade evokes a ninja or assassin-like feeling. Standardizing the graphic across every skin genuinely compromises the thematic integrity of each, in my view, and I'd urge you to consider finding some other way to accomplish the goal of visually concentrating the spell's focal point of attention than by drowning it in particles and erasing its unique character. This is especially noticeable with Dark Star's hook, which originally looked more like a wad of energy and is now just. . . pink.\n\nThanks for taking the time to consider my input.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rowanstar","date":"2020-01-09T00:04:34.949+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My main issue is the glowing fire from his tendrils on the head is gone and it just looks weak without it. like even a soft glow would be nice. why was this removed at all? even his splash has the glow.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RaedXray","date":"2019-12-16T19:13:51.195+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love this update to his animations and the color changes to his model, I always thought Thresh looked weird and unfitting of his lore and scary thematic without the shadowy outlines he has here. \n\nBut this got me thinking, will there be a similar update to Nautilus?

He's never even really depicted with all these particles around it and instead it's just green with at most a slight aura to it.\nThis isn't really as bad with like dark star, high noon, and to an extent championship. If you really wanted to make the Q more noticeable just keep the particles to the head rather than plenty on the head and plenty on the chain too.\n-E\nThe random stuff on the side and the needless amount of particles just make it look like a mess. There was never even a problem with the hitbox being visible like with Q to even properly justify the stuff on the side showing the direct it's going in or the bright colors to show it's there. And if you want to go further you can compare it to the newest champ, Sett, and how his E is pretty similar to Thresh's E and even less visible.\n\n\n\nOverall:\nThe good stuff is good but is drowned out by all the bad and this whole VFX update just brings to light how sometimes things are shown as \"improvements\" by plastering a bunch of particles on them. Please if you go forward with these lessen them a lot and keep this update in effects more faithful to what it was before.

I don't know if you already thought about reworking Twisted Fate's basic attack at higher speeds but I just wanna give you an idea (because I would love if it got into the game).\n The idea is that when {{champion:4}}  reaches around 2.00 or 2.10 attack speed then he changes from single hand throws to throwing with both hands (not at the same time) while spinning or doing some fancy card throw move. \nThis could also be applied only to his \"Tango\" skin because he's a dancer there. I thought of this a while back but now I really felt excited about telling you about my idea. In any case I really hope that you take look at this idea and I would also love a reply or a notification ;D\nI posted a discussion at the gameplay board about this and now I found this!\n\nSincerely\nA player who Loves League Of Legends","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mudkas Meat Hut","date":"2020-01-18T22:52:24.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you! love seeing improvements across the game that don't require new purchases. great work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShadowSamurai8","date":"2019-12-19T08:53:56.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can Darkstar and High Noon get Autoattack Trails too?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Soossi","date":"2019-12-17T09:11:19.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was wondering if Thresh's W could get more souls spinning around the lantern as he gets more stacks?
