Our aim is to get their FX to current League standards and improve gameplay clarity. In Patch **9.24**, we'll be releasing a VFX Update for Lux!\n\n*Just like the previous ones, and since these are smaller updates geared toward sprucing up some of the oldest members of the roster, they aren't in the same prioritization conversation as to how we decide who gets a VGU (where we take model, gameplay, and thematic into account too!): they do not affect any other timeline, and are simply dev passion projects.*\n\nWe're looking for feedback on her changes, which should be up on the PBE soon. Please try her out there —especially if you're a main— and leave us your feedback once the changes are up!\n\n-------\n\n>####{{champion:99}} **_~~LUX~~_**{{champion:99}} \n\n*VFX Update aimed at improving gameplay readability and bringing up her VFXs to today's standards. Also, more rainbows.*\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/5GhCK6k.png\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7MWo_ukVSY\n\n##*Base Kit:*\n\n* **BA** - Cleaned up missile and impact.\n* **Q** - Added a subtle effect to show the width of the missile. Also more sparkly and rainbowy!\n* **W** - Mostly just a clean-up. Added a subtle missile width indicator on missile going out.\n* **E** - Revamped and cleaned up charge and explosion effects. Missile still similar.\n* **R** - Effect has been completely overhauled. Now has indicator lines on both sides to show the actual width of the beam. Also has a line at the end to show the actual range of it (it was kind of really off before, ahem).\n* **P** - Just cleaned up a bit.\n\n* **Idle Effects** - Cleaned up and improved idle staff effects.\n\n## *Skin changes:*\n\n* **All Skins:** Cleaned up and matched base.\n* **Steel Legion Lux:** Cleaned up lightning effects on Q missile, E explosion and R beam.\n\n*All the most recent skins changes are very minor.*\n-------\n\nPlease test those changes on the PBE once she's up and let us know if you have any feedback!\n\n\n**EDIT**: Some Changes I've done since I posted this originally:\n\n\n- Reduced some of the pinks overall\n- Narrowed her auto attack missiles\n- Reduced Base Q brightness slightly\n- Added a trail to Base Q\n- Added sparks on Q width indicator to make it a bit clearer\n- Base W missile orbs are now pale orange like the rest of her kit\n- Adjusted Base E explosion color\n- Base R Red beam is now more red\n- Added slightly more oomph to her Base R beam\n- Did a value pass on all skins for her R\n- Added a scorch mark on all her skins after R has fired\n- R cleanup (too many lines)\n- Changed the R indicators to match skin color where appropriate\n- Adjusted her Quick Cast indicators to actually (and finally) match the range and width of her abilities\n\n\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"EstrellitaKiut","date":"2019-11-27T03:48:27.330+0000","up_votes":57,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hello, I am a Lux{{champion:99}} otp with 2 million points on the Euw server that has been playing since the end of season 3, and seeing this makes me very happy because it is a love for the base of the skin of Lux and Steel Legion, so first of all I wanted to thank you for this❤\nMaking a review of the new visual effects:\n\nBA - It has a cleaner and more colorful effect, and the effect is luminous, I definitely love it ❤ But about the impact of the basic attack on the enemy looks smaller and weak than the older, so I think it would be still better if you combine both impacts effects: the old version with the new one that you did❤\n\nScore 8/10\n\nQ - It has new visual effects that flash with beauty, small colored sprinkles jump in the light, and it all looks very Disney. I have seen it in slow motion and I have noticed that it illuminates with different spectra of the rainbow during the different points of his trajectory ❤\n\nScore 10/10\n\nW - The shield feels more refined with cleanliness, and the lux particles sprout in a more magical way when you throw the shield, it is beautiful, but being honest I don't like that the shield then shines yellow / gold, because in essence the light of lux is white, and yellow does not generate that same feeling of \"rainbow\" as the color white, because it is the combination of all the spectra that make up and generates a rainbow, so I would love that the light that wraps around Luxanna's shield remain white-rainbow please\n\nScore 4/10\n\nE - I really love this renovation, it is beautiful how the projectile emanates a lot of light when it is positioned in a place, Lucent Singularity looks like a star of light that sends successive waves of light and power in the position in which it is located. a great effect, I also love the explosion, it is very beautiful, but I think I would like it better if the explosion were a little more rainbow instead of that pink, and I love pink, but the essence of Lux is in the Rainbow, pink, is already characteristic of other skins, as Sexy Jack Rabbit (OCE) had said\n\nScore 9/10\n\nR -  What I mainly notice is that the Lux beam has always been so flat, a 2D ray, and the truth was already obsolete compared to the 3D effect of her new skill, as well as the one shown in comic book deliveries from Lux, where she and Sylas launch a powerful white rainbow beam of 3D light several times\n\nOn the one hand, I loved that I changed from 2D to 3D. But with respect to colors, I have the feeling that it is less \"rainbow\" because it looks very yellow / golden, just like the shield, and the essence of pure light is white, therefore, the white light is divided into the successive colors of rainbow. The R of the base lux has always been white for that reason, and that white light always next to the other colors has made it seem very \"rainbow\", in fact, Lux has special interactions talking near the rainbow, it's something characteristic of the champion That is why that golden glow looks like a wonderful woman or a carnival, doesn't look so powerful like the original in the effect, and I feel that it does not combine well with her essence and I would like it to be white-rainbow instead of yellow /gold, respecting its true nature. In addition, in the current Lux R you can see all the colors of the rainbow, in this, I have seen the animation in slow motion and the ray has frames where it looks blue-gold-red, blue-white-yellow, and even frames where the beam looks dark gray or gold or 100% yellow\nIn fact, in the mentioned deliveries of this year with the comics of Lux, the ray looks white with rainbow tones, it is something that when seeing it with the gold / yellow does not combine too much\n\nScore 2/10\n\nIt seems that the effect of the Lux burn from the base of the skin has been eliminated when it hits the enemies with the ultimate ability, please I pray for being returned, and also the effect of the \"heat wave\" after having launched the R once finalized, which can currently be seen in the last current base lux after the end of the cast of R. These effects can be clearly seen in the video of the R of Lux in the launcher, in the collection.\n\nI love that the staff is illuminated all the time, it shows that she is the bearer of the light &lt;3 And I love how everything illuminates during the cast of the R, very nice 10/10\n\nRegarding Steel Legion's skin, I liked it almost completely, except for the shield that retains exactly the same skin base with that golden color that combines nothing (3/10)\n\nIn addition the effect of the E that is the same also of the base of the skin, except when it explodes, (5/10) I think that to correct the E it is necessary to give a more electric or sparkling effect to the particles of light when the Lucent Singularity is in position (not exploding yet).\n\nThe Q with those blue electric effects, reminds quite a bit of the elementalist form of the ray for being very similar and I suggest transforming the electric of the blue color with rainbow colors so that it is not blue (3/10). Finally I think the effect of the true rainbow of the ulti is beautiful, although I also miss the electrifying essence of the previous one. To value the R of the new Legion of steel seems complicated to me, because on the one hand I like the idea of making it a true more \"alive\" and magical because of the colors that preserve the base of the skin, but at the same time I miss the so electrifying effect of the previous one, I think I would rate it as (7/10), and I think that to improve it it could be great to create a thunder - rainbow, in which the ray instead of shining with a blue color, let it shine with all the colors of the rainbow, how I would love it❤\n\nRegarding the indicators of where the R goes, I support you, because I know that this is not a mistake or a failure, it is a visual effect that is generated from the perspective of the game camera, so I think is normal that you can not always see the two delimiting lines from where the beam passes, since it depends on the angle from which it is launched and the direction-destination to which you want to reach. The Q and the basics have enamored me as you have done them, and I would ask you to leave them like that, it's very rainbow Disney, just as I think it should be Lux's own kit, characteristic of his personality and essence ❤\n\nThis has been all about my review, I'm sorry if I don't explain something well, I'm learning english yet >&lt;\nI think you did a good job and you have the potential to do it still better ❤  I appreciate your time and attention, thank you very much ❤\n{{sticker:sg-lux}}","replies":[{"poster":"Bragott","date":"2019-11-30T17:28:15.641+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:sg-lux}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lol you wild wyd","date":"2019-11-25T16:18:17.378+0000","up_votes":53,"down_votes":3,"body":"Ult needs more \"laser\" it's lacking some umph you know? \n\nOther than that I think when it comes to the money makers Rioters def do not half-ass the work/updates/reworks.\n\nLooks good","replies":[{"poster":"CodeDeath","date":"2019-11-25T22:23:22.276+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"In addition to the Oomph it's lacking, I believe her current R has some heat shimmer/haze which shows better how powerful the beam actually is.

I notice you did some work to highlight the width of the Q (which reads very well), but the rotation of the W means it's more visually busy, and that makes the subtle AoE effect harder to notice.\n\nOtherwise looks great, although I think the rainbow effect on the snare is a bit pushed compared to the rainbow effects elsewhere, which are more subtle in nature. It makes that one seem a bit disconnected from the rest. It also may be my imagination, but the ultimate (across most skins, and especially Star Guardian) doesn't feel *quite* as impactful, but I can't figure out precisely what changed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeathDefied","date":"2019-11-25T17:40:13.293+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"Steel Legion looks like an unfinished skin with this mix of base and its own vfx","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pylot","date":"2019-11-25T16:56:46.968+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks amazing!

I like it a lot. I only have two pieces of feedback:\n\nBase skin: The only thing I'm not convinced is the gold/yellow coloration on the shield (W). It looks great and feels magical, but the color doesn't convey \"made of light\" as much.\n\nElementalist lux: I feel that the new ground indicator on the ult is way too noticeable, especially compared to the rest of the skins.\n\nOther than that, it is awesome and really well made.

I love the enhanced lightning effect on her E and R but her Q effects when it hits an enemy looks too similar to the base skin for a 1350 RP skin and her W has the same effect. So my only suggestion is maybe make the shield and Q hit look a little more blue to give it that electric vibe? Otherwise the other skins are looking great. Just a bit sad that the other skins like Sorceress, Spell thief and Commando share the base VFX.
