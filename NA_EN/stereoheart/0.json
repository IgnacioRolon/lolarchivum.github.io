I got banned 3 months ago for 2 weeks for I myself think borderline insane comments to my team. That was 2 weeks. I&#039;m normally a nice and shy person but I seem to be a keyboard warrior. The last 3 games I could be considered a flamer, I say could be because some people like to make a mouse into a elephant. I probably got reported for building some armor on Fiora when I was accidentally feeding a Yasuo top lane. Now they were not being nice to say the least. Okay, I spammed some pings and said &#039;lee&#039; ( my jungler) a couple times, but so did they. I do think I could be banned for 1 week but not permanently, it&#039;s not even my desire to play LoL, my brother and his friends will make fun of me forever, maybe my parents will get upset.\r\n\r\nDear regards, StereoHeart.","replies":[{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2016-03-08T19:48:38.341+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You got a warning in your 14 day ban.","replies":[{"poster":"StereoHeart","date":"2016-03-08T19:49:51.163+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"That I would be perma banned?","replies":[{"poster":"alasarcher","date":"2016-03-08T19:54:24.954+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=StereoHeart,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=sowj0yt8,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2016-03-08T19:49:51.163+0000)\n>\n> That I would be perma banned?\n\nYes. 14 days ban means they drew virtual line in front of you.

Dozens of non reportable chatlogs have been posted on this forum which resulted in bans here.  RIOT just digs way back to the original warnings to find the toxic chat logs to present as evidence for the perma ban in the present.  Meaning there is no ability to reform if you get repeatedly reported AFTER your first legit reports which you've reformed from.  Simply getting false reports after valid reports in the past will get you perma banned.
