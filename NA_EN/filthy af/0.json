I take responsibility for my actions and accept the outcome. Just a shame what goes on on a day to day basis thru comms and nothing ever happens to people who ACTUALLY deserve to be punished. Every single game there's someone bashing another player, with the most obscene vulgarities and they go unpunished despite being reported. Seems kinda backwards to me.
