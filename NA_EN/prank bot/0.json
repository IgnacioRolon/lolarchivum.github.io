I JUST NOW DECIDED TO SEE IF I COULD GET THE ACCOUNT BACK AND IF THE COMMUNITY SUPPORTED MY OPINION. FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN, I HAVE A FAIRLY UNPOPULAR OPINION REGARDING WHETHER I WAS DESERVING OF THIS BAN, SO THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE INPUT! I NOW BELIEVE THAT I WAS TRULY DESERVING OF THIS BAN.\nHey guys, basically I want your opinions on this. I had a game where I was a pretty toxic jerk to be honest. I wouldn&#039;t have argued a 2 week suspension (in fact I would have defended it), but do you guys really think this deserved a straight permanent ban? (LET ME MAKE IT VERY CLEAR that I AM NOT defending this behavior, I am simply arguing it warranted a 2-week suspension, not a permanent ban). \nAlso, note that I think the highest punishment my account had received prior to this was a 5 game chat suspension quite a few months before this happened. _**Riot Tantram plz notice me senpai.**_\nThese are the chat logs that show up in the ban card:\nPrank Bot: FUCK MY LIFE\nPrank Bot: I ONLY STAYED FOR THE CAnnon\nPrank Bot: AND I LAGGED OUT\nPrank Bot: AND DIDNT GET IT\nPrank Bot: i was checking my phgone\nPrank Bot: remind me what that dmg came from..?\nPrank Bot: definitely not\nPrank Bot: she hit 1 vital\nPrank Bot: yeah wtf is bard\nPrank Bot: yep\nPrank Bot: trust me i play a lot of draven ik lol\nPrank Bot: dw i have lvl 6 on draven too\nPrank Bot: almost 6\nPrank Bot: 7*\nPrank Bot: gotcha bitch\nPrank Bot: wouldnt have mattered lol\nPrank Bot: still wouldve got ya :)\nPrank Bot: yes\nPrank Bot: no i wasnt :P\nPrank Bot: besides u died\nPrank Bot: so its k :)\nPrank Bot: damn morg shield lol\nPrank Bot: wouldve got u guys\nPrank Bot: bard stfu and stay in fountain\nPrank Bot: draven is bad\nPrank Bot: ?\nPrank Bot: ur bad tho?\nPrank Bot: im shitting on u xd\nPrank Bot: lol ur shit draven\nPrank Bot: LOL MORG\nPrank Bot: OUR BARD INT FED DRAVEN Xd\nPrank Bot: fk outta here\nPrank Bot: ur a degenerate\nPrank Bot: ur is an abbreviation fucking retard\nPrank Bot: feed me more plz\nPrank Bot: uir so ez\nPrank Bot: lol bard saved u?\nPrank Bot: def report his stupid ass\nPrank Bot: ????\nPrank Bot: ur the trash draven who needs an int feeder to get kills xD\nPrank Bot: NOC\nPrank Bot: WHAT\nPrank Bot: THE\nPrank Bot: FYUCK\nPrank Bot: HELP ME YOU FUCKING DEGENERATE\nPrank Bot: DUDE\nPrank Bot: I COULDVE KILLED HIM\nPrank Bot: FUCK YOU\nPrank Bot: FUCKING USELESS\nPrank Bot: got baited by a dumb cuck noc\nPrank Bot: lmfao sure draven\nPrank Bot: ur fucking trash\nPrank Bot: didnty have someone int feed me like u xsd\nPrank Bot: xd\nPrank Bot: but im not\nPrank Bot: played almost no ranked this season\nPrank Bot: usually s2 xD\nPrank Bot: that was flex\nPrank Bot: that was not soloq xD\nPrank Bot: messing with friendsin flex u fucking retard\nPrank Bot: check my rank last season degenerate\nPrank Bot: LOL\nPrank Bot: NO IT ISNT\nPrank Bot: ur illiterate xD\nPrank Bot: look at my rank last season you cuck\nPrank Bot: draven\nPrank Bot: are you illiterate?\nPrank Bot: i haven&#039;t played ranked much this season\nPrank Bot: look at my fucking rank last season\nPrank Bot: honestly i don&#039;t even care what you think\nPrank Bot: LOL\nPrank Bot: i get 30 lp per win\nPrank Bot: that shit is fucking easy\nPrank Bot: lol no..\nPrank Bot: i play cait you fucking dgenerate\nPrank Bot: im done with u\nPrank Bot: ur so fucking retarded\nPrank Bot: muted\nPrank Bot: jinx\nPrank Bot: why\nPrank Bot: 1/8 jinx\nPrank Bot: 2/19 bard\nPrank Bot: clearly it&#039;s draven&#039;s skill lmfao\nPrank Bot: why bard\nPrank Bot: why us\nPrank Bot: lol i muted his dumb ass\nPrank Bot: VEIGAR","replies":[{"poster":"Rand0mH3r0X","date":"2017-07-11T12:00:47.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's Riot Tantrum.\n\nYou might've already received a 2 week ban before at some point.

They aren't touchable because they troll or play [\"play\"] within RIOT rules - I tried this on my other account and it works well !\n A big part of punished players are genuine not toxic in their behavior, they only got frustrated and expressed their feelings without even calling names. \nOthers who got punished were not even toxic, they only tried to defend themselves or explain the situation, which was done in neutral way (yes, being truthful in this game means also being negative too). Anything what is not Positive, can be called being negative and therefore punishable.  \n\nI'm not talking about blatant toxicity, but enjoying punishments for others being neutral and picked out of context \"negativity\" means that you are toxic and hypocrite yourself since nobody is perfect.
