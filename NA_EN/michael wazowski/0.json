Please help!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK, so my old MacBook which ran league just fine, just broke so now I have an old MacBook Pro that runs on the old operating system. I think it's like 10.6 or something like that or 10.7, and the operating system cannot update any further. I have installed league  and tried to launch the client. It won't launch, all it does is bounce one  time on my dock when I click it and then nothing happens. I've tried deleting it  and  re-installing it, but to no success. I have attempted  to go in and delete the UserKernel, but it was all too confusing for me, I'm not very savvy with computers. Could someone please  help me figure out why this is happening, or guide me step-by-step through what I should be doing in a simple way LOL. I'm looking for the simplest (free from spending money)solution possible, but, if I must spend money, I will inevitably. I really want to play League. Ive had to play on friends computers every once in a blue moon, and even then, that's embarrassing af. Any help is appreciated, and thank you very much in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-01T01:07:51.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm this seems like your Mac OS might actually be outright blocking League from opening. When you see that icon bounce, it means League is attempting to open, but if your OS doesn't recognize the program as being safe there's a chance for it getting stopped.

I got sidetracked, I ended up resetting the old mac to wipe all the junk that was previously on it (didn't need it, don't worry lol) now the problem is that it says league, \" Quit Unexpectedly.\n\n The options given to me are to: report, relaunch or ignore. Of course, I hit relaunch.... same message pops up about 2 times, and then it asks me if I would like to reset application settings for league of legends, and it gives me the options to: do not re-launch, reset and re-launch, or just re-launch. Me, not being tech savvy at all, just hit reset and relaunch, hoping it would get better, but instead, it takes me to a new message that says that the \"RiotMacContainer\" quit unexpectedly. It then gives me the option to (once again): ignore, report, or relaunch. It is a never ending cycle and I don't even know where to start. \n\n\n----*SIDE NOTE*----\n I read in a lol forum that league (supposedly) changed so that the minimum requirements allowed for running League are now OS 10.8, this would complicate things, considering I can only run 10.5 At max on my computer right now .. :( ...(it's so old lmao)\n\nAlso, thank you so much for your troubles Broporo. If you couldn't tell, I'm dying to play some league haha.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-01T22:13:19.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea sadly the [**minimum Mac specs **](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752654#section-mac)list that you'll need at least Mac OS X 10.7.5 or higher =\\ .
