From the following video(s), I could say that it is most likely not a visual bug as can see in the first video provided that the ability actually does activate four times and does damage properly to all enemies. However looking from the second video, the only target here is Annie so I can&#039;t exactly say that it&#039;s 100% not a visual bug.\n\n[Video Reference 1](http://plays.tv/video/56a7de368eb7b05a6c)\n[Video Reference 2](http://plays.tv/video/56a7df47535c202340)\n\nFor any additional information here is also the ingame log file of the game from the first video.\n[Link to the Ingame-Log-Files](https://www.mediafire.com/?5aceww9os9vphnm)\n\nOne last point to note is the fact that these references are only the Eternum Rek&#039;Sai skin and it may not happen with other skins.","replies":[{"poster":"Rubbrbandman","date":"2016-01-26T23:34:24.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have more videos of this happening if you guys would like to see them as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Codebear","date":"2016-01-26T21:55:03.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1 on this.

The bug does appear randomly throughout the game, it could be from the first Q activated to somewhere in the middle of the game, or not at all.","replies":[]}]}]}
