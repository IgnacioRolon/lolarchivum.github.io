Here it goes...\n\n* Upgrade your yellow trinket to the one that supplies 2 wards ASAP\n \n> As long as you&#039;re throwing down wards where you don&#039;t have vision you know where your enemy isn&#039;t. That&#039;s half the battle as they say.\n\n* Last hit minions.\n\n> Repeated time and time again, last hitting minions is the primary source of gold in the game. Reevaluate what type of game you think this is if you&#039;re kill hungry with low CS. The team that wins is the team that has the better items for the situation. Increase your chances of having the right item for the right scenario by making sure you have plenty of gold.\n\n* Chase the objective, not the kill\n\n> Sure you could get the risky and not guaranteed kill and the gold or you could get the less risky and more guaranteed objective (plus gold) since your enemy has to go all the way back to base.\n\n* Figure out what your team lacks during team fights and fill the role.\n\n> If you notice your ADC gets melted by their fault or by no fault of their own, instead of berating your ADC for their poor choices direct the champ with the best peel on your team to peel for them. Face it, telling someone they suck v. simply picking up their slack is really no choice at all when it comes to winning v. losing. If you feel the need to tell them how badly they suck tell them after the victory screen so you can say \"Be awesome like me baddie.\"\n\n* Do not berate your teammates.\n\n> No matter what they do, stay away from saying \"u suk plz kill urself\". Regardless if they deserve it in your mind or not that&#039;s not going to really make you feel as good as you could. Winning will make you feel way better than that fleeting feeling you get blowing off steam onto your teammate. You join the game hoping you&#039;ll win, bottom line. Help yourself attain that feel good goal by specifically telling them what they are doing wrong. Instead of saying \"so bad, plz afk\" say \"[Action you want them to do RIGHT THEN AND THERE]\" such as \"take dragon with me now\" \"come get blue buff\".\n\n* A 5-man team doing the wrong thing together is better than 1 teammate doing the right thing and 4 still doing the wrong thing.\n\n> If you&#039;re reading this and finding useful tidbits chances are your enemy will have not. That means they won&#039;t have the cohesion your team will when you dutifully follow the wrong call which means that even though it&#039;s not the best decision, your team is going to come out on top!\n\n* Use smart pings.\n\n> By using smart pings rather than simple generic pings, it gives your teammates a lot more information. Know on how it's common knowledge that vision wins games? Vision wins games because it's actually knowledge that wins games and vision is knowledge of where the enemy team is or isn't.\n\nIf others have any suggestions feel free to comment with them and I&#039;ll add them to the list. Remember, this is a list of immediate changes you can make in your games to see almost guaranteed immediate results. Decision making things are a bit difficult to say \"You're doing this wrong, do it this way pretty much always.\" Things like \"upgrade yellow trinket at level 9\" v. \"ignore yellow trinket the whole game\" work a bit better for players that need them to see their almost immediate results.","replies":[{"poster":"Fried Noob","date":"2015-04-27T04:06:34.474+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can throw in learn when to just let someone die.

And by that, I don't mean a barrage of annoying pings. \n\nIt requires fast fingers (which obviously some don't have, if they don't use the home row method), but actually typing out shit to your teammates and explaining what you should do helps a LOT. \n\nFor example, pinging Dragon with a normal one gives so many vague impressions: Is the guy saying to kill it? Are they getting it? Is it just the 'It's up' ping? \n\nYou gotta talk with your teammates, ESPECIALLY if you're the fucking jungler. \"We need drag, up in 30 secs\" \"Pull it out of the pit\", if you're on Purple / Red side.   Adding in those words might end up changing how teammates react, usually for the better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Naga the god","date":"2015-04-27T04:13:33.975+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Zamaje","date":"2015-04-28T04:09:14.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TsukuyÃ²mi,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=E9z32ed3,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-04-27T04:13:33.975+0000)\n>\n> The only thing that increases your elo is winning. In order to win you must simply have the ability to play the game. The only two things you have to do is increase your game knowledge and practice so you are able to make better decisions and have better mechanics. The rest are bullshit sorry.\n\nThe idea is that these are the fabled mechanics. Mechanics are something that can be taught. Decisions are actually a subset of mechanics. Ever notice how a  lot of people say \"get better mechanics\" or \"get better\"? No one ever really says what exactly are the things that make up those things.
