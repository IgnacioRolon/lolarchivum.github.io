Some (or few) people may know of the strange internet meme/trend called [Tsundere Shark](http://i.imgur.com/s3j7Ffm.jpg), granted, Tahm Kench is a catfish, but thats probably as close to a shark as we are going to get, champion wise.\n\nTsundere Shark is a whole subreddit of giggles, I&#039;m not sure how it started but now its a thing and there is no going back.\n\n**Running Animation**\n[RUNNING CLICHE](http://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/f66b734d4d37efb797c198a0e7ff2db21437026076_full.png)\nLike any Tsundere/Japanese Anime schoolgirl, tahm Kench is just out the door after breakfast!\nHis running animation should include toast in the mouth and lots of frantic-ness for Ghost/Speed boosts.\n\n**/Joke**\nTahm Kench should drop his toast, blush and sway side to side. His disguise is bulletproof. No one will suspect that cute schoolgirl is actually Kench.\n\n**Taunt**\nBlows a raspberry at the enemy team, hands on hips. \n\n**death**\nTahm Kench-chan falls over to the side, too embarassed to continue. Senpai looked her/his way!\n\n\n**Other...**\nfeel free to add in comments, I seriously want this to happen. Please let me know how you feel about this skin, how much do you think it should cost?\n\nI believe this should be a 1300ish skin, over a 900 skin.","replies":[{"poster":"WakkaSeta","date":"2016-03-21T06:12:22.883+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I-It's not like I think you're delicious or anything!\"","replies":[{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2016-03-21T15:22:26.994+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:223}} \"D-Don't get the wrong idea, I only ate you cause I was hungry.

Just have a piece of toast on the tip if his tounge.\n\nLove this idea! 20/10 would buy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SnugglePants","date":"2016-03-23T06:09:04.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kench-Chan, a new school - a new you!","replies":[]},{"poster":"CornDoges","date":"2016-03-21T18:13:06.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never wanted Tahm Cruise till now {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"nami tf","date":"2016-03-21T14:24:24.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why do I suddenly wish Academy Annie to be a skin now (Kench was my main btw)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beeblebob","date":"2016-03-21T09:48:09.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sailor Kench! who said LoL champs couldn't cosplay","replies":[]},{"poster":"PaulaBennet","date":"2016-03-21T09:35:27.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"beautiful <3","replies":[]},{"poster":"SnugglePants","date":"2016-03-21T09:33:12.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please leave as many comments as you can guys!","replies":[]}]}
