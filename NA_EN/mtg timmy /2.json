I tell them im smurfing or mention it. Now the 600 games played neg win rate midlaner is like mocking it? ROFL How stupid do you actually have to be to mock someone better than you? Well I guess I would be mad that someone can play 6x less my games in a whole year and achieve the same/higher rank lol. \r\n\r\nBut I dont get it lmao. You should be trying to learn from your good teammate. Unless they dont think you are really smurfing in which case these players cant actually tell a smurf when they see one and dont know how to identify. I also find it hilarious that you can tell a player to play a champion in normals or something when they have a super trash win rate on the champion and do &quot;good&quot; 1 game because a smurf is in your game or just rng that you think &quot;well I showed him&quot; no you really didnt lmao. Your win rate on said hard champion is still awful and will continue to be awful xD.","replies":[]}
