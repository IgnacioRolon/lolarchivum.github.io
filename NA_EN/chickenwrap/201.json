No bugs! Woo!**\n\nUpdated:\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/101246784/Qez's%20Quest%20Alpha%201.2a.exe\nYeah, it didn't turn out that way. Instead, I have an RPG surrounding a guy named Qez and his quest to avenge his mother. The story begins to unfold at the beginning but you aren't really \"let into\" the story until after leaving the main island, where Qez learns all about the magical world of religion and what lengths a cult will go through to summon their god to earth.\n\n**If any of you would like to play the Alpha 1.2 version (Alpha. 1.2. That means there's still a long way to go) and give your feedback for what I have so far so I know what to work on better or what to change up or avoid, I'd really appreciate it.**\n\nThe monster sprites (as well as the music used) are definitely placeholders for now. I'm working on sprites (and music) that fit the game and not the default sprites (and sound tracks). But it's better than nothing, in the time being. (also I have no working death sprites yet. Those also need to be done.) Also, dialogue will most likely be passed over one or two more times before the final game is released.\n\nThere's at least a few hours of gameplay depending on how fast you speed through this and how much you abuse the one-shot spell to cheat boss fights.\n\nRemember to save often, and good luck.\n\nHere are some random screenshots from the game:\nhttp://puu.sh/dpLiU/e8514db8ce.png\nhttp://puu.sh/dfVsp/bd7e4e88f0.jpg\nhttp://puu.sh/dfUSy/c1bed744b5.jpg\nhttp://puu.sh/dfUYW/8ecdd98063.jpg\nhttp://puu.sh/dfV3x/d2e77da084.jpg\nhttp://puu.sh/dfV8R/c1608256d2.jpg\nhttp://puu.sh/dn2dc/1c75ef076e.png\nhttp://puu.sh/dn2hV/b0e62ce950.jpg\nhttp://puu.sh/dn2IA/d409499bde.jpg\nhttp://puu.sh/dn2YZ/aa0c89f061.jpg\nhttp://puu.sh/dpK7K/499eb35f48.jpg","replies":[]}
