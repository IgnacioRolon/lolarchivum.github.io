Where in a teamfight, she's 80% useless and can be interrupted.\n\nThe thing is, soraka is neither strong nor weak.. she's actually in a decent place.

It's pretty frustrating, honestly. It's just a bunch of low elo players circlejerking about low elo problems and telling everyone who says otherwise that they're wrong and stupid.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2016-09-20T01:49:57.203+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"no, this is a board for circlejerking and reaffirming one's own biases\n\nedit: and bad memes","replies":[]}]}
