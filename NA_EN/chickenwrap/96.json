I&#039;ll start playing meta champions like everyone else.\r\n\r\nIt was fun until you made it so that I can no longer enjoy playing my favourite character in your game. You know, the guy who was already screwed by so many bugs and shit that he was almost unplayable BEFORE you made it so that Frost Queen&#039;s Claim was a must-buy for every AP character in the game? Your team is so concerned with tweaking Mordekaiser and Gangplank, but you can&#039;t even be assed to look at serious problem characters?\r\n\r\nShaco needs bug fixes\r\nTahm Kench needs nerfs\r\nIllaoi needs SERIOUS nerfs.\r\nRengar needs to have a lower leap range\r\nSoraka&#039;s heal needs to put her in more danger than it already does\r\nMundo needs his E changes completely reverted\r\nCorki is basically the strongest ADC, and could use some tuning (thank god nobody knows about this one yet)\r\nKindred deals way too much damage for a ranged character that can make everybody invincible. \r\n\r\nBut you&#039;re over here trying so desperately to make _Mordekaiser bot_ work out, you&#039;re not even looking at the problems that are staring you straight in the face. What gives?\r\n\r\nWhat are the stealth champions going to gain to make up for the fact that stealth no longer exists in the game?","replies":[]}
