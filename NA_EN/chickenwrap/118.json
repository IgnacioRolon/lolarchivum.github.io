It endorses botting, and level limits are not a solution for this. It's possible to bot an account to 30 in under a week from what I've read on GD, and I presume that the amount of IP you'd have gained in that week would be substantial. So, someone bots an account and gets at least 30k free IP for it? That's a problem. \n\nAs far as skins for IP goes, that won't happen. Skins are the only real reason people buy RP (the majority, anyway.) and that was the entire reason RP was introduced.\n\nLet us also remember that the entire point of the IP system was that you could buy champions/runes for your arsenal with a currency reflecting your _experience in the game_. That is to say that, you earn these things by playing the game yourself, not getting gifted them. With the exception of someone spending cash for RP to gift it to you, you have to earn it. That's one of the more appealing aspects of League of Legends, in my opinion. And that's why myself and most of my friends started playing LoL to begin with. It's a game focused on individual skill and teamwork, not Pay2Play or even Pay2Win.","replies":[{"poster":"ChickenWrap","date":"2014-08-05T00:17:03.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">To gift 5 6300 camps with the proposed 1.5x ratio, it would cost someone 47250 IP.
