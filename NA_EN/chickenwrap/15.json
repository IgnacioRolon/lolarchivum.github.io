The players are here! Joy is nigh, but something&#039;s queer..._\n\n_Bilgewater Hall hosts the Bilgewater Ball one night every year. It sits atop a large hill with quite the winding road leading up to its doors. Those unfamiliar with the hall would say they find it rather menacing (and they'd be right to think so). What happens on those nights is some of the seediest and shadiest things that could ever happen in Bilgewater, but due to the lack of policing, anything goes at these events. That includes, dear readers, extortion, philandering, and above all, on this fateful night, murder._\n\n_As the guests begin to enter the building, a man stands outside taking names. He&#039;s missing an eye and a couple of his teeth. What looks like mold is growing across his face and his clothing is in tatters. He has a long, hooked nose and there&#039;s a cigar in his mouth. It&#039;s not lit and he&#039;s constantly chewing on it. It&#039;s hard to tell if he&#039;s in costume or if he&#039;s just naturally that ugly. In his hand he holds a lantern to help him see his work better._\n\n{{item:3691}} Name?\n{{champion:40}} My name is Janna.\n{{champion:99}} I&#039;m Lux!\n_The man checks his notes and gives a curt nod._\n{{item:3691}} In you go, ladies.\n_The two enter the building and are quickly swept out of sight by the events inside. The next guest steps up in line._\n{{item:3691}} And you are?\n{{champion:104}} The man about to show you to your New Destiny.\n{{item:3691}} Right... In you go.\n{{item:3691}} Aah! Twisted Fate. You&#039;re the one we&#039;ve been waiting for most here! Please, right this way.\n_The man grins big and wide as Twisted Fate tips his hat in response._\n{{champion:4}} Why thank you kindly.\n_He then gestures grandly at the front door, ushering the man inside._\n{{item:3691}} Let us know if there&#039;s anything we can do for you, Mister Fate. You _are_ our guest of honour, after all.\n{{champion:4}} That&#039;ll hardly be necessary, but I&#039;ll keep that in mind. Thank you again, Josiah.","replies":[]}
