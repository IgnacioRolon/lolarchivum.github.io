They have succumbed to the trolls and the weak willed who cried constantly about wanting shorter surrender times.  The game has turned into a snowball fest or surrender at 15.   People give up when they feed hard and cause a snowball so they want to surrender even faster now.  The state of the game is very poor right now and its because we catered to the weakest willed people who cried incessantly about shorter surrender times, easier towers, higher damage, and faster matches.  You know what has all that?  Counterstrike.\n\nSo we let the counterstrike people dictate our once beautiful and deep strategy game into the snowball fest its become....and you wonder why people are 'abusing' the 15 surrenders...its the same people who will ask for 10 minute and then 5 minute surrenders...and then cry and whine for no towers which used to be a key element in the strategic play of the game.  Now they are a bad joke...and riot has let it happen because they don't care about a quality game anymore.\n\nConsidering this...SURRENDER VOTES should be a stat added to your profile and should be seen by your teammates when entering a draft.  There should be a penalty for surrendering in ranked but because there isn't...its abused just like feeding, dodging, tanking, etc.  I don't play ranked because I can't take playing with the poorest mentally skilled individuals playing solo in a team game.  I'd much rather join a ranked team but don't have the time to commit.  Still, I'd much rather the option to surrender be completely removed but that would lead to a flood of afks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Arsinik","date":"2017-05-18T22:59:46.396+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Honestly wish instead of making it fifteen minutes in they went the other way and just removed the option completely.
