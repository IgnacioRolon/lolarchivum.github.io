Also, if you start to think about it, a good Volibear will always use his E when both Shaco and his clone attack him, so nope, there is no waste in casting an AoE slow with damage, that also neutralizes the clone for damn 3 seconds.\n\nI may have misunderstood your concept about waste, but waste actual meaning is:\nto consume, spend, or employ uselessly or without adequate return; use to no avail or profit; squander. The thing you mentioned is not a WASTE, is a trade-off. A waste would be to play Darius and R the enemy Clone, killing it but actually have no reset. That is when Shaco tricked you perfectly, making you pay a big price that can cost them a whole teamfight. But if you think a Volibear E is such a powerful ability that it is a \"waste\" to use it and shut down two main core elements of Shaco's Ultimate ( the \"find the Shaco\" game and the raw DPS the clone provides) then I don't know what to say anymore...","replies":[{"poster":"Comrade Napoleon","date":"2016-06-15T07:28:38.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very reasonable argument, i agree.","replies":[{"poster":"Anu3isII","date":"2016-06-15T20:14:25.814+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, now when I read again the wall of text I wrote, I want to say I'm sorry for my aggressive way of writing. I played this match-up from both sides, and it feels totally unfair for each one of the champions.\n\nAs Shaco, you feel as you are cheated by your own toys, participating at a really bad joke. As an Assassin, your role is to kill the enemy carries and get away with it or kill the rest of them. If you ever want to get to a carry as Shaco, you have to use your Q, one of your escapes , to reach them. Your back-up plan will always be to use your Ultimate to perfectly dodge one or more powerful abilities, and try to trick all the enemies with the clone. You can also use your boxes, but, from a certain point of the game, they begin to die before they get invisible. If a Volibear is standing between you and his carries (he is the tank, he must protect them), then your only options are to run or go YOLO for maximum one kill, because after you use your Ultimate, Volibear will use his E and all his team will focus you down.\n\nFrom my perspective, I see Volibear as a big bear with lots of raw power that can destroy almost anyone he faces in a face-to-face fight (or better said vs melee champions), and, even if I don't know who is the real Shaco, I can use my Ultimate to deal AoE damage, my E to deal AoE damage , and my W deals so much damage that I can burst Shaco easily (and much more easier the clone, because it takes more damage than Shaco). And again, because the clone takes more damage than the real one, and Volibear is more of an AoE DPS bruiser with Sunfire/Cinderhulk as core items, I can easily check who is who, or even kill them both at the same time xD.\n\nSo ... yeah, it feels like unnecessary power added randomly just because of an weird interaction.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Deckowner","date":"2016-06-13T14:18:17.996+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.mememaker.net/static/images/memes/3711873.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shinirup","date":"2016-06-14T00:37:51.019+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"But he is Shaco.

He has to build damage or he won't be a threat, he has to build tank or he can't survive long enough to heal from his autos.  He needs the now guinsoos effect to be able to heal quickly enough to sustain through a fight which requires him to get 6 auto attacks off in a fight before he dies while he has an item slot dedicated to guinsoos giving him no bonus survivability until he gets it stacked up.  There are no attack speed/defensive items except for wit's end which isn't a good item on him, while there are other items that provide attack damage/defense of some sort like maw or sterak's or any other ad/health item.  His early game is pretty weak, he has ok damage but he's pretty paper thin and his W doesn't heal for much at early ranks, so anyone that can trade heavily early will usually be able to get their cooldowns up again before he heals up to a safe amount.  His passive revives him, but it's a 4 minute cd early, so if you're laning with him and get ganked once you basically have to farm under tower until it's up again.  His main fantasy is this giant late game sword swinging unkillable blood demon, and it's great, but it's almost impossible to get to that point with him because his early game is so weak.  At the start of season 6 when devourer guinsoos was a thing he had the potential to be crazy strong, but he needed to basically farm til 20 minutes and get some really opportunistic ganks to get rolling.  I had a lot of fun with him for the month or so that he was really strong at the beginning of the season, 21 minute solo barons were a thing of beauty.  They talk about feast or famine champs, and how they're not healthy, Aatrox is the single most feast or famine champion in the game, except he starves way more often than he feasts.  You can jungle with him really easily, he has great sustain against the camps, but if anyone invades you your only options are either run away or lose.  The fact that his good healing only comes when he's below 50% health is ok, but anyone with an execute will just bypass your ability to use it by executing you before you can heal.  There is no single core item on him that gives him a formidable power spike like there are on all the other champions, it is only a combination of items so that you can get a smattering of all of the stats that you need that give him any kind of power spike.  You need attack speed, in addition to your bloodwell and ultimate, in order to swing fast enough to be effective, you need defensive stats so you don't get instantly bursted down when you engage, you need bonus damage, either from on hit or from extra ad, in order to be a threat to carries in teamfights because you basically can't use blood price in a teamfight without guaranteeing your own death.  You can use it in trades in lane pretty effectively if you've got a good matchup, but after that it's basically just a way to farm up your bloodwell.  High damage, high lifesteal builds can work, but if you catch a single cc you're dead.  He hasn't been really strong in like 3 years, riot keeps it that way intentionally because they don't like the idea of really high self healing, or healing in general unless it's soraka doing it.  They want tanks to tank by being tanky, but then they give tanks incredibly high base damages on all their moves so they can still be a threat.  Aatrox doesn't get this, because he's designed to be an auto attack based champion, so you can't just build straight tank or you're completely useless.  This makes him build damage, which is all well and good, but it forces you to choose a weakness early, and hope that your farm is good enough to last until you've shored up all of your weaknesses.  He basically needs like 3 finished items before he feels like he's in a safe enough place stats wise to fight.  Once he gets there it's great, and he's not bad as a sleeper pick since he doesn't see much play so people don't really know just how soft he is early, but you basically have to trick people into thinking you're not weak until you get there or they'll run over top of you without you being able to do much about it.  And if they do put you behind early it's pretty much impossible to catch up, even at 6 items, because other champions scale harder into the late game and you can be kited pretty easily.","replies":[{"poster":"4th Chiming Lamb","date":"2016-06-15T04:58:40.992+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"...Thanks!
