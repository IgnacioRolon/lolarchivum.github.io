They have an inherent disadvantage over ranged champions.\nNow, of course, the same is true of laners, but the dynamics of a lane are somewhat different.  Melee laners generally don't take (much) damage from the lane itself (e.g. minions), even if they are open to ranged harass and can be zoned by their enemies.\nMeanwhile, a jungler is going to be taking damage in their jungle.  Many junglers, especially the weaker ones, will often be at fairly low health levels during their first few clears.\n\nThat's why invading the other jungler can work - if you can arrive when they are weakened, or have their abilities on cooldown, you can fight them when you have an advantage.\nHowever, the invaded jungler can still fight back and often win, especially if they saw you coming.\n\nThe problem comes in when the invading jungler is ranged.  The melee jungler usually doesn't have the tools to deal with a ranged attacker, especially at early levels, so the ranged jungler can just kite them to death very easily.  Again, lane matchups are slightly different because minion aggro is very important at giving melee laners some indirect protection from harassment, which is lacking in the jungle.\n\nWhen that ranged champion is also quite good at winning duels even if the melee manages to close the gap, then it starts to become really unfair.  Add in a dash to allow them to escape if the enemy team close in on them, and you end up with a powerful champion who can easily deny the opposing jungler and completely ruin their day, while also scaling to be useful in the late game.\n\nKindred also had this problem to some extent when they were strong, though in their case it was mostly that their ult made them too hard to kill during invades post-level 6.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rozzeta","date":"2017-02-25T22:45:03.577+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's \"CertainlyT\"oo strong","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bisaknosp","date":"2017-02-25T19:42:40.038+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"i want his ult nerfed tbh\nits way too strong\nand punish more for not getting AS items so he wont be able to build as much ad/tanky stats","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2017-02-25T23:56:02.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They already did that, and it quelled people's complaints until now, when Lethality has become an issue.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2017-02-25T17:29:54.146+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"I feel like they made his basic attacks powerful because they are supposed to be \"limited\" while they are really not THAT limited (Jhin really looks like having much more limitations).","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2017-02-25T21:58:11.045+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"Having less/equal range than Urgot as an ADC isn't limited?
