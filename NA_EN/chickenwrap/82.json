Help me pick one please GD.","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is the most serious thread I've ever made in my entire life.\n\nMy ex refused to let me keep _my_ cat that _I_ paid for and who bonded with _me_ when we broke up because it was adopted under her name since adoption would have been easier that way since she already had cats and she had promised to put said cat under my name time and again but never did. She then tried to use said animal as a bargaining chip to get me to take her back when I finally broke up with her. \n\nI very much miss my shitpost companion (As seen here https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion/cBshUdZL-hello-humans ) and now that I am back in a place that will allow me to have one, I need some help. Below you will find pictures of all the cats that I'm looking at potentially adopting next week in the three closest towns to me. Please vote and comment about which cat is best cat and why.\n\nUnfortunately \"All of them\" is not the correct answer here as I can only adopt one.\n\n\nhttp://74.207.252.210:5000/service?method=animal_image&amp;animalid=3573&amp;username=apitest&amp;password=apitest2017#\n\nhttp://74.207.252.210:5000/service?method=animal_image&amp;animalid=3579&amp;username=apitest&amp;password=apitest2017#\n\nhttp://74.207.252.210:5000/service?method=animal_image&amp;animalid=3559&amp;username=apitest&amp;password=apitest2017#\n(These are different cats, surprisingly.)\nhttp://74.207.252.210:5000/service?method=animal_image&amp;animalid=3562&amp;username=apitest&amp;password=apitest2017#\n\nhttp://74.207.252.210:5000/service?method=animal_image&amp;animalid=3560&amp;username=apitest&amp;password=apitest2017#\n\nhttps://puu.sh/DX0Ka/e2d1e26071.png\n\nhttps://pet-uploads.adoptapet.com/1/6/9/423394115.jpg\n\nhttps://pet-uploads.adoptapet.com/1/a/c/423214230.jpg\n\nhttps://pet-uploads.adoptapet.com/7/8/3/423209598.jpg","replies":[]}
