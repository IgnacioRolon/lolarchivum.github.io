If so, that's how you get presents for Christmas, but if not, then you get coal _and_ a post removal, which perpetuates further bad behaviour (I'm Canadian and we spell behaviour with a u), and the cycle continues.\n\nNow, to help combat this problem, I've compiled a handy guide to mod removals and why it happens -- chances are, you've actually broken the rules somehow. while this may not _always_ be the case, it will be in the vast majority of them.\n\nWithout further adieu, here we go:\n---\n> I called someone out for cheating or trolling, but my post got removed. What gives? Does Riot (note: We aren't Riot) want cheaters and trolls running around their game!?\n\nYou see, Timmy, some mods (such as myself) like to self-edit out the name of the perpetrator that you dropped in the middle of your post calling him out, or remove the picture that you posted. Other mods are clearing the queue or are preoccupied with their children (ranging from cats to people and even a pet rock or two) and simply don't have the time to allocate to going through your post the entire way through to remove your rule-breaking content, so they will ask that you simply re-create your post without calling them (the mod and also the player you're name-dropping) out.\n\n> I posted something I thought belonged in Gameplay because it pertains to the game but it was deleted. Why!?\n\nActually, Emily, just because something happened to you _in the game_ does not mean it pertains to game_play_. Gameplay is specifically for discussing balance, champions, and the like. Not for the way someone else treated you. That belongs in [Player Behaviour](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation) (again, Canadian). PB is a place where you can talk about your un-just ban or complain about the way other people treat you (you can also do that on GD, where we are now!). However, the best way to get your problem across is by reporting them at the end of the game, and if you really feel the need, going to the [support](https://support.riotgames.com/) website and making a ticket there.\n\n> I can't believe nobody likes my 420 Maokai skin! I put a lot of effort into that and the mods just REMOVED IT!\n\nAh yes, Tess. Well, the thing is: If you posted it in SA&amp;S (It doesn't go there, by the way, that's for something else) or Concepts &amp; Creations, it was probably removed for being _non-constructive_. While it may be a funny skin, that's much more suited for Memes &amp; Games or General Discussion. Story, Art, and Sound is for, well, those things.  If you want to post there, you're generally going to be asked to put a lot more work and effort into something rather than Kushmaster Kayn, as funny as that would be.\n\n> Mods are censoring me because I TALKED BAD ABOUT RITO GAME!\n\nIn fact, Issac, we probably didn't do that. What we _did_ do was remove you for being baselessly rude (speaking of baselessly rude, see below). It's OK to say \"I diisagree with ABC that Riot has done because XYZ.\" It _isn't_ OK to say \"Riot are all stupid idiot butt-faces who should be taken out back and SHOT because Ryze is STILL %&amp;$*ING BROKEN.\" (even though you're right and Ryze is broken).\n\nYou see the difference, yeah?\n\n> The player that insulted me didn't get a post removal when I _DID_ after I insulted him back.\n\nWell, Manuelle, did you report them? We usually go off of the queue and don't always have the time to scour through entire threads (again, pet rocks to feed) to see what started the fighting and who to punish. Rest-assured, if you report them and they show up in our queue, they'll probably get clapped too as long as what they said was insulting. \n\n> I tried to RP on the RP boards and they kicked me out!\n\nYeah, I feel you there.\n---\n#If you feel you've been slighted regardless of all of this, _please_ reach out to us over on the Boards Discord server so that we can help you set the record straight! \n\nWe aren't here to ruin your life -- at least, I think. IDK, being a mod ruined my life but IDK if that's because of the other mods or what. If you're ever in doubt, check out those **Guidelines** on the left-hand side of your page! If you're on mobile, well, sucks to suck, switch to the full site for a second.","replies":[]}
