Let's not screw this up, guys.\n\nThese rules are not final and we're in the discussional stage, so feel free to talk about anything rules-wise that you want to talk about here so we can get a final draft up as soon as possible,\n\nBe sure to check up on the [Universal Rules](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/site-feedback/QMLzFo0N-universal-rules) first. From there, our first three rules go into a tad bit more detail so as not to allow for any confusion.\n\n1) Going further regarding pornographic content:  It doesn't matter if it's covering its genitals with one hand, it's too revealing. Provocative images are OK, but try to keep the images clothed, otherwise the image may be removed. We will, however, allow the discussion of more \"mature\" themes as long as it's not clearly pornographic in nature. You are allowed to talk about sexual themes as long as it doesn't cross into just a talk about sex.\n\n2) No gore pictures or threads will be allowed. Remember that League of Legends, and therefore, the forums pertaining to the game, are also rated T, not 18+. Until gore is allowed in Teen rated games, it won't be accepted here. Blood *is* allowed, as long as it's not attached to anything that someone would find offensive.\n\n3) Respect the mods and they will respect you. The new mods should understand the culture of GD and work with us as a whole to help keep us moving forward instead of backward. If you feel something unfair has happened, please, instead of calling out the mods, make a civil thread about it. Although the mods should have very politely informed you of why your content was removed (Riot, please stop giving cookie-cutter responses. People are often genuinely curious when something they think shouldn't have been removed was removed.) in a private notification directed toward you after the removal.\n\n4) No excessive thread or \"meme\" spamming. We understand that you want to have fun, but your fun doesn't have to come at the frustration of others. \n\n5) We understand if you want to call someone \"stupid\" or \"dumb\" for something as a joke, or make light of a bad situation or say \"brb killing self\" but again, try to keep yourself from singling out specific members of the board and attacking them. We get that you want to have fun, but again, don't do so at the expense of others. The mods here should be able to have a pretty firm grasp on what's OK and what's not OK in this sense because we're most likely going to end up with community mods.\n\n6) If your thread receives a vast majority of downvotes, it is subject to be taken down. Many members of GD (a majority over the small vocal minority here) want this rule enacted. The way this rule would work, if enacted, is somewhat the same of the \"report\" function. If a thread receives X downvotes, then a mod will be notified and it will be up to their discretion to remove the thread or to leave it up based upon the content of the thread and the conversation within.\n\n**Remember!**\nIf you ask yourself \"Is this too much?\" or \"is this OK?\" then it's *probably* too much and not OK.\n\nEdit 1: \nAdded a \"no blood and gore\" rule,\nChanged Rule 1 slightly.\n\nEdit 2: \nChanged some of the earlier rules again\nAdded three more.\n\nEdit 3L\nEdited rule 2 for slightly more clarity.\n\nEdit 4: \nSee above Edit 1.\n\nEdit 5:\nMade things more clear by also linking Universal Rules.\n\nEdit 7:\nAdded slightly more to rule 1.\n\nEdit 8:\nEdited rule 2 for more clarity.\nFeel free to discuss the current rules or to add more rules as you see fit. Let's get this self moderation thing going as soon as we can, team!\n\nEdit 9: \nMade Rule 6 more clear for those coming in to the thread so they don't keep asking the same question that's already been answered.","replies":[]}
