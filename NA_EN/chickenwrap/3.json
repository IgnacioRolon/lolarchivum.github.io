It was scheduled for arrival at 9:10. It&#039;s now 9:14.\n{{champion:122}} Where the hell is the train? I&#039;ve been waiting four minutes longer than I was meant to! Are they daring to oppose Noxus!? \n\nBut just then, a voice rang through the loudspeaker.\n{{champion:240}} HEY! LISTEN UP! THERE WAS A BAD THING DUN HAPPENED AND THEM IRON BULLS ARE RUNNIN&#039; SLOWER THAN USUAL! KEEP THE KNOTS OUTTA YER KNICKERS AND JUST KEEP WAITIN&#039;!\n\nBut Darius&#039; Knickers _were_ knotted\n{{champion:122}} I CAN&#039;T TAKE THIS ANYMORE! \n\nHe said, shoving a little girl to the side and forcing his way to the front of the line of people.\n{{champion:122}} If I have to wait one more minute, I am going to scream! I need to get to work!\n\nBut just then, the train arrived! Darius hurried on and sat down next to a not-so-little girl. She was a whole entire adult.\n{{champion:122}} Ugh. What a day! \nhttps://puu.sh/wM8uZ/621de238c2.png You&#039;re telling me.\n{{champion:122}} Oh, no.

Okay.\nhttps://puu.sh/wM8uZ/621de238c2.png So where do you work?\n{{champion:122}} I&#039;m a general manager for the Noxian Knuckleheads. \nhttps://puu.sh/wM8uZ/621de238c2.png The famous basketball team?\n{{champion:122}} Yes, that one.\nhttps://puu.sh/wM8zx/5a16e29916.png Oh wow, that&#039;s incredible!\n{{champion:122}} Ma&#039;am. Your eyes.\nhttps://puu.sh/wM8zx/5a16e29916.png Oh, are they doing that _again?_ HAHA! Silly me...\nhttps://puu.sh/wM8zx/5a16e29916.png They do that...\nhttps://puu.sh/wM8zx/5a16e29916.png When I...\nhttps://puu.sh/wM8HH/95b7d9672e.png See something...\nhttps://puu.sh/wM8HH/95b7d9672e.png I like.\nhttps://puu.sh/wM8Jl/a28b2839f9.png Come to mama\n\nDarius got up immediately, shoving his way through the throng of people. Over the intercom he heard.\n{{champion:240}} YER NOW ARRIVIN&#039; AT, SLAMTOWN!\n\nHe knew he had two more stops before Dunktropolis, but he had to get away from her.\nhttps://puu.sh/wM8Jl/a28b2839f9.png Where are you going!?\n{{champion:122}} THISISMYSTOPGOODBYE.\n\nAnd he exited the train, hopefully to never experience anything like that again.","replies":[]}
