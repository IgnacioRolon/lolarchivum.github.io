If there is no plans to make your own website the primary source of information for your players then why were the forums changed into Boards specifically to feel like Reddit so that the reddit community comes over here. It didnt work they stayed at reddit and you lost many people who posted frequently when you made the transition after telling us you wouldnt force it. Why has there been zero work done to try to make the red tracker into a source for all Developer information? I shouldn't have to go to reddit to give feedback on a idea that affects the game. \n\n\nThe least you could do is have a connection so when a Rioter posts on Reddit it shows up on the red tracker so that those on the forums can contribute at the very least. I know some people like their circle jerks over on reddit and thats fine but unless you don't care about a section of your community you need to do something and fast.

Tryndamere himself came onto the boards to talk about why he did it on reddit and didn't tell anyone on the boards about it. His response was that he didn't think about posting it to the boards which means the boards were an afterthought or were of no concern. Thus hard coding it would allow Rioters who forget or don't use the boards to have the content linked for them in case of them forgetting to post it here. It could also lead to redoing the red tracker all together and allowing it to cover more than just the languages spoken for that server. \n\nI'll explain this, With the multiple development groups within Riot Games being based in different countries there is a language barrier that exists and information that players who do not know the language or actively search for this information would not find (Tencent Chinese run LoL Forums as an example). By recreating the way the red tracker functions Riot could allow it to show all the different regions developer posts. It would be redesigned with dropboxes and checkboxes for certain information/communication types, possibly even going so far as to create a Translation set for the posts. This could then allow a player to have a customized view of the Red tracker only showing information they would find relevant or would be able to read but can change it at anytime to see others. \n\nNow this would be a massive undertaking that would take most likely at least 9 months to complete but would allow Riot to have a much better Communication to their playerbase through it.","replies":[{"poster":"Daen","date":"2015-03-31T14:25:49.632+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">His response was that he didn't think about posting it to the boards which means the boards were an afterthought or were of no concern.

I understand that there are lots of different methods through which Rioters feel comfortable communicating, but the official centrally designed Boards platform should really be a conduit for all of those different methods.  If even Tryndamere considers the Boards to be an afterthought, it's unlikely that any real policy is established in that regard. \n\n>Red Tracker improvements\n\nIndeed.

It's very strange to me that Surrender@20 is better at providing centralized Riot communications than Riot itself, and I don't really understand why important communication like Tryndamere's AMA on communication happens elsewhere (e.g. reddit) and is never even mentioned in passing on the official communication platform (the Boards).\n\nThat being said, it's a tough issue.

We all have some thoughts on moderation philosophies and that's an active discussion internally. \n\n> How would you define the tone and sentiment of the Boards currently, and what directions are you interested in exploring?\n\nTo be blunt, right now the Boards are flooded with \"Riot Plz\" and that's drowning out most other conversation. It's understandable, but we need to focus on the why and the how of this: why is it happening...well, we have a pretty clear idea on that, and how can we address it in a sustainable way?

I mention this a lot, but this community is one of the most developer-focused I have ever seen.  This is good in that there is lots of back and forth communication, but it's bad in the sense that the players may never really form a community of their own that can support itself.  Is this something you have noticed?\n\n>I don't believe that the two are mutually exclusive of each other. In order to draw people who create amazing communities, your leaders, creators, and advocates, you need to ensure that there is a safe environment in which they can grow and flourish.\n\nOh absolutely, and I didn't mean to insinuate they aren't.  I just wonder whether it's the right approach to go for safety rather than invitation.  \n\n>In my experience, a safe environment = a welcoming environment and will, by nature, encourage passionate engagement.\n\nAnalogy!\n\n**Environment #1**\n\nThe DMV, with folding metal chairs and a white tile floor, a police officer keeping watch in case you need him/her.\n\n**Environment #2**\n\nA colorful carpeted room filled with beanbag chairs, can call the police if you need it.\n\nGranted, this is a really biased portrayal, but in which environment would you rather have a party?  Environment #2 is technically less safe, but it's far more inviting and encourages positive behavior just by its innate nature.  \n\nWhat I'm getting at is that safety isn't enough to draw people in on its own, especially people who focus on creating amazing communities.  A safe but sterile community can directly discourage participation, whereas a volatile but inviting community becomes compelling for those interested in participation.  It's important to ensure there is a safe environment, but in my personal opinion it's more important to ensure there is a *compelling* environment.\n\n>I'm more interested in affecting positive social change on a large scale than I am in a police state.\n\n100% agreed.  Just keep in mind, the vast majority of us want this too.  The Boards platform can be a scary place, but it's an interesting exercise to consider the mechanics of this community in comparison to desire thereof.  All things considered there is very little player-player interaction happening right now that reinforces the community and makes us stronger as a whole, and it's fascinating to consider whether this might be due to people feeling unsafe or feeling unwelcome.\n\n>We should also be open to the concept of evaluating things like the Universal Rules from time to time.\n\nDefinitely.

However, I also believe that certain tools can still be used as a catalyst for that change to occur at a faster rate, and more smoothly overall.

I admit in the last year (15-16 months) it has seemed that Riot has done a worse and worse job communicating (as Riot has admitted). This has lead to a more toxic community over all. (Less feedback from Riot leads to anger from the forums/reddit/ect... and this drives more more Rioters away from the forums and this increases more anger from the community ect...)\n\nI guess, if I understand you correctly, shouldn't Riot be working on communication more than anything else?","replies":[{"poster":"Daen","date":"2015-03-30T21:54:25.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Are you saying, and I could just be reading into it, that Rioters are scared/afraid of negative feedback/reactions from the boards?\n\nYes.  Numerous Rioters have outright said that they are scared to post on the Boards, especially in GD.\n\n> (Less feedback from Riot leads to anger from the forums/reddit/ect... and this drives more more Rioters away from the forums and this increases more anger from the community ect...)\n\nThis is an interesting point, and it's pretty complicated to resolve.  It's a vicious cycle until reaching a certain equilibrium of interaction, and there are tons of other factors like socialization tools and community management that play into it.  \n\nTo me it's a pretty significant problem that so many people's perception of this community is that it's meant to facilitate player <-> Riot interaction.  That is *not* a healthy community, and the fact everything is so segmented really isn't helping anything.  General Discussion is the only board that really even feels like a community rather than just a series of messages, and it's pretty much all based on a foundation of minor trolling.","replies":[{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-03-30T22:06:45.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well here's the thing. If Riot wants a less toxic community, then they have to put forth the first step. I know it sounds like I am blaming Riot, but the thing is they are ONE entity.

That makes it next to impossible for the forum goes to change their culture unless there is a HUGE cultural shift on Riot's end. \n\nTake what happened this past holiday. There were a LOT of posts about Riot and a lack of communication. (Right or not, these posts were everywhere so there had to be some bit of truth to them) Then Rioters such as Ghostcrawler can on and basically said \"sorry it was the holiday but we will do better, that is one of our major goals\". However outside of GD this has not happened, and one could argue the lack of communication has gotten worse.\n\ntl;dr   If Riot wishes to change the culture they have to put forward the first major effort.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tortferngatr","date":"2015-03-30T21:27:28.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm.
