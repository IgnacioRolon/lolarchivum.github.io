Can you explain your thought process so I can better understand?\n\nSejuani had a phase during her rework where they added a self slow to her W, and everyone said it was bad so Riot straight removed it. Everyone complained about Rammus self slow, and still are and Riot did nothing about it. They pigeon holed him jungle and he is having a bad time. I used to play Rammus top lane to counter AD heavy top bruiser, i can't any longer, the defense come to the price of 60% slow, and i can't farm minions or use it defensively while running back to my turret without ending like a walking duck. The slow need to be toned down or straight removed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Junglerz Fault","date":"2017-06-24T16:33:31.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rammus isn't in a great spot now.
