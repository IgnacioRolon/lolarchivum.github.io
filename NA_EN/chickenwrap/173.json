Like, I know he used to be an early-game god, but Riot changed around his entire window of viability. \r\n\r\n- Passive that scales as he levels, dealing almost no bonus damage at first and still quite paltry since it _stops at level 11 and still is only half a crit of damage_\r\n- Stealth that lasts so short that you can&#039;t even gank with it until it&#039;s level 2 (scales up to being longer than original Deceive at level 5)\r\n- Only has one AD ratio on his entire kit (His E) \r\n- All his damage from leveling up skills is horrendous. +15 on Q, +30 on E.\r\n- His Clone only does damage if Shaco has lots of AD.\r\n\r\nShaco is literally the be-all and end-all of scaling assassins. He simply doesn&#039;t _do_ anything until he has a lot of items. His entire kit is utility with zero damage attached to it in the form of numbers, but in added percentages where having 0 AD makes you useless.\r\n\r\n_But people keep arguing with me that I&#039;ve been playing this champion for years and years and don&#039;t know how he functions and that he&#039;s always been and always will be an early-game champion when he can&#039;t even fight off people who invade him, he can&#039;t invade others, tanks kill him with ease, and he can&#039;t reliably gank until his Q is level 3_","replies":[]}
