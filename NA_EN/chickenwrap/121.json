These are some of the results we&#039;ve experienced.\n---\n**The Angry Zed-hater**\nHave cc immunity: catching zed couldn&#039;t be more important! Technically everytime he ults, it actually lacks counterplay ( cooldown doesn&#039;t count) but that&#039;s because we&#039;re just straight up terrible players. Edit: 420upvote hype. I just thought the enemy twitch was fucking obnoxiously snowbally and unnecessarily stupid. Edit: seriously people arguing over advice is not needed, especially when korean pro builds still use spellvamp.\n\n**TORNADO STATUS GODYR**\nThis thread has buffed godyr to tornado status. Smite chickens and click damage away with your duskblade... Remind you of someone kappa? Removing dfg for being mandatory on yasuo has basically ruined the current jungle scaling. health regen is still not efficient. as a diamond player, wowowowow that sleepy bubble is just unimaginably frustrating because we&#039;re just trying to hide under taric&#039;s cookie, and then 1shot out of nowhere! Refund my points @riot ( assuming you didn&#039;t just spend my money on morello&#039;s noodles).\n\n**@Obama, Nerf Juggernauts**\nThe damage output of these juggernauts are getting retarded mordekaiser seems great for those cheesy plants and click damage that would explain how powerful adcs are getting. Anyway @ironstylus @morello @obama this game is horrible again!! Upvote me if you&#039;re a really shocked melee dps that would like playing zed mid lane ( except rageblade is really complicated )\n\n**ADCs are Weak, and It&#039;s Reinboom&#039;s Fault.**\nThis season is pretty reasonable for yasuo, because his shield generation is only useful during everything. Arguably they could have rerolled someone who doesn&#039;t self heal for 100/115/130/145/160(+40 %) max hp, but that&#039;s probably stupid tbh and I feel like adcs are in a shit outta luck position in terms of raw stats and more than deserving of some well earned juggernaut items. Having players who are actually capable of balancing those cheesy plants would make kateykhaos walk through a minefield explaining that she is quite possibly 100 % on the radar for everyone who plays adc to be stronger with these changes. This means that if anyone cares that players want 3 refunds per season before they finish off riot reinboom, it&#039;s her. \n\nedit:  thanks for hearing me out that this mechanic has been nerfed to the ground ( e.g. Zoe really was busted, like biscuits with corrupted cookie jars ) \n\n**I started in Preseason 6**\nNot to be a limp noodle,  but there&#039;s no tinfoil that is large enough to compete against assassin mains when it comes to keeping sejuani absurd right now. Preseason 6 was when I started playing and I feel like I didn&#039;t die from melee attacks post flash ult ( if it had more counterplay ). Nami bruiser on - hit builds could easily be addressed because designers are people too. Everything needs to be nerfed except for morde and my main. I think this balancing is the duty of the people who play League. \n\nEdit: ~~i know what your favouritism towards riven w is. Remove everything on their kit completely. \n---\nSounds just like a Gameplay post, doesn&#039;t it?","replies":[]}
