It&#039;s just so obvious that it pales in comparison to Cookies and Cream and the polls prove it. This is what the public wants and you should just give in and give up now. Don&#039;t make a fuss, don&#039;t cause a riot, just give in and admit that Cookies and Cream is the superior flavour so we can kick out people who like lesser flavours (such as mint) from our boards.\n\n\\#MakeIceCreamGreatAgain","replies":[]}
