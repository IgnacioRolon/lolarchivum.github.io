Thanks Riot.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":6,"down_votes":16,"body":"Shaco&#039;s win rate has fallen to 51%. You may say to me: &quot;Chicken, that&#039;s not so bad!&quot; But when you look at the graphs\n\n( http://champion.gg/champion/Shaco/Jungle ) and take into account that the people keeping it higher are the Shaco mains themselves, then we might run into a problem. Shaco has a sub-50% win rate for _well_ over half the game and only has a positive win-rate when everyone is max build.\n\nBy having a feast-or-famine champion who scales only with gold deal no damage in the early or mid parts of the game, you&#039;re causing a huge problem. Shaco can no longer reliably be picked to do his primary job, and Bruiser Shaco has become the norm because it&#039;s the _only_ way he can even think of keeping up with other champions. He&#039;s one of the weakest champions in the game right now when his job is to be a ganking, invading, and assassinating Jungler. \n\nHe can&#039;t invade, he can&#039;t really protect himself if _he&#039;s_ invaded, he can&#039;t gank reliably until 4 (and even then, he has no damage so most of the damage will be provided by the person he&#039;s ganking for. You&#039;d better hope they have CC too, otherwise you&#039;re just wasting your time unless the enemy is on top of your turret.\n\nAs for assassination? There&#039;s a reason he&#039;s being played as a Bruiser now. More of a utility-damage pseudo-tank pick because he simply can&#039;t compare with his competition. \n\nBy giving Shaco a kit that does nothing but offer utility and scale with his items, Shaco has been forced out of his primary role and with the recent changes by _completely removing Deceive&#039;s damage and upping its CD by a few seconds_ and making it so he always cries with Backstab as if he were _level five_, not only did Riot succeed in finally removing AD Shaco, but also in nerfing AP Shaco&#039;s burst as well, turning him into somewhat of a sustained-fighter, which is _bad_ because Shaco can&#039;t _do_ that very well unless he&#039;s...\n\n_Built as a Bruiser._\n\nRiot turned Shaco into a Bruiser, and then nerfed every way he could be built, including as a Bruiser.\n\nShaco is now in a worse state than he was before his rework, and that&#039;s not OK. I hope and pray that Riot will see their error and fix Shaco in the upcoming patches.\n\nThe only reason I stuck around to play League has been officially removed from the game. I know those of you who didn't want to play around obvious stealth mechanics are happy, but I, and some other Shaco players, feel extremely cheated by this, since it honestly was the reason we kept coming back to play League. Unless I can find something else to fill the void, I might finally be out.","replies":[]}
