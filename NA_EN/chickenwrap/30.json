You created a male character that does not play into the male power fantasy as much as it plays into the female power fantasy. \r\n\r\nI demand you change New Taric in ways that make the male power fantasy continue to trump the female one, because if females have nothing to complain about in video-games displaying good-looking male and female characters whom both play into only one power fantasy (the dominating male one), we&#039;re going to have a serious problem on our hands.\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to read my concern,\r\n\r\nChickenWrap","replies":[]}
