What happened?\"","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":87,"down_votes":87,"body":"The short version is that we didn't get along on a few things and they thought I was a detriment to the program.\n\nWe often argued over both mod and non-mod related topics and in the end it was decided that I should leave. \n\nI only harbour ill will to like, half of the mod team because I don't like them and that's fine. \n\nI became a member of the mod team because I wanted to see GD flourish, but in my opinion, the wrong people were allowed access to GD to make removals and so there wasn't a whole lot I could do from that perspective, and I apologize that I was unable to help GD for the better in this regard.\n\nWith that in mind, I have faith that Jikker and Eva will be able to continue to help everyone as best they possibly can as far as they are allowed to do so.\n\nAnd to the mods and specialists I know are talking about me and this post behind my back, I see you. To everyone else, I enjoyed my time working with you. Please don't delete my shitposts so people will think I still have #modprivilege even though that has literally never existed.","replies":[]}
