They&#039;re using it as a way to spread hate, and isn&#039;t this what every minority group dislikes about racism? Using it as a means to spread hate against someone else?\r\n\r\nHypocrisy isn&#039;t the way to equality.\r\n\r\n&quot;White people&quot; memes are popular, and they&#039;re also racist, and you can bet that people making &quot;Black people&quot; or &quot;Hispanic people&quot; memes are getting flak for it. Why is this behaviour not frowned upon? Why is turning the anti-racism movement on its head and being racist towards different groups of people seen as OK?\r\n\r\nYou _can_ be racist towards White people, by the way. I know a lot of people say that the definition of racism has changed (it hasn&#039;t) to mean that the only race you can&#039;t be racist to is the White one &quot;because they&#039;re never been oppressed before by non-Whites&quot; but that&#039;s simply not true, as Whites were the original slave race and were sold as slaves in Africa.\r\n\r\nSo let&#039;s discuss: Why is it deemed socially acceptable to be racist towards White people, and do you think this helps or hinders the anti-racism campaign?","replies":[]}
