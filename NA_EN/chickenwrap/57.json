I have seen a Sylas with 437 HP jump up to 1108 HP with 99 AP because of that base ratio (and you do max this spell first)\n\n3) Three dashes, one of which gives a shield (for 90% of your AP for 2 seconds) and then allows you to _Camille your ass into the enemy and STUN THEM INTO A KNOCK-UP_.\n\n4) Passive that grants him all sorts of bonus damage able to be procced after every single spell. 20% AP ratio on a melee champion that sits on top of you. Full combo rotation without ult and your passive deals another 80% in damage, but this one honestly isn&#039;t _so_ bad.\n\n5) Doesn&#039;t even have an ult in this kit, he can take whatever he wants. It&#039;s like his entire kit was built without an ultimate in mind so it functions hyper well _without an ultimate_, so _god forbid he actually picks one up._ Top tier memes.\n\nGood thing he&#039;s an AP assassin with a bruiser kit that can abuse all his crazy high damage, mobility, and self-sustain to smash through every single person on the enemy team while remaining entirely healthy. We haven&#039;t seen any problems there before, ever.\n\nHe&#039;s basically current Galio but worse. How did this happen?","replies":[]}
