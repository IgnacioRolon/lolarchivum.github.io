Let's try this being nice to them thing again.\n\n---\n\nYou've had your fun, it's time to dial it back and let GD be GD again please.\n\nThis isn't what we're used to, nor what we want, judging by the public out-cry that's happening right now. I know what you did you did in good faith, but it wasn't received well from the get-go, so maybe it's time to just let GD revert to being GD again.\n\nYes, [Censored] are a topic of discussion on GD right now. Some people like them, some don't, but at the end of the day, they're not breaking the rules. They're fair game, and nobody should be permabanned for posting drawings of younger girls as long as they're not sexual in nature -- right? Great. Why? Because they're not provocative and they're not even PG-13. I see and interact with my sister every day. There's nothing wrong with that, is there?\n\nI suggest you also get some sort of Riot-sanctioned \"Moderator\" (the name of the account) account that can be used to post on these forums where you can make a thread and explain why people are being banned left and right, because a lot of people don't know.\n\nAlso, permabanning isn't the answer to someone being mean. Content removal, sure. A day ban? Whatever. Permaban? Seriously? You're off your rocker. Also, please try to tone back on the hypocrisy and the removal of content without actually paying attention to the body of the post.\n\nThis thread that you've deleted once already with the reason of:\nhttp://puu.sh/hAS6k/869a06e3ac.png\n\nIs not actually, y'know, doing that, This isn't content that is extremely offensive to users. I never posted a single picture, I merely said a word that is best defined as \"Young girl\" by GD (based on what I've seen posted). No sexual themes? No content removal, you weird, weird person. Now, if people on GD were associating [Censored] with pornographic materials, then we would have a problem, but they're not. Please look at the full picture next time. Now, if we could get a nice discussion going here again instead of another removal based on the simple use of a word, that would be lovely.\n\nPlease just take a step back and actually assess what you're doing before you continue with this any further. Thank you.","replies":[]}
