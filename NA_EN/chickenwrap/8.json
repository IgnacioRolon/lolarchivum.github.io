I can't tell you when I'll be back or how I'll get to where I want to go, but I suppose I'll become a better person for it. \r\n\r\nAfter upsetting my angry landlady, she has called the police and I will be forcibly removed at the above time if I am not already gone. None of the places I can find right now are taking  tenant's right away and most of my friends live halfway across the country. \r\n\r\nPerhaps I shall take my limited funds and hop on a plane to meet them? Nobody knows for now, but hopefully this journey sees me well and not lying on the streets. \r\n\r\nI wish I had more money than I do but it would appear that I am just not in that sort of position right now. I've been awake for 32 hours now, and I hope that I can make these funds stretch out until I can find a place (gotta love having to pay student loans at the same time!). \r\n\r\nIn regards to my job? I can't sleep there. I can barely even work there right now with my leg in its condition. I can't rely on that as a source of income.\r\n\r\nSo when I leave, GD, I want you to know that I love you guys. Have a great night.","replies":[]}
