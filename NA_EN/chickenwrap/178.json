What&#039;s worse about this is if the AP ratio included in the Backstab works with +Crit damage through Infinity Edge, we&#039;re going to see full AP Shaco&#039;s with IE again.\r\n\r\nRiot, what are you doing. This isn&#039;t the way to change Shaco. You&#039;re going to destroy _everything._","replies":[]}
