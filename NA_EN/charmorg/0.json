{"poster":"Charmorg","date":"2017-02-11T20:31:51.648+0000","title":"Ban","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"Hey, I know this is a long shot but I was really rudely helped through the actual support mechanism, so I&#039;m trying to see if I can get a rioter to publicly answer some of my questions regarding my account.\r\n\r\nMy account was permanently banned recently for being overly abrasive and toxic. While I do not, and never have, dispute the validity of considering the games referenced abrasive, I dispute the entire process.\r\n\r\nI play a large number of games on League of Legends, and see people being similarly toxic. In fact, I am friends with some of them (they make a small portion of my friends list). For some reason, they are still allowed to be playing league, while they have more toxic games as a percent of total games. Has Riot even considered looking at this as a metric of how &quot;toxic&quot; a player is?\r\n\r\nMultiple other people have had rioters confirm their escalation went through multiple 14 day bans, and &quot;manual time ban&quot;s before getting a permanent ban. Why was it that someone decided to skip that escalation for me, when my toxicity was by far not as common or horrid as some people who still have accounts on the game?\r\n\r\nThe instant feedback system is referenced as a way to explain reports and bans, however the feedback is not provided until after punishment has been issued. Why is it that there is no true &quot;instant&quot; feedback (after leaving end of game screen) that would say &quot;you were reported by X number of people, here&#039;s the chat log from that game, please look it over and try to improve before your next game&quot;? If this were implemented as a true instant feedback system, I can guarantee that it would help myself and other toxic players who are only situationally toxic (stressful day, bad news during a game, etc) notice their decline in sportsmanship and improve before playing more games, or even just stop playing for a time altogether. The current &quot;instant feedback&quot; is hardly instant and does nothing to help long term players recognize their behavior until it&#039;s too late.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I disagree with the fact that there is never a conversation with a player before issuing any punishment. The first time a player is informed that they have been overly toxic is when they get a punishment. A player has no idea before the punishment is issued that they&#039;re being toxic. This would be mitigated by having true &quot;instant&quot; feedback, but an alternative would be for a rioter, before issuing manual suspensions, to issue a temporary suspension until a conversation has been had with a player, they completely understand the situation, and can discuss ways they will behave in the future. There is no reason that people should be getting banned with no communication prior other than prior punishment.\r\n\r\nJust my two cents, and I fully understand that this likely won&#039;t result in my account getting a final chance, but if a Rioter sees this and implements some of these ideas and it helps just one other person avoid the same fate, it&#039;s worth it.\r\n\r\n-Charmorg","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-02-11T20:41:00.550+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you post your chat logs we may be able to help answer some of your questions.\n\nAll of the punishments before a permanent suspension are warnings that your behavior is not tolerated in league. They are typically handed out minutes after the game that triggered your review. (I have heard 5-15) \n\nManual reviews are typically only done randomly to verify the system's integrity and for out of the ordinary cases, such as players who are consistently reported but are not punished such as when it is something that the system is not yet equipped to handle to my knowledge.","replies":[{"poster":"Charmorg","date":"2017-02-11T20:49:12.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't dispute the logs, and I don't want to post them at this time, as I stated I don't believe that my account will ever get un-suspended (although it would be a nice outcome).\n\nThis was more of a post to question Riot as to why the features I mention haven't been implemented, as I believe the features I request would greatly help people who genuinely want to not be toxic do so.\n\n\"All of the punishments before a permanent suspension\" happen months to years before the perma. It doesn't make sense to consider it \"instant feedback\" when all that happens is \"instant punishment\". The system needs renamed or needs to be updated to provide instant chat-logs (after players have left end of game so they cannot retaliate) so players can use the feedback to improve their future games.

No, the warning to players that are behaving poorly is the chat restrictions and 14-day ban. That's the instant feedback since it often happens on the final game that pushes their standing into the un-acceptable.","replies":[{"poster":"Charmorg","date":"2017-02-12T06:16:37.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see how it can be a waste of time when a computer could easily do it.

The conduct is \"unacceptable\" to my understanding every time it occurs, I am advocating that people be aware when others are considering their conduct reportable, before it gets to the point of a punishment.\n\nAlso, that's the point: \"these players could maintain their behavior and never get punished\". Yes, that's my goal. A player can see the instant feedback and either rectify whatever's making them toxic at the time, and/or stop playing until they calm down. Wouldn't that be such a better system than allowing players to go 3-4 or even more games before punishing them?","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2017-02-12T06:58:04.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They had previously implemented what you're suggesting.
