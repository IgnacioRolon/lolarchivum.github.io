I didn't expect it to be half the size of League itself. I'm irritated because my friends wanted to play League with me today, but, after literally playing with them yesterday, I have to download a patch 20 times the size of theirs. I've done nothing to League's files, and I have no custom skins/soundpacks or anything installed. I am super irritated. Can anyone help me out, or should I just let the patch download?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-27T23:15:25.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you were already at 7.14 then that 4gb is just a [visual display issue](https://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion-en/AdF7xEup-patch-715-size?comment=0000).
