Jinx has 2 figures and is getting a minifig in a Star Guardian set from what I read about soon.\r\n http://comicbook.com/gaming/2017/08/11/new-league-of-legends-star-guardian-figures-releasing-in-septemb/\r\n Lately the only champs who seem to be getting merch are eather: \r\nA) Reworked champs\r\nB) Popular champs\r\nC) Champs with big new skins\r\n\r\nAnd god forbid if they fall under 2-3 of those categories, cause then they are likely to get multiple stuff in the merch store. Hell, the &quot;reworked&quot; thing is situational at best considering MOST of the reworked champs haven&#039;t actually gotten any merch. Only VGU champs that have gotten a figure to my knowledge are {{champion:78}} and {{champion:18}} ({{champion:41}} also has one, but it was from before his VGU). Where is the merch for champs like {{champion:62}}, {{champion:14}}, {{champion:82}}, {{champion:421}}, {{champion:3}} and {{champion:101}}?
