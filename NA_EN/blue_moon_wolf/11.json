I think Shen is the community's choice for TD DJ, had Yasuo not filled that role. I think it would have been a fun exploration of his personality OUTSIDE of \"following my dad's footsteps, maintaining balance and tradition, and having no fun ever\", especially with him being fleshed out in canon lore via the Zed comic. I think people would have been way less unhappy with Shen receiving a TD skin even so close to Infernal being released than they are with Yasuo receiving a TD skin after Battle Boss (especially considering that Akali got her TD skin three months after PROJECT, but whatever). To me, Yasuo's whole presence in TD makes no sense. I've elaborated on that elsewhere, but he just has no personality. Hell, even THAT would have been more fitting for Shen than for Yasuo.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Placentas","date":"2019-11-30T21:36:27.275+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Late reply but whoah, DJ Rumble would actually be so cool!

Yasuo isn't a spring chicken himself and Jayce definitely in his late 20s to early 30s yet they gave him an academy skin rather then making him a professor (which could have fit as he would be the \"attractive male teacher\"). Skins can be done in a way that they make the champ feel younger.\n\nOverall they did have options, but the main point is it says that what champs needed skins was something they considered and no matter how you look at it, he JUST got a skin not even half a year ago. That should have been a HUGE factor against him getting a skin with them knowing how much people dislike champs getting skins that quickly. \n\nEven if he fit the best thematically, there are champs who needed the skin who would have worked almost as well thematically who at least have gone longer without a skin (hell if they swapped Senna with the new champ coming, they could have had a perfect \"silent producer\" and Senna would have made for a neat Nightbringer skin).

At best, I think Zed might've been a cool DJ, but there's no real significance between him and Yasuo, except that Yas is a bit less murdery. \n\nWere there options, maybe, but I don't think there are nearly as many as people are claiming here. At this point, it devolves into whether we think ham-fisting a champion into a concept is more important than space between Skin releases. If a theme resonates well enough, it's worth throwing another one out earlier than you might've, maybe push out the next one further back to compensate. Does it suck for some? Probably, but I prefer Quality over Quantity. \n\nI'm not going to get into 'What ifs'. If Aphelios was released right before Worlds like Senna was, and Yasuo still got the Silent DJ, I'd have a problem. Fact of the matter is though, Aphelios didn't line up with Worlds like Senna, and nothing's going to change that, so it's not a valid point.","replies":[{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2019-11-30T22:28:01.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Probably, but I prefer Quality over Quantity.\n\nThere's nothing about this that is quality over quantity aside from who gets more skins. the skins would have come out the same quality level weather {{champion:157}} got it or if {{champion:5}} got it. There is no defending them saying they considered champs with fewer skins when 2 champs quite literally just got skins not even half a year ago. weather or not they fit the best, that should have been a MUCH bigger factor with their skins being so recent. With this set up we can honestly throw any sort of \"cooldown\" on how long a champ needs to wait between skins as a popular champ will be able to get skins back to back. \n\nWhere is the line? At the end of the day, there NEEDS to be a limit as to how many skins a popular champ can get in a certain time frame, otherwise every skin release may as well be {{champion:81}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:145}} every time without anything for any other champ. I understand the concept. Popular champs make more money so need to make more for them. It's not rocket science, but there's a fine line between \"we NEED to do this for profit\" and \"we WANT to do this for cause we're greedy\". Riot flirts with this line way too often.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"notkai","date":"2019-11-29T22:52:25.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Academy Kayn,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=7PuOmJwm,comment-id=000d,timestamp=2019-11-29T19:06:44.898+0000)\n>\n> Does no one know what synthesize mean? \n> \n> For the consideration of who needs a new skin, Yasuo probably rated low on the scale. For other factors, Yasuo likely would've rated higher, along with the other champions. You'll see a similar issue with Dunkmaster Ivern, someone who needed a skin, but maybe didn't fit the theme all the way, though I think his personality works for it (his kit doesn't.) They're not a checklist to mark all of them off with, they're just considerations. \n> \n> As much as people say Shen could've fit, in my personal opinion, I don't really see Shen as a hip-hop kinda guy. Hell, his entire thing is about *sticking* to Tradition, which I know skins aren't supposed to stick to champions complete roots, that's just my personal reasoning. Both of them are pretty stoic, and I'm pretty sure Shen is Zed's age, but dang he feels like a Dad.\n\nNew skin idea: Dad Shen","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2019-11-29T19:49:19.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At least it's not as bad as the bastardization of \"meme.\"\n\n> 1 : **an idea, behavior, style, or usage that spreads from person to person within a culture**\n> *Memes (discrete units of knowledge, gossip, jokes and so on) are to culture what genes are to life.
