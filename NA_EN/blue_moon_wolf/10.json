Giving Viktor full control over Ionia and creating Neo-Ionia from the PROJECT: Overdrive cinematic.\n\nThen later, the PROJECT skins come into existence. Launching a rebellion against Viktor and his creations. After that, the Programs come about, as showcased by their full android-ness, compared to the PROJECT fusion of humans and tech. Then, after THAT, is where we reach Pulsefire-- officially the furthest point in that skin's universe's lore. Although it isn't specified if Pulsefire originates from the Evolution Timeline (BC, Mecha, PROJECT), we can infer from the tech shown by Cait and Ez that it is the farthest point in any timeline, with only Program coming close to it, but still fairly far away. Besides, the Program and PROJECT skins have nothing to do with each other. Dreadnova seems like it'd be the furthest, but I think it's just an alternate universe point where we are in the current League continuity.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"devdev463","date":"2017-09-05T14:04:25.098+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doubt riot will make many kayn skins tbh.
