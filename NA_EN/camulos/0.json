Also make sure it's detailed in all the things you have tried already so they can narrow down what needs to happen. Good luck :) \n\nRiot Support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}}","replies":[{"poster":"Camulos","date":"2015-11-13T00:07:47.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks GoldPikaKnight,\nI actually already did this, but it said that the response would take a while due to a high amount of requests, so I thought I'd post something here in the meantime to see if this has happened to anyone before and if they knew the fix. It doesn't seem to be a very common problem though...\nThanks for your help anyway mate!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cawk Deezil","date":"2015-11-13T11:39:30.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was having an issue connecting, then I notice one of their trouble shooting suggestions was to check the TLS 1.0 security protocol in advanced settings on Internet Explorer.....however I NEVER use Internet Explorer, but I said what the heck....To my surprise I couldn't even connect to the web with IE (must've been some update to it that changed settings )but TLS 1.0 was already checked. \n\nThrough my great wisdom, I decided to just reset IE to default settings, and well....it worked....\n\nTL/DR;\nReset IE to default settings through advance options menu on Internet Explorer browser, and see if that helps.","replies":[]}]}
