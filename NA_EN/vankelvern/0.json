I've spent many hours downloading only to reach 10%. After doing some reading about other with this issue, I have tried closing and re-opening as admin, which seems to be worse.\r\n\r\nAs I'm typing this my download speed is dropped to 65 kbps and dropping. On speed-test my internet currently achieves a 35 Mbps download speed.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody have any tips on how I can get this downloaded with less than 24 hours of PC runtime?\r\n\r\nThanks guys","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-01T21:38:41.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm you might be able to bump up your download speeds a bit by switching to a hardwired connection, but if that isn't possible let's also make sure to double check your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). Something might be configured a little odd for League, so make sure to check those and let me know if nothing helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"whubalubadubdub","date":"2017-06-01T06:32:53.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it took me 8 hours to download and it looks like it'll take another 8 to patch :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stalker VPSI","date":"2017-06-01T06:23:31.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here, my speed-test it shows 50 Mbps download speed but yet for the league downloads (I haven't launched the client since 3/22/2017 btw) is at 73.7 Kbps and going down.....","replies":[]}]}
