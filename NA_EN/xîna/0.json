I started playing leauge in the end of Season 4 so Season 5 was my first ranked experience and after going 2/8 in placements i got placed in Bronze 3. I did understand that i was bad so i didnt really bother with it. Then season 6 rolls along and my skillcap was better and i did better overall in KDA and map awareness. I did my placements and went 9/1 and got placed in Bronze 5. Now this is whats bothering me.. I know that 50% of the NA players got placed in bronze, but not all bronze /silver people are bad and therefor gets placed lower than they should. Maybe if Riot told us how the ranking system works becasue i know for a fact that its not how many games you win or lose in placements that deside where you get placed.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-11-21T09:14:06.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They have said how ranked works... for the most.\n\nYou have your mmr where you started placements from season before. (i assume you were bronze or low silver end of last season?)\nThere's you starting basis. Now what they do with that mmr is at season start (or at the introduction of flex queue) they soft reset your mmr meaning it takes a hit. The only way you will place higher than where you ended is if you duo with someone higher than you.","replies":[{"poster":"Xîna","date":"2016-11-21T09:25:55.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I ended this season in Bronze 1 becasue i climbed up there.

It's largely based off the previous seasons MMR. You'll most likely be place in bronze 5-4.\n\nOn average you should expect about a whole tier drop from any tier. This is to accommodate all diamond + players having to place plat 1 at maximum. It varies of course.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
