It's getting worse as the patches keep going. Anytime I level up a skill, or sometimes when I use multiple skills it will have a small jitter on the screen, it's just quite annoying to deal with. Then every few seconds into the game I get a small stutters and it gets worse as the game goes on. It continues to get worse as time goes on and as more teamfights persist. Some games are better than others, but I ALWAYS get small stutters into the game no matter what. I have to check V-Sync if I even want to play the game AT ALL, because when it's not checked I cannot even run the game at 10 FPS with my system specs.. I can run ANY OTHER game fine, but as soon as I play league I start this stutter and lagging problem. I noticed that since the last Windows 10 update about 15-20 days ago, league also had 7.22 come out and it's been working terribly since. I reinstalled windows several times, reinstalled my drivers and updates, full repaired League, made sure every part in my motherboard was correctly plugged in..  I also noticed that It's not my internet connection, I pay for 1GB up and down and it's suppose to be partnered with League and Xbox to offer the most reliable and prominent internet experience. I even called the company to verify no problems from their ends.\r\n\r\nLast thing, League will work better once I do a full system restart AND a full repair to the League client. I play on HIGH because it has the SAME FPS even when I put it on LOW, It still has plenty of stutters, but at least I can play normals to get my league fixation. Because under these circumstances I cannot play ranked and I'd love to play this next season.. Like I have since season 1, Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-13T23:28:03.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mentioned that you can't run the game at all without V-sync turned on, but are you seeing any problems with it turned on? You may just need to have that option have to smooth out any stuttering.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VaJhina","date":"2017-12-19T13:38:09.539+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump, this has also been happening before the snowdown map, so it's not that either. I don't know what else to do, I promise you it's not on my end. There is ALOT of people complaining about this on the forums. Most of them having great specs and able to run the game 200 FPS+ before and now cannot run the game in teamfights past 20.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VaJhina","date":"2017-12-17T19:10:34.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"VaJhina","date":"2017-12-17T19:08:58.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, it still has stuttering but just less. I never had to have it on before, why the change now? I have ran league for the last two years on the same PC with no changes but after 7.22 it's been terrible. Every game works fine besides League. Many people are having this problem if you guys haven't checked your forums.. We need a fix because it's not on my end 100%","replies":[]}]}
