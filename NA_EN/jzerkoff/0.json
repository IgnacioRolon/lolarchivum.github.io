All the sales have been announced up until may 1st with no SG jinx going on sale.\r\n\r\n These early sales are the only time legendarys go on sale so people like me check the news almost daily waiting for them to come out. For them not even to come out?! wtf. That is false advertising. \r\n\r\nI haven't even played LoL in a month or two but you got me checking your news for something that didn't even come out.","replies":[{"poster":"EvilGen1us","date":"2017-04-28T07:13:04.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is on sale now bruh !! go go go 1350 RP","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-27T15:23:37.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know you're stoked to get your hands on Star Guardian Jinx, but April isn't over.  :/  Keep your eyes on the [Sales](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales) announcements, and hang tight!","replies":[]}]}
