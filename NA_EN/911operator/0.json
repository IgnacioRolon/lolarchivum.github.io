Ever since that change, my game has had odd freezing issues. E.g when in a teamfight, sometimes all particles disappear and all I see are champions teleporting around and randomly loosing health. This seems to happen at random and can be a minor issue some games, but other times it makes the game basically unplayable. I have these 'freezes' last anywhere from .5 seconds to up to 30 seconds (usually only in teamfights). Seems like its packet loss but not sure.\r\n \r\nThings that I've done:\r\nReinstalled LoL\r\nChanged my internet adapter (currently using a Linksys USB adapter)\r\nPlayed other multiplayer games (CS:GO, DoTA2, Warframe, Overwatch, PoE, TheDivision), all of which had no issues\r\n\r\nI'm not really tech-savvy, so I'm not really sure what else to do. I'm pretty sure the root cause is the switch in my internet provider but I would like any advice on troubleshooting and what not so I can actually play ranked again.\r\n\r\nP.S forgot to add I live in SoCal, Temecula to be exact. Also my FPS and ping are both stable, moreso than before the ISP switch.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n911operator","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-05T21:36:01.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're having some network issues holding strong comms with the game server, and might be experiencing packet loss.
