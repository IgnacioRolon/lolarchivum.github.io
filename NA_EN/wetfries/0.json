It's something called fiber optics and I feel that is part of the problem since I had no lag before. Some of my friends who live near me also have the same exact problem (they upgraded with the same provider and everything).  Before the upgrade, I would constantly get 44 ms every game, but now I get 44 ping some games and 165 constant ping in the others (ping doesn't change mid-game, whatever the ping is at the starting of the game is the same as the ending). There is about a 50% chance I get 44 ping in my games. It makes me no longer want to play this game, please help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-04T19:26:49.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your ISP adjustments could very wall have changed how it directs your network to our game servers.

It looks like your connection is taking a big hit as soon as it leaves your router.  You should hit up your ISP about this and show them these logs as proof of where their nodes are having latency problems.  You may have to contact a Tier 2 to read the logs.  Good luck!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
