The biggest reason that this happens is due to certain network settings locally that conflict with League. Our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) is a great place to address this because it covers the most common solutions for these misconfigurations. \n\nLet me know if those changes were able to resolve your issue.","replies":[]}]}
