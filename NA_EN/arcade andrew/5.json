Somewhat concerned, but she effectively had permaslow before (albeit with a mana cost), and this version starts with a lower base than the Live rank 1 15% slow, so there's probably a numbers-balanced version available.\n2. The 5 arrows per attack on her Q have their own AD ratio, something like .23/.24/.25/.26/.27 for a Total AD ratio of 1.15/1.20/1.25/1.30/1.35 per basic attack while it is active. They all apply the slow. Q is a spell with a somewhat long cooldown, so she can't just have it active forever.\n3. First of all, it's only very very marginally narrower. We increased the number of arrows and put better blocking gameplay in (by allowing enemies to get hit by several arrows, but only damaged by the first) so that opponents can better play against Volley.\n4. We've put power in several places with these Ashe changes, but that meant we had to take some out in others, and small bonus gold on kill isn't all that sexy, even if it does have some small wins attached to it.\n5. Hawkshot's base recharge time is very long (90 seconds at rank 1 and going down substantially with rank from there, I believe), because we also agree that this change is scary. But we also think it has the potential to be pretty darn cool. As she's tested on PBE and in her first few weeks on Live, we'll determine what these cooldown values should be in order to make sense, but ultimately, we thought this change really helped to emphasize Ashe's utility elements.\n\nHope this helps to answer your questions.\n\nCheers,\nRepertoir","replies":[{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2015-04-29T00:48:48.827+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sooooo...

She's still got decent waveclear if you W the minion wave first, though, because that applies the slow to everyone. W is nerfed overall, but Q  more than makes up for it. E is... nerfed if you consider the gold passive, but overall I consider it a buff, because the vision is a little better, and the passive made you very dependent on cs to access your full power budget. Basically, full build ashe is now more powerful but it takes longer to get there with cs alone. This makes you less dependent on csing perfectly, which is great - it makes her power easier to access.\n\n> According to Repertoir, BC stacks on each arrow of her empowered Q (though the multiple shots only work on the first shot for some things, like BotRK and Braum's passive, for obvious reasons, I think), so BC might be good, especially with the Phage passive, maybe in place of LW.

Ashe with a 5-stacks Q on a tower is almost as good, maybe better (because of her range), at tower-pushing than Jinx. Less reliable, because she needs an enemy minion wave to stack up on or she's just \"meh\" at it, but also safer, with more range.","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-04-30T05:27:03.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"(....just deleted my comment I was working on for about an hour.

I need a bit more practice utilizing it fully, but she still feels pretty strong even without it.\n\n*RE: CS, Kit, and Gold*\n\nI had a bit of trouble gauging the crit damage on my second shots for CS, messed a few up because of that, but that's just something to get used to, and is easier to get used to because no RNG. I didn't find the W block too significant; you just need to find different angles to fire from, which is sort of what I do on live Ashe since poking with W through minions isn't terribly reliable (or I'm just missing the secret). E was a buff for me, just because I constantly overestimate the range on it and end up just awkwardly walking around instead of firing the Hawkshot. She's losing a significant amount of gold, but a silver lining is that Avarice blade isn't as bad an early buy on her just because the crit chance = reliable damage for her now, and the guaranteed crits means Frenzy mastery is up constantly, meaning you can afford to wait a bit on buying AS. Her Q I still need more practice on using optimally, but overall I like it.\n\n*RE: Build and BC*\n\nSo my build path was BFSword > Avarice Blade > IE > Runaan's > Furor Zerker Greaves > BC > BT > SS. I had a chance to fiddle around with BotRK instead of BT, and PD over Runaan's, but not enough to make a definitive assessment, at least on the latter. I feel like the early Avarice Blade is situational, since it's still not a great item for laning, but you can rack up a good amount of gold just by keeping with you for the entire game, and with BFS her AD is pretty good so 10% crit on top of that is decent.\n\nStill undecided about the Runaan's; damage wise it's inferior to SS and PD, on single targets at least or especially, because no crit, plus no MS that she uses, but the bolts stack her Q so fast and, with BC, she can shred an entire team so quickly with her Q active. Plus it just looks cool :P.\n\nAlso kind of mixed about BC, over LW. She has less immediate burst but great sustained damage, so BC isn't terrible on her imo, but part of me still feels like ADCs rather have the up-front pen of LW, even if Ashe can stack it super fast. At the same time, though, BC has so many benefits, as you mentioned. Her ult CD felt so much shorter. I didn't think the Phage passive was as noticeable as Furor, but I guess when you have no mobility skills, you take every bit you can get :P. The extra HP is great though, coupled with the BT shield. I'm not sure if she wants more upfront offensive ability with the LW to make up for the fact she isn't getting crits up front, or if she synergizes better with the ramp up of BC, since her damage kind of ramps up in a fight as well. Maybe they're situational.\n\nSpeaking of BT vs BotRK, I feel like BT is superior, just because she's got more AD ratios. Maybe I'm just distracted because a bigger number pops up with BT, but stacking AD seems like the way to go, since Ashe doesn't really scale with on-hits as well as other ADCs. The other consideration, though, is that the active on BotRK does help her kite, so there's that. However, with my build, the attack speed on BotRK didn't really feel noticeable, because Runaan's.\n\n*RE: Towers*\n\nI just might have not been paying attention, but I almost felt like she was losing damage on towers with her Q, because towers have a lot of armor. Probably just my imagination, or seeing smaller numbers pop up on attacking towers, lol. She's still great in sieges between her range, poke, and vision control to watch for flanks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-04-29T10:35:56.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm well it will clearly be a nerf to targets who are immune to slows like Olaf with ult on or Master Yi with ult or any target with Morgana's black shield\nAs well they can't be slowed and as thus Ashe can't crit them at all\nThough there aren't that many champions who can be immune to slows so not that big of a deal I guess","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-04-29T13:31:10.505+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reading over the changes again, it says she crits on people affected by frost shot, not people who are slowed, so it might be different","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-04-29T14:32:34.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it is only Ashe's own slow which procs her passive crit thingy\nYou are right","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mountain Chaos","date":"2015-04-29T05:35:34.232+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've heard that Runaan's Hurricane applies the Q active to both of its bolts, resulting it possibly 15 arrows from a single attack. While that is very cool, I'm curious about how two math aspects of the Hurricane.\n\nFirst of all, how does a Runaan's Hurricane bolt interact with Ashe's new form of crit chance? Is it counted as bonus damage, and thus applied to each bolt, or is it counted as a guaranteed crit, and so ignored by the bolts because bolts cannot crit? If the former, that sounds both super cool and rather OP - if the latter, I still want to try building Runaan's to slow all my enemies.\n\nSecondly, how does the damage with the Q active interact with the Runaan's damage? Does the Q deal full damage on a Runaan's bolt (which I think comes out to something like 1.35 * AD at max level)? Or, does the Q's damage get sliced in half by the 50% damage reduction on a Runaan's bolt?  Once again, the former sounds awesome but super powerful. And if something more along the lines of the latter.... well, I still want to shoot 15 arrows with a single AA.","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-04-30T13:27:42.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I could tell, it seems like Runaans bolts do about half damage of Ashes autos, including half of the Q bolt damage.

Maybe they'll make her MS even slower than she already is. There will be some trade off for a permaslow that can't be stopped.\n\nIt's likely that Ashe will be a lower damage-dealing champion, with her power heavy in utility. This is already the case with her current kit, and should be even more so in her rework. Expect her damage to go down in some ways, without it being an overall nerf.\n\nAs for Hurricane, I doubt it will be built. Since she still scales with Crit (though, as bonus damage now), she'll likely still want to build {{item:3031}} {{item:3087}}. The bonus damage will probably favor ArPen too, potentially making {{item:3142}} a viable pick. Since she'll have a stacking mechanic, the new {{item:3071}} might also used. If she wants to stack hits toward her new Q passive, might as well stack %ArShred too? Maybe. Throw that in with the 20% CDR for more ult initiations...\n\nI'm looking forward to this.","replies":[{"poster":"Morbidmoronjell","date":"2015-04-28T21:15:14.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since she isn't able to crit, I think her damage her be lower overall, but more consistent with her damage buff to slowed champs.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-04-29T10:39:00.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her DPS would potentially remain close to the same I would think as long as she is able to keep her targets slowed that is\nThough of course she won't be getting any lucky crits or anything like that","replies":[]}]}]}]}
