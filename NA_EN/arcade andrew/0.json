He did amazing work, nailing so many takes so fast.  \nWe split the records to three days to try and save his voice-- but each day he was willing to push it further than was rational.  A total pro, he was quick to adjust to notes, totally in control of his instrument, and easy to work with.

The standard now will not stay the standard forever. The standard for a car from the 1960s in not the standard for a car in the current era. The standard for visual quality of films from the 1950s is no the standard for films nowadays. The framerates of video games in the 80s has a different standard from games in 2010. As the technology improves, the standard will goes up regardless of how you feel about it now. \n\nAs Riot continues to make new champs or update old ones with the new technology, the others champs made with the old tech WILL starts to fall behind in terms of visuals. Hell look at Pulsefire Ezreal, the 1st ultimate skin in the game & comparison to SG Udyr or DJ Sona That is a perfect example of how improvements in tech will make older things that were standard fall behind the new were things. As champ at the bottom of the visual bar now are brought up, older champs moves closer to the bottom. For a popular e-sports game like League, it's important that most champs are kept up-to-date with the current standard.\n\nI'm not saying Riot should go out & change every champ right now, but eventually each & every champ have to be updated.
