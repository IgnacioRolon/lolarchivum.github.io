This happens on Earth in places too, but not to the same extent as it does across Piltover.  So what is below sea level and what is above can vary.","replies":[{"poster":"Epicurus","date":"2018-03-28T00:23:44.916+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now that's interesting.\nFor ships to cross from one side of the other there would need to be quite an impressive contraption capable of lifting and lowering them.\nIs that what this is?\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/5/5b/Piltover_City_of_Progress.png/revision/latest?cb=20161120062435","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-03-28T00:32:14.490+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Epicurus,realm=OCE,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=uwHerngX,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2018-03-28T00:23:44.916+0000)\n>\n> Now that&#x27;s interesting.\n> For ships to cross from one side of the other there would need to be quite an impressive contraption capable of lifting and lowering them.\n> Is that what this is?\n> https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/5/5b/Piltover_City_of_Progress.png/revision/latest?cb=20161120062435\n\nI believe so, yes!","replies":[{"poster":"Epicurus","date":"2018-03-28T02:44:31.343+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder how such a machine would be powered?
