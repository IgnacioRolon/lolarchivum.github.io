I know people say play support and it's instant. It's not. Even if i chose support and fill I still wait 15 minutes for a game. It's really annoying cause I'll sit down with 2 hours to play but only get 1 game because with queue times I couldn't fit 2 games. It says some thing like EST 2:30, and I see it says actual 17:00.\nWhat is wrong with the queues?\na 15 minute queue, reset, 15 minutes, reset, 15 minutes, game, player declined, 5 minutes, game","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-18T02:34:32.417+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your account currently has a [**low priority queue**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714).

In your post you mentioned waiting 15 min then resetting the queue, that will not affect how many games you have left in the LPQ. In order to get those LPQ games out of the way, you'll have to wait through the LPQ and finish matches until the game limit has been played, which it looks like you've only got 5 games left.","replies":[{"poster":"Kavren2055","date":"2017-08-18T04:53:49.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know reseting the damn queue wont stop lpq.
