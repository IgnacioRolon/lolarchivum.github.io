She speaks of her people as if the issue is simply that they didn't support the war and regard her as a 'gun for hire' (good for nothing but murder) rather than a soldier (someone who risked their life for her country) - and neither of those are relevant to the fantasy. She doesn't blame them for looking down on her, since they haven't seen what she's seen - but that only serves to make her sound more reasonable (in the sense of \"mature\"), which further disassociates me from her being a \"wild girl\". Her love of fruit sounds like she's getting to enjoy the \"luxuries of home\" after a few hard years on rations; not \"holy crap I've not seen a fruit in 10 years this is like sex in my mouth compared to eating mutant-bug-flesh\". She has more quotes about survivor's guilt than she does about being a survivor. \n\nAll of this added-up just makes Kaisa feel like \"what if the Void attacked Shurima TODAY and Taliyah had to fight\" - that is to say, someone who's already old enough to make the decision to fight and who is confident enough to want to (and I say Taliyah because Taliyah is already the plucky/annoying optimistic, so I can easily imagine her transitioning into Kaisa after a few years of war).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HonestJohnTheCon","date":"2018-06-18T12:36:52.213+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:81}} Honestly?

I really like the raspy effect of his voice, his calm bordering on getting excited at the prospect of battle, and how his design does feel like some otherworldly warrior.\n\nThe rework Aatrox, who I know it's popular to dislike, I adore.  His teaser got me so hyped.  Seeing glimpses of a colossal demon-like warrior ripping through a battlefield, 1,000 to 1.  New Aatrox's personality seems more expressed through his actions than his genuinely somber and spiteful VO.  He gracefully and fluidly swings his heavy blade around, with a tight form, never losing control of it.  He walks calmly when not in battle, but pulls his sword to the ready at the sight of an opponent.  His voice does betray him a bit, but I think it's reflective of what he was like before he was betrayed by the aspects.  I like to think that before he was betrayed, he sought challenge.  Like Fiora, or Jax.  But now that he's been betrayed and broken, he seeks only death, and his once genuine search for strength has turned into rage and hostility.  \nHe takes his title as the world ender not as an evil force, but as vengeance against a world he sees as dead.

Mordekaiser is actually my SECOND champion I've ever played in League of Legends as well as he's one of those overlord archetype. Urgot is an UNDEAD CYBORG.

His obsession with making everything **perfect** is something that echoes a lot with me, since I'm a perfectionnist. How he takes everything slow, how meticulous he is in order to deliver the best of performances...I feel like it's the same when you're drawing. In terms of gameplay, he is one of the most satisfying champion to play. Everything feels impactful. Each shot is powerful. His **Deadly Flourish** is hard to land, but how delightful it is to root them from afar. His Ultimate is the icing on the cake. **Curtain Call **is a whole experience in itself. When you start channeling and shoot at very low ennemies, how satisfying it is to see them try to **dodge** your bullets,** protect** each other, only for them to **die** by your hands, securing an execute with your 4rth shot, sometimes surprising your opponents with your damage. Jhin claims to be perfection and beauty, and he is, in my eyes. His voice is one of the best in all League of Legends. Whispering to your hear, ordering his \"dancers\" ( aka your opponents ) around, laughing hysterically... I love how he can sound sweet for a moment and completly insane in the next. Jhin claims that he creates masterpieces out of his ruthless killing, and I claim that Riot created a masterpiece by creating Jhin.\n\n{{champion:497}} He intrigued me ever since his release, and his trailer made me like both him and {{champion:498}} . His design is something that attracted me to him, but I didn't know much about him. I didn't play support, so I had no idea how he felt like. Playing him is one of the most fun things out of all things in League of Legends. His mobility is something that felt fresh in comparison to Jhin. The kiting with him can be hilarious. I've stopped counting how many people chased me down only to lose me, even burning their {{summoner:4}} in the process. Engaging with Rakan can be very risky, but so rewarding when done right. I felt like I was some judge and that, as soon as I used The Quickness and Grand Entrance on someone, I actually **sentenced them to death**. Not only his engage potential is huge, but he can also save his teammates from dire situations. Finally, his character is hilarious. Some of my favorite voicelines are the ones used when he auto attacks at close range._ \"Slap!\"\n_ I love the fact that he's a loud and kinda silly charmer instead of a more cliched one.\n\n{{champion:498}} She's the first champion I started playing with, and the one that made me discover the ADC role. Like Rakan, her trailer made me like her because of her design, and god bless the music in that video. I found the concept of Vastayas very interesting, making me appreciate her more and more. Her kit forces you to be aware of your surroundings and of your positionning at all times, which is very useful. Your opponents might forget the two lonely feathers that are about to fade away and in an instant, they're rooted and you finish them with auto attacks. Using Bladecaller on unexpected champions that think they got away is downright satisfying and hilarious at the same time. Her ultimate can be a real lifesaver at times : dodging ultimates like {{champion:92}}'s or {{champion:51}}'s, dropping tower aggro when your HP is very low or even survive a dive. I love her interactions with Rakan, it's silly, sweet and I love listening to champions interacting with each other, so these two are just perfect.\n\n{{champion:39}} I never played Irelia before her rework. Her gameplay never appealed to me. However, as soon as her reworked was announced, I got interested. The trailer showed us some of her lore, and the artwork was gorgeous. When her teaser came out, I made up my mind : I wanted to try this champion out, even if I'm not used to playing bruisers. Her design is absolutly stunning. I'll go as far as say that she may be one of the most beautiful female champions in all League of Legends. Even though I struggled a bit the first times I played her, I could definitly say that this champion is both fun and satisfying to play. Her title, \"The Blade Dancer\", isn't for show : she litteraly dances everytime she attacks, be it an ability or an auto attack. She must be the most graceful champion in the game. Her animations are smooth, and she feels just so right to play. When you can successfully place your combo with her, you'll feel extremely powerful. Some might call her broken, and perhaps she is. Some might miss the old Irelia. But in my eyes, this rework is a success, and one of Riot's best rework so far.\n\n{{champion:142}} I heard many people say how cancer she is, complaining about how she could oneshot you. I began playing her only recently, and boy is she fun! I love how happy and excited she is. This champion is full of rainbows and unicorns and it's AWESOME. Her voicelines are adorable, and it's funny to hear her groan and complain whenever you miss your Paddle Star. Hitting someone with your Sleepy Trouble Bubble is a death sentence late game. Either you burst them down with your Paddle Star and your Portal Jump or a teammate kills them. Zoe might have a lot of damage but if you miss every spell, you're dead. Your E is your engage tool and your escape tool. Waste it, and you'll end up dying faster than you can think.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Im Not A Furry","date":"2018-06-19T17:27:18.709+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"...\n\n ... >_> \n\n<_<\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{champion:103}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2018-06-19T07:01:46.769+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:98}} A character who isn't good or evil.

All day, every day, monstrous creatures of the deep were hauled in for rendering in the butcheries that lined the waterfront. He found employment in a district known as Bloodharbor, as even the tide itself was not strong enough to wash away the red slick that ran constantly down its wooden slips.\n\nHe became well acquainted with the trade—both the gruesome work and meager paychecks. Over and over, Pyke watched heavy purses of gold being handed to captains and crews in exchange for the daunting carcasses that he and his fellows would hack into salable chunks. He became hungry for more than a few copper sprats in his pocket, and managed to talk his way onto a ship’s crew. Few individuals dared to hunt in the traditional Serpent Isles manner: launching themselves at their targets to secure tow-hooks with their bare hands, and beginning to butcher the creatures while they yet lived. Fearless and highly skilled in this regard, Pyke soon cut a name for himself as the best harpooner a golden kraken could buy. He knew meat was worth pennies compared to certain organs from the larger, more dangerous beasts… organs that needed to be harvested fresh.\n\nDepending on the difficulty of the hunt, each sea monster commanded its own price, and the most desired by Bilgewater traders was the jaull-fish. From its razor-toothed maw, priceless sacs of sapphilite were coveted across Runeterra for various sorcerous distillations, and a small flask of the glowing blue oil could pay for a ship and its crew ten times over. But it was while hunting with an untested captain that Pyke learned where a life of blood and guts would land him.\n\nDays into their journey, a huge jaull-fish breached, opening its maw wide to reveal rows of sapphilite sacs. Several harpoon lines secured the beast, and though it was far bigger and older than any he had encountered before, Pyke leapt into its mouth without hesitation.\n\nAs he set about his work, a deep vibration began to stir in the creature’s cavernous gullet. Roiling bubbles broke the ocean’s surface, and an entire pod of jaulls began to push against the tethered ship’s hull. The captain lost his nerve, and cut Pyke’s lifeline. The last thing the doomed harpooner saw before the beast’s jaws snapped shut was the look of horror on his crewmates’ faces, as they watched him being swallowed alive.\n\nBut this was not the end for Pyke.\n\nIn the deepest fathoms of the unknowable ocean, crushed by the titanic pressure, and still firmly trapped within the jaull’s mouth, he opened his eyes once more. There were blue lights everywhere, thousands of them, seemingly watching him. Tremulous echoes of something ancient and mysterious filled his brain, crushing his mind, showing him visions of all he had lost whilst others grew fat.\n\nA new hunger overtook Pyke, one for vengeance and retribution. He would fill the depths with the corpses of those who had wronged him.\n\nBack in Bilgewater, no one thought much of the killings at first—for so dangerous a place, the occasional red tide was nothing new. But weeks became months, and a pattern began to emerge. Captains from many ships were found carved up and left out for the dawn. Bar-room patrons whispered it was a supernatural killer, wronged at sea, gutting his way through the crew manifest of some damned ship called the Terror. Once a mark of respect and celebrity, the question “You a captain?” became a cause for alarm.\n\nSoon it was the caulkers, too, and the first mates, merchant officers, bankers… indeed, anyone associated with the bloody business of the slaughter docks. A new name went up on the bounty boards: a thousand krakens for the infamous Bloodharbor Ripper.\n\nDriven by memories twisted by the deep, Pyke has succeeded where many have failed—striking fear into the hearts of unscrupulous businessmen, killers, and seafaring scoundrels alike, even though no one can find any mention of a ship named the Terror ever docking in Bilgewater.\n\nA city that prides itself on hunting monsters now finds a monster hunting them, and Pyke has no intention of stopping.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyquiem","date":"2018-06-18T17:07:15.631+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:268}}  lonely,\n\n{{champion:136}} been taken advantage of,\n\n{{champion:7}} I cause ironic debates","replies":[]},{"poster":"M00ndanc3","date":"2018-06-18T17:02:53.056+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:31}} : True equality through his eyes and always a desire to use others to become something . . . more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"remakoro","date":"2018-06-18T16:49:26.646+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:17}} - Stoic and resilient.
