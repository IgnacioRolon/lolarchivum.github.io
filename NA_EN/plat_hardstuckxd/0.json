K/DA Ahri, on the other hand, is a k-pop music star _from a different k-pop band_ wearing a corset, tights, high heels, and _no jacket or shorts_. TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

For existing skins it does offer up a lot of variation in ideas, as if someone doesn't like something the original skin had in its design then they don't have to pick it up and can grab the variant. \n\nSeeing as they have adjusted the pricing for the 1350s at to become 742 if you own one since it is just a model change and a slightly lower price of 1001(?) for the Legendaries as they still have a bit more, I don't think it's nearly as bad as it was.

My only initial concern was the original pricing paradigm, but that's been corrected, so I give these skins my full support. I'm definitely getting the Miss Fortune one and probably the Lulu or Soraka one.\n\nI like the potential for the future that these have. There are things like new costumes and models for the KDA skins, new outfits for Pool Party (Speedo Taric and Speedo Graves are my #1 request), or something like a Penguin Master Bard that reuses the particles and effects from Snowday. Lots of great possibilities here.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Noor Sakata","date":"2018-11-09T12:50:10.259+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nah , they are pretty nice and I'll buy the, excited for the Lux one","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silvarspark","date":"2018-11-09T09:36:13.546+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Looking at Mooh-Alistar, Nami-Tee and Meowkai, you see how to do good pajama skins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2018-11-09T08:33:31.333+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/WcsFZjxV-star-guardian-pajama-party-splash\n\nMaybe if you convince yourself that nobody has anything nice to say about it, that's what you'll believe.\n\nBut it doesn't mean truly that nobody has anything nice to say to it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ballzyyy","date":"2018-11-09T08:13:44.755+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":6,"body":"Laziest design and worthless to buy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Goodest Boy","date":"2018-11-09T08:45:55.016+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"unfortunately, no. its not a joke. really really wish it was...","replies":[]},{"poster":"SexyStaph","date":"2018-11-12T19:45:26.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't mind Pajama skins but the fact that they're trying to tie them with Star Guardian skins is... meh :/ Also not a really big fan of onesies.\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-3}} \nI feel like this was made for people who play with their friends and have the SG skins, but wanted skins to match their all-nighters in league matches.\n{{sticker:sg-lulu}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeracadaVenom","date":"2018-11-10T01:42:15.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont like them at all, expecially because i play a lot of low play rate champions that could use some skins, like Ivern, Ornn, and Rek'Sai","replies":[]},{"poster":"SoraNoAgito","date":"2018-11-09T21:10:06.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really think that skins are a joke, there is a whole bunch of champions forgoten that they need adjust or rework , maybe a Diana Eclipse pair of skins","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2018-11-09T20:05:27.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soraka's adorable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2018-11-09T20:22:56.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think the splash art is cute and the skins are an interesting idea.
