The last time I afked was when I was in a custom with my bros and I needed to go eat dinner. The one before that was 3 days ago, when I had to go eat dinner. I still came back tho, and we actually still won that game. (LB carry op) I played about 5 games in between these games, without any actions of afk. \r\n\r\nSo, is there like a delay in which I get in Low Priority Queue? I'm just curious. \r\n\r\nP.S.- If and only if a rioter sees this, can I send you a ticket so that I can see what I did wrong?\r\n\r\nThanks, \r\nSilver II nub nub who mis-typed his summoner name,\r\nFootballOsyssey","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-01-16T11:12:28.388+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey everyone, and sorry for the late response.
