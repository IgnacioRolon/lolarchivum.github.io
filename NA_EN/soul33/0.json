The only exception here would be premades in Diamond, where the entire party would receive a loss as a result per our [Remake FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ).  Looking in your recent games, though, I don't see anything that resulted from being marked as a leaver or remake for you.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]}]}
