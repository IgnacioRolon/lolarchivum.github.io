Anyone know why?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am a level 20 with my main Sona.  Sona's mastery is 6, with almost 36,000 total points.  I recently played on Summoners Rift and have gotten multiple S ranks including S+ and S-.  I have played both Blind and Draft and on none of them have I gotten a chest.  On my profile it says I still can get 4 chests.  Is this a glitch? Will these be awarded later or is this because I'm mastery lvl 6?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-01T00:35:15.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're mastery level 6 on Sona, it means you've already earned at least one S-grade (S-, S or S+) with her in the past. You can only earn **one chest** per champion each season. The chest eligibility will reset before the new season starts, but it hasn't reset yet. This means you'll need to widen the pool of champs you're earning S-grades on or wait until the reset if you intend to only earn a chest on Sona.\n\nCheck out our [**Hextech Crafting Guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide) for more details, let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Hippie Shaco","date":"2016-12-01T03:30:29.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I played one champion and someone on my team got an S and I got a chest, does that mean that I cannot get another chest with the same champion?

If were playing X champion and got a chest due to a teammate getting an S, then you will get a chest for X champion and cannot get another chest with X champion, even if you get an S rank with them.","replies":[{"poster":"Hippie Shaco","date":"2016-12-01T03:53:39.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awww that sucks","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
