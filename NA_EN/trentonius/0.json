My computer is not a toaster, and I have Gigabit internet, hooked up through ethernet. That being said Challenger Nidalee gives me problems. whenever she casts a spell at the edge of fog of war (every time she ganks the spear) My frame rate drops to literal 0 for around 2 secs. so my champ sits there until the free spear lands and she jumps on me. This is excessively frustrating that because someone bought a skin they are getting a free pass on me with every gank. I&#039;m not blaming riot, I am just asking that it gets looked into.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-27T18:18:09.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello trentonius! \n\nThanks for the solid report!
