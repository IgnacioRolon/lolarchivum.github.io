Don't seem like I got hacked cuz no one is playing on my account.\nThe weird thing is , yesterday I was trying to login (on the website) on my account and tried all the regions.\nWhen I tried the Russian region I got in, but it wasnt my account. The username was different. My russion is under 0, but I noticed my mail address was also used for that player his account.\n\n(Today I also can't login anymore on the Russian region)\n\nIm trying to reach someone of riot since wednesday, but still no reaction.\n\nAre their other players with the same problem?\n\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-15T15:44:59.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds really weird if you got to an account on another region not belonging to you, unless it was mistakenly transferred there.
