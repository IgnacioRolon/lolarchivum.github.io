He&#039;s a med range adc, having 3 of 4 abilities scalewith AP/AD, Q being minor damage and &#039;reveals&#039;, W being an awkward escape, E being a powerful close-range ability, and ult being a powerful long range ability. \r\n\r\nFrom this I wonder, do I build straight AD? Do I go mix? Should I go slightly tank? Should I go glass? Can I burst? Am I DPS?","replies":[{"poster":"Zerenza","date":"2016-09-18T14:21:40.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would go Tri-Force+ Gunblade but ALWAYS get tri-force first since it's still his strongest item by far then you also want to get Sorc Shoes, after those two get Infinity edge and rapid fire cannon. Your last item should either be a Steraks or a Scimitar for survival and corki is a mid-game champion so your power spike once you have Tri-Force and Sorc shoes is honestly better than most, finally remember that he's an AD caster and is better off in mid lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bay B","date":"2016-09-18T14:09:55.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been debating with myself whether building slightly tank after Triforce would help benefit him since he's so vulnerable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2016-09-18T05:40:34.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's definitely pretty unique.  As someone who mained him in S2, he feels pretty natural but unless you grew up with him, he feels different than your standard marksman.  W has really long range, but it costs a ton of mana and can be interrupted.  Have to actually weave your Tri-Force procs in with autos, as opposed to Ezreal who can get them off Mystic Shot.  \n\nI've seen some interesting builds lately. Tri-Force into Gunblade being tops among them. You definitely can burst if you get ahead of the curve.","replies":[{"poster":"Dracocrash","date":"2016-09-18T07:56:29.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think taking the crit out of tri-force really hurt corkis late game.  \n\n But tear ludens best corki.\n \nstay back and shoot shoot shoot.\n\n(im compensating for ap kogmaw)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2016-09-18T07:33:35.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He just loves to stock up guns.\nBut yeah i played him too lately and i have to say that he is a lot weird, but not that outdated. His kit is all over the place but apparently that is his point so he can use the best skill in the best moment.","replies":[]}]}
