I clicked on my profile not knowing what to do, then clicked back on the loot tab.  The loot page was no longer frozen, however i had one less box and no foreseeable loot (could've possibly been a small amount of essence I suppose).  I was also notified last night that I had received a box for getting an S, although the box never deposited in my loot (could've been a bug because I don't recall seeing a chest was available).  I don't know if Riot members can look into that but I would appreciate any kind of help.  Thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-09T01:03:57.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went ahead and dug around your hextech crafting inventory. It looks like the chest did open correctly, and you got the Snowblower Icon and 150 orange essence. Sometimes the icons can be a little confusing since they never appear in your loot similar to the champion shard rerolls. Also, as far as I can see, it looks like you have gotten all the chests you were supposed to!\n\nHit me back up if anything else looks weird!","replies":[{"poster":"bujuazee","date":"2017-04-09T16:36:21.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That looks right.  I never would've noticed the new summoner icon.  That clears it up for me.  Thank you very much!","replies":[]}]}]}
