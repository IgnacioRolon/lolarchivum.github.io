If you cast it while a knockback or knockup spell is traveling towards Olaf, the spell still goes through while you are in Ragnarok form.\r\n\r\nThe best and most annoying example can be found if Vi uses her Ultimate, Assault and Battery on Olaf. If she casts it, then Olaf reacts and casts his Ultimate as she is travelling towards him, he can still be affected by the knockup, and even worse, be knocked up and stunned for LONGER due to the state applying twice in this form.\r\n\r\nThe other affected knockback spells I have seen this happen on are Maokai's Arcane Smash (Q), Alistar's Headbutt (W) and Syndra's E+Q combo.\r\n\r\nRioter Admiral BullFrog told me to repost it here to garner more support.\r\n\r\nPlease fix Olaf. :( - I can't provide video due to my upload being terrible but I can assure if you cast it as the spell comes in you get stuck.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Afic","date":"2014-12-09T22:33:03.593+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey, thanks for taking the time to post this.\n\nI just tried reproducing this issue a few times and wasn't able to.

What business does Olaf even have casting is ult while knocked up? Either he ult'd in time and is unaffected by the knock-up, or he got knocked-up and can't ult because he's CC'd.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rek","date":"2014-12-13T10:45:41.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Afic,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=whOn7u5Z,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2014-12-09T22:33:03.593+0000)\n> Hey, thanks for taking the time to post this.\n> \n> I just tried reproducing this issue a few times and wasn't able to.

This just happened in a game I was playing.) you can get knocked back still. The main difference I notice is this. When you get knocked back, you are normally turned to face away from the target, but Olaf with Ragnarok on will still be facing the target as if he had ignored it, yet his model is still displaced. \n\nAs for Vi's ult, the problem here is that if you Ragnarok on impact or prior to impact, you get 1 of 2 things happening.\n1) You either do not get knocked up and just get stunned in place for 5 seconds.\n2) You ignore the CC but take the damage, effectively CCing Vi as she is still stuck mid animation while you're beating on her.\n\nSo if either are intended, it has be consistent. Please help make Olaf's ult CONSISTENT!\n\n\nIn regards to \"lag\". On the OCE server I am in the same state as the server, netting in a ping of 15ms. Meaning that if it was to work as I would've hoped, I would actually be able to Ult through most of these instances, but that's not the case, unless you're saying that the person that IS lagging gets the priority cast. I know there is a very short casting animation for Ragnarok that might be the cause of this, but I just wish it could be fixed. I can't make a video of it because I can't get any replays (Rito pls?). LoLreplay doesn't work for me since 4.10, and I don't have the internet to upload anything.\n\n\nPlease help? :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"HeadCrusher","date":"2014-12-10T03:15:48.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this is somewhat related:\nWhen Quinn vaults at someone, she interrupts them before hitting them.
