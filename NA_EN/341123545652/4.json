I will instead follow the same nomenclature pattern as mages assassins and tanks and I will call them exactly _**what they are**_  ... right clickers. \r\n\r\n&quot;Hey Bob, what class do you main?&quot; \r\n&quot;Oh I main right clickers, how about you?&quot; \r\n^ \r\nWould be an example conversation with the new nomenclature. \r\n\r\nIronically I feel right when Riot decided to make it their selling point to rename the class to &quot;marksmen&quot; is also exactly when league started declining (I believe it happened at some point in season 6?). Screw that bullshit propaganda misleading name. Right clickers is the role that goes bot lane in the current meta.","replies":[{"poster":"ChompyWulf","date":"2018-04-15T22:06:46.876+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well they never miss a normal attack, so...that's a marksman.","replies":[{"poster":"341123545652","date":"2018-04-15T22:12:16.896+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ChompyWulf,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Q1s0EEeA,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-04-15T22:06:46.876+0000)\n>\n> Well they never miss a normal attack, so...that&#x27;s a marksman.\n\nOk, that was actually funny as fuck LOL","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JustaNewb","date":"2018-04-15T22:08:08.094+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ahhh... look up what Marksman means.\n\nmarks·man\nˈmärksmən/\nnoun\nnoun: marksman; plural noun: marksmen\na person skilled in shooting, especially with a pistol or rifle.\n\"a police marksman\"\nsynonyms:\nsniper, sharpshooter, good shot; More\n\n----------------\n\nAs far as a description of the CHAMPION's role?
