Thus backline carries benefit immensely currently, marksmen and mages that is.\n\nThe new and improved tanks and updated support itemization has served to bring their power up a whole set of lvls which is pretty much the collective nightmare of any melee carries. \n\nUnending CC and slows are abundant as are barriers and heals. \n\n\nBut why are marksmen so much more noticeable? It's because of 2 reasons, 1 small and big i think, and i´´ll name them in order.\n\nThe first is that AP itemization lacks good ways to handle the new tanks, massive health bars and powerful defensive steroids coupled with support barriers is making it hard to deal much damage to those moving walls.   This is a problem that AD itemization does not have. \n\n\nThe second and bigger reason is that the combo of {{item:3087}} {{item:3094}} {{item:3031}} is definately OP, it allows for burst on a DPS class which helps them shutdown things they shouldn't shutdown.\n\nThus in a meta were it's already hard to get to the marksman in the first place they posses a power they shouldn't, this is naturally causing frustrations to buildup.\n\n\nNot that anyone who noticed the static buffs a while back was surprised, we all realized it was going to be bad and the Cait history and current ongoings have proven that to be very true.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sasogwa","date":"2017-09-18T12:54:40.657+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"EVERYONE EXCEPT ADC IN 2k17 LUL","replies":[{"poster":"RainXBlade","date":"2017-09-19T00:06:25.724+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This guy's doing it right.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Verxint","date":"2017-09-18T18:08:24.990+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"*Vi ults the ADC*\n*Dies to ADC before her ult even connects*\nDivers in 2017 kek\n\nam I doing it right?","replies":[]},{"poster":"FilDaFunk","date":"2017-09-18T09:30:22.136+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd much rather get ADCs nerfed than everyone else buffed.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2017-09-18T14:46:43.045+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Class wide nerfs is kinda uncalled for when there is really only 1 that's outa control and 4 item abusers.\n\nNerf the one going overboard by himself and then the items being abused and it´ll calm down again.\n\n\nI dare you to call {{champion:22}}  OP, i double dare you :(","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2017-09-18T16:27:40.106+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's OP.\n\n*Puts on brass knuckles*","replies":[{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2017-09-18T16:36:55.902+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Flips table out of sheer anger* \n\n*Calls the closest pub*\n\n\n*Reserves a table and beer, dresses up fancily and puts on a monocle, ready discuss like a gentleman, and to win like a Sir.*\n\n*After putting the table back in place*.\n\n\nManners maketh man.","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2017-09-18T16:44:24.322+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Kicks table*\n\nI have a problem with authority.\n\n*Pats table apologetically*\n\nSorry you got involved, table.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2017-09-18T18:16:30.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":".................A warden telling a passing Sir with no real power that he has problems with authority.....do you perhaps need consultation?
