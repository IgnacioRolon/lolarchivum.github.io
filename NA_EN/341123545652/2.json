The one thing that counters adcs being armor you have to go 4 items deep to get any significant effect versus adcs and when penetration items is added (both from the adc and the Black cleaver carrying fighter) in you have to go another item deep to make it feel like you dont have half an item worth of armor and defense.

Occasional off character like Yasuo.\nSupport: Tank/Enchanter/Mage\nADC: Marksman.\n\nDo you know the issue with marksman though? There is Lethality/Crit/Other. It also has a defined meta, and rotating group of champions that are strong. That is no different.\n\nBut thats not the argument is it? Well why isnt there mages/bruisers/assassins/etc filling the carry role? A few reasons.\n\n1. Because of Marksman in general. I know people want champions to go into the marksman role... but Riot doesnt want a solid 6th of their roster unplayable. So they would have to be balanced elsewhere. Marksman are SPECIFICALLY balanced under the fact they usually have a support, have weaker laning phase (with the exception of having range.) They would have to balance marksman everywhere else to get other people bot, which would be a nightmate.\n\n2. Riot, Because that is what has worked so well so far. Is it kinda stale? yes. but there is a reason that they settled there in the first place and Riot balanced it around that.\n\n3. The double standard. Sure if you call Marksman just Marksman they are the only class with their own role. But lack of diversity is a problem in... EVERY SINGLE LANE. Not everyone can go everywhere thats why i call it a double standard. Assassins arent meta top lane, Mages arent meta top lane, bruisers arent meta anywhere other than top lane, supports arent meta outside support.
