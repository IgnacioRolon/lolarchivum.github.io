The heals and shields weren't a problem until Riot added items that give enchanters tank stats while also making their heals and shields better than if they built straight up AP unless they built straight up AP(even ignoring support item) and also managed to afford a Rabadons and even then there's no telling if it's a better shield or not.\n\nHeal and shield power is the problem. First off, they increase healing and shielding while also giving bruiser stats to enchanters, making them harder to kill. Second, they also amplify their own actives/passives, so each one makes the other items you build stronger. Make supports build items for their actives, instead of having them build everything that just makes itself better by building the next item.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sho ayane","date":"2018-04-27T03:49:39.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Many champions depend on their own inate shields in order to survive.

There is a better way to word your post instead of being a jackass about it.\n\nI do not believe that I came off as a jackass, I believe I am resurfacing (once again) a serious problem with an aggressive tone in the post. Just because you believe I came off as a jackass, does not mean everybody is going to see it that way. If you do feel offended that I was a \"jackass\" to you then I am sorry about that.

But I did not claim they arent working on a solution, please show me where I said that. I simply stated its 3 months and there has not been a solution provided to us. That is true, a fact, its 3 months in and a solution hasn't been provided. They certainly could have a solution behind the curtains, ready for us BUT it _**hasnt been provided yet**_. But this argument is certainly a much better and more clear/ fair arguement than the cesspool you posted earlier about me \"witch hunting\" or \"painting riot liars\".\n\nEDIT: And I should add that, the proposed problem itself (that riotrep. admits to) has existed in the game for over a year. So while I do not have any proof that they arent working on a solution, even if I were to make an educated assumption that they arent, would not be such a crazy guess as you suggest.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Scary Door","date":"2018-04-25T05:36:49.947+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":8,"body":"Yes, let's nerf shields, sure.

I don't know, sounds like the Janna made a great play and saved the adcs life as the support is supposed to do.  I mean, it's supposed to be risky to go in 1v2, is it not?  \n\nNaturally, I can already tell you what you would say if Riot dramatically changed things and Zed did go in for the 1v2, here would be your post, \"Playing support sucks, not impactful at all, the 8/0 Zed comes in and I, as the support, use everything I have to stop him but he just swag walks in, kills my adc and kills me with no counterplay\".  <-- that, by the way, is one of the most common complaints I used to see in season 4 during the height of assassin meta.  So don't even pretend like such posts wouldn't happen.  \n\nI think if you go in 1v2, it should be risky, you clearly see it differently.  \n\nA few years have really changed the community.  Remember when most people would respond by saying \"why are you going in 1v2?\" nowdays it's \"I should be able to solo everyone if I'm ahead\".","replies":[{"poster":"T4underbolt","date":"2018-04-26T07:14:30.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"ROFL. Please don't spread heresy calling Janna rolling face on a keyboard a play. Comparing to what zed has to do to kill someone nowadays, Janna is a champion that sleeps entire game. Playing Janna and making \"plays\" does not require any skills. Null. The shields need counterplay if they want them to be point and click shield nukes.\n\nAnd I wouldn't complain if the situation was reverted. Actually i AM fine as long as assassin has to do something more than e.g. right click q for oneshot just like rengar does. On one hand he is the only one with khazix to be able to somehow burst through shields but the way he does it has little to no counterplay especially when your team doesn't have shields. So it is bad for him to burst people with no counterplay but it is needed currently with how shields are overloaded. But other assassins that are more skill based like zed, talon have no way to reliably and fast kill someone before shields get stacked or burst through all the shields.","replies":[{"poster":"Snowman Arc","date":"2018-04-26T14:23:16.677+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plat 5 with 46% winrate, and having never played Janna.\nYou should at least know how the champion works and play with it to have an opinion.
