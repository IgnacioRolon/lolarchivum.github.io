I log into league, get a game started, get out of champ select and into a game without a hitch. When I get in the game, it goes maybe 3m without any problem. After that roughly every 5 minutes I am disconnected from the game, and the \"Attempting to Reconnect\" square pops up. I get back in the game after 30 seconds of waiting, and continue on. 5 minutes later it happens again. It may just be me, but it generally seems to happen at more or less critical points, such as when enemy does dragon/baron, or is pushing a tower I can easily save. I've messaged support about it, they game me a list of fixes, none worked. Anyone else with this problem/with a solution? Help would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-03-07T03:44:53.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Been getting this constantly myself...at wits end dealing with this issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blaze2100","date":"2015-03-07T00:48:01.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ive been having this issue for a week. every game, except 2 right after i reinstalled the game. pretty sure im getting reported in these games.","replies":[]}]}
