I'd change dragons so that they gave a \"mini baron buff\" to the players that participated in securing the objective.\r\nI'd remove the 5 different types.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is hard to get your team to help you secure one sometimes, much less get them to put their lanes in a position that you can solo one.\r\nI've even dealt with jungles (or laners) that WILL NOT dragon because they don't care about it because it isn't Infernal/Mountain... \r\n\r\nA lot of times nobody will help because \"It's just a mana/wind dragon\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis would also remove the random type mechanic which I feel can throw a match in turmoil especially when teams start stacking the right one (I.E. Zed has three infernals, Brand has three mana dragons)..\r\n\r\nWhen a team has three of the same, it can do a lot for the right champs... it makes it harder for the other team to fight them at that point.\r\nEspecially if that team is already oppressive to fight.\r\n\r\nA mini baron buff removes that RNG factor and encourages participation in the fight. It is a benefit that everyone can immediately see and makes securing it more important.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Rift Scuttles**\r\n\r\n\r\nThe amount of gold and exp tied up in these things are atrocious. If you steal a single camp early game, get both scuttles and both your buffs... The other jungle is going to be playing catch up for a hot second if they can't get a gank in. I've been on both sides of this.\r\n\r\nThe high amount of gold also encourages your \"team-mates\" to come steal them, which makes it hard to stay on par or catch up if if you fall off.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vision they provide makes it a nightmare to dragon/baron or gank nearby lanes if the other team kills it, especially if the other jungle is power clearing or the other team is more active in helping them.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd remove them from the game ultimately, but I'd also support lowering the spawn frequency drastically, and/or lowering the amount gold/exp they provide.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Rift Herald**\r\n\r\nNothing like losing an entire lane to this thing because the other team gets it and no one wants to help prevent it from shoving down your lane.\r\n\r\nI'd either remove this completely or change the reward for defeating it.\r\n\r\nI think some kind of buff and a mass amount of gold/exp would be more appropriate.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is enough going on the in the game, that a successful rift herald shouldn't  practically end the match.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Wall Jumpers**\r\n\r\nKayn, Talon, Akali, etc etc\r\n\r\n\r\nThis shit is ridiculous sometimes. Most of the champs that can do it, quite often have no problem completely wiping you out in a straight fight anyway.. so it makes it SUPER FRUSTRATING when they can easily kill you anyway, but the moment you get them close to dying, they just escape through a wall.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying I'd remove this completely. I think some champs can use it really well and it provides some interesting gameplay.\r\n\r\nTalon at least can't jump the same wall twice for a period of time... Kayn however can free-run across the map.. \r\n\r\nKayn jungle can be oppressive because he just shortcuts across the map and clears the entire board before you walk to your second/third camp.\r\nI can't count the number of times I've cleared three camps just to find Kayn clear my other half of the jungle. By the time you discover it, he has cleared the rest of his.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I'd do with these champs is lower the overall frequency of wall hoping so that it has to be a strategic choice and not a \"get out of jail free card\"\r\n\r\nI have no problem with Graves or similar champs being able to use his E to jump through a wall, but being able to cover vast distances provides too much mobility.\r\n\r\n\r\n**FIRST BLOOD and early kills/Snowballing**\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst blood should be rewarding.. but league is one of those games where a single kill can cause the killer to snowball out of control. I'd change the game mechanics overall to award a small buff for getting first blood. \r\n\r\nIn addition a team getting a few kills early shouldn't determine the majority of a game. I'd lower the worth of early kills.\r\n\r\nThis would encourage players to participate in early fights and minimize the impact of a failed/successful invade.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlayers tend to FREAK THE FUCK OUT when someone on the team dies. Lowering the value of kills early would provide a safety net for error.\r\n\r\nAlso.. players sometimes put too much effort into trying to get kills, rather than trying to secure objectives.\r\n\r\nI'd handle this potentially in several different ways.\r\n\r\n1. First 10 kills overall are practically worthless with a slowly ramp up in value. \r\n\r\nGoing with this, it would provide a fair amount across the board to prevent any one player from being targeted.\r\n\r\n2. A players first 3 deaths award little gold and afterwards full value.\r\n\r\nThis would give each player equal chance of lowering their impact to the enemy.. but at risk of being a major target (Lets all gank Mid because he's died 3 times)\r\n\r\n3. Kills are worth a little more than siege minions, but offer higher experience points. \r\n\r\nThe reward here is a little bit of gold and an increase in levels. This would lower the impact of a player getting \"FED AF\" because they wouldn't be stacking items while everyone is still finishing the first. Giving a lot of experience would give them a level advantage, rather than an Item advantage, which would allow the losing player to play smarter...\r\n\r\n4. Kills are worth more early, but become worth less later.\r\n\r\nI'm of the opinion that at 10 kills, you've probably got enough, and should probably be trying to get the rest of the team fed at this point.\r\n\r\nPlayers become ABSOLUTELY obsessed with kills over objectives sometimes.\r\n\r\nI've lost a lot of games because a midlaner is spending more time roaming than protecting their tower. It is incredibly frustrating to watch a player leave lane to chase a kill and lose a tower each time they do.\r\n\r\nKills would be almost triple their current value on the first three, and worth about the same as an assist at 10 kills..each kill after that would reduce their value until they were worth the same as a siege minion.\r\n\r\n\r\nCase 4 would be one of the more optimal paths because it would encourage focusing on objectives instead of a KDA. After 10 kills, you are going to start looking to end the match, and more profitable solutions.. (CS, Objectives, ETC)\r\n\r\nSome champs with the right items can just nuke you under your tower if they get a good 3-4 kills on you in the current system..\r\n\r\n\r\n**Remakes, Surrenders, Match Integrity**\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst.. The Remake window is too short. It should also never be put to a vote. If a player is AFK and the system detects it.. The match needs to end.\r\n\r\nAlso the AFK player needs to be ANNOUNCED right away to both teams.\r\n\r\n\"PLAYER NAME is AFK, match will end in 5 minutes if they do not return\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition.. the remake period needs to extend to at least 10 minutes, and include situations where a player was present, but AFK'd after purchasing items.\r\n\r\n\r\nFF@15 needs to go. I'm tired of the other team getting First Blood and someone on my team deciding the match is over.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFK matches need to end with loss prevented. If a player AFKs they have 5 minutes to return or it ends. No more 4v5's\r\n\r\nTo prevent the \"Getting a friend to afk\" abuse riot is scared of.. this would be a simple fix:\r\n\r\nEvery player has a visible \"LEAVER LEVEL\" to alert them of how high their AFK levels are. \r\n\r\nBlind matches, Draft, etc would have a lower impact on their score. RANKED matches would have an EXTREMELY HIGH impact and about 3 AFKs in ranked would result in maxing the level out.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the leaver level is high.. RANKED would be unavailable for say 10 games and consistently high or excessive levels would result in stricter punishments. This would be balanced around allowing room for circumstances beyond a players control and malicious AFKing.\r\n\r\nThe 3x in ranked would stand, because even RIOT has said that if you are having issues with your connection, you shouldn't be playing ranked.\r\n\r\nIf an AFK is worth 10 points.. it should take 20 games without an AFK to clear that off. (2 points per game.) 33 points for an AFK in ranked (33 x 3 =100). Points should also decay per day to help in situations where say a players connection was faulty one week and they had a higher score than they would normally.. this allows them to take a few days off play to ensure their connection is ok and give room to test it.\r\n\r\nThe week of a patch would also have a smaller impact on Leaver Levels to accommodate the issues that arise.\r\n\r\n**Weekly Rotating Bans**\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of champs in this game.\r\n\r\nTo the point I feel like you could give each play 5 bans.. and still face a hardcounter in your lane. \r\n\r\nNot only are there a lot of champions.. but you consistently see the same champions every day.. day in.. day out.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to see about 20 champions per week be Auto-Banned.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis would give a total of 30 potential bans per match.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition.. players would have to be able to play more champions and have a more diverse champion pool.\r\n\r\nI've felt the requirements to entry into ranked are too low.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Ranked Requirements**\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd make the following changes (based on current system)\r\n\r\n40 champions owned.\r\n\r\nLevel 99\r\n\r\nMastery 5 + champions only (40 champs at Mastery 5)\r\n(This is because ranked shouldn't be the place you are first timing a pick)\r\n\r\nThese changes would give a little balance.. level 30 doesn't take long to reach anymore and is barely enough time to master a few mechanics, much less the ones you need to be successful.. this would also make your account more valuable.. and probably discourage people from the \"I'll just make a new account mentality\" \r\n\r\n\r\n**Starting Items**\r\n\r\nI'd add a few options in there to diversify against a wider range of opponents.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see MR and Attack Speed starting items. As well as HP/Mana Regen\r\n\r\n\r\n**Mana Potions/Clarity**\r\n\r\nThese would come back... mana champs really suffer when they get matched up against non-mana champs.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Jungle**\r\n\r\nNothing sucks more than having a player swipe up a camp that you are trying to fight.\r\n\r\nI'd change jungle so that if the jungler is within a certain distance, they receive the gold/exp for the camp.\r\n\r\nThis would especially be handy for leashes.. because I'm always super nervous some troll is going to steal my camp.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I'm taking 10g less for CSing their lanes.. they shouldn't be farming mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI thought I had more.. but I'll stop here for now.","replies":[{"poster":"Senamz13","date":"2019-07-26T00:32:33.598+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"All I can say is good thing you’re not in charge of the LoL design team lol","replies":[{"poster":"Sylias Ravenmore","date":"2019-07-26T06:22:13.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean.. this is just my opinion.. feel free to present a constructive version of your own.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-07-26T00:30:29.778+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a lot of ideas here I feel would be actively detrimental or fail to do the full analysis I would expect of a game designer.\n\nDragon, for example, is an objective that is supposed to provide some early value but scale into a late-game advantage the more you are able to secure it. The stacking bonus provides an ability to close out games, which the extra value the *first* dragon gives means it functions as a comeback mechanic as well.\n\nConverting this into a miniature Baron buff effectively removes the late-game scaling from Dragon, and makes it merely a tool for pushing early -- something Herald already accomplishes. By removing Herald and changing Dragon you effectively just move Herald's effect but allow it to impact *multiple* lanes instead of one.\n\n>Nothing like losing an entire lane to this thing because the other team gets it and no one wants to help prevent it from shoving down your lane.\n\nYou neglect to mention here the incredible bonus damage you get from being behind Herald. A single person can reduce it's damage to just two plates (the original impact damage) by finding that opening. A successful Herald doesn't end the match -- it just sometimes gets you 1/2 to 1 tower, and more only if the enemy team is really inattentive.\n\n>so it makes it SUPER FRUSTRATING when they can easily kill you anyway, but the moment you get them close to dying, they just escape through a wall.\n\nMobility is baked into those champions power budgets, and mobility is limited by both resource cost and spell cooldowns. Changing that has a *huge* impact on every aspect of the game's ecosystem, and addressing the magnitude of those changes in a few sentences is...a bit ridiculous.\n\nI don't have the time right now to dig into the rest, but there's a lot here that seems to fundamentally alter many elements of the game for what I think are inadequately presented reasons. This reads less like the carefully considered proposal of a game designer and more like a list of things you dislike.","replies":[{"poster":"Sylias Ravenmore","date":"2019-07-26T06:21:28.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of my proposed changes are along the lines of leagues early seasons. I feel like its been a downhill shove since season 4... Season 3 was probably the best season in my opinion. These are based on what I've experienced both winning and losing around in the games I've played/spectated.\n\nAs far as my thoughts on dragon..\n\nI'd at least cut back the types of dragons down to three... maybe mountain/infernal/cloud.\n\nWith the \"mini baron buff\" I proposed.. I'm thinking more a benefit in being able to port faster, have some better regen, and a temporary boost to damage.. it wouldn't last nearly as long. I don't think it should give the minions any more effectiveness. Just kind of like a combination of red/blue buff with something special to it.\n\n\nTrading an entire games length worth of buffs for temporary ones that are more immediately effective.

I'm more concerned with eliminating the amount of stretching it feels like a Jungler experiences. As well as attempting to balance out for when your jungle doesn't attempt any objective control.\n\nI'm partial to jungle but I play all the roles (adc the least) and it feels like that is the one role with the most work in a match. I've got to be able to balance farming, ganking, counter jg, objective control, vision control and lane sitting for 4 players.. focusing any one of those areas leaves a deficiency in the other... especially if your team just isn't co-operating.\n\n\nGetting rid of Herald would just give a little breathing room.\n\nI loved herald when it first hit the scene.. but I've come to the point that it frustrates me. Here is something that I can't afford to lose, I've got to constantly keep tabs on and if the other team gets it... I've now got to be ready to drop everything I'm doing and potentially run across the other end of the map to handle... If I'm dead or say bot in a fight when it drops top.. then it can potentially wreck havok.

Season 3 was probably the best season in my opinion.\n\nA *lot* has changed since then, both in terms of the options that exists, the skills of the playerbase, and the philosophy of the game's design. Season 2 and 3 were the heyday of the bruiser and assassin metas, where abilities tended to just land and targets tended to blow up quickly. There wasn't anywhere near as much skill expression in individual kits, and the large similarities in functionality between them.\n\nWhile some people miss that, *League* has intentionally moved in a direction that offers more skill expression in their designs, which often means that -- used well -- those characters can do a lot. I'd honestly argue we're probably at one of the *healthiest* states of *League* as far as comeback potential, viability of a large number of champions, and evolving metagames. Is it perfect? Not at all. But I think it's a big improvement over Season 3.\n\n> Trading an entire games length worth of buffs for temporary ones that are more immediately effective. A strong offensive team can use that to their advantage and a strong defensive team can eliminate the buffed players and bring the match back into balance.\n\nThis skews heavily towards early-game teams though, as later-game teams won't have the power needed to handle a buffed opponent (and are more likely to lose Dragon). With Dragon as a scaling mechanism an early-game team can secure an early advantage but a late-game team that gets one still gets power when it's important to them. By swapping that for a shorter-duration one-time buff you simply let early game teams snowball their advantage more, while late-game teams find that an early Dragon isn't actually useful by comparison.\n\n> This would give incentive for you to ward your lanes better and communicate missing more effectively.\n> For the life of me I can not understand how 5 players go missing and an entire team fails to realize that they are either at dragon or baron.\n\nThere's already *huge* incentives for this. Vision and communication almost *directly* win games. Now, vision and communication aren't properly appreciated at all levels of play, but that's a feature of the game, not a bug. As players improve, they will get better and learn these things. Removing valuable gameplay elements because some players don't appreciate them would be like removing the Knight from Chess just because it confuses beginners.\n\n> The RNG of the dragons is really the main culprit.. Losing 3 infernals compared to 3 clouds has an entirely different impact on a game depending on the other teams comp.\n\n\n> It can be hard to stay on par with your opponent when killing you is already an advantage.. sometimes games reach a point to where a single champion can just delete your whole team because they got a few kills.. and now this dragon is making them even harder to kill.\n\nBut by that point you've already lost a number of fronts. *League* does intentionally have some snowball mechanics -- and some anti-snowball mechanics -- so that games that are basically decided can end faster. If you let, say, a Jax get 5 kills and let his team get a few Dragons, that's not a flaw of the game -- that's your team not managing to control a hard-scaling carry.\n\n> As far as herald goes.. I'm more concerned with eliminating the amount of stretching it feels like a Jungler experiences. As well as attempting to balance out for when your jungle doesn't attempt any objective control.\n\nThe game shouldn't balance for junglers who don't play for objectives, much like it shouldn't balance for carries who don't know how to last hit. Those are skills that need to be acquired to play the game, and compensating for failure to do those things ends up teaching people that you don't HAVE to play the game. That's the opposite of what you want in a competitive, skill-and-macro-decision-based game, because it tells players that objectives don't matter.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vlada Cut","date":"2019-07-26T15:15:29.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sylias Ravenmore,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6HbK89an,comment-id=00030001,timestamp=2019-07-26T06:21:28.002+0000)\n>\n> Most of my proposed changes are along the lines of leagues early seasons. \n\nOld League can't function with modern mechanics nor it will ever return that way.\nPeriod.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sylias Ravenmore","date":"2019-07-26T05:17:55.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of my proposed changes are along the lines of leagues early seasons.

You said you're a game designer, and you said you've worked in the industry for 15 years (writing for 20 years), but now you're distancing yourself from the notion that you're a professional game designer? Is this similar to someone claiming to be a stockbroker who's worked in the stockbroking industry for 15 years, but what they really mean is that they got a gift of one share of Disney stock for their fifth birthday and now they're 20 years old?\n\nAs far as I can tell from what you said earlier, you've never worked on a single completed project, and implied that you rarely do anything that could even go on your resume. Never mind being paid by a game development studio for game design work, never mind being paid by a game development studio for work unrelated to game design... are you employed in any capacity? Are you in school? Some other situation, perhaps (no need to specify)?\n\nWhat does the phrase \"I am a game designer\" mean to you? What does \"worked in the industry\" mean to you?

I worked entirely on Lighting and as a 2D lead.\n\nI took a break from digital games for a few years and hooked up with a few startups doing tabletop. The first one was a wargame/rpg and it was a 4 man team. We started promoting it heavily and contacted a few publishers to accept us. Wizards returned our call and offered to buy it out completely. We were excited. We wouldn't be on the design team anymore.. but the money was good and we'd be able to say \"we made that\". So we took the offer. The game never shipped, and when contacted, they told our lead that they determined \"It wasn't a profitable venture at this time after further analysis\"\n\nSame story two years later, except we had less material..

I think there is enough there though to show that the scale of the work is massive.. which would lead to understanding on why it's taken so long.\n\nSo what you're saying is that your claim of \"I (a game designer)\" was a red herring as you have literally never done actual game design work and every scrap of your experience in the industry is not only as an artist rather than a game designer, but for projects (big _or_ small) that don't ship and you can't even point to, so you are just as much a game designer as anyone else on these boards. I mean, I call myself a programmer even though I'm not writing the new Windows Terminal at MS or whatever, but there's actual evidence that I have programmed (website, GitHub, live coding streams, threads here on Boards, etc.). And now that I think of it, I did some programming while I had a tech writing internship (made some scripts to generate quarterly reports, speed up the version control check-in process, that sort of thing), and I occasionally tutor in programming. So that's some verifiable programming as well as some professional programming work.\n\nMaybe you _feel_ like a game designer, self-identifying as one? That's cool. Reminds me of Rincewind from the Discworld series, who was most definitely a wizard, although he didn't finish wizarding school and never actually casts any spells. But he's got the pointy hat, and has wizard buddies, and all that. Good for you! :)\n\nBut it might have been unwise to... um... _publicize_ these feelings using wording that doesn't come across as... uh... _authentic_ to people who aren't familiar with your idiosyncrasies.

Most of my best work unfortunately has been for indie companies that didn't make it or a larger company bought the game out, at which point my job was gone.\n\nI worked on two board games that ended up sold off to Wizards, and then effectively killed off. They tend to do this often with competing products. One I did creative writing for (Story etc) the other I worked on the rules for interactions of magic and power costs.\n\nI enjoy applying mathematics and etc to game mechanics. \n\nI tend to use the Fibonacci sequence a lot in my work, and also multiples of 9.\n\n\nCurrently I'm doing 3D modeling/2d Texturing for the above mentioned game. I might have some screens I can share later, just got to make sure its cool and not showing nothing \"proprietary\" or that could be used to identify the work/studio.\n\nThis will be my first project that ships to XBOX and will actually be something worth dropping on the resume.\n\nI can however, share screens of my personal 3D work if you are interested in that. Although.. most of it just me doing what I call \"skillpushing\" where I attempt to improve some aspect of my work.\n\n\nOutside of my contract work.. I've been focusing on my personal game design project and have about 20 years into the creative writing aspect of it. I'm not really comfortable showing off what I've got because I'm constantly doing revisions and I have entire sections that need massive rewrites just because of the scale of the work. I've been focused on rewriting the first age lore and smoothing out later connections. It covers 19440 years, and as such, is jumbled. I'm considering scaling down the time frame again (it was a lot longer) and pushing key events closer together. It was previously being developed in the Unreal Engine, but I've spent the last year or so learning UNITY and feel like it will be a better home for what I'm going for.\n\nThe Unreal Engine is great if you want a very \"Artistic Game\" with high end graphics... but I'm shooting for low poly because some of the games features will result in lots of data being on the screen at the same time and the world space is fully destructible.\n\nLast test run I did on it, I was able to get three players connected and about 300 units a piece on the battle field with only a small drop in frames. That was back when I was still in UNREAL.. I've moved to unity and unity provides networking solutions for what I need but I've not made as much progress as I like in actually learning... I've mostly been focused on my current contract.. a bit of creative writing.. and improving my 3d skills.\n\nI'm trying to reach a point where I can wear less hats for that project and focus on the creative spectrum (I just want to model and compose music- aside from writing) I desperately need a programmer that can handle piecing together the systems I'm writing.\n\nIt feels like finding a programmer is the same as finding a drummer around here.. they are either already attached to a project or not interested in your project. Which is why development is moving slow.. I'm basically having to learn new skill sets just to get things working. I'm also a strong believer in not going with the first design. Reiterations always achieve better results.\n\nI'm in no rush though, I'd rather die working on it and have it perfect, than release it and have something hodgepodge.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2019-07-26T06:00:28.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sylias Ravenmore,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6HbK89an,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-07-26T05:21:52.728+0000)\n>\n> Plenty of my own projects.. but I've worked in the industry for 15 years.

And I know you think rank has nothing to do with them, but none of what you said really applies to anything above _maybe_ silver.\nIn higher elos or just among anyone with decent game knowledge:\n- no player will tell you dragons don't matter unless they're infernal or mountain\n- everyone knows the importance of scuttle crabs and could tell you that removing them would be a huge mistake\n- rift herald will never come close to ending a match (1-2 turrets _at most_ if dropped at a perfect time with no one to contest)\n- people know that champions with mobility have that in mind when it comes to their balance (a certain amount of their strength budget is taken up by their mobility, leaving them with weaknesses in other areas)\n\n\nAnd I can't even fathom what you were thinking with the changing the value of kills early vs late, x amount of kills \"being enough\", your afk policy, rotating bans?? (sorry, the champs you main are banned this week, the comp you wanted to go is impossible, maybe come back next week), your rank requirements, or your very odd jungle changes. \nAll of those things are either just ??? ideas, or things that would only maybe benefit the absolute bottom of the barrel players and would negatively affect everyone else.\n\nalso\n>Rank has nothing to do with these thoughts.\n\nthen you later say\n>This is all based off my experiences in league. Yours may vary... but for me... these are the areas that negatively impact my games\n\nwhich is it? \nAnd you're saying you want to push the focus on objectives over kills (which again is more common in lower elos, as anyone who's climbed will tell you objectives win games), but at the same time want to remove or completely rework main objectives to make them less important?

Mastery sticks with a champion regardless of any changes to that champion, including reworks. This means that someone who mained a champion prior to being reworked like Aatrox, Mordekaiser, Urgot, Yorick, Malzahar, Taric, Kayle, etc. will still be able to play the new version without any time invested.\n\n2. From the other end, the Mastery system is only half as old as the game itself, meaning that it's entirely possible for players who have had years of experiencing playing come back to the game and have 0 mastery for any champions. Not to mention mastery also limits the use of newly released champions.\n\nMy suggestion, if a skill/knowledge metric is to be used, is to aggregate grades for recent matches with that champion on relevant maps/modes.","replies":[{"poster":"Sylias Ravenmore","date":"2019-07-26T05:34:45.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well the reason I was proposing a mastery requirement is generally a long the lines of preventing players from first timing a champion in ranked.\n\nYou are correct, it doesn't reflect the skills.. but it does reflect experience with that champion.\n\n\nAt mastery 1 you might be able to play a champion well... but by mastery 5 you should have a strong understanding of that champs inner workings. You would definitely have played enough champs to know... OK they took this champion and they wreck havok on my Yi Jungle (example) i.e. who is going to hard counter you and who you're going to wreck.\n\n\nRanked isn't really the place to be first timing a champ in my opinion. \n\n\nAs far as Reworks go... anyone that plays a champ to mastery 5 can generally adapt to the changes presented.\n\nI mained WW, Raka, Nunu, Taric, Poppy, and Mordekaiser (and a few others) all before their reworks and when they changed.. it wasn't too hard to adapt. For the most part the \"essence\" of the champ stays the same... you just might be doing line shots instead of point and click.\n\nI feel like if you put yourself into character, you do more successful with that champion. I try to think how the champion would behave and play to that \"method\".. when I play WW I tend to try and think like a wolf hunting in the forest.\n\n\n\nAs far as new champs go.. I think they should be on the rotating ban list for at least the first month after release.\n\n\nCountless times has a champ released and wrecked havok with several patches of dialing back before finding its niche.\n\n\nLeague is about adapting.. but my main objection comes from players taking those champs into ranked having NEVER played them..\n\nI've worked too hard to get where I am for \"you\" to experiment with something untested in ranked.\n\nNew champs being autobanned for at least a month gives RIOT time to get them balanced live, without some overbearing factor appearing.","replies":[{"poster":"TakaDama","date":"2019-07-26T11:10:56.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You really just want to be right, don't you? I even agreed that untested champions shouldn't be taken into ranked, and offered a solution (aggregation of match grade data from normals for said champion). Maybe more leeway can be given for having higher mastery and in fact nothing should a player with m6 or m7 from playing as those two require multiple S's to get, but basing allowance into ranked on Mastery, which is based on experience and not necessarily skill, is not a good solution.\n\nOk; let's take Old Sion vs New Sion then. Old Sion could be built tanky AD thanks to attack damage provide with E and massive lifesteal from Ult and could be built AP thanks to 100% AP ratio on a 2 second point and click stun and and an aoe shield. New sion now has a pseudo-revive passive, has an AoE channeled knock up, an armor shredding slow skillshot, and an ult that makes it clear he is a tank. Only his shield is similar.\n\nOr Old Taric vs New Taric: Old Taric also had a point-and-click stun with damage and duration varying based on distance, a point-and-click heal that worked better on himself, an aoe attack that passive granted armor to all allies, and an ult that gave him and him alone a massive offensive steroid.\n\nOr Old Urgot vs New Urgot: outside of the Q and maybe a case for his old ult and shield now being his E, nothing is the same here. He even builds much differently now.\n\nEven champions that only have parts of their kit reworked can play and even build differently: Singed losing health from mana mean that rushing RoA and Tear wasn't as good, Skarner getting the spire passive pretty much restricted him to jungle, Gangplank getting barrels and the flaming sword made him a bit more nuanced.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TakaDama","date":"2019-07-26T01:57:11.506+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll reply here as I just now read the solutions proposed and the implications they have on gameplay.\n\nWhile I agree with the issues presented, the solutions provided are not well thought out.","replies":[{"poster":"Sylias Ravenmore","date":"2019-07-26T05:48:46.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been thinking about this for about 2-3 years now..

Yours may vary... but for me... these are the areas that negatively impact my games and at one point I was playing 18 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\nMost of what I bring up is centered around pushing the focus on objective control rather than KDA and bringing snowballing under control... I'm partial to jungle ( i play everything but ADC..working on that) but Jungle has felt rather caustic since the introduction of the RIFT SCUTTLES.\n\nIt gets to the point, I don't enjoy playing jg because it is the one role where a single mistake can have huge ramifications later.\n\nI feel like I HAVE TO SECURE SCUTTLE to stay relevant and the other 4 players are constantly begging/demanding ganks.. even when I'm on the polar opposite side of the map with no reasonable way of making it to lane in time to assist. \n\nI can't gank top because scuttle just came up and I can't let the jg get that extra map control, gold/exp, and eye on dragon... same with top and the rift/baron.
