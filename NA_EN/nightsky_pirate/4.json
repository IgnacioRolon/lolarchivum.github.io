WAIT! Before you thumbs down, I'm being serious here. I get plenty of honors and appreciations for playful banter, enemies and allies on the Rift alike. My beef is with the mediocrity of banter that has become standard. Sure, it's better than the flaming troll hatching ground that it was, but this is ... well, depressing. **People are AFRAID of talking in all chat until they don't care if they get punished.**\n\nI've seen more players say \"?\" than \"hf\".\n\nNobody likes the word oppression, but that's clearly what's happening here. Are we... no, you, Player Behavior _witch-hunters_, really so averse to some aggression in chat that it's come down to this? This is a PVP game. League's mechanics inherently promote the negative behavior you're simply silencing. You want to smother the flames, do it with kindness. How? Here are some examples of how people can be promoted to be better to each other, even if not an answer for League.\n\n-Repeated play with same players on both sides. Forcing people into a sense of community will create recognition and promote mutual respect.\n-Significant rewards for being assisted. Basically like Pyke's cut.\n-Major recognition for being a real team player. You're making examples of bad behavior, now make examples of good behavior. I'm talking top 1% across all leagues, so that everyone can see them. Something big, like the ability to arbitrarily reward LP once per-player-per-GoodExamplePlayer as much as they want, or limited-use negate loss of LP if they feel the team deserves it.\n\nNow, never-mind how. Obviously this needs traction before anything like that can happen. First I want you to collectively start opening your eyes to this silencing of rage being a problem. The source of the problem being the excessive and overpowered shaking of your finger and demanding justice so much.\n\n{{champion:122}} demands it! Royal blood, that is.\n\n*edit* I'm a blunt person. Sorry. Last time I said something like this, someone eventually responded seriously and my behavior, I think, has improved because of it. I'm sure I'm not a special snowflake here with these thoughts. Forgive _witch hunters_, I'm calling out only a group of people, not everyone here, perhaps not even the majority. You should know who you are.","replies":[]}
