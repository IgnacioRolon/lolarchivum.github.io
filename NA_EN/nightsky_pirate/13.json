Shaming is 100% not the intent.\n\nSomething interesting happened in this match. Basically, player A, who was \"streaming for anti toxicity purposes\", ironically turned toxic on another player as we moved into midgame. Player B was told that we needed him to do something. He accepted this decree, and ... lets say, enthusiastically tried to carry it out. It killed him and ended very poorly, leading to Player A's rage at Player B. Looked like the rage and flames would burst into tears and full tilt. Yet through encouragement, his rage was quelled with a tactful suggestion for him to take leadership of the team.\n\nWith a sprinkle of positivity - \"We still have 2 or 3 more attempts\" - he hushes. Yet another lost team fight has Player A in a fuss again at Player B, where full on Lux-mode positivity activates. \"Let's try to give him the best chance we can\" - \"It's okay, we still have one more good shot\" - then the kicker - \"(Player A), what should we do now?\" - \"Okay (Player A), you're the leader\" - \"Let's do it!\"\n\nPlayer B was weakly defending himself, trying to justify his action. I said - \"Its okay, (Player B), you're our hero.\" - \"We really need you\" - \"(Player B) can do it\". I'd attribute my ability to influence them and the team to follow through with A's leadership due to the friendly banter at first and during the lane phase and that I had Darius at a disadvantage in lane. Player C didn't say anything at all but complied, while Player D hesitantly followed through with A's lead.\n\nSome of us are already well aware that positivity works (sometimes). While we ultimately lost the game, it ended far better than it could have. Player A humbly accepted his defeat, Player B didn't have to deal with A's directed rage, while C+D seemed to coordinate a little better with the leadership.\n\nAnd I, well, the enemy called me an Big Minion Garen at the end. To which I responded, \"Yep, I'm the Biggest Minion.\" If only they knew.\n\nEdit: Again not really calling for a discussion, but comments welcome as usual.","replies":[]}
