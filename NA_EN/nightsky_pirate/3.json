Examples for clarification would be welcome. The why doesn't matter here, just the facts. The intent is not to open a discussion to opinions on what is good or bad, just the facts. Morality, good strategy and etiquette are irrelevant in this thread. It's not meant as an exhaustive list of all things behavior, but if anyone wants to add to the list, feel free, so long as its with the intent to be sure that your facts are correct, and not to make a player's version of the code of conduct.\"\n\nIn the last couple months, I've had a few potential revelations pertaining to the behavior system's rules based on discussions on this forum. [First Fact Checking list here, linking only for the curious.](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/LAH6Tnzy-fact-checking)\n\n1. A single ZT phrase is all that's needed to be punished for ZT phrases. (How enforceable it is, is not the question; it is the rule that matters in this thread.)\n2. You must always play to win. (2 and 3 are not exclusive, but only one is absolutely correct.)\n*2a.  I define playing to win as pursuing objectives AND resources to destroy the enemy nexus. \n3. You must never play to lose.\n*3a. I define playing to lose as not contributing to the destruction of the enemy nexus, offensively (faster than they get yours) OR defensively (by obstructing them from getting yours).\n4. Farming lane(s) and towers while avoiding everything else is not inting, as long as the lane(s) get pushed to threaten towers/inhibs/nexus.\n5.

(Very important to distinguish that this is NOT etiquette, but the RULE on behavior.)\n6. You can defend yourself and/or others in chat.\n7. You may not retaliate in game. \n8. You may discredit allies. \n*Example: Leona repeatedly makes bad engages, blaming you as Ezreal for not being aggressive enough. You cannot say Leona doesn't understand that she's losing by making stupid engages, but can say you won't engage if she initiates without the JG. Leona continues to make bad engages into mid game, still blaming you for not having enough damage. Again you may not say that was her fault for feeding the enemy Draven, but you may encourage the team to disregard Leona's initiations, declaring that you will have better chances as a 4v5 than if she keeps initiating teamfights.\n\n*edit: bonus example: The Leona may defend herself by saying she did make a bad engage, but would like to see Ezreal focus Draven because their Lux can't hit the broad side of a barn, so they can turn it around. Subsequently she can say she thought the team would win the fight by taking down Draven (let's say they did but it was Draven dead to all 5 dead on Leona's team) and she'll be more reactionary and will avoid initiating.","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2020-02-28T04:55:32.912+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can condense half of these into \"Don't use chat to derail the game.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-02-28T05:21:10.230+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you would be affirming #5-8, then.

Discuss and argue can be seen as the same thing. I think the issue is more arguing about things that are not aspects of the game itself. You can argue strategy, as in one person has a plan, someone else has another plan, and you argue briefly over what to do. But arguing over whos toxic, whos feeding, in other words; things that are not aspects of the game itself, are punishable.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-02-29T02:26:58.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im glad you said so!\nThe difference between arguing and discussing is straightforward: arguing is trying to convince another to accept something, while discussing is simply stating something.\n\n In discussing strategy, one party states a strategy, and another May state another strategy. If one is \"everyone push mid\", the other may say \"teamfights aren't going well, I'll split push.\"\n\nArguing would continue that: \"but we can win under tower, you're not a good split push champion.\" It could be right, but at that point the 1st party is trying to convince the other that they are correct.\n\nFurther discussing it would be: \"it will be desperate without you.
