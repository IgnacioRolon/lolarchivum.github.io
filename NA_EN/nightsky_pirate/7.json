I know how it works. As the title states, I'm ashamed because I used the system to get someone punished. Someone who, by the rules, was in violation, but in the human regard, was not out of line. While I was the inverse- out of line in the human regard, but was playing by the rules.\n\nI don't report people often anymore, because I don't believe in the system. This person was frustrated at me. They believed I was not contributing to the team, which clearly was wrong, though one notable error was made at about 11 minutes when Udyr was caught in red side jungle by river and midlane- my team is blue. TF decided to jump in to help him, I decided to let him go in favor of the tower. For what it's worth, I quickly pinged my intent when Udyr engaged. Had I chosen to go in and help, it might have won us the dragon a few minutes later and changed the game, as I could have saved TF and killed Gallio. I was called out for this error, and at first I thought I made the right choice, lightly defending myself instead of accepting the criticism. For this, Udyr went into the deep end of tilt and the offending player raged at me.\n\nIn the end, Udyr repeatedly made much larger errors and cost the game, and while he was tilted, it wasn't him I reported. Everyone else kept trying, and if anyone ought to have been punished, it was Udyr, because his *actions* were not in the spirit of the game- by not contesting Baron and instead farming blue wolves and backing while the rest of us got in positions, running from teamfights while lingering near them, repeatedly getting caught in bush facechecks, and I'd say questionable Frozen Heart item choice. I can't find his history, so I don't know if this is a habit item. Udyr is not the focus, however- the point is that he was the offender to the spirit of League but is totally scott free because all he said was \"I'm tilted because of Garen now\".\n\nThrough the rest of the game the offending player would, at any opportunity he conceivably could, repeat that I'm the sort of player who wouldn't help the team. Rather than apologizing or admitting my error, I continue to lightly defend myself- \"I am helping\", \"You're being selfish\", \"You lost a 4v4, that's not my fault\", *\"I did nothing wrong\"*. The last was in context of him saying he'll report me. Yep, we all know it here, talking about getting people banned is, ironically, an offense. In as SJW-approved terminology I can muster, I inform him that I haven't broken any rules, but he has. I don't even say what specifically he did, because I couldn't think of a Bot-approved way to say \"saying you'll get me punished is reportable\" at the time. I knew I made a mistake by that time, but at that point was carrying and defending myself from further undeserved accusations.\n\nSo I'm upset, but not at him, not at Udyr, but at ... well, this forum. At Ulanopo and a few others. Normally, I would have admitted my mistake. I should have apologized to Udyr and promised better. In undeserved fury, I report the offending player for it. Just because he broke the rules. I was the one in the wrong with regard to chat, and while he should have dropped it according to the rules, according to human decency he should have insisted that I realize my error.\n\nWhich I did. I just didn't admit it. He deserves another apology now. I was wrong to report him. {{champion:32}} \n\nThe point of this thread is that rules do not align with decency and good morality, and it is up to you to make the right choice.

The ones banning someone's hovered champion in the champ select because they can earn the benefit of doubt for it or randomly stealing roles in draft picks. Ones typing 'gg ez' after winning a match. Provoking someone into cussing or asking for reports, to call them out as a troll for _obvious_ trolling. Just to report them after the match and get them punished. Running off to people's lanes and smiting their cannon minions, repeatedly. Letting people die after pinging that you're going in. Then spamming them with ?'s. Running around as AP Draven support because you're trying new stuff. Telling people to pick a champ for you and then never trading back etc. They are all playing by the rules which Riot set. \n\n> [{quoted}](name=Nightsky Pirate,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=cQtV5Kkb,comment-id=0002000000000000,timestamp=2020-01-03T02:40:32.156+0000)\n> \n> The rudimentary translation of the rules demand respectful, non-negative communication.

The reason for Korea's competitiveness and improvement lies in the fact that players criticize and help each other improve. If someone plays poorly, I let them sit there making obvious mistakes which I could have corrected. But because of the rules, I wouldn't. Even if I wanted to help them, I wouldn't do it because even if this person is grateful to me for it, another team member could use the rules to get me punished for pointing out their mistakes. Besides, chances are that they won't be able to capitalize on what's taught in that match itself. I don't want them tilted either. So I'll let them continue making those mistakes until they learn about it themselves. Its selfish but the best approach to keeping yourself safe within Riot's ruling system.\n\nNo Negativity. You force people to swallow their anger, do not allow criticism after someone makes a major mistake. Or bad-mouths them! Trolls them. No retaliation allowed! You cannot defend yourself after this happened the 5th time in a row where someone is trying to flame you. Its not going to help in the long run. Not surprising if these same people begin trolling or abusing loopholes within the system to vent their frustration after finding out that the people who abused them went unpunished. Like spamming multiple ?'s - how does that help? If the person made a mistake, instead of telling them their mistake. They get a bucket load of ?'s. Isn't the point of 'No Negativity' moot anyhow? You may as well have let the person spamming it tell them what they did wrong, lol\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Tele II,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=cQtV5Kkb,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2020-01-03T02:12:45.285+0000)\n>\n\n> I will say though, its nice to see someone else finally point out that the rules are not a moral code that applies to real life.

It isn't an issue of the rules not aligning with decency or good morality, just that your moral code presents terms that conflict with the rules of the game.\n\nAnd insofar as your personal moral code doesn't in and of itself break the rules of the game, that's fine. You can conduct yourself according to your own views within reason, but that doesn't mean that the rules of League are in contrast to decency or immoral.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-01-02T18:32:17.594+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ah!
