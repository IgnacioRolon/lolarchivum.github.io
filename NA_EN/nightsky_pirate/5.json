These are surely the minimum level of taunting we are allowed to say. I seek the boundary of what is acceptable.\n\n\"Lowly blasphemer!

My genius will supplant you.\"\n\n\nTaunting in all-chat is an effective strategy. It can help you win games. Taunting is a blatant attempt to trigger the opponent to make impudent choices or fear you more than they should. It is a core function in the game that only a handful use, and fewer use effectively. \n\nYet what taunts are legitimate? What are the boundaries? Clearly going past them can be even more effective for winning. It is not my intent to find what taunts are most effective, but rather, what taunting is legitimate and effective. _I think these are good examples._\n\n\"You do know Sion's passive, don't you? I mean, I'd assume in ranked, a player would know the champion they're playing, but you make me wonder.\"\n\"For a Vel'Koz, you're not very good at zoning... Actually, you seem a shame to Vel'Koz players... You should try Yasuo, he's more your style. Brash.\" \n\"I'm embarrassed to be matched against you. I thought I was better than this... This is ranked, isn't it?\"\n\"I've seen Support Nunu do a better job in JG than your JG... Sorry (insert lane opponent), better JG wins!\"\n\nWhat about name-calling?\n\"Are you guys a couple? Because I'm seeing an ADC with anemic girlfriend support.\"\n\"You had to wiki his passive? What a pleeb.\"\n\"SCRUB- you thought you could flash into a 1v1 against a fed Morde?\"\n\nWell, I'm not sure where the boundaries are. I intend to take use taunts, responsibly, aggressively, and legitimately.

(Playing Cho'Gath) Season yourself before you come back, please! The flavor is getting predictable. Maybe a little spice this time?\n3. (Lux misses an ultimate) Ooh. Nice ult.

They're disrespectful, insulting, and overall toxic verbal attacks.\n\nHere's an example of legitimate taunting within the bounds of the rules from one of my recent matches;\n\nI was playing Jinx, attempting to recall at low health, and the enemy Jungler started chasing me. I managed to get down into the safety of my turrets and my Support helped me kill the Jungler, and I typed in /all chat \"No. >:c\"\n\nWhen I finished my recall, I fired my ult down middle lane because I saw our Jungler was about to kill the enemy ADC, and my ult landed and scored the killing blow, so I added into /all chat; \"And a boom-de-yada for good measure.\"\n\n_That_ is the kind of taunting that's allowed. It's curt, a little bit rude, but it's not straight-up insulting anyone's intelligence or skill - it's celebrating my own.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-08-05T08:41:52.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"\"No\" with an angry-sad face isn't taunting. \"Bo-Ya\" is not a taunt.

The \"No\" very clearly was meant to wound the enemy Jungler after their failed attempt to kill me on backing. The \"Boom-de-yada\" was an added boast for extra salt in the wound. I was telling them, plain and simple; \"You failed, now watch me style on your teammates\".\n\n> Ctrl-2 is a taunt. Darius has some good ones. \"Dat Fail.\" when seeing Ashe.\n\nWell, then just fall back on CTRL+2. If you like hearing Champion Taunt quotes, do that.\n\n> Get Real.\n\nIf the only form of taunting you see as legitimate is toxicity and insults, then I'll tell you flat-out; _Don't bother taunting unless you want to get sacked with a penalty._ 'Cause like I said, all of the examples in your OP are against the rules.\n\n> What is a REAL taunt that is within the bounds?\n\nI just gave you an example. Non-insulting jibes that err more on celebrating your own skill than bashing and belittling the other players.

Like repeatedly catching and killing the enemy jungle at their camps, or roaming to the same lane over and over. \n\nTyping long lines like what you suggested might not only tilt the enemy but your own team.\nHaving a player on your team repeatedly stop to type a novel flaming the enemy team in all chat is pretty annoying.\nSome food for thought.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-08-05T11:44:40.132+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thanks, that's the sort of insightful comments I've been seeking.

It would be shocking if she got banned for that. Angering, even.\n\nOf course I'm not looking to find the line by testing the waters. Those last examples (such as the sexist one) I haven't used in game, I know not to go _that_ far. Yet surely the banning team wouldn't ban the very banter the in game champions use, that's inane. Some of the one-liners have enough kick to them to satisfy me, but not limited to one champion, especially the nice ones (haha).\n\nI hope someone can actually nail down what is and isn't good, as the ToS aren't clear as they seem to suggest their champions' banter are against the code of conduct.","replies":[{"poster":"TheUrbanKitsune","date":"2019-08-05T11:57:35.617+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright I'll give it to the Jinx in your example, if that was planned out with her team, that's pretty hilarious and I doubt anyone would report her for that.\nIf she actually had the intention of running it down, and her team just made the best of a bad situation, she would be getting a report from me for sure. \n\n\nAnd yeah, testing the waters with Riot is a dangerous game.\nIf you really aren't sure, general rule of thumb-- ***If it's racist, sexist, homophobic, or a personal attack, it's a big no-no***.\n\nSo basically instead of, \"Ha! have you ever even played Nidalee before? I can't believe you missed that spear, you should play something else, noob.\"\nSay something like, \"Nice Q.\" or \"You should probably aim AT me\" (though the latter may be a bit risky, still)\n\nSimple yet effective.
