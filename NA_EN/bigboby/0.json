I like to play League of Legends instead of other MOBA games because sound and voiceover in LoL is just great. But here is my complain:\n**1)**  {{champion:99}} casts Light Binding and misses an enemy champ but hits minion. She says &quot;Gotcha!&quot; :D I think there is no reason to say &quot;Gotcha!&quot; if she misses an enemy champion.\n**2)** On the lane with no friends around Lux casts Prismatic Barrier. She says &quot;I&#039;ll protect you!&quot; :D She is talking to herself? Is it by design?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Zimberfly","date":"2017-06-29T17:25:12.444+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi BigBoby!\n\nThanks for your note! As a member of the audio discipline here at Riot, I'm hyped to hear that you like our sound and VO!\n\nThis is super good feedback. The way that we trigger our voice lines is always being iterated upon. As it is now on Lux, the line triggers on cast, and the game doesn't differentiate between whether allies are around or not. However, this is really good feedback that I'll pass along.","replies":[]}]}
