This is just plain ridiculousness.  My favorite champion is Rammus and I 1-tricked him this season.  Rammus is 28/44 in terms of pick rate.  He is below average by every metric.  It took me 100 games of ranked solo queue (0 games played with a duo) to reach Platinum.  Your most played champions are Ezreal (3/18), Lucian (4/18), Evelyn (14/44).  Between the two of us, you're the one playing the \"most played, most dominating champs.\"  But in this season you've played over 1,400 and you're still in Gold 4.  That's 14 times more games!\n\n> That's an extremely flawed comparison.

Maybe, MAYBE, once in a while you run into a Diamond player on a smurf in a Gold 4 game.  Diamond 4 and up make up less than 4% of the player population.  Silver and Gold, which is where you're playing, makes up 63% of the player population.  If every single Diamond 4 and up player hopped onto their Gold 4 smurf and queued up at the exact same time that you queued up, there would still only be a TINY, SUPER TINY chance you'd end up with one of them in your game.\n\nThe reality is that those \"Lebron Jameses\" aren't actually that much better than you are.  Take this dude for example:\n\nhttps://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=sfahsalkhflka\n\nA day ago, he played against you, on Xayah while you were on Kaisa, and he dunked you, hard.  17 kills, almost double your CS.  Must have been brutal.  I bet you walked away from the game thinking, fucking matchmaking, Lebron James on the other team, wtf.  The game after, he was 2/7/4 on Lucian.  And after that, he was 2/10/4 on Xayah.  People have good games, and they have bad games.  Some people are more consistent, and put up the same level game after game, and others, like this Xayah, are more feast or famine, and take big risks that either are rewarded heavily like in your game, or punished heavily like in the next two games.  The key is that _on average_ these players are able to win about as frequently as you are playing with and against the same people you're playing against.\n\n> Your true rank is where you don't feel bad whether you win or lose.

How you feel about your losses doesn't matter.  Some people are more upbeat, some people are more practical, and some people want to blame their losses on everything under the sun.  At the end of the day, all that matters is your ability to win.  And if you ability to win is sitting at about 50%, like say, across 1400 hundred games, you are accurately ranked.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Its All Skillzz","date":"2019-10-27T17:16:42.755+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1 vs 5 or lose. literally every game i had in plat 2 untill i got demoted to gold 2 was pretty much i had to 1 vs 5 or we lost, bot lane goes 0-15 by 10 mins, top lost inhib by 15 mins, jungle is still 0-0-0 at 20 mins with no dragons taken, if i go adc an go bot mid is somehow 0-8 by 11 minutes.  it feels like once someone dies everyone just permatilts and stops playing and further pushes the enemy into snowballing, like the adc will be off splitting bottom while they are pushing down mid. this shit is very common in high gold/mid plat and its actually digusting how much worst your team always is than the enemy team, autofill doesnt help either.","replies":[{"poster":"Etherwolf","date":"2019-10-30T13:55:46.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's worse in low gold lol I just can't really understand what to do.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Keiaga","date":"2019-10-26T22:36:59.702+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"If you're losing consistently then you aren't as good and knowledgeable as you think you are.","replies":[{"poster":"Etherwolf","date":"2019-10-27T12:25:09.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which is illogical because I'm only 20% of the team and 10% of the game.
