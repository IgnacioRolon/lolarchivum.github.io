For hextech chests specifically, you'll have to earn at least an S- grade for the match or be in a premade with someone who received the same or better and have not earned a chest on that champion this season. For key fragments, each drop reduces the chances of the next drop, as this droprate is more of a curve than a line. The only way to modify this droprate is to play with friends in a premade, as this *slightly increases* your drop chance.\n\nI strongly recommend giving our [**Hextech Crafting Guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide) a thorough reading if you haven't already.

If you haven't gotten any punishments recently and aren't getting key fragments it is likely because you are at the cap (12 fragments)  This cycle resets monthly for individual accounts based on when they first got a key fragment drop.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OokamiNoke","date":"2016-12-29T00:03:43.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i wish someone from riot could actually respond but we all know thats not gonna happen lol {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
