In the game, I would lose control over my character for about a minute. I would have auto- attack off, but I would lose control, not be able to cast any spells, not move, and my Champion would auto- attack. I would also be able to watch it happen without any frame drops or lag, so this is not a lag issue. This bug would cause me to experience bullying of a kind (I would be called noob for running into a lane and dying), and defeats. This happens every few minutes, or whenever I try to attack or cast a spell. Also, sometimes I would also not be able to open the shop. I am really upset with this, and I think this may be an input bug. Or maybe it's because I play on a Mac? If you know a fix or answer for this, please tell me.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-08T17:28:35.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could think of a few reasons that could cause your controls to become unresponsive.
