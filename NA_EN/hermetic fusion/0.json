Adc runs his face into draven and sona and dies for free. He then proceeds to spam my choice of keystone as if that&#039;s the reason he died. Dude continues feeding and apparently that&#039;s my fault too. I leave lane thinking this is probably a lost cause, help get a kill mid, help get a kill top, bot continues feeding. Game actually ended up really close but jesus it&#039;s sad to see this shit going on. Report me the dude says, apparently it&#039;s my fault for not winning his lane for him. Next thing you know ppl gonna blame their support for every cs that they miss too lmao.","replies":[{"poster":"R107 Games","date":"2019-01-09T20:29:46.716+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want to see true toxicity go to the EUW/EUNE/OCE/Korea regions.\n\nNA toxicity is childs play","replies":[{"poster":"GreenKnight","date":"2019-01-09T20:31:22.804+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=R107 Games,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=rnc7T8WL,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-01-09T20:29:46.716+0000)\n>\n> If you want to see true toxicity go to the EUW/EUNE/OCE/Korea regions.\n> \n> NA toxicity is childs play\n\nReally?

You REALLY don't. Besides, chat is moderated there too. Just recently a few of my friends got perma'd. They were toxic, so they got what they deserved, but it just shows how tight the system is.","replies":[{"poster":"Hermetic Fusion","date":"2019-01-09T21:02:30.386+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Did they deserve to be banned?","replies":[{"poster":"GreenKnight","date":"2019-01-09T21:31:00.067+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hermetic Fusion,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=rnc7T8WL,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-01-09T21:02:30.386+0000)\n>\n> Did they deserve to be banned?\n\nOh yeah.

I don't think you ever went to a park and shouted \"go fuck yourself everyone\". \n\nA match is kinda like a public space. You meet people you don't know, in a place not owned by you. You seriously can't expect that insults should be tolerated in this location, right?","replies":[{"poster":"Hermetic Fusion","date":"2019-01-09T22:13:41.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"What do you do when you play a pick up game of basketball and one player decides to clown around with his feet?","replies":[{"poster":"GreenKnight","date":"2019-01-09T22:14:58.054+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hermetic Fusion,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=rnc7T8WL,comment-id=000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-01-09T22:13:41.109+0000)\n>\n> What do you do when you play a pick up game of basketball and one player decides to clown around with his feet?\n\nIs it a public game?

Everyone is wronged on some level, or at least in their own mind at worst case scenario, but the people getting punished are the ones getting report brigaded apparently like a bot does it and it can't make decisions based on human conduct, how could it. You don't get people choosing to behave better by punishing them for not behaving how you want them to, you get it by giving them an environment to make their own decisions on their own. Trying to tighten the noose around their throat is just gonna make most people resentful.
