Sure, but that still translates into a damage buff because she can use execute more often, so my point still stands.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Monkeyofoof","date":"2020-02-05T23:33:10.837+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"but that's the issue riot only cares about pro play they could give two shits about most of us which i find annoying i mean we spend money on akali skins and then what do we get a big fat nerf to her i mean riot doesn't give a shit about their players most the time which i find kinda sad that riot does this kind of stuff but i mean all we can really do is complain until they revert her back but lets be honest they wont because riot can tend to be a little stupid with balancing i mean the big thing i found this her was using her ult for gap close to secure a kill then ulting out to try and survive {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Scarlett Gray","date":"2020-02-05T22:30:36.661+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=iiGazeii,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fxIpATEQ,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2020-02-05T22:18:06.323+0000)\n>\n> They're desperate to tone down her pro play presence, so they're (finally) hitting the things that affect pro play the most. \n> \n> Now she can get buffs that actually benefit the 99% of us that don't play this game professionally.\n\nThat makes so much sense for them to. That's a real good plan, that is, if they even care two sh*ts to do so. Riot is more on appeasing the players rather than making understandable decisions. Maybe im wrong and I just dont see the grand scheme of things, but akali is dying, riot is turning a blind eye, and players are picking up pitch forks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Infernape","date":"2020-02-05T23:21:04.967+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"Thank CertainlyToxic for making a champion that was known to be cancerous in the past infinitely more cancerous than she was before.","replies":[{"poster":"IP Masquerena","date":"2020-02-06T00:29:43.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She wouldn't be a problem if Riot wouldn't follow the mentality of Jhonny from Plastic 12 needs to be able to play anything.\n\nAll the \"balance nightmares\" are that because of that mentality.
