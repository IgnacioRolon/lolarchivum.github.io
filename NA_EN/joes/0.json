It was the amumu game on Aug 9th and Velkoz game on the 11th.\r\n Thank you for your time riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-13T15:25:12.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"An account can get marked by [leaverbuster ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ)even if it was not intentional.  This is because leaves still cause other players a negative experience, and being down a player sucks.  The best way to get through this is by completing the required games without further interruptions.  It's important to resolve what is is causing you to disconnect, and if you need any help let me know with more details on what's happening.  I'll be around!","replies":[]}]}
