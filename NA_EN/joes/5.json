We typically look for players who are would be great candidates to test what we're looking to try out on the PBE at the time. For this reason, the criteria changes up quite a bit, but we consistently look for *really active* summoners who are a *positive influence* on others. Check out our [**PBE FAQ**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751904-Public-Beta-Environment-FAQ#top) for more details on this system.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"AsashinDaka","date":"2017-01-11T06:46:08.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what if ive applied like 6 different times within one years?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-11T22:59:43.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On a single account? o.O I don't think that would affect your chances.
