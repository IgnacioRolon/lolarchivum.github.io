This has never been happened before in several years of playing League of Legends, as the ping stayed consistently at &lt;100ms. However, for about 3 weeks or so recently, the ping keep spiking up to 120, 150, 200 and even 300ms sometimes. Although the game is still playable, this issue causes delay and makes the game unenjoyable.\r\n\r\nI have contacted the technical support of Riot, and tried several troubleshootings including flushing DNS, unplug/replug router, etc. I even tried to contact my ISP and had two expert technicians from ISP to fix the problem, but still no use. \r\n\r\nSo now, Riot's technical support passes this issue to my ISP, and the ISP passes it back to Riot's server. Although I appreciate the help of the technicians, I still want this issue fixed. \r\n\r\nI do not know what to do, and decide to ask the expert administrators/gamers on this forum. Any help would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-11T17:07:20.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If our tech team in a ticket specific suggest an issue with your ISP, then it may be that your provider is taking a scenic route to reach our servers.  I haven't looked into your ticket, but I imagine you ran a [traceroute ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq2)to get an overview of where your ISP is going.  If not, it's a great tool to check it out for yourself.  Unfortunately, there isn't much more I can offer here, other than continuing communication in your ticket or contacting your ISP.  Hopefully, this can get resolved asap and get you back in the game!","replies":[{"poster":"zDeathsama","date":"2016-08-11T22:30:52.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did the WinMTR thing, and reported the result to the Riot's technician. He told me that I have intermittent issue with package loss, yet when I told that to the ISP technicians, they said they cannot figure out what is wrong as everything regarding to their Internet connection seems fine.\n\nStrange enough, I have done some research recently and there is no one facing this issue but me.","replies":[]}]}]}
