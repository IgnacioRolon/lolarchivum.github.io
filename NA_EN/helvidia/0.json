I&#039;m sorry Riot if it turns out this is something i ought not be posting.\nI just wanted people to be able to use these amazing artworks as desktop backgrounds (because I looked around for some official wallpaper versions for a while, but to no avail). Seriously, I've become quite enthralled with the Bilgewater story/event and inspired by the artwork involved. Props go out to the artists and Riot for running a cool event (not to mention the details put into the Butcher&#039;s Bridge map: Glorious). \n\nAnyway, hopefully this works, I got the images off the page source, so they aren't simply screenshots. (I would suggest opening the links in new tab).\n\nWorld first, followed by characters:\n\n\nAnd again, I'm sorry if this violates any rules by Riot. Let me know and I will delete the post ASAP. I understand copyright enough to know that my \"distribution\" of this art might not be allowed. Even though I'm not selling it or claiming it as my own.
