After I offered all the informations requested about my account,now I am no longer able to access 3 of my emails(linked together), my League account or RiotSupport... \r\nNow I have opened another ticket and explained what happened to me, that I cannot access my emails and account, and RiotSupport responsed with: '' We have answered to this subject on your email address, please go to the other ticket to solve things efficiently''. \r\n**So I need to ask you guys: Is my league of legends email( and all the recovery emails attached to it) deactivated?** \r\nPlease help me to understand what is happening..","replies":[{"poster":"Timethief49","date":"2017-04-23T15:13:48.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot games has no control over your email account so it has to be a different problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Kled is Hokage","date":"2017-04-23T15:30:30.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I had this problem, I went to the League Website.. Even though someone changed my password, my account was still logged into the website. Then I checked the account informations. My email was no lorger the email of the account, it was an email displayed like this: \n****bled@riotgames.com \n\nI feel guilty that I forgot to take a screen shot. Anyway, if they have no right to control my email, then why it was changed? \n**If the proccess of an account deletion requires an email change, then I should have been asked!**\n**I would have said that my email was simply hacked and I would get over it... But the fact that I saw this email \n ****bled@riotgames.com makes me wonder what is happening.**","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-24T04:24:23.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not so sure Kled would make a great Hokage. I mean, does he even believe it?\n\nI went ahead and dug into this for you, and it looks like we did get your request put through to have your account deleted. To clear things up a bit, you had sent in several tickets at once so the support agent was referring you to another ticket where they had sent you answer, not creating a new e-mail for deletion purposes.\n\nI'm not actually seeing any record of that email you mentioned being on this account, so I'm not sure where that came from =\\ , rest easy though knowing that your account is in line for deletion. We'll have your face on that mountain any day now. Unless you don't want it deleted anymore! In which case just write back in and let us know by 06.05.2017!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Timethief49","date":"2017-04-23T15:46:10.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well other people can probably call their email riotgames idk how exactly emailadress names work ^^\nyou should answer to the ticket you already wrote and be patient.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
