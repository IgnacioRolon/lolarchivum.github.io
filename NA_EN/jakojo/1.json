I'm just a douche bag I guess.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"_**This is a rant, so be prepared to downvote me**_\r\n\r\nSo yesterday was my birthday, and for me my birthday is just another day, I try not to make a huge deal about it. That being said when my Editor and Chief and I walked in to our office it was decorated for her and I (we share birthdays). I thought it was cool that they did it, and took the time to do it for us. So, I get home and my mother prepared a meal in a Crock pot. For those of you that do not know, a crock pot is a slow cooker that you can braise meats in and do other things. She had put ribs in and various spices in it, she got it from a magazine. She was at work when I got home so I tried some. It wasn&#039;t that great. It had a lot of thyme (which is not my favorite spice) in it. So, I was like &quot;Eh, whatever I&#039;ll eat some to make her happy.&quot; She gets home and I&#039;m upstairs signing up for my spring semester. She has me try more meat and said &quot;What do you think Coby? I got it from Good Housekeeping.&quot; I said &quot;it&#039;s pretty good, is there thyme in there? I can taste it, it&#039;s pretty pungent&quot; She just goes &quot;Yeah&quot; and walks back downstairs. After I finished doing my stuff on the computer I come downstairs to get a plate of food. I notice a plate that she used to set the wooden spoon on is yellow. Yellow means only one thing in the kitchen: Turmeric. I fucking can&#039;t stand that spice and she knows it. My mother is the type of person that will see &quot;healthy diets&quot; on Facebook and try to get me to do them with her. Turmeric apparently, according to the PhD&#039;s on Facebook is very good for you. So I asked, &quot;Why is the plate yellow?&quot; I already knew the answer so I&#039;m not sure why I asked. &quot;It&#039;s turmeric, I put it all over the beef, doesn&#039;t matter anyways you can&#039;t taste it anyways, plus it&#039;s very good for you.&quot; I thought how dumb that statement was, but I didn&#039;t say anything. Then she tells me &quot;Well if you don&#039;t like it here, just have these noodles instead. Eat or don&#039;t eat.&quot; Now my mother is very passive aggressive (I think I get it from her) so the tone and the way she said it was a bit, dare I say it? Bitchy. So I looked at her quizzically and just said &quot;Whatever,&quot; (I know immature) and put my plate upstairs and went to my room.So I&#039;m asking was I in the wrong? Today she would not say a single word to me, she was even pissed because she had to drive me into school (we only have my car to drive and I let her use it to go to work). I got out of the car and said &quot;have a nice day mom, I love you.&quot; Her response was &quot;Whatever&quot; and she drove off. So GD, my friends and fellow scholars. Am I just an asshole? Was I the wrong person? This isn&#039;t the first time this has happened. I&#039;m not like Gordon Ramsay when I tell her I&#039;m not to fond of a recipe that isn&#039;t even hers. I figure since it&#039;s not her recipe it&#039;s fair game to tell her that I wasn&#039;t too fond of it. She does the same when I try other peoples recipes. Eh whatever. Good morning everyone, hope your morning didn&#039;t have this fucking level on tension.\r\n\r\nP.S. Sorry for any writing mistakes, I was rushed cause I have a class to get to :)","replies":[]}
