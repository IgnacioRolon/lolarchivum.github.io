I do not do my work at 100%. I&#039;m one of the students that &quot;if I set my mind to it I could be great!&quot; I&#039;ll just slide by on C+ and B&#039;s because I just show up to do your tests and occasionally do homework. Truth is I spend little time on myself and more time in front of a computer screen. I&#039;m a passive aggressive bastard who binges on his anti-anxiety medication, cause I&#039;ll be honest, you can get a pretty kick ass high from it. I look forward to taking your class. \r\n\r\n~Coby\r\n\r\nOh and I&#039;m the opinions editor of the Monroe Doctrine.\r\n\r\n(For all of you on GD, that&#039;s my schools newspaper).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFuck those questions.","replies":[]}
