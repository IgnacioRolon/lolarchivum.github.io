I used to play at medium settings 60fps (some drops in hectic teamfights, but rare and manageable) but now I have to play on very low settings, and still get occasional dips.\r\n\r\nI've tried reinstalling, editing nvidia settings, uninstalling unused background processes, turning off unnecessary background processes, and following [a recent post by Riot](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) but nothing seems to work.\r\n\r\nCould internet connection be the issue? I know it sounds dumb, but I recently moved to college and the internet here isn't the best. I have to play on wifi and jump from 30-70 ping with the occasional 200 here and there.\r\n\r\nAlso, I've noticed that when I try to uncap my framerate, it sticks to 60 (v-sync is off). I'm not sure if this has anything to do with my problem but I thought it was worth mentioning.\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated, as playing more mechanical challenging champions is hell at the moment.\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-04T23:10:39.666+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that you're having some fps issues and appreciate the troubleshooting you've done so far.  There is one other thing that you can try!  A recent update with Windows has been causing fps issues for some players, and the culprit is the auto-enabling of the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html).  Disable this to see if that help.  I don't think your connection could hinder your FPS, but it's really important to get that fixed as it could cause another issue entirely.  Reach out to your campus IT to see if they can help with your network strength.  Let me know if that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Smuckasaurus","date":"2016-10-07T04:16:44.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the help! Disabling it certainly helped my framerate, and uncapped it as well. Unfortunately it didn't fix the issue, as it was still dropping. Turn out the reason my fps was so bad was because my laptop was overheating, so I got an extra fan and propped it next to my gpu, all fixed now!","replies":[]}]}]}
