Why do riot think they are enough to incentivize reformation? What reasons do toxic players have to not just keep/re-offend? Especially with the wave of players being hit with ranked reward ineligibility. \n\nYou took everything they worked for other than self pride in their rank from them due to honour level cap on rewards. What reason would they have to reform or change their behaviour? Seems like a major flaw in the honour system being linked to ranked rewards. Why not give extra back to honourable players in terms of consistent rewards, through honour level rewards (Like the Key Fragments except good) and an extra skin for honourable players and insentize consistent good behaviour rather than a large punishment or reward based on nothing to do with the effort players have put into there years worth of league and ranked hardship/climbing.\n\nThis isn&#039;t me asking for ranked rewards because lord knows people on this board love talking down to players who they dont deem honourable i just wish the punishment and reward system linked to honour was more well thought-out and complete.","replies":[{"poster":"Brotha","date":"2018-11-13T16:47:06.207+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would be far less of an issue if first time offenders didn't have to spend literal months grinding back to honor 2 for rewards.","replies":[{"poster":"Globgor","date":"2018-11-13T19:38:38.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Completely agree.

I said, \"up to this point,\" because I don't think the person to whom you were replying was talking about the separated rewards for next season.  The majority of complaint discussions flooding the board this past week have been specifically about the current rewards people aren't getting.  His point had nothing to do with split vs. year, but rewards in general.  To paraphrase his response to you:\n\nIf players don't want to risk losing their accounts or becoming ineligible for rewards, they should control their behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"Globgor","date":"2018-11-13T19:42:37.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And my response was answering that with. Well like i said in my first post people who will still continue to play league and carry on playing to grind ranks arent going to care in the long run about these rewards and they also most likely wont care about the new seasonal rewards if they are broken into 3 split ones since they wont get any since one chat ban and you'll be locked at honor 0 for that season split.\n\nHe gave reasons players would care about reforming to my post and i answered it with a counter argument as to why these points are irrelevant. I think you are the only one confused about what any of the posts in this thread are discussing or mean. I completely understood his post and mine made sense in response.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ı Sona ı","date":"2018-11-13T06:07:57.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uh..
