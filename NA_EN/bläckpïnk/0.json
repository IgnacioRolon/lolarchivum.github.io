She says it definitely wasn't there a week or two ago. I can't seem to find anything about this emote besides from the VS. event a few months ago. She can't even find it in her purchase history nor did she get a notification from a gift. It wasn't in a box either. \r\n\r\nShe and I are wondering how she got that icon? Or how others could get it too. It's really pretty","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-07T20:59:30.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You probably unlocked the emote from the VS event you mentioned! Now that emotes are a system all of their own, they went back and gave everyone who had those temporary event emotes a permanent version of them ^_^!","replies":[]},{"poster":"CLG Mercenary","date":"2017-12-07T14:16:44.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its from the event a while back, a lot of people never received it after buying/completing the mission so its been redistributed (from talking to others).","replies":[]}]}
