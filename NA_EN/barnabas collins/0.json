My laptop automatically updated itself, I went into league, started an ARAM, and then my entire computer froze. Couldn't alt f4, couldn't ctrl alt delete, I could only hard kill it.\r\n\r\nI went undid the update to go back to my former version of Windows, but it still did the same thing.  Everything about my computer works perfectly fine (internet, videos, streaming, etc.) it is literally just when I am in the game. \r\n\r\nIf anyone has any idea what I could do to get back to playing, that would be amazing.  I have a Lenovo laptop that is in fine condition. Thanks a lot for your assistance guys. \r\n\r\nIf there is any info that I could give to help you out with an answer, feel free to ask.\r\n\r\nThanks again!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-27T20:43:16.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I recommend updating your Windows to the most recent version in any case, to make sure you have correct drivers, security, and products to run things smoothly.  The freezing itself may be due to the update automatically enabling the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html).  It's been causing a freezing issue for some players, so disabling that should do the trick.  Let me know if that helps!","replies":[]}]}
