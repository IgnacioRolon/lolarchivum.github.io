Let's reset those really quickly and you should be good to go. Keep in mind, this will reset any custom keybinds and settings you may currently have.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[{"poster":"Likes Guys","date":"2017-08-12T00:03:50.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If this were the issue shouldn't it impact every game? right now its impacting most of the games I play but not all.
