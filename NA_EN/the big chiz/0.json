My ping starts out at 30 but frequently spikes to 300 during the game. I have no problems with the client, just the actual game. I'm not sure what I can do to remedy this League exclusive lag.

No lag, then mid/late game my ping all of a sudden starts to hit 300. spikes down to 60 then back and forth to 300. Been happening periodically for a couple months. I can play any other game for hours, ones that require way more network usage and way more computer stress and no problems. it's just a league issue that they seem to be ignoring. \n\nShould be looked at. not made excuses for.

But we all know world is one big Hoax.. You guys are just too lazy to come up with a solution, cus you sit there and soak in the dough while we just keeeeeep waiting untill we are sick of the game cus nothing ever changed... Pretty fucking weird that all online games work except league right? Nah you guys are just lazy, I know you're a company and a company will do any thing do earn as much as possible with the least amount of work.. Yet, you will probably respond by saying \"Oh and it's all fine no problems here and there world is all flowers and sunshine\" Bitch that's a fucking lie. And I know we can't do anything about this, cus you guys will never listen, and you got all planned out. If the net wasn't a thing I'd probably beat up and choke all of you one by one.\n\nLuckily i only play league casually now since I don't wanna make time for it like how I used to few years ago. But when I play, I can expect tons of packet loss straight in my face..\n\nSo dev's whenever reading this, reconsider your honesty and work, after doing that, change whatever you can to please their \"customers\" cus that's what we are and you're not serving us.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ΠΑΡΘEΝΟS","date":"2017-08-22T17:45:48.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no they dont ... checked on random servers ..i play on eune  even if the servers had been on america i have 120 ms there .... probably you need to buy more servers when more people play your game rito situation ....","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"they feed","date":"2018-01-17T07:57:07.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fucking lag i cannot play it 300 ping still lagging and below i love lpalying league of legends since 2010 pls fix this RIOT PLS","replies":[]},{"poster":"NouUuTeKisKisLTU","date":"2018-01-11T19:28:06.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please help me me big lag lol game i play machmade ranked i no play seconds go and go and i no play i wait for lose game  this is crazy situacion  very bad   :)))))))","replies":[]},{"poster":"dragonman1234","date":"2017-12-31T13:05:08.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well, you have no solution for the high coz it is not the problem of your PC our internet.
