Is this what is supposed to happen, and is there any way to make it take up less space?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-09T22:57:27.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, the client should be around 7-8 GB.  If you have a really old install then you could have a lot of old assets and need a fresh install.  You should be able to get a fresh game and get any old assets removed through a clean uninstall via [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367).  This would remove the game entirely, so you'll have to reinstall it!  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
