Head back to the legacy version to get this fixed up:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Helorion","date":"2016-12-22T20:03:45.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or I could just play a quick ARAM and get some extra IP since the check equation is messed up. :P\nThanks anyways. :D","replies":[]}]}]}
