This is an everyday thing at this point. I had to refresh my entire operating system because the patcher became corrupted mid patch. I'll give riot the benefit of the doubt and say that it wasn't their fault even though that's the first time that has happened to me, but then after hours of fixing that mess, I finally log in to find that I can't even purchase the new champion I've been saving IP for. Even if she becomes available within 30 minutes of now, it's the constant inconsistency that has been plaguing this game for a while now that's making me seriously considering uninstalling. Server crashes mid 6.9 patch, dynamic queue is an all around cancerous experience, and now this garbage. Fix your game Riot, you're running it into the ground.","replies":[{"poster":"Jaredspecjr","date":"2016-05-18T14:41:04.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope she becomes available soon cause like in the next 30 mins or so I have to leave to drive my sis home who unfortunately lives a couple states away... and I have to bring her back so I'm stuck there till Sunday.
