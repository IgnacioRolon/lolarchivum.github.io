Or, if they want to really get creative, they could make him/her Noxian to have a truly &quot;good&quot; Noxian champion for a change.","replies":[{"poster":"Kynin","date":"2017-10-16T20:52:18.976+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about Jayce? {{champion:126}} \nI have always imagine him turning to the camera and saying \"Stay in school kids\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Ve1vet","date":"2017-10-16T20:40:52.238+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"Catch: he can only be a super hero for 3 hours at a time, then he just turns back into a normal guy ;)\n\n{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[{"poster":"SkyblazeHydraX3","date":"2017-10-17T00:22:27.032+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"**PLUS**\n\n**ULTRAAAAAAAA!!**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Radiant Seraph","date":"2017-10-16T21:34:37.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't get it :D","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Ve1vet","date":"2017-10-16T21:53:05.590+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's probably for the best tbh, it is an anime ref.","replies":[{"poster":"Radiant Seraph","date":"2017-10-17T21:15:39.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh wait, All Might.\n\nI am surely slow as hell.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Infernape","date":"2017-10-17T12:04:45.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plus.
