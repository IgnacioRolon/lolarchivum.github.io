His laning is weak and made up for with both experience and hard shoving. Ekko wants you under your tower so he can snowball off your bot.\n\n> - I feel like my playstyle is more effected because he picked Ekko then the champion I picked. \n\nThis makes no sense. You should always be altering your playstyle based on your opponent. If you go melee into Malzahar you have to play a passive lane. If you go teemo into pantheon you have to die. That's just the game. If you feel Ekko punishes you more for not adapting, it's because Ekko is one of your tilt champions.\n\n>  I feel that even if I do catch out Ekko or get a pick on him he will be able to escape so many situations he shouldn&#x27;t because of his ultimate.\n\nHe is a slippery assassin. If he is using his ultimate defensively that's a safer teamfight you should be forcing.  No risk of being bursted by the ult for being out of position, higher chance of killing him if you land your burst.\n \n> - Tons of crowd control on an assassin.\n\nHe has two forms of CC, a ranged slow and a situational stun he should never land on you. If you're having that hard of a time dodging the W maybe you should buy some boots.\n\n> - Maxing E gives him some very reliable damage.\n\nYou've never played Ekko in your life. Not well anyway.\n\n> - His Q and E combo isn&#x27;t actually all too fair.\n\n\"If I lose its not fair\" reminder Ekko has to use his waveclear ability, dash, and assloads of mana early to hit that combo.\n\n\nYour criticisms seem to have more to do with your \"feelings\" than with any actual numbers or facts.","replies":[{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2017-09-02T16:42:22.133+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"See you missed the point. Dodging Ekko W isn't necessarily difficult, even when he does it usually from stealth where you can't see it, and managing his passive stacks isn't too hard. However **he forces the enemy to keep track of too much**. Its ridiculous. \n\nBut I'll take away your bias arguments anyways. \n\n> You mean being zoned?\n\nWell Ekko does zone me. But I mean he has like 40 different things I need to keep track of if I want to live. See I'd rather be playing my character rather than \"against Ekko\". \n\n> Easiest to dodge skillshot in the game\n\nIts fucking massive and if he does it from stealth you won't see it coming. In fact the projectile speed is pretty good its just the delay that makes it difficult to land while they can see you. Yes I know you can ward up to prevent this, its just ANOTHER thing you have to manage when fighting Ekko. \n\n> Short range Q, second part gives you 3-4 seconds to move either slightly to the left or right... or just back up.\n\nIf you back up you will just get hit by the second pull back because he gets some very potent slows on his Q. Up to 60%. And again my point went totally over your head. Its not that its too difficult to dodge his Q both ways, its just yet ANOTHER thing I have to take care of when fighting him.\n\n> Only way this happens is if youre squishy and heavily out of position or lack reliable burst\n\nUnfortunately the vast majority of mid laners are squishy, a very large group of them lack reliable burst, and you would consider heavily out of position anywhere out of my 1/3 of the lane. \n\n> Ignite, Ekko also has to account for how much he will heal\n\nSee the fact your telling me to use ignite in order to mitigate his healing brings up ANOTHER thing you'll need to remember when fighting Ekko. \n\nEkko does not. He can tell he will get a big chunk but he doesn't need to do anything of the things his enemies do. If I'm fighting Ekko I need to account for how much he will heal so I know if I can kill him afterwards, if he will be able to reengage and kill me, if my ally can kill him alone still, etc. \n\n> Also critical for a good ekko, otherwise you will ult yourself into your own death\n\nOnce more you completely missed the point. I never said his dash is easy to use or broken. I said its _yet another thing to manage when fighting Ekko._ \n\n> Second most telegraphed ability in the game. If you ever stand on it, unless baiting with zhonyas, you deserve to die period.\n\nFor how easy an Ekko ult can be to land (not that it is easy but its no Shurima Shuffle) I do not think it should be a guaranteed kill. Its already a massive heal and dash with untargetability, why does he need free kills for when he lands on an enemy too? \n\nAnd again. I'm not here to talk about how fair you think Ekko is balance wise. He is extremely poor design wise. \n\n> He isn't braum. It's the same as Gnar or Vayne, except easier to avoid than either\n\nIf I have two stacks of his passive on me in lane I have to walk away from the wave so he doesn't pop the third one. Flat out something I have to manage and play around. \n\n> He's an exceptional ganker. His laning is weak and made up for with both experience and hard shoving. Ekko wants you under your tower so he can snowball off your bot.\n\nHis laning is not weak. He might be a mid game assassin or something, but he has a _very safe_ early game. Between your Q allowing mindless wave clear, your shields, your Q+E>sprint away combo, your dash, and your ult which gives incredible safety, Ekko's laning is not weak. \n\nI'm not saying that Ekko doesn't get stronger as he gets items, or that he doesn't have low kill pressure in lane. But his lane is very safe and relaxed. \n\n> This makes no sense. You should always be altering your playstyle based on your opponent. If you go melee into Malzahar you have to play a passive lane. If you go teemo into pantheon you have to die. That's just the game. If you feel Ekko punishes you more for not adapting, it's because Ekko is one of your tilt champions.\n\nFunny how you compare Ekko to Malzahar, Pantheon, and even teemo. All champions people currently hate or hated very much. \n\nYou are right, I should alternate my playstyle based on my champion. However when it gets to the point that my playstyle is more so effected because you picked Ekko then it is based off my character, its overboard. Ekko forces the enemy to play his game. \n\nAnd Pantheon being a \"your going to die\" lane is **Not ** okay. Tons of players hate this about him and its a big reasons he is in line for a rework some time in the future. \n\n> He is a slippery assassin. If he is using his ultimate defensively that's a safer teamfight you should be forcing. No risk of being bursted by the ult for being out of position, higher chance of killing him if you land your burst.\n\nYour sort of right. He does lose out a significant amount if he burns ult. However few things in League are as dreadful as _finally_ catching out that Ekko who is already a slippery assassin with potent CC and shields, only for him to ult away. Ekko survives situations he screwed up royally in and should die, even for a slippery assassins. \n\n> You've never played Ekko in your life. Not well anyway.\n\nProve this. Because I have played Ekko and I have done well with him. \n\n> \"If I lose its not fair\" reminder Ekko has to use his waveclear ability, dash, and assloads of mana early to hit that combo.\n\n> Your criticisms seem to have more to do with your \"feelings\" than with any actual numbers or facts.\n\nHis Q has a very low cooldown. He doesn't have much down time if he uses it to burst you. _And just like any other mana user, Ekko should have to pay for his spells._\n\nHis Q E combo is not fair for the enemy even if its \"costly\" for Ekko.\n\nI'm not bringing up facts as in numbers because I'm not worried about Ekko's winrate/playrate/banrate/builds/etc. \n\nI did however bring up facts. I listed out all of the things Ekko's force you to play around. Compare him to a champion like Xerath.\n\nYou must watch for the stun which isn't meaningful up close, deny him bonus mana from his passive, side step Q's, and be careful for when your low and he has his ultimate. You could include dodging his W but if he lands his stun your probably not going to be dodging his W .","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2017-08-31T20:28:54.694+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":8,"body":"Ekko's design is the most overloaded and unbalanced.
