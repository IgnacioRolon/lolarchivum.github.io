Rengar has only gotten this far because people [(like the guy who replied to you)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rengarmains/comments/6yxmbj/rengar_made_it_to_the_2nd_round_of_most_favorite/) post it to r/Rengarmains and then vote brigade. Imagine if the biggest Champion main subreddit, r/Rivenmains, vote brigaded to win. Riven would win hands down. (For reference, Rivenmains has 13885 subscribers and Rengarmains has 5768.)\nIt's just stupid that one very biased community has invaded the Boards and is distorting the results of this awesome Champion competition.\n\nPeople on there are even openly admitting to using smurfs to vote. The Rengar community has no honor and they're just cheating to win.
