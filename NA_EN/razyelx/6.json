It might get drowned out in the votes of others and get eliminated even though it's statistically the most popular.\n\nSo this isn't gonna be accurate.

I was wondering when someone will ask:D \n\nYes, you are right. Thats why I made a research on google and searched for which champions are most played, most picked and so on. From such data, I created the bracket in the system that 137 champions were line-up from the most picked to the lowest. Then I took for example Top 1 champion and putted him into Group A, next I took the lowest picked champion and putted him into Group A. Next i took second most picked champion and putted him in Group B... and so on, and on. This way in the **FIRST round** (that is running now) the \"more popular\" champions have a slightly better chance on getting to next round. And then in the next round, there will be random distribution (but I will get with the details, when it will be hapenning, its still too soon). And you know...if the champion is really the best, he will win anyway:) BUT LETS See.......","replies":[{"poster":"Faceroll Tactics","date":"2017-08-07T14:15:54.274+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh well I'm glad you put some thought into how to best make it work","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TheBentOn3","date":"2017-08-07T17:15:08.733+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Frickin Knife cat ulted in outta nowhere an just one shot my boy Tahms chances of getting to the next round.
