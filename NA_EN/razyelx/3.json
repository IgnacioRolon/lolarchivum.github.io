This time it was very hard and even battle. For a long time Thresh and Teemo had the same votes and every new vote counted. So after decades of battle between these two titans, Thresh decided to buy Oracle Alteration and the tide of battle quickly turned to his favor. So in the end our Lords soul was eaten by Thresh (even tho he doesn&#039;t have soul). I might only wonder into what Evilness is Thresh gonna evolve after absorbing Teemo... Well, lets go to last round of the QUARTERFINALS, where we have Ahri vs Azir. **LET THE BEST WIN**.\n\n**Trailer for the Battle:**\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_avwGiM3Lk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_avwGiM3Lk)\n\nAlso please check out my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMVxkqVcf2KPo8dYfRcchJA) and my [Twitch Channel](https://www.twitch.tv/razyelxgaming) and if you somehow like my content, leave a subcribe/follow, it will make me happy!:)\n\nThanks for every support!:)\n\n**BASIC INFO:**\n\nHello,\n\nwho is your favorite champion?

Wins every hottest female champion poll.\n2. Has THEE most rule 34 content then any other champion.  That includes Sona and Miss Fortune.\n3. Updated lore that includes not 1 but 2 extra stories.\n4. Is in the \"Art Of League Of Legends\" book.\n5. Is the protagonist of the \"New Dawn\" Cinematic.\n6. Is in most promotional artwork.  (Almost to the point if not already superseding Katarina.)\n7. Became the selected champion as the protagonist of the new star guardian skins.  (With new voice overs.)\n8. Became an announcer on both summoners rift and the invasion game mode.\n9. Got another promotional video in anime form for the new star guardian content.\n10. Got more coverage based on her development called \"Origins: Ahri.\"\n11. Was in the Top 8 of /r/leagueoflegends best champion contest.\n12. Is in the Top 8 of this best champion contest and the only female champion left in the running.\n\nAll these reasons alone are enough to trigger the ever living shit out of those that think she is the biggest mistake that has ever happened to the game and none of it even has anything to do with her as champion in-game which is another whole can of worms.\n\n**[Removed by Moderation]**\n\nSo her losing here will probably at least help them sleep better night.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"mkyner","date":"2017-09-23T00:18:43.537+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":18,"body":"Really?
