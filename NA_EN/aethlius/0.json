From checking on our end, it seems that you do have the Pulsefire Ezreal Summoner Icon, as well as others you have purchased on your account in your inventory.  Sometimes, the icons can get lost in the middle due to the sheer amount and are easy to scroll past.  \n\nCould you try just triple-checking line by line to ensure you aren't able to see it on your account?  If you can confirm its missing, can you list out exactly what icons you are unable to see in your list so I can possibly take some further actions?\n\nLet me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Aethlius","date":"2015-02-11T12:56:51.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"after the patch they all came back, or idk if you did something but they are there now and werent before.

Can you try seeing exactly which ones are missing and respond back to me with their names?

What about the Fizz icon for OCE that was said to be available on all servers?? I still haven't seen it. Don't have icons from DJ Sona on PBE either.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
