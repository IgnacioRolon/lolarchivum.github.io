A gap closer/escape that can be cast twice, slows, and damages. Another gap closer on his q, DOT, and reduced healing on his W, which hurts the more you attack them. A passive that lets him take less basic attack damage, and ignore unit collision, and an ult that slows and knocks up. \r\n\r\nPersonally I'd say either take out his damage on his e OR remove the slow, maybe also keep turret aggro if he playfuls. Another option would be to remove the DOT on his W.\r\n\r\nMaybe these ideas are awful, but for me there are only a handful of champions that are a must ban EVERY game, no matter what the team, and he's one of them. He's simply too slippery for the amount of damage he puts out. If anyone has any better suggestions I'd love to hear them, or at least create a discussion and explain to me how I'm wrong and he's fine as he is.","replies":[{"poster":"AORKDL26","date":"2015-01-14T17:24:52.173+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"You're wrong because you're a silver noob and you sound like the type of player to get me stuck in elo hell","replies":[{"poster":"DSRM Mobius","date":"2015-01-14T17:28:34.750+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"fizz is not going to get you out of elo hell.\nfor one thing he is band almot every game.\nand another if you do get to pick fizz that doesn't guarantee that you will win the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2015-01-14T22:52:16.481+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He doesn't need anything \"Taken out\" but he does need some work.\nRiot has said they will address issues with him and other assassins, so be patient.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DSRM Mobius","date":"2015-01-14T17:25:00.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fizz is already super squish\nif riot where to nerf him it probably be the damage on his E","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mooing Kev","date":"2015-01-14T22:56:11.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I say they need to rescale the cd on his E so it ends up having a 10 or 11 sec cd at lvl 5. 8 sec cd currently means with max cdr your trollpoling every 4.8 seconds which can get aggregating. Also make his q cd a flat 8 seconds at all levels. Just like his e his lvl 5 cd of 6 seconds lets him dashing every 3.6 seconds with max cdr. The point of these strong skills is that it should be timed and used at precise moments to get the most out of it. being able to spam it every 5 seconds degrades its value and obnoxious to play against.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DWT12345","date":"2015-01-14T19:07:23.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They should have his e still negate cc, but not damage, and increase the cooldown on it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hex the FenFen","date":"2015-01-14T19:03:59.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The biggest problem I face with Fizz is the fact that his Q applies the damage before he touches you most of the time, and if you dash away or use Caitlyn's net away from him while he is in mid Q you will still take the damage for it.","replies":[]}]}
