The time required for it to turn back on goes down from 9 to 6 down all the way to 4 seconds as well.\n\nMost of Miss Fortune's kit is done by other ADCs very similarly, but I'll compare directly to Graves. Each have one AOE semi-spammable basic for general purpose, except Graves can hit a whole team with his, not just two people and it is easier to use. Each have an attack speed steroid, except Graves has a very nice dash attached to his. Each have an AOE slow, except Graves actually does damage with his and makes it so they can't see anything as well. Each have an AOE ultimate, except you can't just walk out of Graves ult halfway through and it has very nice AD scaling.\nSo... out of all the things Graves has what does Miss Fortune have over him? The stacking DPS buff which is done better by other champs. Grievous Wounds which is niche  and also done by Tristana. And HER PASSIVE. Graves gets 10 in-combat MR and armor, MF gets to walk to lane faster. Oh wait that's hardly a niche.\n\nI basically only play Miss Fortune into skill shot comps and with Trinity Force+Lucidity Boots+Ghostblade to abuse her Q procs and DPS stacking W buff. But that is quite a small niche and tunneled build plus most players aren't going to recognize that is one of the only situations she isn't outclassed by Graves(and just barely).","replies":[{"poster":"Icy Auron","date":"2015-01-27T18:42:48.776+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"These are VERY valid points.

MF almost always has that bonus when roaming, which lets her quickly set up around objectives (or better, push a wave then run to an objective and make it in time to fight). Having it gated in fights is important to help to keep her overall power in check.\n\nIt also gives laning an interesting tension. The speed helps with dodging enemy skillshots, and let's you set up Q how you want.

What I mean by this is that your defining her niche as *\"the AoE teamfight ADC\"* isn't all that great when the sole source of that niche comes from an incredibly difficult to pull off **one-off R**. \n\nA powerful and devastating R if pulled off perfectly...but I disagree with it defining her in it's current state.  Hell from my experience, often times it's better to not think too hard about it and just blow her load early so that I actually used her R rather than dying without using it.\n\nLet's ignore the existence of {{champion:22}} whom I personally consider archaic and dated in design (just LOOK at her Passive!)\n\n**ADC's who have something that defines them often possess them when they need it, or have the capability express them often in a fight**. {{champion:96}} 's *\"magical artillery\"*-identity comes in the form of her basic ability W and spammy R. {{champion:42}}'s *\"mixed damage assault\"*-assault comes from his entire kit and Passive. {{champion:67}}'s *\"destroy everything in existence\"*-identity comes in the form of her Silverbolts. {{champion:236}}'s *\"uncatchable prick\"*-identity comes from his free spammy dash...although I'd argue he's recently been dethroned by Runaan's Kalista.\n\n\nMaybe if it's damage was heavily nerfed but compensated with a much lower cooldown to make it **spammier**.

However this is simply the sum of my experience playing all varieties of ADC. It's hard to see her as having any niche atm. **What defines her for me atm** is how she is the only one who lacks any of the 3 basic tools other ADC's have to stay alive. If you say her niche is AoE Teamfights, I can't argue with someone so much better at her than I am. But I will say that if this truly was the case, then it's not well pulled off due to that identity hanging solely off an overly conditional and one-off R.

Because unlike MF, Jinx is capable of unleashing a **CONSTANT** and **RELIABLE** form of AoE damage in the form of her Q. In fact, thanks to her Q, Jinx's AoE basically became her basic form of attack!

If I'm pushing an enemy minion wave or tower and I need to retreat, I'd much rather be an ADC with a dash. Hell, I'd even rather be Kog. At least his slow has a huge AoE, so it might actually stop someone from closing in. MF's passive won't do that if a minion decides that he dislikes me.\n\nGiven how her E is not exactly a standout CC ability, this is really her only decent escape mechanism, and it can be shut down extremely easily through no actions of her enemies. Making an escape from oncoming enemies before they get to you should be an interesting option her passive provides, but it often doesn't because you have few options for really controlling when it goes down. It's much more annoying, frustrating, and oftentimes useless than it needs to be.\n\nAs for things like chasing, that's something that enemy champions can often mitigate themselves with ranged abilities or attacks. This isn't going to be the change that makes her into a great chaser. It's still pretty easy to mitigate.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SunGold","date":"2015-01-27T21:15:15.327+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think it could preety interesting if her** w** would give her movemet speed boost. \nOr (not my idea) if her passive declined her movemt speed over time just like it increases over time.\n\nI kinda hate it when i'm on the teamfight i try to kill the enemy adc and lulu slows me down while draven speeds him self up to safety.and i can't catch up to anyone her range is not that hight but not that small still not enough dmag i could ulti if lulu dint had any cc like her ulti. she had. or other example cho gath silences me q and eats me and i'm dead.\nbut yes in lane miss fortune is not that bad, you have to wach your position and your river wards  cuz your passive is like the only thing that will save you if you can see an enemy trying to gank your lane.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"A little Peepo","date":"2015-01-28T11:43:26.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the concern is MF being a lane bully then take a look at caitlyn, why does caitlyn have 650 range and an escape with that range?

I mean, in theory it's great to have that free MS up whenever she needs to roam...in theory. However, the way I look at it is quite different. I believe the possession of this Passive dis-allows her from having any adequate escape/self-peel as a consequence. \n\nThe way I see it, ***OTHER CHAMPIONS gets their mobility/MS buff when they need it. But Miss Fortune loses it when she needs it MOST.***\n\nLet me elaborate on this.\n\nWhat are MF's weaknesses? She has low range, okay, then she can rely on self-peel, oh but she doesn't have any of that either, alright, then rely on escape mechanisms to help her escape...oh, wait no, her MS buff disappears when she REALLY needs it.\n\nCompare this to {{champion:119}}. Unlike MF, Draven's speed boost costs mana and isn't permanent. Sounds worst in theory right? Wrong, because he can choose to have it when he **NEEDS** it. Want to pursue? **Press W**. Oh shit, are you hurt and need to escape? **Press W**. Doesn't matter if your enemies are still shooting you, that MS boost is always going to be there for you.\n----------------------\nI feel that, whoever designed MF took into consideration the sheer mobility her Passive provides for her, and fear that giving her any form of self-peel or escape may make her over-bearing.\n\nUnfortunately, I also feel that she was designed in an era where everyone and their grandmother having a knock-up and multiple jumps/dashes was not the freakin norm.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VegetableFoe","date":"2015-01-28T13:22:36.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This.
