Any single instance of a flat value like health is going to matter more in the early game than it will in the late game because it represents a greater percentage of your total power at the time that you get it.

That's basically an extra autoattack early game, in exchange for hundreds of health lost especially coupled with the recent tank items nerf that's coming. \n\nI mean, imagine changing infinity edge to give 85 AD but its passive was changed to 220%.

It wouldn't feel good anymore.\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't mind so much if the damage of cinderhulk was buffed to compensate to make it a stronger mid-game item, but otherwise sunfire cape is starting to look better overall.

On devour the riot team commented that they would rather go and nerf champions individually rather than alter the item itself (which is kinda bad because if a champ was in a healthy state in lane this really forces them into the jungle) but then you nerf cinderhulk. Lets be realistic, Junglers will rush their jungle item 9 times out of 10. reducing the price isn't an inherent buff, the power spike is acquiring the preliminary jungle item, not the enchantment. the players ability to clear camps and make successful ganks will determine the final jungle item time in game. \n\nThe play style with jungler vs jungler. Cinderhulk is encouraging ganks. you have you jungle item, you are in a fairly healthy competitive spot in the game, time to try to cause some disruption in lane. Devour you are much more focused on getting your stacks. You are more focused on acquiring your stacks then you are of winnning lanes. Simply because once you have your stacks, the power spike is huge. very rarely are junglers meeting in jungle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Troy242621","date":"2015-08-20T15:05:21.118+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=H5cApt7p,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-08-20T03:54:06.915+0000)\n>\n> The Cinderhulk changes read as much more a nerf than they really are.

I gotta tell you. I don't buy Cinder for an early game power spike as a tank, or I'd just build Warrior's then gone tank. I buy it for mid/end game defense so I can survive longer than 4 autoattacks.

Was this more of a nerf directed at competitive play instead of YoloQ, since they build a lot of cinderhulk? Were these nerfs intended to bring Lee Sin back into popularity? If yes, you probably could have tweaked the warrior enchantment instead of nerfing cinder. I'm just curious as to the big changes.
