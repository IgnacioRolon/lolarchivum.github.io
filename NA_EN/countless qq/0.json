I just wanted to talk with you about sounds for just a moment, to kinda go into a bit more of an in-depth explanation than most other posts here.\n\nBack when Rengar was still on PBE I made a video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNU4Y9FcB9w\n\nThis goes over why the q sounds different/worse to many of us, the issue actually isn't the stab sound itself but a new sound that plays over it during the stab animation. Sounds don't even need to be reverted/changed, just certain files need to be rid of to make it sound like the old q again.  The q stab sound by itself is almost the exact same as the old one. Also, while the q sounds are important I think most of us would agree that the leap sound is the worst offender. The old jump sound would actually change based on if you jump at full ferocity or not, no such distinction exists anymore. In general it just sounds so much less satisfying to jump, he sounds more like a tiger now instead of a predator mixed with lion beast like he used to. Also, there is NO sound difference between w and empowered w, which is also quite odd as every other ability has sound differences between the normal and empowered ability, and one of the reasons we were denied having sounds changed in the past was \"clarity\" when there literally isn't a distinction between some of his abilities sounds like there used to be.\n\nAnywho, even if you guys just work on the particles in the end it still means a lot to us, thank you again for helping us, and sorry for any assholes who rage at you if not everything is completely reverted.","replies":[]},{"poster":"subhuman team XD","date":"2018-11-09T13:13:12.754+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have a website that saved all the sounds from all the way back in 2014 pretty much in the exact same format they were used with ingame :\n\n- Default Rengar Sound effects (all of them including R heartbeat and old leap/old q stab) : https://wiki.spectralcoding.com/info:lol_sound_pages:rengar_-_default\n\n- Headhunter Rengar Sound effects (aside from default sounds) : https://wiki.spectralcoding.com/info:lol_sound_pages:rengar_-_headhunter_rengar\n\n- Nighthunter Rengar's recall sounds : https://wiki.spectralcoding.com/info:lol_sound_pages:rengar_-_skin_2\n\nand if u wish to add more badass sound effects to the existing ones without damaging their originality , then be my guest , it would really make a huge difference when playing rengar","replies":[]},{"poster":"Enhhnn","date":"2018-11-09T03:10:14.835+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dear Riot Ranger XIV,\n\nAs a Rengar main since his release, I just wan't to say that his old sounds were the main reason why I enjoyed that champion.

I can't help but feel like the changes made to the sounds were just there for the sake of changing them, and when the entire community pleaded to bring the old ones back we were basically told \"f*** you\". Again I know I'm coming off as bitter and I really don't want to but I don't know how else to get my point across at this point.

Now when you play in-game its really hard to see the particles cause they are way too small and the colors are bad. On the pictures it looks like then are not missing but in-game its different!!!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DuIe Pacov","date":"2018-11-14T13:48:48.439+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Nice man, im agreeding with you completely.
