Her attack speed is already abysmal, and this change just makes it even worse. She won&#039;t even break 1.0 AS with Fishbones.\n\nDamage (with nerf) over 10 seconds assuming level 18 Jinx (no runes and masteries) with IE, LW, BT and PD vs random target (no armor).\n\nPowPow (525 range)\nAD with items: 304\nAS with items and buff: 1.4391\n14 attacks, 5852 damage\n\nFishbones ( 700 range, 110% damage)\nAD with items: 304\nAS with items and debuff: .83025\n8 attacks, 3678 damage per enemy hit with all 8 attacks\n\nSo for Jinx to deal as much damage with Fishbones as with PowPow, she will need to hit at least two people with each of her autos, which is probably not gonna happen.\n\nSo effectively, Jinx will have even worse problems in lane, while either being at close range (and thus vulnerable) in order to deal the amount of damage a regular ADC would, or being safe and dealing much less damage than any other ADC in teamfights.\n\nI think we can say that Jinx is no longer a hypercarry with this nerf.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-10-29T05:00:51.389+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":">So for Jinx to deal as much damage with Fishbones as with PowPow, she will need to hit at least two people with each of her autos, which is probably not gonna happen.\n\nIsn't... that the point?\n\nFishbones is explosions, collateral damage. Not a replacement for her autoattacks. If you want to deal single-target damage, why you wasting your rockets? \n\nI like Jinx, but I think I can see the point here. It's like any other ability that has a tradeoff, making it better in certain situations over others.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AD Yuumi","date":"2015-10-29T19:42:12.247+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"A few notes here\n\nA) Rockets are intended to be a safer option that offer far less DPS than the riskier minigun.

Now its just more accentuated. My only thing is that she still has that low base attack speed. Its ironic that the champ who has the most in-kit attack speed steroids in it benefits arguably the least from the stat especially now that she slows her own attack speed. If this does turn out to be a harder nerf then they expect a buff to her base attack speed would be nice rather than changing the % slow on the rockets which was the intention to begin with.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flaherty","date":"2015-10-29T04:58:36.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All the changes are going to be a lot different by the time they actually get implemented to live.

They could've just nerfed her rocket attack speed by 15% and walked away, she'd still be viable and probably even strong. Instead they compensate her by buffing her frequently complained about passive duration by 50%, and give it a 15% MULTIPLICATIVE attack speed modifier that stacks. \n\nI'm not even mad. I'm not sure if this is even a net nerf and if it is I gladly accept it in return for some added flavor and differentiation.\n\n> So for Jinx to deal as much damage with Fishbones as with PowPow, she will need to hit at least two people with each of her autos, which is probably not gonna happen.\n\n...naw, you've gotta be trolling.
