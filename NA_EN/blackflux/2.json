Why? .-.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":56,"down_votes":16,"body":"Why would {{champion:99}} need buffs? apart from her little shield thing she is kinda something that in several cases unless you go out of your way to get a {{item:3140}} or {{item:3222}} which can harm end game builds {{item:3139}}  is useful for AD though...is kinda op. well,past that I heard her ult is getting buffed. y&#039;know? the short cooldown ult that does like 1200 damage to ADC/supports/junglers/most mid laners not to mention the piercing snare,so her ult is almost always 1-2 free kills and even then the range is from one turret to another. almost every lux I see generally ends with something like 18/1/10 cause if you chase her she can slow then snare. but that&#039;s kinda her thing so there isn&#039;t much to nerf...but there definitely isn&#039;t much to buff! (again. shield,scaling is like 15 per skill point) I am sure riot won see this,but I would like to hear some thoughts on one of the most annoying champs(in my opinion)","replies":[{"poster":"Jet Sett","date":"2017-03-21T23:17:49.150+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"There's been an unhealthy amount of interaction in the mid lane and buffs to Lux are supposed to prevent this from occurring.","replies":[{"poster":"xevi","date":"2017-03-22T02:43:28.879+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty underrated if a joke","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fairyfleur","date":"2017-03-22T02:37:52.034+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":7,"body":"So, what you're saying is, her Q can easily hit _two_ squishy targets on the enemy team, and kill both of them with her ult and e? I'm sorry but unless the enemy team is garbage that won't ever happen, the frontline can bodyblock her snare and kill her during the channel of her ult. Also, her ult doesn't do 1200 damage, maybe her full combo could on a squishy, but not her ult alone. In addition, she is much outclassed by many other midlaners; like {{champion:69}} or {{champion:134}} .","replies":[{"poster":"AninLegions777","date":"2017-03-22T13:47:26.831+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"You guys keep talking like the fog of war doesn't exist. If you have played lux, you'd know that the easiest way to set up a kill is from a brush. Buy {{item:3364}} and sweep a brush the enemy team passes. Wait for them and pop off. It's not fcking rocket science. And in teamfights, people are busy trying to peel or dish out damage to notice the lux flanking them.

Nunu could delete your entire team with his ult alone from inside a bush and you'd have 0 time to react. If the enemy walks into an ambush like that it's on them, anyone with damage would delete them. That's why proper vision is so important.","replies":[{"poster":"AninLegions777","date":"2017-03-22T17:15:09.242+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you get suddenly slowed, I guess you should know what's coming next. And lux won't stand in one brush. She'll stand at the ward that is about to be warded. And then as you come within max range, it's GG. Also the major one is teamfights when everyone is grouped.

You could walk into the Nunu ult in the last tick and take all the damage the instant you get slowed.

Ok, first of if you manage to walk into a bush with a enemy lux in late/mid game ofc you will die the same can be said about all carry midlaners in the game. This buff wont even make lux close to being a top 5 midlaner since she doesnt have nearly as much dps as cass, guaranteed kill with syndra, waveclear and mobility of ahri etc. Lux is just in a very bad spot atm and is imo one of the weakest midlaners (in high elo).","replies":[{"poster":"BlackFlux","date":"2017-03-22T23:31:30.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"'Lux is just in a very bad spot atm and is imo one of the weakest midlaners (in high elo).'\nMeanwhile as riot buffs champions that overall in almost every rank besides the ones that are just 'pick the most OP thing,ban the rest and rank up' are viable\n{{champion:72}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:421}} exists after failed reworks or being nerfed into the ground. and I think I can prove my point a bit if you watch a few LCS games where champs like {{champion:117}} are always picked","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Swarovsko","date":"2017-03-21T23:29:03.486+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Wowowowowowwowwo someone talked about her weaknesses too, not just her strenghts. +1","replies":[]},{"poster":"Goku challenger","date":"2018-04-02T16:28:00.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Lux has a weak laning phase\" then how do players keep seeing lux has slain their mid laner on screen every minute while trying to gank her? is this because she has a \"weak\" laning phase?
