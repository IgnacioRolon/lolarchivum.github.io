I don&#039;t own morgana,i was about to buy her but she got in free rotation so I can do it later and maybe get {{champion:75}} or something to use my arch duke nasus shard. your also the glue. the very strong covering glue that blocks a ton of toxic stuff like &#039;gg we got no sup&#039; or something cause when there is no support that&#039;s like setting oil on fire or something,a rather harmless and small thing but one wrong step and that&#039;s exploding. I basically grab support every time nobody picks it. and that&#039;s how I have owned {{champion:80}} for a week and only used him twice. or once really as the second one was on ARAM like I had a choice.{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} \r\n\r\nnobody picks support","replies":[{"poster":"SchmidttyGames","date":"2017-02-16T03:33:27.141+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Support Role is the only one of the five that has an entirely different purpose than the other 4.

Kinda a case with {{champion:40}}. you have a stunning move but its hard to land,but its also useful to save people from chasing opponents. but then you have a big shield that protects from a ton of damage with morgs base being 350,but even then you can get {{item:3107}} and...um..that mastery that also increases shield power by 10%. so that's another like 70 power and the AP scale of morgs shield also give it more power","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Colton147","date":"2017-02-16T07:05:50.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a Support main, I love the role itself.

Unless you're gold or whatever, a lot of supports are just gonna be potatoes standing behind an adc doing pretty much nothing unless they're playing Blitzcrank or Thresh, but  as you go higher up you see them actually picking people out, ccing assassins, etc. I play ADC a pretty good amount, and even then I've only had a handful of supports that actually TRADE with the enemy laners as a ranged support, and try to skirmish/all in as a tanky support.\n\nIf you're good at the role you carry if your adc knows how to right click. If they don't, then go support your midlaner when the laning phase ends.","replies":[]}]}
