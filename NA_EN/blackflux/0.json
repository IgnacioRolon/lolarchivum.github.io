I have 50 wins in classic mode(still...partially new?) and chances are I keep my W/L like my FPS K/D. nearly one to one. but back to the subject,with said wins and losses I have played a ton of games. but Sion,Taric,and Ziliean I have yet to see. are they just unpopular? if you ask me I think they have great moves. {{champion:33}}+{{item:3075}} and your doing like 200 damage late game when people hit you {{champion:14}} I just feel is a good champ(especially when people don&#039;t know your passive or put ez in chat when they get a kill.) and {{champion:26}}. well he gets a 99% slow on little to no cool.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-02-07T01:53:20.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"taric is overpowered but nobody plays him cos he doesn't make le BIG MAGE PLAYS \n\nalso he's boring as shit","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-02-07T02:01:58.714+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"so like {{champion:40}} \n\nbut i do miss old taric...","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-02-07T02:15:28.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he's like janna but actually takes more than 5 minutes to master and not autopilot freelo\n\ni miss old taric too","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-02-07T02:22:17.553+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"new taric your are counter engage and reactionary ... old taric just smashed hammer and went ham","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2017-02-07T01:01:54.174+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"zilean and sion are always fun to play, even if you don't win tbh","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miror B","date":"2017-02-07T02:09:48.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd argue zilean is probably the \"funnest\" support mage you can play mid.
