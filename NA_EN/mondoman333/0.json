Be able to CS well -  you want to have at least 70 cs at 10 minutes (ideally, 80 or more). If your cs is very bad, practice in a custom game by yourself and keep track of your highest cs and try to beat that every time. You will eventually get better at it and reach this 70 cs goal. \n2. Be able to build the correct items -  this is the most standard ADC build I can give you that will work on every ADC: \nStart: Dorans blade , 1 hp pot\nBuild: Infinity Edge, Berzerker Greaves, Static Shiv, Bloodthirster, Last Whisperer , Guardian Angel\nNote :  if the enemy already has alot of armor built after u finish static shiv, build vamp scepter then last whisperer\n3. Learn how to kite - ADCs are extremely squishy as a result of building mostly DPS items so you need to learn how to kite to protect yourself and still manage to deal damage in teamfights. Heres a video i made for kiting.\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/awesomechad/c/5411659\n4. Position properly in teamfights - You are not going to run into the enemy 1v5 as an adc. You will get blown up pretty quickly. Position yourself behind your frontline and be close enough that you can still deal some dmg to the enemy via autoattacks or spells.\n\nIf you want other tips, you can watch my stream at www.twitch.tv/awesomechad  . I'm a  Diamond 3 ADC main and i do commentary on my games to help my viewers out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mondoman333","date":"2014-11-06T01:06:37.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would usually play any adc that comes out in the free champions, but otherwise I usually play tristana.

Keep stutter-stepping to the side until major CDs are down, then commit. \n\nIt'll honestly save you so many times against random ass skill shots if you just choose a random direction to move in.\n\nKeep track of enemy CDs, ADC will destroy any other class once they're on CD.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TonyTonyMordecai","date":"2014-11-05T04:09:37.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically what he said, try to kite if you see that the other ADC is winning the duel, or if you are walking away from tower, and jungler/ADC/support just came to lane.\nLast hitting is important, because it helps you get gold for items, and it will help you stay ahead in lane.\nLastly, which marksman are you using? Cause I can probably give you tips on how to utilize that ADC's kit to benefit you best in most matchups.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Commit Sudoku","date":"2014-11-05T03:52:28.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kite likaboss attack what is safest to attack (usually the closest enemy)","replies":[]}]}
