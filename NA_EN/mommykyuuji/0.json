There are games where I forget to /mute all and they become a problem. Overall I start being really passive aggressive like \"wow youre a freaking legend\" \"this guy is so good wtf\" and then I move onto just saying \"you're delusional\" in general. I don't need comments saying that I'm toxic because I realized that when I got my first ban back on my permabanned account. I just want tips to staying cool and how to deal with unpleasant teammates.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-06-05T02:48:35.636+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yes, insults and passive aggressiveness is a punishable offense.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-05T03:36:48.727+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The problem isn't necessarily that you made a passive-aggressive comment, per se - you have to ask yourself whether you were arguing with teammates, regardless of the exact words you used. Visualize your chat log with everyone else's chat removed. Do you spend a lot of time contributing to pointless bickering? Are the things you say relevant to winning the match? Are you helping tilt your team, or un-tilt them? If you look at the things you say and think, \"this isn't going to help the situation,\" then those messages are unnecessary and might contribute to a punishment.\n\nIf a match is getting under your skin, talk to a friend or significant other. A sympathetic ear or warm hug (or more, mehehehe) goes a long way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-06-05T10:50:20.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once you stop taking wins overly seriously, you'll feel the weight off your shoulders. \n\nNo one is going to become a pro if you won/lost that game. It's not going to be $10,000 of tournament money or your livelihood.  \n\nYes it feels good to win,  try to problem solve on how to play from behind, but a loss (or bad plays) is not something you need to lose your temper over.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lunamorie","date":"2019-06-05T09:27:19.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At the end of the day its just a game and and teamgame at that.\nGetting mad or upset at your team for not being  good/ bad move or maybe there just having a bad game is not the way to go about it.I know it can be hard to not want to say something some times but raging wont help them feel better about all readying knowing there not doing so hot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ph03n1xb1rd","date":"2019-06-05T13:19:50.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Saying anything what somebody else does not like is bannable.\n\nAnd simply do not use the chat at all, then you are safe.","replies":[]}]}
