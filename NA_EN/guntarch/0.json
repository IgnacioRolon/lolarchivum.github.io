After receiving text chat restrictions due to his conduct online, i forbade him from playing any more on my user account, until recently.  He said that he had changed and no longer sent texts.  My rule was that if he was going to use my account he would have to obey that rule, no use of chat.  \r\n\r\nHe did not obey this rule and flamed people on two games: ( Chat text below) then went on this forum and complained about being banned.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow i Log in to find my account is perma-banned and I had nothing to do with it.  Please re-enstate my account that i have spent money on RP and supported riot through my time on this game (hence why i have so many champions and skins etc.)\r\n\r\nAlso note that my brother no longer lives with me and obviously will therefor not be ever allowed to play my user account again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nPre-Game\r\nGuntarch: dont ban galio pls\r\nIn-Game\r\nGuntarch: yeah def\r\nGuntarch: reporting wukong for no skin\r\nGuntarch: :D\r\nGuntarch: D:\r\nGuntarch: what are you doing wukong\r\nGuntarch: did you not see their whole team?\r\nGuntarch: ....\r\nGuntarch: irelia\r\nGuntarch: stop talking\r\nGuntarch: and camp tower\r\nGuntarch: what are yo looking at wukong\r\nGuntarch: gg no jungler, no bot, no top\r\nGuntarch: so pathetic she said that...\r\nGuntarch: cant get better if you play the victim :(\r\nGuntarch: this guy was in another game on my team and fed then too\r\nGuntarch: reported rock marine before for inting / feeding\r\nGuntarch: should not be playing ranked game\r\nGuntarch: should stick to eating crayons\r\nGuntarch: dude\r\nGuntarch: 0/5/0\r\nGuntarch: stop inting\r\nGuntarch: definitive\r\nGuntarch: lol\r\nGuntarch: i have had mid camped all game because no other lanes\r\nGuntarch: gg was fun for about 5 minutes\r\nGuntarch: think top / sup first time\r\nGuntarch: this is ranked right?\r\nGuntarch: deep hatred for brand *shrugs\r\nGuntarch: i would never ff to you as a laner\r\nGuntarch: i love still doing better than my laner with a fed team vs int team\r\nGuntarch: yi isnt evne playign\r\nGuntarch: sure\r\nGuntarch: as soon as you end the game\r\nGuntarch: pls report karma and irelia\r\nGuntarch: thanks\r\nGuntarch: not at all\r\nGuntarch: you are way more toxic than me\r\nGuntarch: but that is cool\r\nGuntarch: should still report irelia and karma\r\nGuntarch: if you think about it they ruin the game :(\r\nGuntarch: didnt verbal abuse. that is absure\r\nGuntarch: absurd.\r\nGame 2\r\nPre-Game\r\nGuntarch: he can\r\nIn-Game\r\nGuntarch: its actulaly not bad\r\nGuntarch: last hit cannon minions with it when you have 1 charge in shiled\r\nGuntarch: to garuntee getting them\r\nGuntarch: why do you play master yi\r\nGuntarch: u ever going to gank?\r\nGuntarch: man\r\nGuntarch: worst jungler in 10 games :(\r\nGuntarch: i am\r\nGuntarch: she has range and i dont though\r\nGuntarch: nah\r\nGuntarch: im done\r\nGuntarch: no\r\nGuntarch: sigh\r\nGuntarch: take bot tower\r\nGuntarch: group up and kill it\r\nGuntarch: so bad\r\nGuntarch: stfu\r\nGuntarch: im just tired of carrying games eveyr game\r\nGuntarch: then i have a bad start and every lane is braindead\r\nGuntarch: so tiresome\r\nGuntarch: 17/20 games won\r\nGuntarch: and yet i sit in bronze\r\nGuntarch: terrible jungler\r\nGuntarch: no obj control\r\nGuntarch: no teamwork\r\nGuntarch: just terrible\r\nGuntarch: 1v3 and you guys still cant fight a 4v2\r\nGuntarch: so sad","replies":[{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2019-01-25T00:03:01.905+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is exactly why account sharing is against the rules in the first place.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DerMangoJoghurt","date":"2019-01-25T00:02:18.851+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if that story were true, account sharing is punished with a perma ban in the first place.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iron4playa","date":"2019-01-25T00:01:30.403+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunely that's the price you pay for letting someone else on your account, the punishment would not be revoked because someone else was on your account.

It's your fault for lending an item to someone who doesn't respect it enough to take care of it. It's his fault for not taking care of it.\n\nHe's the one who will have to pay you back.
