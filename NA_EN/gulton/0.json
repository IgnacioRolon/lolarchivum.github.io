This all started after I upgraded my Hard Drive from a 500 GB one to a 1 T because I was having some issues with the old one. ( Disk usage was always 100%) and I couldn't fix it in any way, and basically couldn't use my computer because of it. After I changed it and isntalled a clean version of Windows 10 it looked like the problem was solved, but the thing is that even after changing my hard drive I still get the disk usage up to 100%. I can install any other program, but when it comes to league it will always crash my computer. I've tried everything, and even the repair tool crashes. I would really need some help {{item:3070}}  {{item:3070}} \n\nPd: English is not my first lenguage so sorry for that :p","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-08T22:15:13.007+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's strange to hear that it's taking so much processing power to install or update, and is pretty unusual.
