I&#039;m complaining about it consistently deciding the game outcome based on who gets filled where. Here&#039;s why it&#039;s a terrible idea:\n\n1. We don&#039;t even get the option to opt out and decide for ourselves that we don&#039;t think its worth it to risk getting placed in our worst role in exchange for queue time.\n\n2. I&#039;m sure MOST people would want to sacrifice a few minutes of their queue times to avoid autofill.\n\n3. We&#039;ve been playing Dynamic Queue for about half a year without this restriction so many of us who knew how to play their worst three roles at a level at least one tier below their rank in the past DON&#039;T KNOW HOW ANYMORE. The damage has already been dealt.\n\n4. Yeah I&#039;ve won several games because the enemy 1-trick Akali got filled to ADC, but I detest games that are decided by factors like this. NO ONE likes volatility. It&#039;s the reason why people ban champions with sub-50% winrates. They&#039;re scared of the random Leblanc that will solo carry a game even though most of the time, it&#039;s not an issue.\n\n5. Games are volatile, as one player can drag an entire team down more in this season than ever before.\n\nI&#039;ve got a D2 account and a Master account so it&#039;s a bit less than 1% of playerbase affected I&#039;d say so Riot can just shrug it off. BUT A SIMPLE FIX. Oh, and by the way, I&#039;m writing this during my dodge timer after my one-trick Zac got autofilled support while my one-trick Darius got autofilled mid.\n\n\nEdit: Most of you bring up the point of autofill creating sustainability in queue times and reference the start of the season where queue times were extremely excessive. Again, the fix I'm suggesting preserves BOTH the values of short queue time and higher match quality/good role select. You DON'T HAVE to opt out. You can simply leave autofill on and enjoy your shorter queue time IF you value that more than your risk of getting filled. IF autofill were on for everybody (like it is now), the people that can deal with it and fill will STILL get their games potentially ruined by their teammates who CANNOT. If you try to make sense of it, you will conclude that the longer queue times that this solution yields are the results of people that are GUARANTEED TO RUIN MATCH QUALITY, not have the potential possibility to. You essentially ELIMINATE the ENTIRE complaints threads for autofill. \n\nAnother point regarding queue times is that autofill was implemented roughly the same time as other queue time fixes were implemented so it is a confounding factor in all of this as the other fixes (which you guys haven't mentioned) have been huge in cutting our queue times (not just autofill). These are factors like limiting premade size (to 3) and making MMR boundaries stricter for premades and tweaking matchmaking system algorithm's metrics (MMR, Primary Role Placement, Premade Size, Leniency). \n\nAnd for those of you saying we can just ask our teammates for their roles; it will work sometimes, but less frequently now. I can refer you to the 3rd point I made in the post. Also, it happens to multiple people at the same time. Almost every champion select I get into, the first words I see in chat are \"fucking autofilled.\" ALMOST. EVERY. TIME.

A lot of the issues earlier on in the season were solved gradually with cutting premade sizes in Dia+ and adjusting the metrics of the matchmaking system (MMR, roles, premade pairing, leniency). It's hard to tell because autofill came in at the same time as these changes leading it to be confounding.","replies":[{"poster":"Locke Daemonfire","date":"2016-08-12T16:08:27.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are certainly a lot of factors that can influence the queue times, so I agree that it's hard to know exactly what would happen with any change.  The estimated queue time based on role is another thing they've since added that could change how people queue if they see long wait times.\n\nYou know, I think that with effective communication, they could test an 'opt out of auto-fill' option, or other solutions.  If they say beforehand that it's a test for like a week, and highlight options for decreasing the queue time for players who value that aspect higher, it might not go over so poorly.  Especially with the potential benefit.  And we'd get to see what would happen either way.  My belief is that they have models to estimate queue times, and have chosen not to remove auto-fill because the trade-off is too great.  But in the end, they're just simulations - human behavior can be unpredictable.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aazzlano","date":"2016-08-12T15:21:41.788+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"A ranked game where your players are playing roles they don't play at all is not a game worth playing AT ALL. I'm sure if a player one-tricks something or strongly mains 2 roles but doesn't play the others gets autofilled, they would rather not play that game AT ALL. It's not only a waste of time because they lose (and thus wasted the time of their previous win as well) but it's NOT FUN to play that role (which is why they don't play it) \n\nFor me, I'd rather sit and wait for 40 extra minutes in queue for the theoretical game to finish than for it to place me as ADC or something. And I'm sure all of my teammates would rather I'm not on their team as ADC. They can wait another few minutes for another ADC player, I guarantee they would all be okay with actually having someone who plays the role be on their team with it.  \n\nThe problem is that this is happening in high MMR where there are less players to pick from, and where the skill disparity between player's roles is much bigger. Like what if in LCS or Worlds they were like oh, well, someone who is a star mid player just got autofilled to ADC. They don't play that role. They can most likely play it better than most players in the world, but they don't play it at the level that they are competing at. Same thing here. I can play ADC at a level higher than most players in the world (statistically 95%+) since I'm simply a better player... but compared to other players at my rank, my ADC is shit. And that's the problem, you can't just have someone 'get better at other roles'. \n\nWhen you are at a certain ranking because you got there by playing only your main role/champions, how are you expected to suddenly play a role you don't play at all and still do well? And play it vs people who got there with that role as their main? Like wtf. And not even like every game, just randomly. Oh and then some of your games when you get your main role, the enemy got autofilled there so you just smash them, and learn nothing and in fact go backwards in skill because you learn bad habits from facing lower leveled players of that role. That's literally just luck, and nobody wants that factor in their ranked games. People want to be judged on their skill level and climb because they are skilled.","replies":[{"poster":"Locke Daemonfire","date":"2016-08-12T15:52:34.393+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not saying it's not bad to be in a game in the wrong role if you're a one-trick.  I'm saying that it is unsustainable for all the high MMR players to be one-tricks.  Before they put in autofill, they showed queue times of 20, even 30 minutes for the highest tier.  And at the time, they also admitted that matchmaking was giving poor match quality in terms of people's ranks.  To have good matches with respect to both rank and roles, the queue times would probably have to be several times that, and measuring a queue time in hours is just unreasonable.\n\nLCS is obviously completely different than Solo/DynQueue.  If you want that experience, then you're going to have to find your own team to queue with in ranked teams, a support in particular because there just aren't enough to go around.\n\nMost players are going to have to go back to whatever they did before Season 6, once they reach the point where they run into autofill.  Some number of players like yourself who would rather wait 40 minutes can dodge when they get autofilled, and that's fine.  But if everyone was so inflexible the queue would grind to a halt.","replies":[{"poster":"Aazzlano","date":"2016-08-13T00:13:24.148+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The old system was better lol.

And I have a lot of champs at around 20-40 games so they all add up to about ~525 games.\n\nWith all the games added, considering I preferred mid for the majority of Season 3 (I mained mid but played Eve both mid and jungle) I only didn't get Eve or mid in ~200 games.

I have 12 additional games as Ezreal but I played him mid, didn't play him ADC. \n\nAutofill isn't like the old system. In the old system, everyone was used to forming a team with the strongest players on their preferred roles and the roles left over were distributed to whoever else capable. Now you just get thrown as a random role, and hey good luck! You might be able to get people to swap with you, but in the old system, anyone could have been a player of any role/lane. Now, if you get autofilled, you are guaranteed that not a single player on your team plays that role, because well thats why you got autofilled into it. That's a big difference. And again, someone might be able to play it as their 3rd or 4th best role, but when the enemy team mains that role you just get stomped. At that level you can't mess around like that.

The influence of a support is less than any other position in the game, meaning that climbing is much harder from support than it is in any other position. Because of this, there WILL always be less supports in all elos, just because there are less support mains because players want to be able to directly influence the outcome of the game. ATM I am plat 1 with 32,472 players in the NA server above me. That is not a very big number at all.

Your top will not trade you so you are stuck.\n\nMeanwhile the other team has a extra person who is alright with jungling sometimes as their third most desired position but is in the same boat as you but they got top instead. \n\nSince you are not on the same team and the current system does not take into consideration anything besides the 2 positions that a person listed it is not going to be able to use anything else to make things better.\n\nIf they had you list most preferred to least preferred that would at least make it far less likely for you to get your least desired position.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2016-08-12T17:39:00.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know why auto fill came about though right?

Group Queuing is still a huge factor causing the problems we are seeing. If you allow people to group together, that effectively knifes off a portion of a small population, limiting the matchmaker severely. This is why Riot had to reduce premade size at high ELO. Further, I don't have the numbers to say this for sure, but I strongly suspect the composition of groups is nowhere near balanced role-wise. This further stresses the matchmaker as it pulls from the reduced pool to fill the premade matches, exacerbating imbalances in the general solo population. This is why Riot had to implement auto-fill.\n\nIf you still don't understand, I can't really help you. I'd give you the mathematical formulas I used to run a Monte Carlo simulation to confirm my theory is viable, but you likely wouldn't be able to use them.","replies":[{"poster":"Jorencice","date":"2016-08-12T22:03:25.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol.

Of course, when the queues actually get long, then suddenly it doesn't seem so great anymore. At the start of the season, there were wayyy more people complaining about long queue times in high elo than I've ever seen complaining about autofill.\n\nBad queue times make people quit playing a game mode faster than anything else. Maybe they will go to a smurf or just stop playing altogether. But few people want to spam games at 30-40 min queues, which then in turn makes the queues worse for everyone else. \n\nWe had autofill every game for the past 5 seasons. This current system is clearly an improvement over that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2016-08-12T21:26:52.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tl;dr OTP's get rekt with autofill","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sammystorm","date":"2016-08-12T20:32:36.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is posts like this that got us DQ in the first place.
