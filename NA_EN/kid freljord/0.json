In order to get your budget's worth of power you gotta position to get either two allies and one enemy, or two enemies and one ally\n\n{{champion:37}} **Aria of Perseverance**'s power budget is mostly hidden in the resistances it grants a whole team, but in lane is used to heal *very small* amounts of health over a period of time. It's spammable and mana-hungry, yet doesn't outright erase damage.\n\n{{champion:12}} **Triumphant Roar** heals everyone and their grandmother in the nearby area. It doesn't have much power alone and most of it goes to Ali himself, but it does heal minions, helping with pushing and denying some CS early game if you're lucky/smart.\n\n{{champion:16}} **Astral Blessing** is a single target high-yield heal with a temporary armor buff. It's current power is offset by **HIGH** cooldowns and manacost\n\n**(Note that Sona's and Soraka's abilities are gated(cooldown and mana), where as Nami's and Alistar's abilities are power-conditional(Can't just use on an ally to get your powerbudget's worth). I feel like this is an important distinction to keep in mind)**\n\nGood deal, right? So what's wrong with Soraka's heal? Sure it's bursty but it only targets one ally and costs a boatload of mana.\n\nWell, a couple of major points wrong with it. First off is that Soraka's core fantasy (Medic!) forces most of her power budget into her W and Ult, making the other abilities sorta lackluster on their own. This leads into another major issue, the optimal play style of Soraka in lane; PASSIVENESS.\n\nNow I'm not denying the power of stacking AoE MR shred, it kills in teamfights, but in lane you really can't use it without; putting yourself up front and in serious risk (damn girl you is the squish), pushing the lane no matter what, and inadvertently denying your own carry some CS. Her Infuse can be a nice harass tool in lane if leveled first, but most Sorakas are going to opt for heal first. Thus it's main use during laning is simply to interrupt and prevent action.\n\nWith all this in mind, that means the optimal way to play Soraka during the laning phase is **super-passive-topoff-stayaway-farmfest-funtime!** This is extremely frustrating for everyone else involved. It's a decreased chance for plays to happen and for lane opponents to meaningfully interact. Sure the other supports I mentioned could do this to some extent, but their power lies in the entirety of their kits; Nami for unbelievable kiting, Alistar for CC/Displacement, Sona for insane pokes and teamwide engagement through ER.\n\nThe kit needs to be brought in line to work *with* and not *against* the structure of the game **without ruining the core fantasy of medic.** If a lot of power needs to go into Astral Blessing to fit the fantasy, then it must either be heavily gated (as is now), or power-conditional.\n\nYou can't really make a dedicated heal spell interactive, so it needs to go through another part of her kit in someway, a part of her kit that DOES provide interaction. An example below;\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** Numbers and effects below are pure conjecture and may need changing in order to be considered balance.\n\n| Ability | Name | Effect |\n|-\n|(Passive) http://i.imgur.com/2EA0naM.png | Salvation | Offensive abilities weakens the resolve of their targets, reducing their damage output by 5/10/15% for 2 seconds. Any damage applied with weakened resolve blesses the ally champion hit with Astral Essence|\n|(Q) http://i.imgur.com/CJ8Qq6Q.png | Starcall | Calls down an astral being to the target area dealing 60/95/130/165/200 *(+50% Ability Power)*  magic damage.|\n|(W) http://i.imgur.com/ALvytBW.png | Astral Blessing | Heals a single ally  for 65/95/125/155/185 (+ 30% AP) and increases their armor by 50/65/80/95/110 *(+15% Ability Power)*. **If the target ally is blessed with Astral Essence, the blessing is consumed and the amount healed is doubled.**|\n|(E) http://i.imgur.com/6ADYApR.png | Infuse | On Ally Cast: Soraka drains 5% of her maximum mana to restore 20/40/60/80/100*(+5% maximum mana)* mana to her target ally. **If the target ally is blessed with Astral Essence, the blessing is consumed and the amount restored is doubled.** On Enemy Cast: Soraka silences the target for 1.5/1.75/2/2.25/2.5 seconds and deals 40/70/100/130/160*(+ 40% AP)(+5% maximum mana)* magic damage to them.|\n\nWith the iteration above the heal shouldn't be gated so heavily as it's pretty lackluster to cast individually. It's as strong as a single bounce of Ebb and Flow. Instead it's now power-conditional; using Starcall or Infuse offensively allows you to supe up your heal/manasustain giving you incentive to be interactive in lane. The kit also flows together better and hopefully allows for more interesting plays. Cooldowns would still have to be worked out.\n\nOr I could be completely out of my head and this whole post is ridiculous...","replies":[{"poster":"Vesh","date":"2014-04-21T20:04:31.788+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is a really really well done analysis. Like seriously. It's true that a dedicated heal spell cannot really be interactive. However, maybe there is some cool space to make a heal that is somehow enemy-interactive. Nami's does this to some degree, and I tend to think it's one of the better designed heals in our game.\n\nI actually think your older idea for her passive had a better direction. Damage reduction feels really shitty for everyone involved and is incredibly powerful for how unappreciated it is. \n\nIn general we want to create interactive gameplay *patterns*. It's acceptable for a single spell to have little to no interaction provided it is a part of an interactive pattern. Currently Soraka's W is not this. \n\nI'm working on a couple of different pattern directions currently and have tried a few others that have failed. \n\nYour goals for starcall being important to the overall pattern are good, but also remember that starcall by itself has low overall gameplay/counterplay. There might be something cool we can add to the rest of the pattern that makes a simple heal an integral part of interacting with enemies.

In order to make the sustain use case less appealing, X needs to be set lower than what you would get with a regular heal (since your maximum possible swing is 2X), but if you do that, you weaken her ability to do a clutch save on an ally who's being burst down, since you can only mitigate X of a burst.\n\nPersonally, what I'd like to see is have Astral Blessing grant a shield, lifesteal, and spell vamp (possibly only granting the latter two on damage dealt to champions; alternatively, she could grant healing amplification a la Spirit Visage).  Because there's no direct healing, the shield strength can be high, maintaining her ability to do clutch saves on a focused ally.  The lifesteal/spell vamp means that it can function effectively as a heal, but only if the target is interacting with the enemy.  It also introduces counterplay: If you see the shield placed on your target, you switch from applying damage to applying CC, in order to prevent the target from taking advantage of the healing effect.\n\nIncidentally, I am very much not a fan of the %max mana effect on Infuse; I don't think I've ever seen a Soraka build a substantial amount of mana to take advantage of this, at which point it seems like it's locking in power that could be better spent on more exciting things.  I'd much rather see an interaction with Starcall, such as the following:\n\nInfuse: On enemy cast, doubles the number of Starcall stacks on the target, and then deals damage (her current base + AP scaling for this ability, or maybe something a little lower) and silences for 1/1.25/1.5/1.75/2 seconds + 0.1 second per Starcall stack.  (Alternatively, the damage and silence could be dealt first, and then the Starcall doubling could take effect.)\n\nThis introduces a new tradeoff in when to use Infuse; do you use it earlier to accelerate Starcall stacks on the target, or do you use it later to get a stronger direct effect?\n\nAnother thing that bugs me about Infuse is that while the dual ally/enemy cast is a great mechanic in theory, in practice by the end of the game (teamfight phase), you will always be saving your Infuse for the silence, because the mana simply isn't worth it by then.  I'd be willing to give up the uniqueness of mana sustain (which admittedly is a very nice, unique early-game benefit) for something similarly unique that is more relevant throughout the game.  Ideas:\n\nInfuse: On ally cast, doubles the number of Starcall stacks (more on this later) on the target, and then reduces the duration of existing CC by 0.5/0.6/0.7/0.8/0.9 second + 0.05 second per Starcall stack\n\nInfuse: On ally cast, doubles the number of Starcall stacks on the target, and then reduces the cooldown of the next spell cast by 5%/6.25%/7.5%/8.75%/10% + 1% per Starcall stack\n\nSpeaking of, yes, I think Starcall should be adjusted to affect allies; allies hit by Starcall receive 1/1.5/2/2.5/3 MR per stack (like her old passive); double the mana cost of Starcall, but have it return half of the mana spent if an enemy unit is hit.  This makes it possible but very expensive for her to buff her team before a teamfight, while still preserving her ability to brush check.  I'm guessing for overall power reasons, you might need to remove the cooldown refresh for Astral Blessing, but that's an acceptable tradeoff for more interactions with Infuse.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-04-21T21:21:51.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is being passive really that bad?

Soraka's current W does this to some degree because it grants massive amounts of armor which is only useful in combat but also causes the enemy to re-evaluate their targeting decisions. Unfortunately, for the armor to be powerful enough to matter, we had to take away raw healing power. I believe that players who want to play the healer character probably want big heals.

So, instead of a small heal and a significant armor buff, Soraka's heal granted a lot more health but also gave her teammates an armor/mr debuff for a short amount of time (possibly 2-3 seconds).\n\nI know you're trying to avoid making Soraka a \"top them off\" type of healer who prefers to between fights rather than during them, but consider it this way: heal spells will be used to top off champions in between fights regardless of how you change them.  By giving it a short debuff, it allows the enemy team to react to the spell correctly and try to eliminate the effects of a heal.  It also means that a Soraka player has to be very careful while selecting her targets DURING fights, because picking the wrong target could get your teammate killed.  \n\nIt may seem like this would encourage passive play during team fights, but without her heal Soraka is almost irrelevant in team fights.  Soraka would eventually have to make the decision to try to heal someone to keep them alive in a fight or just be a useless champion.  This also would act to provide some counterplay to the current poke-heavy meta and encourage the enemy team to dive in.\n\nFurthermore, if you worry about putting a debuff on a team-targeted spell, what if you put an mr/armor buff that negates the debuff onto her E.  This creates more of a decision for Soraka players during team fights: do I want to heal and then protect (while giving mana to) a single teammate, or do I want to heal and then silence an enemy to prevent them from using a powerful spell?\n\nMaybe not a perfect idea, but I think it creates counter play while simultaneously allowing Soraka to be a dedicated healer type of champ and shifting some power away from her currently freakish team-fighting ability and back into laning phase.","replies":[{"poster":"Kid Freljord","date":"2014-04-22T14:10:00.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The idea of an ability that debuffs an ally sounds rather toxic.

W is no longer a cast and forget type of spell.

And honestly, if she has solid counterplay a degree of passiveness can be allowed.  Because as long as you have 3 out of your 4 abilities being team healing focused, you just can't generate a powerful interaction with her and an enemy when 3/4ths of her interaction is with her teammates.  You can't change the current Starcall to be interactive in a duo lane and not oppressive in a solo lane either, due to it's nature on top of her own nature.  If you increase the range, she just abuses melees in a solo lane even more, if you make it stronger you punish melees for jumping her insanely hard, if you amp it's ability to reduce her CDs on W, you run into the fact Raka has **** poor mana management for herself if she is going into a fight that is only fixed by dedicatedly itemizing mana regen... using a LOT of gold support raka just doesn't have access to.\n\n\n\nHonestly, her PBAoE nature of her Q with auto targeting with 0 downtime is probably one of the biggest things which will prevent her from ever having an interactive fighting nature.  No way to dodge it ever, and it has no (significant) CD, so if it's strong, its overbearing, if it isn't, it's worthless.  Which is why we see Mid-Raka be so toxic, while support raka can't even level the skill effectively.  Perhaps changing her Q to be a DoT around her where her Q falls repeatedly over the duration, keeping the feel of the skill of repeated star-falls, but has an actual CD, would put an actual downtime, and therefore power allowance, into the skill.

You could also afford to give it more strength to feel worth putting ranks into, as now it could have a respectable base damage.  It also gives her a \"down time\" in her damage, meaning in a solo lane no longer does she never have a weak point in a fight, and it would be possible to bait out her damage with an escape after she tries to start it up, unless she puts herself at a MUCH greater risk by directly walking up in melee range of the target before starting her Q.\n\nAnother thing I could see would be something like Anivia's ult on her Q.  She can toggle it, but if she toggles it off it has a decent CD, and channel breaking CC can also knock it off if she turns it on.\n\nEDIT:  Another idea could be for every enemy nearby, her Q range increases.

My biggest concern is that they encourage Soraka to do other things BEFORE she heals, reducing her ability to react to unexpected situations (especially before level 6). Mitigating unexpected damage is (I think) an important aspect of the dedicated healer fantasy (and one of the things that makes healing unique from shields), and for that you need a large degree of control over where you put your heal, and when. It needs to be something you decide based on who needs healing, and when they need it the most, and I think it needs to be there when you click, if at all possible.\n\nAnother problem is that stacking encourages longer periods of engagement, which is more than what’s necessary to fix the non-interaction problem in lane. Plenty of champions interact in lane by poking and attempting to avoid retaliation. Also, it sounds like the resistance shred from Starcall already seems to provide plenty of incentive for sustained combat in teamfights. If possible, I think it would be best to leave the stacking mechanic for beefier supports (Alistar seems like a very good candidate).\n\nOne possible idea is a sort of martyrdom mechanic, but not in the way that was described earlier in the thread. It would go something like this (but with better names):\n\nPassive: Hitting enemy champions grants Soraka a stack of [Astral Payment], up to a maximum of 2(3?). Any stack of [Astral Price] gained will cancel out one stack of [Astral Payment], removing each other.\n\nAstral Blessing: Heals an allied champion for [much healz], but places 2(3?) stacks of [Astral Price]. If any stacks of [Astral Price] remain on Soraka after [not many] seconds, Soraka loses [ouch*] health for each stack, and all stacks are removed. Any stack of [Astral Payment] gained will cancel out one stack of [Astral Price], removing each other.   *The health loss might be best as a percentage of max hp, to prevent any trivialization through hp itemization.\n\nNote: This mechanic would happen instead of the armor buff, with more power going into the actual heal. I’m not sure how self-heals should be tuned. Also, I allowed the stacks to proc on any hits instead of just Starcall. In its current state, the low cooldown on Starcall makes it no big deal to force the player to use it in close proximity to Astral Blessing, but if Starcall changes into something with a longer cooldown (or unreliable application), then you run into the same problems I was bemoaning earlier in my comment. Soraka would have to consider the availability of Starcall before deciding whether her ally (who is about to die!) should get a heal.\n\nOne advantage to this setup is that it would force Soraka to expose herself to enemy harassment one way or another. If tuned properly, avoiding the enemies in lane will hurt just as much as engaging them, without the corresponding benefits. It also gives the opponent some of their satisfaction back when she chooses to heal from safety, because they can see that their attacks are making it to her health bar, even if the path they take to get there is a little longer. Another advantage is that, in situations where there are too many enemies to approach safely , such as a soured teamfight or a jungler gank, Soraka can still deliver her full heal, and pay a more manageable cost than getting her face ripped off. This also lumps all of the spell’s healing into one point of application, allowing the player to focus on who needs healing, and when, and having that healing available on demand. This just might allow Soraka to fulfill the dedicated healer fantasy without forcing her lane opponents to go make a sandwich and come back later. \nContinued….","replies":[{"poster":"Gamue","date":"2014-04-23T23:17:41.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One big problem with my setup is that an opponent with on-demand crowd control can prevent Soraka from avoiding the damage after her heal. This would be fine, except that it gives the Soraka player no incentive to approach them, lest she eat harassment damage on top of her own stacks. I suppose the stacks could be removed upon enemy crowd control, but that would make for less counter-play to a kit that already has a lot of inevitability. Another problem with this idea is that it doesn’t do anything about mid-lane Soraka (though that might be more about changing Starcall).\n\nA less adventurous version of this mechanic would be wrap up some of the heal into 2(3?) extra heal procs on Soraka’s target from stacks of [Astral Payment] (both pre-existing stacks and those gained during the few seconds after the heal, up to the same cap) instead of the health-loss mechanic. This loses some of the satisfaction of the on-demand heal, and it would probably need to be tuned down more to prevent passive play (such that the heal would be too weak or too inefficient to sustain without empowering it through combat).
