Theres the account buying kind, where someone buys a high level account, and then theres the carried boosted, where someone plays together with a high leveled friend and gets carried to a high level. You can't ban someone for playing, and winning, ranked games and getting to plat or diamond themselves just because they happened to be playing with a friend.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sypther","date":"2016-10-15T01:50:26.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I made this post I was doing Very well in my gain to gold, that prick talking like its about rank in league when its me asking, \"Why is it that league allow's players to get boosted to gold/plat/ and so on, \" but that's all I did  and just wanted to know if or not they banned or why are so many overlooked when its obvious they were.\n\n\nBtw PuffyP all because im in silver doesn't mean im not as good or better than you at the game so i would be alittle nicer to ppl you dont know mate k cool.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Embertine","date":"2016-09-07T16:58:07.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Boosted players are banned when their account is flagged for inspection and it is determined that the player was boosted.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RcGjWO640w","date":"2016-09-07T16:40:44.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair, it's in the ToS that account sharing is bannable, so... yeah, it kind of already is?","replies":[]}]}
