I took a break from the game and wanted to play the game, the new client update was out 6 months ago so I saw it and started patching. When I was done and came in to the client and wanted to log in I was greeted with the same screen as when I was patching, there was no place to write your info just a picture of \"the new client is out\" PS: I know about the \"delete the LeagueClient.exe\" thing but the problem is that I do not have that file in my folder!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-03T01:31:02.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll need to wait for that client update to finish, but if it never properly starts then we may need to adjust a few things.
