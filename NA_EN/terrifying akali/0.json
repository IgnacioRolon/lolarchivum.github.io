Now I lost the end season rewards and can&#039;t even earn S chests because of honor 0 and inegibility of rewards. The thing is, I&#039;m here watching people that say even after 4 months without typing are still honor 0 without even getting chests. I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s better just to create a new account or give up the game entirely. I don&#039;t even mind a chat ban, but chests are important to me because of the rewards. And going from honor 3 to 0 is a bit rough.. And we have no timer or any way to check our progress to having rewards back.. doesn&#039;t that defeat the purpose? Idk.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2017-11-10T19:20:04.916+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"> The thing is, I'm here watching people that say even after 4 months without typing are still honor 0 without even getting chests.\n\nThey might be saying it, but it's not happening.
