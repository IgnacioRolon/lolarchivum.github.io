However, I can't make any use of the files I gain. Its great for reviewing vods and learning, but for content creation it seems limited.\r\n\r\n1. Is there a way I can physically download the entirety of my game with one click? Or do I have to record the entire thing manually? I've tried recording the game with 8x speed and... it produces an 8x speed video. \r\n2. I know can use an online converter, but is there a direct method that will allow me to download the file as .mp4 or any editable video format?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-17T20:37:24.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The replay system is still being fleshed out so there's still a few features that are being worked on.
