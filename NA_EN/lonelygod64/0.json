My next match though load in, have no connection problems, and then at the 2 minute mark I get disconnected and can't even log in to the client for hours on end. I'm getting really frustrated with this and really hope Riot can get their servers together, so I can actually enjoy the game again. \r\n\r\nReally hope this doesn't start giving me leaver penalties, that would really piss me off.","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-11-15T23:19:15.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I strongly recommend that you stay clear of matchmaking a game before we can figure out what's causing that.

When that happens, and you try to relog, do you get any error messages at all that might shed some light on what's preventing you from doing so?\n\nWhile we're at it, I also strongly recommend that you hit up our Troubleshooting guide for Connection issues [**over here**](http://riot.com/12B7oac).
