At higher Elo - You can trust your team. \r\nNot so in Silver.\r\n\r\n2. At higher Elo - If your plaT+ laner dies twice he (usually) puts the breaks on his aggresion and tries to stop the snowball - at the cost of cs&#039;ing under tower and maybe even giving up a tower.\r\nNot so in Silver. In Silver it isn&#039;t uncommon at all to come out of laning phase with a laner who went 0-7 and is STILL trying to 1v1 his lane opponent.\r\n\r\n3. At higher Elo - people understand the mid game mechanics and the importance of vision and ward control.\r\nNot so in Silver. It isn&#039;t uncommon for right after laning phase for a clown fiesta of deaths to appear and one character quickly gain 10+ &quot;gimmie&quot; kills immediately after laning phase.\r\n\r\n4. At higher Elo - Global objectives are prioritized.\r\nNot so in Silver. It isn&#039;t uncommon to see 5 people chase a kill over half a map and then run into respawns and wipe.\r\n\r\nAnyone care to prove me wrong? Playing in silver is like a completely new gamestyle. Clown Fiesta Style.\r\n\r\nProve me wrong. Take a look.","replies":[]}
