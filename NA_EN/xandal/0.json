I had every champion and the vast majority of runes with back-up IP and a ton of skins purchased. I moved to South Korea and playing on NA servers is just out of the question. I would love to play the game, but apparently it's impossible to transfer to KR. Why is that? Are there any other options besides leveling a brand new account?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-16T15:35:55.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That region is connected to another support, so we don't have the tools available to offer something like that.  Meaning that the two regions aren't connected so a transfer would be unlikely.  You'll have to hit up their [support team](http://%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%/Customer/qna_login.php) to see if they can offer any options for you.  Good luck!","replies":[]}]}
