It seems like it&#039;d be a special interaction with gragas but it&#039;s triggering in games without him and it triggers constantly. This voiceline will overlap other voice lines may be the only bug here, but it&#039;s sort of odd to hear 2 taliyah voices at the same time.","replies":[{"poster":"semipriceysoap","date":"2018-03-23T20:11:14.937+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there - thanks for bringing this up!
