Are two very different things.\n\nI mean, there isn't really even a \"right\" or \"wrong\" answer to this question anyway, but only because we play in teams of 5 champions, not 1. The objectively best option would be to pick champions with a 50% win rate 100% of the time, in the first few picks, then pick champions who have a higher chance to win based on the information which has been gained by seeing the first 5 champions. \n\nThere is a little bit more famous example in baseball, where you don't want a line up of 4 home run hitters. It's more advantageous to have 3 non-home run hitters (who more consistently get hits), and then the 4th batter be one who more consistently gets a home run, but less consistently gets a hit.","replies":[{"poster":"Wolfess","date":"2016-11-02T20:40:25.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=deadlychuck,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tbepU4v1,comment-id=000000000001000000000001,timestamp=2016-11-02T19:16:29.783+0000)\n> The objectively best option would be to pick champions with a 50% win rate 100% of the time, in the first few picks, then pick champions who have a higher chance to win based on the information which has been gained by seeing the first 5 champions. \n\n\nyou answered your own question, why are you here?","replies":[{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2016-11-04T03:35:20.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You say that like i was doing the poll to find out an answer...\n\nNo, i made this poll to see what other people thought, on the basis that most really fail to recognize the difference between the two.","replies":[{"poster":"Wolfess","date":"2016-11-04T17:48:39.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=deadlychuck,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tbepU4v1,comment-id=00000000000100000000000100000000,timestamp=2016-11-04T03:35:20.607+0000)\n>\n> You say that like i was doing the poll to find out an answer...\n> \n> No, i made this poll to see what other people thought, on the basis that most really fail to recognize the difference between the two.\n\nwouldn't matter because if someone was strong enough to bullshit people out of wins with just being able to have a guaranteed 50% win ratio and possibly more, then they'd probably get the instaban list often until the problem was found.","replies":[{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2016-11-04T19:35:25.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now, you seem to be ignoring the core concept and focusing on the numbers.
