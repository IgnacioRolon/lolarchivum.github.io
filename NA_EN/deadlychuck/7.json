No. It&#039;s undeniable that the assassin class, as it&#039;s designed and balanced today, came well into the game&#039;s design. In fact, many of these champions, particularly the older ones which have since been reworked, were originally considered some form of fighter and/or mage. \n\nI&#039;m sure there&#039;s other champions who share similar problems, but that&#039;s literally just the list you get when you filter by &quot;assassin&quot; on the wiki. Clearly this doesn&#039;t account for champions who can easily build as pure damage and play like an assassin.

Everyone had their specializations, but most still had to account for the rest of the game's mechanics when optimizing. Where as assassins were given an infinite \"skill ceiling\" for defense and then just left to optimize for damage. \n\nSince then classes like tank and marksmen have followed suit as riot forcibly polarizes classes into their niche. Not only homogenizing them, but removing the flexibility of the middle ground in the process.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Common Satyr","date":"2018-11-28T01:00:55.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"meh I think we are just in a meta stuck logic. If you had a team that took zac jungle and mao top and they built pure tank they would get and feel tanky. People are just told that the meta is pure damage so they do it and when it works they use confirmation bias to back it up. Tanks are fine. People just need to pick them.","replies":[{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2018-11-28T01:09:05.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You misunderstand. The reason that every non-tank builds pure damage, is because of these champions. Which means that while actual tanks who have been slowly given additional scaling with defensive stats over the years (the most recent I remember is amumu), scaling that they didn't previously need, building defense can still work. Where as non-tanks are forced into building pure damage without any actual defense because the assassins scale multiplicative with damage and the tanks scale multiplicative with defense. \n\nSo if you're a primarily damage class, then building any amount of dedicated tankiness makes you incapable of killing a tank and no better at surviving against an assassin.\nAnd conversely a primarily defensive class building some damage, will lose substantially more tankiness than they'd gain in building even a small amount of dedicated damage items.
