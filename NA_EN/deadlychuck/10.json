Most mages are pretty shit when it comes to anything outside of the singular build which makes them vaible. \n\nAlso stop acting like CDR is something which is actually prevalent to mages and AP champions, when AD champions have almost 50% more access to CDR (outside of support items) as AP champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2017-02-18T14:47:18.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The point is AP itemization is actually really strong and versatile despite what you want to claim, mages often build based on how it complements their kit and that's generally their build. \n\n{{champion:13}}  {{item:3027}}  {{item:3040}}  {{item:3158}} \n{{champion:112}}  {{item:3100}}  {{item:3020}} {{item:3157}} \n{{champion:35}}  {{item:3146}} {{item:1402}} {{item:3020}}\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PrinceOfStorms","date":"2017-02-18T08:58:45.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"MR is also really cheap and gold efficient, and there aren't that many MPen options that you can just build, unlike lethality.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2017-02-18T06:28:51.701+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"100-0ing anything in range.\n\nWhile you're ranged. \n\nAnd have utility.

Only for the ~10 minutes which comprise the mid game, does AP get an advantage.
