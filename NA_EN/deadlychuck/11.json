It's probably more or less the fact that AD's sacrifice less than AP's while also paying less for full CDR. Morellonomicon is 20% cdr Essence Reaver is 30% cdr. If mages want more cdr other than 20% we either gotta buy an AD item with CDR, or... Spirit Visage(MR and Health and with barely any spellvamp left in the game that 25% healing is pretty useless) The only other viable options were Iceborn but the AP got removed and not all mages make use of Spellblade, which it's better on AD people. Frozen Hearts which is 20% but is only good for reducing attack speed, Abyssal Scepter which is a full price tag as well as Morello and then you'd have to buy Zhonyas or Ionian boots or go AD.\n\nBuying something like Essence Reaver nets you a free 20% cdr on top of the items 10% by just building how you normally do. That's a stupid design decision. Black Cleaver is 20% and has a ton of useful benefits. Spirit Visage is perfect for everyone except APs cause of Lifesteal and helpful life regen. It's easier for an AD Champion to get 40% cdr than it is a mage and that really shouldn't be the case. Not to mention the removal of spellvamp was also a stupid decision as mages have no way to protect themselves from an AD rampant game, other than relying on protection that can no longer happen anymore. If a mage doesn't build any health, you're pretty much done.\n\nKha'Zix 1 Shots you, ADCs who build any MR will kill you. Rengar 1 Shots you. Juggernauts don't 1 shot you, but you don't really trade well half the time. The game is pretty unbalanced and needs a damage tone down.","replies":[{"poster":"dunder kill","date":"2017-02-10T03:32:09.671+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nobody cares about your opinionated BS.\n\n40% CDR is NOT hard on AP","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2017-02-10T01:09:09.611+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"hahahahahahahahahahaha\n\noh, you were serious?\n\nHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chaos Milk Tea","date":"2017-02-10T01:52:03.326+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"hm\nWell let's take an AP assassin and see what applicable cdr items there are\n{{champion:131}} will do.\n{{item:3152}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3115}} \noh man, her core items have so much cdr you can't fit it all","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheLastShadow45","date":"2017-02-10T01:19:58.859+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> AP struggles to get 40% \n\nSince the Mage update this is completely untrue.\n\nI also played the mode on the PBE and got 40% CDR no problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-02-10T01:10:41.998+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3165}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3152}} {{item:3100}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2017-02-10T01:08:34.136+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morello's+abyssal is 30% by themselves- with CDR runes that's already near-hitting the cap.","replies":[]}]}
