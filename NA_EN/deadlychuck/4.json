Although the question is about the fact that a **full team of physical damage is so commonly successful**. The massive over performance of pure AD vs pure AP comps clearly isn&#039;t balanced for a multitude of reasons, but why is it that despite having almost completely AD champions, they did almost 70% physical damage (as a team), and despite a team with a total of almost 700 bonus armor, fights rarely last more than about 10 seconds?\r\n\r\nI get that riot wants to have a fast exciting game, but at this point they&#039;ve sacrificed too much of the game&#039;s quality in that attempt. I&#039;m sorry, but the qualities of a good game, don&#039;t align to the qualities of good television. They&#039;ve really got to slow the game down some, because getting one use out of an ability before dying in a team fight despite having excessive resistance against almost all of the enemies damage **isn&#039;t** a good state for the game.","replies":[{"poster":"ScissorsNstuff","date":"2016-12-21T05:29:58.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"So because full AP wouldn't be successful then full AD can't be?

Why is it that AD is allowed to be disproportionately strong compared to AP, and have such a high success rate despite it's regular occurrence as the primary damage type of a team?\n\nEven in the case that the enemy team accounts for the damage type and build pure armor and has tanks, they still get rolled over with little effort.","replies":[{"poster":"ScissorsNstuff","date":"2016-12-21T05:41:52.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"why is a reason needed?\n\nBut looking at the chart it looks like you yourself had no AP champ of significance.

I don't care how fed the yi is, there is only so much power you can buy on a champion, and when that power is enough to go clean through their direct counter (in terms of items) then you've got fucked game balance. \n\nMind you this isn't saying that Yi is OP, every single one of them did this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Guyy Fieri","date":"2016-12-21T08:15:21.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just my opinion...but the whole AD-AP team comp thing really only helps make a difference in a close game.  With the gold lead the AD team had, it requires both teams to be full build to even out (which wasn't the case).  You could give that team five tanks or five carries or five anythings and that type of gold and they would win most every fight barring misplays.  That's just the nature of gold leads.\n\nNever mind the fact that Trist, Yasuo and Yi are three of the hardest scaling champs in the game so even when the gold lead does effectively even out, those three champs just do so much better with full build than most team comps.  \n\nFurther, Yi and Camille offer a decent of true damage, which offers a different kind of damage spectrum than physical damage which can avoid the armor stack.  I saw the thornmail on somebody which was the best combat it (at least for Yi).  Full AP comps can work if you snowball them hard enough (especially considering that there are less mr tank options then AD).  There Banshee's Veil and Spirit Visage for AP and Randuin's, Sunfire Cape and Deadman's Plate for AD.  Meaning tanks would have to combat it be building an item like Abyssal Septer or Maw of Maltorius (based on damage type) to get another worthwhile MR only game.  \n\nUltimately, it wasn't the fact they were all AD but it was the fact that they snowballed harder than your team did.  In the early game when tank stats really haven't been build, you can get away with it long enough to snowball.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HeresyHorus","date":"2016-12-21T07:05:05.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"first things first, league is a game that clearly favors AD champs .\n\nwhy ?\n\n1- AD champs can easily have Burst + DPS + Survivability with little to no pay-offs .\n2- Raneged auto-attacks nature .\n\nnow looking at your match :\n\nALL of your team ( and i mean ALL, even your tanks and supports ) should have had Ninja Tabi + _**PD**_ + ( HP/DMG item ) .\n\nthe remaining 3 items depends on each champ's type and role .","replies":[{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2016-12-21T07:50:07.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, league is clearly a game which favors AD champions.
