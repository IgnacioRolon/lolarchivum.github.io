With most items providing other forms of damage that they still benefit from. The only exception to this that I can think of are the {{item:3086}} items which ONLY provide secondary stats. And a full attack speed/crit marksmen is useless, you still need to build flat AD on them. \n\nBut let's lay it out this way, when {{item:3071}} {{item:3147}} or {{item:3031}} are strong, all of these classes can justify picking them up. When one of those are weak however, one of the classes feels a substantial hit to their ability to effectively fill their role, while the other classes still have their tailored items to fall back on, even if they're not able to use one of the powerful items designed for a different class. \n\nThen you have other items which are just made for all of them and none of them, {{item:3812}} provides the flat AD for everyone. CDR for the juggernauts and assassins. Lifesteal & spell vamp for the marksmen and juggernauts. Burst dampening for the assassins and marksmen. That's not to say that DD is OP, only to use it to demonstrate that in fact ALL of these classes absolutely can use the same itemization. As I said in my OP, they have no business to be doing so when they're also intended to act as counters to each other.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-11-25T04:07:32.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3812}} is one of those troublesome outlying items that needs a rework or removal.

Make it a pure duelist item and require them to get sustain from other sources to survive.","replies":[{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2018-11-25T04:25:35.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, but that has nothing to do with what I brought the item up to demonstrate. \n\nIt provides flat AD makes it a viable item across all 3 classes, even if not optimal.

For the longest time for example, Assassins straight up didn't have any real items for themselves. They stole crit and armor pen items from ADCs and Bruisers. Even now though, they have a total of 3 Lethality items. You can't even make a dedicated full build for them really. This is also the problem with Bruisers->Juggernauts and their sometimes abusive sometimes worthless relationship with Tank items. At the very least though Juggernauts nowadays do have enough items to make a full build with. \n\nIt's incredibly controversial to mention anything that sounds like \"We need more Lethality items in the game\", but the reality is with the problems you've pointed out, that's one very obvious and perhaps very necessary conclusion to take.","replies":[]}]}
