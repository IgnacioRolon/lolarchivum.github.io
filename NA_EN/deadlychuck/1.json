They were clearly not english players. I&#039;m just very confused, because my assumption from context would be that it means &quot;noob&quot;/&quot;scrub&quot; ... yet i was 9/5... against a darius... I was able to 2v1 multiple times against enemies. My guess would be that they were just salty for me making decisions they didn&#039;t understand or agree with, and were resorting to calling me names.","replies":[{"poster":"DoubleisAwesome","date":"2017-01-27T07:56:24.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a native Mandarin speaker, I am pretty sure boom is the sound that it makes when your mom explodes. People who game in China sometimes use insults like \"your family explodes\" or \"your mom explodes\".. By exploding, they mean crashing or blowing up, which sounds funny in Mandarin. Boom is just an easier way to express this I guess. So yes, \"mom boom\" is definitely an insult.","replies":[{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2017-01-27T08:06:04.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting.
