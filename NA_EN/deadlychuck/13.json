They've constantly pushed the power of the meta up, to the point where anything that isn't in the meta is almost impossible, and not building the most optimal way on champions means you are miles behind by build alone. \r\n\r\nSure, people will always crunch numbers and find the \"best\" way to build or do something, but that just means that the other options should be close enough to the \"best\" options that skill and knowledge can overcome that gap.

If you didnt see that insane winrate over the last week or 2 of her being released she was an absolute monster in soloque and still is. As for off meta builds, there are plenty of different build paths for different champions to make them viable in ranked play, sure ad carries are a little sparce but if you build a runaans on say jinx or kalista I feel like you're no less potent if you're positioning well and adapting your play style accordingly. No champion should have a golden standard as to being able to play more than one way there are far too many champions and way too much to balance to cater to you wanting to play a select few champions in as many different ways as you please while keeping the competitive scene in tact.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lDontLiftIcarry","date":"2015-01-19T12:35:43.909+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've moved on from alot of games in my time.\nLeague will soon be replaced by gigantic and black desert online when I get a better computer.\n\nIm done with this game after 5 years.\nI played alpha.\nI owned black alistar.\netc etc etc.\n\nI've seen it all when it comes to this game I was there.\nI experienced it and felt the changes.\nThe game was at its peak before ahri was released.\nand then everything after and including ahri was just the decent into madness for me personally.\nThe champion kits lacked depth and instead had alot of damage and things to do instead of that.\n\nchampions like jayce that have alot of stuff to do but require in reality very little skill to completely squash the enemy in lane simply because his stats were and still are so high.\n\nSpikers(people who play w/e's fotm.. this includes pros) Don't really care because they just want their elo or their wins or actually enjoy the broken champion kits.... w/e their reason.\nIts not my reason.\nI fell in love with a moba that had depth.\nI lost my love for a moba that sacrificed depth for ingenuity and complexity..\nThis game has become more often then not a chore for me to play now and I feel sad when I admit it.\n\nThe only reason I can't move on is I'm limited because of the people I support in real life and the lack of funds this allows me for \"me\" time.\nAt the end of every month I barely have 100 dollars to spend on anything I want.\nAnd thats assuming I don't have extra bills or something.\nThis money goes into the bank for those random accidents.\nAnd then is used up generally 2-3 times a year for doctor visits from sickness or car falling apart.. w/e...\nI don't get to just start over on a new game.\nI'm stuck with older games.\nGames I've loved since day 1 of their release.\nI'm not complaining.\n\nI'm just saying thats how it is for me.\n\nI've watched giants like runescape die.\nBroodwar come and go.\nGuild wars 1 have its time.\nI've seen the hype of games like firefall and what they promise.\nI've seen what activision did to CoD after CoD4\nI've seen the halo franchise be turned to ashe by releases like Destiny sundering the name of bungie and 304 destroying the story that made halo 1-3 so amazing to play.\n\nI've seen lots of things.\n\nBut riots is special in the fact that they can change.\nBefore they're truely run by some higher corporate hand.\nbut they won't\nThey change for the sake of change.\nAnd not for the sake of the community.\nAnd this will be their downfall in the end.\n\n-bows my head in silence-\nMay you truely see your mistakes before it is too late riot.\nmay you truely.\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"FatesDefiler","date":"2015-01-18T16:52:44.422+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It feels like the game, while releasing in many new territories and trying to gain new players, has been simplified to the point of almost every decision being binary.  Taking the balance between damage and resistance items into account, it seems like the game is purposely balanced to remove all thought from the item buying process and simply make it into 'whoever buys the most, biggest swords wins.'  maybe it was done intentionally, maybe not, but the game's in a worse condition than I've seen it since I started playing when the original ninja trio was released.  Since snowdown was removed, I don't play anymore than maybe a couple bot games a week.","replies":[]},{"poster":"prepare2bSPANKED","date":"2015-01-19T21:05:24.814+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As we speak riot is making itemization even more boring (R.I.P.

Started this game when Brand was released, (whenever that was) and apart from the limited edition game modes and team builder, the game has really fell off from what it used to be. Any more I get urges to play here and there, and for the most part I do have fun when I play, but the main reason I still play is out of a sense of obligation because I've invested so much time and money into this game.\n\nI enjoy games like *Dragons and Titans*, or *Infinite Crisis* because they are not so bogged down by the \"meta\" or the  \"pro scene\", but still return to this game only because I've invested so much into it. (That being said my buddy and I played a Leona/Blitz bottom lane last night and had a blast. Lost the game but only lost our lane when they 5 manned us bot. And no one ever bitched at us. It was a nice change of pace. Draven died many deaths.)\n\nBut yeah, this game is becoming more and more cookie cutter simplicity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PL55","date":"2015-01-18T12:53:44.772+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I first started playing, I loved this game because of how many things I could do and the people playing with me were learning too.
