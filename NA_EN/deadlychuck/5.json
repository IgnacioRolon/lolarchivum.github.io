Where as if an AD champion gets behind in a game, their damage isn&#039;t made nearly irrelevant, just less influential, yet they retain just as much of their mechanical influence as an AP champion. But in the case that neither is behind, then there isn't any kind of advantage to being AP, they're on par at best. Making AD lower risk equal reward!\nThe normal argument for why this is normally has to do with AP champions tending to get more CC, but all of that is made irrelevant when AD champions keep getting designed with more CC and general mobility creep, since virtually all AP CC is still being attached to skillshots. \n**\nDIVIDE THE ROLES OF THE PRIMARY STATS RIOT.

If {{champion:122}} now scales with AP on his Q, then that doesn't somehow make {{champion:115}} scale worse with the same build as before the change. It would make part of his kit weaker, but would give the player a decision on how to use his abilities, rather than them acting as both damage and utility, but not having to sacrifice his auto attacks like AP champions. \n\n2) Take the portion of AD that is overlapping with AP, and separate it into it's own new primary stat. \n- This one is obviously a bigger task, because it would require a pass over all the champions, new itemization, and (the hardest part) picking a new color. \n- Basically, if you had a stat like \"expertise\", which acted as a primary stat used directly for scaling purposes on \"**Skills**\", but not on \"**Abilities**\"... You might see where I'm going with this... Basically it would get it's own set of secondary stats and act as an intermediate between AD and AP. It might benefit from say lifesteal and CDR. It would also require either a new defensive stat or function as raw true damage. But from the opposite prospective it could act as mage's attack modifier scaling, with things like {{champion:4}} E, {{champion:61}} passive, {{champion:115}} passive, {{champion:112}} 2nd half of Q, {{champion:85}} W passive. Opening those up to benefit from lifesteal, and in some cases letting the CDR (like with ziggs or viktor) act as a means to increase the frequency of them triggering.\n\nHowever, it wouldn't have the implicit auto attack scaling of AD. \nThink of it like three different pie charts. \nCurrently, you have AD overflowing into AP, taking up 2/3 of the primary stat pie chart. \nThen the two options break down into receeding the AD back to only occupy 1/3 of the pie chart or adding in a new field which reduces each primary stat to being only 1/4 of the whole pie chart.\n\nIt would become the preferred damage stat for champions like {{champion:238}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:92}} who are basically just treating AD as ability power.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-11-05T03:27:08.769+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">  How you came to the conclusion that simply swapping the scaling of these champions from AD to AP would somehow impact the AP champions is baffling.\n\nI never suggested that, but it actually would. Mess up AD balance and you mess up everything indirectly. It would make AP champs more (relatively) powerful, not less.\n\nChanging AD scaling into AP would require a huge change to itemization and a couple seasons of balancing to fix all the fallout. In the end, things would end up back more or less where they are now.","replies":[{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2018-11-05T03:34:20.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They literally did the opposite of this in the past. So it's not beyond their capacity to do it in a correcting manner. Yes, it would require a couple of seasons of rebalancing and reitemizing if it was all done at once, but the way they managed to justify it before was to stretch it out over 4 seasons and slowly roll out the changes. \n\nPresumably if they were to implement this, then you'd see the same general approach. \n\n> Option B: Replace them with AP\n>\n> Result B: Every champ with AP ratios is now unplayable trash, except for Corki and Ez, who are now mages.\n\nHowever, currently most champions who use AD as AP actually beat mages and/or marksmen and tanks. So really this would just be bringing them to an even playing field in their mage and/or marksmen matchups, but allowing them to still beat tanks.\nUnless you don't think that AP is strong enough to beat marksmen or mages. Like for example, Zed wouldn't be suddenly shut out going against a mage if his Q and E scaled with AP. He'd still keep his burst damage and mobility that he uses to overwhelm them if he builds AP. But by building AD, would then be pretty much just as capable in the tank matchup as he is now (even though Zed vs Tank isn't exactly preferable now either, it's not the worst matchup in the world).

It's the hardest and least sure why of fixing balance that I've heard in ages. It would cause many more issues than fix and it would honestly be pretty unfun.

But I assure you, it might not be the easiest way to fix the balance issues, but it's absolute one of the most reliable ways. \n\nSecond, \n\n> Mages in general are doing just fine by winrate.\n\nYes, mages are at a relatively high win rate, but win rate isn't representative of viability. The thing that tends to set specifically mages apart is their high magic damage. This prevents secondary defense stacking of armor or MR, creating openings for your AD champions to kill the tankier targets or punish them with the magic damage. In a match up of viability, AD overwhelmingly wins out.

Let's assume a couple of these premises to be true. The game is heavily lopsided towards AD and the natural order of the stat design is not the way that the game is currently being maintained, and my suggestion would create chaos for the sake of it. Then shaking up the proverbial sandbox which is lopsided in favor of AD right now to create chaos, would statistically be more likely to be balanced. Is it a surefire way to make things balanced? No, I don't think any honest single suggestion could claim that. \n\nFourth,\n\nI will admit, that I'm in favor of conversion to AP rather than simply lowering AD, because this would give the AD caster style champions a choice in how they want to play the champion, as opposed to limiting their AD scaling and simply forcing them into a particular play style with the champion. Mind you this doesn't mean changing the damage types, only scaling stats. \nBut unfortunately, riot's history suggests that they'd prefer to simply lower the AD as it's easier for them to control for meta data purposes.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Bears Dont Care","date":"2018-11-05T03:44:34.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=deadlychuck,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=53W6rUOE,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2018-11-05T01:22:50.272+0000)\n>\n> I never said AD ratios were a new phenomenon.\n> \n> They have existed for all of league.\n\nEh...\nOriginally  AD affectes only auto attack damage and AP affected abilites, hence the names.\nOP might be rethinking stuff from long ago.","replies":[{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2018-11-05T03:49:29.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, that's literally what I'm saying to do...
