Just about anything is viable in blinds, far more than draft.","replies":[{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2016-12-01T14:34:00.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm never said blind didn't allow for more options, but as far as viability is concerned. You can't go into a game with the same information you would in draft, and that means you will often, in effect, lose from the load screen. Riot keeps balancing for the ranked gameplay, which is why it's acceptable to have these extremely powerful general purpose champions who really only consistently lose to very specialized champions.","replies":[]}]}]}
