Have fun with that.\n\nNo, that's not in any what what i'm saying. I'm upset that in terms of all archetypes, AD champions are a subset of each, but AP champions aren't. Basically, every role on the team can be accomplished by an AD champion, but it can't be done by an AP champions. Then to add onto that, AD/Armor design very much favors the AD, where AP/MR favors MR. Hell look at how many champions have built in armor pen vs built in magic pen; alternatively at how many champions have AD scaling magic damage vs AP scaling physical damage. How about the keystones instead?\n\nArmor Pen/Shred: {{champion:59}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:157}} \n\nMagic Shred: {{champion:96}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:32}} \nTurns out all built in magic pen, is actually shred.\n\n> Also- do tell me where these AD champions are that have &quot;mage kits&quot;?

Sure there are AD champions that rarely fit one of these- but none of them are truly team-players like Mages are.\n\nI guess that depends what you define as a mage. Mages really aren't team players, by design, they're ranged AoE dps. Yeah, most of them have some form of CC, but it's all complementary and no more than that of AD champions in most cases. They're designed to be most effective in team fights, but they aren't designed to be team players, what you're thinking of is SUPPORTS.\n\nBut in order of what you said... excluding shields/heals for allies, which most AP champions don't actually have, hints why {{item:3174}} isn't ever used.\nSilence:{{champion:86}} Snare:{{champion:107}} Ranged Stun:{{champion:67}} Ranged Root:{{champion:202}} Untargetable:{{champion:240}} SelfRez:{{champion:266}} Fear:{{champion:56}} Poke:{{champion:126}} Zoing:{{champion:420}} \n\n\n> The fact that you just said one type of team is viable and the other is not while mentioning in the same sentence how the other can still win makes me think this conversation is going to have a problem as well.
