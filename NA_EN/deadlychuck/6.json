It's not ok for a Syndra to kill a carry just with ult. I understand that by nerfing everyone's damage, champions that rely on burst the most are hit the most, and sustain monsters thrive. If riot actually were to do this, which I seriously doubt they would, they'd need to make a balance \"pass\" to compensate for these and more factors. For starters, burst reliant champions should generally be nerfed less. Secondly, utility buffs could help phase out some of the burden of not being able to 1 shot carries anymore. Or small kit changes to make it so even though you are fully burst focused, there's more skill and counterplay to it.\n\nRegardless, sustain would have to be hit too, so if you're a burst mage in this hypothetical new league and you burst the enemy adc from 100 to 20, he's not just going to recover all his health in 3 basics, and so he'll be in big danger if he wants to continue fighting, but at least the choice is there. This means burst isn't useless against adcs if it fails to kill. Ofc sustain shouldn't be gutted, though. Opting for a more lifesteal focused build should be an option, just not one that dominates the others and instead is a meaningful choice you have to make.\n\nIn this ideal League of mine, adcs wouldn't be so opressive that you'd have to 1 shot them at the start of the fight to have a chance, and so assassins would generally still function mostly the same except instead of going in when the target is full hp they'd go in after the target has been damaged enough if they want to instaburst, or if the target is out of position and/or the rest of the enemy team is busy, they'd go in earlier and they wouldn't have the problem of the adc being left at 10% hp and them being 2 shot while the adc recovers half his health.\n\nTo finish off, I think it'd be cool to have slowly ramping damage items/abilities for champions that want more dps at the cost of burst. Sort of like the concept with guinsoo's rageblade but different, and an actual item that more than a couple of champions would want to build.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Faceroll Tactics","date":"2017-08-18T12:23:38.923+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Have to be more precise than that.\n\nTanks are stupid, primarily maokai, sejuani, and cho.

However, it's not like there isn't strategic thinking to it. It's more like as if you're playing starcraft and your macro is terrible so no matter the strategy you come up with you're still going to lose, and deserve to lose.\n\nFor example, you don't need great reaction time if your damage foresight, positioning and understanding of zones and jungler influence are great. Instead of having to react to things you can already know when they're coming out if you understand how your enemy thinks, or not get in the situation if you don't.

The better you are at micro, the more damage you can pull off in a combo, the higher the chances you can dodge skillshots reactively and overall, get a better result in a particular skirmish/objective/siege/lane trade. \n\nMacro play would be reading the enemy cooldowns, enemy jungler location, the enemy mid laner location, my laner's ward locations and timer, and as a Shen thing, possible interventions with R, and after considering all of these, choosing the best course of action. This could be picking a good fight, going for an objective or even retreating.\n\nHowever, neither of these will work without each other. You can be a Vayne mechanics god but if you don't read the map and get caught out, no amount of micro is going to get you out of the cc and nukes of 5 enemies surrounding you. This is how some scripters still end up feeding. But yet, if you know all the ins and outs of the map, and you pick a good fight to engage in... if you can't kite for shit, the diver is going to kill you. The Kog maw video by Rubick is a different story, I for one cannot even comprehend how that it is even possible for an ADC to facetank. I have never seen something like that in my low level of play.
