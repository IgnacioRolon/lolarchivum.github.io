Its clear that my account has been hacked - whoever did it has spent $200 off of my debit card on RP. I've submitted a ticket just a little bit ago, but I'm hoping I don't have to sit and wait 2 days for a response. I don't carry cash, this is the only card I have and i'd prefer not to have to freeze it.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-22T03:54:05.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't give you an expected wait time, since response times will depend on how many tickets were submitted recently and where your ticket is in that queue. Our ticket specialists answer tickets on a first-come-first-served basis, so you'll have to wait for your ticket to reach a specialist.\n\nIf you have any other questions, let me know.","replies":[]}]}
