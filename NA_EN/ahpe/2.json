So she has to be capable of dodging multiple attacks while systematically eliminating each threat. \n\nWarwick on the other hand, is more the type to just dive right into the middle of the fray and tear people apart while tanking all their attacks. Hell, you can even see this in their gameplay. Warwick heals a lot and has an ability to reduce in coming damage so he can dive into enemy lines and tear them apart.

If Camille is superior in both brutal force and strategy, what makes Warwick unique and not completely garbage? \n\nYou guys really hard try to make Warwick completely trash in every single domain.

This is essentially a conflict between a precise and highly mobile individual used to out-thinking her opponents and a brute with feral cunning and raw strength on its side but a tendency to fall into a blind frenzy when the red mist descends. Failing any unfortunate accidents, one would have to presume that Camille could use her speed and easy access to vertical space to outmaneuver Warwick while landing attacks of opportunity until exhaustion, frustration or overwhelming bloodlust forced him to make a fatal error. She has no need to meet him in a head-on confrontation that isn't taking place on her terms and her altered physiology presumably means that she's more than capable waiting while out of his reach for extended periods of time. \n\nPutting this on Warwick's turf might hand him something of an advantage, but then that really brings things back to my first point: Camille isn't going to fight someone unless she is the one in control and she's absolutely going to push that edge right to the hilt. The only real chance I can see Warwick having would either be thanks to a freak accident or Camille's sense of superiority leading her to under-estimate him and gift him an opening.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahpe","date":"2018-08-17T14:46:15.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First the whole point of the post is who would win in a fight in the streets of Zaun and Camille has been put in many unfavourable situations and still fought and come out on top.\n\nAlthough Zaun is Warwick's turf who says Camille has no knowledge of Zaun?

Warwick is simply too simplistic; once you understand his behavior he's basically a wolf with no pack.\n\nOTOH, If Warwick finds Camille first, then Camille has no time to plan and Warwick will tear her to shreds; lore-wise she's an assassin, not a frontline warrior. Now, Camille fans may argue (with justification) that Camille is an assassin and knows how to keep hidden. And she does; from PEOPLE and HEXTECH.
