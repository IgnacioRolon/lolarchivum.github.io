Don't get me wrong, good stories need to have ties and connections when you're talking about scopes this large. But if you tie too many ends together, the world gets a little too perfectly explained, and for a fantasy setting, if you have perfect explanations for everything, you lose a good chunk of the unknown and mythical nature of storytelling that keeps it compelling. Mystery and the unknown keep stories going, because it always leaves room for a what if.\nMy other concern with the storytelling is that it's gravitating towards the dark side quite a bit too much. Darkness is good, it's a good element to any story, to make the good seem better and the grays more neutral. However, when almost all of the characters have grim-dark pasts or particularly violent or homicidal tendencies, even if they're supposed to be lighter, do-gooder characters, that starts to erode away at the overall diversity of the story telling, and it makes the world start to feel a little monotonous. They've done well trying to paint gray everywhere in the story, and there are plenty of villains and dark elements - but the opposite side, the good, is rather scarce, and without the good to contrast the bad, you kind of lose a bit of focus. I'd like to see more light and good side things happen, and more stories be told in that vein. I think Ornn's fairy tales were a prime example of what the lore needs more of, just pure light hearted stories - but I feel like his lore, where Volibear's people just kind of senselessly murder his followers, felt a bit forced and unnecessary, and just blotted Ornn with a really ugly dark spot to what should have been someone who's overall jolly. This kind of trend is a bit worrisome, as it happened with Ivern too, and I'd like to see them gear away from that kind of \"NEEDS MORE HORRIBLENESS\" to characters who are on a more mythic, jollier level than most of the champions in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-08-02T19:12:20.320+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is actually a great point, and something we always try to bear in mind.
