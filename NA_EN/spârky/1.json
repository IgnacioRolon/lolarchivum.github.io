So I really try my hardest to not afk in games but the past week has been a rough one. My computer kept crashing and freezing whenenver I got into games and i figured out why it was spotify crashing my computer but I was the reason for a remake and I got a 5 min ban instantly for dc'ing once in the past month or so. I was annoyed but thats fine. Then my computer crashed again this was when I had no idea what was crashing my computer this was 10 days after my previous 'afk'/ remake and I got a 10 minute ban. I was more annoyed now but thats fine. But then It happened again today (when i finally figured out what the problem was) and I got a 20 minute ban (Im assuming it was because I 'afk' while playing out my 10 minute bans. I'm not asking to get rid of the leaverbuster frankly i deserve it. But I was just curious because 3 games of me afk'ing resulted in a 20 minute ban. Am I just missing something or does 3 remakes really put me on a 20 minute ban. \r\nThanks for the clarification I just want to improve myself so this doesn't happen again ;D","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-10T03:02:53.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not actually seeing any punishments on this account right now, you might have already played through them, but it mostly depends on the how many games are being left and how many reports you're getting. If you afk while in an [**LPQ**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714#h2q2), it can definitely escalate the amount of time you have to wait since you would have left another game.","replies":[{"poster":"Spârky","date":"2017-07-10T13:08:37.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I grinded through the games. Ok thanks for the insight though I was just curious because on my match history I had 3 games where my computer crashed and I afk'd at the start. So that helps shed some light on how the leaverbuster system works and it will help me become a better summoner thanks for your time and help!","replies":[]}]}]}
