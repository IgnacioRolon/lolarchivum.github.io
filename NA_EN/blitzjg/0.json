Since the only way to actually use dual screens while playing most games including LoL is to have them in windowed mode I did so.  The problem is I cant get it to fit the appropriate size.  The monitor I am gaming on has its default rez to 1920x1080.  Which LoL displays fine in full screen, but if I switch it to Windowed, the game adds the normal borders you would expect, except they are slightly outside of the screen's resolution on top and bottom.  This is not an option because I can't move the camera downward in game since I can't move my mouse to the bottom of the game screen.  If I move it to the next size down which is like 1600x1040 or something it is much smaller than my screen and really defeats the purpose of having two monitors if I can see half of my main monitor while playing the game.  I also am unable to adjust the size of the window myself which would solve my problem but the windowed bar is basically uncooperative.  \r\n\r\nAlso I should mention the Borderless option has the same problems as switching to windowed.  Is there anything else I can do to have this fit properly?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-17T02:21:34.556+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While in windowed mode, you may be able to resolve this by holding down the Windows key on your keyboard and then press the up arrow on your keyboard.
