Any champion without insane burst AND super long CC can't really 1v1 him, because he will just put himself back to full fuckin hp. There is LITERALLY NOTHING you can do about his ult. Someone give me an ult that isn't a form change that doesn't have some counterplay. Anyone? No, his ult is the only thing in the game that can't have anything done about it.","replies":[]}
