This kept Rengar away from team fights, as he kept hunting me down and using all his summoners, ults and item actives to kill me. I got 2 inhibitors and almost a tower. \n\nEntire team starts flaming me about \"trolling\" and \"feeding on purpose\" though I SAID that I built that way to push, and POINTED OUT the fact that I got 2 inhibs.\n\nI went on tilt thx to the team harassing me.","replies":[]}
