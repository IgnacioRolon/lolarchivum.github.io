The Kat's movement will change in a VERY obvious way when she starts to look for an opening. She'll start to strafe up and down the lane instead of left and right when farming. She'll use qw to farm less. Just stay out of Kat's e range (everyone should know it by now) all the time and you should be good. And for the love of God, if you're not tanky, go back to base when you have half health or less. Kat *WILL* flash to get you.","replies":[]}
