I am currently in a game where:\r\nThe team kills are 29/59\r\nThe downed turrets are 1/8\r\nAnd we have an AFK\r\n\r\nBut since the Ashe and Morg saw \"nervur surrundur\" being supported by Riot, they decided to vote no.\r\nThese are norms, btw. \r\n\r\nAnd as I'm writing this, the game ended. Lasted 15 minutes more than it should have.","replies":[]}
