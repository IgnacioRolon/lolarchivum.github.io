Build full AP and instakill people\n\nAt gold people start to \"git gud\" and have map awareness, and buy Banshee's for Kat, ward common Kat ambush spots and such.\nSo I had to adapt to their adapting, had to watch the map 24/7 like a *good little mid laner*, which I had been able to do previously. Doing well and hating every second of it because I had to go all tryhard and shit. \n\nGuys, how do I get back to bronze?\n\nEdit: Can't post on smurf cuz forum still thinks it's 13 lol","replies":[]}
