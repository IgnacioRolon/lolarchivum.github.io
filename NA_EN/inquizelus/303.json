Pretty much mained him (Season 3). He was pretty fun.\n\n{{champion:245}} Played him when he was free, not since the post-release nerfs, though. He was pretty fun, too.\n\n{{champion:121}} Mained in Season 2, had an 86% win rate... Not as hilariously fun since nerfs, but still okay.\n\n{{champion:107}} Secondary main in Season 2. Win rate almost as high as Kha&#039;s. Not as hilariously fun since nerfs, but still okay.\n\n{{champion:157}} Mained him in Season 4. Not sure where he&#039;s at right now. Was super fun.\n\n\n(Yes I&#039;m a filthy assassin main. Don&#039;t judge. I enjoy the fast pace)","replies":[]}
