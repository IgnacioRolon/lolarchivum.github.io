I was {{champion:59}} jungle, and ganked top as soon as I finished blue. Shyvanna had allowed Kha to push to tower SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS REASON (she was winning in CS and they were both pretty much full health). She followed up on the gank perfectly, and I got her first blood after tanking the tower for a bit. Kha is pretty slippery. No flashes consumed (other than Kha's). \r\n\r\nI proceed down to middle lane, when I'm jumped by a wild Udyr! I'm half health from the dive up top, and Riven IMMEDIATELY breaks off from her minion lane and comes to kill Udyr. I gank mid and get her a kill on Swain(?).\r\n\r\nI ping bot that I'm on my way, and they allow their lane to push. Perfect follow-up, and Jinx(?) gets a double.\r\n\r\nThe ENTIRE MATCH went this way, and the team kills were 31-9 by the time the enemies surrendered.","replies":[]}
