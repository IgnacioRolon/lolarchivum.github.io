I ask Sejuani to gank at a low level to get me started, and she just AFK farms the jungle, despite her strong early ganks. I'm having a hard time with Lee and ask in chat for help (\"Hey I really need help up here\" *ping*) and she goes to get Dragon (*From our blue buff,* and we're blue side). I start *spamming* pings and she still does absolutely nothing.\n\nAfter repeatedly stating in chat that top is going to be lost and Lee will get fed, the tower goes down, and Sej still hasn't done anything.\n\nI wasn't being rude, either (well, until I realized Sej was ignoring me).
