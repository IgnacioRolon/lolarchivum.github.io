This is why going by volume of reports doesn't work. Chat restricting someone when they \"troll\" is like forbidding a shoplifter from being within a mile of an elementary school. The punishment doesn't fit the crime, not at all.\n\nNot sayin' I didn't deserve to be reported, though. Just sayin' I got reported for the *wrong thing* a lot, so got punished for the *wrong thing*.","replies":[]}
