I decided to play Shaco after the new jungle came out, and had an idea. What if I used my boxes on the buffs, and got golems/Gromp leashed? \r\n\r\nSo I put my boxes in such a way that, when the buff goes to attack the first box, the second box would activate, and so on. I explain this to my skeptical teammates (who know that Shaco doesn't normally need a leash) after I ask them to leash Gromp. After killing wolves at 2:30 (around 3:10 if starting golems), I'm a level 3 Shaco and ready to gank. \r\n\r\nSpread this strat around! It makes Shaco jungle a helluva lot easier *and* more efficient!","replies":[]}
