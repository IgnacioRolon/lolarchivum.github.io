People say that a person being a helicopter is impossible, and that I'm mentally ill. But I don't care. I'M BEAUTIFUL. I'm having a plastic surgeon install rotary blades, 30mm cannons, and AGM-114 Hellfire missiles on my body. From now on, I want you guys to call me Apache, in respect to kill from above, and kill needlessly. If you can't accept me, you're Helophobe, and you need to check your vehicle privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.","replies":[]}
