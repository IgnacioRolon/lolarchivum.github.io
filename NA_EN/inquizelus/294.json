I got a leash on these, and had started boxing red at 0:55.. I chained the boxes in such a way that, when red went to attack the first box, the second box would activate, and so on. I got my Gift of Heavy Hands and proceeded to red. I then got wolves, used smite on Gromp, and took blue. Zed was pushed up mid, so I got a kill on him. I proceeded up top and almost killed Shen. I went back, bought Pickaxe and Longsword, then ganked bot. \n\nI had high CDR, so I didn't have to worry much about dying. I didn't buy anything tanky, because I didn't need to. \nMy build order was:\n{{item:1039}} ->{{item:3077}} ->{{item:3713}}-> {{item:3086}} ->{{item:3117}}-> {{item:3087}} ->{{item:3134}} ->{{item:3074}} ->{{item:3142}} \nSOLD {{item:3713}} \nBOUGHT {{item:3714}} \nSTARTED {{item:3078}} but could only build {{item:3057}} before match ended\n\nWhat I'm *really* proud of, though, is the fact that I managed to delete every single Zed mark, dodge every single Braum ult, and juke the heck out of the enemies while at 10% HP.\n\nI'm usually around Bronze-Silver skill level (Gold V-IV in jungle), but I feel that I played almost as well as a Diamond this one match.\n\n(It was team builder, but still ..)","replies":[]}
