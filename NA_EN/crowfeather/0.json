By allowing queues of 4-5 people to be matched up against solo players, there seems to be no logical reason to play solo in ranked anymore. Unfortunately, I&#039;m one of those weirdos who actually enjoys playing alone. I didn&#039;t want to slam Riot right away for screwing over solo players, so I went to look for their rationale, which is where i found this gem:\n\n&quot;With the new Champ Select experience, we&#039;re giving players more benefits than ever before to play with friends because *we believe playing with friends is the right way to enjoy League*--we don&#039;t want the game to become an anti-social experience.&quot;\n\nOh. Oh sorry Riot, didn&#039;t realize that I was empirically playing your game wrong by preferring to play by myself.
