The reason why I think that this build has hyper-carry potential is that if you get even slightly ahead of your opponent laner, your late game with her can do 1v3&#039;s or even up to 1v5&#039;s if you know her well and play her kit to the full potential it can go. I wouldn&#039;t go as far to call myself an Illaoi master, but seriously try this build out if you are also an Illaoi fan and I can guarantee you a really good hyper-carry to climb the ladders with!!\nRegards,\nCrazyWolf.","replies":[{"poster":"Kaioko","date":"2016-01-26T20:21:43.777+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why on earth do you build a btrk on Illaoi?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-01-26T20:20:46.313+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No. Even by Silver players know how to dodge her Q and E and back off during her R.

She is definitely a good hyper-carry, and yeah Illaoi isn't really the best when the enemy team knows her kit quite well, but I still think that if you hold on to your ult for a teamfight and lock the enemy team down in a narrow jungle passageway, or the Baron pit then she will truly be a terror.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nagoh Shan","date":"2016-01-26T20:27:54.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not really. \n\nShe's a multiplicative scaling bruiser that's zone reliant. She doesn't have enough impact on her own success however to really carry hard. In lower divisions, where people make the mistakes needed to succeed as Illaoi, she's terrifying, but her winrate shows that people have learned that tentacles hurt and that they should stay out of her zones. When they do that her scaling is dramatically reduced, and she's surpassed by other options.\n\nShe needs people to actively refuse to kite, which makes her less than optimal vs other champs with similar damage output but higher reliability such as Fiora, Darius, or Kayle (Who's is about to explode I think she's absolutely nuts again for some reason).","replies":[]},{"poster":"XCrazyWolfX","date":"2016-01-26T20:24:38.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since she has next to no catch up abilities, except for flash and a low range on her w, the botrk has potential to help her catch up or even run away from her enemies.","replies":[]}]}
