During my first game of the 4.19 patch, I tought the Wall's bug was fixed (even though I used to only rarely encounter glitch with this champion, I was happy that you tryed to fix it) the thing is that now, his ult is even more laggy then it used to be.\n\nXin dash can go through my ult and I don't know if its because he's too eavy or something but my ult also go through volybear without touching him like if he was wearing a banshee (He wasn't wearing a banshee, I looked up). \n\nI can't explain in more detail how the lag occured, because its really simple, azir wall only push back anymore 1 time out of 3 or 4. \n\nRiot please fix this ! Thank you !\n\n\nEDIT : \nI just played a new game with the emperor and I now know that {{champion:4}}  can't be touched by my ult. I don't know if it can help you fix the lag (Maybe this is some failure in the coding about some champion, I'm just guessing , the rest is up to you riot)","replies":[{"poster":"CrashSender","date":"2014-11-05T20:43:18.815+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played Azir almost every game since he was released and there is couple of bugs he has. Before this new patch minor bugs were:\n1. When he dashes to his soldiers and enemy champion is on the way, sometimes (rarely) he would go through enemy (enemy didn't have Banshee or something like that).\n2. If you enable to see range while quick cast spells, when you press and hold Q, you would see range-line for 1 or 2 sec after solider is gone.\n3. If spell is on cooldown, I wouldn't show it that it is. It would look like his spell is ready again, but it's not.\nEverything else work fine for me. And now, after this new patch (4.19), is ult is very bugged. Almost every time at least 1 can go through my ult and that makes hit ult almost useless. Please fix this as soon as possible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"aikae","date":"2014-11-05T17:45:29.287+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am also having a problem with his ult. almost all of the ults I used last game did no damage and didn't have the knockback, enemies were also able to walk through the wall.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Toshihik0","date":"2014-11-06T03:58:49.280+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah he is definetly more bugged this patch.

And yeah, played a game, out of 10 ults 8 didn't do anything.

You will use a cool down, and on the summoners screen it appears to still be up, but is in fact on CD. It is quite frustrating to try and set up for a q, to only realize its still down.\n\nHe also has a lagging issue with his auto attacks and soldiers. Lots of times after they charge, or are just summoned, they have a problem making the first attack. The animation will go through all the way, or mostly, but no damage will be done to the minion. Sometimes he will do the studder animation, and the damage will actually go through. \n\nIt seems to me, that when a soldier is moved, summoned, or takes a break from attacking, then attacks, his soldiers basic attacks have a chance of not hitting, or a lagging animation that doesn't hit. It doesn't sound like this was addressed in the patch, that had quite a vague update on Azir.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wehrmacht Bunny","date":"2014-11-06T07:02:24.869+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> were his skills ...laggy... to you? last game I was having to press a button 2-4 times before a skill would trigger.
