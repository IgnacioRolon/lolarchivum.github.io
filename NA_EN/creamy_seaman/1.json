He can power farm really fast compared to most junglers and with the introduction to him in the top lane with smite its usually the first item they rush with a few opting to finish a Bork first then finishing it. For most WW players its the sustain that they are focusing on and not the MS. WW doesn't need it all that much once he hits 6. Since it doesn't matter if you see him coming or not because when he ults he has you locked down. \n\nAlso its not just him having it at lvl 6 exactly, but that with 1 point in his ult with devourer (lvls 6-10) is actually really strong. I recently played a game as ryze against one and while I had the early game. His healing out scaled my damage in the mid-late game. He would just ult me and get 1 combo off and I'd be down to half health and forced to either back or if my ult was up spam it so I could heal up. \n\nThe smite advantage that he gets can't be ignored either. He smites you and does extra true damage which is then free with his ult. So you are actually taking even more damage because of the smite and then he heals instantly and can typically walk out or chase you down very easily. \n\nOfc this is still early and it is without a doubt very strong and I lean to say that he needs a nerf atm, but it could just be the knee jerk reaction and more about not knowing the counter play.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Skias","date":"2014-11-24T18:41:13.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didnt realize you surpassed normal human reflexes to have hairtrigger item usage.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jivira","date":"2014-11-23T16:19:02.459+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":3,"body":"If every carry has to buy a qss just because the enemy team has a single champ, then there is a problem with balance.
