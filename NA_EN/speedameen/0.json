All will know us... in time.\r\n\r\n-What do all stories have in common, dear wolf?\r\n-They end.\r\n\r\n-Lamb, tell me a story.\r\n-There was once a pale man with dark hair, who was very lonely.\r\n-Why was it lonely?\r\n-All things must meet this man, so... they shunned him.\r\n-Did he... chase them all?\r\n-He took and axe and split himself in two.

Every time I pick them back up after a hiatus (I used to be a Kindred main, currently I've diversified champions pretty heavily) I feel like I'm having an experience rather than playing a MOBA. The voice lines, the animations, the sounds, the gameplay, it all works so well.\n\n I know lots of people only think of Kindred on the boards when they're calling for reworks but imo the character is superb as is. If the gameplay is boring to you that's your opinion but they serve a niche role in game and in lore. In lore they're basically a force of nature yet each half has their own personality and reasons for doing what they do. In game you play as Lamb, who is clearly the brains of the operation while still directing the emotional Wolf when it's okay to strike just like in the lore. You hunt people whose time it is to die as a marksman jungle with an ult that stops all from dying, it's amazing. \n\nThere's a few other characters that really grip me the same way but Kindred was probably the first. This post gets a big ol' thumbs up of appreciation from me.","replies":[{"poster":"Kazekiba","date":"2019-03-31T05:02:56.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Naalith,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=2hY9elOg,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2019-03-27T17:25:31.535+0000)\n>\n> \n\nThe reason people want a minor GPU on Kindred isn't boring kits or anything. It's how little action Wolf actually gets. The basic idea as I saw it was\n-- Lamb chooses targets, and seeks them out. \n-- Wolf chases and consumes any he can \n- Lamb leaps, and shoots at a group of targets (Q)\n- Wolf bites anything that comes close (W) \n- Wolf maims a target, and then severs their life (E) \n- Lamb chooses your time of death, and will not take you too early. (R) \n\nEach piece of Kindred takes half the kit. \n\nHOWEVER, the problem is that Wolf does not feel like an individual in anything besides arguably W. \nHis passive marks don't feel like Wolf is actively choosing them, only the flavor text. \nWolf is a small asset in Kindred's models and animations. \nThe two \"Wolf\" abilities still depend on Lamb - Attacking what Lamb last hit, or biting after Lamb has set them up.\nAnd then R is just ... Honestly, if they do give Kindred a full gameplay update with new animations et all, this needs to go. I know why they included it, but it's difficult to balance a champion for low elo (>80% of the player base, mind you) and a handful of pro teams when you have an AoE Tryndamere ult and it's not the most intuitive ability either.  (I love the idea of it being a \"tower dive for free\" button, but I don't know how often its used this way when most players can either Stopwatch or just bounce tower aggro anyway.)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2019-03-27T15:39:05.137+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lamb is blind while wolf is deaf?\n\nI agree that this whole yin and yang theme they have is lovely, but this detail can't be right, can it?\n\n____________________\n\nWhen it comes to moving and heartwarming characters, then Orianna is a big one for me.\nThis girl sacrificed everything, and I mean literally _everything_, to help people.
