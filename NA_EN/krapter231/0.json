These things hit me hard. I&#039;ve probably filed 100+ reports, and have never seen anybody get punished for it. I was wondering if I could send a support ticket about this to help punish this player, as I have screenshots of post game chat but not during game chat where he said kill yourself, etc. I have post game chat where he told me to uninstall. If you could, could you tell me how to file it and what format to follow? If somebody could tell me how to put images in posts, I would add it in. Thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Blue Jeans","date":"2017-07-26T13:40:32.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happened to me before . Last year half of my family died from cancer , only one died in car accident  . People were triggering me about cancer etc . Saying I wish you to die , all your family may get cancers and stuff like that , only because I was feeding that game ( not on purpose just enemy was strong ) , so I was toxic towards them as well . . Guess what RIOT did , they banned me instead of those people who were harassing me . So Riot ALL of you who work in there . Please die for me :) All your family members might get cancer too I dont care just like you didnt care about my situation .\n\nNow again got banned for being toxic , but they didnt care that my team mate Tresh said to me go die like for real , because he died in a fight. And I only was standing for myself .  So again, please RIOT die for me .\n\nBan me if you want , I dont have anything to lose as I lost everything already .\n\nI was keeping it in myself for one year and this recent report pushed it out of me ","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-16T20:49:44.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are definitely times where I want to go the extra step and really bring behavior like this to someones individual attention.  Unfortunately, this is not something we can help with in a ticket :(  The best ways for us to look at toxic behavior in-game is by using the report feature at the end of match.  In addition to this, we do have tools that look at in-game behavior (even without reports) to get an idea of who is being toxic, and levy any appropriate punishments.\n\nRest assured, if this guy is being a dick consistent game to game, he will be found, and he will be punished!","replies":[{"poster":"Phierce","date":"2016-12-14T00:13:35.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just had someone add me after a game just to tell me not to play a role i dont know how to play and proceeded to call me a %%%got...... after i had already left post game. name was RiseAboveXD    how do you report someone when you have already left post game.?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pryotra","date":"2016-06-18T03:24:57.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there a way to report someone pre-game lobby? Because I haven't played in a while and it wasn't possible to do when I did. \n\nIf things are the same, I did this exact thing with screen shots using the support tickets. It may take some filtering, but it eventually got to the right area.\n\nThis may not be smiled upon, but if someone is like this in pregame chat, but is saved by someone backing out, I should still have an option to report them. As I recall, the reason the tribunal didn't include pregame chat was because it was a separate system entirely and couldn't be added to the case.\n\nIf you have a better suggestion for this, please let me know. I probably won't play again, as currently I feel highly disenfranchised by Riot, but it would be helpful knowledge for me to have if I do come back, or someone else experiencing the same issues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KRapter231","date":"2016-06-16T21:03:29.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for leaving a reply!
