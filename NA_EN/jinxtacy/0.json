I signed onto my other account and then got unfriended immediately.  I tried to log in but my password had changed so I requested a password reset.  Then I noticed the e-mail had changed.  Oddly I was still logged on here so I haven't been asked for a new password as of yet, but there's someone out there with my account and wondering if there's an easy solution I'm overlooking.

I did that.  I was just wondering if there was some system workaround to resolve it on my own since I wasn't sure how long that wait would be if ever.  Apparently I'm twitch banned as well with 3 warnings despite not logging onto Twitch in ages.  Hopefully Riot staff can get to me soon.  Wish there was a contact number.  Took 20 minutes to fix my Blizzard account.","replies":[]}]}]}
