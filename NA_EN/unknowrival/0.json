Be real with me. If someone calls you the N-word for no real reason, then is it ok? No? Didn&#039;t think so...\r\nThen why is it okay for the support to call me the N-word at the last possible second in champ select before the game loads? FURTHER MORE, why is it okay for me to get chat banned and for that game to be used as the second &quot;offense&quot; of toxicity? Especially when the bot lane and top lane trio worked together to make my game a living hell and all decided to &quot;report me on false report accusations&quot;. I mean honestly, since I knew from the beginning that they were all going to make threats of reporting me, I kept the whole game squeaky clean. I wasn&#039;t in anyway toxic, yet I received a 25 GAME chat ban for that? For being called the N-Word? That&#039;s honestly unacceptable IMO. \r\nI would post the game logs but I don&#039;t see them or anyway to bring them back from when they popped up. This is kinda unbelievable Riot. I shake my head at how inefficient and corruptible/easily abused your report system is. I&#039;m outraged because it makes climbing ranked solo queue that much harder with limited communication.\r\n\r\nHere is the games, turns out I missed one where my buddy played with friends and they were toxic at him but I guess he got reported?

I understand he insulted you, but silently report him yourself, and don't make others do so too. First, each player should only report what they want, not what someone tells them to.
