I worded my last reply very confusingly. Yes I can reach his universe page just fine. But the link on his universe page (the link for Gnar's promo site) is the link that is a dead end.

Tbh I really thought you were talking about the Universe page when you mentioned the promo site, I'm not really sure what promo site you're referring to.
