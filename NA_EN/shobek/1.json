Stop!","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":29,"down_votes":11,"body":"Does League no longer feel fun? What is missing? Where did the happy feeling go? Where did the never say die attitude players had before go?  \n\nPlayers no longer have control of the game. We can not feel responsible for our losses because our customization&#039;s have been taken away and build strategy has been made less effective. Loyal players are also pushed away by champion changes that leave them estranged from the game. \n\nBelow are the 3 main areas of damage that i believe developers have been ruining their own game with. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOne - \n\nEveryone has Hybrid damage / True Damage - Homogenization of damage for all champs.  \n\nSince the advent of keystones ( thunderlords, Torch, Grasp , and now the runes reforged with even more) Counter-building was destabilized and made much less effective.  True damage in the new kits and items takes this a step further by penalizing building intelligently to counter your opponents. This dumbs down the game and lowers the effectiveness of strategy to counter op champs or enemy champs in general. \n\nCreativity used to win games. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTwo - \n\nThe removal of Runes ( old runes ) \n\nSince old runes have been removed and all we have left is keystone masteries; counterbuilding to adapt champions in champ select is virtually gone. This weakens champion diversity and strategy and exacerbates op champions OP ness. Our only option is to play op champs. We can&#039;t compensate for champions weaknesses with runes. \n\nWe used to consider the entire flow of a game like a story and use the old rune system along with items to narrate our window of opportunity. This was most effective in the early seasons when hybrid damage and true damage were at minimums.  Building to counter opponents was much more powerful then and any champion was viable if the build was smart enough. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThree - \n\nChampion Reworks\n\nChampion reworks alienate players and push people away from the game. For every person who liked a rework there are mains who had the game ruined for them by a rework.  Every champion that ever existed pre rework could have had adjustments made to their kits to be more balanced that wouldn&#039;t have changed the feel of the champion. Any ability has the ability to be tweaked and balanced. \n\nNo kit was ever impossible to balance. Riot just gave up on them. Thats the problem. \n\nAny time riot gave up on a champions kit they also gave up on anyone maining that champion and in return many of those players have given up on riot. \n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOther factors. \n\nYes there are other factors. Dynamic que forced on us sucked and pissed off alot of people. League is generally toxic. But i believe that the 3 above reasons are the main reason for the decline of the quality of the game. \n\nI hope that riot can get control of things or someone can make a Moba that is as interesting as League was in the early seasons before they destroyed strategy and accountability. \n\nWe used to lose and believe it was our fault because we could have won if we had a better strategy or build. Or better yet; We used to win because we had a better overall strategy and not just mechanics. \n\nThis does not exist anymore at anywhere close to the level of the early seasons. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nConclusion \n\nLeague is no longer the chess match it used to be. This makes me very very sad. \n\nI believe that is why no one cares to watch worlds anymore. There is no interesting strategy in comparison to old seasons. The complexity is gone and the introspection into the games left with it. There is nothing to study; Just an op champion clown fiesta where everyone one shots each other. If we wanted that we would go watch a first person shooter. \n\nPeople play LOL because it satisfy s something different. Something that no other game could. That satisfaction is going away because of certain changes that harmed strategy or destroyed what players liked. \n\nChange is good but not changes that destabilize and homogenize the game. \n\n\n\n\nThis is all just my opinion. But I&#039;m sure that many players resonate with this. \n\n\nThanks Everyone. \n\n\n\n~Shobek~","replies":[{"poster":"Nenthos","date":"2018-08-17T02:57:15.218+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agree with all points 100%.

We know it doesn’t feel good to hear that your champion is a “game health issue”, and it’s even more demoralizing when we don’t do anything to solve that.\nWhen we have talked about Aatrox, we’ve typically focused on his self-heal based gameplay, and how difficult it is to maintain. Tackling a project that large is something more appropriate for a full VGU or a champion class update, but that focus has led us to neglect Aatrox for far too long. Aatrox has other problems besides the dicey-ness of self-healing, and we’re taking this time to tackle some of those problems. Hopefully, we’ll come out the other side more comfortable giving Aatrox balance tweaks in the future.\nAs it stands, Aatrox is always perched on a fine line between smashing everything and not having any options at all. His abilities cost health, which makes fighting from behind even harder. And since his healing scales with his damage, building tanky not only hurts his kill potential, but also doesn’t make him that much harder to kill (because he sacrifices healing potential in the process). We want to give Aatrox more to do in the games he’s not running away with. That means making it more rewarding for him to invest some gold in durability, as well as making it less punishing for him to use his abilities.\n\nBasically repeating what i said.

Nothing else.\n\nSeeing as I was a Mordekaiser main, I know exactly how it feels. They didn't just change these champions for the sake of change, they either didn't work, and/or saw no play. No one played old Poppy, I'm sorry for the five people who miss her, but no one played old Poppy. No one played old Kat past season 1, Talon was the only one who saw some amounts of play, but ever since he lost his silence, he saw no play as well until his rework. These champions saw no play, their old kits either didn't work at all, or couldn't keep up with the new meta.","replies":[{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2018-08-17T07:25:24.563+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"there are 140 champions in the game.

Who cares if poppy had a .2 percent playrate. That .2 percent fucking love her. change her ult a bit and change  her passive a bit so she can get a bit more power.

Maybe instead of reducing all damage over 10% of your max HP by 50% maybe its just by 10%. and you can give back some of her power into her kit.)\n\ncontrary to popular opinion these champions held such terrible playrates because they were intentionally gutted and left there. It had nothing to do with how fun they were. People like to win, and they dont want to put in a lot of effort and deal with being garbage every time they play.

Her identity as a bruiser can easily be brought back with changes to her numbers. I still deadass play her as a bruiser and i think new poppy is just as enjoyable as the old one. I'd love to have her old passive back but it was just not healthy. She just needs to get her AD ratio's to be brought back to what they were.
