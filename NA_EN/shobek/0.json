But it needs addressed for Rank's sake. That's where the vast majority of active players try to be, and the longer the \"game\" is toxic, the more the players are, the more they get removed from the game, lose interest because they can't earn honor rewards or victorious skins..... The faster the player base is going to dwindle.\n\nI don't care so much about people leaving for natural game reasons..... but entirely preventable ones are another thing entirely.\n\nI guess it comes down to:\nDoes Riot lose more players due to balance patches which unleash unpredictable and overwhelming changes, or do they lose more players from player toxicity, or from Riot not behaving the way players expect them to.\n\nI'm willing to bet more leave due to Balance issues than anything, exacerbated by the fear they if they play 1-2 more months, they are going to get a perma ban because they react to those Balance issues/players who feed because of them.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-08-12T00:35:06.137+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Toxic players only enjoy being toxic when other people dont do it to them in return.\n\nPlus there is no chance of this happening, it would be moronic.","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2018-08-12T02:15:22.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not many actually enjoy being toxic.
