After several attempts at getting jungle monsters I had given up and decided to sit in spawn. I was penalized for bad behavior for having a piece of beep follow me around for the majority of the game and take everything cause of his chomp, yet it was still my fault I guess. Someone give me some sort of insight how the beep this works.","replies":[{"poster":"iiGazeii","date":"2019-04-12T23:51:38.874+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"You had a toxic player in your game, ruining your experience. \n\nYour response was to AFK and ruin everyone else's experience. \n\nPenalty deserved. \n\nDoes that other guy also deserve a penalty? Absolutely, that's a shitty thing to do to somebody. But penalties are not about the other person. Context does not matter. The only thing that matters is your behavior, and you behaved poorly. \n\nThe right thing to do would have been to focus on farming the botside jungle. He'd eventually either lose top for not being there and get reported by your entire team, or he would get bored and actually play his role. Instead, you made it a gray area where both people involved deserved a punishment, and you were the only one who was clearly throwing the game.","replies":[{"poster":"SI1V3RBU1L3T","date":"2019-04-12T23:59:09.264+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"I told the rest of my team that I will be afking and all they said was \"that's fine\".

The top laner ruined it because not only is the enemy top laner getting free gold and towers but the jungler can not get any gold at all. Without gold he can't get effectively so then the other laners can't get help. Most likely the troll would have inted free kills as well. So the one who deserves punishment is the top laner. He is the reason 4 people had their game ruined.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Soul Dealer","date":"2019-04-13T00:15:00.055+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"R107 Games","date":"2019-04-13T00:19:23.229+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Soul Dealer,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=c2hBVAxR,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2019-04-13T00:15:00.055+0000)\n>\n> &lt;*removed by moderation*>\n\nCalm down man, you will get banned if you use that kind of language.
