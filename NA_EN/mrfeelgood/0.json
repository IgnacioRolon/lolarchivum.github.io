Mac user","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After completing the most recent patch, I am no longer able to open the client to the \"Log In\" screen on my mac computer (for the a week now). A screen pops up displaying \"The client update has begun\" with \"launch\" above it. After clicking launch, the page disappears and the log in page refuses to pop up. I find it strange because i dont know know why the client went back to having the \"launch\" button. I thought having to launch the client ended many patches ago and usually the client goes straight to the Log In screen. I've read many discussions about similar problems. Some of the things suggested include: reinstalled league, deleted many files, force a repatch, and tried to repair the corrupt files, but nothing seems to help. Any suggestions?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-17T17:51:23.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For Macs, the culprit might actually be a connection issue blocking the launcher from coming up and accessing services.  Instead, I recommend running through the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot towards a fix.  Let me know if that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"MrFeelGood","date":"2017-08-17T21:38:09.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So i watched a couple of videos. My firewall has never been on and i switched my DNS to 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4 and that didnt seem to help. Also, watched packet buffering and determined that wasn't my problem since i never run anything else besides League while playing. Any other suggestions? Should i even have a launch button?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-17T22:09:19.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The patcher should just come up, if you have the screen with the Launch button then it sounds like you're still in the Legacy client.  It needs to update to the current version, but it sounds like it's still getting blocked.  Hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) in this case, and our tech team can work with you directly to get this figured out.","replies":[{"poster":"MrFeelGood","date":"2017-08-18T01:07:30.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will do that. Like i said before, i didnt have the Launch button until i tried to patch a couple days ago. After the patch reached 100% it crashed and then the launch screen appeared upon reopening league.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
