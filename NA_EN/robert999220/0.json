The FN+F6 option no longer works either, friend of mine can still use these keys, and I have updated everything to the latest versions, Anyone have a solution to this?","replies":[{"poster":"kUzi","date":"2017-06-16T19:20:58.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've fixed mine using a simple AHK script that activates windows taskbar for the key-press and instantly activates league of legends window after that.

To test if you have profiles that are causing issues, **close out Razer Synapse entirely** and hop into a custom game. If your media keys work now, you'll want to go back into Synapse to see what kind of profile or gaming settings may be enabled that would change your functions in a game of League. \n\nLet me know what changes.","replies":[]}]}
