She&#039;s my main and I&#039;ve put so much money into her, as you can obviously tell. I have every single skin, I don&#039;t want my favorite champion ruined beyond belief as Riot usually ends up doing. She has the most mains in the game, doesn&#039;t she? We absolutely have to make an outcry IF they mess her up, I&#039;m not saying they will. \r\n\r\nThey&#039;re right in saying her W isn&#039;t the greatest ability, and that she can&#039;t snowball nor fall off well. That&#039;s true, and separating bad Ahri&#039;s and letting them do worse from good ones who could do better sounds amazing, really. It does. \r\n\r\nBut why are we calling the MS buff on her Q &quot;too safe&quot;? I understand that yes, it is. But why are we looking at THAT when Fizz has a free fucking Zhonya&#039;s that deals a shitton of damage? I&#039;m sorry, using her Q at least requires some iota of dodging to make the MS buff useful. Fizz can outright dodge a Tibbers stun. How is Ahri too safe with her Q (she really is with her R, not debating that) when Fizz isn&#039;t?!\r\n\r\nPlease, at least, don&#039;t touch her Q being what it is aside from the movement speed buff (and if you do remove it, please compensate PROPERLY), and please keep R and E as they are. Spirit Rush and Charm are great, I&#039;d really hate to see them ruined.","replies":[{"poster":"xToxicOsirisx","date":"2018-02-18T02:33:19.285+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahri is a balanced champion.

That's not even his ult. \nYasuo doesn't need Flash because he can dash infinitely. \nKassadin doesn't need cooldowns on his longer-than-flash range ult. \n\nThere are far, far more safe and infuriating mobility problems in this game than Ahri's Q MS buff. And she's not even overpowered or frustrating, just very safe. For someone who excels at NOTHING ELSE, removing that seems stupid if they won't compensate for it properly.","replies":[{"poster":"2Charmnot2Charm","date":"2018-02-18T15:07:45.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Fizz q can only be used on enemy/neutral units. \n\nYasuo can only dash on enemy/neutral units.\n\nKassadin has a long cooldown rank 1 and even if he was able to spam it he will lose his entire mana bar to just the ultimate spam that he won't be able to fight back effectively.\n\nMeanwhile ahri has her safety at level 1 (assuming she doesn't take charm cause of an invade) and the only requirement to use it is to have 65 Mana and cast it.

She's kind of okay at being an assassin, kind of okay at being a control mage, kind of okay at everything, not great at anything. And while yes, the buff on the Q is really strong- it still takes you some time to stop and cast it, thus it can't be used quite as effectively as Katarina's W buff to dodge skillshots, it's really meant for you to turn your tail and run. \n\nHowever, all I'm asking for is proper compensation. Ahri isn't in too great of a spot right now anyway and her winrate is only high because most of her players are dedicated mains who know her ins and outs- not because she's particularly powerful. Bringing her down further is gonna delete her from the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Anonagon","date":"2018-02-18T03:03:08.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that she's pretty lackluster right now.

Sure, she falls off lategame and can't quite deliver damage, or CC, or really do much, but I think her main strength lies in her roaming potential. It feels really satisfying to me personally to roam and get my other laners fed and simply keep on top of map awareness and their jungler's position- she's like a mini jungler, really. One of the playstyles I have for her is \"Support Assassin\", which really does work well. \n\nThat said, I'd understand why some players don't find her satisfying. That said, my most recent Ahri game had me at 16/2/7 with the game lasting 28 minutes in a lane versing an Annie, who could've locked me down easily. All it took is Cleanse and roaming. She's just not great lategame no matter what you do, which is why you wanna rush midgame so badly with her. Played right, she's all sorts of satisfying and useful. Charm is really really strong, IMO.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2018-02-18T02:35:31.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably because everyone complains about the Q MS bonus.
