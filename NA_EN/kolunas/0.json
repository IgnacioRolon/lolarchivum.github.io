Both games i had kda,s that shouldve given me a s+ and a s- but instead gave me both an a+ and an a. I am disappointed with how the grading system has been working. I shouldve been able to get s's those games and get level 6 tokens for blitzcrank but it is unfair how it works for supports.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-31T04:41:58.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of the most frequently missed detail with the mastery grading system is that you aren't being graded based on your performance alone. Mastery grades are calculated based on what champion, which role, and how well you did compared to everyone else playing the same champ in the same role. You may have had a stellar KDA, but there's a chance that your vision score wasn't quite high enough.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kolunas","date":"2017-07-31T18:12:26.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Is there some website or something that can compare those games to others that played it? But also why compare someones play to another person? If they had a stellar game wouldnt it be more fair to reward them for doing amazing on said champion in said role instead of comparing it to other people who in turn have better games? I mean it shoulf be a factor yes but if they are having constant stellar games and they are getting the same mastery grade shouldnt the system change and adapt to those games?","replies":[]}]}
