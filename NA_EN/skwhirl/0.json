Hourglass is nice but leaves you completely vulnerable in a majority of situations. I am sure this has been brought up before but I highly highly doubt I am the first person to bring this up. I have been playing league since roughly right out of beta and there have been an extreme amount of item changes but there are so many outdated build paths or simple changes that I feel would help balance out some of the over the top team comps. I&#039;m interested in seeing others opinions about this idea. To op or a balanced idea, obviously make it a unique passive so you cant stack hourglass&#039;.","replies":[]}
