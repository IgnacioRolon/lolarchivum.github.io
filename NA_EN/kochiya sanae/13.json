If your team agrees then it&#039;s okay. If they still want you to play and say no, then it&#039;s still respectable, and you keep playing (unless you got health issues). But they shouldn't accuse you of wanting to leave because they think you only want to win\n\n**edit:** i treat all games modes of same importance because i dont discriminate\n\ni feel that even when modes are \"For fun\" some people might take it seriously, so i always try my best to make their experience better\n\nalso i never afk because that is selfish\n\nit seems like people are missing my point\n\nof course i want to surrender if im not having fun. But that doesn't mean im gonna afk if my team isn't okay with it. If they don't want to surr then they just need to say no. 2/5 or more \"No's\" and that's all it takes to keep me in the game.\n\nPeople missed the point of my post","replies":[]}
