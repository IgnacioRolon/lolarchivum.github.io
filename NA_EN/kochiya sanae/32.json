Supporters for the existence of ELO hell tend to claim that ELO hell is the continued series of losses because of bad teammates. However, people who attempt to disprove ELO hell argue back that because bad luck cannot play on and on for a long period of time, there has to be an even distribution between wins and losses, usually 50-50, if the player belongs in that ELO.\n\nHowever, according to the gambler's fallacy, the chance of success or failure of the next wave of attempt is independent of past occurrences. In other words, a person who suffers a loss because of bad teammates, may again suffer another loss from bad teammates. Just because the sample size of his games is large doesn't mean that he is supposed to win more just because he is a positive contribution to the team. Bad teammates ruin everything. Now let's look at this mathematically. \n\nIf a person is actually better than his ELO, then let's assume that he has positive impact on the game, and therefore has a 60% chance of winning each game given the random distribution of various teammates after he enters queue. That means he has a 40% chance of losing. To lose 5 times in a row because of bad luck, that chance would be .40^5, or 1%. With literally millions and millions of players, this 1% is in abundance, and not that uncommon. That 1% is unfairly subjected to the hell of, well, ELO hell. Low probability but low probability is still possible. He will then literally decrease in skill (not because of his own fault) and burn in ELO hell for the next month because of diminished confidence. Therefore, a potential rising player has to spend another month to grind his confidence, ELO, and skill back up because of shitty matchmaking.\n\n#foreverplat","replies":[]}
