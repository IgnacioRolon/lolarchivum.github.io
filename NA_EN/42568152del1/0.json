Why is that? Well I have had more than one account to level 30 and I started playing at the end of season 3. Obviously I was new and I sucked but back then all of my friends were playing and it was fun. We had a friend( I am still a friend with the guy) who was high gold and even reached Plat. This was when Master hadn&#039;t been introduced. So this guy would win lane, give us advice, play private matches to help us learn. His presence alone was enough to win the game. As I got better I also did this- I won lane, I bullied other lanes and we would win. Or,alternatively, I would help the fed person in our team and he would carry. All the youtubers say that you can better only yourself and that whether you win or lose is up to you, which was true a couple of years ago, but now it&#039;s absolutely irrelevant. The macro play, which was introduced to help the pro teams and organized teams in general, doesn&#039;t allow you to shine. It&#039;s simple now- you have a stupid team and you will lose. You being fed does not have the same impact as before. I won&#039;t be playing LoL. In fact, I told a friend that I would return only if all of our friends return and we play together. And that won&#039;t happen because even that plat player is so annoyed with ranked that he doesn&#039;t care whether he will win a skin( which is nothing too fancy) and a border. But please Riot. Not for me, but for the new players. Trolls will always exist, but you can encourage the new players to learn and become better, instead of just playing 1 champ, by showing them that their skill matters, that if they mess up they will most likely lose and that if they have a fed person they should help that guy. By doing so you will encourage them to learn. I can&#039;t count the comebacks enemy teams have made due to my team being worse. I had a game where I was 7 0 3 and I was stomping but the game got longer and we lost. This should never happen. I will just give a small example with Dota- you lose gold for dying, your max level is higher and if someone gets fed he destroys you. Here he gets fed but then you make a comeback and win. And that player is pissed because he did extremely well but lost. Also you could make it so that if you played badly you lose a lot of lp and if you played well you lose minimal amounts. For example, 8 3 4 and lost-you don&#039;t lose 20 lp but 10 or 9. 0 11 4 and won due to good teammates- you win 5 instead of 19 or 20. And the carry of the team doesn&#039;t win 21 lp but 35. Just some ideas. I hope you see the merits of this. I would be extremely satisfied If I carried 3 bad players and get 30-40 lp along with the other guy who carried and also wouldn&#039;t be pissed if I lost not 20 but 10 lp because I played well in the match. Tell me what you guys think. Feel free to add ideas and respect other people&#039;s opinions, please.","replies":[]}
