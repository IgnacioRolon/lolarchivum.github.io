I might come back if I am extremely bored, but this time I think not. I want to ask you guys. Do you think LoL is worth the time we invest in it? Now I am no Faker and thank God because those poor pro players don&#039;t get to have a normal life. Anyway.... I have been playing Soloq and I find it useless. On this account I have a bunch of skins thanks to the hextech system. I also have accounts on other servers, where I also have great skins. That begs the question. Is the reward worth it? You get Gold or even Plat and what- a crappy skin and a nice border. Big deal. And now I want to mention the biggest problem in this game&#039;s ranked system. Even if you reach Challenger. Even if you are among the best Soloq players, you get nothing. The amount of trolls up there is less but it&#039;s stressful to play because everyone is good and you just shorten your life by putting so much effort in the game. And for what? The Soloq Challenger players get nothing. Sure some of these players are in teams such as Fnatic Skt and so on. But the majority are not. By getting to Challenger( which is an extremely hard task and you have to sacrifice everything else to achieve it) you increase your chance of getting noticed by a great team or join a newly formed one. That&#039;s your reward. Because only the pro teams play for the cup and the money. Which is a lot only for the winners and even they split it into five parts. So each winner gets around 200 000. If you don&#039;t win your team earns 250 000, I think, which is 50 000 for each player. And so the sums get lower. But yeah, the pros at least get money for fucking up their health. What about everybody else. And I am not speaking of myself or the others around  my current level(silver) and I have been higher for a while but even then it didn&#039;t matter. Ok that is understandable. But the soloq Challenger players....those who are not in teams already. What do they get. A border and crappy skins, just like the rest of us. Maybe give them money. Free champions and the ability to get a free skin instead of paying for it. Make soloq worth the time and sometimes the money we spent. I ,personally, have NOT given a penny for this game or any other I won&#039;t, even if I ever do return.","replies":[{"poster":"42568152DEL1","date":"2017-07-10T07:33:16.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LoL isn't amusing. It's boring and monotonous. The first 3 minutes of a game are always the same. There is not that much content or development and all you do is just fight. And to compare soloq Challenger and pro players,who are also Challenger  is quite relevant. Why aren't these people, who are of the roughly same skill level as the pros don't get rewarded accordingly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"amazinick1213","date":"2017-07-08T17:49:53.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tldr?","replies":[]},{"poster":"BALDG1VEN BOOMER","date":"2017-07-08T15:07:21.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you compare solo queue and pro play lmfao","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-07-08T14:35:00.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"according to what you say, what's the point of playing any game?\n\nAmusement.","replies":[]}]}
