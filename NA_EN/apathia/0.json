I open it, then it stops working. It says another instance of the launcher is running and asks me if I want to terminate it. It doesn't proceed past that step. I click \"okay\", and then the client closes. When I check the task manager after, \"LoL Patcher (32 bit)\", \"PVP.net Patcher Kernel (32 bit)\", and \"Riot Client Patcher (32 bit)\" are all still running in the background. Even after I end the tasks and when I try to open the League client, the same problem occurs. In addition, League of Legends is listed as unavailable for some reason in Settings->System->Apps and features.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/ln2wX\nhttp://imgur.com/a/MCui6\n\nI have also tried the following options:\n-reinstalled\n-ran as administrator\n-deleted the two files named \"S_OK\" and \"release manifest\" in the \"release\" folder.\n-deleted the \"logs\", \"META-INF\", \"lol.properties\", and \"LoLClient.exe\" in the \"deploy\" folder.\n\nPlease help.","replies":[{"poster":"Eunson","date":"2016-07-29T21:16:51.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Fix is to simply run as admin even if you are admin you still need to right click - run as admin.

Yes I believe this is exactly what happened to my roomate and after hours of searching online and asking Rito they didn't have an answer (he eventually sent me a text asking me if I had any ideas). He had also upgraded to Windows 10 from 7 and had this exactly happen. If I remember correctly, rito can correct me if I'm wrong and has a simpler answer, you need to uninstall league, open File Explorer and go to your profile (C:\\Users\\profile_name), allow yourself to view hidden folders (sorry can't remember and not on my computer to find out on for Windows 10) AppData, Then I think It's in Local or LocalLow (maybe both)??? you need to delete the files left over that are related to League of legends, LOL, Riot Games (wish I could provide the exact path but I'm at work with no computer with League installed). Then re-install league and it should work - maybe POROCLES can assist where the file are in AppData.\n\n\nUninstall League\nC:\\Users\\profile_name\nAppData - Will have to enable invisible folders\nLocal or LocalLow or Roaming - Locate files/folders related to league (LOL_Client/League of Legends/Riot_Games/etc.) and delete these lingering files\nInstall League of Legends\n\n\n*EDITED TO INCLUDE ROAMING FOLDER IN CASE OTHERS HAVE THIS ISSUE","replies":[{"poster":"Apathia","date":"2016-07-30T00:40:38.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After I uninstalled League, I tried to find any remaining LoL files in Local and LocalLow, but there weren't any lingering files/folders in there. There are, however, Riot Games folders in C:\\Users\\Owner\\AppData\\Roaming and in C:\\ProgramData. There are also League of Legends folders in C:\\Users\\Owner\\AppData\\Roaming\\Riot Games.

My roommate struggled with that by himself for days and Rito didn't have a solution. That issue has come back for him though unfortunately...twice in the last 8 months. Guess it's not a permanent fix. I don't actually work for Riot so I couldn't tell you the cause or how to prevent it; this is pretty much band-aid for now (maybe yours will be permanent, lets hope). Windows 10 is considered \"new\" still I guess so it'll probably be patched one day.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Apathia","date":"2016-07-29T03:40:05.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was fine the day before on Windows 7.","replies":[{"poster":"√Åkura","date":"2016-07-30T16:28:41.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make sure your anti-virus software is not blocking your client from working as well.
