It seems many have gotten their RP allotted since, but I've still yet to receive any. The $20 RP was pending in my bank account for a good 10 hours before it went through, but after nearly 18 hours the RP is still absent. Opened a ticket same time as well but no word from them. Any thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-03T17:55:43.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'd like to help you out with this and see what's going on.
