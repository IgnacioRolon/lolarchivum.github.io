This isn't a 1v1 like Starcraft. This is a 5v5 where even two teammate's **_personality compatibility_** can be the deciding factor. Player A and Player B might both play like shit despite both players being good if both of them are trying to take the helm when it comes to shot-calling.\n\nHeck, even opponent's playstyle could be a deciding factor. That oponent may not be as good as you normally, but if they're much more experienced playing against your specific playstyle, they'll likely wipe the floor with you.\n\nThen all of this is compounded by it being a 5 person team. Four people could play like shit, but because that one Katerina knew how to capitalize on her lead and carry the team on her back, the 4 players that shouldn't have won will still get a victory.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ozuraak","date":"2017-06-01T09:44:28.022+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.leagueofgraphs.com/summoner/euw/beatstyler\n\nFriend of mine.
