I can't click on my chat, minimize the club chat, or click on start game without my client experiencing a lot of lag. It's reminding me of the old days of starting a web page on a DSL connection. Everything is slow and delays massively on responding to commands. I'd like to not leave my club, but this is getting frustrating. Especially if I get disconnected from game and have to restart the client. Any ideas on how to fix this besides leaving my club?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-05T21:59:59.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"To be honest, this is the first time I've heard of this kind of client lag from clubs.  Did you ever have issues or lag whenever you tried to start a chat/join a normal chatroom?  Also, does the lag only occur within the League client or do you notice the lag happening for your entire PC? \n\nTo help rule out some common causes we usually see (in this case potentially issues with the connection between your network and our chat servers), can you run through the steps in the [Connection Troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664)?  Best case scenario, the issue is fixed. Worst case scenario, we know it's not a network issue and can more quickly isolate the cause.","replies":[{"poster":"Garrotte","date":"2016-05-06T01:16:58.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to chime in here to say that I too experience this exact same lag. Although lag is a really bad term to use,because really its frame dropping.","replies":[]}]}]}
