The new Thornmail supposedly counters lifesteal items but Yasuo with Bloodthirster heals for more damage than Thornmail hands out. Honestly, the item has a bit of an identity crisis, since it's trying to be \"fair\" to lifesteal items while also giving a feeble amount of armor in compensation. BT+IE renders Thornmail completely useless, whereas the old Thornmail would be that much more punishing against that item combo.\n\nSorry, but the new Thornmail is as sharp as a bowling ball.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2017-10-03T14:31:11.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I loved and hate the old {{item:3075}}, super cheap and efficient that you could buy this 1st item as an adc just to watch the other adc cry or into 3-5 ad enemy comp, it was just 2 good and the reflect dmg was so good for clearing out minions,pets,jungle,large ad marksman dps,practically negated lifesteal.

It's become like {{item:3068}}  gutted, cause it's pretty much useless on most ad tanks since they won't be building magic pen nor{{item:3001}}  to get the most out of the capes passive against champs but even then, I'm pretty sure the dmg if neglible, 400 arm what's the bonus to reflect? a measly 30ish dmg that gets cut in half by their mr barely putting a dent in their health.","replies":[]}]}
