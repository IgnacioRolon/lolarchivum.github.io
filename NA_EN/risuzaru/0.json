Since that didn't happen, does it mean Japan isn't getting its own server in the end?\r\nCan we have any news from Riot?\r\nYou could save me and other japanese players some time...\r\nI'm searching for any news possible - related to japanese server - everyday... there's nothing.\r\n\r\nIn one week there is Japanese League season 2 start. Sadly, many players in Japan feel disappointed - that there is no server still, and ignored - since you don't share any information about server work progress (if there is any).","replies":[{"poster":"I Main Samus","date":"2015-05-17T08:30:49.491+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"This does seem pretty important.

Based on my knowledge Japan is hard to break into for a foreign company.  So there might have been some cultural or legal roadblock slowing riot down.\n2. As the turn of Konami to mobile devices and the popularity of the DS over there have shown, Japan's preference in how you play games is important too.  So trying to break a PC online game into a market that I think is starting to favor mobile devices is a hard business decision to make.","replies":[{"poster":"satsujinsha","date":"2015-05-19T03:27:25.278+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know, that Japanese people love their cuisine, they prefer to eat everything that's traditional japanese food.\nMost of them are against fast - unhealthy - food.\nMany years ago noone could imagine how easy it will be for a foreign companies to come here, with their McDonalds and KFC everywhere around.\n\nAnother example:\nStill, few years ago everyone prefered mobile phones only made in Japan (for Japanese use only)... now - almost everyone have Apple's Iphone.\nPlease don't tell us how \"hard it is to break into Japan for a foreign company\"...\n\nHave you seen Riot's marketing plan for Japan at least?\nBecause, you're talking, as if Riot was just about to make decision now - go to Japan or not... when, in fact, they're already in Japan for more than one year... all tests for a game and server in Japan are done and all we need is \"press the launch button\".\nThey were planning to launch the server in Japan for 5/5/2015 - two weeks ago - it was Children Festival day for Japan (Golden Week).
