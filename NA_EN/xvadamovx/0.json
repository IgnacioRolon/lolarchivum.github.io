Drops down to 3rd in gold and is 4th in plat and 7th in Plat+. \n\nTakeing a look at winrates for all champions.\nBronze. #20 as top, #44 in mid.\nSilver. #26 top, # 83 mid.\nGold. # 37 top. #125 mid.\nPlat. #81 top. # 128 mid.\nPlat  + # 79 top. # 135 mid.\n \nLets look at this with a bit more detail. I'm going to now check his position placments and also look for how many champions have a 5% gap in win rates vs him. Also worth a mention, from Bronze to gold he is played as a mid more often then top, plat and plat + we see him top more then mid.\n\nBronze. As a top. 2/46 best win rate in role, 53.38% but it takes till champion at 41/54 to hit a 5% gap. He is 8/54 for kills, 53/54 for deaths ( 2nd highest deaths as a top might be a better way to word this). 50/54 for assists, 2/54 for cs and 3/54 for gold generated. His damage to champs puts him at 14/54  and his damage taken is  45/54 (this is a positive imo, as hes not a tank so soaking damage is not his job.)\n\nGoing off win rates he is not the problem that people make him out to be, but he is an excessively annoying champion if your main has a bad matchup.  I really think it would be more constructive if folks would stop complaining that he is op and/or Broken and just focus in on the fact he is unfun to play vs and excessively frustrating in numerous bad matchups.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shahamut","date":"2017-07-15T02:28:32.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Pretty sure Zac is banned more in high elo...","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GreenVillage","date":"2017-10-18T17:54:05.473+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Dont ask in this forum.

Just levels 1 and 2. \n\nPeople often make the mistake of letting yasuo poke/trade/harass before they have all of their skills. Yasuo's mid game is pretty bad unless he snowballs hard early, which really shouldn't happen. His late game is slightly worse (damage wise) than any other marksman because of the reduced crit, but his utility and in fight mobility make up for it, so his late game is pretty decent as long as he isnt #1 diving into a team fight.\n\nEDIT: I also love how people like to talk about how OP his defensive abilities are. How long has Yasuo been #1 or #2 for worst KDA and most deaths per game? All elos too...\n\n\"Its just bad players bringing his numbers down\"\n\nSo Yasuo takes skill?\n\n\"Yasuo is a brain dead champion, who can EZ carry 1v9\"\n\nummm... what?\n\nLets face it, his defenses are laughable at best.","replies":[]}]}]}
