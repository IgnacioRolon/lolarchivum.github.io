Now this happens every 1 min and after i restart lol and connect back to the game, the message will popup as soon as i connect and it would disonnect me. I already got 2 leaverbuster punishments out of that. Really annoying. Fix this thing because i dont wanna waste 3 hours of my life waiting for a game just because of the game's problems","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-11T21:45:23.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since the connection error occurs fairly consistently when you play, there seems to be an issue with your computer maintaining a stable and consistent connection to the individual Game Server.

Riot tech support hasnt helped me one bit and just told me its my ISP and its not at all i actually just had a guy here and said my ping on everything else is fine it has to be the receiving server.. plus like you said since 6.9 lots of connection issues.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-12T22:21:49.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't speak to what the Specialist told you in your ticket, given that they have had a chance to work with you one-on-one and go over logs.  \n\nHowever, this does not appear to an issue isolated to the individual game server.  If this was indeed an issue on the game server end, then all 10 players in every single match would be experiencing the issue, since they are all connecting to the same exact server.  Given that this is not happening, then we need to look at other possible root causes.\n\nThe best advice I can offer is to keep working with the Tech Specialist in your ticket!  They will continue to work with you in order to find a solution.","replies":[{"poster":"Existencexx","date":"2016-05-13T00:26:45.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they told me to contact my isp and thats all i heard","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Existencexx","date":"2016-05-11T19:34:54.654+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i know the feeling ive been dealing with support having the same issues and nothing has been fixed yet i dont get it","replies":[]},{"poster":"TungTut","date":"2016-05-13T01:40:15.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a same issue too.
