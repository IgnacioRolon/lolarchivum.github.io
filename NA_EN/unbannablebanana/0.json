I would just like to apologize and ask for ONE last chance to redeem myself. I will reform and be a better person. I was having a bad day and I said some really mean things to my teammates because I was angry, and I know I shouldn&#039;t take it out on my teammates, but I did, and I am sorry for that.

Not a big deal, personally I just am going back to playing Dota 2 since all my friends are playing it just because their support system and ban system actually work . You also don't get people like SJW Riot banning you for basically nothing and then people like these toxic trolls on the boards that have nothing better to do than say you deserved it (the boards community is absolute garbage btw don't expect someone to actually show some sense of kindness or empathy). The fact of the matter is this system does nothing but line the pockets of Riot and the community will always be unless they actually just start chat bans just lock you out of connecting to the chat portion of lol . But Riot will always see you as someone that is toxic and they have the typical SJW mentality of not caring about anyone's views but their own (this is why trump won the election btw lol).\n\n This is why they never overturn chat bans and this is why they lie about the 0.06% when in fact that number is much higher since most of the accounts are not active (if i had to guess somewhere between 2.5 & 7.5% are actually permabanned due to chat). Just move to a game where they value the player not because they never have bad days or don't get fed up with trolls but because they love their games. A supportive and caring community knows we all have flaws and doesn't berate others for having them.  This one will always do the later because they in reality get their kicks from posting and saying you are toxic.\n\n I think everyone has flaws that they need to work out but you people aren't a supportive community that helps people grow its one that points fingers and calls people hate mongers without even knowing them or the situation(Just like SJWs shout racist,misogyny and hobo-phobic).  This community is known as one of the most toxic for a reason, just move on from them and let these kinds of people wallow in the mud of SJW Riot. \n\n\nI understand anger and that it gets the best of us. If you want a friend or someone that understands to help you transition into other moba games then I'll extend my hand. I even setup a new hotmail if anyone wants to  contact me so I can add them on steam. \n\nanewdoorTodota@hotmail.com\n\n\n I don't want responses from anyone (that includes Riot members) here other than UnbannableBanana, because I don't want a fight (unlike some of you). I would rather help someone when they are down rather than kick them in the chest like most of you just did. I hope you people are ashamed that you offer no kindness to someone that is clearly down. I hope that one day when you are down someone kicks you so you know how it feels and you never will do crap like the above posts again. You absolutely disgust me with your actions of pride and malice and hope I never actually meet you people. \n\n\nBut to UnbannableBanana, \n\nI hope you can see past what the others are saying and just go on to have fun in another game because the people on these boards will show you no kindness and neither will Riot. Just move on and be all the better for not being a part of this absurd community.
