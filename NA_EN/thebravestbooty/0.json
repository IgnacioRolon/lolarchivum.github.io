I looked into this for you, but didn't see anything out of the ordinary.  In fact, it looks like you already have 3 tokens!  You may need to restart your client, your loot might have lost sync and didn't update the token in your inventory.  Grats! :D","replies":[{"poster":"TheBravestBooty","date":"2018-01-19T01:43:25.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply! Definitely a sync problem. After the next game I played, I was notified that a token entered my loot! Figures once I said something it corrected its self. Thanks for you help :)","replies":[]}]}]}
