Possible solutions there right now look like lower Q damage below rank 5 (55-235 instead of 75-235?) and higher W CD below rank 5 (22-14 instead of 18-14?).\n\nHey Meddler, as someone who has played up to Master Tier with Zed, I just want to give you some insight on what I think about that nerf and what could be done, just some food for thought from someone that knows the in's and outs of him.\n\nThe Q damage thing is good, I'd say that is pretty solid. Question though: If you nerf the damage on the Q, are you going to up the damage a BIT on when the Q goes through minions? Because early on currently, if it goes through minions, it isn't doing very much damage. If this is the point, then by all means go for it, I'm just making sure you realize it will be doing little to nothing to enemies if it hits a minion, which is fine I guess.\n\nThe W nerf I don't feel is the right way to go about it, but let me explain:\n\nZed's W already has a decently long CD tied to it, another thing about it is that it IS the skill you max LAST, so it is always on a high CD until later on. Whenever I'm against the good players in ranked games, they actually know how to take advantage on Zed when his W is on CD, if I use it under tower I'm already getting ganked. If I use it for harass, I'm already getting harassed back because after I use it I can't retaliate unless I can go for a kill. In my opinion, I feel the W CD is already long enough. Maybe you could elaborate on why you feel it needs to be higher? His opponent already has 18 seconds to do whatever to him, so I'm curious.\n\nAs for what I would do:\n\nIf I was to nerf Zed, my nerfs would consist of possibly making it so that Zed needs to hit a FULL combo (W E and Q) on them for maximum damage. Maybe make the q do less on it's own, but have the combo actually do meaningful damage, making it so he can't just harass without burning an escape, and making it so his harass is on a much higher CD if he want's it to do meaningful damage.\n\nIf I didn't use that for a nerf, I'd say to change how his ult works again with Shadow placement. I would have to think hard about this one, however. How it stands currently is very frustrating for the person being ulted because of how he can just port back, on the other hand Zed used to be a suicide bomber with his old ult, but it was way too easy to kill someone with it, and the damage was near unavoidable. Maybe try something else with his ult shadow placement, or how it works?\n\nThat's just my 2 cents on the proposed changes, and some of my own. Hope you take all of this into some possible consideration.","replies":[{"poster":"KSHarrison","date":"2016-03-19T22:54:08.078+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":3,"body":"Awesome reply, knowledgeable and not overbearingly aggressive like so many other suggestions, with good insight for other readers too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2016-03-20T00:46:19.153+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":">The Q damage thing is good, I'd say that is pretty solid.

If this is the point, then by all means go for it, I'm just making sure you realize it will be doing little to nothing to enemies if it hits a minion, which is fine I guess.\n\nI'm fairly certain it's meant to be a nerf to his waveclear. Upping the damage after the first hit would negate this change.\n\nPersonally I'd say it's his wave clear that needs to take some hits. There's no reason why an assassin, yet alone a manaless one like Zed should have such great waveclear. A traditional weakness of assassins is that mages can shove them back, Zed on the other hand pushes mages back, which is just stupid.\n\nI'd personally say increase the damage drop-off on his Q against creeps, reduce his E damage VS creeps and remove his ability to proc passive on creeps. For the reduced Q damage VS creeps this would mean after the first hit his Q deals something like 40% to additional creeps and 60% to additional champs. For the E I'd say around 75-80% damage VS creeps.\n\nThese changes would hurt Zeds waveclear and make it possible for a mage to actually push him under tower, which I feel they should be able to do since they're investing a long term resource while Zed doesn't.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sneakyy XD","date":"2016-03-19T20:21:12.609+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":37,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OsFkRcjW,comment-id=0016,timestamp=2016-03-19T20:08:56.583+0000)\n>\n> Usual disclaimer: Win rates, pick rates and ban rates are useful information, but we don't believe they should drive balance decisions.\n\nAnd yet you guys always use win rates, pick rates, and ban rates as evidence or reason for a champion being OP\n\nEvery single time one of you comments on a champion's balance, it contradicts something you have previously said or done.

Altering build paths is something everyone should be doing in every game but there are occasions where you put yourself on the back foot to do it and that's less good. Zed swapping a Serrated rush for Hexdrinker is cool, it makes sense against AP. A mage swapping Morello for Athene's if they're against a threatening mage is great. A support rushing Sightstone versus a ganking jungler or leaving it a tad later versus a farming jungler is great. A bulky top laner against an AP tank/mage top can rush Spectre's, or against an AD they can rush Warden's Mail, etc. The important thing to note here is that few trade offs are made. The top laner is happy with either Spectre's or Warden's because they do the job you need them to do at that stage of the game - you're not pissed off that you can't itemise some other form of bulk because you don't need it. The mage isn't (too) pissed off about having to buy Chalice instead of Idol because it's still mana regen and they want that anyway. Zed is happy with Hexdrinker becaue he's still getting AD and that's all he needs to worry about.\n\nThen you get to mage vs Zed. You get something you don't want at that point of the game (AP without mana regen and CDR), which denies you of something you very much need to do what you're expected to (mana for waveclearing and trading back with the enemy laner) and the reward is... that Zed has to work slightly harder to murder you. I don't mind swapping Ignite with Exhaust and stuff like that but for a lot of mages not rushing mana regen is a serious hindrance and in the end it's essentially being done just so that you have *some* chance of surviving Zed. Seeker's doesn't reduce his kill threat to zero, and he can ult twice in the cooldown of Exhaust. His late game also frankly isn't bad enough to justify ruining his enemy laner's laning phase.\n\nIf itemising against enemy champions was such a painful experience in other class or champion matchups then I'd be fine but mages are the only class in the game reliant on buying non-combat stats (mana) early and that means they're the only class that misses out on something they need if they choose to itemise against their enemy laner. That's always going to feel unfair for the person having to ignore mana and go for Seeker's because... it just objectively is unfair. It only happens to them, there's nothing comparable.\n\nIf there was a mana regen + armor item that built into an AP + CDR + MP5 item then I think itemising against Zed would be healthy and justifiable as counterplay but until such convenient itemisation exists it's always going to be a one-sided trade in his favour. And you can't expect people to be OK with that.","replies":[{"poster":"DumplingChow","date":"2016-03-20T06:41:27.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Late game, Zed statistically has a worse chance of winning the game.

Zed has a couple of massive flaws late game that could make you think he's worthless late (the hard counter situations of QSS/Zhonya's are almost unique to him), but they don't actually hold him back too much, they just restrict him. He's still a fantastic duelist against particular champions and if he decides to splitpush he can output a lot of pressure.\n\nObviously none of this is really new, he's being nerfed for a reason after all. But I really do think Zed's late game weakness is heavily overstated.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Devo Hes","date":"2016-03-19T20:17:16.552+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"You're actually supposed to base your entire build path and itemization for the team you are facing....","replies":[{"poster":"YumaS2Astral","date":"2016-03-20T00:34:38.518+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Devo Swag,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OsFkRcjW,comment-id=000b00000000,timestamp=2016-03-19T20:17:16.552+0000)\n>\n> You're actually supposed to base your entire build path and itemization for the team you are facing....\n\nI think the main problem is that against Zed, you in fact need to build Zhonya. The problem is that almost all mages cannot afford to build Zhonya as a first item because other items are usually more important for them to rush. This is especially in the case of mana-based mages which need mana/mana regeneration items to cover their needs. They can't afford to rush Zhonya, but are forced to do so because of Zed. They can still ignore Zhonya and build their core items regardless, but this means Zed has a lot more kill potential on them, which means they are at the risk of feeding.\n\nGenerally, counterbuilding is healthy if you are not forced to lose any stats when doing that. Against Zed, however, this is not the case. Most mages are forced to lose CDR/mana regeneration to rush Zhonya. This makes them unable to compete with Zed's waveclear potential, as most of the mage's waveclear cost a lot of mana. This means that even if Zed is unable to kill them due to Zhonya, he can still outfarm them, push them under tower, and roam freely. This puts mages into a situation where they are unable to do much against Zed.\n\nThere are also other problems. The first is that Zhonya by itself is an extremely expensive item with an horrible buildpath means that rushing it will be a pain for most mages and by the time that you complete it, Zed will probably have outfarmed you a lot and even killed you. And lastly, Zed himself does not need to worry, he can just build a Maw of Malmortius and do not care about what the enemy mage can do against him. Oh, and Hexdrinker by itself already protects him from mages, while Seeker's Armguard still don't protect you from Zed.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
