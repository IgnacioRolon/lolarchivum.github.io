Our punishment system and the Honor system are much more complicated than that. Toxicity in the League of Legends community is negativity in all it's forms. That means that early GG's, sarcastic congratulations, spamming, whining, calling for reports, and harassment are included in this definition.\n> \n> Any comments that distract people (even the enemy team) rather than help them, flame rather than aid them are negative behavior that holds you back from progressing.

This is not something up for debate, and attempting to ignore the direct parallel between the ban system in league and a criminal court in both being means of administering justice and enforcing good behavior is just ignorant at best.\n\nYou call your teammates \"awful,\" \"garbage,\" and \"terrible.\" You tell your teammates they \"lost the game\" and accuse them of griefing. What context justifies that? Did it help anything? Did it make people play better? Did any good come of it?\n\nAnd now, when people try to explain that Riot, as a private company running a video game, doesn't need to look at extenuating circumstances, convene a jury, or anything else if they want to deprive you of your ability to play this video game with this account, you start calling us \"obtuse,\" \"stupid,\" and \"ignorant.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Skorcher","date":"2019-02-16T11:37:28.754+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Yes, I called the one teammate who afk'd, flamed the team and told people to get cancer garbage.\n\nAnd yes, when you purposefully state \"this isn't a criminal court\" while completely ignoring the reasoning behind the post, you are being obtuse.  \n\nDo you honestly not see any parallel between a real life justice system and Riot's one?

What could it have accomplished?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#**NOTHING.**\n\nThat is why toxic chat is so difficult to justify. If a teammate is saying nasty things, inting, or otherwise being unpleasant, telling them to stop won't help. You could've put an immediate stop to hearing your teammate wish cancer on you by muting. Arguing back just amplifies the problem.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRiot is not a government, representative or otherwise. They are a private entity that generously grants you access to their game that they own. If they suddenly decided to ban everyone and close up shop, they would be within their rights to do that. They're closer to an aggravated dad trying to drive his family to Disneyland but Mary and Timmy haven't learned to get along yet and the bickering is driving poor Dad up the wall, so he says \"if you two keep fighting, no Disneyland.\" Then Mary pokes Timmy, Timmy screams that Mary is a boogerbrain, and Dad makes a U-turn. Timmy then screams \"BUT SHE STARTED IT!\" Do you think Dad should then say \"oh, well in that case everything is fine; let's go see Mickey\"? Maybe when everyone calms down, Timmy will explain that Mary poked him, and Dad will ask Mary if that's true, and (hopefully) she admits that it is, so she'll get an admonishment about not provoking her brother.\n\nBut they don't get Disneyland.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
