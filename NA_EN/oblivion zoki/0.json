Instead you can buy Ashe with 450 IP which is incredibly cheap, get Garen for free from following riot on twitter (or also for 450 IP), save the essence to perm a more expensive shard (ideally a 6300 tier champ) and use the shards with a third shard to get a random champion permanent through a reroll.","replies":[{"poster":"DartExplosion10","date":"2016-06-14T03:09:36.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-14T01:11:18.938+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is correct!
