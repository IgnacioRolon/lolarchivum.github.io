That means 100+30+4+9+85 (from base armor) = 228. That's nowhere near 300 armor. Cait had around 340 AD, plus armor shredding from black cleaver, plus 45% armor penetration from LDR. Even if she were dealing true damage (which she wasn't), it still wouldn't be 450 damage without criting, though she still would hurt alot. But that doesn't come without a price, she invested a lot to do all that and had no resistances at all apart from her runes, so she was rather squishy. If she managed to actually AA several times for the black cleaver to stack without being killed, she either positioned flawlessly, her team peeled for her flawlessly, or your team failed to target her. Either way, they deserve to be rewarded for playing well, or your team deserved to be punished for not being up to the par. \n\nNothing wrong happened, you and your team were just outplayed. It happens, accept it, learn from it, and take the lesson to the next. Shifting the blame onto the game instead is the worst you can do, because you'll never improve with that attitude.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2017-03-02T08:43:19.975+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm really curious how you had \"300 armor without ult\" with \n{{item:3078}} {{item:3083}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3053}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3075}}?\nbase armor at 18 = 84.4\narmor from items = 130\narmor from runes = 13.2\narmor from masteries = +5% bonus armor (7.2)\ntotal = 234.8.\n\nAlso I'm curious why you bought a thornmail over randuin's.\nAnd how you think caitlyn with\n{{item:3071}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3036}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3085}} {{item:3006}} \ncould hit for 450 damage through a minimum of 105 effective armor with non crits.
