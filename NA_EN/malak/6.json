At level 6, Sona (using her since she is one of the squishiest champs in the game) will have 944 HP. Assuming that Electrocute is dealing true damage too, then it is dealing 33% of Sona&#x27;s HP. You rounded all the up to 40% unnecessarily. This is also considering that she is one of the squishiest champions in the game, who we expect to blow up to damage.

Hell, even when considering all the damage true it still wasn&#x27;t &quot;nearly 40%&quot; like you seem to say. It was 33%, and I don&#x27;t know what world you live in that allows you to round up an entire 7%. It&#x27;s more near to 30% than anything.\n> \n> Again, before I get downvoted, I don&#x27;t disagree with the overall point, but I definitely disagree with how you got to it.\n> \n> This also doesn&#x27;t even take into account any other summs that the player might be going against. Barrier would eat most of this damage up, and a well timed heal (before ignite) will also eat quite a bit of it up. This post is a little too biased for my liking.\n\nUm..no? Sona has 786.5 base health at lvl 6. Where are you getting your numbers dude?\n\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Sona\n\nit's closer to 40% as I said.\n\nAnd you wrote a really big ass essay that doesn't really contribute anything. Why are we talking about resistances when ignite is true damage and electrocute scales with bonus ad pretty well and none of this even factors in minor runes and the bonus stats you get from runes. Like yes, electrocute damage does get reduced by armor and MR but does that really matter in this discussion? It's still 40% of max hp as damage with a large chunk of it being true damage.\n\nAbout defensive summoners\n\nEven if you heal before ignite, ignite does more damage. Heal into ignite is awful. Barrier is better but you trade summoners and still take damage (since barrier runs out, and even if barrier is used well it won't block more than ignite by itself). Not to mention if you take Barrier your friend Zed can go bot and kill people with ignite and your barrier is useless.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"XxDRAGONsAK47xX","date":"2018-06-25T15:59:08.584+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you should see my level 2 Anivia one shots. \n\nIgnite + Electrocute","replies":[]},{"poster":"TyroneWatermelon","date":"2018-06-26T00:39:38.320+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't forget the {{item:3146}} on apes like {{champion:55}} and{{champion:84}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ryrynounet","date":"2018-06-25T13:54:24.501+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":10,"body":">\"The problem is electrocute and ignite.\nAt lvl 6:\nIgnite does 205 damage.\nElectrocute does 110 damage.\n\nThat’s 315 damage, nearly 40% of a champion’s max hp at lvl 6.\n\nHow is this shit allowed? 40% of my hp gone to things that aren’t even enemy champion abilities.\n\nI should make a thread about this.\"\n\nBut you man, you, where's your summoner's spell ? you can take barrier or heal y'a know ? it's easy to say BROOOOKEN when you don't take into account your own summoner's spells and masteries","replies":[{"poster":"FireDrizzle","date":"2018-06-25T14:16:32.094+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sir Ryvals,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=orkk0q41,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-06-25T13:54:24.501+0000)\n> But you man, you, where&#x27;s your summoner&#x27;s spell ? you can take barrier or heal y&#x27;a know ? it&#x27;s easy to say BROOOOKEN when you don&#x27;t take into account your own summoner&#x27;s spells and masteries\n\nHaving heal vs ignite is a bad disadvantage, you want to use heal when you are low but if you use it when ignited it is obviously effected by the grievous wounds and will heal a lot less than ignite deals as damage.\n\n'\n\nIgnite is bs atm, it just takes nothing to be 1 shot.","replies":[{"poster":"Ryrynounet","date":"2018-06-25T17:09:17.529+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":">you can take barrier or heal y'a know\n\nThe cycle of life continue, we say thing, they take only what they want and hide the other things","replies":[{"poster":"Rìveń","date":"2018-06-26T04:00:42.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You never took into the account that OP may be speaking for both sides?\n\nIt's a problem and it's BS even if both sides can do it. 40% of your HP from a summoner + rune is simply not acceptable, at all.
