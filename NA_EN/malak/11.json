I&#039;m thinking stuff like Karthus and Swain right now.\n\nHere is my suggestion for it:\n\n**Dealing damage to champions with abilities grants mana. Once XXX mana has been gained from a champion this way in a short amount of time, the champion becomes Drained for X seconds, losing 10% of their Magic Resist and refreshing on further ability damage. Gain XX AP per champion that is Drained.**\n\nSo it&#039;s really really good if you get 3-5 champions in your sustained aoe damage, but meh otherwise. Unlike Conqueror, you don&#039;t get the full effects in a 1v1 nor true damage, and takes time to charge up on each champion (again, unlike conqueror). Not super useful in laning phase though...at least compared to other keystones.\n\nI think it could be a good keystone for the game\n\n**EDIT**: changed the sustain to mana gain (doesn't do a whole lot but it helps and keeps it in line with the soul draining theme)\n\nAlso, it works a bit like press the attack, in that once the rune places the debuff it doesn't do any more damage nor grant more mana.\n\nhttps://media.lolusercontent.com/api/embedly/1/image/resize?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.ibb.co%2FeO0Ufe%2FSoul_Drain.png&key=f0abbd34f14549f3a15cd94dd9970851&width=150","replies":[{"poster":"OHminus","date":"2018-08-06T17:20:11.648+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remove the healing\n\n{{champion:69}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:8}}","replies":[{"poster":"Malak","date":"2018-08-06T18:59:53.866+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=OHminus,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WtwHdT8e,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-08-06T17:20:11.648+0000)\n>\n> Remove the healing\n> \n> {{champion:69}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:8}}\n\ndone","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DW Diana","date":"2018-08-06T16:11:51.058+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":5,"body":"Would love to see this in game, sadly I just don't see it happening.
