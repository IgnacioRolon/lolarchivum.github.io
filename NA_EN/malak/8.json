If autos alone made his kit broken, add in LB enchansed autos as well as a completely solid slot item for Ap, Manna, Cdr, MS. All stats karthus only benefits positively from, would be strong. I don't see how that's in question.\n\nIf your argument is riot keeps karth autos terrible because 100% unaided by items his Autos being good would break him, how the hell is an item that's passive makes autos better not a benefit? Man its around80%+ gold effenciy on just its base stats all of which are good on karthus. Throw in basically 100% up time on passive adding  an extra 75% base damage to autos with an additional 0.5 Ap scaling?  \n\nSo like.... You want to say Riot keeps his autos trash to balance his kit? Your not wrong, I have to admit that I agree.  But man,Next up why don't you show me 1 item that his kit uses better then {{item:3100}}  if we assume his auto range and animation become good?
