Mages lose trades and all-ins, and assassins often have enough mobility to escape ganks.  All the mage can do is farm and hope to poke.\n\nIt’s just not fun to lane against assassins, and once they have their Duskblade, Gunblade, or Lichbane, you just have to not be around them anymore for the rest of the game.  Note, it’s not fun to play as them in late-game teamfights, either, but that only proves my point about unhealthy gameplay.  They have to fall-off late not to be overpowered.\n\nRecently, shorter game times have made that trade-off worth it.

Does Xerath not bully people out of lane by poking them, ziggs even? Then there is examples of quinn and kayle who abuse melee opponents in the top lane, or examples like Draven and Lucian abusing people who have weaker early game dmg compared to them. There are examples of this in other lanes, assassins have the jungle and the midlane. They do essentially what kayle, quinn, darius, lucian, and Draven do. Why is it that you are not complain about them.\n\nIt is because you dont play against them so you do seem them to be unhealthy, you only choice whats unhealthy when its inconvenient for your playstyle.
