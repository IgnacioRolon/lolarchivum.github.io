If it hits an enemy champion, heal yourself and the nearest ally and cooldown is reset. \r\n\r\nW: Dash forward, then do True Healing to allies at your location. True Healing cannot be reduced by GW.\r\n\r\nE: Throw a magic zone that silences enemies inside it. While Soraka is inside the zone, she can reactivate the ability to become untargetable and dash in any direction on a short cooldown.\r\n\r\nR: Do True Damage to all enemy champions, then True Healing to all allied champions. Also dash forward. Reactivate the ability to dash 3 more times in quick succession. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#039;m just messing around, don&#039;t take this as a hate post.","replies":[]}
