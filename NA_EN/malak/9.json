I don't know if its warranted but if Riot says so, that means their data aligns.\n\nGood riddance, Leblanc and Irelia.\n\nI imagine a lot of people are going to be happy to see that champ list. I see a whine thread daily for each of them. Jax, Akali and LeBlanc in particular.\n\n\nI do think they should reduce the gold from gold plating down to like 120, but oh well.","replies":[{"poster":"Fízz v2","date":"2018-11-27T06:23:19.603+0000","up_votes":46,"down_votes":3,"body":"Cant wait for lb mains to complain about nerfs because apparently they cant play her and think she is weak lel","replies":[{"poster":"Malak","date":"2018-11-27T06:41:49.798+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fízz v2,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WbpEfUMs,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-11-27T06:23:19.603+0000)\n>\n> Cant wait for lb mains to complain about nerfs because apparently they cant play her and think she is weak lel\n\n> [{quoted}](name=TheProfezzor,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WbpEfUMs,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-11-27T05:58:25.715+0000)\n>\n> Guess I won’t buy coven LB :/\n\nlol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fisher No Chains","date":"2018-11-27T13:22:20.763+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"2 people on r/LBMains aren’t “LeBlanc mains”, actually most of us know that the champ is busted and a nerf is warranted.\n\nWhat we’d like to see is the right nerf though, like reverting the unnecessary buff to W cd and/or nerf the chain length.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wizard Blaze","date":"2018-11-27T07:59:23.464+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":1,"body":"is it going to be another 5ms nerf for irelia?","replies":[{"poster":"The Anivia OTP","date":"2018-11-27T15:15:28.592+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"with enough nerfs, it will become a 0 mS champ and be finally balanced, cannot move off the base without tp and flash :D","replies":[{"poster":"Iota Theta","date":"2018-11-27T17:44:41.533+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Q can now be cast on allied champions and minions and grants a shield that scales with AD, .1s CD.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2018-11-27T21:50:35.301+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Irelia player comes back to game out of bathroom, game having loaded in before hand, other allies already in their lanes.*\n\n\"Guys i just need to get to the minions ; ;\"","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ØrnnToGetTrolleÐ","date":"2018-11-27T10:29:02.879+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cant wait for -5ms on jax :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2018-11-27T13:16:29.831+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":16,"body":"Aatrox still not performing well in soloQ but still getting nerfed again. Interesting. Ofc there is no lucian on the list why would we nerf adcs with 54-57% winrate from master to diamond with a 40% pickrate who riot forcefully buffed into this bullshit state when we can nerf an irrelevant bruiser who happens to be good in pro play. \n\nCamille nerfed again. It's not enough to remove her from toplane nah we just gonna kill her. Play your fuckin darius already so viktor, liss, kennen can destroy you. How dare u want a champion being able to deal with this. \nCan riot just powershift camille back into toplane? Camille jungle: cancer with no counterplay.  Camille toplane: lots of counterplay and shitty matchups. \nGive her back her MASSIVELY nerfed E dmg and just tack \"deals 50% less dmg to monsters\" on every fuckin spell don't care at this point anymore. Just wanna play her toplane without having to play her as second jungle. \n\nJax nerf is a joke. Put simply. but he is not lucian so we gonna nerf him anyways. \n\nLike people talking about how shit adc is yeah i mean lucian surpresses the entire line up like always when he is good but whatever. Riot balance they are paid professionals they know what they do. \n\nIrelia doesn't need simple straight nerfs irelia needs a rework/powershift. Riot fucked her up with her passive trying to bring her into toplane and instead made her dominate mid AND top. \n\nEither she is a sustained dmg threat with her passive or a bursty assassin diver but not BOTH.","replies":[{"poster":"Jerry SeinfeId","date":"2018-11-27T16:20:19.691+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Camille nerfed again.

In fact, an E buff would actually do the exact opposite of what you want because it would make her an even better ganker.\n\nAt this rate, I think they need to do some heavy power shuffling on Camille's abilities to get her back in lane. That probably should involve scaling E2 distance to hit her early ganking along with more competitive Q and W ranks. Something has to give on that E distance if we ever expect her to not auto-lose every stat check in top lane.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"vgamedude","date":"2018-11-27T06:50:43.759+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":"Still nothing for lucian lmao\n\nclassic rito","replies":[{"poster":"I lit your baby","date":"2018-11-27T22:15:54.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=vgamedude,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WbpEfUMs,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-11-27T06:50:43.759+0000)\n>\n> Still nothing for lucian lmao\n> \n> classic rito\n\nhe's shit.","replies":[{"poster":"vgamedude","date":"2018-11-27T23:08:11.494+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=temp324,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WbpEfUMs,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2018-11-27T22:15:54.251+0000)\n>\n> he&#x27;s shit.\n\n13 - 14 percent pick rate and nearly 52 percent winrate.
