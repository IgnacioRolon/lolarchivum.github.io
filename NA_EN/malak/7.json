How do you even dodge that ult anyways? Specially as an immobile mage like Karthus.\n\nSame with Zed, Talon (and btw I play talon a lot), Kassadin, Leblanc.\n\nMy last game last night, I played versus a Fizz who I could tell was significantly lower skilled than me. At lvl 1, I brought him down to 10% hp with poke and I had a CS lead. Soon as he hit 6, I couldn&#039;t be in the same lane as the guy anymore. \n\nI still won the game but damn...how is that fun? What makes you think I want to interact with my enemy laner when the only possible outcome is that I feed? What I got going for me is waveclear and late game scaling, so of course I just want to push and roam (or freeze).\n\nSo the mage mana nerf is pretty unnecessary and frankly BS.","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-11-12T21:26:42.309+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So Fizz is one of those champions like Leblanc that is hell for mid laners especially if you are immobile and lack hard CC. Even my OTP champ (Ekko) gets 100 to 0 against fizz when he hits 6 before me. Usually because he can Q me and if I try to retaliate He will E and I cannot even get my passive off and will have to back before him. then when he hits 6 so easy to ult me while I do not have mine and it is an instant kill even if I am under tower which is so frustrating. This champ really is no fun to play against and once he is fed he does not need his ult to kill you which is very frustrating as it is hard to hit him or luck him down.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Strawberrycocoa","date":"2018-11-12T21:23:19.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Always good to meet another Karthus fan.

And his Q has a pretty high cost for a spammed ability, so wasting all your mana getting him low was a bad idea.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2018-11-12T21:14:36.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Exhaust cuts that damage by alot","replies":[]}]}
