Heck, playing more than 2 roles is a handicap since you split your time between them all. No matter the case, autofilled players deserve to be compensated rightfully for being put in a tough situation and not dodging.\n\nAnother thing, I just got autofilled support and won. I was thinking maybe I did better than the enemy autofill but NOPE enemy team had no autofill based on their match histories and the champions they played. \n\nWhich makes me wonder if the **entire team with the autofilled player should receive +5 lp**. Because it&#039;s like basically going vs a team with higher mmr.","replies":[{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2018-08-11T21:57:05.717+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"right because i need people INTENTIONALLY picking a role they cant play...","replies":[{"poster":"Malak","date":"2018-08-11T22:00:01.232+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SwiftKitten88,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EhJM4bi2,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-08-11T21:57:05.717+0000)\n>\n> right because i need people INTENTIONALLY picking a role they cant play...\n\n??? you can't choose to be autofilled.

What would be the point of autofilling you in mid lane for instance when there are still no supports playing? how would that help the queue times get lowered? autofill is supposed to help lower queue times not be a meaningless addition.\n\nFor instance, if you have 20 people in queue and those 20 are queuing as follows: 10 mid, 4 ADC, 2 jungler, 3 top, 1 support. What sense would it make to have the jungler or support be autofilled to mid? why not have some of those mid be autofilled to the other roles so that queue times actually are shorter instead of randomly longer because \"everybody has to get their healthy dose of playing the other roles\"","replies":[{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2018-08-12T01:02:07.532+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even before role selection, queue times were naturally lower because you didn't have that same scenario, you went in without a preference. \n\nMy point is pick your poison, a world where there is no role selection and somebody had to \"fill\" every game, or a world where you get autofilled once every so many games and have a significantly increased chance of getting your role. \n\nI ain't bitching about autofill because I was around when we didn't need it, things were worse, the community just hasn't adapted kindly to it/weren't around before to understand the pros vs. cons of our new system. Either players need to get used to it, or league needs to revert back to the time when players actually did have to know multiple roles. The OP is asking for rewards playing with/as an auto filled player when everybody except first pick was fill originally. \n\nI just didn't like that autofill was primary forcing support at the time, and unlike previously where last pick was support so you had to learn support, autofill kinda catches players on their toes occasionally but not urgently enough for them to actually know how to support. That wasn't so much a system issue, just a general issue with that system for this game in general due to lack of support players comparably.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shobek","date":"2018-08-12T00:47:31.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pick priority was better","replies":[]}]}]}
