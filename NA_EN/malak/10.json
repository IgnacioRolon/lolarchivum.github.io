For instance, while mana burn is probably a shit idea, energy burn will be an ok idea to implement, because of the high rate of resource recovery for energy users.","replies":[{"poster":"kile147","date":"2018-05-14T14:29:05.070+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Silence is a healthier version of Mana burn.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"My Waifu Vanilla","date":"2018-05-13T20:54:37.994+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Having your stats stolen isn't fun in any game especially if it is \"long lasting\".

Whats the first reaction to a diana coming in on you? Flash out of her E range. Nimbus cloak prevents this.

The current 1 shot playstyle revolves around setting this up before you go in. Hob allows you to have a nashors tooth worth of attack speed to proc this with at level 1, which scales up later on. Makes your level 1 vs melee champions brutal lol. Electrocute is great early, but really unnecessary after level 8 or so (90 ap and a revolver) as you can then 1 shot people anyway, but for those that build against this, your passive tends to finish them off. Against a single target electrocute is fine, but for two or more you need your passive.\nThis is another reason why a lot of people take phase rush instead, it allows them to chase people down after the first 1 shot xD","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2018-05-13T15:55:44.183+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"the reason the runes are distributed the way they are is to encourage branching out and devising combinations with the system, as opposed to taking Sorcery/Inspiration on every AP damage dealer ever every game for example.\n\nAlso, your option is terrible. it's just \"have free damage\".","replies":[{"poster":"ninjaroxas","date":"2018-05-13T18:48:34.308+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Isn't nimbus cloak just \"have free movement speed\"?","replies":[{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2018-05-16T04:03:20.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ninjaroxas,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pYptNEFm,comment-id=00070000,timestamp=2018-05-13T18:48:34.308+0000)\n>\n> Isn&#x27;t nimbus cloak just &quot;have free movement speed&quot;?\n\nMovement speed tied to your Ult is more strategic and requires more forthought.\nA good amount of champions can't even make all that good use of it while others gan in a given scenario.\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"My Waifu Vanilla","date":"2018-05-13T20:58:09.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Movement speed is more universal.
