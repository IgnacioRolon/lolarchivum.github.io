Later i saw that Lux, Akali and Darius weren't unlocked. I think sb got into my account and sold them. Today i discovered this refund system and i wanted to refund Nidalee cause i dont want her. I went to the refund page and it says that i have wasted all my 3 refunds on Darius Lux and Akali (it wasnt me). How can i undo this ? Can i get my 3 tokens back ?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-11T00:36:40.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eek, that doesn't sound like a good way to being the new year. :(\n\nIf you submit a [**support ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), you can get in touch with one of our recovery specialists who can take a look at see what we can do.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
