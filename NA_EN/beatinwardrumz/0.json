Since then, we have had two releases - tahm, and kindred (lore release at least - check it out, a little piece was written by Riot called a good death, nice read).  Both of them are really cool conceptually, and provide enough detail for speculation unlike some other  releases(cough cough bard cough cough), HOWEVER neither of these champions seem to tie into the existing universe very well.  With the retcon, i was under the impression that Riot&#039;s goal was to be able to have plot development - thus far the only real development we have gotten has been in the bilgewater event (which was really cool), and it doesnt seem like tahm or kindred tie much into Noxus/demacia or Shuriman civil war etc etc.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2015-09-24T01:37:21.245+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"The wonderful fellow you are referencing is not the new head of lore, let's not throw a bunch of stuff on his plate! Tahm Kench and Kindred were not worked on by Graham, though you'll be seeing some more of his work soon...

We identified that there was a space there we hadn't fleshed out much, and could do some cool stuff with, as we were working on a couple of concepts that occupied somewhat similar spots. We concluded that was something to embrace, rather than a problem we needed to solve, hence three champs in quick succession with thematic overlap (internal name for a while was 'Year of the myth' as a result). \n\nHaving said that we'll generally be more concrete space for new champions for a while now. The upcoming champs we're working on still have a fairly fantastical nature to them (LoL's that sort of game), but in the more common 'lots of people know they're real and roughly where in the world they might be' sort of way.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2015-09-24T14:40:26.121+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not against mythological champions in general. My issue is that instead of getting Aatrox and Lissandra, people who are either a looming threat, or have impacted the world, we keep getting vague champions who don't interact with anyone meaningful.

From Kindred, Tahm Kench, and Aatrox, there have been quite a few champions that have legends told throughout Runeterra. Other champions, such as Amumu, Lissandra, etc., have more local lore. Is it intentional for some of these champions to be so famous across different cultures? The creatures of the Shadow Isles seem to have some infamy in Ionia, and Bilgewater. Will we see them more spread out across the world, or are they local terrors?\n\nA worry and criticism I have is that these champions are more mythological rather than movers of a story. You can't really expect Rek'Sai to ever interact with Kalista.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeatinWarDrumz","date":"2015-09-24T01:38:36.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tx for response","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AmÃ©lie Cauchemar","date":"2015-09-24T00:13:57.107+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're not supposed. \n\nThey're called outside sources. \n\nDo crossroad demons pertain to anything about your life story? 98% chance no.
