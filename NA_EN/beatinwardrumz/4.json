Look, I am a player that s very pessimistic, and I NEED to work on calling it quits early (I don't afk, but if we are down I lose morale), but there are games that are fundamentally unwinnable.  It is not less honorable to not surrender (I would rather lose on my own terms than just get fucked repeatedly in the ass by the enemy), nor does it lose you LP AFAIK.  So please, if the game has a 0.01% chance of being won and everyone wants to end, please just press yes.","replies":[{"poster":"Krigjer","date":"2015-10-10T10:13:11.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The basic point is that yes, there IS a possibility to win what seems like an impossible game.\n\nBut it's not fun to turtle for half an hour.","replies":[{"poster":"Shyvana Bot","date":"2015-10-10T10:44:13.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not when that yasuo just onset your entire team.

Long arduous games where you work together to overcome an enemy that doesn't have to try to beat you and therefore ends up not having as good player synergy all while trying to get your team to stop tearing eachother's throats out and work out their differences is the best feeling this game has to offer imo.\n\nI will surrender, but only in really bad scenarios like the OP described. If we are 7 kills, 2 turrets, 2-3 dragons down I will keep going.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"what you deserve","date":"2015-10-10T10:08:33.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've done a decent job winning games even when that far behind. When people get far enough ahead, they tend to make lots more mistakes. Surrendering will keep you from learning.\n\nThrows and comebacks are like, the biggest part of lategame. 90% of games in which one team is leading most of the time will result in a random shifting point in which you can come back. \nI once played a game in which the enemies had their 3 inhibitor turrets, and my team had no turrets. We waited until all of our inhibitors respawned (DEFENSE GAME STRONG!) and managed to ace their team. We took baron and ran straight through mid and won.","replies":[]}]}
