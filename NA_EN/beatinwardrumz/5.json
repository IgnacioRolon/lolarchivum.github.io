The fact of the matter is, he was the first designer to understand that a game with 120 champs (or however many there were around thresh/darius time), it was time for some innovation.  Did he go overboard (especially on kalista)?  Yes.  However, he has allowed other champion designers to look at his designs and think &quot;huh, maybe that will create balance problems... but let&#039;s try some innovation!&quot;  Without him, champions like bard who IMO is really cool design and is not imbalanced would not be possible.   I know, I know, we all hate kalista and it&#039;s fun to rag on him.  and hes pretty bad at balance (no offense, bro), but without him league would not be as poular nor as fun to play.  Sure, it&#039;s fun to reminisce about when every champion was simple and balancing wasnt hard, but let&#039;s be real:  do you really want a game with no fun/ unique champions even if it is better balanced?  I say no - the balance is an issue, and CT takes it too far sometimes, but he has evolved the game into something that it probably wouldn&#039;t be without his creativity and the precedents he set.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the replies!  Couple of things i want to say:\n\n#1 - I like that this is promoting healthy, non-circlejerky conversation where all posts are getting up/downvoted not like 30 with 100 upvotes and then like 2 with -20.\n\n#2 - CT is not DIRECTLY responsible for really well designed champs like bard, but he was the first one to challenge what a moba should be in terms of simplicity.","replies":[{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-10-20T11:21:56.691+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":10,"body":"I don't find his champions unique simply because he throws everything into their kits.\n\n I could make a kit twice as overloaded as Ekko's but I wouldn't ever consider it unique simply because it could only be considered that way due to it being overloaded. \n\nCertainlyT needs to know how to make a fun and unique kit with just \"Q does damage\" not \"Q gives you 30 dashes if W is off cooldown then your Q also does 14% max health damage + slows the target for 1% for every 1% health they are missing\".

He has only made 5 champions, and then had the largest hand in the Morde rework. \n\nChampions like Darius and Zyra haven't been  extremely popular until RiotRepertoir did the recent rework on Darius. Yasuo has proved difficult to balance but recent nerfs have brought him down a peg but still left him fun to play. Thresh is a strong pick as a support but I would never consider him OP or oppressive in lane. I feel that his popularity points more to a lack of innovation in support champions. We are now starting to see more unique supports being designed and I for one love it. \n\nAdditionally throwing out the words \"Broken\" and \"Toxic\" paint a really bad picture but do nothing to provide and accurate description of the champion. In the same way that listing only a champions strengths would make any champion appear to be OP. \n\nAnd then we have Kalista. In my opinion if she is so popular then the balance team needs to adjust the numbers a little bit more to make her pay for her strengths. I don't see the hop as a broken mechanic. It forces players to change they way they play, even the champions they play, and adds and element to the champion that has never been seen before. Is she actually broken or toxic? I honestly think she is just a little over tuned with a play style that people still aren't use to.\n\nI honestly didn't like the Morde rework but from the looks of it he will be headed for a much bigger rework so I am not really concerned about it. I do think he messed up with that one though. And as for his communication, sure its nowhere near RiotRepertoir but I am not sure it is fair to judge him based on that. \n\nAt the end of the day i am not defending him because he is my favorite designer or his champions are the only ones I play. I simply don't think that he deserves all the criticism that he gets and especially in the manner that it is given. He is one of many designers that are working to make unique and entertaining champions for league.

You say that Kalista is immune to melee champs and Yasuo destroys skill shot champs as if it will always be a predetermined outcome.

He doesn't even have anything to do with the balance team and he only balances a champion for the first weeks - then the Balance team takes over.

Poppy/old Morde were UP all this time not because they are such a great example for balance but rather because their kits suck so hard that they can't be allowed to be viable.

I'd consider most of his champions quite the success, even though I don't play them (except for Yasuo at times).\n\nAnd also I do like how he interacts with the community.

And she's very well designed.  You know why?  Her early game is _genuine trash_ unlike the modern, hyper-scaling champs with designer-proclaimed \"weak\" early games like Jinx and Vayne, whose early game is anything but weak yet they still scale out of control.\n\nAnd when it comes to CertainlyToxic, his champs are strong at every stage of the game _and_ scale extremely well.

It also limits her dashing over walls which is also pretty huge. And her being a highly contested pick is not part of her kit - her very limited damage to towers due to the 0.9 ratio on the other hand is..\nIf she misuses her rend she actually loses a lot of damage which is a problem other ADCs don't have.
