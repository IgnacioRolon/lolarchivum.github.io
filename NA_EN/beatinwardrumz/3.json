We've seen much more dedication from EU players than NA players. I compare players from say, TSM or Liquid, with their girlfriends around rather often, sometimes on camera (less so TSM recently. Good job Regi on that one). Look at saaaay, the old Gambit/M5, with one of their players who had a wife and kid, and was dedicated to the team enough to leave them sometimes when needed, etc. They were also one of the better EU teams for a year or two because of that. When they started getting complacent and lazy, look at the state they are in now.\n\nIt is about dedication, and NA doesn't have it, because they aren't put into a position to need it. Here, players are thrown parties, made a big deal of (see Dyrus and all the fanfare over him retiring, compared to none for many other players in other regions who were MUCH better players retiring recently with no word at all), celebrating our domestic victories over so much in so many cases. EU had that same problem this year unfortunately, but for better reason with Fnatic at least, but they've done the same in the past. \n\nwhen EU and NA start realizing domestic means dick compared to the international stuff, they will improve.

Just like focusing on their studies, they are used to spending every waking hour improving in one aspect.\n\nQuite frankly put, Korean teams invest a lot more time practicing, and their success isn't exclusive to their culture.\nLook at Fnatic or AHQ for example. They have shown themselves capable of competing against Korean teams without being predominately Korean.\n\nNA will start winning too when they also find the same dedication for League of Legends.","replies":[]},{"poster":"evil magic","date":"2015-10-12T19:22:42.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you also left out the part where faker was like 12 when he became a professional gamer. half of the people from NA are 16+ when they start, and some are like 30 something neckbeard losers (like me).\n\nthey literally only know league of legends. zero real life experience outside of gaming.","replies":[]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2015-10-12T18:40:21.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I assumed it's because in America they make money off of just being the team whereas in Korea they get more money from sponsorship.

This is mostly because it has the liberty/luxury of being able to sustain that sort of society due to its economy. So much in NA revolves around service instead of production. If you have an idea, and you know how to sell it, people will buy, because they have more money to \"throw around\". \n\nNA companies acquire the most foreign players as well, and those players agree to move. Why do you think that is? It's not about culture, it's not about magic, and it's not about genes. It's about discipline and motivation. The competition in Asia is far greater than the competition in North America. If Doublelift under-performs, what will the team do about it? Replace him? With who? NA doesn't natively produce great players one after the other. In contrast, if a player under-performs in Asia, there are many others who can replace him. \n\nAt that point, you can argue your point - that the lack of motivation stems from e-sports' perception -  but it'd still be a weak argument. Players in NA are happy with just being able to \"game for a living\". The ambition of becoming champions is lesser here than in Asia because you'll still have fans, and you'll still have your contract. All you need to do is create a persona which people love. Even if you're a terrible player, if people like you enough, you're fine.     \n\nTL;DR - It's not about magic, genes, or culture. It's about complacence which stems from a lack of discipline and motivation.","replies":[]}]}
