Demacians will first grab the potential criminal (if possible), then interrogate, then judge then punish. They are white to this point they don't even fight actively for any resources/lands/technology. No real evidence of signs of politics corruption (outside of Noxus influence but then - black-white interaction). It's kinda sickening me.\n\nI'm not saying this stuff above should be removed because it can be worked around while leaving the \"white\" part intact. That's why to balance things they NEED type of character who will make them way less white. The character what should make u question \"why would I even want to live here?\". Champion whom action definitely won't be the brightest (from modern moral standpoint) but would have permission to be enough autonomic from the government itself (J4 and stuff). I'm not saying it should be chaotic character (because it wouldn't fit in Demacia at all) but definitely shouldn't be good (again, by modern moral standpoint - here in Demacia he could be even a hero).\n\nThat's why I dropped idea above. Inquisitor. Cold, reserved, relentless. You know what type - \"Is there even a hint of possible worship of forbidden gods in this town? burn it down.\" And people would be glad because corruption was purged from their nation. Garen is not so autonomic to give such drastic orders and even then he is protector of \"those who cannot fight\".

Draven does not kill for fun he enjoys the attention that he gets when people watch him execute and Darius does what he does for Noxus and i have never seen any enjoyment in it. Vlad is loosely related to Noxus but also with another outside organization same with Le Blanc though less out side and more of a secret organization. but despite their personality quirks Draven Darius Swain and  Sion perform their duties in service to their city state same with Katarina Cassiopia and Talon although firstly to the Du Couteau House Hold who has the best Interest of Noxus in mind as far as is shown","replies":[{"poster":"Xulsigae","date":"2015-09-28T08:31:17.265+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't killing for attention akin to killing for fun?

While Demacia has it's bad sides, there are a lot of good people that are mentioned in the lore, like even Jarvan was willing to accept Shyvanna.  When it comes to Morg vs Kayle, it's pretty black and white. What we know is that Kayle fights for peace while Morgana fights for freedom that the others are blocking. If we look at Kayle's quotes and we look at Morgana's wings and such, we can see that Kayle's cause is one that has a lot of tolls, while we know nothing of Morgana's and what evil they do.","replies":[{"poster":"Gorgannan","date":"2015-09-29T00:48:09.891+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not about how they're portrayed.

If i'm not the .0001% of the most powerful, I'll get fucked in Noxus. Yeah Demacia is all about powerful families, but those people take the bullet to do their job and protect the weak. \n\nAlso Quinn seemed to do fine as a hillbilly because she had skills.
