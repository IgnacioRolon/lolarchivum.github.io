People will say hurr durr they impact balance, but it would be VERY small.  As long as it matters a teensy bit, I think Iit would be cool.  For example, if Lucian is against a shadow isles character and he kills them X amount of times, he gets a bonus 200 gold.  ATM because they are sooo focused on balance, the only quests are super small (like zilean gets 10 extra gold from killing volibear, or the khazix rengar thing).  Honestly, there are only two reasons NOT to do this\r\n\r\n1 - Riot is lazy and doesnt want to take like a day to code this in (no new animations or kit changes, just some bonus golds or stats and maybe a quote, for big rialries like lucian and thresh and sion jarvan put a little extra effort)\r\n\r\n2 -  they are SO concerned about balance that they wont even make small changes\r\n\r\nOff the top of my head, I can list (and vice versa):\r\n\r\nKass vs void champs\r\n\r\nSion vs jarvan or Galio\r\n\r\nGaren vs kat\r\n\r\nDarius and draven get a small bonus from being on the same team and assiting each other\r\n\r\nZed and syndra vs kennen, shen, and akali\r\n\r\nSej, voli, udyr vs Ashe trynd and braum vs liss and trundle\r\n\r\nTrynd vs aatrox\r\n\r\nlucian vs SI champions\r\n\r\netc etc etc\r\n\r\nUpvote if you think this is a good idea, maybe a Rioter will see this (Bio im counting on you!)","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-09-05T20:46:16.518+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"You rang?\n\nI think there's been a few things that sort of touch on this, referred to as hidden passives:\n\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Easter_eggs/Hidden_Passive\n\nIn that list you'll find little treats for Vi/Caitlyn vs. Jinx, Leona vs. sunglasses, pirates vs. ninjas, etc.  These are super subtle things that might add 1g or -1hp or something of that scale - nothing particularly game-breaking for the most part.  I don't know what the development cost is for making (and more importantly - maintaining) these things are, so I can't speak to if they are easy to add, or more trouble than they've been worth.  I see that they removed the item for Rengar (in the Kha'Zix/Rengar quest) and turned it into a passive stacking buff instead.\n\nI agree with TurquoiseYoshi and ChromaticEagle that 200g is a hefty chunk of change that could change the course of a game, if it came at the right moment.  The number of times I've been short even 50g to get my next item I can hardly count!\n\nI think the kind of effort that's going into these things is usually channeled into the taunt quotes (which have been pretty extensive, recently, I thought).  \n\nWhat I _wouldn't_ want to see is more reasons for players to fight for results that don't align with the rest of their team.  You sometimes see this in events - if you've got half your team wanting to kill more turrets, and another team wants to win fast, then you get players who are misaligned in their goals, and that can lead to intra-team conflict.  Maybe you argue that 200g isn't enough to create that sort of conflict - but I've seen how even in normal games, an upset player can begrudge a jungler some CS, or a player in a vs. bots game might be disappointed that they didn't practice a baron kill before ending the game.  I could only imagine the anger _some_ players would display if they were playing Lucian and the jungler killed the enemy Thresh.  Or how annoyed the rest of the team might get if Lucian, determined to get that gold, took a risk that they maybe shouldn't have done.  :(\n\nI could see something like these things turn up as hidden passives in the future (if it's not a maintenance nightmare - I don't know) or as something that could turn up in a future event, or more likely be something we see a lot of in taunts between champs.","replies":[{"poster":"NullDragon","date":"2015-09-05T22:14:41.921+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like featured gamemodes tied to lore, like Black Market Brawlers and the differently themed ARAM.

In that context, would you consider tying more seasonal game modes to lore (the Harrowing seems like it'll be one such case)? Those instances don't have to be as vast as the Bilgewater update, but could offer smaller opportunities to flesh out characters and relationships that would probably not be worth creating an entire major lore event around. If by any chance a temporary game mode like Find the {{champion:17}} gets released, for example, that could be a good opportunity to flesh out Teemo a bit more and mention how other characters in the game view him, without necessarily making it a Bandle City update (though that could be a golden opportunity, too).\n\nOn that note, how busy/productive is Rito's lore team right now? It's obvious they've leveled up a ton over the past few years, but so far we've only gotten lore through either champion releases/overhauls or massive dedicated lore events. Are there any plans to release some lore in smaller parcels, and how much more work would that demand of the Rioters working on lore?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Balmor0","date":"2015-09-07T19:20:07.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aatrox when are you going to chance him like for real.

This results either in no one ever hearing the VOs, or that champion getting half of their health chunked off by the enemy they're _supposed_ to be mocking. Really it should be something that happens at a more appropriate time and by itself, like when landing the killing blow on them.\n\nThe other problem is that due to the rather slow speed that VOs come out, most of the interaction comes off as incredibly one sided and less interactive. This is especially true as more and more visual reworks don't come with a new VO and the champion is stuck saying the same six or seven things they always have _coughmorganaalistar_. I'd love to hear what some of the champions think of Tahm's less than savoury comments about them, but in most cases that's almost certainly not coming any time soon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jingerbeardman","date":"2015-09-06T01:49:19.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taunts are fun and all... but they are not very interactive.

BTW thank you for commenting on my post :).  The thing is, I dislike the fact that these passives are hidden and arent displayed in any kind of \"epic way\".  The taunts are really cool (when i browse lol wiki I think that you have done a great job with dunkmaster darius, tahm kench, etc etc), but I have a hard time getting them to trigger - for example, i was playing as sion against urgot and I couldn't get that taunt to trigger despite the fact that i taunted right at him from like 2 feet away (maybe 300 units).  Also, most players just spam taunt anyway.  \n\nTL;DR - these quests should be more apparent, easier to trigger, and have (slightly) bigger effects.  Plus, I think it would be cool to have these things impact the game - for example, intentionally setting up your Lucian  to kill thresh instead of just being passive bonus.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-09-05T19:31:28.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be a cool idea, but making there be large gold amounts wouldn't be good.
