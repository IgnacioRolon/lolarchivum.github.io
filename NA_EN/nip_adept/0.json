It's likely, though, that you've already received a chest for Annie in the past.  You can only get one chest for a champion per season.  More info is also available at our [hextech crafting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide) guide.

The golden border around the champion profile signifies that a mastery for it was already earned.

Looking into this, you were out of mastery chest drops for the week you played Dr. Mundo.  You can check the chest icons on your profile tab which will indicate how many mastery chests you can receive until the next refresh.  Best of luck!","replies":[{"poster":"NiP Adept","date":"2016-09-17T06:18:12.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But all 4 chests are silver colour , not gold , how can i be out of them if i didnt get any in this week friend?

So if all 4 chests are silver, that means you have no chest slots available.\n\nThis can be very confusing, especially since looking at the champions tab, it's the exact opposite.","replies":[{"poster":"NiP Adept","date":"2016-09-17T07:00:56.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so i cant earn chest because i need to wait basicly? but i didnt get any chest in 2 weeks lol cant understand how  this system works","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
