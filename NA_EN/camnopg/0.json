It would highlight the experimentation aspect of ARAM and make it more fun, taking your chances and possibly landing a champion you've never played before, or maybe just receiving a champ you owned. This would allow players to experiment more.\nEDIT: Edited to clarify/explain more in depth","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-07-27T07:59:14.204+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":2,"body":"Im just here to see all the people who build aram specific accounts get mad {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[{"poster":"cocacolalips","date":"2017-07-27T19:36:06.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you realise all those aram accounts with udyr are really unfun to play against right? they are all bears and they run at you super fast to slap you in the face, that's just rude and you can't even slap them back without having a PETA's lawsuit up your butt, that's so unfair!
