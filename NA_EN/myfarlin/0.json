This is just ridiculous!","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":1,"down_votes":13,"body":"Absolutely absurd, you play 100+ games, then have one game where you react to someone griefing you and instantly get chat restricted, lose honor, and lose chests and keys. Just so unfair and such a poorly designed system designed to coddle the sensitive SJWs that play this game.\r\n\r\nHere is the logs:\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nMyfarlin: can u watch or ward my red\r\nMyfarlin: hello\r\nMyfarlin: am i getting griefed\r\nMyfarlin: you got pings muted buddy?\r\nMyfarlin: hardstuck been reading reddit say to mute all?\r\nMyfarlin: there you go\r\nMyfarlin: i int your lane now\r\nMyfarlin: doesnt ward my buff, doesnt help, just afk in alne\r\nMyfarlin: no map awareness\r\nMyfarlin: please go afk bro\r\nMyfarlin: we carry 4v5\r\nMyfarlin: gl withyour climb this seaso nshen\r\nMyfarlin: enjoy free win, not playing with full mute griefers like shen\r\nMyfarlin: is everyone muted or just me\r\nMyfarlin: i dont give a fk lol\r\nMyfarlin: as you can see im getting griefed by my top laner\r\nMyfarlin: hey guys i read on reddit to full mute all, it helps me with climb, im hardstuck silver 2 seasons Xd\r\nMyfarlin: my jungler ask for ward, but it is more important that i sit under tower XD\r\nMyfarlin: why are we not open btw\r\nPost-Game\r\nMyfarlin: this jungler just too good\r\nMyfarlin: randomly walks up to red at 4 min\r\nMyfarlin: on the 1% chacne that I do a full clear and my top is afk\r\nMyfarlin: im inting your game if you full mute all\r\nMyfarlin: quit being a cuck, if you dont respond to my pings im inting your lane lol\r\nMyfarlin: if you cant ward my buff and sit under turret\r\nMyfarlin: im inting you dumbfuck tard\r\nMyfarlin: gl with your climb reddit %%%\r\nMyfarlin: yeah he just grief me\r\nMyfarlin: i can lose at 15 or 30\r\nMyfarlin: no point wasting time\r\n\r\nAs you can see, it is very mild and simply a normal reaction to a troll who is looking for a reaction. I guess I shouldn't feed the troll so to speak, but he is LITERALLY GRIEFING MY GAME. I am stuck here with him and lose my game as a result of my griefing, and then I get punished to boot?
