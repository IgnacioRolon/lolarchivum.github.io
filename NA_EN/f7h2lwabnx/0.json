If you examine the art creatively, wolf is wearing the lamb mask and lamb is wearing the wolf mask.  So, wolf x lamb? But I&#039;m pretty sure lamb is a young boy.  Eww.

I remember either Jaredan or Ant in Oz saying that Lamb knows all but feels nothing (Omniscient), where as Wolf feels all and knows nothing (Omnipathetic). Which would mean that wolf feels every emotion including love and lust. That would mean that he could feel the same feelings as a homosexual at least. However, although he feels those emotions, I don't think those emotions are his, so I would say he's gay or straight or anything for that matter.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2015-11-04T02:40:40.477+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wow maybe read the lore and understand what you are drawing.
