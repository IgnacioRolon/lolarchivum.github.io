However, since Poppy's rework needs to finish before work can begin on the other champions that needs similar level reworks (Urgot, Yorick), just how long are we expected to wait for ChampUp to \"get things right\" with everyone?\n\nIf Poppy is still \"quite a long way off,\" what does that mean for fans of Yorick and Urgot?  We've **already waited more than 4 years** for a new Yorick skin, or any significant development with the champ from Riot.  Are we going to have to wait another **two to three years** before Riot gets around to doing something about Yorick, a champion the company acknowledges needs some major love?","replies":[]},{"poster":"ExecutorDill","date":"2015-07-18T18:48:53.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like Shen perhaps? :]\n\nLCS needs their tanky ninja to perform!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Serge THE GREAT","date":"2015-07-18T13:51:28.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=69fyI52O,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-07-18T07:59:02.881+0000)\n>\n> Still a Yordle sized Yordle that smacks people much bigger than herself around.

Shouldn't that mean that she's next in line?\n\nI know that the rework departments are wacky at Riot and constantly fluctuating, but why bother just listing Poppy then?  If you are saying right here, right now, that a slew of other reworks are going to be released before her, then the Rework page should reflect that.  You should be showing Taric, and Evelynn and all the other champions that are undergoing reworks.","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-07-18T17:25:15.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AFAIK champion reworks don't occur linearly; it's not quite an assembly line. (Note: The following is all hypothetical) Her gameplay might be good to go but her visuals are still being worked on, or visuals might be done but her lore/launch materials (ie. any videos, reveals, teasers) might not be finished, or any combination of all the factors that go into creating a champion. In addition, if gameplay is done with Poppy, and say, Ashe just needs a gameplay touch up, they can work on her and release her as soon as she finishes, since she didn't need (much) visual work or (any) lore, etc.\n\nI *think* the reason they listed her was because she's (or at least was at the time) the next major focus as far as champion relaunches. I wouldn't be surprised if they did away with the reworks page though, just because things seem to fluctuate a lot (apparently Fiora's rework is up again?)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ramuhdo","date":"2015-07-18T14:54:38.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But her rework was announced 8 months ago.
