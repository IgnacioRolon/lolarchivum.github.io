I've been somewhat silent long enough. Why is it that champions like yasuo akali amd irelia or zed get TWO SKINS WITHIN THE SPAN OF A YEAR but champions like my #1 main ANIVIA might get ONE EVERY 2 FUCKING YEAR'S? Go to her page and look up when each of her skins have been released and I bet you'll see a 2 year gap between each after her release skin. Rek'Sai had only had eternum and pool party ever since 2015 and kindred in the same boat with super galaxy and shadowfire. Kled also! Literally got his second fucking skin since RELEASE BACK IN 2015 just last year..... (Which I was happy for but still would like dragon trainer kled more...) Now champions who I main like kat and poppy and xayah are fine because they have a lot of skins to which most of them I don't really Like so it's ok, and xayah's getting a legendary in a couple days to which I like all her skins except dusk so it's also fine, but I'm seriously getting annoyed by the champions who get ignored because they're not as popular as the 4 Ionian douchebags, that end up getting nerfed more than that one kid who brought a nerf pistol to a nerf gun fight and thought he'd be fine with just that alone! Kai'Sa is included too! (But I like Kai'Sa so I just ignore it.) I would understand if choosing a skin and who to give it to was hard but I mean, I doubt it's that hard, especially when your giving them every month. (Or patch) phew, I feel a little better now.... But seriously, give rek and kindred a skin Already, I know their not as popular as most junglers but come on. (And I still want dragon trainer kled....)","replies":[]}
