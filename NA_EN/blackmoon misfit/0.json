Basically, I'm a major crybaby, and people being mean to me sucks. One of my New Years resolutions though was to suck it up and play at least one Normal game a day if I can, just to get better. I missed a few days already, since I had a couple of bad games, and my morale's starting to dip a bit. Being level 30 with only 28 normal wins doesn't look good on your League \"resume\", and just like before, people seem to have no problems reminding you how much you suck. It sucks even more when I've been trying to be nothing but nice and friendly in every game, making jokes, complimenting people and having fun, even with the people on the other team. Sometimes, people reciprocate and we all have fun. Most times though, that... really doesn't happen. Like this last game, this poor Jinx (me) is going 6/12/5, she sucks, and she *knows* she sucks. Do people have to rub it in? Likewise, there's just something about saying \"glhf\" at the start of a game and hearing \"eat a dick %%%%%%\" in response that makes me wonder why I even bother.\r\n\r\nThen I got a free skin.\r\n\r\nBefore this, I only had one skin, and that was Officer Vi. A friend gifted it to me during the skin's initial release because he knew that she was one of my favorite champions. For the longest time, I wanted Officer Caitlyn, just to complete the set. The Piltover pair are my most favorite characters in the game, and having matching skins for both would've been all I've ever really wanted out of this game. A different friend told me that Riot was giving out free mystery skins for good behavior (since I hadn't seen the announcement), and I wondered if I was good enough to get one. I tried so hard to be nice during all these games, even in the ones where people were being mean to each other and to me, so I should get one too, right? Days passed, and I heard all my friends talk about the skins they got, like Runeguard Volibear and Prestigious LeBlanc, but I didn't see anything. I logged in tonight one last time before going to bed to see if I got anything, and lo and behold, I did. I got a mystery skin, and it turned out to be exactly the skin I wanted. What are the odds? Was this a karmic reward for how much I actively tried to be nice, friendly, and sportsmanlike in game? Was this Riot's way of trying to lift my spirits, to tell me that no matter what people say, I did nothing wrong just by trying to play the game to the best of my meager ability? I could've gotten any skin, but I got the only one I actually wanted, and damn, do I wanna show it off. And when I do, it's gonna have a special meaning for me. Every time I play Officer Caitlyn, I'll remember why I bothered to try, why I wished every opposing team good luck and hoped they'd have fun, and why I try to do the same in turn. I'll remember that whenever people honor me, they do it for a reason, and that every good word doesn't go unnoticed, because even if it's something as small as a four letter \"glhf\", someone, somewhere, is taking notice.\r\n\r\nSo thank you, Rito-senpai, for noticing me. I tried my best. I'm glad it wasn't all for nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"MisaEphram","date":"2015-01-11T14:44:43.236+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"I got re gifted ammumu.......\n\nnow I want to re gift it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"aaronconlin","date":"2015-01-11T15:12:26.463+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice!

A big chunk of why I get flamed is either I'm feeding or I do something really stupid and get caught out by the enemy team or something.

Just gotta remember to check the minimap more often or buy pink wards against a Rengar, things like that. One mistake isn't the be-all end-all of the game, and as long as you took something out of it, then you're gonna come out all the better for it. I don't think making mistakes and not being good is something to be afraid of in itself. As long as you get teammates who will support you through it, or at least not flame you for it, then win or lose, it'll work out better in the end.\n\nAlso, I've seen Headhunter Cait, and ohmygod, it's amazing.

I started playing in S1, somewhere after J4's release, and that's when I liked the community the most: the game wasn't nearly as popular as it is now, there was no meta, people were all mostly confused and curious about everything. They simply didn't bother much to point out other peoples' mistakes. Of course, that might just be my personal opinion, which might be far from the truth, but still. Some of the better players remain.\n\nI slowly climbed the tiers and found a couple players who I truly enjoyed playing with. People who wouldn't flame you at all, whatever you did, however you fed. And every game would be awesome. And then I moved from EUW to NA, and the friendlist is gone. That's one major loss for me. I suggest you do the same: just play the game, keep up the positive attitude, and you'll find awesome people you never knew existed.

Heck, you could even add some people from this thread, myself included, and I'm sure we'd gladly help you learn all the curves this game has to offer.
