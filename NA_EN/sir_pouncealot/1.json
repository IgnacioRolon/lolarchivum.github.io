I'm as likely as the next chap to hit surrender if I'm not having fun or think it's hopeless. That's just a natural part of an effort versus reward matrix.\n\nIt's not a life or death struggle, and how well I play league doesn't affect my paycheck at all, so yeah... \n\nCarry, Get Carried, or Surrender makes perfect sense.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"This Is Your Dad","date":"2018-05-20T17:48:45.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kozmo tin can,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=8TxUxhfw,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-05-19T22:12:17.374+0000)\n>\n> The mystery of ranked: when your even with the enemy team your team wants to ff.
