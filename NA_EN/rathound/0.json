But if you want to have constructive discussion you should be thinking about how to buff the other summoner spells. Namely:\r\n\r\nGhost\r\nHeal\r\nBarrier\r\nExhaust\r\nTeleport\r\nCleanse\r\nIgnite\r\n\r\nIn addition to tuning CDs, here are some ideas for each summoner spell. Options are very limited though.\r\n\r\nGhost: slow resistance\r\nHeal: slow resistance, AoE\r\nBarrier: increase amount/duration\r\nExhaust: increase amount, maybe some kind of anti-tenacity\r\nTeleport: nothing other than CD, but this is pretty busted in pro play as is\r\nCleanse: nothing other than CD\r\nIgnite: probably fine the way it is","replies":[{"poster":"GreenKnight","date":"2020-02-21T22:44:47.776+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, ok.

I'd imagine the next must have would be ignite, and then something a bit more situational.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ProphetOfDraven","date":"2020-02-21T23:09:28.683+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been wondering this too.
