What the heck do you expect? Do you really expect all INHIS to be down and still have a 40% chance to win the game? Losing after taking 3 Inhis down without having any down should be outrageous. Goddamn, what am I glad that you do not balance this game.","replies":[{"poster":"cuddlykitten4","date":"2016-02-13T20:54:45.461+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey look, a guy who thinks before he speaks.

In particular, {{item:3142}} and {{item:3147}} need nerfs, but a nerf to anything with Zeal in it probably wouldn't go astray either.\n\nAlso,\n\n>It feels like individual classes reach their mid/late game status sooner than others.\n\nThis is a normal part of the game, I don't get why you'd complain about this. It's just part of balancing that some champions will tend to accelerate at different rates. It's OK to reach late game status fast if it's difficult to get through the early game, for example. Not saying this is the case currently, but I think it'd better to complain about the lack of conceivable weaknesses for some champions (e.g. Corki) rather than the rate at which they reach a certain power spike.\n\nFinally, just a small personal suggestion if Rito ever reads this thread:\n\n{{champion:238}} can easily be fixed by reducing the range on his ult's RETURN (when he uses it to escape after comboing). Currently his R has extremely large range - if you somehow walk like halfway across the map you can still basically return to his shadow. If there were more risk associated with flashing/W dashing after a fleeing enemy, it'd make Zed require more skill without making him strictly weaker. Give his ult return the range of, say, a Lux Q.","replies":[{"poster":"Noam Braumsky","date":"2016-02-13T03:51:46.009+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree on the zed ult change. The armor items you pointed out are kind of niche. DMP is great in basically every situation, but FH's mana means you won't always be able to get maximum efficiency when buying it. Not saying it's a bad armor item, but it's kind of situational. Randuins is alright, but if the enemy team doesn't really have much crits it's not as potent (granted, 10% reduction isn't too big of a deal). It seems like there's a lot of strong mr options like {{item:3065}} {{item:3190}} and {{item:3102}}, and there are more items that are more bruiser/adc options for more survivability {{item:3139}}  {{item:3156}}. \n\nI suppose the problem isn't necessarily not enough armor on items but not enough items with armor. Most are situational and it's difficult to itemize with it unless you're a tank or a bruiser who has gotten his first item already.","replies":[]}]}]}
