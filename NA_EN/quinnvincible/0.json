The normal 4 icons do, but as this is also a skin specific icon included in the bundle, and easily the best looking icon, it should also cause the dynamic background in your profile to change to the animated Gun Goddess Miss Fortune splash art. I am sure this is a bug, as you couldn&#039;t possibly have intended for a limited bundle icon associated with the skin to not change the dynamic profile background.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-03-22T20:52:18.623+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey!

She's too high up into the faded black border.  I'm not really sure how someone didn't notice this and/or chose to let it slide.  It's basically an animated background of her boobs.  This should really be adjusted, such as zooming out enough so you can actually see MF.  I checked DJ Sona and Elementalist Lux and neither of these skins have this issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kattzkitti","date":"2018-03-22T18:17:27.394+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Related threads, go upvote them as well to increase chances that this will be hotfixed ASAP!\n\n[Why does MF icon in GGMF bundle does not give you new profile look?](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/5EVbvA19-why-does-mf-icon-in-ggmf-bundle-does-not-give-you-new-profile-look)\n[MF icon with Payback bundle gives no profile background](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/Ln6xwbs5-mf-icon-with-payback-bundle-gives-no-profile-background)\n[GG MF Profile Animation](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/WJEUd0U0-gg-mf-profile-animation)","replies":[]},{"poster":"LoyalMonster","date":"2018-04-05T00:01:15.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news but the bug is still there the background still does not change. {{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unfed Kitten","date":"2018-03-24T16:13:01.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like this skin but I don't think that I want to spend $30 on a character that can just switch suits in-game vs a chroma bundle, where I can even save a couple dollars buying only the skins I want.\n\nPlease, can you do something like... add skins that change based on like karma or something?\n\nSkins of evil characters are cooler.ï»¿ And if it got more mean-looking the more kills you got with it, that would be pretty sweet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Bad Wolf ","date":"2018-03-23T03:24:57.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, I have a little trouble.
