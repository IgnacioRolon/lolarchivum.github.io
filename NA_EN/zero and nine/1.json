From where I heard it's 55% or more but the point is. I've seen players go from 30% and climb up still from Bronze to Silver + and they had a negative yet increased over time. \n\nSome players at times get bad games or a bad team comp and or possibly at times players who aren't really in the elo and the ranked system is still determining their ranks; elo-boosted accounts, people who ranked into a rank but aren't that rank so they fault down, etcs.","replies":[{"poster":"Iceember","date":"2016-08-15T00:38:01.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually with the way the LP system works ~20-25 per win and ~16-20 per loss means you can have an exact Winrate of 50% and still climb in elo. It's slow as heck but you'll climb.  My main reasoning from my first point is a counter to the OPs  statement that he crushes his lane opponent  in every single game no matter what. I first pointed out examples he didn't crush then ones where he did pretty decent. \n\nBad comps and bad games do happen and I'm not denying that they don't happen but sitting there blaming every single loss on your teammates is just not feasible as for you to have lost there must have been something you could have done. Especially after crushing your lane opponent.\n\nI clearly understand the issues of dynamic Q and why many higher elo players feel frustrated with it but High Bronze to Low silver comparatively  contain players of nearly the same skill level. There are maybe a few discrepancies but nothing as massive as the skill gap  between D5 and D1.\n\nAll in all I'm just saying that the OPs  attitude  and reluctance to learn is the reason why he is low silver and not diamond as he claims he should be...","replies":[{"poster":"NoRunesMasteries","date":"2016-08-21T00:36:04.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do agree with you entirely with how the OPs attitude and other means leads to him being where he is on the MMR scale or ELO placement _however_ the LP system doesn't necessarily work that way. God I wished it did. I have friends who have 55% win rate and yet they're gaining 19LP per say.\n\nI mean there are some Diamonds who with positive above 50% win rate only gain around 9LP or 10+LP.  Correct me if I am wrong but I do believe the LP system works entirely differently and the reason the OP doesn't gain much is because he's probably not in the ELO he is placed in, simply meaning he is slowly decaying to where he should be.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"zero and nine","date":"2016-08-14T19:27:07.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"ooooo 2 games, im not saying im a god.
