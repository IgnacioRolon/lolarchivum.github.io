This, I think, should apply to stealth, so while I don't think going invisible is necessarily bad in itself (champions are largely invisible as they roam around the map, for example, even with proper ward placement), I take issue with how so many stealth champions can also one-shot people. Shaco and Kha'Zix are currently among the worst offenders, as both have their damage loaded in such a manner that they can kill people within the first few moments of popping out of stealth, which makes them uninteractive overall.\n\nIf a champion could attack anyone from stealth, but then took actual time to kill them, they would likely still be healthy in spite of their stealth, and I think this is the kind of philosophy that should be applied to these champions: instead of necessarily trying to give stealth itself more counterplay, it might help to give these champions counterplay when they're actually fighting, namely by giving their opponents a chance to escape or fight back. I know that's a painful thing to say in an environment where the targets for assassins can usually take advantage of that small window to receive craptons of shields, heals and peel, but then again the latter is the problem, more than the former (assuming the slower burst is done right, rather than forced awkwardly into those champions' kits).","replies":[]},{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2018-04-24T19:29:07.841+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stealth was fine when you could buy Pink wards to counter it.
