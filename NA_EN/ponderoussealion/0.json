Doubled crit chance and a crapload of arpen tacked onto his ultimate just make him a pain to deal with with no real drawbacks for him. However, I find his gameplay patterns to be mostly alright. His ease of farming in lane due to his manaless-ness can be a bit problematic but I think overall his big problems are that bonus arpen and crit chance, making itemizing vs him incredibly difficult while not adding any meaningful counterplay elements.\r\n\r\n{{champion:134}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:127}} All seem to suffer from the gameplay pattern of \"either they have banshee's or QSS and they live or they don't and they die\". The whole burst mage concept SHOULD exist, and can exist beautifully in champions such as {{champion:99}} {{champion:101}} (both champions have a dodgeable skillshot that sets up the rest of their kits to do damage, which is a HEALTHY GAMEPLAY ELEMENT imo), but tacking on a, for all intents and purposes unavoidable, stun just makes it feel like there's only one thing you can do to survive or nothing at all. Veigar especially would become a huge problem and be immediately nerfed if everyone realized how strong he is. These champions do have drawbacks in their relative immobility and mana pools but at the same time are played in such a way that they're either overbearing or worthless- not really fun for anybody.\r\n\r\n{{champion:84}} {{champion:19}} Both have random heals tacked onto their kits. Both have entirely point and click gameplay patterns. Both are unhealthy in their current states. Nuff said.\r\n\r\n{{champion:150}} Another ball of stats champion with HUGE utility in his kit. Hell, his transformation in and of itself is an unhealthy gameplay mechanic. For the 15 seconds or whatever that he's transformed almost nobody can go toe to toe with him, especially in laning, thereby reducing any chance of fighting back against him in that state. Then he becomes a ranged champion with a great escape! There's just no winning vs this guy. \r\n\r\n{{champion:64}} While I love Lee Sin dearly, he IS rather problematic. He shares this problem with {{champion:236}} in that both of them give everything you could want in a jungler or marksman, respectively. Their kits are just too well rounded. Not to mention {{champion:64}}  also has a bunch of random ass stats just popped into his kit willy nilly. Spellvamp, Lifesteal, Bonus AS, incredibly high base ad and some of the best utility in the game mean something has to be done about {{champion:64}} \r\n\r\nI hope Riot gets around to addressing some of these champions at some point or another. Whether they get random stat bonuses that are poor gameplay elements on their own or just have their own play patterns that don't make for interesting champion interactions, the key points I addressed here are big problems with the way League of Legends is being played.","replies":[{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2014-12-31T19:02:39.072+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"Riot only wants older champions to have counterplay.

Also, you're entirely missing the point of double crit. Crit doesn't mean anything unless you have the damage to back it up. What will hit harder, a person who constantly hits for 5 damage or a person who hits for 2 damage, doubled by crits? All shiv does is make it easier for him to farm and harass.

I can shut down Cass simply by roaming and turning around (whether on purpose or accidentally) when she ults. My counterplay to Azir is \"stay far away unless he's dumb and burns his escape and his ult and I'm OK to take significant damage\". I'm not buying the \"new champs have just as much counterplay\" thing. And how Gnar loses to poke when his poke outranges virtually everyone and he can hop away from poke himself is beyond me. Kalista may not do as much damage as most ADCs when her support sucks but that doesn't mean she isn't ridiculously good against skill shot mages and anything melee. Yasuo can't even be itemised against if the game doesn't end by 20 minutes.\n\nBraum and Vel'Koz have fine counterplay. Vel is a standard mage with mediocre CC and a channeled ult of all things and Braum's projectile shield is a well-made Windwall. Everything since them, not so much.","replies":[{"poster":"Dengeden","date":"2015-01-01T14:02:03.437+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> You list all of these newer champs with whom the counterplay usually amounts to \"catch them out when they're dumb\" \n> \n\nNo?

Fiora is literally \"the Duelist\"- She SHOULD have insane base AD. And Tryndamere cannot dive you at level 6 \"no matter what\". If he's already chucked down half your hp and he's at full and you're sitting under tower, then yes, he's going to dive you. Yasuo is a different case- I would much rather see him producing flow with e again or have windwall up more often than have random steroids that don't influence how he is played. He would be played (possibly not built) in the exact same manner whether or not he had 50 percent arpen and extra crit or not.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Xela Syab","date":"2015-01-01T19:18:42.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah I hate Gnar and Lee, (gnar needs nerfs to his base tank stats so he's killable and not a terrible kiting lanebully Alistar/Vayne/Sivir hybrid) (lee needs nerfs to the missle speed on his q it moves way faster than any skillshot in the game which is how he ganks so well and is such a successful assassin) I think Luc is balanced now with his passive nerf. Akali and WW do have alot of sustain. Yas is ok he's like Yi if you have ranged cc you can shut him down.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DlGNITY","date":"2014-12-31T21:22:51.863+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":3,"body":"{{champion:45}} Idea:\n\nPassive/Q stays the same.\nW gives a large slow for a short amount of time, maybe followed by a small slow (5%-10%) for around 5 seconds to give him a little chasing ability.\nE is a 1/1.5 second channel.\nR becomes an AP + Mana steal from an enemy champion.\n\nVeigar should still have roughly the same burst except he wouldn't just delete people who build AP, but still follow the Q-stacking, mage counter theme that he is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cloud273","date":"2014-12-31T20:55:31.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"The mages listed by OP are perfect in every way and deserve to be nerfed (especially Veigar). Lux and Xerath are fine the way they are, because it's actually possible to dodge their skillshots. With Veigar, even if he misses his stun, you're still trapped inside the box, so he is REWARDED for missing a skillshot. Doesn't make a lot of sense. And I'm not going to accept mobility as a weakness, because they can just get boots and it fixes that problem. And boots of mobility is an EXTREMELY cheap item. Meanwhile the item needed to counter them costs about 1600 gold.","replies":[]}]}
