Although, researching after the event i found out the 14 day ban was the last warning before the perma-ban.  \n  \n   I am proposing a new idea where riot will have the toxic summoners sign a warning with 'I Agree' that says, this is your last warning next ban with be permanent.  similar to the 'I Agree' after accounts first AFK.

The other 40% is \"Wtf are you doing\" etc....etc...\n(Lets say the players on twitch justify these winning concepts to the game, and make millions from those facts. MILLIONS. That is why you choose to use them/ tell other players to use them).\n\nHowever, because the other player is having a bad game and has a duo/ pre-made group. They flame and blame those not in their group. In the end they choose to  issue reports to all the players that are not apart of their group.  Result 1 out of the 3 or two players not apart of their group gets banned. So in my opinion i dont think everyone is at fault. Some players do know what they're talking about, otherwise they wouldn't be pro athletes, or trying to be.\n\n-Dr. Milgrim did a group experiment where, even when people knew they where wrong and didnt trust their own perception they'd group with any person that sounded right/ or wrong. Dr. Milgrim believed this to be a cause of many factors including insecurities.\n\nNow is it ethical to get banned, or have to accept the terms, even if you're right and they pretty much \"unethically survivored\" your ass? \nAll because of some ego trip by a group of immature player/s that know how to abuse the system?\nToo me that is toxicity at the finest degree. Is there anything being done to them? Probably not.\n\nLets say you're a player on the edge to becoming banned, and you're apart of that same game. You dont want to lose your shit right?  However, Trump is throwing a tantrum, him and his admins just forced you to lose your acct, because they wanted to be irrational and report everyone in their wake. Now what?\n((i dont know if riot gives you a way out; its pretty black and white; accept terms or not)).\n\nShould there be an advocacy or system for these kind of players? i think so yes.\nSome may be smart enough to be able to use these issued copied text's to their advantage (why issue them in the first place?). Those messages are cut and dry, either condemning you or not, and they have the amount of games too. That's pretty good physical evidence to lift any unethical ban. Especially for players that spend a lot time and money on the game.\n\nThey may also have Riot points too that are still valid and only accessed through that account. Will Riot refund them their Rp that they actually paid for, or will they need a valid receipt? i think they can potentially get in trouble for things like this. After all you here ppl calling out for gifts. Young users understand that skins are expensive. Which is more reason why they would want to keep their account active. If ppl paid real money for it, and if they get blamed with no way to prove they're innocence. i think someone can potentially feel cheated by Riots system, and that can be bad.\n\nI think it would probably be a good idea to look into something like an advocacy/ system after a report/ terms issue. After all the text messages that you can copy pretty much tell you what games you have been reported on. By looking at your match history you could potentially deem which players chose to report you. I think if a system could bring up your reported chat messages and separate them by game. It would be cool to create a system that could cross its data to see if any of those users (the ones that issued a report on you) are linked to any other issued reports within the system.\n\n if the system deems that the probability of that player reporting another is greater than 1 (100%), or whatever threshold, they're potentially the problem as a toxic player overall (cops use a type of (pattern recognition) to find criminals through their \"reports\"). Then by using some crazy coding they could probably double check their data by seeing (X) amount of reports = to (X) amount of games within (x) amount of limits per person (or something like that, its just an idea). \nThen if those players are linked to other cases through which they are identified as a problem mathematically by the system. Then a legit tribunal within that program can justify to reactivate a players account or not, as well as, punishing those that abuse the system, rightfully.\n\n-I think one of the limits should be that if there are more than one player on each others friends list and in a single game. During which ever match que (solo/duo, norms etc..etc..) first person of that pre-made group to issue a report can; however, all others players attached to that players group are  now voided. So if the person with the problem, has a problem, then they may issue a valid report. which can be tallied, rightfully. \nIt is just compromised integrity if you have two or more friends basically crying wolf together.. Data like that could be used to see which players are abusing the system with their cohorts. and those that are being banned get banned rightfully, and not wrongfully. as well as having a voice to keep playing the game they enjoy so much. Just a thought.\nThanks for painfully reading this idea lol.","replies":[]}]}
