While doing that placement. again the game crashed and the game was of course remake because of the fact someone leaving would cause team to want to quit. However being in that placement the game was counted as a placement match. I truly don't mind losing the game and losing the game fairly to better players. I see it as a learning experience however i don't  like playing a game when its out of my control if i win or lose because at that point. Its the clients in causing it to have errors. Please again i don't mind the game being a remake i enjoy the feature what i do mine is my rank being dropped from Silver 5 to bronze 5 because Riot client had a Bug splat due to corrupted files. Its completely unfair This is the 4th time i have have Corrupted files apparently that goes away the moment i repair the files. However before game there is no way to tell if the files need to be fixed it just kicks you out of game the moment it starts having error they remake the game and you are dropped a huge amount in rank because of the fact that The patch that was just released is causing people to have corrupted data files.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-16T22:45:01.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't seen any big influxes or corrupted data reports.
