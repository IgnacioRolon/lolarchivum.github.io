Ever since patch 7.24 I have had this same exact issue in about 70% of my games: champ select goes smoothly > loading screen goes fine until everyone hits 100% > it says that my ping is massively spiking and the game starts before I leave loading screen > Through no means can I reconnect to the game. I have tried to reconnect by: restarting load screen, restarting client, restarting computer, signing into account on different computer. I am basically 100% sure that this is an issue on Riot's side, as I have never had any sort of trouble of this variety in the past on this same computer and wifi, and it has happened profusely ever since the release of 7.24. PS: the first time it happened I assumed it was some fluke and I told my premade team not to remake as I assumed that I would have no trouble reconnecting, but, as you could probably guess, this would be the first time I experienced this bug. After the remake threshold passed, it was clear that for whatever reason I would not be connecting to this game. At 15 minutes, my friends attempted an early surrender, but it failed 4-1. For some reason the game was counting my vote towards the surrender even though I never connected to the match. Thanks for reading.\r\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-09T18:24:35.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't noticed any server issues recently blocking access to the game server, but your details do suggest some network instability.
