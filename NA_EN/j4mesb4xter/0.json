Until it runs more smoothly, could the dodge punisher be removed? It wouldn't be a huge deal since we're in preseason. I recognize I'm one person and that proposed solution could have anarchical implications I'm unaware of because league is massive, well-oiled machine. I'm not upset because this is a beautiful game that is magically free and I'm grateful, but I know you care about your players so I thought I would post. Thanks, Riot. Merry Christmas.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-15T16:48:02.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The updated client is still in testing, so you could run into issues.  We aren't able to remove queue dodge or LPQ penalties, but you can also return to the legacy client at any time:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nOtherwise, be sure you're not running nay third party apps like play.tv as they've been known to also cause issues during champion select.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"J4mesB4xter","date":"2016-12-18T02:35:10.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that makes sense. thank you :D","replies":[]}]}]}
