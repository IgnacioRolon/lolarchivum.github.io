Going to investigate roger-side to see if I can come up with anything.\n\n[Edit]\nConfirmed ISP problem.  It's happening to people playing multiple games, etc.  The only thing I can find Roger wise in terms of updates is \"We're aware there's a problem in Ont.\" on their main website, and a 3 hour ETA on the fix from about 2h ago.  Doesn't seem likely they'll solve it soon.  Seems like it issue started around 12-2 p.m. today (or at least people started reporting it around then).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Popstar AkaIi","date":"2017-03-10T00:43:25.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And Fyi its not firewall because i don t use it. its not my internet because it read 30 ping all across the board as well as CMD using ping 216.52.241.254 -t \nthere is legit nothing that has been changed on my computer anywhere all up to date. so i know for  fact its ur game.","replies":[{"poster":"Popstar AkaIi","date":"2017-03-10T00:44:58.289+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is literally every 5 minutes. disconnect after a constant 30 ms ping","replies":[{"poster":"PSB Anxiety","date":"2017-03-10T01:52:32.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"get ahold of your isp it seems like it has something to do with them","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TiffTac","date":"2017-03-10T01:46:58.574+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same issue.
