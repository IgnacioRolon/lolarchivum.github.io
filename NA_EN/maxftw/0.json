Had to force shut down and had been remaked when rejoined.\r\nSecond: crashed 2-3 seconds after joining the game. Tried to reconnect after force shut down and crashed again.\r\nAnyone has that problem too? It may be my computer or it's the game. (Not playing on Mac.

I've hard a similar issue to this, that could be what you're describing.  If you recently updated Windows 10, the xbox game bar has been causing freezing issues for some players.  I suggest disabling the [Xbox Game Bar ](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) just in case and see if that helps!  Also remove any third party programs you have running for league like play.tv.  Let me know if that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Maxftw","date":"2016-09-13T22:34:09.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk if that changed anything but now it's working!
