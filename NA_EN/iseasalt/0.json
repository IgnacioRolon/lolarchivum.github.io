It&rsquo;s a very slow progress to climb as a support, because you&rsquo;re so TEAM RELIANT.\r\nAnyway, my main question is, is it worth to continue? I&rsquo;m on a losing streak at the moment, and I&rsquo;m so pissed. I mean, in one of my recent games, I asked if my Ashe could focus more on farm cause it was so shitty, and she was like: &rdquo;yo the reason I&rsquo;m 0/5 is because I haven&rsquo;t played Ashe in like 3 months&rdquo; as if it was a good excuse in ranked, which made me FUSODKCLDPLEPQ&Aring;DKGIG&Ouml;DLRJEPWPROOGPF&Ouml;D.\r\nAfter that game I was like: bitch I&rsquo;m quitting cause I&rsquo;ve wasted 4729293 years to only climb two PATCHES. So I went mid, Taliyah, and I lost which made me tilt so hard. I haven&rsquo;t played LoL since, and I&rsquo;m feeling the pressure is lightening. \r\nSo, should I keep grinding in my definitely most experienced role (support) while dealing with shitty teammates (sometimes they&rsquo;re super good though, sometimes), or should I jump into more impacting roles which I completely suck at (though I could practice in normals)?","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-05-20T07:49:57.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what i see you play mainly enchanter supports.\n\nclimbing using enchanter supports in lower elo is going to be frustrating.\n\nIf you feel changing roles is the best solution, here's what i want you to try first.\n\ntry playing carry support before you take up the idea of role switching, just try that and see how it feels. play things like brand/vel/zyra etc etc. and if they don't go well then try exploring other roles.","replies":[{"poster":"iSeaSalt","date":"2018-05-20T07:59:16.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Too Unlucky,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bjhE0pNE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-05-20T07:49:57.458+0000)\n>\n> From what i see you play mainly enchanter supports.\n> \n> climbing using enchanter supports in lower elo is going to be frustrating.\n> \n> If you feel changing roles is the best solution, here&#x27;s what i want you to try first.\n> \n> try playing carry support before you take up the idea of role switching, just try that and see how it feels. play things like brand/vel/zyra etc etc. and if they don&#x27;t go well then try exploring other roles.\n\nHm... the thing is I heard that carry supports are really good in super low elo, like bronze 4. But in my experience, in bronze 2-1, the supports are getting better, while the adc’s still suck. My point is, you don’t fucking know how crowded these elos are with Leona’s and Blitz’s, who totally counters the likes of Zyra, and other heavy poke/damage supports. The only options against these aggressive supports are... PEEL. That’s why I mostly go enchanter supps like Lulu and Janna, and sometimes Alistar and Taric when we need it. \nAlso carry supports are so HATED by adc’s in my elo, while Lulu Janna Alistar are fucking worshipped (idk) xD\nBut I shall try out Zyra perhaps, I played her alot in season 7 when I was silver 3... (good times)","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-05-20T08:06:03.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=iSeaSalt,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bjhE0pNE,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-05-20T07:59:16.050+0000)\n>\n> Hm... the thing is I heard that carry supports are really good in super low elo, like bronze 4.
