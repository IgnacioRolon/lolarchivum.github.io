Disabling all sound (in the settings) fixes the issue _completely_. This issue was on the PBE as well, but the bug report link was down for pretty much the entire duration, and my forum post was ignored. \n\nThe problem is FPS lag, which increases over time depending on the number of sounds that have gone by, as well as the champions in game. Aurelion sol is particularly heavy on this, as are a few other champions. Disabling sound completely and totally removes any lag at any state. However, reenabling sound returns you to the same state you were at before. \n\nI've experienced spikes of OVER 30 SECONDS of frame lag from this bug.\n\nThis is not: hardware issues\nLikely not: Driver issues (if so, you have an easy workaround. Just disable the audio change you did this patch). \nThis si not: network issue.

So I do not think it is related to computer's age but rather to the patch (6.6). In my opinion, the issue is not only in team fights. Even during some trades and ganks I saw my FPS drop but it was still playable (30-40). I do not know if you have the same issue too but I noticed that sometimes I lost some frames like a little freeze for less than one second.\n\nOh and yeah I have also audio issues too. But maybe it is only due to the low FPS issue (if the computer is hard working for the frames maybe he would missed some audio parts). I have already noticed this issue too when I use my headphones. To resolve this, I need to turn off the sound and then re-enable it 10s later.\n\nBy the way Apple released 10.11.4 earlier.
