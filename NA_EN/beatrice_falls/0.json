How is this system any better? Water Walking isn't used on anyone besides Aurelion Sol, the only runes that matter are the ones that directly increase your damage output, and Electrocute as a keystone has gotten so bad that its become the standard to use it on champions it wasn't meant for (Hello TLD meta). \n\nThe runes in the old system were there purely for early game stat optimization. Maokai took attack speed runes because his AA animation was ass and needed the extra AS to last hit well. Hecarim took movement speed runes because it helped him get through jungle faster while also increasing his AD thanks to his passive. Mages took Mpen marks because wave clear and better trading in lane. It made SENSE back then, even if many parts of the system went unused. Every champion had a specific setup for early game with runes.

So instead of doing 7% more only to low health enemies, he can do 11% more damage to everyone because he&#x27;s below the health threshold in his passive.\n\nwell I am surprised that you can take a domination rune on the precision tree since the ult CD reduction rune was moved to the domination tree a while ago... so there goes one of the options there leaving an entire part that he really doesn't care since he doesn't care about lifesteal or AS... he might care about the tenacity one I guess but that's more of \"there is nothing else I can use here\" than anything. Yes you can do more damage by going either Last Stand or Coup the Grace but is that what Karthus really needs when he already does a ton of damage?","replies":[{"poster":"Weiss Guertena","date":"2018-08-28T01:16:16.800+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"While it's hard picking a Domination rune in Precision tree, it's pretty damn easy picking Presence of Mind which was reworked to \"takedowns, after a 1-second delay, restore 20% of your maximum mana and **refund 10% of your ultimate's maximum cooldown.**\"","replies":[{"poster":"My Waifu Vanilla","date":"2018-08-28T01:28:11.998+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shhhhh reading comprehension is hard.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2018-08-28T17:07:46.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Weiss Guertena,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PXxJEmrW,comment-id=0000000300000000000200000000000100000000,timestamp=2018-08-28T01:16:16.800+0000)\n>\n> While it&#x27;s hard picking a Domination rune in Precision tree, it&#x27;s pretty damn easy picking Presence of Mind which was reworked to &quot;takedowns, after a 1-second delay, restore 20% of your maximum mana and **refund 10% of your ultimate&#x27;s maximum cooldown.**&quot;\n\nif you are in such a desperate need for mana on Karthus who loves so many mana items and already is going sorcery to get what is essentially the \"I don't run out of mana ever rune unless I spam nonstop even when nobody is around\" rune then I have nothing to say","replies":[{"poster":"Weiss Guertena","date":"2018-08-28T23:27:05.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are so thick to completely overlook the \"10% off my long-ass CD ultimate for every opposing champion that dies within a 10 seconds of me casting it\" aspect and still hold onto mana as the main reason to pick PoM, then I too have nothing more to say.","replies":[{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2018-08-29T14:29:42.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Weiss Guertena,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PXxJEmrW,comment-id=000000030000000000020000000000010000000000010000,timestamp=2018-08-28T23:27:05.662+0000)\n>\n> If you are so thick to completely overlook the &quot;10% off my long-ass CD ultimate for every opposing champion that dies within a 10 seconds of me casting it&quot; aspect and still hold onto mana as the main reason to pick PoM, then I too have nothing more to say.\n\nso you going domination + precision tree? because the precision tree has no ult CDR rune anymore, it got moved to the domination tree...

Sorcery tree isn't Precision tree. It got reworked and moved into Domination tree.\n\nPresence of Mind is a Precision rune. It got reworked into giving ultimate CD reduction. It didn't get moved out of Precision tree.\n\nIf it is still too hard to grasp, do the following steps: Type \"google.com\" in your browser. Type \"lol wiki precision\" in search box.
