It&#039;s a kit issue, and a matter of numbers too. You can&#039;t keep touching her numbers while leaving her kit in this state. She&#039;s not a stat-checking champion like {{champion:23}} {{champion:11}}. It&#039;s her kit itself that is toxic. I can&#039;t believe she actually got released in this state, this is a damn joke to have a champion&#039;s kit resumed around &quot;hit 2 skillshots and you one shot your opponent gg&quot; while even more tools that aren&#039;t even related to her class.\r\n\r\nDid you even ask yourself &quot;what class does she belong to ?&quot; I keep calling her an artillery mage since her main source of damage is a long ranged nuke (same as old {{champion:76}} which was an artillery mage and not an assassin), but she has damage added randomly everywhere in her kit that missing her main source of damage doesn&#039;t matter since she can deal damage with other spells (and mentionning that her Q has a really low cooldown). If you catch a ranged mage, you&#039;re supposed to be allowed to destroy him, since his main source of power is being ranged. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vkdeqnEkAQ\r\n\r\nJust look at this first clip to prove my point, I wouldn&#039;t have minded if she was actually extremely fed, but she has as much gold as the {{champion:202}} and managed to 100-0 him by missing her entire combo, because of the random damage she gets from everywhere.\r\n\r\nPlease Riot, when you see threads on Reddit asking about the removal of a champion, and the most upvoted answers are all about {{champion:142}} (and most answers are also about Zoe), it should ring bells","replies":[{"poster":"theChibiTina","date":"2018-08-10T13:16:27.560+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Qtpie also missed his abilities, she had a redemption proc, and it's not like she 100-0 him that quickly. It was a drawn out battle. The kind you rarely see anymore. Zoe was pretty close to dead herself before the redemption proc went off. If qtpie had gotten that final fourth shot free crit off in time, Zoe would have died as well. The redemption went off and he died just before he could fire it though.","replies":[{"poster":"Beatrice falls","date":"2018-08-10T13:26:03.236+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"Missed his abilities ?\" His Q is point and click and he's a marksman -_-","replies":[{"poster":"theChibiTina","date":"2018-08-10T13:36:14.876+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay.
