When I upgraded my storage I decided to redownload it. It is currently stuck at \"Updating Interface Step 1/2--------------32%\". I have changed my region from NA to Oceania, Deleted everything and tried again, restarting my computer. Nothing seems to work, any suggestions?\n\nEdit: We made it to 38% but stuck at \"applying patches\", any help?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-03T23:24:31.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At this point in the process, your network is trying to reach the patching servers to download updates then apply them.  Unless you are getting any errors, it's best to leave it alone.  By deleting or stopping this, you run the risk of corrupting your game as well as restarting the entire process over again.  My recommendation here is to let it do its thing until it's done.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]}]}
