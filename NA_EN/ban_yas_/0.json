So that's what i did, but honestly i have no idea what any of this means but there were alot of \"ERROR\" and \"WARN\". So if any help could be offered it would be greatly appreciated, guess im missing URF weekend {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"FeedingForAfrica","date":"2017-08-12T16:50:02.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the EXACT same issue as OP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-12T02:20:51.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It almost sounds like your client may have lost it's admin privileges if you were able to play normally after running the client as administrator.
