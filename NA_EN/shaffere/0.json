So i recently got accepted into the PBE and I get a WinRar folder or whatever when I download the launcher and I got it patched and everything and i didn't have time to play at that time when it finished, so I closed the launcher and came back thinking I cant just open the launcher again and play but i guess i was mistaken!\r\n\r\nDo I have  to patch **EVERY TIME** I want to play PBE, or is there something wrong, can I just get like a desktop shortcut?\r\n\r\n**Please! If someone could help me that would be AMAZING!** \r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-11T19:32:08.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe that's simply the nature of the PBE.  It's constantly going to pull updates, even tiny ones, as testing continues onwards.  Feel free to share your feedback on the[ PBE boards ](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/)for consideration.  Good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"ShafferE","date":"2016-11-12T04:46:27.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, its not updating, its as if it is installing the thing each and every time.","replies":[]}]}]}
