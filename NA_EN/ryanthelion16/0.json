One of the intentions of the new jungle is to push different champions into different clear paths based on the abilities of their champs and the general game state.  I think it's been really great, as you're not really forced to do a straight clear and have a lot of decisions to make each game about the path you want to take.  \n\nFor example, on Diana, who I've been experimenting with lately, I'll skip raptors and krugs if I start at blue-side's red buff.  When I'm red-side and start on Blue buff, I'm level 3 by the time I get to raptors and can decide if I want to level E for a quick gank or put a second point in Q and go ahead & take the camp.  \n\nI LOVE that the game circumstances change what decisions I make there.  Before the recent changes, I kept to the same jungle path for most junglers in almost every single game, because it was simply too advantageous not to.  Obviously this occasionally changed based on jungle invades or lanes super pushed up somewhere, but most of the time I could replace my first 3 minutes of the game with a macro and not see the difference.  \n\nJust like each time there are significant changes to the jungle, there are some champs who are winners and losers.  I'm much happier with Riot fixing those as they come than not keep improving on the experience.","replies":[{"poster":"Shadow Hazard","date":"2016-12-14T00:26:41.161+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mentioned specifically beyond the first clear (although any champ that can't at least do a full clear first clear are the easily worst), there are many champs that can't handle that camp even after their first clear, diana was a poor example as she is solidly in the group of AoE type champs that can actually reliably do a healthy full clear for first and beyond.\n\nThe changes in general were made so the different type champs have advantage over others for the camps, but is in a state that some champs flat out cant even do the camps while some cant.
