I used to relog over and over to fix this and when that didn&#039;t work I resorted to the legacy client. When I heard that the legacy client was about to be retired I thought &quot;ok cool. Surely this issue will be fixed by then, and worse comes to worse a client repair should do the trick. Turns out I was wrong for assuming. Now my client greys out play and suggest I restart the client (lol). I do this over and over, nothing helps. I tried resetting my internet options. I tried forcing the patch with the hextech client that as far as I can tell doesn&#039;t actually do anything but generate logs. I also tried the reinstall and that didn&#039;t seem to do anything either. (Truthfully, despite having the logs. There seems to be no evidence that the hextech client does anything at all. At no point does the client begin a new update. Nor does it reinstall.). \r\n\r\nI really hope this gets fixed. It seems kinda messed up to remove the legacy client if the new one is still this buggy.....I actually like the new client, and would prefer to use it over the legacy client. But at least when the new client was pretty looking and buggy, I could fall back on legacy. Without legacy, now all I have is pretty, buggy, and unplayable....","replies":[{"poster":"LiL Batman","date":"2017-05-20T01:43:57.491+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for reporting the issue.
