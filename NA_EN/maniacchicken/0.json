It just feels different say from Boom Boom Blitz. I'll give you an example from last night. Exiting top base along with our minion wave. I was attempting to chase down 1 enemy. The wave actually blocked me from exiting the base \"stairs\" and then made me try path around the melee minions. Obviously this caused me to miss the opportunity to make a kill. I have never encountered something like that playing 2 other Blitz skins. It just seems off ever so slightly.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-18T23:30:04.698+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't forget! \n\nThis may have been an issue with pathing in general.

I did get stuck once between the wall and minion last week which resulted in a death haha. I was at full life, Vayne was at 20%. Bad situation all around. Other than that no other issues. Perhaps I've gotten used to the new dimensions and run.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-28T19:07:29.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're welcome! \n\nGah, I've had similar things happen and it's the worst.
