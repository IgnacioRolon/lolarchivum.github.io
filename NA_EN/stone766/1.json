I just got out of a really long game, and it finally ended after 70 minutes (Which was new to me... im still new to LoL haha)\r\n\r\nAnyway, i was wondering if you guys could rate my miss fortune performance that game out of 10.\r\n\r\nI ended with K/D/A 20/0/20, led many pushes, destroyed a few towers and many incubators, and (in my opinion) was very key to our comeback that won us the game.\r\n\r\nI thought i did well but i wanna hear from the community so i can continue to grow as a player.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! It means a lot :)","replies":[]}
