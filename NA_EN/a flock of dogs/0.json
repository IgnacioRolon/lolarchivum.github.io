On my Windows 7 system, this setting appears under\n> Control Panel --> Display.  Hope this helps someone.\n\nThis happens because the Control Panel has multiple views.\n\nIn Windows 7 the solution options are:\n\n1. Start > Control Panel (View By: Categories) > Appearance and Personalization > Display > Set to 100%.\n\n2. Start > Control Panel (View By: Large/Small Icons) > Display > Set to 100%.\n\n3. Right-click Desktop > Screen Resolution > Make text and other items larger or smaller > Set to 100%.\n\n\nThe difference in Control Panel options is your \"View by\" setting, which is set by a drop down menu in the top right corner of the Control Panel window.\n\nPersonally, I use the Screen Resolution option on the desktop and use the \"Make text and other items larger or smaller\" hyperlink. It requires less clicks.\n\n{{champion:32}} ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"A Flock of Dogs","date":"2014-11-20T15:37:49.125+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank's!
