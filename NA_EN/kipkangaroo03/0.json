What happens is the game freezes and all I can do is ctrl alt delete to get out of it. After i close the operating system, it goes back to my desktop but I cant click on anything and the mouse pointer stays as the league pointer. This has something to do with my graphics card disabling itself when I am playing because when it happens, a error message appears saying something like (AMD has crashed and recovered). I can easily run warframe on the highest graphics and it never crashes so it is specifically league.\r\nPlease help.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-11-08T01:03:32.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First make sure you update your drivers! I'm going to emphasize how important that is first and foremost. I would also suggest disabling the X Box game bar and then after all that has been done run through our [Crash Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974).  If it continues to happen to you afterwords make sure you reach out and let me know. \n\n\n{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[]}]}
