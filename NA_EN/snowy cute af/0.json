My immediate thought was, that sucks, but, I&#039;m certainly not the type to get into problems so I&#039;ll simply go through the 25 games and reform my behaviour, not making a mistake like that again. \r\n\r\nSo, the 25 games passed - Also, a few hundred more, at least. I do my best to be positive as I usually do, every game, and my life situation improves so I&#039;ve been finding it easier to ignore trash talk and trolls. Now here I am, still honor level 0 locked at the final checkpoint. In the past few weeks I&#039;ve noticed the progression has sped up, in that I&#039;ve gone from check point 0 to checkpoint 3 in the past few weeks, and I was at 0 honor for easily 5-8 months. \r\n\r\nAnyways, now that I&#039;ve explained the situation I just had a few questions pertaining to it.\r\n\r\n1. Is there any actual hope of hitting honor level 2 or is this going to be thousands of games?\r\n\r\n2.  If I do fully reform and hit honor level 2, what happens? do I still never earn honor at the normal rate again? Is my account just forever locked in this punish state and forced to play ~500-1000 games per honor level?\r\n\r\n3. Lastly, another question about if I actually manage to reform, and hit honor level 2 - Will I then be eligible for all rewards? I don&#039;t know if Riot still does this but you used to get free skins for not having bans or restrictions in that season/year. Obviously I wouldn&#039;t get something like this for the season I had the problem in but now that it&#039;s going to be pushing 2 seasons later, will I ever be able to actually reform my account?\r\n\r\nAnyways, thanks for reading :3 Hopefully someone can give me some help c:","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-12-16T07:08:20.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have played 2000+ games, and I have to tell you.\nhonor gain is slow as shit, but even at a reduced rate, active positive behavior and honors will boost your honor to a good level!","replies":[]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2018-12-16T00:36:19.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You already are earning honor at the normal rate.\n\nYour honor may be slowed, as it would for any player, if you are being validly reported in games, even for minor toxicity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2018-12-16T00:23:51.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. You should definitely be able to hit Honor 2 in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n2. Your honor rate will return to normal eventually, if it hasn't already! Unless your behavior is negative, in which case it may not.\n\n3. If you were *only* chat restricted for the 2018 season and because of that missed out on Ranked rewards, you can still earn them if you reach Honor 2 by Feb. 11th!

Awesome! Thanks for all the help, I've been worrying about this a while but I'm really happy to know that I can just keep working at my account.
