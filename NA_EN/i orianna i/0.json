I didnt think this would happen because on the champion mastery page it says its only avaliable on summoners rift and I was wondering if there is anyway to get this reverted because i have 46k mastery on ori on this account and really dont want to ruin it. Thank you","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-18T21:12:25.261+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Champion mastery scores were enabled for a few other game modes a few patches ago!  With the nature of ARAM, it's now possible to receive points with other champions.  Unfortunately, it's not possible to remove these points.  Take heart though, your dedication for Orianna will go unquestioned!","replies":[{"poster":"I Orianna I","date":"2016-08-19T21:27:46.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you i didnt think it was possible but thought it was worht an ask XD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RengClaw","date":"2016-08-18T05:07:08.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont think you can sorry","replies":[{"poster":"I Orianna I","date":"2016-08-18T15:32:32.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea i didnt think so thanks for looking over it though :)","replies":[]}]}]}
