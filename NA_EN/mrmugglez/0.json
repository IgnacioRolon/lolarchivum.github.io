Although there is a small delay in when he actually moves, I'll chalk that one up to ping, as I average 60 ms.\r\n\r\nI haven't played in a couple weeks, but I definitely DON'T remember the camera being THIS unresponsive. I really wanted to play, but after fiddling around with the camera in a custom game for a bit find the game to be unplayable (there is even camera jitter if I play with camera locked on.)\r\n\r\nany suggestions on how to fix would be great!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-28T00:00:47.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The camera is still going over to an area of the map where data is being sent back and forth from your network to the game server.
