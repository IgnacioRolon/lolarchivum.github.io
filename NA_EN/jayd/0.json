I'll load up into a game, then mid way through the loading screen I'll get a bug splat and will continue to get them until I restart the game, where it will then inform me, \"Data corruption detected. Repair recommended\" Something along those lines. It forces me to get to the game late/leaver buster if a remake was possible (Most of the time it isn't.) since I'm stuck repairing the darn thing.  Please help me out, I don't want to get banned or restricted because this is affecting me AND my teammates if I cannot connect to the match in time.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-11T01:00:23.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bugsplats are the results of a few potential issues.

I figured out the problem shortly after I made this post(Forgot to come back here and update). One of my RAM sticks were faulty (Which is why the game was bugsplatting/currupting/pc bsod) I've since removed the stick and am just running one of them (I have  2x8gbs so I'm good until I get it replaced.)\n\n But while we're here, You know the transition from accepting the game > see the roles on the map > champion select? The animations aren't showing up for me. I'm just seeing a still picture of SR then the champion select pops up. Think you can help with this one? Thanks again!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-13T22:38:28.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm..

Is this happening on the legacy (current) client or on the Beta/Alpha Client?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
