It&#039;s really shitty actually that just because the enemy team is losing they have to make up the excuse of someone cheating just because someone is better than them.

While I recognize you are a rioter, you should also realize that you don't read our personal support tickets. I got unbanned as of 2 hours ago because your automatic system made a mistake and you have no right to accuse us of cheating when we haven't. Thanks ahead for the apology because I probably won't be back on the forums unless another \"mistake\" happens.
