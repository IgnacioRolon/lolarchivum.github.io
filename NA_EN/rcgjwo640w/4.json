Very few champions are both. For example, zed players suck massive balls in your elo, in my elo, they are good. In your elo katerina or darius can spank anyone and carry easily. Not the same in plat or diamond.\n\nAlso he has a 54 percent win rate in bronze and a 46 percent win rate in Plat where i am.

Fiora in particular both has the advantage in lane and destroys him 1v1 late game. \n\nFrankly, the people you play against are bad. Olaf is perfectly viable in any elo, but he's not broken. You dumping on bronze shitters doesn't prove he is.","replies":[{"poster":"RcGjWO640w","date":"2016-07-27T03:56:33.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess that's true. I mean.
