I hesitate to think that would design such a poor champion concept that can transition from an early game lane bully to a late game hypercarry the way he does, but matches don&#039;t lie. When on our team or the enemies, any Jhin seems to just absolutely crush their lane embarrassingly bad and them transition into the mid and late game as unstoppable hypercarries. They might have only picked up 1 kill in the laning phase, but it feels like he doesn&#039;t need anything to go off. Like Kled, he&#039;s going full I-will-100-to-0-you-with-1-salvo-and-2-abilities ham right from level 2.\r\n\r\nHe&#039;s the Zed of ADC&#039;s right now and games honestly feel like, &quot;pick Jhin, ban Jhin or if you&#039;re picking adc before the opponents, pick something that won&#039;t get crushed quite as hard by a Jhin, just in case they pick Jhin.&quot;\r\n\r\nRiot seems to like to balance champions by 3 steps:\r\n1. design champion and launch him with clearly OP scalings and base damages so people will buy the new OP champion.\r\n2. Nerf them into the ground to reel in his audience so they don&#039;t destroy the game too much.\r\n3. Give them some QoL buffs to ensure that a bit of their power comes back and they remain competitive.\r\n4. ?????\r\n5. PROFIT!!\r\n\r\nExcept with Jhin, Riot started the design launch and just forgot about steps 2 and 3. He still feels new-champ OP even though Riot says he&#039;s in check.

The bit about assassins is understated because champions who can easily gapclose and instagib a low-mobility squishy like Jhin is going to go to town on him if he doesn't get some proper peels, which is a gamble outside of pre-arranged team matches. Jhin has a ton of flexibility in his kit as far as self-peeling goes, which leaves a lot of room for outplay and makes any given scrap a partial skill matchup, but also has blatant, exploitable disadvantages and may not be the right fit for every team/the OP freelo god marksman that he is revered as.","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-08-16T17:05:11.715+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When the game hits around mid-late I would say Jhin is better off avoiding the enemy ADC all together simply because if they 1v1'd and Jhin had no help he would most likely lose the trade due lacking the damage per second, reliable CC which other ADC's have.\n\nAnd you're right i did understate his weakness to assassins. Generally Jhin is on par with Kog'maw in terms of how strong assassins are against except Kog'maw late game can potentially melt an assassin before he drops his burst. We have Cait's trap and her net. We have Ashe's arrow and her slows. We have Varus's slows and his snare. We have Kallista's hopping mobility and support ultimate. Missfortune's slow, Sivir's spell shield and ultimate, Graves/Lucians dash, etc.\n\n Jhin's only real peel is the MS boost he gains from crits and the snare from his W. I wouldn't  rely on those to stop someone with a gap closer of course which is why I want to say, Jhin's ultimate highlights the greatest weakness of Jhin himself, and that's someone getting close to him. I can't recount the number of times I have died as Jhin because someone circled around while I ulted from the backline and killed me. Maybe that's a clear statement that says I suck badly and need to 'git gud' at map awareness instead of tunnel visioning into a fight but it happens a lot.\n\nI also main {{champion:89}}  and find that the best time to target Jhin is  just as  he fires his 4th shot because he's defenseless and won't be able to put out enough damage over a short amount of time.  This is early game of course, but I'm sure knowing this might help someone else.

Jhin does have very good gameplay and scaling(I mean really 120% Ad AND 100% Ap on his trap???)\nBut I feel like his lack of mobility and attack speed balance that. Granted he converts attack speed and crit chance(I think) into raw AD, he is only able to get off 4 autos in the time ashe or jinx could get off like 10-15, and in the end they do roughly the same amount of damage. His kit is really unique and I feel like harder to play against, especially with the current meta of healer supps being more popular(like sona, soraka, and nami). With a healer, Jhin can put himself in situations that he couldn't with other supps like blitz or morgana. He also has a lot of CC compared to most ADC's. Jinx, Cait, and Jhin are the only ones that specifically come to mind with direct CC(im not counting ashe's passive slow).\nAnd while he is strong I feel like there are far better ADC champs to play. Lucian, Ezreal, and Ashe are usually regarded as stronger as well as being fair. I feel that over all, he seems fairly balanced, maybe being a bit stronger than average, but only because its harder to play against fif you've mastered him.
