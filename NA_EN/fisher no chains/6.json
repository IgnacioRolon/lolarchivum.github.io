Because their argument basically talked about gold efficiency itself. \n\nIf you are going to argue about general or personal gold efficiency, then bring that into your argument first and foremost rather than flippantly decide to categorize your examples down the road. \n\nJust because RoA is gold efficient doesn't arbitrarily make it a good item just because of pure gold efficiency alone. If you look at most tank items, most of them are gold inefficient, yet tanks still purchase them despite that. If RoA is such a great item due to how 'generally gold efficient' it is, then it should get nerfed just because of how 'OP' the price is. Yet, we don't see that because you don't look at its gold/stat ratio alone. \n\nYou have to look at the whole picture when determining what the item does, rather than 'just on paper'. Or else balancing champions would be a lot easier if you look at purely numbers.\n\nIf you look at the statistics themselves, RoA is crowded out by other AP items in terms of winrate or popularity despite it's 'general gold efficiency'. \n\nSure, RoA is the perfect buy for specific AP mages based on specific situations who can sit it out (e.g. Anivia because as long as you don't lose the lane, you're fine). However, its still not a great **must** buy like Morello is, despite better **personal gold efficiency** that RoA brings because other mages don't have the luxury of sitting out til it stacks completely without losing on other areas of the game.  \n\nMeanwhile, if you're talking purely 'general gold efficiency', Sightstone is a great buy on anyone.","replies":[{"poster":"Elikain","date":"2017-06-27T12:02:05.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Sure, RoA is the perfect buy for specific AP mages based on specific situations\n\nSo you acknowledge my point about certain champions synergizing with specific items but you still go out on a limb to argue further about Morello being a better purchase because of its gold efficiency than RoA?\n\nI never said that it's a must buy BECAUSE burst mages don't really want stacking items.\nThey need raw power now which is why they tend to remain squishy but have a deadly 100-0 combos.

For your information, it doesn't make the item good in the overall sense. That's the point. You could nitpick all you want about various things that would make it sound better than it actually is. It's like saying 'Oh, you shouldn't step outside because you would get hit by a meteorite'. It's a very small percent. It's simply not realistic.  Morello's is better not because of its gold efficiency, but because it gives you immediate stats + it is the better item for pretty much any situation. RoA is for very specific situations, despite its general gold efficiency, making it a niche item. It's really not that hard to understand. RoA still isn't a first pick on many mages. Why is that? Because there are other factors to take into account. Like RoA's 10 minute stacking time. You are already on the defensive when you decide to buy that. Meanwhile, your enemies is gaining better momentum throughout the game. \n\nActually, general gold efficiency can trump personal gold efficiency. Sightstone. They might not be personally gold efficient for mages, but they are still generally gold efficiency due to the other benefits it give. That is your and the poster I was responding to's argument. Even then, you could argue that SS is personally gold efficient and you should be able to purchase it on any mage then, because the stats on SS (HP +warding for ganks; can build into a pretty decent upgrade) works well with the utility that they offer in their kits. It's simple and cheap + the team needs wards anyways. Therefore, it means that your previous point is contradicted when you are arguing that general gold cannot be trumped by personal gold. Not that it matters because gold efficiency, general or not, isn't the only factor you take into account. \n\nBut expanding that point, you further contradicted yourself. RoA could be 'general gold efficient', but not 'personal gold efficient' for a majority of the mage roster, making it a pretty meh item, based on your own argument for burst mages to need raw power and not stacking items. \n\nBut again, because you don't get it, you don't look at numbers alone; you look at the entire situation. Whether you are gold efficient or not, if it's not useful to you, taking into account the various factors of the game, it means there's an issue. Which was why when the previous poster mentioned how beneficial RoA is for its HP for defensive purposes, they didn't take into account all the other factors. And with RoA, there's an issue. Not a big one, mind you, but an issue still nonetheless, considering a lot of the AP itemization is so restricted to niche situations.

Fiddlesticks has 480 and Morgana has **450**! So dangerous, my god! Look out for those mage basic attacks!\n\n> Champs like Syndra, Veigar and Brand can decimate from much farther away. Their kits grant an inherent safety that marksmen lack.\n\nAre you new to the game? Literally every marks(wo)man has some form of safety, whether it's CC, mobility, or both. Heck, Sivir has an on-demand Banshee's shield along with her MS passive, but everyone gets salty and cries foul about Malzahar, the mage with 0 mobility and 0 disengage, having a similar shield he can't even control.\n\nOn top of that, they all have access to several defensive items to fit their needs. Mages don't get that flexibility. \n\nAlso can't forget to mention the broken mechanic called **lifesteal**. While the mage has to rely on a few potions (if any) to stay alive and stick around to farm, the marks(wo)man gets to use their fast, hard-hitting, 0 mana basic attacks to farm, harass, and constantly heal back from any damage dealt to them. Hardly fair.\nRiot said spell vamp was unhealthy for the game, yet is perfectly fine with {{item:3812}} which also acts as a lifesteal item ( {{item:3146}} is only niche on a couple AP champs). Along with the lack of variety in AP items like AD champs have, it shows their blatant favoritism to AD champs as a whole.\n\n_\"They can decimate from much farther away.\"_\n\nIt's not like there are no marks(wo)men who don't also have long-ranged spells that hit hard (Varus? Jhin? Jinx? etc.), and ranged spells are all that mages have. It's their only purpose, but they are far from unfair. Get one of several MR items and their effectiveness is cut in half.\n\nWhat's the difference between Veigar and Caitlyn's ults? Both deal massive damage, both are targeted, one can be blocked by an ally but has many times more range, and... that's it. Funny thing is people have whined way more about Veigar's ult than Caitlyn's. Why? AD favoritism.\n_\"I was at 500 health and Veigar bursted me, wahhh!\"_\nBut if Caitlyn ulted for the kill **from off-screen**, it would be \"fair and balanced.\" Then she goes off to deal 1000+ damage with her basic attacks every half-second to everyone else and mitigating/sustaining against all the damage dealt to her because of amazing AD itemization, if they can even approach her with her 650 range, W spam and E.\n\nThis game and its community makes me so sick sometimes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZapMyHeart","date":"2017-06-25T00:47:39.962+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Yetii Rider,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=on2ZwX51,comment-id=000100020001,timestamp=2017-06-24T22:30:51.281+0000)\n>\n> Completely ignores Liandries Torment.\n> \n> RoA is cost efficient on purchase.
