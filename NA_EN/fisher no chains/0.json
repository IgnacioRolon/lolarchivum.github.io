It's also not a very exciting one. While Hexdrinker might be a bit too strong for what it does, at least its shield gives it a clear purpose. Seeker has no shield, nor any other means to prevent all-ins, while its scaling stats mechanic does nothing to aid you against the main AD threats.\n\nEven the upgraded item is a bit more niche. Some mages love zhonya's, while some don't. Not everyone needs or wants the stasis effect, so paying a lot of gold for an item with bad stats because there's no better solution feels bad. In contrast, Maw is a more generalist item, and there's always QSS/ scimitar as an alternative.\n\nBut then again, AP items are so rudimentary and outdated compared to AD items.
