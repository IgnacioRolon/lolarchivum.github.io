Assuming the 5 characters on the current VGU poll were updated, I would say a second set of 5 characters in need of a VGU would include LeBlanc. She doesn't match her lore, has jank visuals, and has degenerate gameplay that doesn't sell the fantasy at all.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if, like Irelia and Swain who sort of skipped the line on VGUs over less important/ more broken characters, LeBlanc received a VGU sooner rather than later (within a couple years).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2019-05-29T16:31:54.477+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Turns out that Granth guy was the assassin from Swain’s story.","replies":[{"poster":"LordRedStone Nr1","date":"2019-05-29T17:04:20.036+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes! That's one of the reasons I liked this lore update, tieing everything in Noxus together. It introduced General Granth, who was just killed off without explanation before. Now we know why he's going to try to kill Swain.\nJust a great update all along:\nLeBlanc has Morde's armor, clarifying stuff about the Black Rose, Cassiopeia and their business in Shurima (bonus: Timeline confirmation for Azirs Ascension, which I called 3 months ago), giving backstory to a character who we know is going to die for LB's plans, making Sion less confusing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Groove Crusader","date":"2019-05-29T18:54:31.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like how Leblanc gloats about being able to defeat tyrants while pointing to Mordekaiser's armor when it's revealed in Mordekaiser's bio that he expected and planned for it.\n\nIt's a nice little dynamic between the two characters.","replies":[{"poster":"SummonSlammer","date":"2019-09-15T14:07:09.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know I’m a tad late, however from the surface it looks like that. But from what I assume Leblanc knows about his plan. The whole story is about Leblanc sacrificing people to Mordekaisers realm. Which on paper looks good for morde (he gets more souls) however maybe Leblanc knows this and is sending sabotaged souls to him. Just my theory. Cause I doubt Leblanc is human and would fall for that trap.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Onkel Malte","date":"2019-05-30T11:44:03.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The artwork is awesome. \nI was disappointed however...the story took away a lot of the mystery behind her, through first person perspective. \nI hoped for something bigger behind the famous, several thousand year old Pale Sorceress, than a woman who's doing political intrigue and casts a few glamour spells so everyone looks like her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordRedStone Nr1","date":"2019-05-29T17:05:49.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh yeah, here's the artwork if people don't want to search for it: \nhttps://universe-meeps.leagueoflegends.com/v1/assets/images/Leblanc_Color_Story_Splash.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blood Magicks","date":"2019-05-29T16:11:42.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This lore update, it feels so good, how lovely!!!","replies":[]}]}
