When i returned home and plugged it back in i get really slow internet speeds with league. It used to be 1,000 KBps when updating, Now i get 0..., I also used to have 40 ping but now i average around 1500 ping and get constant reconnects. I have it hooked up to a power line adapter and tried factory resetting it but to no avail. I did not change any of the settings in my laptop that I'm aware of and its been going on for days now. The WiFi works fine however i can't use that because my laptop is in the basement and the router is in the attic.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-12T18:35:25.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems that you are having a network problem that's having a lot of trouble maintaining a strong connection.

I am used to having around 50-60 ms, but after this patch I have consistently been getting 77 at minimum, bouncing anywhere from 102-405 ms. It seems to happen more often than not when I get close to other players, friendly and enemy alike. I have restarted my router, check all of my firewall settings, reinstalled league, as well as going so far as to try one of those shoddy game boosters(actually seemed to help, for a little while)\n\nThis is very saddening to me, because I mainly play ranked, trying to climb that ladder. And I fear that I will get too laggy to do anything when I am playing...\n\nI have heard that you can get a little bit of lag after a patch, since there is new information that is being sent and received, but I do not believe that to be the case...there is something going on with league, at least in my opinion.....\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. \n\nThank you for your time and consideration.","replies":[]}]}
