Most reports have been of players saying that they launch League of Legends, and then nothing occurs.  There are a few steps you can take that should resolve this:\n\n1)  If you have recently upgraded to Yosemite (OSX 10.10), you may need to [complete a fresh re-installation](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends) of League of Legends on the new 10.10 version.\n\n2)  Make sure that your connection is stable.  If you are on wifi, disable this and connect directly to your router via wired Ethernet Cord.  In addition, make sure to try all of the steps in our [Connection Troubleshooting Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).\n\n3)  Some players have reported that [this trick](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/8b0EJ8nP-mac-wont-open-dec-3-2014-fix) has succeeded in opening the client.\n\nIf all else fails, don't give up just yet!  Make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to our Tech Team.  They can look into the issue further and provide some additional solutions! :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"SexyDeane","date":"2014-12-03T16:14:19.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I have a solution for this (I am running Yosemite IDK what version just got a mac) this is what i did\nI opened up league front he application folder and the patcher said \"unspecified error check crap logs blah blah blah\"\ni just left that open for like 1 min\nthen i opened league again from the application folder and it ask to terminate the other league, i press ok\nthen it says unspecified error blah blah blah\nthen i open league again from the application folder and the patcher itself opens successfully\n\nhope this works for you guys too\nyw","replies":[]},{"poster":"BROTAG0NIST","date":"2014-12-03T15:57:57.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well mine just started working lol, i just left it alone for a while and clicked on it and it started working again.
