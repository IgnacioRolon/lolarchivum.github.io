I understand and accept my 6 game chat restriction.\n\nI have played league of legends since Season 2 on a couple accounts (RIP the names and passwords i forgot). I have never had any punishments or restrictions before, despite the fact I have a poor internet connection and sporadically dc. I have dealt with plenty of toxicity, trolling, and attempted religious conversions and survived it all. However, until today, I have never had any issues with the game or community that might stop me from playing outright. \n\nToday I received what I believe to be an unjust 20 game chat restriction after just getting rid of a 6 game restriction. I will cover what happened to get the 6 game restriction before covering the 20. I only have my chat log from the 20 game restriction and will post separately below. In addition I will make a summary of each section to allow for a quicker read.\n\nEdit: I have moved the Summary from each section here for those not biologically disposed to reading a thicc rant\nEdit2: This was a horrible attempt at a joke but I'm going to keep it, please forgive me.\nEdit3: I looked at some other board posts and they often link the match history so here it is: https://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/3259418922/218695825?tab=overview\n\n\nSummary:{{summoner:13}} \n6 Game Chat Restriction\n1.

Everyone is annoyed but it is too game/person specific\n\n\n\n **GAMES**{{champion:86}} {{champion:22}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:26}} \nThe 6 game chat restriction was due to 2 normal games. In the first game, in which I was jungling, our blitzcrank support decided to troll after I failed to gank bot in a high enough frequency to meet his standards. Apparently this is more than 3 times in the first 10 minutes of the game. He then followed me around in the jungle last hitting all the jungle creeps he could. The rest of the game he continued to farm all my xp and gold and refused to do anything else. We eventually lost despite a 12 kill lead early game due to the 4v5 and lack of jg xp. In the second game our mid laner decided to repeatedly run it down mid after losing the early game. In both of these games I became frustrated with these trolls and called them apes after they repeatedly pinged and flamed me. I feel obliged to point out the types of primates I compared them to are very intelligent and closely related to humans unlike prosimians or monkeys. I may also have politely (and I mean politely) requested blitzcrank not propagate for the good of the human race. I then also may have said I was going to steal his grandmothers 401k. I understand and accept this chat restriction.\n\n\nThe 20 game chat restriction was due to a single normal game. I was supposed to be top, however our amumu jg didn't take smite and went top instead without telling anyone. I tried to jg instead (without smite) but had our janna support purposely steal the initial buff from me. I know it was on purpose because she used her zephyr (damage spell) to take it when it was below 100 health. I then, in my own lane, went a support item and did my best to win. At roughly 8 minutes in I rotated mid and last hit 6 minions under turret due to our talon mid backing at an awkward time. He took this as an offense and decided to afk in fountain after \"warning\" me to never steal his farm again. Our janna support blamed me for this, as well as saying I falsely accused her of stealing the buff, and asked in all chat for the enemy team to report me. I then spent the rest of the game in a very frustrated state repeatedly trying to defend myself from being reported in the fear that I may be banned or recieve another chat restriction. We tried to surrender the obviously hopeless game (no jg no mid) however janna refused to surrender keeping us hostage and continued to ask people to report me as \"revenge\" for what I did. I survived this hell 3/4/2 without ever trolling or saying anything mean or against guidelines. This is why I believe my second restriction to be unjust.\n\n\n{{summoner:14}} **Complaints and Potential Solutions**{{summoner:7}} \n{{item:3151}} I understand why I received the 6 game chat restriction, however I disagree with the fundamental policy because I believe it is over policing speech. The mute button is there if you do not want to hear what other people have to say. I understand that younger kids (myself included in the past) and people who dislike trash talk also play this game. The solution that I offer is that on game startup all players should be auto muted (or at least all chat) with an option to reverse this choice. This would make it easy for parents to lock this option for younger kids. I believe trash talk to be a fun part of the game and dislike the restriction of speech. I understand that threats and certain words perhaps should not be allowed, however messing with an opponent's mental through words is no different in context then emoting or dancing after a kill. I have  frequently been on the receiving end, however I don't think a few bad experiences or hurt feelings should dictate the agenda for the entire playerbase.\n\n{{item:3174}} My other primary issue is with false reporting. I am still unsure why I was chat restricted after my second game and am hoping a response will shed some light as I currently believe it to fall under this category. The situation I found myself in where someone is \"revenge\" reporting you (which they literally admitted word for word in game) I see only two options. You either attempt to explain your case for why you should not be reported or be silent and hope your team backs you up. Since the majority of my team was already trolling or afk I did not trust them to back me up. Therefore I took into my own hands to defend myself for the fear that I may be banned or recieve another chat restriction due to false reports. This obviously did not work. I have two solutions for this. \n\nThe first, and easier to implement, is to require a larger number of games (I would recommend 5 instead of 3 or in the case of my 20 game restriction only 1) that violate rules in a certain timespan in order for punishments to be enacted. Since making the timespan purely time based would allow players who don't play often or use multiple accounts to avoid punishment and making it purely game frequency based would allow those who occasionally troll avoid punishment, I believe you should combine the two to lump reports together over a 2 week period. I am not too well versed in the actual specifics of the reporting software so some version of this is probably already in effect. \n\nMy second solution would be to get rid of reports from accounts who are repeatedly reported or receive punishments. This would be much more difficult to implement due to the repercussions of \"Revenge\" reporting. In my case I would no longer have reports against me from janna and talon (from whom I instantly received the report feedback you reported someone who was punished blah blah) which would be good. However, both the blitz and mid laner from my 6 game restriction (who are still playing as we speak) as well as the talon and janna would have my reports against them removed which is bad. The easiest workaround would be utilizing machine learning (cough you hiring? cough) and/or having a team dedicated to overviewing this system. \n\n{{item:2420}} A separate issue that annoys me greatly is afking. Some games, for those of us who do other things outside of league, are a waste of time playing out due to poor gameplay at the start that sets us far behind. We could win, however that requires the enemy team to repeatedly make significant mistakes. According to a friend of mine this would require playing in a manner similar to a, uh, type of primate perhaps. Are we positive government labs aren't forcing caged primates to boost players?  Other times people purposely afk when the game is easily winnable due to anger or lack of game knowledge/willingness to play it out. I understand that it is hard to say this situation it is okay and in this one it isn't, however the open mid policy of the korean servers is (to my knowledge) not present or as accepted in the NA servers and I wish it was more often utilized.\nI have no specific solution I deem fair so I will end this section here with this tirade.\n\n\n\n\n{{summoner:3}} **Final Words**{{summoner:3}} \n\nCurrently, even though honestly I probably shouldn't cause I personally have more fulfilling and useful ways to spend my time like planking, I will continue to play league due to all my fond memories over the years and my unbreakable addiction to it. However, I am disillusioned with certain aspects of the game and disappointed in the way they have been handled. Thank you for all the good times, I hope there will be many more. \n\nSincerely,\na Bonobo\n{{champion:62}}","replies":[{"poster":"BuffRangerWill","date":"2020-01-11T04:53:55.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"20 Game Chat Suspension Chat Log:\n(I got rid of my name before each statement and condensed the lines so it doesn't take up as much space)\n(Decided to organize by event to make it easier to read)\n\nGame 1\nIn-Game\n\n***Start of Game***\nBuffRangerWill: we have no jg / no jg = lose / i am not your friend / you did not run this by us  \n\n**Support Stealing Blue and threatening to report me**\nopen mid / janna stole blue from me / you ed it / amumu and janna trolling / had to jg cause mumu went top and janna purposely took blue with e / at 40 hp / that is not what reporting is for \n\n**Trying to figure out how to 2 man top**\n i cant afford sp item yet / let me take caster minions / yes / are you sup or me mumu \n\n**Talon afking and threatening to report me**\n chill / i last hit under turret / chill / report talon feeding / i took 4 minions form under turret and last hit 2 more since he wasnt there / yeah it was close /\n\n**Explaining to enemy team why they shouldn't report me/trying to surrender**\n no / i was top / i went jg cause mumu didnt take smite / janna stole blue from me / only report talon / thats it / fun times / open mid / just run it down / janna stole blue on purpose but you dont need to report / me and aph are the only ones who didnt troll / how are you triggered by me / im sup in my own lane currently / you did / let them take it mumu / exactly / thats why it is troll / you do now / take mid ww  \n\n**Janna refusing to surrender for \"Revenge\"**\ngg wp / nvm janna said no / gg wp / report janna and talon / i have no trolled once / i had my blue buff stolen, my lane stolen / but report me for no reason / literally / talon afk / janna steal blue and troll / dont report mumu / he actually is trying / unlike janna / im sup in my own lane that i called / thats not the point / the point is we dont want janna on your or my team in the future / she is holding us hostage / after trolling / we cant surrender without 4 / exactly / defend yourself by keeping us in this game / for no reason / ????? / end / we open / report talon and janna / gg wp / i agree / why play after 15 /","replies":[{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2020-01-11T05:11:45.747+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If these are the complete, unedited chat logs ~~(I would still very much like to see a screenshot, not an edited version of them)~~ they still contain problematic elements.\n\n**Edit: typed this comment as you posted the unedited chat logs, ignore the first part.**\n\n- Asking for reports is against the rules as it only takes one report to trigger a game for automatic review and serves no purpose other than to put down another player.\n\n- Repeatedly saying things like \"ggwp\", \"why play after 15\", \"we open\", et cetera isn't helpful and falls under the Griefing/Giving Up category.\n\n- Arguing in all chat or refusing to drop a situation is disruptive, especially when saying things like \"we don't want Janna on either team\" and  \"she is trolling\"/\"holding us hostage.\"","replies":[{"poster":"BuffRangerWill","date":"2020-01-11T05:25:58.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Thank you for commenting.\n\n1.

The system handles false reports pretty well, my beef with it- it can't comprehend context. Beyond that, you are now aware of the expectations, which means the system worked on you. I don't really like it either, but until new standards are accepted, the bot, which has had its standards established by the players through their reports and honors, is the non-specific standard bearer. The parental lock feature would scarcely be recognized, and few parents if any would call their kid a liability for chat and would be far more likely to disable the chat entirely, which is currently a feature. Which the child could easily unlock anyway. There is also an AFK system in place- LeaverBuster- that is sitting where it should- more strict will punish those that don't deserve it, which is extremely upsetting if you're a victim of it undeservedly. You don't even have a proposal to do better there.

However you can take it as an insult if you like :D.","replies":[{"poster":"CharDeeMcDenniz","date":"2020-01-11T05:44:59.455+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"calling people who dont feel like reading your pile of drivel \"biologically indisposed\" is 100% an insult, im glad karma caught up to you","replies":[{"poster":"BuffRangerWill","date":"2020-01-11T05:54:23.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Originally was going to say biologically inclined, I can still change it back if you think it is funnier syntax.\nEdit: Just realized I accidentally made a k instead of a c, the joke may be funny yet.\n\nHonestly I have no experience with posting on League message boards so I wasn't sure how in depth to make it. If you have any enemies you need me to take care of I can send them my unedited longer 1st version draft.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-01-11T05:32:29.816+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hahahah... I blame current politically correct standards, where having a biological disposition about something gives you justification to be an exception. I'd like to see that be used as defense in court.

I added summaries of the games from both my restrictions to showcase my recent league experience as well as provide background for what I think is acceptable to be restricted for. I then decided to discuss my specific complaints as well as provide solutions in the hope that I could be contributing something to the community instead of just complaining about it. After adding some jokes and cutting the second draft in half I posted this masta piece. \n\nI could have postponed submitting this to do more research about already proposed solutions as well as proofread my draft a third time. However, I wanted to post something quick enough to get some answers about my 20 game restriction before I continued playing as well tell my opinions about certain current policies that annoy me to the community.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BuffRangerWill","date":"2020-01-11T06:52:07.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For those interested my support ticket listed my reason for the 20 game chat suspension as : Players have reported you 7 times in the past 20 games for negative or abusive behaviors in chat - in human terms, this means giving up on games, griefing your fellow players, and generally being difficult to play with over a large number of matches and teammates.\n\nThis accounts for the trolls from the 3 games I listed as well as a premade who wasn't happy with me testing some off meta supports haha. I appreciate all (all) your comments and assistance. Have a nice day mates\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
