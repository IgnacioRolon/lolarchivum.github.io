The boards represented a small % of the overall league community so it was difficult to say if the community itself preferred soloq over dynamic q and now we have a clearer picture of what the community in general thinks about dynamic queue.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I want to point out the flaws in Riot&#039;s arguments. They said that there were indeed games where 5 man premades were vsing 5 man solo players. That itself is already incredibly unhealthy. Then they said the 5 man premades would be grouped against 5 solo players in a way that it would be an equal chance for both teams to win. But they are completely overlooking so many factors. Not every premade is using voice chat in every game. How could they possibly balance around that? Then the guy on the premade that is getting carried decides to soloq and he ruins the games for his next few teams because the system has decided that he is really good because he got carried. This is one of the biggest arguments against boosting in the first place.\r\n\r\nAnd let&#039;s not forget about the fact that smurfing and boosting weren&#039;t even addressed in the first place. Both are a huge problem in lower elos. I personally smurf boost my friends all the time so it might be hypocritical of me to say but hey, the system allows it. These friends that I&#039;m boosting clearly don&#039;t deserve their rank because when they try to play on their own, they get demoted. \r\n\r\nAnd finally, Riot says that the new ranked system judges your teamwork more than individual skill. Did they think teamwork was not a key component in soloq? You were pitted with 3-4 randoms and you had to work together to beat the other team. Now there are situations where a 5 man soloq are vsing premades where the premade inherently has the advantage because they already have the aspect of teamwork down with each other while the soloq players are still left to figure out how to work together.\r\n\r\nAm I going crazy here","replies":[{"poster":"Dr W","date":"2016-06-01T00:01:33.401+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sad day for league.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leblancster","date":"2016-05-31T23:29:30.082+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot Socrates is a bonafide liar and moron.","replies":[{"poster":"AramsAreBest","date":"2016-06-01T15:23:13.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Do you ever stop crying","replies":[{"poster":"eastcoastblaze","date":"2016-06-01T15:42:24.175+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn look at this hardo.
