There may be some other hardware or driver issues that might be causing these crashes, and not necessarily game files.  I'd like to help out more, but I need some more information.  Does this crash happen as soon as you log in and do you receive any error messages?  Does the client appear at all?  What are you observing exactly?  Looking forward to helping out!","replies":[{"poster":"Twin Wolves","date":"2016-07-29T02:30:26.235+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im having the same issue. Started two or three days ago. The game only crashes after champ select when I enter the loading screen. The loading screen pops up in fullscreen and only displays a black background and my curser. After waiting for some time nothing happens until I tab out. The I see a message on the client saying that my game has crashed and too reconnect. When I hit reconnect Its the same black screen and curser again. Logging in and everything prior to starting a match works fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlobbyCatN","date":"2017-08-12T17:14:44.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My client is crashing right before i can even log in.

And not a SINGLE person has had anyone fix the problem tell them how to fix the problem or get their leaver buster taken away. Quite frankly it's ridiculous that Riot even still has that system implemented considering all the problems that come with it, or if they want to keep the system extend the time frame since it is THEIR fault that we keep crashing on THEIR system.","replies":[]}]}
