Not that I blame my adc for last game, their ping was on a constant 400 so that speaks for itself. But my issue is that the rest of my team were flaming both of us, even though my adc would constantly ping their ping and, as a {{champion:37}} , I don't know what else I could've done as my adc died pre-6 twice.\n\nI tried to roam to mid and get vision down, but my adc died soon after I left. At this point, our top and mid agree on a \"adc/support difference\" and I then felt completely lost on what to do. I won't lie and say that I feel extremely petty as they never gave me actual answers to what else I could really do to help.\n\nThis wouldn't apply to only Sona I'm sure, same would go for Janna, Soraka, etc. If me and my adc lose lane what else can I do to make an actual impact? Our _laning_ phase ended with me being 0/1 and my adc 0/3, and once I began roaming I ended up 0/4. So again, is there much else I can do after a disastrous lane as an enchanter support? If needed, I'm talking about my most recent game.","replies":[{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2019-10-15T05:35:31.232+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"buy a change class token and become a sorcerer. it's probably your best bet. just have your summoned pets collect the materials for you and pay someone to enchant things for you. it's not worth grinding the heavy enchanter class mountains because you sacrifice too much to be able to survive on your own in those high level dungeons.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2019-10-15T07:02:12.498+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Remain calm, its going to happen don't let it blow your mentality out the window.  Imo players who think they need all 4 teammates to be not just equal but superior to the enemy counterparts to win are oblivious to the fact that it strongly implys they are dead weight on a team.\n\nFor lane try to tell if its cuz your ADC is weak or just gave up after a few deaths. Soft inting behaviors are sadly very common atm with folks just going thru the motion of playing to avoid getting nailed with a leave buster punishment.\n\nLook to identify who is useful on your team that's playing for a win. Work around them primarily in fights. Depending on your comp Aim for all around helpful support items like {{item:3107}}  or aim to get some damage to compensate if that's needed. \n\nI like Sona powercord for damage reduction as it can really destroy some ones damage pattern if they don't expect it, most folks I see pretty much only ever spam the Q powercord for more damage.\n\nAim to Target the teammates who will pull weight, and aim to interfere with the enemy who pulls weight. A lot of folks burn spells just because they see a target. Do you really need to R their front line instantly, or can you hold onto it and use the threat of the ability to keep some of their back line farther away.  {{item:3107}} RWQE is a lot stronger then {{item:3504}} W when your most helpful teammates are not auto reliant.\n\nBe ready to adjust your build on a game to game to match game to game needs. \n\nYou don't have to CS, so you can communicate. I try to get ADC's to focus on their next item power spike or coordinate help with mid or jungle.  Don't be overly chatty as that's gonna result in a lot of back and forth chatter between teamamtes you don't want.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-10-15T04:51:10.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"You can lose the game. Not really any options if you play a champion with no ability to carry or function without a strong ally. Playing enchanters in soloqueue just means you are flipping a coin on the game being 3v5 instead of 4v5.\n\nIn the case of Sona specifically, you identify that your ADC is a boosted gibbon early, get a lichbane, and go on a cheesing spree while you leave them to scream abuse from botlane between respawns.","replies":[]}]}
