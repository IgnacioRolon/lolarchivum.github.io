I realized that the battery is drained so I charged it. When I got back to log myself back in and get back into action, there was a warning saying that there's a penalty for leaving the game and I need to type in \"I agree\" to continue. I did and the OK button doesn't work. What is going on? What should I do?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-22T16:49:32.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Might be a disconnect so your response can't be received by the server.
