When the main screen pops up I can use everything, including buying from the store, except actually clicking on the Play button. After about 20 sec it tells me that it is 'trying to reconnect'. When it is doing this I can still receive messages from friends as if i was online. I have been trying to fix this for about a week now and nothing seems to work. PLEASE HELP......\n\nEdit: The legacy client doesn't even start, says I have an http error but I cant find a solution that works.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-26T00:52:00.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Between the play button not working, the \"trying to reconnect\" message and the Legacy Client not starting, I'd say it's very likely there are issues on your network preventing you from reaching our servers properly.
