Even if you were able to return to the legacy client, there is a chance that you might see a crash expectantly.  I'd rather you be safe than sorry in this case, so when you get a chance I'd recommend a [reinstall](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends).  This will get you back to the standalone legacy client.  You can then re-download the updated client from there.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
