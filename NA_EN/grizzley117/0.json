It's a small thing, but Rito has set the precedent with other 2nd and 3rd time winners with a description that mentions previous their previous worlds wins. For example, SKT T1 Nami reads \"Honoring Wolf's winning performance as Nami during the 2016 World Championship. This is Wolf's second World Champion skin, following his win with SKT at the 2015 World Championship.\" Considering Duke is the only world champion that has won World's with two different organizations, I think it would be appropriate to continue the trend of honoring previous wins!\r\n\r\nSo, it would read \"Honoring Duke's winning performance as Irelia during the 2018 World Championship. This is Duke's second World Champion skin, following his win with SKT at the 2016 World Championship.\" A simple change, but would be much appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2019-05-08T19:06:16.443+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure, I'll do that now.
