Originally we had not accounted for players who may have special characters in their computer username (e.g. D@NK M3M3S). We've fixed this particular issue so that it works with all usernames. While we understand this may be a hassle, youâ€™ll need to [download a fresh version of the app](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/league-displays) from and perform a clean install.\n\nIf this doesn't work, let us know and we'll try and work through this with you!
