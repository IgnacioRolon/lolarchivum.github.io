Sustain isn't enough till later, but he IS better now.\nAli: Forget it.\nMumu: Hard AF early, but once you get a few levels he's fine. Will be invaded 10x more than he is now though.\nCho: Nope. Can't survive early.\nDiana: Pending Test, sorry...\nMundo: Terrible clear speed. Terrible time living. Easy AF to invade.\nElise: Clear speeds bad. Requires management of spiderlings now or you're fked.\nEve: Can't jungle anymore. I mean it.\nFiddlesticks: One of only 2 champs that can actually jungle properly.\nFiora: Nope.\nGP: Hahaha I just tried for da lolz, died to blue first clear.\nGragas: Nope.\nHecarim: Really bad early. Like, REALLY REALLY bad. But he can do it at later levels.\nDonger: Actually fairly decent... Place turrets so you can kill both Wight and Blue and you're set. I could actually see this being a decent pick because he's one of few that isn't free FB if found at 3:00.\nJ4: Holy crap he's terrible. Wouldn't know he was meant to jungle if I hadn't played live.\nJax: Pretty decent actually, survives blue and has quickish clear speeds, can see him being a top counterjungler.\nKayle: No.\nKhazix: Hard early, once you hit 4 you're just as OP as live.\nLee Sin: Blahh.... he's ok. Terrible clear speed tho.\nMalph: Mana issues worse than ever.\nMaokai: He's OK... once you hit lv 4.\nYi: Another counterjungler. Free FB early.\nNasus: No.\nNautilus: Terrible. Can't jungle anymore.\nNidalee: Nope.\nNocturne: Decent. Fairs better than most in terms of survivability, and I can see him up there with Jax as a counterjungler.\nNunu: Only jungler besides Fiddlesticks that can keep over 50% hp.\nOlaf: No.\nPantheon: Another \"trash-till-4\"\nRammus: Probably third only to Nunu and Fiddle\nRengar: Pretty shit.\nRiven: Not even close.\nSejuani: Go back to... oh wait. Yea rework #2 plz.\nShaco: Trash cuz stupid wall keeps me in base so I can't lv 1 invade.\nShen: Back to top lane for you buddy.\nShyvana: Difficult, not impossible.\nSkarner: Better than I thought, worse than he should be\nTrundle: Why is trundle failing in the jungle?\nTryndamere: Ahahahahahaha died to red.\nUdyr: Rammus level.\nVi: Pretty bad\nVolibear: Relies solely on passive.\nWW: I was wrong about rammus this guy's third.\nWK: Back to top lane you go.\nWin Nhao: Needs 4.\nZac: Trash. Worse than live.\n\n\nEDIT: I have not tried multiple paths for everyone. If you know of a good path for someone I listed as crap, please post it so I can try it and update!","replies":[]}
