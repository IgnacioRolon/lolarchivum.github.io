{"poster":"S0NA","date":"2014-10-17T04:13:17.977+0000","title":"LeBlanc: She's deceived even Riot","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"LeBlanc, {{champion:7}}, the Deceiver, infamous for her legendary burst and for her recently removed Sigil of Silence, has fooled many a player into attacking her clone.\r\n\r\nYou know the frustration it invokes when you flash-ignite and get... +25g.\r\n\r\nBut even though we all know this about LeBlanc, we all know she's a liar, we all know she's out to deceive us, we are all deceived by this sorceress.\r\n\r\nI mean, she even says it herself for crying out loud: \"Lying is, like, 95% of what I do.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSo let me ask you, what image comes to mind when you think of LeBlanc?\r\n\r\nProbably that image I put at the top:\r\n\r\n{{champion:7}}\r\n\r\nBut that's not her.\r\n\r\nOh no.\r\n\r\nThat's the clone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLook at her art (I've attached it)\r\n\r\nBut you don't even need to do that. That LeBlanc in the picture is standing straight and tall, facing down her opponent.\r\n\r\nLolwut?\r\n\r\nThat idea is laughable. This is a liar, a cheat, a deceiving, teleporting, stealthy sorceress. She's not, say, Garen. She would NEVER fight face front like this.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat her real image should be I've outlined in the art I attached.\r\n\r\nThis should really be changed. LeBlanc is unique (as far as I can tell) in that she's the ONLY champion in League whose face ingame is not her real face. It's the clone, aka \"Mirror Image\" aka a reflection. This might seem like a minor point, but when it's portraying a champion as exactly the opposite of what their identity is, I don't think we should overlook it.\r\n\r\nFix please Riot!","replies":[{"poster":"Leroyswish","date":"2014-10-17T17:41:28.262+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This doesn't require a fix, though it is a neat read.
