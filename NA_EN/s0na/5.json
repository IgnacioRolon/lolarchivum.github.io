I lost all 10 promos on a smurf, it put me in Bronze II.\n\nIt then proceeded to give me 45 LP for a win, and only -20 for a loss.\n\nWithout outright FEEDING, I'd have to lose more than 2/3 of my games to fall. I was playing shit like AD malzahar, or picking Fiora into Pantheon and then not farming at ALL, and I still could easily outplay these guys and slaughter them. I mean, I was AD malz and the enemy had this super fed 8-0 J4. I easily wrecked him 1v1.\n\nDon't ask me how anyone died to this moron because I just kitied him out until he flash-ulted me under my own tower.\n\nWhat goes through these peoples minds? I mean, this is B2. Can someone give me advice on how the hell I can possibly drop further? I really want to get an acc to B5 for the lulz. And I'd rather not feed like hell to do it.","replies":[]}
