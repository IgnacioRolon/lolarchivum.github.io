You have to win lane because late game you haven&#039;t got the mobility to stay safe and you aren&#039;t as strong as, let&#039;s say a kog&#039;maw or Jinx who similarly don&#039;t have dashes and blinks. Late game you lay down some AOE goodness and hope no one jumps on your face.\n\nSo with that in mind, here&#039;s what I would have done to the MF rework to help her out with some of her issues:\n\n**_Passive; Strut_**\n**What it does now**\nIt&#039;s a great tool to help MF get to a fight or back into lane.\n**What&#039;s wrong with it?**\nNothing really, this is about getting to a fight / chasing your bounty so it fits thematically with MF. Could it be better? Yes, but I wouldn&#039;t want to push her into being OP so I like the changes they made to it.\n**What I&#039;d change**\nI&#039;d give Strut a scaling value at levels 1/6/11/16 along with the ult.\nSomething along the lines of: _This bonus movement scales up to a maximum of 25/50/75/100_\n**Why is this a good change?**\nEarly game it&#039;s a nerf, which I know is bad since I myself said MF is a lane bully and needs to win her early game.\nLate game strut is rarely ever up during team fights, but the increased movement speed helps MF get to the key objectives such as dragon/baron and towers which is good. \nAlso if you continue reading my suggested change to W : Impure shots goes very nicely with this scaling move speed from strut. \n\n**_Q : Double Up_**\n**What it does now**\nIt&#039;s her bread and butter skill, everyone max&#039;s this first because it&#039;s that good. It fits her thematically and helps identify her as a lane bully being able to poke you through minions.\n**What I would change**\nIf MF falls behind in lane, she&#039;s gonna be in trouble later in the game. So any MF player that falls behind tends to use Double-Up as a farming skill. When they&#039;re ahead they use it to poke for easy damage. \nI&#039;d add the following:_ Every kill scored by double up reduces the cooldown by 1 second. _\n**Why would this be a good change?**\nIf you&#039;re ahead with MF this change won&#039;t affect you, you&#039;re using Q to poke the enemy champion which won&#039;t kill it. In late game teamfights your double up usually won&#039;t kill anything there either, you&#039;re using it between auto attacks to maintain higher dps. But in that last scenario where you&#039;re behind as MF using this skill to get farm, it&#039;s now off cooldown far more frequently helping a good MF last hit caster minions which would otherwise be out of range. \nIt&#039;s a nice buff to her ahead/late game as well by shaving off 1 second of cooldown, but it&#039;s most noticeable when MF is behind using it to last hit creeps to take 2 seconds off the cooldown. As a character meant to win lane I think giving her the tools to stay in the game when she doesn&#039;t is a nice touch. \n\n**_W : Impure Shots_**\n**What it does now**\nIt&#039;s MF&#039;s steroid. Every ad needs one and this provides her bonus magic damage on hit along with the potential to activate it for attack speed.\n**What&#039;s wrong with it?**\nThe new change seems interesting on paper, cast W to activate strut, nice. In practice however it never really ends up working that well. As MF if you&#039;re using W to gain attack speed you (hopefully) aren&#039;t getting hit yet so you already had strut anyway. You want to use this at the start of the teamfight to maximize your damage before the enemies jump on you. If however you&#039;re saving this in order to regain strut/using it to try and escape, well it&#039;s usually too late. You&#039;re squishy and in attack range already, odds are you&#039;ll regain strut only to lose it immediately. If someone peels for you, you&#039;ve committed to running from the fight and are losing out on your steroid. It&#039;s a conflict between the 2 parts of the ability where 1 is offensive in nature and the other is defensive. This conflict results in the player never (except for very rare scenarios) getting the most value out of their skill.\n**What I&#039;d change**\nSlightly rework the new effect of Impure Shots to focus it more on the aggressive nature of a steroid ability.\nChange the wording to: _When impure shots is active, Miss Fortune gains the strut movement speed bonus while moving towards affected enemy champions._\n**Why would this be a good change?**\nIt no longer gives MF the option to run with her W, instead re-purposing it entirely as an aggressive skill. It helps the bounty hunter theme of Miss fortune where she has a target and she is hunting it down. By giving MF her passive movespeed while moving towards any targets she&#039;s hit she can mark and hunt weakened enemies after a fight. This movement speed buff is also phrased in such a way that it&#039;s not giving MF strut which can easily be taken away, rather it&#039;s only granting her move speed while hunting her target. This means you can chase an enemy even if their minions/towers/allies are hitting you, things which would normally remove strut&#039;s movement speed bonus. It also leaves plenty of room for counter play since MF has no escape, if she&#039;s hunting your team-mates down using impure shots then her team has either A)already won the fight, or B)is putting herself into a very bad position to get them.\n\nI'd even toy with the idea of giving Miss Fotune vision of marked targets to help her hunt, it would fit the bounty hunter theme, but vision is a strong thing to give someone. Might push this skill into OP territory.\nAnd while I'm on impure shots, it needs some indicator to show how many stacks are on each champ. (I like CatSaber's suggestion of a heart that fills up as she builds stacks on a champion). \n\n**_E : Make It Rain_**\n**What it does now**\nIt&#039;s MF&#039;s worst skill, I was seriously hoping this would get reworked/changed completely. But since it hasn&#039;t I&#039;m here to share my thoughts on what could have been. \n**The problem**\nMake it rain just has so many things going against it, the biggest one being that it has a cast animation and tickles enemies. Seriously, I&#039;m sure any MF players can vouch for me when I say it&#039;s common to see make it rain deal something like 15 damage to an enemy. It&#039;s just not worth casting it for damage and instead is used entirely for it&#039;s slow. Which is nice that they&#039;ve buffed the early slow, but there&#039;s more they could&#039;ve done for this skill.\n**What I&#039;d change**\nBecause I like the idea of make it rain (thematically) I wouldn&#039;t swap it to an entirely new skill. Instead I&#039;d change it into a line skill shot, similar to Viktor&#039;s death ray. Now why would I do this? \nWell: 1)It front loads the damage. (enemies accidentally stepping into it are going to feel the hurt.)\n2)By making it a line shot instead of a round area, the skill can be given more range, allowing for more harrassment in lane/farming minions from a safe range if you&#039;ve fallen behind.\n3)This really helps her early game lane bully feel by allowing her to mix in a make it rain into her combo to help burst. It might even make players rank it up to level 2 or 3 before deciding to max impure shots. \n\nNext I&#039;d also change how the skill levels. Instead of just being 1 line of bullets with plenty of damage, I&#039;d change it to shooting additional waves of bullets every time the skill is levelled. What does this do you might ask?\nWell: 1)It allows for counter play, if we were to front load all the damage of MF&#039;s make it rain right now it would hit like a truck which isn&#039;t good. So by adding additional waves instead of damage when the skill is levelled we&#039;re giving enemies a chance to get out of the AoE before the next wave strikes. \n2)By giving the skill additional waves we&#039;re increasing the duration that the skill remains in play for. This is useful because late game MF can now use make it rain as a slow in narrow chokes and have it last longer than her current 2 second AoE while also doing more damage (because once again we&#039;ve front loaded the damage on the waves so the average case will have enemies taking more damage than the current live version where they can escape after 1/2 ticks.). \n\nSo her new E would look like this:\nMiss Fortune rains 1/2/3/4/5 waves of bullets down in a line, which begin landing after a 0.5-second delay. Each wave will fire 0.5 seconds after the previous wave has finished dealing 60 +0.1Bonus AD +0.8AP Magic damage. Enemies in the area of effect are slowed 40/45/50/55/60.\n\nThe overall damage is roughly the same as her current Make it rain deals: 90/145/200/255/310 +0.8AP where this version deals 60*5 waves=300 +0.8AP. And I&#039;ve given it a +0.1 bonus AD ratio to help compensate on the final 10 damage at the highest level. \n\n**Why this is a good change**\nIn lane this 60burst damage will greatly help MF in trades despite being less damage than the current 90damage at level 1, but the more points you put into it the less reward you will get since enemies can easily leave the slow before the next wave strikes. Late game the new change actually causes the AoE slow to remain on the field longer which can help MF and her team hunt down kills or escape. By changing the shape of the skill into a line we can also make it larger allowing MF to use it in more choke points if angled properly. \n\n**R : Bullet Time**\n**What it does now**\nWhat it does now is make MF the best Wombo Combo ADC there is and she gets to laugh while doing it.\nIt&#039;s one of the best tools she has for late game letting her hit the entire enemy team from a long range which is something she desperately needs, because as I&#039;ve said so many times, if she gets caught, she&#039;s done for late game. You have 0 escapes.\n**What I&#039;d change in this skill**\nNothing. Seriously, MF is doing fine with this skill let&#039;s not change anything and risk ruining/breaking it. Sure we could tweak numbers and scaling but that&#039;s not what I&#039;m interested in with this post. I&#039;m interested in the mechanics of MF&#039;s skills, and mechanically/thematically, this skill is awesome. \n\n**Other**\nNow here's the thing, in all the above stuff I've been mentioning interesting mechanics to give MF an identity and better niche, but there's another problem that she has, and it's been said so many times, I'm just going to say it here as that extra hit on the dead horse; fix her scaling, And that's all I'm gonna say about it because I don't really care to discuss theoretical numbers, without testing it's almost impossible to make numbers end up balanced so just, yeah. \n\n**Suggestions/credit**\nLeu07: I like his idea of Make It Rain triggering impure shots instead of a +0.1bonus AD since this could help her setup for a stronger ult late game and give her a stronger poke in lane due to being able to stack her shots faster. I'd have to tone down Make it Rain's base damage to compensate however. Since this would only trigger when the waves of bullet strike however (using my version of the skill) I don't see the damage needing to be completely eliminated as he suggested. \n\n**Tl/Dr**\nStrut: Scale maximum move speed at ranks 1/6/11/16\nQ: Reduce cooldown by 1 second for each target killed (helps her farm when behind, doesn&#039;t really help her when ahead)\nW: Gain Strut move speed bonus while moving towards enemies hit by impure shots. Bonus only applies while Impure Shots is active and cannot be removed by taking damage/anything else that would normally remove strut. \nE: Turn it into a line skill shot which shoots in waves instead of a constant AoE. Allows for better burst early and a longer lasting AoE slow late.\nR: Don&#039;t touch it, the skill is fine thematically, of course number tweaks and scaling changes would be nice though","replies":[{"poster":"Axhliay","date":"2015-07-29T01:43:41.129+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was toying with the idea that MF Q should be like a miniature Graves Ultimate.

I'm thinking that instead of being a line skill shot (like Viktor's or Rumbles I pressume?), Why not make it a rectangular, wall-like AoE? Because Viktor's and Rumble's lines skillshots are something an ADC would have a hard time using given that their positioning is so goddamn important, and this is also MF's zoning tool\n\nI'm thinking possibly make the AoE constant slow, yet the waves \"rain down\" in intervals. Also, instead of an AD ratio, why not add impure shots to the damage formula? it makes more sense given that two of her other skills apply impure shots and she needs impure shots stacks to access her damage potential?","replies":[{"poster":"k5y7Qmf4oX","date":"2015-07-28T18:56:13.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah shape / range of her E would be something I'd have fun tinkering with if I could, but sadly I don't work for riot :P Personally I've never had a hard time landing Viktor / Rumble style line skillshots while maintaining position and I think that style of cast gives it great range but I can see how yours would work as well (if I understand the way you're explaining it, wall style like Anivia/Yasuo). Either way would be pretty cool so long as the range is there for zoning / blocking key positions. I just like the line for the versatility of how you can position it. \n\nAlso it was poorly worded in mine, but yes I would have the slow be in the area while the damage only ticked occasionally. You wouldn't need to be hit in order to be slowed. \n\nI do really like the idea of giving Make It Rain some impure shots interaction though the damage on Make it Rain would need to be scaled back a bit to compensate I think, since Impure shots deals 6% bonus ad and it would also translate to more damage on her ult / auto attacks even Make it Rain itself due to the stacking nature of impure. Maybe 45 damage per wave instead of 60 as a random number from the top of my head just so she doesn't get too much early burst damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-07-28T19:03:45.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd remove the base damage component completely, because it would ramp up with AD anyways up to 36%-48% and it WOULD glue her kit together by adding more stacks for ulti and AAs, so having it do more damage would make the skill OP and a priority.\n\nAnd yeah I was thinking something similar to Anivia's wall, but with Varus's E range or something, or maybe just a rectangle with the pretty hearts they added to the visuals since it wouldn't \"grow\" as you level it up.\n\nAlso, don't you think impure shots need some clarity?

Make it rain would turn into a complete utility tool and zone control, I don't think it needs that much damage really. Mechanically speaking, if this Make it rain ever sees the light of game or we get a Red's attention, Placing a good make it rain before ulting would hurt anyone ALOT, because you'd have two skills stacking up impure shots onto your targets, maxing out your ult's damage sooner. It would make sense to actually cast both skills in succession, giving MF a very \"shock and awe\" factor to her wombo. \n\nIn lane, this Make it rain would enable an easier double up bounce, since apparently the bounce prioritizes targets with impure shots stacks over champions. It would be even better if it prioritized champions with impure shots stacks on them before any other target. It would give her more prescense in lane.\n\nIt would be a very \"if you dare to cross this area, things WILL go south-ways for you\" skill\n\nBut we're just throwing theories around anyways :P","replies":[{"poster":"k5y7Qmf4oX","date":"2015-07-29T03:07:18.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For sure, sounds interesting.

It's a pretty confusing ultimate that's kinda hard to itemize if you're playing either ap or ad mf.\n\nanother thing that i could add is: make it strut to not be interrupted after lvl 11 by minions, it's sad when a caster minion with a single attack cancels it..","replies":[{"poster":"k5y7Qmf4oX","date":"2015-07-28T19:19:52.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely understand that ult scaling being messed up. And it is. But the thing with numbers is that I'm never going to get them right just through theory crafting, it's something that takes a lot of time and testing to get right, so for my post I wanted to stick entirely to discussing mechanics of skills over how they scale. But yeah I 100% fully agree that her ult scales just....stupidly lol.\n\nAs for the minions cancelling her passive. I know it can be frustrating but for myself I can see why Riot does it the way it's being done. It gives the passive weaknes. It keeps you from being able to be too aggressive since MF is a lane bully and has the potential to dominate early, you don't want her to be able to zone enemy champs completely while keeping her passive intact. If she's on the wrong side of the minions then she should be an easy gank, so having the minions be able to cancel her passive, I think, makes her have to think more carefully about her positioning. \n\nFor me the minions resetting your passive makes you have to think more carefully before jumping into any lane or fight because it risks cancelling your passive as well. You might want to go push bot lane, but the enemy is grouping for baron, with your bonus 100 move speed you can make it up there with time to spare, but pushing bot lane you now risk losing your passive speed. More decision about having to choose which fight you take and ensures that MF never gets too cocky and starts diving people, that's my opinion on the cancelled passive anyway.\n\n+with the new impure shots interaction I suggested having it get cancelled by minions isn't as big of a deal if you're trying to use it aggressively anyway, it just makes sure you're vulnerable to a gank once you decide to dive the enemy team.","replies":[]}]}]}
