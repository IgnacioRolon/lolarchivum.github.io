People notice improvements when they focus on CS or Vision, because these are much easier to control, and excellence in these areas will excuse underperformance in other areas.\n\n\n\nIt is said that Vision is %20 of your grade. This is an oversimplification, however, it's amazing that when you tell this to people, they start warding, and they start getting Ses.\n\nRiot's grading is NOT consistent with good game play. For example, in the long match, you would need to farm past 400 CS to still earn an S, in most cases, and this is ridiculous.

If the average CS for your champ is, say 200 cs at 35 minutes (totally and completely doable), then you have to get say 250 by 35 minutes. If their average KDA is 4.0, you gotta get a 5.0. ALL of those points (including warding score) have to be above the average for your region in order for you to get an S. Some champs are a lot harder than others. Lucian is staggeringly difficult to get an S on compared to someone like Azir or Yorick. The more players who use the champ, the more stable the average becomes, and usually the harder it is to rank highly","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sona Ping","date":"2019-09-09T02:26:39.003+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TeodorusofNoxus,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=hrGjiIyX,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-09-09T02:21:13.855+0000)\n>\n> Despite the title, no this is not a rant.

Just put down one pink in a spot where they won't find it, but is still useful. The VS is calculated roughly based on how minutes you had how much of the board lit up, with extra points for useful locations. Buying 5 pinks doesn't give much more VS than just having one well-placed. (And if the enemy is taking out your wards, then, probably, less.)\n\nInstead, upgrade to Farsight at lvl 9. If it makes any sense at all, then get a ZZ'rot portal, and make sure that it's always deployed.\n\nYour VS is visible to you in-game. Turn it into a kind of mini-game, trying to get the highest score possible. If your jungler won't take the scuttler down, then you take it. Hit the scryers every time. Whenever there's a ward in your inventory, find a good spot to put it down.\n\n(Not all of this is good advice for winning, but it's not BAD, and you should learn something from doing this, besides.
