If you're had chat restrictions before, it's ban worthy \n\nFeeding isn't against the rules. Being bad or getting counterpicked etc isn't against the rules. Having a bad game isn't against the rules\nWhy should the kaisa be punished for having 1 bad game? Looking at their match history, they play well in most of their games\n\nYou went 0/11 in a game, 4/10, 5/11. With your logic you should get banned for those games\n\nYou were toxic, you broke the rules, so you deserve the punishment\nJust because someone is having a bad game, doesn't mean you're allowed to flame them. And if you do flame them, they 100% should be allowed to report your toxic ass","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-02-06T22:43:10.837+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, that's definitely a toxic chat log worthy of a punishment.

There are many reasons that players may ban hovered champions. There is a difference between feeding and intentionally feeding. The first is not punishable, the second is.
