He doesnt really need buffs or big changes (unlike for example cass) with his 47% winrate and 3 % pickrate (op.gg) but i thought his ulti could be a little bit easier to hit (normally if you hit 2 out of 3 youre doing a good job) and more importantly - look more manacing and powerful.\r\n\r\nCompare his ult to the prereworked version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hypC5BhvPOM\r\n\r\nThese big blast zones with their aoe effect just look scary as hell! Im not saying it should have the same aoe (range after the rework is obviously bigger) but Xerath could use a tiny aoe and visual change at his ulti.\r\n\r\nThe Pew Pew Pew&#039;s can be super effective or do nothing, but they almost always look underwhelming. (which obviously goes against Xeraths unlimited power siege fantasy). What would be cool would be lightning striking down onto the area or something.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd lets be real: even if such a buff brings him back into competitiveness, he certainly is more fun to watch than a corki or a lulu.\r\n\r\nWhat are you guys thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2016-02-16T13:18:03.497+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunally they already said that this update will not include \"Artillery Mages\" (aka Lux, Ziggs and Xerath).

Honestly didnt expect a riot response :)!\n\nA few small changes are pretty cool and enough (like i said some ulti aoe buff should already do it honestly - i feel like xerath has a fine powerlevel with his other abilities. Its just very easy to miss the whole ulti, especially since a lot of champs are very mobile either with high MS or lots of dashes) but i just cant help but feel its more about the visuals.

This game's complexity creep is absolutely _massive_ - I've never seen a game have so much of it. Every single champion kit released in the past year is infinitely overloaded compared to the days of old, and while that may be fine for players who have been playing for years, this game does still have new players coming in. Annie is the absolute ideal, perfect champion for a new player interested in mages, with a simple but powerful kit that both makes last hitting easier and rewards it heavily with Q. Saying she's unhealthy for the game when she's rarely picked in high ELO and literally never, ever picked in competitive seems a little questionable - the issue isn't her, but rather you, if you can't beat her, as cleanly evidenced by the fact that skilled players do beat her.\n\nSaying that because you don't want to be bothered getting better to beat a champion that skilled players can beat, it should be reworked, removing a simple champion from the game in favor of Riot's new COMPLEXITY EVERYWHERE, is just nonsensical.","replies":[{"poster":"Xhieron","date":"2016-02-16T22:19:33.908+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Never picked? Where were you a season ago when she was pick or ban as support across all skill levels?\n\nAnnie is extremely unhealthy if we're using the same rubric we're using for every other champ in this class. She has exactly the same assassin-mage identity crisis issues Malzahar has, and he's on this list because of them. She's not, and the only reason I can come up with is that she drew a better straw.\n\nAnnie is a champ who can reliably stun on demand any time she has access to minions (or time if she doesn't), her combo involves zero counterplay (unless you count \"stay out of range or Flash\" as counterplay), and her pattern is extremely non-interactive for the Annie player, since the optimal strategy is frequently *not* to cast any spells.\n\nI'm not suggesting she should be made more complex, but simplicity is no more equivalent to game health than popularity, pick rate, or win rate.\n\nIf Mordekaiser is unhealthy, if Vlad is unhealthy, if Veigar is unhealthy, then Annie is unhealthy. She doesn't get to be a sacred cow just because you like her and don't want to see her neck on the block. Riot has made it crystal clear in the last few years that they do not approve of champs that can reliably 100 - 0 enemy champions from range without any risk of retaliation. If that doesn't describe Annie, I'm not sure what would.\n\nI won't pretend I'm not happy that other folks are now scared for their pet champs, but as someone who lost Mordekaiser and is soon to loose Vlad, Malz, and Brand in one fell swoop, it's a little liberating. If mages far less toxic than Annie are subject to the menacing eye of Riot, Annie will not be excluded. She may get a reprieve in the next few months because she survived the first ballot, but don't be under any delusions that that must mean she's healthy.","replies":[{"poster":"Son Jarvan","date":"2016-02-16T22:47:50.581+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm not talking about a season ago. I'm talking about _now._ The fact that she was once overpowered in the past has absolutely nothing to do with her kit being toxic or unhealthy for the game. \n\nI'm not sure where you get the idea that she's unhealthy because she has a reliable stun on a short cooldown (hello Twisted Fate!) or because she can 100-0 people from range without retaliation - plenty of mages can do that, and some from a larger range than Annie's unusually short 625 range on all of her spells. Much of the counterplay to her comes from that short range, and while Flash circumvents that and is the only thing that even makes her playable at all, Flash isn't off cooldown all the time.\n\nComparing her with Mordekaiser and Vladimir makes absolutely no sense. Vladimir's supposed unhealthiness comes from being a manaless champion with a sustain spell on short cooldown (which I don't really agree with, but is completely different from Annie). Mordekaiser's unhealthiness comes from his shield, where if he's strong enough to do real damage he's invincible and if he's not he does nothing, being at the extremes of feast or famine design.\n\nComparing her with Malzahar and Veigar, on the other hand, makes some level of sense. However, I disagree that Malzahar is actually unhealthy, and it does seem like he (and Vel'koz) mostly got picked by straws. Riot picking those two for reworks doesn't automatically mean they're actually unhealthy for the game. Veigar's rework completely killed the champion, that dude is a long forgotten pick who became irrelevant to League of Legends as soon as his numbers were tuned after the rework.\n\nI am sorry for your losses to Riot's menacing rework team, but I would like to have hope that they might learn from their mistakes and won't needlessly butcher Annie instead of butchering her because they also butchered other champions similar to her in the past.","replies":[{"poster":"Xhieron","date":"2016-02-16T23:57:46.428+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"How many changes has she seen in the intervening time? The kit's the same. Either it's toxic or not. Shaco, Evelynn, Twitch. Were you around for the stealth reworks? Those champs weren't overpowered, in Eve's case deliberately (and for about a year). It didn't make the mechanic not toxic.\n\nAnnie will get hers, and when she does, Teemo will laugh. Scorched earth is best earth.\n\nIf it's good for the goose (Malzahar), it's good for the gander (Annie). As I said, Riot has made their position clear. You want to talk about mages who can assassinate from range? Take a look around. They're dropping like flies. LB got her Silence taken away (along with Kass who, while technically melee, could still insta-gib people from range due to the silence-into-reposition). Ahri got nerfed (remember the wonky charm changes that they eventually reverted?) Hell, even Viktor got nerfed because his laser damage was too reliable.\n\nTake a look at your champion list. LB's the only ranged champ left on the assassin list. For mages, the writing's on the wall. Excluding people on the mid-year list, who's left on the mage list for ranged assassination? Lux, long overdue for nerfs, Ahri, Syndra, TF, and Annie. Syndra got her teeth kicked in last year, and why TF hasn't seen substantial changes despite a regular tradition of tournament spotlight is beyond me. Let's not forget, however, that even with a near-global teleport, it's almost impossible for TF to outright 100-0 someone during his stun. He's popular because he's able to port into help and pick targets or run people down.\n\nRiot's process for deciding which champs to butcher may be arcane and unpredictable, but if you think Annie's coming out unscathed, you haven't been watching the last two years of development.\n\nIt doesn't matter whether she's actually unhealthy. I don't really have a problem with Annie lanes (especially as someone who loves nothing better than to play Malz while I still can). What matters is whether she fits the profile, and she does. Do you really think Riot's going to create a game where Annie is going to be left alone as the mage who can 100-0 an enemy champ after landing a targeted stun while much more difficult, engaging champs get gutted?\n\nGet with the program. It isn't a question of whether Annie is going to get her turn. It's a matter of time. When she does, just hope you get as much time to make peace with it as the players of the 2016 Six.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2016-02-16T20:39:05.699+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Well your argument goes out the door when you remember they are reworking Malzahar because he the same game health issues as Annie... He is too strong when played well or not properly countered but almost completely useless when countered correctly. The difference is Annie is stronger with better teamfight than Malzahar. You also don't see Malzahar at higher elo because he is easy to counter. Anyone who complains about Malzahar simply doesn't know how to counter him, all you need to do is google it and you will pretty much never have issue with him (unless you are not facing him and your teammate feeds him). Annie is harder to deal with then he is though and her kit is twice as toxic thanks to her instant AoE nuke stun and extremely high damage.  \n\nBesides where did i say i had issue with Annie? I'm reading my comment and i am not seeing where i said anything about me not being able to deal with her or that i don't know what to do against her. All i said was her kit was toxic and had game health issues, which is true. Malzahar does too which is why he is getting a rework, she should get one soon.

Annie has an incredibly simplistic kit - three short range damage spells that all do the same thing, and a passive that enables a stun on one of them. \"Raw damage + a little CC\" on a mage is not inherently unhealthy for the game, it's as simple and normal as a kit can get, so the only way it'd be unhealthy is if you think she does too much damage. But if she genuinely did too much damage she would be an actual pick.","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2016-02-16T23:09:09.099+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well that is why they are reworking him also point click CC with no counterplay other than \"dont be in range\" is not healthy for the game, according to Riot.   \n\nMy issue with Annie is the only counterplay is the same as Malzahar's, don't be in range or hope they suck. Personally i don't have much issue dealing with her when i am laning against her, because a simple kit means simple counterplay, but when my team feeds her (and they always do) it becomes nearly impossible to do anything but be no where near her on the map. Her passive is fine but her Q being point and click and her ult being instant AoE is NOT HEALTHY GAME MECHANICS. Regardless of whether they are too strong or too weak, its just not healthy for the game. Same with Malzahars ult, its not too strong and if you think it is you have never played him, its not weak either but the nature of his ult is he either hits you and kills you or he fails and he is 90% useless. There needs to be a way to deal with Mobility Creep and Assassins, but Malzahar and Annie's kits are not the answer, or at least not the best answer. I play Malzahar, he is the only mage i play regularly and i love his kit but even i admit his kit has game health issues.
