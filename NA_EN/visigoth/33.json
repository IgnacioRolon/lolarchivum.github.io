So should bruisers.\n\nOne could argue that I am a mere Silver 5 Saltpile who hates assassins and wants them dead and gone, since I seem particularly biased due to not even playing assassins... But I'mma disprove that, because I KNOW Assassins are an important role. Assassins have a place in the game, even if I absolutely despise facing the likes of Talon and Yasuo. They also have a really fun fantasy to play; Sneaking around and flanking the enemy team, dispatching key targets in a split-second, then getting out. BUT!
