The patches influence what the meta becomes certainly. You are also correct in stating that broken stuff is discovered faster by the best players. You are also correct in stating that the meta would likely not change if their were no patch notes. However, Riot can't possible set down what people will actually play, their are just too many variables. For example, Riot never intended Warwick to be broken. They were trying to create a more diverse jungle meta. Instead the top players found out that Warwick with a particular item was horrible broken. In this case who is everyone emulating? Its the players. Another example, Riot discovered that mana regen was becoming problematic so they nerfed it across the board. What happened? The top player base discovered/theory crafted that manaless assassins would be good. People starting copying that. Who was everyone emulating?

The example of tele/smite is being attributed to -that- \"they\", meaning the \"pros\".  So again, *PLEASE*, keep your position internally consistent.

I believe that Riot has set the framework and the players have set the meta with in that framework. Specifically the top portion of the player base. Yours and manbearswine's opinion is that because Riot creates the framework that they inadvertently create meta's and the players just discover them. Functionally they are the same idea. I disagree with your opinion because I do not think that it is possible to create something as specific as a meta without intentionally doing so.

Even the best of the best can't fully control what they create, but they're the ones deciding and creating the shirt.  This is what I liken Riot's role to.  They're tie-dye shirt makers of a sort.  They put a rubber band here, a dip in blue dye there, and they're doing it intentionally, and for reasons, but the result is not 100% predictable, and sometimes, a shirt comes out wrong, but such is life.  Players, we're....honestly, I don't see much analogy out there, but what we're doing is finding and using tools.  We don't invent those tools, we find them.  Empire Nunu existed *LONG* before we called it that.  In-Sec didn't invent the play we name after him, I'm not even sure he discovered it, but he did popularize it.  Even things like tele/smite top has been a thing people of *ALL ELOS* have been looking at since forever, every time a promising change comes down the pipeline.  There's a reason smite-top WW/Fiora were ibiquitous immediately upon the launch of pre-season.  That never took off because Riot threw nerf after nerf at it until it stopped because top-smite-WW was stupid, but the idea was there.  When cinderhulk offered a stronger scaling option for top-smite, the conversation came back up(idk the rank fo the guy on reddit I saw theorycrafting it before everybody else, but he wasn't good enough to pull rank, so I'm assuming not challenger).  Sure, teleport is new, but its a logical transition on the champions using it.  Hecarim didn't really need flash, but top laners kinda do need teleport at the pro level and probably as far down as gold, so nobody is really surprised that this transition happened.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"manbearswine","date":"2015-04-20T01:59:08.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sammystorm,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tX2huQbF,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2015-04-20T01:25:20.359+0000)\n>\n> They do decide it.

Sorry. Ranked is about playing the game competitively, not about playing your favorite champion. If you get the chance to, great! But don't expect it. Play to win. Play for the challenge. Just because you enjoy full AD Nasus in the jungle, doesn't make it a good idea when people are playing to win(yes there is a difference, and no that doesn't mean they're not playing for fun). Please don't take this as me saying don't have fun. Just don't go into ranked and do stupid stuff. Especially if you're lower ranked. You don't fully understand the game yet. You're not going to get away with full tank Teemo like a Diamond can.\n\nOutside of this, yes. Play what you want. As long as you can preform that roll, you are doing nothing wrong. Knowing how to win the game will get you higher in rank than knowing how to do well on a champion. I'd even say mastering your champion is the least important thing you can do. Master your enemy, the map, then your own champion. Mastering your champion will only win you lane. How often do we see threads about \"won lane, lost game, stupid team\". \n\nIn short, play what you enjoy while being respectful to those who have to play with you. Before you try to make ADC Brand a thing, you better understand the map and the enemy a bit better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pæan","date":"2015-04-19T22:29:08.303+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Dude why are you playing shaco, he is a cRap champ.

Remember when Riven used to be built much more tanky? I once saw a game where HotShotGG rushed Warmog's on her.
