I'm talking about Nasus Wither, Shen Taunt, Olaf ult, + Yi ult at the same time, Skarner ult (or any suppress in general) all in one kit. I just want a champion that punishes all this fucking mobility Riot is shoving in every champ. I swear since Vel'Koz Riot has decided every champion must have more mobility than the next. No seriously, think about it.\r\n\r\n{{champion:161}}: No mobility.\r\n{{champion:201}}: Can dash only to allies, not including wards.\r\n{{champion:150}}: Spammable slow with jump that increases if it hits a target (not including wards).\r\n{{champion:268}}: Free harass invulnerable units you can dash to, who can also dash themselves to increase your dash to them.\r\n{{champion:429}}: Vayne Q on every auto. Free ward. Ability to FORCE a teammate to you (they have no say in taking Black Spear and no say in when they get pulled to you. Legit, I have been binded by so many Kalistas as jungle that jsut pull you so they can take a fucking kill from you. Seriosuly, fuck this champion in every aspect).\r\n{{champion:421}}: System of 10 minute lasting reusable tunnels which you can tp to. This is the only champion who breaks the rule of \"Give more mobility than the last.\"\r\n\r\nJudging by this the next champion will most likely have a 2 second cooldown manaless Kassadin ult (but it won't do damage so it will totally be balanced) and a point and click ranged execute, along with their ultimate allowing them to instantly be anywhere on the map and invulnerable for 10 seconds while there.","replies":[{"poster":"Raptamei","date":"2015-02-15T12:39:16.173+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JustBlameJungler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=nGJQtG8z,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-02-15T06:35:07.690+0000)\n>\n> I just want a champion that punishes all this fucking mobility Riot is shoving in every champ.\n\nBack when top was dominated by certain bruisers and Riot intentionally released \"a champion that punishes all this fucking [stat ball melee]\" (Darius), people did not adapt and pick ranged or mage champions top, they just whined until he got nerfed.","replies":[{"poster":"KaisadiIIa","date":"2015-02-16T01:40:14.195+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now tell me a champion who counters mobility.","replies":[]},{"poster":"manbearswine","date":"2015-02-16T00:37:44.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Raptamei,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=nGJQtG8z,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-02-15T12:39:16.173+0000)\n>\n> Back when top was dominated by certain bruisers and Riot intentionally released \"a champion that punishes all this fucking [stat ball melee]\" (Darius), people did not adapt and pick ranged or mage champions top, they just whined until he got nerfed.\n\nThat's not it at all,say I release this champion who would counter mobility really hard,so I'll pick it,then my team will go zed,kalista,lee,thresh,gnar(just replace one of these slots with wherever you want to put him) whereas the enemy team will be stuck with things that get facerolled by mobility.\n\nmaking a champion who counters mobility will just make said champion 100% ban,I'm all for a champion with mobility countering abilities(rapture anyone?) but only if we balance mobility first,otherwise we just get azir.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SuperS0aker","date":"2015-02-15T13:30:20.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too true.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Veraska","date":"2015-02-15T06:51:42.413+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think a cool mechanic would for a champion would be like they shoot a tether out and if it hits a champion they can fire another tether at a wall and it'd basically shackle them to the wall and they could only move as far as the tethers length, it would also disable any mobility abilities (something smite has is cripple, which just makes it so you can't use jumps or dash's or your blink)\n\ni think it'd be a cool tool like, and admittedly i thought it'd be a little wonky feeling in league but honestly i thought the same about abilities that would block projectiles, ever since {{champion:157}} and {{champion:201}} came out with their projectile blocking spells it's really made me look at new mechanics differently.\n\ni dunno i thought shackling your opponents to the wall would be a cool way mechanic, i pictured it on a vayne style ADC but i can see how the boards would HATE that","replies":[]},{"poster":"cocacolalips","date":"2015-02-15T17:48:30.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You mean, like a slow?
