Shen not viable in jungle. Elise buffs not enough (can't compete with others still), Eve buffs not enough (same as Elise), Hecarim buffs are eh (still no mana although new chilling smite is better for him that before since he gets AD from it).\r\n\r\nI just don't see a reason to pick things like Rammus when Leona can clear better than him (Yes, I have played both, Tri-Force tank Leona clears infinitely better and ganks better). Evelynn can't do much still. Elise same. Hecarim has way too little mana to do anything. I don't see who would pick those champions (along with Skarner, Nautilus, Zac, and many more who pretty much can only jungle since they were designed for that only) over things like Warwick, Lee Sin, Jarvan, Master Yi, Xin Zhao, Vi etc...\r\n\r\nSeriously, what the actual hell is Rammus supposed to do now? At least Urgot can go top and do decent. Fiddlesticks can solo dragon level 3 and still have full hp(probably even 2 with right runes and masteries), but Evelynn, a champion who in lane would literally not have a passive, has worse clear speeds AND worse sustain.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-01-15T22:58:15.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure Lee Sin will still wreck everyone.","replies":[{"poster":"Visigoth","date":"2015-01-15T22:59:19.352+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=InsaneSamurai,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=POdbtAOI,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-15T22:58:15.491+0000)\n>\n> Pretty sure Lee Sin will still wreck everyone.\n\nnever wont unless he gets serious number nerfs like elise or a full kit rework (which wont ever happen)","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-01-15T23:09:01.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A man can hope :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Leti the Yeti","date":"2015-01-15T23:10:50.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so.... people are \nRammus awful?\nwotm8?\n\nI take trailblazers on rammus just cuz his ganks were potent enough and I was just behind on farm and wave clear ;l\nthe 2 trailblazer charges are a buff to many champions who struggled in the jungle\nlike idk Eve Naut Rammus Skarner Hecarim Zac...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2015-01-15T22:59:49.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hm, haven't had a problem with Hecarim or Naut, not to mention both are getting buffed this patch.\n\nWhat clear path do you take?","replies":[]},{"poster":"AtheosisX","date":"2015-01-15T22:59:03.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Complains about farming junglers taking over the jungle and then lists a bunch of junglers who are gankers first and foremost.
