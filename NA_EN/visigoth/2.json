Ideally, the mechanic should be phased out completely, since it counters healing in a manner that is both excessively harsh and low on gameplay. I think the gameplay behind healing should be \"this champion is healing for a lot right now, I should outplay that in this fight\", and not \"this champion has a lot of healing, I should cut that in half for the rest of the game\". Because Mundo or Swain-like healing doesn't really allow for strategy 1 (there's no real way of outplaying their healing on a play-by-play basis), the default so far has been strategy 2, and I think that's something that needs to be fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"test account","date":"2015-04-09T16:59:59.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair, you can wait out Mundo's ult.

The problem with that is that heals would actually have to be nerfed pretty much across the board to compensate, which would throw off balance really hard. A similar situation would arise, actually, if they made Grievous Wounds *more* accessible. Thus, They're going to be treading very carefully around what they change in regards to it.

(And with how common ignite is, well, it's no wonder how frequently they see competitive play.)\n\nI would actually favor indirect nerfs over direct ones, e.g. longer CD for Mundo and heavier mana costs for Swain, so that their ults are still good at what they do, but the opposing team has more opportunity to engage when they're not available.
