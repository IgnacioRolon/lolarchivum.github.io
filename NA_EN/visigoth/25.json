So now Sated Devourer gets to rape with anyone who has on-hit affects and likes attack speed ({{champion:11}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:10}} ). With the new Rylai&#039;s Kayle can AoE 40% slow on a RANGED ability. The same ability is pretty much doing double damage with new Devourer. The best part? It&#039;s her auto attacks.\r\n\r\nYou also literally can&#039;t itemize against Yi now. Sated lets him proc his E 8,000 times with true damage, but if you build health BotRK destroys you. Alpha is up every .5 seconds since the on-hit counts for the reset on it.\r\n\r\nElise still got no buffs despite having her sustain nerfed last patch.\r\n\r\nBut hey, at least Tahm Kench came out, so that&#039;s cool.","replies":[{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-07-10T10:58:56.279+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:11}} is a total nightmare right now, I just hate how cheap he is... basically just Q and AA, rinse and repeat, destroying everyone while still sustaining amazingly with lifesteal and if you fuck him over, he becomes unchaseable with his ult.
