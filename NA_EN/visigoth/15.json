It's really fun being able to build real items and tank everything. I can even 1v1 some of the squishier champions! But we all know how good Leona's ganks are on Summoner's Rift. In fact, you can jungle her right now, if you want to.\n\n But imagine the jungle was changed in such a way to protect slower clearing junglers from early invades. Then the pros would pick her every game and out do Lee Sin in every way. It would be early S2 Alistar levels of bullshit. This of course would result in swift and crippling nerfs. \n\nSo, to all you tank jungler players out there: you should be rejoicing that your mains are considered \"unviable\".

Chances are we are in this mess currently because of things pro players said to Riot.  But that's a discussion for another day.\n\nWhat I do know, and what we all know, is that the jungle is hell right now.  If you are playing anything close to a competitive-type game. you have basically three realistic junglers you can pick or fall instantly behind in every way.  But, as far as I can tell, in normal/less stressed play you can basically play anything as a jungler right now - it just won't be God tier.

If a jungler does not have all 3 of these, they are basically outclassed in every way:\n\n1. A gap closer that is on a relatively short CD\n2. Some form of CC that prevents the opponent from immediately reacting or enables the attacker to stick to the target\n3. High base damage/% health/armor shred (basically a finishing move)\n\nIt is for this reason that Vi, Jarvan, Lee, Wukong (not as common but has all of these traits), Pantheon, Reksai (to a lesser extent) are so prevalent.  They don't need to build tanky until mid game because their base damage is so high and they pretty much get the kill.  \n\nI want to put a special mention in here for Kha'zix because until recently I considered him a top tier jungler. With all of the constant jungle nerfs, the Kha'zix nerfs, and item nerfs, this champion cannot hope to compete with those junglers listed above. His isolation was supposed to be a mechanic for search and destroy. You find the enemy jungler at his buff and you kill him with relative ease. I have tried this now and I hate to say it but without significant item purchases in combination with his evolved Q (and in isolation), Kha'zix is only effective if the enemy makes too many mistakes. As a jungler trying to punish laning opponents early, he cannot be the one to get the ball rolling so to speak as far as ganks are concerned. I feel like this is a pretty huge flaw for an assassin that thrives on very small opportunities. Isolation became this incredibly hard mechanic to use on such a squishy little bug. With today's high mobility, good luck ever catching your target or effecting a play that lets you get in more than 1 isolated Q. What it boils down to is that the trade off of having a high burst damage with isolation is not great enough for how difficult it is to isolate a target. This wouldn't really be such a big problem if he was given very significant bonuses to isolation beginning at level 1.\n\nI wont even get started on jungle tanks. That is a whole different can of worms.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hermes","date":"2015-02-26T09:55:45.866+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm starting to think that Riot's balance team has been hijacked, Tea Party-style, by a small but vocal minority of top laners who don't know what a ward is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2015-02-26T00:00:22.693+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":10,"body":"Viable champon at the moment on Jungle (assuming you have moderate knowledge of jungle)\n\n{{champion:64}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:254}} they are the top tier\n\n{{champion:113}} Unless you get counterjungle during your first clear you are good to go.

The changes are steps in the right direction, they might not be big enough steps, but Riot will continue to work on the jungle throughout the season.  \"Everybody switches to Chilling for free when they want to start ganking\" had to go before jungle items could be balanced against each other, and chilling really really REALLY deserved a nerf.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FirstSergeantBim","date":"2015-02-27T17:31:05.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know, I see so many threads qq'ing about the new jungle that I thought I would give my two cents. I have been jungling since Season 3 and I honestly couldn't be happier with the new changes. Based on my experience prior to Season 5, I really feel like the jungle is a more dynamic environment, it's easier to use and it has a bigger impact on each match, not only that, but I think there are MORE choices and there is MORE diversity than ever before. \n\nIt is obvious there will be a select number of champions that do better than others in SoloQ, but how is that different than any other role in the game. These champions (and there are a lot of them) are better than others because their kit brings universal strength to a team composition, additionally, there are champions who can bring a unique dynamic to the jungle that may not contribute as heavily to the current meta. That is working as intended and makes complete sense. \n\nAnother issue I have is that I really wonder if people actually know how to use the jungle now. It is a fair bit more complicated with the stronger jungle monsters, but the Smite Buffs give you so much more power to clear and sustain in the jungle. Each time I see one of these threads, I question whether or not these players are properly utilizing the jungle structure Riot has laid out because I have absolutely no problem clearing with nearly any champion w/o a leash, it's all about your masteries, runes and smite decisions. \n\nThere are so many troll threads about how Jarvan, Vi and Lee Sin are the only viable junglers, but that is simply not true. How is Nunu never mentioned? He's the quintessential jungler and is probably THE safest jungle pick in the game right now because he will remain relevant throughout the entire game and can clear like no one else. The fact so many dismiss him should be evidence of their ignorance. \n\nI think the jungle's fine. It's just a trip for those of you who can't think outside of the box.

So no, not \"literally every jungler\" thinks the changes are retarded.\n\nCongrats, you're one of the few people who think the changes aren't horrible.\n\nI main Vi, and quite frankly I can't play her at all in ranked. She is banned or picked so damn much, I have to rub a rabbits foot and hope that I get to use her.\n\nThe changes really hurt those junglers that aren't Top tier, and what Riot is saying is the exact opposite of what they are doing and people are getting upset at this.\n\nThey make changes that have little effect the the top tier, but really hurt the less meta picks, thus making it a less diverse jungle and giving less options in how you play the game.\n\nSwitching smites was a great way to offer choices in how to play and allowed you to change up your style OR have some sustain and be viable.\n\nAs a Vi main I could take Trail Blazer and take a level 3 dragon real quick, or farm even faster to get to 6. Sometimes I'd take Poachers Smite and do a bit of counter jungling in the early game, but then switch out for a Chilling Smite to help chase down people, or realize I need the vision with Dueling Smite. Now with a gold cost to switch Smites you give a poverty level jungler an extra tax. Is this Republican Land or something?\n\nThere are a ton of ways to fix this, and yet they chose to go in the exact opposite direction. You know what might help, a buff to the tank jungle item, I don't play many jungle tanks, but if I did I wouldn't (95% of the time) buy the waste of an item. +500 hp and some tenacity? Let's say im Mao, I rather just get some AP and get my tenacity and hp with my other 5 items.\n\nOut of all the jungling items the Tank one is absolutely useless.\n\nWhat they could do to fix this is to lower the cost of machete so they could get some more health pots. As Vi I certainly don't need more than 2 to stay fairly healthy, but others due, and by denying them that they tell players \"We don't want you playing this character in the jungle, go back to top/mid/bot where you belong\".\n\nSeason 4 I saw lots of junglers of all shapes and sizes, some more viable than others.\n\nIn Season 5 I have seen less and less variety, to the point I can't play Vi without her getting banned and if not banned then picked.","replies":[{"poster":"ks916","date":"2015-02-26T04:03:02.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As I a fellow vi main I feel your suffering (been playing her since her release),  she's either picked very early on or banned in ranked I feel this new patch will make it even worse.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
