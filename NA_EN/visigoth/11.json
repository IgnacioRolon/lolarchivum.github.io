Others say he was banished into the Void and removed from the Legendary League of Remarkable People, but this mighty hero is fabled to one day return. And on that day, the mighty hero {{champion:24}} with lead the army of Nerflandia, and guide us on the Great March to overpower the holy guardian {{champion:64}} and press forward. And according to legend, the armies of Nerflandia will then fight onward, through the dreaded jungle of {{champion:76}}, past {{champion:238}}'s Shadow Temple, march through the Shadow Isles, stalked by {{champion:429}}, then trek the mighty Freljord, and slay the Ice Witch {{champion:127}}. According to legends, then, and only then, will the citizens of Nerflandia once again be free to roam Runeterra.","replies":[{"poster":"ScurvyNave","date":"2015-02-25T06:16:18.370+0000","up_votes":190,"down_votes":2,"body":"Still better than the new Lore teams work AM I RIGHT?","replies":[{"poster":"DomainSpecific","date":"2015-02-25T06:27:49.751+0000","up_votes":79,"down_votes":1,"body":"Still? \n\nThis is way better than anything the Lore team could even dream to create (I am still salty about Trundle's lore rework).","replies":[{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2015-02-26T02:12:49.737+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want to continue.\n\nAs our warriors marched onward, looking for a means of escape, Kassadin finally couldn't stand it no longer.\n\n{{champion:38}} MY LEGS!!\n\nThe group had no choice but to split up.

If she dies, well its now a 4v5. Also burning flash to save herself means no flash-ult initiations from her for a notable length of time.\n\nThis means certain junglers absolutely ruin Sona's viability, because she absolutely cannot save the ADC from them if they get caught before 6th.
