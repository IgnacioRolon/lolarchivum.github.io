But some of the champs used here are also absolutely overtuned and could use some changes (and some are undertuned and could use some changes, but that's besides the point).  The pros aren't the only places where they're incredibly successful.  And I feel that Riot seems to ignore those champs in favor of nerfing the meta-supporting or meta-countering characters we've been seeing a lot of lately (Azir, Xerath, etc).\n\nKassadin is currently desired among the pros for his roaming potential, his slippery nature, and his incredibly consistent burst damage.  He's not as damaging or mobile as other champions, but that consistency gives him the edge over many champions who are mobile and rely on dodging/hitting skillshots.  He's not an amazing, pick, but he is a solid one.  THAT'S why he's picked in the LCS.

Because a champion that has, for some reason, received huge amounts of nerfs = OP?\n\nWhat part about Kassadin, honestly, is toxic? Is it his ult? {{champion:103}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:84}} all have much more mana/energy efficient gap-closers that can potentially be just as powerful as Kass's mobility, except without the scaling costs. After the nerfs, almost all of those dashes and blinks and what-not will completely outrange Kassadin for a fraction of the cost **with non-ultimate abilities**. Q Silence was removed for a channel interrupt and a very short-lived magic shield. His W is tied to his melee, short-range basic attack, and is about the only thing in his kit that does damage anymore. His E requires 6 spells to activate, and all it provides is slightly more damage than his Q along with a slow. Again, all of that is very short range, meaning you have to ult into range to use any of it. If you reduce his ult range, keep the scaling mana cost, and keep his short-range abilities, he will be **absolutely useless**\n\nYou're right that he has a high ban rate (~40% ban rate in all ranked games, ranked #4 of all champions behind Nidalee, Jarvan and Irelia [in EUW, he's 3rd top ban behind Nid and Irelia at nearly 55% of ranked games. In Brazil, he's #6 at around 30%]). However, he is not \"pick or ban\", he's not even in the top 15 most popular for any region. In all ranked games, he has a 9.38% pickrate and 47% winrate (if you have both a low pick and win rate, then *generally* there might be something wrong. Notice I said *generally*, as win/pick rate isn't a good measure of champion strength unless it's some insane outlier). He barely sees more play than Malphite, but at a much lower winrate.\n\nSources: [http://www.lolking.net/champions/](http://www.lolking.net/champions/) and [http://www.lolking.net/charts](http://www.lolking.net/charts)\n\nThere, I used data as well. Shall we use more?\n\nKassadin passive: -15% magic damage taken and ignores unit collision\nZed passive: Zed's basic attacks do 6/8/10% max health to target as magic damage when target is below 50% health. Effect only occurs once every 10 seconds\n\nKass Q: lock on, deals 70/95/120/145/170 (70% AP) and gives magic shield that lasts 1.5 seconds at 40/70/100/130/160 (30% AP). Mana cost is 70/75/80/85/90 on a 9 second cooldown at 650 range\nZed Q: skillshot, deals 75/115/155/195/235 (100% AD). Second target receives 60% damage. Shadow Shuriken deals 50% damage and restores energy if both shurikens hit the same target. Costs 75/70/65/60/55 energy on a 6 second cooldown at 900 range [little note, a rank 5 shuriken with no CDR is fully refunded after cooldown expires because of Zed's energy regeneration]\n\nKass W: basic attack enhancer, passively causes his basic attacks to do 20 + 10% AP damage on hit. Active causes next basic attack to deal 40/65/90/115/140 (60% AP) and restore 4/5/6/7/8% missing mana on hit (x5 mana restored on champion hit). On a 9 second cooldown with no cost\nZed W: linear skillshot, passively increases Zed's bonus AD by 5/10/15/20/25%. Active creates a shadow for 4 seconds that mimics Zed's abilities and can be swapped with. Any hit from the shadow's abilities restores 20/25/30/35/40 energy. It is on a 18/17/16/15/14 second cooldown with energy at 40/35/30/25/20\n\nKass E: conic AoE, passively gains charges whenever a spell is cast by or around him. At 6 charges, he can activate it to do a 50/60/70/80/90% slow for 1 second and do 80/105/130/155/180 (70% AP) damage. 700 range, 80 mana on 6 second cooldown [another note, it's gated by the fact that 6 spells have to be cast around him, so cooldown isn't always relevant)\nZed E: instant AoE, does 60/90/120/150/180 (80% AD) and slows for 20/25/30/35/40% to all targets within 290 range. Each champion hit reduces cooldown of his W by 2 seconds. Shadow Slice also slows, and provides 50% of the current slow of his E on top of Zed's original slow (20% becomes a 30% slow, ect.) but it deals no additional damage. This also restores energy. Cost is 50 energy on a 4 second cooldown\n\nKass ult: ground targeted blink, can teleport Kass 700 units (soon to be 450 units) away, and deals 80/100/120 (2% max mana) damage to targets 150 units from target location. Each subsequent teleport within 20 seconds adds a stack, which doubles the mana cost and increases damage by 50%, up to 4 times. Initial cost at all levels is 75. After riftwalking *n* times within 20 seconds, the total cost over time is 75/225/525/1125/2325, dealing a maximum of 240/300/360 (6% max mana) on the final stack [previous damage I listed is based on level, not how many stacks you acquire]. Has a 7/5/3 second cooldown\nZed ult: single-targetted dash, Zed becomes untargetable for 0.75 seconds and dashes behind target. Marks the target and creates another shadow in the cast location that lasts for 6 seconds that functions the same as his W. This shadow can also be swapped with. After 3 seconds, death mark triggers, dealing 100% of Zed's AD (+25/25/50% of all physical and magic damage dealt to the target in those 3 seconds). Has a 120/100/80 second cooldown.\n\nSo, which one do you think does more damage? Which one has the higher pick and win rate? Which one does both physical and magic damage, has insanely low costs with insanely high regeneration, and does extremely massive damage in 3 seconds of time?\n\n>\"I'm a shit player and i can't beat assassins in lane\"\n\nDoes Kass have the waveclear Zed does? Does he have both the engage and disengage? Does he have the flat-out irrelevant energy costs on all of his abilities?

Thank you Solaxo, level 30 EUNE Who doesn't have a badge at all for really explainig exactly why the Korean pro scene is bad at league of legends.\n\nGnar has a spammable skill, and one that can be dodged rather easily too. Kassadin loves champion with spammable skills, not hard to figure out why he did well.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KaisadiIIa","date":"2015-02-19T18:21:05.932+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You know Kassadin has been in the game since 2,009, and he was never \"must pick or ban\" (just a few months in early 2,014), true?","replies":[{"poster":"AHeroNamedHawke","date":"2015-02-19T21:31:40.545+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ShinobuElveszett,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vE5NNQtQ,comment-id=00050003,timestamp=2015-02-19T18:21:05.932+0000)\n>\n> You know Kassadin has been in the game since 2,009, and he was never \"must pick or ban\" (just a few months in early 2,014), true?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztVMib1T4T4","replies":[]},{"poster":"BetaDude40","date":"2015-02-20T04:14:54.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe all through Season 3 when he still had his silence, he had the most ridiculous ban rate of any champion in the game, like somewhere around 80-90% of all ranked games (needs confirmation).
