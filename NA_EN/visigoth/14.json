PRACTICE COUNTERGANKS!\n\nSnipped the rest for brevity, since this is basically the important part.\n\nI prefer jungle myself, and let me tell you, *it is extremely hard to set up a counter-gank.*\n\nYou need to have wards that warn you well in advance of the enemy jungler (or laner) ganking, and there are multiple paths they can take for it. On top of that, you need to be in the same quarter of the map if you want to be able to respond quickly enough. If you're more than 10 seconds away, you might not even make it there before the whole thing is over.\n\nCounter-ganking is less of a strategy and more of a reaction. It *is* a strategic reaction, but you can't really plan for it. Back in the older seasons when there was no ward limit, you could get enough vision to plan it out, but that's ancient history.","replies":[{"poster":"ZeeDrakon","date":"2015-05-03T21:29:26.567+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":20,"body":"It is NOT a reaction.as main jungler you should be able to predict where the enemy jungler goes, esp with wards and knowing how the lanes are going and where they srand.

Dunno your elo though, maybe that's too much to ask\n\n1) I'm a jungler, not a psychic. I'm going to place wards--and *hopefully* the laners will as well--in locations where I can see the enemy players coming in, so we can intercept them or avoid them. That doesn't mean I'm going to know where the enemy jungler is at all times. I might see them once in a while when they try to do a thing where I've warded, but that's as much as everyone else will know.\n\n2) Yes, it *is* a reaction. The only way counter-ganking can not be a fully reactive play is if you are **camping the lane.** Which means losing gold and exp to babysit a lane that's pushed, but doesn't want you walking close enough to get exp or farm gold (and I'm not an asshole; laners need their gold and exp just as much, so I'm not going to drain them if they're there). While I have no problem with taking 30 seconds to stand on the sidelines as a human ward, if I wait too long for something to happen, all I'll have done is given the enemy jungler an easy lead--or worse, an opening to take objectives or gank another lane while I was protecting one lane--because I'm not farming anything.\n\nI don't know your ELO, but I know you know *nothing* about jungling.","replies":[{"poster":"T RexHasLongLegs","date":"2015-05-03T22:14:04.875+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"So I think the guy you're responding to is wrong too, but as someone who mained jg s3, and plays a champ that is almost always pushed top lane now I can comment a little as to areas where you're a bit off too.\n\nSo the thing about maining jungle is you know jungle pathing and thinking better than most other players.

When you get to higher levels people start doing things like shifting clear patterns to secure buffs.\n\nAn example of how you can use this is to ward their first botside buff to try to get the timer for it. You could then utilise that timer to do a few things. You can gank top on the timer assuming there's no dragon pressure as you know they'll most likely be in their bot side jungle. You can use the timing when they move up towards their top side buff to attempt to rush a Drag. Or you could hang around bot side to make sure you're ready to countergank if their jungle does gank.\n\nBut the thing with all these strategies is that the only work if the enemy is actually doing what you expect. At higher ranks there's a very good chance they will be but down in lower ranks there's a much higher chance that the enemy jungle is doing their doubles completely oblivious to the fact that their blue just spawned.\n\n>Yes, the only constant in your own game history is yourself.
