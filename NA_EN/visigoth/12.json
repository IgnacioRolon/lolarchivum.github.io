Any other assassin in the game can make a kill in the middle of a teamfight, risky as hell that may be. Kha'Zix cannot, and it is not merely up to possibility as it is with other assassins, they can accomplish that, but is nearly impossible for the Voidreaver to do likewise _because of an explicit mechanic in his kit_. What distinguishes Kha'Zix further from most assassins is that a target can be completely separate from a teammate with no hope of assistance, yet a single minion can effectively deny Kha'Zix the ability to unleash his maximum potential damage.\n\nNo other assassin is weighted by the same stipulations. Katarina, LeBlanc, Zed, Talon, Rengar, ie., can deal their damage without having to worry about a silly minion wandering too close and completely nullifying their damage.\n\nTo tie in this lengthy explanation with my attempt at humor, which you did not hind amusing sadly, it is best recommended that any Kha'Zix avoid confrontation unless they are absolutely, positively certain their enemy is completely alone, which means no teammates or minions.","replies":[{"poster":"Transgressor","date":"2015-05-23T06:04:24.468+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Why did you get agittated?

No other assasin can do that, moreso the ones you mentioned. Keep in mind a REALLY IMPORTANT FACT: Kha's the only assasin in the game that has such a massive gap closer, which does damage and RESETS on kill or assist. Only tristana can keep up with him, but she's a ranged carry, not a burst assasin. He is the ONLY assasin in the game that can initiate from such a safe and long distance away from the intented target, deal MASSIVE burst at the same time, heal, take advantage of his itemization(because he's AD he gets stuff to do with items) and then just jump back away like nobody's business.","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2015-05-23T06:12:49.369+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"You have not seen the horror that is ap burst Zac.","replies":[{"poster":"Transgressor","date":"2015-05-23T06:48:26.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen it, oh the agony :D\n\nBut that's braking the meta though, kha is supposed to function like that internaly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hogsy","date":"2015-05-23T16:04:09.833+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah but at the same time he doesn't have the damage to 1shot an adc in the enemy team unless he's really ahead so what's the point of being able to jump from such a distance?
