Assassin or Teamfighting. You get to pick ONE.\r\n\r\nSome examples: {{champion:105}} Kill person GTFO w/ pole. {{champion:38}} Rift in, wreck carry, Rift out. {{champion:121}} Jump in, make sure target is alone, delete their HP, hop the fuck out. {{champion:11}} Pray to god you don&#039;t get CC&#039;d, because the second you do, you&#039;re fucked. {{champion:107}} Jump on carry, kill them, probably die because you have such strong damage Riot gave you no escape.  Even assassin&#039;s considered &#039;broken&#039; by many people don&#039;t do well in teamfights. {{champion:238}} and {{champion:7}} sure can easily kill your carry and escape, but it&#039;s pretty unlikely that a non-fed as shit Zed or LeBlanc is going to kill multiple people.\r\n\r\nNext thing we have is currently considered a huge issue with some assassins. The safety factor. Zed and LeBlanc are hated for it, Kha&#039;Zix got gutted for about a month because of it. Kassadin has received a metric fuckton of changes because of his. Ekko has an &quot;oops&quot; button that costs no mana, heals, and does damage.\r\n\r\nMobility. &quot;League of Legends isn&#039;t turning into an utter mobility fest.&quot; Yeah, let&#039;s give this guy a dash that can go through most walls, and then his next auto attack will blink to the target. Because fuck it.\r\n\r\nNow what&#039;s the biggest thing that most assassins don&#039;t have, or have very little of? That&#039;s right, CC! Except Ekko! He gets a 2+ second AoE stun with a huge ass shield. He also gets a slow, which you will be forced to dodge all laning phase because it&#039;s pretty much a Nidalee spear that goes through targets but does *slightly* less damage.\r\n\r\nNow quick, name a champion that should almost never lose lane, especially against a melee champion? That&#039;s, good ol&#039; {{champion:58}}. Playing as Renekton, vs a **first time** Ekko, I barely won lane. Of course, he did get some ganks, but that&#039;s not the point. Nobody should have an easy time against Renekton. He is the epitome of fucking your lane phase up. Not Ekko&#039;s though, he just sits back, gets CS with Q, and as soon as you go in he throws down his slow/stun, dashes away, and then can always press his &quot;oops&quot; button if you try to tower dive him. The only times I was able to kill him (I didn&#039;t have ignite) was if I flash stunned or waited in a bush until he thought I backed.\r\n\r\nFuck this champion. Fuck this mobility creep. Next champion better have some sort of stupid ass anti mobility mechanic. Mobility creep is getting retarded. You&#039;d think Riot would&#039;ve stopped after dashing on every auto attack.","replies":[{"poster":"qetzel","date":"2015-05-30T10:03:43.834+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":2,"body":"Just... you know... the Q.

Ekko doesn't have an \"almost everyone can do this\" counter play.  Dodge his AoE shield/stun, and you still have his hard upfront burst to deal with, dodge his disc thing, same thing.  And his ult is incredibly overpowered.  Creating an \"Oops\" button is stupid.  At least Zilean's ult has a downside, in that even though it might heal a ton of damage, it doesn't matter much of the entire enemy team is standing on your body.  Ekko's ult allows him to jump back a huge distance, and if anyone is trying to predict that and stand near that point, he'll hit you for 500 damage PLUS 130% of his AP.  Where's the counterplay in that?\n\nCounterplay only works if you can counterplay and still focus on farming.  His shit is so wonky and difficult to avoid that you spend almost all of laning phase just trying not to get hit by his disc and by this shield/stun.  Make the shield/stun balanced.  Shield only applies if an enemy champion is standing in the circle, and the stun is slightly lowered, plus make it so you can see the circle 1 second in advance, instead of .5.\n\nNext, his phase dive should just allow him to jump forward and immediately attack, not flash and then jump forward.\n\nHis ult shouldn't heal NEARLY as much, and the AoE on it should be much smaller.  The damage is understandable if the AoE wasn't so large.  The whole point is, he's slippery to catch, and you shouldn't be punished for attempting to predict him.  If 3 people chase him and 2 of us stand back near his ult point, I shouldn't be bursted down for trying to predict it just because I was keeping myself within range of my abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"For Carthage","date":"2015-05-31T07:04:37.250+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fanryu,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6xVfuP7w,comment-id=000400020000,timestamp=2015-05-31T01:47:50.686+0000)\n>Creating an \"Oops\" button is stupid.\n\n{{champion:238}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:120}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:76}} \n\nDid someone say \"Oops\"?","replies":[{"poster":"Dragonface","date":"2015-05-31T11:25:00.909+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me take a second to explain why all of these champions don't have an oops button.\n\nZed - His ult puts him dead center of your team, if you're fast enough, you can stun him and all of his damage is completely gone, as he can't add damage to his ult's burst damage.\n\nFizz - has to choose between gap closing to you, or saving it to escape.\n\nJ4?

His trail is traceable, he's pretty easy to locate, he's fucked without his ult, and his entire kit relies on being able to either move or use his abilities.  Stop letting him engage on you and charge his ass when he whiffs his W - his burst is only exceptional if he's ahead.  Most assassins already in the game pack far more upfront power than he could dream of unless he actually manages to nail his ult on a squishy target, which there's not only a clone of him indicating where it'll land - it's marked by a big fuckin' red arrow saying, \"HEY, HEY. THIS SPOT HERE? DON'T FUCKING STAND HERE.\"  His W is otherwise the only major reason teamfights can be tipped decisively in his favor, and that takes 3 goddamn seconds to warm-up and drop in the designated area, _and_ you get a .5 second warning on it as well, which is more of a warning than most champs give you other than, \"Hey my high CC high damage ult's up k you're dead now bai nao~.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Dragonface","date":"2015-05-31T22:37:48.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Say it now, but everyone here knows he'll be nerfed next patch.

Just like Talon, it's also very easy to force Ekko to use Timewinder to waveclear pre-6 without taking any harass from it.\n\nI won't argue that Talon's passive is stronger than Ekko's—it isn't, because Ekko's passive has great base damage and insane scaling for a 3-hit mechanic that procs on both autoattacks and every hit from his abilities. (Maybe if Timewinder could only proc one stack, like Gnar's boomerang, it would be more reasonable, even if the damage didn't change.
