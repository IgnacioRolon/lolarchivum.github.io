Zed normally hovers at a win rate around 47-48%, Lee Sin is normally around 45-46% win rate. Are those champions strong? Yes, and have a ton of potential in their kit. However, to consistently succeed on the likes of Zed and Lee Sin requires significant mechanical skill. Thats one of the reasons why they don't receive a lot of nerfs; yeah they are potentially game changers and carry super hard if in the right hands, but thats the key. In the right hands. Its fair balance for a champion to have a strong kit but to actually utilize it properly require a significant skill level. Most of the people who complain about Lee Sin or Zed or the like on the fourms are either: A) bad/got recently stomped by one, or B) dislike them for their popularity. The balance of a champion should not depend on their popularity. I mean, its just logical reasoning that if X champion is OP/Broken then X champion should consistently be winning more than average. Also, if a champion is really popular, then you should know how to play with and against them. Akali would be a fair complaint champion in regarding needing nerfs cause she is strong but has a low skill floor and a consistently above average win rate (but, as loathe I am to say it due to my burning hatred for Akali, shouldn't probably get massively nerfed cause her's isn't super higher than average). And back to the Original Post, that is just a dumb excuse anyone like that would give no matter what champion they are playing; from 'Lucky I ran out of energy' if on Zed, 'Lucky I ran out of mana' if on Oriana, etc. They are just excuses.","replies":[{"poster":"asktiks","date":"2015-01-24T17:05:43.349+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"do you even know how percentages work? \n\nOF COURSE its going to be more skewed toward the loss side because there is a bigger pool to make up the statistic as compared to swain\n\n4 percent PICK RATE means that with just 2 percent of players playing swain winning you are already at a 50 percent win rate \n\n20 percent pick rate means that you would need TEN percent of players playing sin to win games so you would get a 50 percent win rate..\n\nTLDR: bigger number of people making up the statistic makes it more accurate, swains over fifty percent win rate is skwed on account of his low pick rate..\n\ncomprende?","replies":[{"poster":"zliplus","date":"2015-01-25T12:26:26.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> 4 percent PICK RATE means that with just 2 percent of players playing swain winning you are already at a 50 percent win rate\n> \n> 20 percent pick rate means that you would need TEN percent of players playing sin to win games so you would get a 50 percent win rate..\n\nI think your understanding is correct, but the way you've said it is SO wrong math-wise that it hurts.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TheGrayBuffoon","date":"2015-01-24T20:06:20.352+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Direwolfiez,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=GJhsM0BR,comment-id=0008000100000000,timestamp=2015-01-24T08:44:11.456+0000)\n>\n> Look at their pick rates.
