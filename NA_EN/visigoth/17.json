Other champions being Yi, Trynd, Yasuo, Nocturne and Fiora - of whom, two are classified as assassins primarily and fighters secondary (Master Yi and Nocturne) and 3 are Fighter primary and Assassin secondary (Tryndamere, Yasuo, Fiora). Despite the fact that they're largely treated as melee carries by the player-base and Riot themselves.\n\nNocturne is probably the most confusing of them because his kit wants him to play like both a dueling carry and a bruiser, but he can't do either particularly well. Likewise, Kassadin wants to burst, chase and possibly duel but also can't.\n\nIf we used DotA's classing system, he'd probably have the same classification as Slark: Escape. Because damn is he good at it, and his escape abilities can also be used offensively, similar to Slark. And like Slark, both are can be exceedingly difficult to lock down.
