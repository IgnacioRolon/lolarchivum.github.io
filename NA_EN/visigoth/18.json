It is weird how TF's ult doesn't give assists and that's been an issue forever since TF's ult does in fact pop Banshee's while most reveals like Kalista's Sentinel, CV/Blue Trinket, Rengar's R, and WW's E, don't. Every other reveal does pop it since they're actually casted on the person. Some abilities just aren't known to pop spell shields. I'd guess it's because TF's ult gives immediate vision of the person that can be lost if the person manages to remove the debuff or simply not be hit by it. It's a semi-targetted ability rather than an AOE like most.\n\nBack on topic though, some abilities should give assists. Kalista's W is useful and does provide actual vision. Blue trinket and CV would be far too abusable due to low CD's, much like Rengar's R or the constant effect of WW's E. TF on the other hand should get assists since his reveal is on a 180 (Down to 120 at max rank) long CD. That's 3 minutes. Once every three minutes you'd have to waste your R to get an assist on a kill you wouldn't have participated in. I don't know about most, but I use TF's ult to gank and he goes a damn good job at it so unless you're going to be _**THAT**_ TF who never uses his ult to help and just sits and farms mid lane for the first 20 minutes, then it's not going to change much other than giving him assists where it should count, like when you pop your R for vision on the enemy team because they're doing Dragon or Baron, but you're not in range to teleport in yet. You gave the team that vision. Unlike Rengar's R or WW's E, TF's ult gives vision in a RADIUS around the target and will even show Wards and other invisible targets. Rengar's R and WW's just shows the enemy and a minuscule amount of vision around them. \n\nAll in all? I'm fine with Kalista's W giving assists IF they let TF's R finally get the respect it deserves. If you can pop a Banshee's with it, you should get an assist.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daedalus871","date":"2015-05-11T03:50:26.807+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"CertainlyT champ OP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Krys Star","date":"2015-05-11T15:48:20.026+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because CertainlyT's champions are designed to be without flaws.

I was really surprised to learn today that Thresh's Q leap can be used immediately if he hooks a minion or monster (normally it has a 0.5 second delay before you can activate it). On any other champion the ability to use that spell for escape would be coincidental/a nice touch that goes along with the general use of the spell, but Thresh's Death Leap has a clause built into it specifically designed to make it better than it would otherwise be at being an escape. Because that's necessary.\n\nAll of his champions get every bit of help they can be given.","replies":[]}]}]}
