Well that was a problem so Riot decided that she should go back mid and do the same thing, just not tanky but back with her obnoxious poke. But that's a problem so instead of nerfing her a la Kha'Zix or Elise Riot decides to LET HER JUNGLE. Because nothing says \"Season 5 jungle diversity\" like adding in yet another jungle pick that is guaranteed to molest you and your team all over the map, meaning you have to pick Jarvan, Lee or Vi. Ah yes, season 5, the time of true jungle diversity, where literally 4 champions are viable. (Okay 5 {{champion:2}}, thanks chilling smite)","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-02-11T04:45:06.681+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She hasn't been nerfed because in competitive play andhigher ELO's, Nidalee lands 1 spear once every ten minutes 'cause it's radius is utter garbage. It's easier to land literally any other skill shot and it's her only ability to close the gap. Others who need to land a skill shot to get to their target are Amumu and Lee Sin. Mu's Q is sooooooo much easier to land. You can land a max range Mu Q easier than a mid-range Nid spear. Lee has the ability to ward hop if his Q misses or simply just ward hop to ensure his Q lands. Then there's Leona, but... She also has a nice AoE stun, plus her E moves really quick.\n\nOverall, Nidalee has too little reliability in actual high-end play to be a really good mid like Ahri, Syndra, LB, etc. and her lack of CC and the fact her only gap closer has very little reliability makes her a poor jungler, which is a problem for many old junglers who CAN jungle, but gank poorly because they lack CC or a gap closer. You can look at the current top junglers and see that they have a LOT of mobility. She's pretty cool top as AD, but the lack of CC makes her subpar when compared to others like Sion, J4, Maokai, Liss, Gnar, etc.","replies":[]}]}
