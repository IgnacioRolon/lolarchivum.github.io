Anyways so I get into a game a few of my friends, and like usually, I want jungle, but this guy says he&#039;s going jungle.\r\n\r\nAlright, fine by me, pick order and all. Come his pick, this guy picks {{champion:112}}. Okay? We&#039;re a 4-man so he isn&#039;t trading. Is he gonna change last second? ***He locks it in.***\r\n\r\nWhat happened next was *fucking* ***legendary.*** This guy built Feral Flare, on Viktor, in the jungle, building AP. This guy was an absolute monster. Best part? This guy was chill as fuck.\r\n\r\nIIRC I&#039;m pretty sure me and my friend bot lane weren&#039;t doing so bad. _This guy comes in, molests the enemy **fed **bot lane, and casually walks away like he isn&#039;t a registered sex offender now._\r\n\r\nThis guy, playing AP Viktor Feral Flare jungle proceeded to prance around the map destroying the enemy. I&#039;m pretty at one point we win like a 3v5 because he was wrecking. And this wasn&#039;t a &quot;the enemy is just really bad&quot; thing, this guy was amazing.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemember guys, just because someone picks something unconventional, doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s bad. I&#039;ve seen AP Udyr do good. I&#039;ve seen AD Ahri do good. My friend and I used to do Soraka ADC w/ AP Jinx or Varus support, just because it was hilarious when the enemy thought I was the damage, when in fact, nobody expected the banana.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-05-09T22:28:15.560+0000","up_votes":149,"down_votes":3,"body":"I once had Kha'Zix jungler.
