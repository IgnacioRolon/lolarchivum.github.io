As a general rule, any champion with any form of hard CC shuts Trynd down hard ({{champion:34}} in particular makes me sad) - actually even a ranged champion with a slow will really screw him since his only way to get into range is on a longish cooldown, and his slow is on an even longer cooldown.\n\nI know, I know, \"CC shuts down any champion\"... but it's not the same as Trynd getting CC'd as say someone like Talon getting CC'd - Talon is a burst champion, so even if he only got off one spell he put out some good damage, plus he has ranged abilities if the enemy escapes. Tryndamere has no choice but to auto attack someone, which means he needs time, and tiiiime~ is not on his side; as a general rule, I would say sustained damage champions are hurt more by CC than burst champions, and Trynd is definately the former.","replies":[{"poster":"TotalJerk","date":"2015-03-11T20:45:51.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know CC is his weakness, I'm just saying that kiting really isn't a particular weakness of his over other champions.
