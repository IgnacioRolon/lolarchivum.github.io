And the stats would be 10% CDR, +10 Armor pen, (those are from Brutalizer), its current passive, 10% lifesteal, and 80 AD, which could perhaps be toned down to around 65 so it doesn&#039;t quite match the AD of {{item:1038}} items, although doing that I think the price should stay the same.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-08T20:32:13.915+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Brutalizer on Essense Reaver have a lot of sense specially by the 10% CD the AD can be down to 70.
