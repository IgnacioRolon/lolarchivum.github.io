The chances of someones main being banned would triple. I can tell you champions are very expensive. It takes up to like a year to earn even 3 6300 champs.\n\nif you play once a day maybe, its easy to get like 200 ip for a win, more if its first win of the day, boosts, whatever (baron, drags, game time)\n\nim sure theres people that play the game little enough, but for a lot people 6300 ip takes like a month at max.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MaizeCraze","date":"2015-04-23T17:55:24.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*124 champions. \n\nJust so I know where you are coming from, who do you ban with 6 picks?\n\nWho would you ban with 10?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dalthine","date":"2015-04-23T13:04:03.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I'm for ten bans just because they can then distribute them among the team members and I don't have to do it all myself with everyone screaming at me if I'm first pick. \n\nI swear it feels like I get first pick half of games I play and I hate it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-04-23T06:22:53.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"New players at level 30 would require twenty champions in order to play ranked, and considering IP prices among runes and champions alike... it would make new players wary.\n\nI think it might be partly marketing and getting new players into ranked that keeps Riot with 6 bans right now.
