It's higher base damage was just better overall for laners since it completely removed the early game issue with a cheap item that gave a huge boost, just like a Trinity Force does for an AD Ez or Corki, except cheaper and used on Assassins.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, Sheen just isn't meant to be in the jungle. It needs to be strong for junglers to be able to use it for clearing, but if it's strong enough for them, it's strong enough for a laner as well.

That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Why would Ezreal warrant that hard of a nerf? It doesn't even remotely make him overpowered. Buying it on Ezreal means sacrificing your entire early game so that you can crowed clear like a normal mid laner.

You don't end up sacrificing that much early power. It helps address mana problems, you still get an early sheen for laning, and it gives you the ability to actually push other people in instead of just losing everything to tower. It then scales better than pretty much any item he could have just because of the magic damage conversion. It's not a sacrifice if it's the best option for him, and it really is.\n\nIt's legitimately overpowered. It's quickly become pick/ban in all the competitive scenes.
