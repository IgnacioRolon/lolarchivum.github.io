It makes sense to build Sighstone and non-damage items on support because you are meant to offer utility and will never carry as hard as a mid laner. Most junglers are not built to be effective without their items, so rushing Mikael's on a Master Yi just isn't going to work out.\n\nPlay Janna and most of what you offer with your abilities is completely unaffected by what you build. A knockup is a knockup regardless of how much AP is behind it. Play an assassin jungler and don't build damage and you have for no reason decided to make yourself useless.\n\nI mean have you ever told your ADC or APC to build support? It's just not a good thing to do.

I buy wards on every back (sometimes two or three on a single back if I didn't upgrade my trinket), but nine times out of ten, the ward amount ends up being 70% Support, 25% me, and the other three players fitting into the last five percent with unupgraded trinket wards.  I only see upgraded trinkets from the rare intelligent player, or when everyone has full build.  I've even come across people at full build who deliberately avoid upgrading the trinket to piss everyone else on his team off.\n\nWhile I'm not shocked that people have connected that the jungler is everywhere, he should also carry a Sightstone (possibly stemming from how sometimes you get a tank jungler or Lee Sin carrying one in their builds), I'm a little shocked about how long it took to go from Support only and everyone flames you for doing it too, to the jungler gets demanded he too carry a Sightstone.\n\nAs for my ADC comment, the only role that is literally one champion type (and even limited within that type) is the duo lane carry, aka ADC, and of bottom lane.  Every other role, meta, and tactic can pretty much be anything.  But that team member is different.  It's the only one that has never changed for fifty-seven months (since mid summer 2011).  I've even seen Marksmen as Supports, but I have never seen any other meta where the carry wasn't a Marksman (even during the double bruiser kill meta, Marksman+Support was still a pretty dominant strategy).  Nowhere in the history of League has a real Marksman recommended to purchase a Sightstone.  By anyone.  Even if ahead, it's the only role where the community vehemently doesn't like a Sightstone in your build.  Everyone else could build six Ruby Sighstones for all they care, but if you even think about building one and people find out, you're getting nine reports (or more).  ***It's something I never understood***.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-03-19T04:20:20.133+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gonna be honest, I keep hearing the same damn excuse from Bronze players when they play adc:\n\n\"I don't have to buy wards, I'm the adc.\"\n\nA sightstone is a big safeguard from that.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DrathTurtle314","date":"2015-03-18T17:21:14.276+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm still experimenting with when to build sightstone in the jungle, but I agree that it is situational.
