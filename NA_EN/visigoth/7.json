The reason the top 4 are the top 4 is not because of how they clear at first in relation to their lesser counterparts. It is the difference of how fast they clear after buying the jungle item.\n\nThe issue with tank jungles is that your clear is at least 50% slower when you buy a juggernaut upgrade compared to someone who prefers warrior. Those 10min clears are the most important factor because you can get quite farmed while maintaining pressure and objective control. You get (for the sake of simplicity I'll go with this made up number again but you can't deny it's not at least somewhat true) 50% less gold/xp on tanks than on someone with warrior from the jungle. It doesn't matter if it's only 10% less in reality it's still a huge disadvantage. (you're also gated by your abilities = mana because you have to use more to clear and most tanks' abilities cost more than the popular ad jungles abilities). By 50% less gold and exp I mean that in order to still maintain map/game control akin to top tier junglers, you have to farm less because it takes more of your resources (time+mana). Also note I don't mean you get 50% less xp and gold on tanks but merely that you potentially get  \"50%\" less gold and xp in a very specific time frame of the game (that varies between games) where objective/game control is of utmost importance for how the game is going to unravel in the next stages of the game. Jeez I really hope I articulated this point clearly.\n\nAP jungles have the problem of no mana regen on magus = your mid laners will hate you or your gameplay will be stalled by more backs than should have been necessary.\n\nSome AD junglers are semi restricted by mana but significantly less than tanks and AP junglers due to their consistent damage output through AA.\n\nTop tier junglers have all of the goodies addressed previously on top of having unrestricted mobility, meaning they can dash into any direction they choose. Non top tier but decent AA junglers have mobility tied to targeting enemy units which means their play style is a lot more \"go HAM or go home\" - if you're slightly behind you fall further behind unless getting carried by others.\n\nTl;DR\nI just want to emphasize that you can play pretty much whatever the heck you want if you're good with it and know your power spikes/match ups etc but for a lot of champs the spikes and control you exert is rigid and predictable to an experienced player while the top junglers are very flexible. And flexibility is why jungle as a role is similar to the queen in chess. If you force your queen to not be able to move say horizontally, you're limiting yourself and opening more chances for the opponent.

This may change as player population increases and the skillcap may go from low gold to low plat, but that's the way it works. You don't have the casual player system run the game. You have people who play extensively and research and learn the ins and outs decide what is actually balanced. Not everything is balanced now, no. But would you really put the future of the game in the hands of a bronze player who mains AP Darius? Pls.\n\nJungle is by far one of the more difficult roles in competitive play. By competitive I mean anyone who is actually trying to climb the ladder and win. You have much more to learn than when to poke and when to CS, movement mechanics, etc. You have to watch the map. You have to know when to gank and when not to gank. It is much harder to be an effective jungler than an effective mid laner, and in many cases it can be much more important. As a jungler you control the flow of the game.\n\nLearning how to lane is the basic infrastructure of League of Legends. You need to learn how to lane before you learn how to jungle and affect the lanes. Sure, you can give it a go as a brand new SL 15, but don't expect to know what you're doing. It takes people thousands of games to master their roles.\n\n I agree that people like Fox and Stonewall have excellent points on the jungle. They have both been high ELO players for a very long time, so their opinions should not be ignored. However, I do think there are alternatives and people are simply overlooking them because they are not meta champs. In any season, there has always been an overlooked pool of champions ( or puddle ), and in this season it's jungle so far.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"the Anarchit3cht","date":"2015-02-26T17:27:44.173+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Considering I run ADC runes/masteries on all my junglers you DON'T need a specialized mastery/rune page.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-02-26T16:33:07.751+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Incognonymous,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=54v9WAiw,comment-id=00080000,timestamp=2015-02-26T16:09:39.467+0000)\n>\n> \"Been a Lee Sin main since season 3, and I think the jungle is fine as it is\"\n> \n> Fixed that for you, mate.

The jungle gives less gold, less experience, and more responsibility then it ever did at any point in the game, yet the tools junglers utilize have been repeatedly nerfed. I don't necessarily think any two of those factors is enough to make the jungle bad, but all of them at once is too much.

It'll make you much more credible when evaluated by someone who knows what you're trying to do. You wouldn't be so offended and defensive if I was **so horribly wrong** about my opinion of you.\n\nLastly, just because you don't REALIZE you're behind doesn't mean you aren't, and you probably WON'T realize it unless you're playing against an enemy jungler that knows how to abuse your mistakes. Good junglers will have a vice grip on your balls the second they have an advantage they can safely press.","replies":[{"poster":"FHMarshy","date":"2015-02-27T14:22:15.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And I would really think plat 1 elo actually have good junglers that does whatever you claim good junglers do, no? \n\nI pointed naut out because apparently you can win with him, meaning you don't have to pick the \"op\" champs to win if you are good with others. \n\nI am logical, you are just refusing to see it for who knows what reason.","replies":[{"poster":"Incognonymous","date":"2015-02-27T14:56:13.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FHMarshy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=54v9WAiw,comment-id=00080001000000000001,timestamp=2015-02-27T14:22:15.312+0000)\n>\n> And I would really think plat 1 elo actually have good junglers that does whatever you claim good junglers do, no? \n> \n> I pointed naut out because apparently you can win with him, meaning you don't have to pick the \"op\" champs to win if you are good with others. \n> \n> I am logical, you are just refusing to see it for who knows what reason.\n\nExcept that winning with Nautilus has exactly zero to do with how good you are and everything to do with how well your team capitalizes on what you bring to the table (CC). The problem with the current ace junglers is that many bring CC and are not team reliant.","replies":[{"poster":"FHMarshy","date":"2015-02-27T15:31:28.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But You can always easily have a Jarvan/Vi/Rek/Lee engaging without follow up and end up dying? \n\nI don't really believe any jungler can be not team reliant.","replies":[{"poster":"Incognonymous","date":"2015-02-27T16:32:47.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FHMarshy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=54v9WAiw,comment-id=0008000100000000000100000000,timestamp=2015-02-27T15:31:28.375+0000)\n>\n> But You can always easily have a Jarvan/Vi/Rek/Lee engaging without follow up and end up dying? \n> \n> I don't really believe any jungler can be not team reliant.\n\nBoy, that's a cute scenario all right. Except that those guys totally have the damage necessary to kill their target by themselves. Naut isn't supposed to. There's a difference between \"all junglers are team reliant\" and \"this champ is literally designed to give his team the tools to succeed-- he is designed team reliant\". That describes Naut perfectly. It does not describe Jarv/Vi/Rek/Lee.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
