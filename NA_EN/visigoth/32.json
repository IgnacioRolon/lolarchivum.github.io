Doesn&#039;t help that Riot is phasing out point and click CC (so basically buffing her). I imagine a few years or whenever {{champion:80}} gets updated they&#039;ll remove his stun, and thus making him unable to catch her. Seriously, it has been months and she has not received a single _meaningful_ nerf. She still gets up to 2.5 bullshit dashes a second, although realistically, she gets probably around 1.5 or 2, it&#039;s still retarded.\r\n\r\nWhy? _Seriously? Why?_ _**WHY?!?**_ Not to mention they just kinda said fuck it and gave her a slow, and an ability to force her support to come save her, giving her a knock up. She has more CC than most ADC&#039;s, one of which is hard, although reliant on an ally. She has %HP damage because &quot;you need your support to also auto attack.&quot; Oh man, enemy {{champion:20}} and {{champion:31}} both with smite are coming to take baron while your team is doing it? Don&#039;t worry, you can press E and do 3k damage. Because fuck you.\r\n\r\nIs there seriously a single person in this entire community that thinks Kalista is 100% well rounded.

Stop playing the same ADC every game you join. Play people with poke. You don't like getting grabbed by Blitzcrank? Stand behind your minions then.\n\nThe issue with blitzcrank was largely solved by his speed boost nerfs,he can't just speed boost and chase you the whole lane the second his junglers comes from a bush anymore,nor can he force an engage as easily as he used to,he actually can be punished,but mostly due to his nerfs.\n\n>Do like getting grabbed by Leona? Stay out of her range.\n\nYou do realize that means she wins right? her range is large,if both you and your adc stay our of her range you get zoned,if your adc has an escape he will still eventually get zoned due to losing trades,her e is dodgeable(somewhat) but once she get's some hp/pots it's just not worth getting near her,she regenrates damage fast,she takes little of it,but if one e lands you're still dead.\nbraum/morgana/thresh are all the same,they basically stop taking damage but if they land one ability you are still as dead as early.\n\n>I checked your match history, \n\nWish I could say the same,it's not even the about the rank,first thing I want to see is that you're not a hypocrite and actually play the squishy supports(janna is an exception,as she actually works against all this nonsense).\n\n>you are an amazing support. You need to find yourself better ADCs if they are having trouble.\n\nExcept they are not the ones having trouble,a part of being an experienced support is knowing when your pick is a liability.\n \n> God damn players like you ruined the game. Players like you are the reason why champions like Talon / Zed / Leblanc / Blitzcrank are getting nerfed so horribly.\n\nBlitzcrank is actually different from the rest of these guys,talon/zed/leblanc actually got nerfed for competitive play,but that's not it either,if you take le blanc the entire community hates her(ergo her 3rd/4th spot on the banrate scale),on top of it as of now both she and zed are considered very strong,and for zed I'm 100% sure he will stay that way,le blanc on the other hand has severe gameplay issues,you would know that if you actually played against diamond le blancs.\n\nBlitzcrank had 55% winrate in diamond so I'm guessing he got nerfed for the same reason amumu got nerfed before,well or maybe because he's obnoxious,hard to tell here.\n\n>Players like you are the reason why this game is turning complete and utter shit. Sorry your champion cannot defeat every damn support and adc in the game, if you get countered you get countered, boohoo. Everyone has counter-picks.\n\nExcept that the tanks supports aren't their counters,zyra used to be picked into thresh all the time,now nobody even touches her,it's not even that,even if you were right about this(and you are definitely not) having counters is a weakness,where are her strengths to offset that?\nAnd don't start with her damage,it's not worth being walked over by any half competant support and adc,and if you could walk over kalista with certain picks as hard as she walks over others herself that would be fine too,but she doesn't,no,I'm afraid,it's people like you who are turning this game into complete and utter shit,you want all these amazing strengths,and being able to counter a lot of things,but you refuse to have any meaningful weakness to offset that,that is the sin of kalista/thresh/zed(and quite frankly,most(not all) of the meta picks).\n\n>Its a wonder carries such as Varus don't get played very often in this meta, his poke is real and with how strong

tanks to get deleted/moved to top where they belong\n\nThey aren't inherently bad,they are just sort of overtuned at the moment,It's not just that,at this point of shitty balancing they are a necessary evil.\n\nWhy? because riot just kept buffing adcs,including their early game,if tank supports would be just magically forbbiden from going bot lane the first thing you are going to ask yourself is: \"why in the bloody hell is this lucian/graves/draven/'take your pick' able to outrade me at level 1? isn't he supposed to be some hyper scaling adc?\" then he get's a bf and getting closer to him isn't worth it,he outtrades you hard,easily and then heals it up with lifesteal,tank supports maintain relevance as they are harder for the enemy adc to poke down and burst,and maintain relevance for much longer through kill potential,the problem is deeply rooted in bot lane right now,removing tank support will raise an issue with the early game of adcs,that's a very deep issue with riot's balancing,they keep on building on existing problems and making things worse instead of realzing something is stupid and dealing with it before it's rooted so deeply you just can't remove it effectively anymore*.\n\n*Take tank junglers for example,the purpose and sense in tank junglers(note not bruisers,idc if mundo goes full tank,he's a bruiser,bruisers bring bulk and damage,tanks bring bulk and cc) is that they are focused on cc(ergo initiation,peel and lockdown) yet cinderhulk(and the latest changes to sejuani/naut) makes them deal damage,and we all know sejuani is pretty strong 1v1,that's not sensible,but riot kept ignoring and building on top of the issues carry junglers cause there was just no other way to make tank junglers relevant

I can't deny the usefulness of an effective Kalista, but many of the ones I see at my level mean trouble. My guess is they are just new to the champ and get themselves in trouble with the passive, or panic and use the ult as a emergency button for themselves rather than for their support. I guess you have to practice somewhere, and you can't always queue up with a friend. \n\nClearly, the fault must lay at least partially on me if I have trouble learning to support Kalistas, but it is wearisome. By the power of the self-confirming bias, I've gotten myself to a point where I trust unfamiliar Kalistas about as much as I do unfamiliar Vaynes, which is unfortunate. I think Kalista was founded on a really cool concept of co-dependence, and I would love to see that work out, but I have a very hard time liking a champ who so often makes my lane feel like a 1v3.\n\nMay I ask how you work with Kalista, both in terms of game mechanics and communicating with the player? For context, I usually take Leona or Taric into a Kalista, but sometimes wind up as Soraka, Zyra, or Nami if I can't respond to their pick for whatever reason.","replies":[{"poster":"FirstSergeantBim","date":"2015-04-27T21:22:53.089+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel your pain, lol.  It can be hit or miss with any champ and you just never really know what's going to happen.  Sometimes you just have to trust, but a quick stats check on League's Match History or LOLNexus can either quell my worries or encourage my dodge, but I make it a point to chat quite a bit in the pre-game just to get everyone on the same page.  \n\nEspecially when I'm support, I'm constantly chatting and pinging.  Since my role is much less mechanically intensive, I can pay more attention to map objectives and our opponent's strengths and weaknesses.  The vast majority of my games as a support, I feel like a coach.  Worst case scenario you tell your team what they already know, best case scenario you avoid serious casualties.  No harm in speaking your mind as long as you are approaching the team properly.  \n\nI like to say \"we need this\" or \"if this, then this\" type of chat instead of direct commands because I think it's more constructive.  _\"We need to watch that Talon's roam, we can't let him get any bigger.\"  \"We need everyone to upgrade their trinkets, they're roaming really well and bot-lane can't respond to the pressure.\"_  If anyone else follows through with your \"requests\", thank them or tell them good job.  It's kind of amazing what can happen as long as someone stays positive, gives constructive input and can follow that up with good plays.  \n\nAs far as working with Kalista goes, I think laying down some guidelines at the beginning of the match can work wonders.  Those guidelines are all pretty circumstantial, so it's up to you to determine what your needs are in response to the enemy team.  For instance, I like to play Soraka support and even though Soraka doesn't carry an extra cheesy engage like an Alistar or a Sion, that get out of jail free card for Soraka can be game-changing.  It's okay if you aren't the \"ideal\" support for Kali, her kit is so universal anything can work.  \n\nI don't want my Kali to use me as an engage, but I would be okay with a re-engage under the right circumstances.  So I tell them, but I make sure they know our number one priority is keeping me safe, not putting me in danger so she can't be upset if she picks me up expecting a Raka dive only to see me fly out in the opposite direction.  Since I'll be playing pretty far back, I might also tell Kali not to worry about ranking her W up since I'll rarely be close enough to make use of it.  If you want vision in a particular area, but don't have a ward, ask for a Sentinal.  Kali's Sentinels are a godsend, but most players don't have the presence of mind to use them properly, that's where you come in.  They're great for covering area early on when trinket wards are down.  For instance, if you and Kali are pushed into your tower, ask her to send a Sentinel through the bot-lane brush so you know the enemy jungler didn't sneak in when you didn't have vision.  I might also tell them that we need to bait the Ignite out of the Thresh before we can go ham in lane, but once that Ignite is gone I want her to unload on Thresh if he so much as looks at us funny because we will always win trades as long as Kali doesn't die.  Once you have a pretty good idea of your game-plan going into lane, communicating your needs and carrying them out becomes pretty fun, I think.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jefftiffy","date":"2015-04-26T05:12:44.099+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jelly Mac,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EZgN6GqQ,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-04-26T04:34:02.783+0000)\n>\n> She isn't OP, she is just extremely aggravating to play against.\n> \n> Like a new {{champion:17}}.\n\nExcept that with Runaan's and boots she gets about a 2.0 AS meaning 2 dashes per second and 2 E procs per second on top of Runaan's damage increase and AoE.\n\nAnd her ult really should be swapped to the reverse situation where she pulls herself to the support instead so it is actually effected by CC.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Brotha","date":"2015-04-26T19:28:54.166+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember when Lucian was permanently dashing around and we HAD to nerf him right back to hell.\n\nPeople had so much fun abusing it that they made a champion who does the same exact shit, just with better cc, objective control, and % health damage.\n\nI'd personally like her gutted, but since her niche is infinite dashing she should get a range nerf.
