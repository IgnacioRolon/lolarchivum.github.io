Read for context\n\nIf you compare the last 20 champs to say, the 20 before that, it looks pretty obvious that mobility creep went from some champs to all but 1 in 20 (with two that are on the fence)\n\n\nIf we include the new champ in the 20, all 20 but 1 (Vel) have some form of mobility and 2 are barely counting (Braum and Jinx), some more than others in the form of actual dashes.\n\nIn the previous 20, the ones that have mobility\n\n- Kha\n- Rengar\n- Diana (It relies on her ult, but will still count it for the sake of argument)\n- Hecarim\n- Lulu - she does have a decent speed boost\n- Fiora - Hard to argue, as the ability even has the word dash in the description\n- Ziggs - Gonna count Satchel Charge because I know someone will argue it otherwise\n- Sejuani - Does have a dash\n- Ahri - Yup\n- Voli - Sort of, a speed up, but it does get pretty significant at later levels, so counting it\n- Fizz \n- Shyvana - I wouldn't call it significant, but her ult works pretty well, and she does have a speed boost, and they are free, so that in noteworthy.\n\n\nChamps that sort of ish have movement\n\n- Jayce - He gets a boost from changing forms that is trivial at best, and he does have a short range \"dunk\", so sort of\n- Draven - I guess this is in the...sort of category, if you want to count a meh 1.5 second speed up, but again, for sake of argument\n- Nautilus - This one is 50/50, but his anchor can grab walls, so...sort of?\n\nIn the previous 20, the ones that don't\n\n- Syndra\n- Zyra\n- Darius Nothing here really. He has a sort of pull, and can dunk but is basically melee range, so not counting any of that\n- Varus\n- Viktor\n\nSo, out of 20 champs currently, 1 has zero movement speed increasing abilities and 2 barely do, in Braum with dashing to allied champs/minions, and Jinx who only does with kills on towers/camps, and assists. In the previous 20, there were 5 that didn't,  and 3 that only sort of count.\n\nSo we go from 12 out of 20 that do have mobility, to about 17 out of 20 (not 100% sold on Braum mobility, but I can see the argument for it, and Jinx' is a bit too circumstance dependant, so I can't really count it at all).\n\nEither way, that is a significant jump.  60% up to (if we don't count Braum) 85% of champs. That seems pretty much like mobility creep and then some. \n\nA 25% increase...","replies":[{"poster":"The Soulforged","date":"2015-05-19T23:25:50.460+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Forgot Jayce's acceleration gate.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-05-19T06:40:37.091+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"With {{champion:266}} it isn't just that his dash has a long animation... it is also the fact that he needs to finish most of the animation before he even moves...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TH Exarthious","date":"2015-05-19T04:59:47.632+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play a lot of supports, and it is painful watching your team move away from you so fast you find it hard if not impossible to keep up.

And pushing the lane under turret makes it harder for most enemies to farm, and if she is pushed under turret she has no problem securing all the minions, even with turret fire being there. Hurricane does equal more farm (though not by as much as suggested) but it is more important for the \"control\" it gives, farming plus poking, lane freezing, pushing, holding a position. Plus the AS gives makes her incredibly hard to catch quite early. Personally I prefer Btok then Hurricane, but usually by the time \"most\" build Hurricane the laning is over or at least one or two turrets down. So her ability to pop away, clear a wave then get back to the team (+ she has vision skills already) makes it very viable as an early item. Still, 2nd or 3rd is better, but it's not bad as first","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ZombieNinja War","date":"2015-05-19T15:19:53.543+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"This post makes it seem like Dash or Blink is something new that riot is doing. 8 of the first 20 champs have this too... so what. a lot of champions have a form of dash.","replies":[{"poster":"Xonra","date":"2015-05-19T20:23:45.763+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ZombieNinja War,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=i2kqXPx7,comment-id=0015,timestamp=2015-05-19T15:19:53.543+0000)\n>\n> This post makes it seem like Dash or Blink is something new that riot is doing. 8 of the first 20 champs have this too... so what. a lot of champions have a form of dash.\n\n8 of the first 20 compared to 17 of the most recent 20\n\nI think you just proved the point of \"mobility creep\" with your response.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Karen Kujo","date":"2015-05-19T05:08:29.766+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":5,"body":"And Jinx is the most broken of the last 20, what's the point","replies":[{"poster":"IceKingChernobog","date":"2015-05-19T07:33:37.508+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"thats a strange way to spell {{champion:429}}","replies":[{"poster":"demonsnake420","date":"2015-05-19T08:24:32.398+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"The win-rates for the past month would beg to differ.

Then there is Kalista... It often ends up being a case of simply completely outclassing similar champs and the design is catered around being very effective in the current environment in some way which sucks since this leaves majority of the roster in the dust. I'm sure tournament play has some impact on this \"because its cool\" which makes sense to some degree, I just don't agree with how out of hand it is.\n\nI am totally cool with the flash boot option but I do believe some summoners would have to be adjusted to make it not overwhelming since they would now have an extra summoner for survivability. It would certainly help champs like Galio and promote more interesting play strats since there would be more variety in summoners considering flash is takin almost 100% of the time.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Insulant","date":"2015-05-19T19:21:52.319+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree like w kalista too there is way too much mobility.Its drowning out some of the good adc w no mobility i love like VARUS..","replies":[]},{"poster":"R2D20","date":"2015-05-19T15:59:35.867+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:412}} can dash with his hook...","replies":[]}]}
