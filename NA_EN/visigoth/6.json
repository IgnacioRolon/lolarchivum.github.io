This is almost never correct.  First of all, giving someone a 2-4 kill streak is better than giving a penta, because their shut down is worth more per kill.  Second, even with assists, the only times giving the penta is potentially worth it, gold wise, are when your whole team is on a massive death streak, in which case, your odds of getting the shutdown are stupidly low.\n\nHere's some mechanics for you:\nKill gold is based on kill streak length:\n1: 300\n2: 350 (+50)\n3: 408 (+58)\n4: 475 (+67)\n5: 500 (+25)\n\nTo clarify, this gold total includes the base 300.  The maximum you can get for a kill is 500.  It is not cumulative.  \n\nAssist gold is always half the kill gold.  It'll be split between everyone who got assists.  You get an additional bonus in assist gold for having more assists than kills:\n+1: +0\n+2: +30\n+3: +45\n+4: +60\n\nAdditionally, this bonus cannot be more than the kill's value, which is only the case if the player was on a 9+ death streak.\n\nDeath streak value:\n1: 300\n2: 275 (-25)\n3: 220 (-55)\n4: 176 (-44)\n5: 141 (-35)\n6: 112 (-29)\n7: 90 (-22)\n8: 72 (-18)\n9 58 (-14)\neventually, capping at 50 gold\n\nIn a normal scenario, everyone is worth 300 gold.  No one has a shut down bonus.  Enemy carry picks up 4 kills.  He's now up 1200g, but his bounty is now 475 (+175 over a normal kill).  Assuming he just 1v5'd, which would generate just the kill gold, he has 1200 extra gold for himself, but even if you kill him, he's only worth 943.5g total for your team if you kill him, in a best case scenario, meaning everyone on your team has 4 more assists than kills, and everyone gets an assist.  This means, the killer gets the 475 shutdown, and each assist is worth the (228.5+60*4)/4, or 117 per assist.  Assuming you get the kill in this case, which is pretty favored toward your team, you are down 256.5g.\n\nBut what if you give up that penta?  Well, your enemy carry now has 1500g, and his bounty is now 500 (+200 over a normal kill).  Again, assuming he 1v5s, and you get all 4 assists when you kill him back, you only get 990g back.  Your team is instead down 510 from this trade.  By giving up the 5th kill, you've just doubled the effective gold gain to the enemy team.  This is of course assuming they didn't get assists.  \n\nThe only time this is worth it, is if most of your team is on a 2-3 death losing streak.  Your deaths need to give the carry 198 or less gold on average to be worth it FOR THIS PENTA.  Of course, odds are, you won't get that.  Ever.  The enemy team will get assists.  Getting to that point requires sicking so deep you can't practically win against players at your level.  \n\nWhat if there's at least 1 assist generated on each kill?  Everyone is then worth 450 gold assuming they aren't feeding.  Going from the quad to penta is about a 412 gold loss to add 37 gold to the enemy's shutdown value.  \n\nGiving the 5th kill is not ever worth it in any practical sense, disregarding extreme cases that are either rare or a guaranteed loss.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LeeDark","date":"2015-04-03T09:38:57.881+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dying to the other enemy is good for your enemies, so why did you do it?","replies":[{"poster":"venom014","date":"2015-04-04T14:55:55.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because he was dead anyways, so he died to the shen instead of giving up a penta kill","replies":[{"poster":"LeeDark","date":"2015-04-04T21:34:26.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, he THINKS he was dead anyway.
