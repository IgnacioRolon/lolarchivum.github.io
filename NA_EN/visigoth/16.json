You can&#039;t just let a champion have tons of free damage reduction so the build full damage and can tank, or have so much base damage they build full tank and melt everyone.\r\n\r\nSeriously, look at Garen-- Super tanky, but literally no damage at all. Balanced champion. Look at Draven, metric fuckton of damage, but at the cost of little utility and being able to be zoned away from axes. Balanced.\r\n\r\nNow look at past mistakes. Kha&#039;Zix, full damage, goes invis to take 50% reduced damage. Lead to him eventually getting gutted. Akali had a similar mechanic on her W, led to a few nerfs and resulted in making her kit clunky as hell. I don&#039;t need to talk about Olaf or Elise.\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\nRiot, don&#039;t do this to Rek&#039;Sai. You already gutted her damage so she can&#039;t be a bruiser, you can&#039;t gut her utility. That literally leaves her to be a meat shield.  You&#039;re going to nerf her to the point where she is pretty much Mundo 2.0 who just sits there absorbing hits for your carry, and in an actual fight is just a minor inconvenience.","replies":[{"poster":"insaiyanbacca","date":"2015-06-28T20:53:14.424+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":0,"body":"thing is mundo hurts more then rek most of the time honestly","replies":[]},{"poster":"BewmBewmVi","date":"2015-06-28T23:37:10.055+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":1,"body":"Garen no damage?
