Anyone who supports with him knows he has some mana management issues, and if you don't pull off your ganks, you are virtually useless. You'll fall off real quick. Trust me, I tried it before and you have to practice a lot to get his clearing good and get ganks to go perfectly.\n\nI don't really know what nerfs you're referring to... which patch was it? I don't actually remember seeing anything in this patch for Alistar, but I could be wrong. I know a while ago people in the lcs were using him top because if you were quick enough I think you could headbutt, auto attack, and pulverize at the same time... I think, but I could be wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Sailor Mint","date":"2015-03-21T00:59:11.249+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alistar jungle was a Season 2 thing.\n\nIt's best left forgotten.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Dusteon","date":"2015-03-20T23:51:21.394+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alistar was nerfed because he literally came from YOUR turret, knocked you away, and there was nothing you could do to stop him.
