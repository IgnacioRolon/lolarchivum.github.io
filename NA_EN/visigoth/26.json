This monster could give you vision of the area and in the case of monsters like Gromp or Wolves, it also has a version of its own buff tied to it (So Gromp has his poison on attack and Wolf would have a greater vision range).\n\nThis makes it so you can use this monster in a gank, or for farming your jungle, or for setting a trap for your enemy jungler by having this monster give you vision and then work with you to attack them in their jungle. It could just use the simple mechanic that Annie has for controlling Tibbers since all monsters basically just use auto attacks to fight.","replies":[{"poster":"Orbv","date":"2015-06-22T13:31:44.472+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I like the idea of it becoming a non-neutral monster, but I don't think control is the way to go.

This would give it some real identity.\n\nSomething like... killing neutrals in the enemy jungle (after smiting).... the next time after respawn and they are smitten by opponent or are killed , you get the smite buff for it (as well as not giving the opponent a buff for smiting it)\n\nThis would make counterjungling truly rewarding. Not only by messing with their camps THAT time (by stealing their gold/exp and forcing them to wait for respawn), but by leaving a lasting impression for when they actually do respawn. Think about it, you smite their wolves and a few minutes later they kill them again, giving you another wolf ghost. That would be actually WORTH buying that smite upgrade. Or choosing to spec into the this particular jungle item over the others to deny their gromp buff against a tank jungler, and taking it for yourself. Same thing with the vision proc on Razorbeaks. So much strategic advantage out of counterjungling like this, while you lose the ability to smite champions (if you would have bought chilling or skirmisher) and don't get the sustain/aoe/stun from Trailblazers. It would give it an actual role with huge downsides too since it would have zero combat potential (even trailblazer has combat potential, smiting a neutral in the jungle for the sustain during a fight can be huge, especially if you are trying to steal red and get both the healing effects).\n\nNote that I would suggest against stealing the actual red/blue buffs if they are killed later, but still keeping the smite buff from them (hp and mana restore) and keep it uninteractive with scuttle and epics.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OyddAWqJ5r","date":"2015-06-22T16:01:53.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Specter's Dagger](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/pExqMm5F-poachers-knife-to-summon-specters-of-the-slain-monster-and-renaming-the-item)\n\nMost of the credit for the idea is yours since I essentially just copied your overall idea and added detail.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChaosThief","date":"2015-06-22T00:17:58.617+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"They should make the smite bonus apply to your own jungle, to make it rewarding for speed clear champions to pick.","replies":[{"poster":"What Is Smite","date":"2015-06-22T01:08:20.431+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ranger's Trailblazer does a better Job with it's Aoe blast and stun making better for both normal jungling and counter-jungling since you can clear the camps faster than the enemy can","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosThief","date":"2015-06-22T01:31:10.172+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Poacher's knife, if it applied to your own jungle, would provide bonus gold instead of a faster clear.\n\nSo it would be a trade off.","replies":[{"poster":"What Is Smite","date":"2015-06-22T05:11:24.279+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That would be a decent trade off since the item would pay for itself much faster but that would just put it on par with the other smites, the real issue is if it would be worth getting when you enchant the jungle item since usually you see Challenger's and Chilling more often than not and then Ranger's shows up sparsely with an enchant in the majority of games","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosThief","date":"2015-06-22T15:52:11.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you implying you want poacher's knife to be broken?

You get caught out in the enemy jungle? Doesn't matter, you as much, if not more gold, from the camp you stole (eventually more because of death bounties) and the enemy jungler is down a camp.

Other problems Poacher's has include, but are not limited to:\n\n-It's useless if you are behind. Stalker's and Skirmisher's both give extra combat presence, while Ranger's gives extra sustain so you can impact the map more and waveclear when you need it. Poacher's does nothing on your own jungle creeps and does nothing to enemy champions.\n\n-It's not as useful when you are ahead. Stalker's and Skirmisher's give extra combat presence to snowball leads, Ranger's gives extra sustain to push for objectives or kills farther, but being ahead means that the enemy jungle is at the mercy of your entire team, and you are not guaranteed to get value out of Poacher's Knife.\n\nI probably missed a few reasons (there are a whole lot more reasons to not get Poacher's Knife, but I can't think of a whole lot more that haven't been mentioned), but these two reasons and it telegraphing how you are going to play the game are to two biggest issues with the item.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vibrating Hotdog","date":"2015-06-22T16:26:24.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So does this mean that {{item:3721}} is the best item on {{champion:20}} jungle?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2015-06-22T15:55:16.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe Poacher's Knife could give the current bonus, but also shroud your items, making them unable to be seen or something like that.
