Yes it is hilarious, but not for this game.  While there is lots of cheese and suggestive content already, this is explicit and there is no doubt about it.  Want to make her a whore? , Fine but she is supposed to be mature and classy, not some high schooler going out on Halloween every day. \n\nI play league in a room dedicated to gaming with my twin brother (born gaming sis-bro!), so countless times when I&#039;m always using my speakers to get the best experience, our younger sister always regurgitates Annie and Lissandra&#039;s voice and laugh, respectively.    When I would go on an Evelynn grind,  my mother would pass by saying &quot;that character is crazy sounding, but scary in a way&quot;.   Then the annoying habit came that weekend when she would repeat   &quot;the dike is my veil&quot; ..... can you imagine what she&#039;d take from the current vx on the PBE?  Oh my I don&#039;t even want to think about it. \n\nSo, as I am a 27- yrs old lady here - i K Now  what it is to have countless games feature seductive female characters.  I just wish Ev isn&#039;t the next one on the list and they fix her.  You all have to be even before you can release something like this?  No, Taric isn&#039;t the equivalent to a whore.  As flamboyant as you want him, he is still decent.    Where is the skinny guy with the big package and g-string in this game?  That&#039;s what I thought.   I don&#039;t see male characters being objectified in this game as they should if you wanna keep doing this to classic champions like Evelynn.   (no Rak&aacute;n, Ahri talking about you doesn&#039;t make you an object) .  \n\nPlease save this for another lady of pleasure champion.  Evelynn is supposed to be seductive, not &quot;let him have everything there and then&quot;.  That&#039;s not how seduction work, it&#039;s more of a loose tug of war. How can she so revealing....... when she is a concealing assassin?  LIke wtf. ^____^   Oh and the reason for the rework was so that she did not tower dive so easily and survive by bursting under tower then simply walking away--- did the developers forget because now she is definitely going for that play style specifically with this kit.    Btw, her walking is supposed to be front-forward like the classic Ev, not immature Miss Fortune or Start Guardian Ahri where is seems something is stuck up there. \n\nThanks for the love and I&#039;d like to hear all of y&#039;all&#039;s  thoughts &lt;3.      \n\nP.S.  Anyone else have a sibling that mimics Annie!?","replies":[{"poster":"Rand0mH3r0X","date":"2017-09-30T23:08:58.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But ($$) it ($) fits ($$$) the ($$) theme!
