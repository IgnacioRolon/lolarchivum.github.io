Because the League client interacts with a ton of files outside of the League installation folder, it requires specific permission to be able to do so. This is why assigning proper system permissions to League is so important for it to run properly. \n\nI'm glad to hear you found a fix, let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Eldereon","date":"2016-08-15T01:33:42.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But what changed between yesterday and today that I now need to run it as an admin?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-15T15:47:55.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your system's files change all the time, and certain files League relies on could have moved, requiring League to now have administrative permissions to reach those files again.
