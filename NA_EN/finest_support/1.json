Second again it depends on who you are matched with or against.\n\nWhat i have found when trying to split push is when you have horrible teammates they simply fall over without you. You wont even make it to the tower before their team rotates towards after mopping up your team.\n\nIn bronze, split pushing works a little to well(almost freelo there) but in silver if you get people who should be in bronze on the enemy team its effective otherwise its not. Which again leads to my original point and problem with Silver, its the default elo for new players.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tuition Fee","date":"2018-07-08T01:10:58.125+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Issues that I experience:\n-The guy who has placed seven wards in a 40 minute game and constantly complains about dying to enemy team when he face checks bush\n-Full AP supports who complain about their 1/4 ADC, not realizing the ADC has 14 assists on the kills that the support took\n-AFK farming junglers who don't touch objectives or ward\n-People taking roles hostage\n-Getting one shotted by Talon/Yasuo/LB despite having a three kill lead :( Wards really don't do much at this point, their gap closers+damage are incredible\n-Very bad picks, such as playing a squishy mage like Lux in top lane against assassin/bruiser\n-People playing ranged champions at melee range\n-Supports who like to fight in the front line while their ADC gets fucked by an assassin \n-People who get angry at you for backing out of a fight and staying alive while the rest of the team dies in a four man Yasuo ult.. if you don't die with them, you are at fault, apparently.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDevice","date":"2018-07-08T08:17:26.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whats funny is you say \"those people\". those are the people I get on my team.

Can't really be helped. \n\nAs for me, Riot can give me about five games in a row (I've actually had 17 once) where every teammate fed every game and I had a bout 4 d/c ers to my enamies 1. \n\nIf you are prone to getting afkers and d/cers on your team, you actually cant rank up. Think about it, if you average more d/cers than the enemy, its impossible to rank because you can't win enough games that way. Say you get unlucky and get three games in a row with feeders every 5 games but you're getting a dc also one of those five, and say ONe game you happen to do bad, just one. thats five games you are losing to five you are winning. Now in my case, I get about five or six straight games of feeders on my team. Afterward, I get like MAYBE five games that seem fair. Throw in my higher rate of d/cers and it's LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE to rank up.\n\nPeople will say as they push their glasses up to their eyes, \"Well the enemy should be getting just as many dcers and feeders on average *snort* so yeah you should be winning, sir\".
