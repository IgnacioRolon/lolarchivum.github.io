Today was the day it was to become available. I have been sitting here all day clicking this button every 5 minutes, in hopes that I actually manage to get it. \r\nI wouldn't be mad if I didn't. I understood that it was a name many others were probably wanting as well. \r\n\r\nWho got it? A brand new level 1 account. \r\nThere is a large chance that this person(or bot) is only planning to sell the name. It's not going to someone that wants it and put money into the game to get it. This is flat-out unfair to not only myself, but anyone else who was wanting the name. \r\n\r\nI made a support ticket but I'm sure I'll just get some sort of copy/paste response, so I'm posting here as a bit of a cry for help. I'm not sure if anything could be done about it now, but is it not possible to take away the name from the level 1 account that should have never had it in the first place?","replies":[{"poster":"Rebel","date":"2016-11-16T01:14:10.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is tricky because you don't really know if it's the original owner who claimed it on a different account or if it's some random botter. I've been using various name checking sites to find good names for myself and friends and came to realize that the names were released on a pretty common time pattern (I've seen names become available myself over time on numerous occasions, and got Rebel that way last month). \"Dragon\" did not hit the pattern nor the date it was supposed to release on. It's supposed to open up tomorrow, actually, at least from the patterns I've seen. So it could be the owner of the account that came back and swapped it over but that indeed is very unlikely. I'm guessing it's a bot but no clue how bots work either, I just do it manually and spam click on the time pattern to see if I get it. The account owner's email is notified when their summoner name is about to be available from the cleanup, so I won't doubt it if the guy just took it back, I mean. \n\nJust my thoughts from what I've seen. I've been trying to get names for so long and ended up learning the time when they are usually released, so I don't think the idea of the original owner coming back isn't that far out- I've seen it happen a few times.\n\nSorry you couldn't get it though. Hope you can find other cool names and if you don't have the site to check names I can give you some.","replies":[{"poster":"Yiffy","date":"2016-11-16T01:17:46.284+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"After all that time of not playing, I wouldn't think the person would make a new account just to take it on a level 1 account (Which is not suppose to be possible) when they could simply log into their main account. \nThe fact that Riot says that new, fresh level 1 accounts are unable to take these sorts of names then allow them to do so anyways baffles me.","replies":[{"poster":"Yiffy","date":"2016-11-16T01:18:34.222+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"(It previously belonged to a Season 4 diamond player who has not played since.

On the site I linked, it mentions that new accounts are unable to claim names that are cleaned up from inactivity, however this is a fresh level 1 account that has taken it.

I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if they could release the name early so it wouldn't be contested, but it's still not fair.\n\nAlso, the name Todd also became available today. Dragon and Todd played 1 bot game together and that was it. So I wonder if they're just smurfs who got lucky, or if they were botting to get the names, and then playing a game so they wouldn't be deemed \"inactive\" so they can sell them.","replies":[{"poster":"Dzifzar","date":"2016-11-16T09:58:43.385+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To update on this --- I found \"Todd\" for sale, but not Dragon.\nName 'Todd' for sale - https://www.%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%/lol/account/o!124503928/\nAnd all name sales I could find were here.

A level 1, who played one game. I was really pissed! And I immediately thought, yeah, it was a bot and someone's gonna try and sell it. We can only hope that if it becomes something like that, that Riot can deal with, we'll have the opportunity again to try for it. Cheers, mate!","replies":[]}]}
