Do you have any idea how to give compensation? It's not by nerfing his damage across the board, giving him a slightly longer cooldown on Q, and completely demolishing any chance for him to land EITHER HIS W OR E!\n\n\nTell me. Seriously, tell me. How high was the entirety of the balance team when they made these changes? I wanted to believe. Believe that Riot had an idea as to what they were doing with their champion pool, believe that the balance team knows how to  do their JOB, ***cough** {{champion:429}}  **cough** {{champion:64}}  **cough***, Yet time, and time, and time, and TIME AGAIN you've proven that you don't know what you want.\n\n\nDo you know where 90% of Veigars damage came from? Do ya? Deathfire Grasp. Do you know what countered Veigars E? MOBILITY! Do you know what EVERY CHAMPION RECENTLY RELEASED UNDER THE SUN HAS?! A metric fuckton of mobility. (Due note that these are slight over-statements purposes, as mobility cannot be measured by weight, much less 1000 Kg of weight.)\n\n\nI am perfectly fine with his Q being a skill-shot. I think it SHOULD have been a skillshot from the start. His W? Massive delay that does okay damage for the delay. His E was countered by mobility and mobility is what everyone has nowadays. His biggest counters were mobile and long range mages. The people he countered the hardest were the immobile mages.\n\nNow? The fuck's he got? a 3/4 second delay on his stun, guess what? That's a massive delay. Most teamfights last maybe 4 seconds, so almost a quarter of that fight his E is getting ready- aaaand Veigar is dead because he couldn't stun the Assassin who burst him.\n\n\n\n\n\n **Tl:dr. Riot doesn't seem to know what compensation means; broke another promise. Angry Veigar fan rant. You don't miss much by only reading this part, just a lot of rage.**\n\nFor those wondering.

And to be honest, Veigar was my first mage. He was the funnest champion I still play today. He's one of the very few able to beat Katarina and he is not as easy as a lot of the new mid champs. Sure, he has power, but with all the burst champs like Ahri, Akili, Azir, Fizz and many others can do it in an instant, his stun was his only instant stop to that. I congratulate Riot. I never knew they could be this dull. If only there were some way for Riot to know how we as the community feel about these changes.\n\nEdit:\n\nOkay, I tried him on the PBE. He's actually not that different. The added 0.75 seconds aren't noticeable but the circle before the cast is. That's what will annoy me. It seems they just added 0.25 seconds or less to a 0.5 second cast time because I'm not sure he's always had an insta stun, because we've never seen partial effects before his stun before.

My E was outran by a *Zyra.*  Y'know, that champ with the **lowest movement speed in the game**? The Q is a nice addition, but any enemy with a brain will zone you to hell *and* it's impossible to burst down a champion if there's minions between you. Then once laning's over and you're just farming random waves, you can seriously feel the extra second on Baleful Strike's cooldown. All Dark Matter is good for with this rework is getting caster minions low so you can fire Q's through the melee ones. On top of that, the Q range isn't even far enough to pierce through to the backline of a minion wave anyway. Fortunately, Primordial Burst still feels strong, but only against squishy AP champs. Otherwise it just feels incredibly weak. All in all, I rate this rework Stashu/10. \n\nAlright, maybe that's going a bit too far. The ideas behind it are good (unlike that of a certain Snakelady's rework), such as Q being a piercing skillshot and E having a delay (though 0.75 is way *waaaay* too long.

Even mobile champions could be outplayed by a Veigar that could land his E. It was balanced because that was Veigar's only defensive option- he can't run from anyone with mobility, he can't dodge CC, he has no other CC with which to aid his escape (or enable his W- to allow it to do damage to anything other than minions/monsters).\n\nWith the E delay, Veigar will have trouble against even the most immobile champions because they will be able to leave the cage or stay in it, meaning they will still be able to move and dodge W.\n\nVeigar's W is about to become a waste of an ability because it will be impossible to land on anyone, mobile or not, and Veigar himself is about to become obsolete because his only anti-meta (anti-mobility) tool is going to be severely crippled.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2015-02-14T00:32:22.306+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":1,"body":"Veigar needs an instant stun because his W is balanced around it.

Stun where the ONLY counterplay is that you can survive IF veigar can't hit it. Even his W was lacking counter play. W and stun? Hope you have tenacity boot or you're gonna eat up tons of damage.\n> I don't see any problem in the veigars changes.\n\nIf you think Veigar had no counterplay, in a post where you literally list at least one thing that counters him (and pretty hard, to boot), I have to wonder how you manage to breathe.

Or that in a  AOE team fight it doesn't really matter if he hit anyone since  his stun works as an engage and disengage.\nHey, guess what, you have to buy tenacity boots vs him or you will eat W for free every stun. \nAh, QSS, the defensive item that every mid build early.\nIt isn't like during lane phase he will poke you so he can Q+R you for the kill. No no no.. there is only one to play veigar, you must burst 0/100 .\n\nSure, E nerf will give counter play to a kit that has almost any and will make veigar even weaker VS mobile.\n\nBut hey, it's better to say \"ononononon you dumb, me smart, riot don't know what doing!\".\n\nEvery single champions that riot is revisiting they are putting counterplay inside their kit, LB got her silence removed, talon got his silence removed, kass got his silence removed, syndra got a width nerf because of her ranged aoe stun....  Veigar R still is one of the most OP assassins ult in the game VS ap champs, being ranged and point and click., being the only counter play is a well placed zonyha.","replies":[{"poster":"chumbler","date":"2015-02-14T09:26:57.666+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cenobite Azaziel,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=K2oVEU00,comment-id=002800010000,timestamp=2015-02-14T09:25:02.146+0000)\n>\n> Hey I guess it's easy to play against people that don't main veigar.\n> It isn't like his E played by a skilled player is a point and click stun.

And sure, in theory, all you had to do was line up the circle and push the button. In practice, it was very easy to miss, either because you panicked or because you misjudged exactly how the curved shape fit over the enemies' hitboxes.\n\nI'm open to the idea of changing his stun, personally, because trying to land that stupid, well, *skillshot* was never much fun for me. It felt difficult, but not in a rewarding or exciting way, just in an awkward way. But they haven't changed it so much as made it so that now you always miss.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
