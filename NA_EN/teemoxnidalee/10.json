People don't stop being unable to get bursted late game, especially from Lux. \n\nGutting a stage that she is already weak in doesn't change anything about her late game except make her a pain in the ass for the player to use and to actually get to that point in the game, she begins to crumble if she can't secure an early game.\n\n> A direct nerf for lux would probably kill her, she is on a knifes edge as it is. so it would nee dto be a fairly neutral nerf.\n> The way to do this would probably end up being a change on her q, as it is currently a one point wonder skill, and those are unhealthy anyway.\n\nA direct nerf is not lowering her ult cooldown, or requiring her E some ramp up time. A direct nerf is stripping her Q's power from her.\n\nYou mention one point wonder being her Q, but I don't think you even know about this entirely either, OPW are not inherently bad, they had consistency element to champions to allow easier balance, They just recently for example made {{champion:12}}  W + Q combo have a buffer, so it can be done consistently now, this means Ali can be buffed or changed without having an inconsistent nature like IF a player can land that combo well, just like Lux will be harder to balance because it stops being IF they land a skillshot and becomes, IF they land a skillshot and IF they are leveling up Q, it adds problems to her kit.\n\nMake the Q change go through, what stops her from being completely bullied and stomped all of the laning phase? a 0.75 second root or whatever won't do anything for her anymore, and forcing a player to choose between better farm and some safety is just a poor experience and makes her unfun. There are so many other places to tone her down without causing these problems.\n\nAnd if you consider someone who has been sitting on the higher end of playrate/winrate for a few patches now on \"The knifes edge\" you need to rethink the meaning of that term.\n\n> Her damage is actually tuned to be about where it should be, so the only option is to reduce her safety.\n> this is the best way to reduce her safety in a small manner, to make it so that lux can still farm, still be abel to avoid ganks, still be able to make most of her plays, without losing any of her main traits. she would still be relatively safe, and she would still have most of what she needs to succeed.\n\nHer damage isn't what's being suggested for a nerf, it's how often she can do the damage, and there is a BIG difference. \n\nHer Ult does the same damage with a longer cooldown, just now it won't be spammable by her, and she has to actually make the conscience thought on whether she should save her ult or not. \n\nHer E ramps up now, because an AOE slow, high damaging, long range, instant damaging is complete bullshit at times. Making it require her to position it properly to maximize potential damage, doesn't reduce it's damage it just means she doesn't have assloads on hand regardless of her skill. \n\nChanging her W to not re-apply or just not shield as much, isn't even touching her damage, it's just lowering the annoyances she brings onto enemies, apply it once. Good, it's a nice little shield for her team, reapplying it right away is just a pain in the ass.\n\n> on another relevant note, I'm like 90% certain that people like you are the reason why riot doesn't communicate with the playerbase. always complaining about things without even thinking about the ramifications of other changes. exclusively saying ideas are bad without following up with why.\n\nOh that's rich.

That is fine to you, SERIOUSLY?\n\nCharging her E is not a several second ramp up, at most it lasts 2 seconds to hit max damage, meaning her Q + E + Ult + AA combo is still perfectly viable, but reduces her poke damage. \n\nAnd finally, Riot has reverted so many god damn nerfs that this has become so damned cringe worthy to be reading.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-03-01T22:36:16.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"you know what, I'm gonna try to get through this fast.\n\nlux's late game is actually balanced. not too strong, not too weak, and is good at what its supposed to be good at without being good at what id shouldn't be.\n\nmaking her early game weaker while not reducing her powerful midlate game is actuall the way to make balance good. lux shouldn't win early game, she should be surviving it.\n\nmaking her e have charge up time is a direct nerf in that it lowers her straight burst, and it lowers her lane presence considerably. having a longer cd to her ult lowers her up time. both are direct nerfs.\n\none point wonders are bad in kits that are already somewhat linear because it makes it more linear. linear kits are bad because linear kits are either playable and strong or unplayable and weak with no inbetween. lux's kit is pretty linear, with very little separating her out from the pack, and very little of it can be situational, but rather is just used in the same order all the time because there is almost never a good case to give to maxing things other than her slow first.\n\nalistar is already seperate enough from most other characters, and his kit relies on a combo of abilities, with good cases make able for maxing any one of his abilities first.\n\nI didn't say .75 root. I said 1 second root. into a root that's currently longer than the one on live.\n\nbeing able to farm or some safety is a choice she should have to make, rather than just getting both. decisions are what makes a game a game, if you don't need to make decisions than why even play. also, her q qould still give some safety, just not as much. enough to make it so that they will be able to escape from average ganks without flash, but low enough so they need to flash from strong engages.\n\nknifes edge because the current meta counters her and most of what champions like her do. any major change to her could change that, especially if its done poorly, which would cause repeated nerfs.\n\ndamage and how often it can be used correlate. cd's and scalings are both things to take into consideration, and I did when i suggested my better more fair version of the nerf that the op gave. lux's current damage patterns are consistant, fair to the enemy in most cases, and her damage is not up often enough to be unfair for players that are playing around her correctly.\nalso, the e ramp up time is a strait damage nerf, or it isn't anything. if the ramp is long enough to matter it could ruin lux's damage output considerably.\n\nlux is a champion that is somehwat defined by her ability to spam her ult, perhaps a change to it could be made, but what that is i do not know, because increasing the cd or cast time could break it and make it far less useful, therefore making it so that lux would need a good amount of power redistributed elsewhere, or she might just get replaced by xerath. the proper fix for this in hind sight could be to make it a true channel rather than a cast time, stil with the nerf that i had previously stated. it still lowers her safety.\n\nit does change its damage, you see, if it does less while ramping that likely means that her damage will suffer considerably, a similar problem to sion's current q. if its easily dodgable, it will be dodged. the ramp time would likely mean that lux would just end up with a weaker ability. I am not sure how you don't understand that.\n\nI wihs you were a closed book of complaints, then I wouldn't be reading any of this right now. I mean, jsut try to think about what these cahnges would do other than just \"nerf lux\" if lux is less reliable what happens to her? what if her stuff becomes more easy to dodge in this landscape of mobility everywhere, what does that do?\n\nI never insinuated that the op was correct in any way, heck man in the post I gave you I literally changed his main point. his point does however stand that lux should get nerfed, and probably in a similar manner to swain.\n\nyeah, actually, nuking on low cd's is fine. why? because killing squish is fair play, they are squish, if they can't dodge the skills they should definitely die. her damage isn't overbearing though, becuase fighters and tanks can almost ignore it so long as they dodge just the root. even with her low cd's and her high damage.\nalso, lux is one of the more mana hungry champions, so her ball does take a good while to actualyl get rolling in comparison to many of the more popular picks.\n\n2 seconds is too long. when your playing in the mobility lane, your damage is either instant or it didn't happen.\n\nlets compare. how many times has riot reverted a change, how many times has riot NOT reverted a change.\n\nwhich number is higher. Imma let you figure that one out.\n\n----\n\nJust so that we're specific here, so that people that do not want to read our long ass list of points and counter points, and so I can clarify exactly what we are arguing, let me state what our changes of choice are, and what htey are meant to entail.\n\nI want lux to get nerfed by having her q's duration changed from 2 seconds flat to 1-1.5-1.75-2-2.25 and her ult to change from being a cast time that can not be canceled to a channel that can be.\n\nThe idea of my changes is to reduce lux's early game safety, while not hurting her damage or late game reliability.\n\nSilent wants lux to be nerfed by having lux's e changed from flat damage throughout the skill to having damage that charges over 2 seconds during the skill, and increasing her ultimates cooldown to an unspecified amount.\n\nThe idea of their changes is to make lux more difficult to play, while not increasing any of her other stats or abilities to help her get over the increase of difficulty.\n\nactually if you wouldn't mind can you stick to this last thing in your next post silent, I feel like we'll end up writing a novel for every post if we keep what we're doing up.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kaxi","date":"2016-03-01T17:12:11.322+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I actually wouldn't mind this sort of nerf (being a Lux player), so long as there's a trade-off.
