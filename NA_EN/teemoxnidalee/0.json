Best argument so far is to simply have the backdoor bonus on turrets make them immune to true damage entirely, though that&#x27;s not a guaranteed approach yet.\n\nEasiest solution: remove \"true damage\" from red buff and mountain dragon (against turrets only) and rework them to do bonus physical or magical damage based on your higher stat (AD or AP), and buff the numbers a bit so they do the same damage that they did when it was true damage. It would be similar to the old dragon that did magic damage instead of true damage to turrets. The only reason you'd need to code it to do physical OR magical (based on your stats) would be because penetration against turrets is a thing now.\n\n.....Or just leave it alone, and let \"true damage\" be reduced against turrets with the backdoor bonus in effect. From a \"clarity\" standpoint it's fine, really. We're lucky we can even do true damage AT ALL to turrets. It never used to be a thing. Before Krugz existed, it wasn't a thing at all. Ever. If the \"clarity\" of it is really bothering you, then add a tooltip to the turrets when you highlight them with no minions around. If a tooltip isn't enough (since most experienced players disable \"new player tooltips\"), then add an actual text that appears above the turret (similar to how text appears when minions get killed and give you gold, or how text appears when you do damage to things, etc), and make it say in BIG BRIGHT RED LETTERS each time you autoattack the turret: **_\"BACKDOOR BONUS IN EFFECT: ALL DAMAGE REDUCED, INCLUDING TRUE DAMAGE\"_**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Critkeeper","date":"2016-05-20T01:20:25.920+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about just giving turrets a 500 point shield when no minions are nearby that refreshes on taking damage.\n\nIf what you wanted to do was making it difficult rather than plain impossible to take a tower with no minions nearby, reduce the shield from 500 to 100.\n\nHonestly, turrets shouldn't even have backdoor armor or backdoor damage reduction in the first place because it specifically diminishes non-true damage, and clearly that isn't what you want.\n\nIf you change it all to a shield, and then find that magic and physical damage dealers cannot back door at all, but you want them to be able to, then have the turret's backdoor-shield's maximum health permanently diminish by 5% of the physical and magic damage it blocks every time it blocks damage.\n\nThis rewards repetitive and unrelenting backdooring against a single turret, which is fair because it is gives the enemy team plenty of time to react. It amortizes the value of having true damage to be appoximately the same as not having true damage, since most of the time spent backdooring is spent making multiple trips against the tower to whittle the shield's blocking power, which doesn't care about your true damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2016-05-20T03:49:56.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about a buff that exists only while the Backdoor Buff is active. \"This structure rapidly heals all true damage dealt to it\".\n\nThen it gets gray health from true damage which heals at 20% per second.
