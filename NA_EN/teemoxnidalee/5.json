Apparently you've never tried to play riven, because she does indeed take skill to be good with. her auto-move-q takes quite some practice to actually accomplish. You can't just spam buttons as riven and win, you have to know what you're doing and when to do it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"colesy","date":"2015-08-06T17:09:04.884+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"bronzes need to be banned from posting","replies":[]}]}
