But since they also removed the MS buff on Nomad's, the Talisman route has been far less appealing. Maybe copy the build I've defaulted to with Lulu/Karma. It should work.\n\nNot really sure why I don't play Lux as much as I used to. I personally feel her \"All Damage\" refreshing shield is more valuable than Morgana's CC immune shield. Lux + Ardent Censor is a good team shield for seizing objectives and team fights. And while Lux may have a shorter duration snare, it does pass through minions if you know your angles. Her skills aren't as quirky as Lulu's (annoys me to no end when I try to shield an ally and Pixie mark the enemy instead because I tried to click, instead of using portrait) and her poke isn't stopped by minions like Karma's.\n\nI guess the real reason is that I hit level 5 Mastery with her a long time ago and have spent most of the past months leveling other supports.
