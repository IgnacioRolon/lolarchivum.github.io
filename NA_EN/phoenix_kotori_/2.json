It&#039;s really easy to test and see that the regeneration sigils have been removed just kill any camp and you'll see the previous restore effect is gone. \n\nThough the crab still has the buff, it will not grant the restore when you kill it. \n\nIn other words they gimped the natural health levels of the jungle in order force junglers into building {{item:2032}} for similar effects.\n\nAlthough since it wasn&#039;t documented in the patch notes it could have been an unintentional change, but the removal of regeneration sigils definitely making clears worse regardless whether it was an accident not meant to go live, or if they just forgot to mention in the patch notes.","replies":[]}
