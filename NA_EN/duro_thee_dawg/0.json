I know how frustrating it is when you are penalized but don't believe it was warranted.\r\nI definitely don't want you to feel singled out here! Any time a player breaks our behavioral guidelines and it is brought to our attention we penalize for it, which means we really are just holding you to the same standards as the rest of the community.\r\nBut, I will go ahead and look into the other players involved for ya and will take action on their accounts based on my findings.\r\nRemember, that both initiating and retaliating with negative chat both break our behavioral guidelines. This means that negative behavior is unacceptable regardless of the circumstances or who started it. Really the best thing to do when players are frustrating you is to ignore them, mute them in order to focus on your own gameplay, and then report them after the game so the IFS looks into their behavior. When we engage in negativity with other players who are flaming and trolling us we just add negativity to our games and make the situations worse.\r\nShifting the focus back to your penalty - I do see that you insulted other players, criticized them for their performance, argued with them, and taunted them. This behavior did add negativity to your game and your account was penalized to draw attention to that. I definitely get how much it sucks being suspended for non-extreme negativity in chat, and where normally this type of behavior would lead to a chat restriction, since you had a recent 25-game chat restriction before this the next step in penalty escalation is a 2-week suspension, and unfortunately I won't be able to lift it. If you would like to read up on behavioral escalation you can check out this link here\r\nI genuinely don't want you to be penalized further in the future! So I would like to give you a clear warning - a two week suspension is the last step in penalty escalation. Any further instances of negativity will result in a permanent suspension. The most important piece of advice I can give is to use chat sparingly only to strategize with your team and hyper-focus on communicating with your team through pings. This way if you are tempted to use negative chat, you alleviate the possibility of a permanent suspension.\r\nHowever, like I mentioned before, we are investigating the other players involved for you, so if you have any info for me that you think I may find helpful for my investigation please feel free to send it my way.\r\nI understand this isn't the outcome that you wanted, and where we won't be able to lift your suspension prematurely, it is set to lift on Mon Sep 16, 2019 - 5:46PM Pacific Time.\r\nIf you have any new questions for me or would like help with a different issue please let me know!\r\nRedEdge\r\nRiot Games Player Support\r\n\"We will prevail on the fields of justice!\"\r\n\r\nThis is wrong and the real problem is that they feel no guilt for the system being abused. I'm sure you could join a game right now where atleast one player is much more toxic, and they will not be banned unless the system is abused by toxic players themselves. Riot just needs to stop banning people until they figure out an accurate way that doesn't involve terrible judgement of employees that go to work \"and do their job\" like any other disgruntled person in the world.\r\n\r\nTo avoid confusion: Yes I was banned from 1 game and this is the entire chat log. I'm not hiding anything. I did not edit the chat. This is 100% the reason I was banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-09-21T20:09:10.876+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is the log from the support ticket then?

In reality, it is possible for some punishable behavior to go unpunished. First, punishments in LoL can only occur after a valid report. Second, punishments take into account the consistency and severity of the punished player's misbehavior: if two players in a match break the same rule in the same way, one who consistently misbehaves in this way might get a punishment while the other who almost never does so gets away without a punishment (this time). At the end of the day, though, all this does is explain how differences in player behavior over many games can produce different results for equivalent behavior within a single game. It doesn't excuse poor behavior. One person having a rare bad day doesn't give a consistently toxic player the right to join in. The only behavior that matters in your punishment is your own... and a good thing, too: how would you feel if you behaved yourself but got punished anyway just because all your teammates were spectacularly friendly, communicative, and positive?\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025054153-Understanding-Your-Temporary-Account-Ban):\n\n> We can not discuss other playersâ€™ actions with you but you can always report them at end of game and mute them when in game.

They did exactly this. The current system, called the Instant Feedback System, or IFS, is automated software that uses machine learning to determine what behavior should be punishable and when a player's behavior should be punished. It started with data from the Tribunal, and has been learning and adapting for years. It operates on the same basic principles as a spam filter: get a corpus of data (emails/chat logs), have humans categorize each item as acceptable or unacceptable, find patterns within each category, and then finally look for those patterns to automatically categorize new items without direct human evaluation. Each report is like clicking the \"spam\" button. When a new pattern starts to get lots of reports, the IFS recognizes it as a new form of toxicity. Rioters only get involved when an account is up for a permaban, or when a player contacts support.","replies":[{"poster":"Duro Thee Dawg","date":"2019-09-21T22:07:47.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-09-21T22:11:14.289+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Duro Thee Dawg,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=OU6Hu39Y,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-09-21T22:07:47.004+0000)\n>\n> If you're wondering what an emotionally scarred forum troll looks like, then here it is.
