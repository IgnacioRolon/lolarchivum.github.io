Almost every game there are mostly extremely toxic players which I did NOT expect that in my life. They&#039;re giving death threat, harassment, nasty attitude like mentally retarded and so on and on. I seriously DID NOT expect that to happen to be utterly disgusting and I have to report them...so many of them since they were being immensely toxic. It really BLEW MY MIND, I thought this is the beginner level for new players to play and learn before ranked or just play for fun, but no instead they&#039;re taking is very seriously. That&#039;s scary, man.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-06-16T07:15:47.781+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your account was probably quickly flagged as a smurf because you are much more skilled than a new player. That means you will mostly play with other smurfs. Most of the smurfs are new accounts of players that were banned for toxicity.","replies":[{"poster":"MasterAkua","date":"2017-06-16T07:42:03.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh wow, I did not know that.

Low level games are pretty crazy. Everyone's smurfing and then there's the occasional innocent newb getting berated.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KORGtuners","date":"2017-06-16T19:43:39.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too many bots.","replies":[]}]}
