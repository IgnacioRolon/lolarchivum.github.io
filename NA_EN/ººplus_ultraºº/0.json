My MS (only in game, everything else was running fine) spiked to 500. My game got stuck \"Attempting to reconnect\" so I closed it to try and reconnect. However, when I closed it the client wouldn't give me the option to reconnect, instead I could queue up for a new game. Problem being, the match is not in my match history and [OP.GG ](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=l%20%20%C2%BA%20%20v%20%20%C2%BA%20%20l)says that I am currently in game. Please help, I just came off a leave buster punishment and I'd hate to get stuck in another one so soon :\\","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-05-14T04:31:31.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spooky! It sounds sorta like you encountered a Ghost Game here. There was probably a server hiccup that caused the game to drop and not be recorded. In essence, it 'never happened', so you won't actually be affected by the drop and you won't receive Leaver Buster for it either. :)\n\nIf you keep getting more of these, feel free to hit up our Tech Team in a [**ticket **](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)and let them know.
