Trying to play with friends new to this game. \n\nYou can pretend they'll fix the game based off mmr all you want, but then they just int troll and feed, also a system abused relentlessly, because it's only worthwhile rebuking the vocal players. This game is just trying to kill itself off now so they can start a new one.\n\nEdit: this is why you're able to have multiple accounts linked to one email. They genuinely adore it when you make another one. Smurf, alt, reroll account, w/e you want to call it. They love that you've made a new account to potentially buy something, or to inflate the numbers of players \"coming in\" to the game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Moonscourge","date":"2018-10-20T14:22:32.466+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Smurfs mostly play against other smurfs, so if you're smurfing you don't get an accurate picture","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dr Dog","date":"2018-10-21T00:11:38.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its simple, dont play with them at lower levels, if your duoing with them or even on a different account YOUR the one getting them put with smurfs","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vreivai","date":"2018-10-21T00:04:31.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because there's no reasonable way for them to determine beyond doubt that an account is a smurf.\n\nAnd on top of that, there may be reasons for having a smurf that are reasonable. For example, I'm currently considering making one not to go beat up on lower ranked people, but because I used to have MMR in the range of high silver to low gold, but my ability to play this game has atrophied to the point where I'd guess I'm now mid-bronze. And yet, no matter how long I sustain a win rate well below 50%, my MMR does not budge one bit. So I'd be making a smurf so I'm able to actually play with people near my skill level.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silly Neeko","date":"2018-10-20T10:37:42.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are pros and cons to smurfs.

That OR there is the key thing. A bronze still has higher level than a level 10. Often meaning they are more experienced than other level 10s. That does not mean they are good, or that only diamonds have smurfs. It just means that they have a higher leveled and ranked account that is still able to be played, and the smurf is the lower one.\n\nThus, a bronze player can have a smurf, and still be ending up in bronze eventually.","replies":[{"poster":"Constantiine","date":"2018-10-20T21:16:48.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"-__- it meas a non garbage player is playing with garbage people. aka a if your main is bronze your not a smurph. if your mains silver your not a smurph. if your mains gold and your playing on a bronze account your a smurph. if your on your main and vs lvl 10 your just playing against new people on your main.","replies":[{"poster":"Silly Neeko","date":"2018-10-20T21:44:08.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001259787-Smurfing\n\nUnless it is in CLASH which they stated clearly, then the definition is \"a second account\".\n\nAnd it is smurf, not smurph. So please, feel free to settle down already. I know you are trying to argue for smurfing but if you actually read or understood anything that was said you would realize just how silly it is that you are trying to argue about the definition of a smurf, which the one i clearly explained is the generalized and accepted definition of a smurf to pretty much everyone except yourself and a few other posts able to be found on google that state that only higher skilled people have smurfs....\n\nGot news for you. Even a bronze is higher skilled than a level 10 who just started the game 90% of the time.
