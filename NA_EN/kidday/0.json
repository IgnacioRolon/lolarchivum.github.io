Not necessarily sure, but when you unlock all 3 of the icons for 750ip, are you supposed to receive 7 PROJECT Cores in total as well to be able to obtain/acquire an icon blueprint to be permanent?

You'll be able to unlock a total of 10 through the icon chests once the upcoming disruption cache becomes available.  Additional cores can be found through augment caches.
