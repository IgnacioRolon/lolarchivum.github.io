You'll realize then Teemo planted a mushroom there. You'll panic and move yoru cursor away, only to see it again. BLAM! \n\nSuddenly your computer is lagging, you have no idea why you did that. You start twitching the mouse trying to regain control, but then it's too late. That last poof lifts, and you're forced to watch in horror as your computer crashes, only to give you that all too familiar \"YOU HAVE BEEN SLAIN!\" Announcement, followed by an icon of your computer being slain by Teemo.\n\nI hope you're proud of yourself.
