The game will randomly work one day and not the next day. I can even test the game out to see if it's working in a custom game (which is a pia to do) and it will work then I try an actual game and it doesn't work. I've sent a ticket and they told me to turn off windows game mode (which I did) and it worked for a little while after that so I thought it was fixed. Couple days later problem comes back, I go to check if it got turned back on and it didn't. What am I supposed to do now... This has been multiple weeks now... has the problem really not been found???","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-25T16:14:13.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Constantly getting this error and resulting in a [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) sounds pretty stressful, and I don't recommend playing anymore matchmade games until this is fixed up.
