In my last game I got reported for &quot;inting&quot; when I clearly said I was intentionally killing myself and it was just a bad game.  I was 1/16 and I know its a horrible score, but I NEVER in league of legends go that nasty score.  One game I play this type of Sion and BOOM, instantly banned.  Riot Maple said in a Reddit post that this type of ban wasn&#039;t going to be punished because its sort of a game strategy of some sort that we don&#039;t have enough info about.  Here is the link: https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/9lmg47/inting_sion_is_doing_more_harm_than_good/e790zkq/\r\n\r\nI lost my Honor Level so I wont get my rewards for playing bad ONE GAME.  Does that mean that League of Legends has a specific K/D ratio to get banned?  If I go 1/16 for any reason, will I get banned?  How can I get help in this situation?  Thanks in advance.","replies":[]}
