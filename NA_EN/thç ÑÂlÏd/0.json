Normal navigation, downloads, streaming, ALL the other games I have installed... So the problem comes from lol after the patch.\n\nAnd if I have to be accurate, I remember a live small update that I notice in the let upper icon (when the patch is downloading in blue) and after that my lol gets some probles like this \"attempting to reconnect\" and FPS \"absurds\" and nonsense drops time by time (maybe 3 of them in the same game, then noone in the next game, 5 in the next and so..)\n\nSo definitely and with all the people having the same problems its obvious we can say that the these problems comes after some league of legends patch/fix.","replies":[]}]}]}
