Ahah But something that embodies her active anger might be really cool, instead of the bitter, depressing songs she actually has. Or perhaps just something nice and peaceful, reminiscent of her Lunar Goddess skin?\n\nOn the contrary, maybe Leona? She's a ray of sunshine, a beacon of hope, so full of compassion, and has the desire and capability of protecting others. It'd be a nice optimistic song. :) (unlessyouwannaplayonthewholedeadsolarithing)\n\nBesides that, what about something that relates to the sheer magnitude of Syndra's power? Maybe something that could feel like how it felt to have power flowing through you and how it felt to rip a whole building out of the ground.\n\nI also wonder what a theme for Shyvana might sound like. You could possibly try to convey the struggle she likely has with her rage and even nod at the loneliness she feels from having been rejected by both of her heritages. But then I feel like that might sound similar to my Diana suggestion. Hm. Well, at the very least, I would hope these could inspire you, even if only for other things. I hope this doesn't sound too silly, either...","replies":[{"poster":"i am peel","date":"2015-10-22T10:52:59.968+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've already been thinking a lot on Diana and Leona before i posted this, it would be an interesting dynamic to work with. I'd probably use mostly strings for the Leona and Diana's theme (maybe some piano like from my Kindred track sprinkled in there).\n\nSyndra i could see using a lot of low brass and woodwinds with accentuating strings in the background It would probably be super dark sounding but also just massive.\n\nand Shyvanna is one of my favorite champions personally, (she was my go top laner before the meta shifted) I would think that her theme would be full of majesty and pride, while also tinged with that lonliness. Im thinking melodies in mid Brass (trombones, French Horns) but with strings to back it up in the higher register.\n\nI appreciate the suggestions :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hotlin3 Fling","date":"2015-10-22T01:42:26.657+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Singed","replies":[]},{"poster":"TwinkiePro","date":"2015-10-22T00:45:10.966+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If only you could do a poll with EVERY SINGLE CHAMPION, but that would take a while.
