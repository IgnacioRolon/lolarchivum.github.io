I had it set to borderless mode before and it&#039;s worked for years and if I set it to borderless again it just changes back to windowed the next game. How do I fix this?\n\nThis issue also seems to be exclusive to the updated client. I have no problems starting on borderless on the legacy client.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-18T18:52:51.654+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your settings aren't saving, which can happen if your config has become corrupt.  Try performing a config reset to fix this up.\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings. \n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"TADED","date":"2017-11-29T23:01:33.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!
