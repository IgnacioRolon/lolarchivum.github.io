If your god-tier at any of the 5 champs then you can def make it work, but by an large most people are not.

I know you don't mean ill :3\n\n* A Short Fuse build is very easy to maintain a high DPS with: you just have to basic attack, Q, attack, W, etc. It's pretty safe thanks to Distributor (850 range), plus your W and E allowing a little room for riskier plays since they can let you escape a rather serious situation were you to run out of Warps.\n* It doesn't deal a lot of AoE damage (not as much as Jinx' AP build), but the damage on 5 targets (thanks to Bounce) is high enough that you can effectively wipe a large area clear of these eggs that spawn Malzahar's minions, all on your own.\n* The Shorter augment makes your Short fuse cool down in 2s, and with 40% CDR, you have a 2.4s CD on your Q. You can effectively roll out something like attack > Q > attack every 2.4s, with a downtime of a little less than 2s which you can use to reposition. Just like Jhin, sort of.\n* Buying stuff like Nashor's tooth or Guinsoo's rageblade lets you deal some damage still if the monsters aren't targeting you or you just wrecked the closest ones. The added attack speed also makes it easier to use your quick combo and GTHO before you're caught by an alien scorpion.\n\nIt's a metric ton of fun because it feels so off to deal so much more damage with basic attacks than with an ultimate. Like, how is that even possible?\n***\nAnd to really prove that weird picks can make it to beat Onslaught: yesterday evening (night) I was in a full party, and we were trying to beat Kayn with a team of Yasuo, to no avail. So at some point I went \"people, let's play AP Jinx because it's fun\".\nNone of my four teammates seemingly had ever tried it in this mode.\n\nThe results:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/zJaTtoE.png\n\nAugments were (mostly, not all of them had enough slots): Bamboozle, Hoppers, Arsenal, Comet, Plan:A. 2nd player changed item builds partway because they thought our damage wouldn't be high enough (finished it with Essence reaver, Spear of Shojin, Zeal; didn't do much with these augments), 5th seemingly didn't possess the Plan:A augment, which was a big part of the damage.\nAs for items: {{item:3020}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3148}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3089}} {{item:1031}}. Guinsoo's proved rather meh, because I didn't have enough AS for it to have any effect (next time I'll pick a Rod of Ages).\nI don't like augmenting my Zapper (W), because it feels pretty underwhelming, in so far that it doesn't disable monsters (Kog'Maw / Xerath like monsters keep shooting), doesn't scale with AP and costs boatloads of mana. Maybe in a juggernaut build of sorts?\nAlso, stacking an Archangel's staff is very slow, because you don't have anything you can (nor should) truly spam. I advise against it, and for the management of your mana instead.\n\n* Try and always keep a Comet on you, in case a massive patch of very angry aliens appears. Said Comet has a 19s charge CD, down to 12s with 40% CDR, but I didn't feel the need of it since I carefully managed my charges.\n* You'll kill anything stationary (Vel'Koz birdies of sorts, for example) with just one Comet thanks to Liandry's and Plan:A.\n* Drop your E whenever it might hit stuff, the Hoppers + Bamboozle augments will decrease its cooldown time drastically. If you manage to hold off a big pack of rather slow things thanks to repeated use of your Chompers, you can then shoot a Comet into them and see them burn to death. Also, the large number of Chompers and the rather low cooldown of the spell makes it so that scorpions etc. rarely get to you.\n* Always keep a look at your minimap: sometimes you will see a mega-pack of aliens bundled in a long corridor. At which point you just have to run a few steps and press R to disintegrate them all.\n* The absurd AoE DPS makes you heal extremely fast, so don't worry if you take a few hits. As long as you aren't dead, you can shoot a Comet into an angry mob and recover.\n* You can begin casting any skill, then Warp (Odyssey Flash) immediately: the spell will shoot where you began casting it from, in the direction you wanted, but you'll have teleported far away in the meantime. It basically lets you get a very risky line of fire, and get away with it unscathed.\n* If you happen upon a map with lots of these weird things that stick out their tongues to grab you, Nautilus-style: don't panic! Hide behind terrain, and ensnare them when they risk getting a clear shot. Their movement capabilities should make them stick close to one another, and by then it's a free Comet apocalypse.\n* It's a motherloving mayhem when all five players shoot stuff in all directions.\n***\nAlso: I appreciate being called a goddess from time to time. Or god-tier, however you name it really.
