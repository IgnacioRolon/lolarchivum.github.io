I didn't seriously consider acting on my interest in art until I was at the end of my Psych degree (I was about 24) but I don't think it's ever too late. It's really difficult, and it's an endless path of progression, but if you have a passion for it the only obstacles in your way is time and effort.","replies":[{"poster":"RuPaul","date":"2018-01-10T13:02:09.966+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow a rioter actually replied! ^o^\nI had given up and didn't notice since I use reddit and barely check boards.

PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE\nYou may watch all the tutorials you can and understand them thoroughly, but in order to make real progress, you have to put whatever you learn (or want to learn!) or otherwise into practice! That's really the best way to get better.\n\n-_-\n\n#2. GET INSPIRED\nLiterally everything around you is inspiration if you just look hard enough- The patterns on the fallen leaves on the way to your school, your mom's face when she yells at you out of care and possibly discipline, your main champion and SO MUCH MORE! INFINITELY MORE!\n\n-_-\n\n#3. FEEDBACK\n\nThis could be a tough one, because this is such an important thing that many people struggle with. Just remember-[ YOU SUCK, but it DOESN'T MATTER!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6akbJMemGM) :D\nOther times you're gonna get sucked into that fan champion concept you're making. You're gonna love it and yourself so much. Too much perhaps. And that's great! It is! BUT, getting the objective advice and point of view of others is often crucial for your designs' success- It gives you that fresh new perspective you never knew you needed and solidifies the direction of your piece further! Imagine your hateful neighbor next door grabbing mail and suddenly telling you, _\"No, this ain't very Ionian of that champ like you wish it was. Here, try this instead maybe\",_ and you go _\"HOLY SHIT how haven't_ I _thought of that! THIS IS GENIUS. LITERALLY MY SAVIOR\"_\n...Or something along these lines.\nPoint is, don't be afraid to do this because in the many varied cases FEEDBACK is gonna save your life!\n\n-_-\n\nAs recommended just a paragraph ago, I highly recommend again watching the amazing Kienan Laffery in action:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/KienanLafferty\n\nHe was previously a splash artist and concept artist at Riot and now works on the upcoming brawl game Icons.\n\n-_-\n\nGood luck in your amazing journey! I think you may have already guessed, but I can promise you that it's endless fun!","replies":[{"poster":"RuPaul","date":"2018-01-02T02:09:14.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for this great advice :D will definitely do everything you said","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JarPoop IV","date":"2018-01-01T14:10:27.428+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Practice for art takes some serious hours n commitment.
