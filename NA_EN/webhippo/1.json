From my experience people tend to forget good experiences quickly and remember negative experiences for a long time.  If you think you're having bad experiences in League then try the following exercise:\n\nPlay 20 games and record your experience on a notepad for each one.  Say nothing that isn't integral to the game itself.  IE report on enemy summoners, grouping up, or strategy, but try not to tell your bot lane how poorly they're doing.  How many people were nice? How many people were rude? How many people said nothing?  Did you get honored? Did you feel a need to report someone?  You may be surprised at the results.","replies":[{"poster":"webhippo","date":"2014-11-03T22:12:36.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually try to be very nice in game.

NOT\n\nLol ;) jk\nBut yeah, it's amazing how stress free this game can be if you just approach it the right way.

Did some ranked 5's with friends just for ward skin(players ranging from bronze to plat). I main riven and am gold, but we were facing silver to gold players.\n\nGot ganked by amumu  against ryze top as riven. Said man nice gank but i really hate how amumus bandages snap to a wider hitbox.\n\nINSTANTLY met with \"madcuzbad, salt comments etc\". Not even 2 minutes after that i started outplaying their ryze and getting doubles etc. We ended up destroying their team but were cool about it. We didnt trash talk back, and they never said another word. I don't get why people can't just be cool in games.

To be honest, though, I think the reason more people in ranked are toxic is because of the 2/15 troll that doesn't care about winning, while the others in ranked do.
