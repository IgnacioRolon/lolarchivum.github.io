It was a little bumpy getting used to it at first, but it has really grown on me. I've noticed that each patch refines it more and I was wondering if you have any plans on mirroring the champion info on the Tab screen. \r\nRight now in spectator mode the champion information is mirrored and it makes comparing information between champions really easy at a glance. I was hoping that that would be applied to the Tab screen in game because it would be consistent with other parts of the game (spectator mode) and improve readability at a glance. \r\nI included images of the currect Tab screen as well as the upcoming spectator mode update just as reference.\r\nThank you for all of your hard work! \r\n\r\nTo the community: What are your thoughts on having the Tab screen mirrored? Feel free to comment and vote in the poll.","replies":[{"poster":"CrabDust","date":"2015-09-11T18:28:39.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey hippo, sorry for the late response.
