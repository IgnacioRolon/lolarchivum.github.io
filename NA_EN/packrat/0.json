Getting an error this early might be indicating a security setting with your OS, antivirus, or something else that's blocking your game files from being read.  Meaning the patcher can't locate your game files and prepare them to update.\n\nYour best bet here is to go over each step of the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure League is added as an exception and cleared of any blocks.
