It's not that bad now that I know I can disconnect and reconnect but it's still annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-09T18:12:34.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From your description, it sounds like there are issues with your local network that are causing this.
