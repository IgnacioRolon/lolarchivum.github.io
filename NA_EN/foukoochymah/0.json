I got mid (one of my two requested roles) but didn&#039;t feel really confident in my abilities to carry the game from the mid-lane and the person who got support instantly asked for mid when the champion selection started so I traded with him.\nI&#039;m not a good support (top main) and much less a good Lulu (Darius main, yeah, sorry) but I did what I could in this game where their botlane was much better than I am.  My ADC was really worked up about the game from the beginning and was really aggressive in her statement accusing me of trolling when I was just really not able to do anything since I was under-leveled and the rest of the team wasn&#039;t doing great.\nCaitlyn (our ADC) was very negative throughout the game and was very toxic to the rest of the team but I personally didn&#039;t mind since I wasn&#039;t exactly doing a good job as a support. I just considered that she must have had a hard day in soloQ and when the game ended I left the lobby without reporting her.\n\nBut that&#039;s where things get iffy. Caitlyn added me after the game, I thought &quot;why not, he/she must have had complaints about my job as a support and maybe I&#039;ll learn something out of it&quot;. \nWell, as most of you already expect, that&#039;s not exactly the reason she added me after the game. She then proceeded to insult me with an amazing originality, sometimes chanting voodoo spells, all of it in a very unexpected _ALL CAPS_  style that we all know so well from our many short tempered friends playing the game. \n\nIn the end, he/she spent the next 20 minutes insulting me, my family, my _SOCIAL BACKGROUND   _   (;__;), etc, ect.\n\nUsually, I don&#039;t mind people being rude to me. I play badly from times to times and I believe its important to tell someone when they do something bad. But once the game ends, does it really matter anymore who did really bad during the game ? I learned my lesson and will reflect on my actions, next time I won&#039;t play a champion I can&#039;t play very well. But the verbal abuse after the game ends, I quote :\n> 14:30\nI\nTOLD\nU\nWASNT\nABOUT\nGAME\n\nI really regret not reporting him after the game. I have great patience but one can only insult someone else&#039;s family for so long.\n\nSeeing that there is no way to report someone for unsportsmanlike behavior after the game ends I came to write this post. \nI&#039;m not asking for him to be banned because as you might notice, I was playing along with him in these messages so you might consider me part-responsible for his attitude, but adding a feature to report unsportsmanlike behavior after the game ends and everyone leaves the lobby could definitely see some use in cases like this.\n\nHere are some screenshots from the &quot;conversation&quot;. I don&#039;t really know how to send the whole thing without being able to modify its content (I could copy paste it in word but then some might argue that I made some of it up).\n\n[start of the conversation](https://gyazo.com/3e40f984c0862eff59c8900bcac9f4d9)\n[&quot;blah blah, kys, blah blah&quot;](https://gyazo.com/a8748dc8554d4fdd984017226ad9b6a0)\n[voodoo chants](https://gyazo.com/a82b1387c48f3073c7c44485edfe552e)\n[something about his ties with my monkey family](https://gyazo.com/f119fb333bad6112102bcab54d341326)\n[me playing along with him](https://gyazo.com/30a9c591e5ab9fc4964a28895a0bd038)\n[more voodoo](https://gyazo.com/63abb24f7b19650dccd228b75b4ee098)\n[my favorite (and more voodoo chants)](https://gyazo.com/412fbe305a9db9ce6afa3b45e58ee75f)        &quot;stop wasting people&#039;s time&quot;\n[***FouKoOchYmaH** used **reason** it&#039;s not very effective*](https://gyazo.com/093f20214e3ad0d51904a8811166d576)\n\nI can send you more of it if you want to but I think I&#039;ve made my point.","replies":[{"poster":"Ireliavence","date":"2017-06-21T08:13:55.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol that was actual Voodoo prayer.\n\nShe tried to fucking curse your future relationships over the internet\n\nHoly shit that's next level salt, she went to satan for that flame","replies":[]},{"poster":"Captain Nem√∏","date":"2017-06-21T08:06:34.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, as the Cait was also negative and toxic in game, there is a high chance your teammates reported her, and maybe even the enemy team. Even if I don't know what happened in my ennemy's chat, if I see flame or toxic behavior in end game chat, I always report people (the game is over, stop harassing people, just play another or go chill a little !). Seeing how Cait reacted, the intensity of her toxicity, it's obvious she often act like that, leashing out at teammates when frustrated and adding them after without a second of hesitation to continue the flame thingy. I'm pretty sure she will be banned soon if she can't stop acting like that, even without your report (But reporting her to the player support will get her punished more quickly by Riot). But what she's saying is really funny and ridiculous, thanks for sharing it !","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-06-20T15:57:47.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can submit a report through the player support by writing up a ticket under \"general questions\".
