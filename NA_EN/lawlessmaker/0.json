My computer decided it was time to update, nothing I could do as it didn't give me option to stop it or push it back to later time.\r\n\r\nHowever, that's not my what I want to talk about.. It fucking gave me leavebuster... The only other time I remember leaving a game is cause of ^ that reason up there, which was at the beginning of the month and 26 games apart and 13 days apart.. So how does it count it? Does it count it as the fact it was two times in a month or do they stack for a period of time? Either way, it's stupid... I went 26 games without problem of leaving, that should count for something..\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, I LOST LP!!!! But the team won... We were dominating lane before the update booted me, and the chat was quiet.. I'm not saying I should get some of that win LP cause the team won without me but I sure as hell shouldn't fucking lose any.. Especially 20!

Since missing just a few minutes of the match can have a very big impact on the outcome of the match, we do have to take ranked matches a little more seriously. You did lose that LP because the match was flagged as a loss since you weren't in the match the whole game.\n\nAlso, the system ended up giving you a [**leaverbuster **](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ#h1q3) after multiple left games. It does take past leaves into account, and afk ranked matches are always taken more seriously.","replies":[]}]}
