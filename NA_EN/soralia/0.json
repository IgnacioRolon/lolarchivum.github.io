It began around last week. Not like usually I have 60 FPS but today I have 30, the drops randomly occur. At the start of a match, it's at its normal level; 40-60 FPS. Mid-game and late-game is when this begins to happen, and the drops may go from 60 to &lt;10. After a short while, the FPS goes back up. In most matches, I ask if anyone else has this issue. Many players also complain of this issue in /all chat, meaning there is more than just 1 person out there with this issue.\r\n\r\nI am running on a MacBook Air. I know, it's not really a computer suited for gaming, but I'm just a student who plays for fun. I'm not sure what the other players I've asked are running on. \r\n\r\nServer? NA.","replies":[{"poster":"Roostter","date":"2017-03-09T22:04:31.836+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"same problem and i already changed all the specs to very low and the resolution to HD when my computer allows FHD but it continues to do the same particularly when in fight.\nIs really frustrating and it's getting harder to play LoL\nI have an i7 Processor with a dedicated 2GB nvidia and 12Gb RAM","replies":[]},{"poster":"hanai02","date":"2017-03-29T18:33:39.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what happen with the game?

You should run through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to fix that up and get back in game and resolve any instability that would be causing you in-game delays.
