Since you're getting disconnected and a few bugsplats as well, let's be sure to tackle those each individually. \n\nFor those disconnects, make sure to check up on your network settings using this [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). There may be some oddly configured settings somewhere that are giving your connection a hard time.\n\nBugsplats typically happen when some of the game files become corrupted or damaged. Most of them time a simple repair through the client can help, but if it doesn't go ahead and grab our [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and run a repair with it as well.","replies":[]}]}
