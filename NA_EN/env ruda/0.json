You think that it’s a coincidence that Lucian, one of the most op adc at the moment, gets a legendary skin? or like all of the kda skinline was popular champs, it’s pretty sad though, being an asol main I feel ur pain of having an overlooked champ in terms of skins, although I got mecha, it was disappointing after such a long wait and the excitement of hearing of a new skin in early 2018.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Highest Noon","date":"2019-01-07T00:09:21.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If a champion is played in the lower percentile, a new skin isn't gonna change that.

But it also the fact that sol {{champion:136}} wont get any love cause they just dont pay attention to him at alll if they did they would allowed his stun to to stop inside his innercircle instead of out but yeah either way  KFCev understands","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-01-06T12:24:52.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot creates products and services that they think people are more likely to buy, like every other business.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Asamas","date":"2019-01-05T19:12:44.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where were you when I made that \"Ivern players gather\" post?
