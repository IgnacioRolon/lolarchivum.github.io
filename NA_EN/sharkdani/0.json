Ok I know is God for end game but really the end game he look even useless if it coming. Another reason is because is beautiful champion to see but the immobility to play it is impossible to play need something.","replies":[{"poster":"The Old Cthulhu","date":"2019-06-10T00:14:27.358+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Obviously english isn't your first language, but I agree.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-06-10T01:47:20.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The last thing he needs is a buff, he is terrifying in skilled hands. \n\nWhat he has is one of the highest skill requirements in the game, and a rework wont change that without completely changing his kit and removing all his core mechanics. Not ever champ needs to be master yi.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosReyn","date":"2019-06-10T22:49:21.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's true he's just as terrifyingly out of meta at the moment as well though. I wouldn't say he needs a rework...but couldn't they give him something minor for the early-to-mid game? Maybe up the speed his stars passively rotate by his CDR or something?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EATARI","date":"2019-06-09T23:36:07.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree?","replies":[]}]}
