Like an extra tenacity or ms buff that would be lost upon getting a kill/tower/large amount of assists?\r\n\r\nAsking for a friend, i never do poorly.{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}}","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-09-10T22:21:15.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"rewarded for falling behind...... hmmmm i dont think that will ever be a thing unless you consider bounty gold the only thing.","replies":[]}]}
