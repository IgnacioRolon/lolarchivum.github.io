Digital Ram acknowledged your issue and he understands that you're having difficulties playing League of Legends right now; as I'm sure you understand, if this does happen to be an issue for certain people right now, they will get working on it. The fact remains that he probably isn't a person who can solve your (as well as various others') issues at the moment.\n\nPut a bit of trust into the staffing of a game which you seem highly dedicated to, or at least extremely invested in. Riot (a.k.a. Rito) hasn't let me down in the five years I've been playing this game, so I trust them to resolve this issue if it does happen to be something with the servers or game in EUW.\n\n{{champion:103}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bearded Johnson","date":"2014-12-17T00:35:48.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Quiet,realm=EUW,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=4EcNwG5w,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2014-12-16T23:14:25.491+0000)\n>\n> Are there any news about the FPS problem too?\n\nThey probably won't tell us if there is.
