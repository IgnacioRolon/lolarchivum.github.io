The souls used to interact with the shield by giving it bonus AP, and the shield scaled off of AP. Now, the souls will \"directly\" buff the shield by, say, causing each soul he has to give it a better value.

Having it scale with his passive directly is nice, but without ap ratio its a major late game nerf.\nGive back (even if not the full) ap ratio if you want to make him more buffed (i don' know why though, he had fine ratios before this patch)\n\nReducing Blitz ulti cd on early so he can't wave clear with it every sec was really on spot and looooooooong needed, but with 20 cd on late game with his current ratios (often hits over 700 coming from a tank with 0 ap or special focus on damage)  and its silence and that size of area its just game breaking, and with 5- sec (!) power first on a spell with 1 sec knock-up enemy can't even run away.

The cd's just too high for that now.

That's how long you have to use the enhanced AA before it's too late and the skill goes on cooldown.  It gives him less time to use it not more (though honestly, it's a QoL buff if you ask me, I want that thing to reset sooner if I don't have a target in 5 seconds).
