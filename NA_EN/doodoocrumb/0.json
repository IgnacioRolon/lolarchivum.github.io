Why not just make them a refillable item like the refillable potions?  I understand if u have 23456 mana pots and you can push turret nonstop thats op, but if you just have 2 that refill? why not?{{item:2031}}","replies":[{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2015-11-23T20:21:11.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm i like the idea. Make it so you cant buy individual mana pots but you can buy just the refillable one. Holds 2 charges, each charge gives 100 mana, refills upon revisiting the shop. I think this is certainly viable","replies":[]}]}
