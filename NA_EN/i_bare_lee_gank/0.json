I play on a MacBook Pro 15.6 Inch 2016; Processor 2.6GHz; Intel Core i7; macOS Sierra; Version 10.12.6. My connection runs on 30 mbps and a consistent 59 ms in game. After champion select when the client transitions into loading screen with the champion cards my screen turns white. It proceeds to inform me to retry to connect or cancel. After repeated attempts to reconnect I close the client. Granted this problem happens occasionally, I haven't been able to relieve these 20 min queues because of the reoccurring \" Away From Keyboard \" due to not being able to reconnect. I have done some research i.e. reviewing different forums and eventually discovering that other Mac Users have been dealing with this same problem. It seems for most Mac users the issues range from weak processors to old versions of make that aren't compatible or suited for League of Legends, but for most Mac users it seems there is a problem with the new patches in the 7.1.
