I get how they prefer in-combat regen than passive regen, but isn't the point you should get __more__ from it when you take risks, instead of getting __almost nothing__? I.e. ulting lvl 16 Swain will get like 5 HP  every second from new Catalyst. Now compare it to Graves' lifesteal...\n\nThis is worse than pathethic. Like I said - I hope Riot will update mana pools accordingly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2016-04-14T19:01:58.713+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You guys can always just accept that in the early game you'll need to play conservatively and back more often, and in the late game you will ALWAYS need to secure blue buff as much as possible. \n\nYou will also need the mastery that increases buff times, which means no more biscuits.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zarkkast","date":"2016-04-14T13:33:11.091+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{item:3040}} {{item:3027}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ironicio","date":"2016-04-15T03:17:41.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ill just play viegar {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"agbudar","date":"2016-04-15T00:05:38.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not play mage and finally just bend over and get myself to be a zed/yassuo main? idk im not really looking forward to it. they are most likely taking mana returns away from our skills as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2016-04-15T00:02:36.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3070}} {{item:3165}} if I want to invest into mid/late game damage\n\nFor {{champion:112}} probably just {{item:3165}} or {{item:3100}} but Tear will refund mana now, so it's definitely worth trying, not to mention the synergy with his Hex Core.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gigahappytown","date":"2016-04-14T23:14:08.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riots shifting mages from mana regen to high mana pools and doubling blue buffs mana regen\n\nthe point of this is have non tanky mages restricted to a moderate window where they can cast spells instead of afking from 2 screens away and spamming spells with infinite mana\n\nwhile tanky mages that can survive in the middle of a fight will get items give mana regeneration","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2016-04-14T21:47:24.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assuming Morellos does indeed gain Athene's on-kill or on-assist %max mana restore, I imagine a combo of lost chapter/morellonomicon and tear of the goddess/arch angels staff.\n\nI actually don't think it will be a humongous problem, to be honest.\n\nAnd if it is, they are willing to make changes.
