Now everyone seems to think the game should be fair and balanced when in reality we're still technically on the preseason patch, an out of whack one with too much snowballing, even for my liking.\n\nFirst and foremost, they should have under no circumstance released Camille when they did. They released a champion that is hitting 54% on release **and climbing.** This is absurd, especially considering the season just started and there's already a ban taken out of the way. \n\nThey started the ranked season, released a brand new champion that is clearly overtuned along with a swoth of other changes then had the audacity to go on a week or two break for the holidays. Don't get me wrong, taking a break isn't bad, but releasing so much and just letting it fester in your game with no changes for so long is poor business practice and should be shunned. They didn't even have the courtesy to wait until after their break before releasing these changes and that's why the community is so pissed. \n\nEven Reddit, a place usually full of plays from streamers and e-sports talk is filled with gameplay threads, mostly stating ADC's are weak (not entirely true).

Botlane has the largest effect, but teleporting down means if you need to rapidly apply pressure, the opponent will back off to make sure they aren't overwhelmed and play it out safely. Meanwhile, your top opponent, who may or may not be leading or losing, gets to freely waveclear because Teleporting bot means he has a free lane to CS and ensure to gain back losses or even snowball a lead. Teleport is good for going into teamfights or helping objective control is only good when it is remotely in the jungle, and they can risk the opponent backing off which means it wasn't a waste of a summoner. Into late game, teleport becomes either a heavy splitpushing tool or teleporting into a jungle zone for dragon control or preparing for a teamfight in certain lanes. Wildly teleporting to apply pressure is stupid, and overall, your comment is extremely arrogant considering we all know it is a bot lane meta where if the jungle comes and ganks, which is much harder to predict, you have overall better map coverage, and forces teleport into a summoner used to just get back to lane or help jump towards an enlongated teamfight. Half the time its not even about positioning, its just \"what is the current situation and will my opponent be able to respond to it?\" because I've teleported in as Kled all the way behind enemy turret, began my ult, and even with that pressure the opponent back off and just ignored us.
