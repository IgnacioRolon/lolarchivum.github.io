I have no FPS or ping changes, my ping pretty much stays at 46 all the time and my FPS are around 150, but every 30-40-50 seconds or so I just lose control of my champion. Everything around still moves, but my champion freezes and won't cast spells/move/auto attack or do anything I tell it to do. It's very frustrating and sometime I die because I clicked undertower just to walk close to it but my champions keeps moving and I can't stop it, or sometime I get attacked and litteraly cannot do anything but watch myself die. The freezes last for about 1-3 seconds but thats enough to lose a fight... Is there any solution to this problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-29T23:59:18.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're having lag spikes or a network issue, and not necessarily fps.
