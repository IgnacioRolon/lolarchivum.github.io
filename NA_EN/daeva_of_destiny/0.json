SO I was playing till like 4 am (i am a addict), and I return to league after work at 9 pm, and I haven't touched my computer since I played league last night, other than downloading music. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling because that usually fixes all my problems but this one didnt fix. Same issue, but heres another thing, after I installed league there are no files for it on my computer, so I cant even send logs in with my ticket. Its like \"Hey  heres the icon to open league, but thats all you get\"\r\n\r\nSo if you've encountered this before, do you know what to do?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-15T17:49:17.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Patcher Kernel errors usual occur from permissions issue on your OS blocking files from being accessed or written.  Running the installation As Administrator might be a good first step here.
