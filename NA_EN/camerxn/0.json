They've been known to cause crashes in areas like champ select and hextech crafting and might be worth removing if so.  Fortunately, even though the animation might crash it will still reach our servers.  I do see that 3 fragments were crafted for a key, and then used to open a mastery chest.  It looks like your chest rewarded the following:\n\n150 Orange Essence\n1 Battlecast Icon\n\nI hope that helps clear things up, and congrats!","replies":[{"poster":"Camerxn","date":"2016-10-22T23:49:43.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do have plays.tv, I may remove it.
