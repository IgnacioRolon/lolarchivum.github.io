I already owned Riot Kayle so I was expecting a Mystery Gift, but I waited.  I saw a few reds respond to the same problem with the day not being over yet, and a link to the support banner, but when I clicked the link, it was dead and now it is October.  I was wondering if I just got it but it didn't notify me.  If so, could you tell me which?  I own a lot of skins for a lot of champs.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-04T23:01:53.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you still have yet to receive the rest of the gift, I recommend reaching out to our specialists in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

As several people pointed out, the support banner indicating the status of the ongoing delivery process was removed yesterday (which was the last day, which one would assume means the delivery is over). Nevertheless a few of us got responded by reds stating that the 30th of September was still not over and that the \"goodies would come\", they also linked the dead support banner, which of course didn't work.\n\nNow is October, the 30th is over, and the support banner they linked remains deleted, having no way of knowing if the process is really over, if we are still receiving the gift, or if we are now in the time period to ask for it if we were left out. It's radio silence all over again.\n\nMust add that these event seem to happen to me everytime Riot sends out gifts like these: the date expiring, and having to ask for the gift in a support ticket, which they provide without any problems, but makes me wonder if there are people who cannot be reached by the account gifting system.","replies":[]}]}
