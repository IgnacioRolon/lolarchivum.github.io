They are constantly warding the jungle, protecting their jungler, and denying vision in the jungle. This allows for junglers in particular to exert a pressure upon a lane when their general whereabouts are unknown. Objectively, your jungle is the team captain, if they say to push bot lane, you push it. They're more focused about gaining a foothold on the map to potentially set up another push/future dragon as the enemy bot lane overextends to farm or maybe the rest of the team needs global gold asap. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe jungler is a game changing role, they should control the flow of the game the most in comparison to your team mates during the laning phase. With that in mind, you as (insert role) should assist with the success of your junglers early buffs. \r\n\r\nTop Laner\r\n-Leash if requested\r\n-Get to your jungle's entrance asap to provide early vision coverage.\r\n-Ward top side river bush by 1:45 as protection against the enemy junglers lvl 2 invade.\r\n-Be wary of jungler pings on your half of the map\r\n-Respond to an invade, go to the bot side buff pre-laning phase if you can do so without hurting your laning phase, minus the usage of teleport.\r\n\r\nMid laner\r\n-Ward the bottom side river bush nearest to mid lane by 1:45 as protection against he enemy junglers lvl 2 invade.\r\n-Respond to an invade\r\n-Be wary of any jungler pings\r\n\r\nBot laners\r\n-Leash if requested\r\n-Ward possible enemy cheese bushes by 1:00 to protect yourself from lane failure\r\n-Respond to an invade bot side.\r\n\r\nThe junglers shouldn't have both buffs until ~3:00, meaning most of the trinket wards are nearly done resetting. If you've properly set up your jungler for success, they should have both of their buffs. At this point it's up to the jungler to depict the flow of the game. By 7 minutes, the game has likely resulted in the evident side having an advantage, perhaps bot lane has an enemy ezreal being 2/0, maybe your mid laner is up 30 cs on their foe, or perhaps top lane is apart of the rift again, every game plays differently. The jungler is going to assess the best course of action to gain/hold the lead. That may include keeping all their buffs round 2 , or giving them away.\r\n\r\nReasons for withholding blue buff from the mid laner\r\n-{{champion:157}}  Could be 100/0, but still isn't going to get a blue buff, it's practically pointless on him\r\n-Mid laner is dying often to the enemy laner because of skill/rough matchup\r\n-Jungle is snowballing much better than mid and would be able to continue the snowballing to others\r\n\r\nReasons for giving a buff away\r\n-Laner is snowballing and would benefit more from the buff than the jungler\r\n-Laner may not benefit as greatly as the jungler, but the jungler has recently acquired jungle buffs from the enemy.\r\n\r\nThere should never be \"If you don't give me ____ buff I'll afk.\" This is a team game, and at this point in the game, the jungler is the captain. Listen to their pings. If you spend time typing and end up losing cs/dying as a result, you've accomplished nothing by bickering. Granted the laner may be right over the jungler, it's gonna happen, most/all of us aren't in challenger, but that doesn't mean don't follow up on the call. More times than not, following up on a bad call results in a better outcome than if everyone is split in decision. If 4 of the team dies, but only 3 die on the enemy team, they can't push objectives as well as they could have if 2 people on your team die, but the enemy team suffers no causalities.\r\n\r\nWarding\r\n-Aside from the pre-laning phase warding, theres no time warranted warding, it's done whenever you can. Once you can buy a pink ward, grab it, those things can last over 3 minutes AND you're able to kill the other wards.\r\n-Drop that yellow ward at some point, it's great early game, but killing wards out isn't as easy as season 3, everyone needs to get a red trinket to clear wards out from your jungle that give an advantage to the enemy team. Your jungler loses pressure when they're known to be on the complete other side of the map. \r\n-Warding the enemy's jungle takes pressure off the map, laners can make aggressive plays without repercussion of an enemy jungler gank.\r\n-Baron and dragon are game changers, obviously baron is weighted heavier.\r\n \r\nWorking together as a team is a lot more fun than showing everyone the bird. The jungle is huge part in why teamwork is op. If there wasn't a jungle, this game would be similiar to a Call of Duty lobby team. Whichever team is individually skilled is less likely to lose.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Note**- rough draft of a rant that became a guide. I have not/will not revise any points for grammar reasons. I may clarify thoughts if needed later on.","replies":[]}
