I can't tell you for sure that your connection will be perfect, but unless everyone is heavily multitasking or video streaming, I can't see your proposed package speed being an issue.\n\nIf you happen to experience issues after getting everything set up, please let me know.\n\nP.S. Congrats on the new apartment. I hope your neighbors don't mind the victory cheers when you steal baron or get that sweet penta kill. :P","replies":[{"poster":"Devonology","date":"2016-12-15T02:04:05.915+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Appreciate the response, will definitely let you know how it's going after we get everything set up!
