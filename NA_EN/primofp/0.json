If I'm understanding the logs correctly, the guy came up to your lane, fed your laner a kill, and then proceeded to either die in your lane, or get you killed every time he came up after that.  That's enough to make anyone frustrated, which is perfectly reasonable and understandable.  Where it crosses the line is when you begin to berate him, which is the third line of text.  And it continues throughout the entire log.  Calling him useless, idiot, trash, trolling, atrocious, criticizing his plays, and calling for reports on him multiple times.  These sorts of things are not only unnecessary, they are not helpful to the game.  Constantly berating a teammate is never going to make them play better, and is only going to risk demoralizing the rest of your team.\n\nBottom line, these logs are very much so against the Terms of Use, and definitely warrant a punishment.  The level of punishment is determined entirely based upon what levels of punishment the account has already incurred.  As this was your first, it's a 10 game chat restriction.  If this sort of behavior continues, then it will progress to a 25 game chat restriction, and so forth.    \n\nFrom the [Instant Feedback System FAQs:](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286)\n> PUNISHMENTS GENERALLY FOLLOW A BASIC ESCALATION PATH:\n> \n> * First Offense: 10 Game Chat Restriction\n> * Second Offense: 25 Game Chat Restriction\n> * Third Offense: Two Week Suspension\n> * Fourth Offense: Permanent Suspension\n> \n> However, it is possible to skip to a Two Week or Permanent suspension based on the severity of the behavior in the game. Excessive negative behavior can result in a Two-Week or Permanent suspension at any time without having a chat restriction on the account.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2017-10-07T01:56:15.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.
