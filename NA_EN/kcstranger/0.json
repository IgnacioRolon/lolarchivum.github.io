Such champions will be losing 1 mana regen/5 (per rank in the mastery) but gaining 25 total mana (per rank). So, the amount of additional mana provided by these masteries will be the same after 125 s (2:05 minutes) on the field. This feels to me like a nerf to the early laning of champions like Syndra, Ziggs, Xerath, Lux, Kassadin, etc. who need to stay out to farm for several (i.e., more than two) minutes at a time in the early part of the game. For my part, I play Syndra and know that I have to be very careful with my spell casts until I&#039;m able to afford Athene&#039;s or something similar. Some won&#039;t have a problem with this (and I do think there are some positive things about these changes as well), but for my part I feel that these mages are already a little too strapped for mana in the early game, and I&#039;m afraid these changes would exacerbate that.\r\n\r\nWould be interested to hear any thoughts on this. Granted, it&#039;s a rather small difference I&#039;m discussing, but sometimes the difference between winning or losing an encounter is having the mana to get that one last spellcast off.","replies":[{"poster":"Zarxis","date":"2015-05-18T22:11:46.348+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":4,"body":"I'm not sure why Riot thinks it's necessary to nerf the mana regen of the champions that already had their mana regen nerfed through {{item:3174}} and the % base mana regen changes that were introduced at the beginning of Season 5.

Forcing mana-strapped champions like Lux and Ziggs to take 21 points in utility just to keep their current sub-par levels of mana sustain is really going to hurt their viability; they need 21 points in Offense to keep up in terms of damage while they buy their mana items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2015-05-18T22:13:06.108+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nice stealth buff to {{champion:13}} early game.
