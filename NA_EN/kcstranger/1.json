Most of the messages I've seen from him were really explanations of what it does more than discussion of what he should change. He might have quite an opinion of himself, but I could be wrong","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yorukin","date":"2015-08-14T02:43:54.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try \"alongside\" instead of \"with\". English is an odd language, so knowing how to twist it in your favor helps.\n\nOn topic, I have to agree with this. CertainlyT makes some kits that are fantastic to play around as, but they tend to feel overloaded as a result. Even the less loaded kits like Zyra still have a lot going on with them. Playing against them can also be kind of a pain, as they can simply do so _much_ that you need to watch out for.\n\nPersonally, I'd like to see CT and Repertoir collaborate on a champion design/update in the future. He makes a great ideas guy, but Repertoir has a much better rapport with the community and (so far) has a tendency to undershoot on the initial design, rather than CT's persistent habit of overshooting and leaving them frustratingly strong for a patch or two.","replies":[{"poster":"DorkunedAuras","date":"2015-08-14T06:11:16.620+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's something I've said before. CT would benefit from, instead of being a full champ creator, he's just a person who vomits out cool ideas for kits or mechanics, then other people write them down, and they get reasonable people to create champs based off the mechanics. Sure he can be involved in the processes, but I don't really trust him to independently make his own champs anymore.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2015-08-14T01:26:14.412+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Main weakness: Seems not to consider carefully enough the question, \"Would a champion with this kit be frustrating to play with or against?\"\n\nWhat do you mean \"seems?\"  He has no comprehension of what a healthy kit looks like and has gone above and beyond to prove he doesn't care.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-08-14T00:50:51.268+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm generally of the opinion that most of his champions problem come from adding in extraneous mechanics. For example; does Thresh really need good poke, via his flay passive? He already has good engage. He already has better poke than Blitz or Leona, and the only thing removing it will do is annoy the very few people who play him AD. His actual mechanics and fluidity of his kit would not change.","replies":[{"poster":"Pale Pirate","date":"2015-08-14T01:20:41.049+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes! His champions just have too many things at once, at least until they get nerfed.

Why? Because Thresh literally goes and does anything and he makes it work. You can play him Top, Mid, Jungle, ADC, Support, and he's still able to be strong. Throw {{champion:429}}  in as a Jungler or {{champion:157}}  as a Support and they'll do terrible, on top of that you have to have certain builds on both of them unlike Thresh. Thresh can go AP and have his abilities do insane damage with a pretty big shield with his passive that also grants him free AP, go AD and literally one shot the enemy carry at full build, or go tank and with his stacking Armor be a huge juggernaut.\n\nThresh is just able to do literally everything and anything with any build at all in the game. Playing Thresh in Ultimate Bravery isn't even a challenge because he makes it work and does extremely well.\n\nSeriously, Thresh can fulfill every single role and he does it so well. His only fall off is having low auto attack range but then again his hook has a pretty big range and the hitbox isn't the best. And before you say that he can't Jungle, you should probably see what some of these Thresh players are doing with him in solo queue.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GloriousKaiser","date":"2015-08-14T15:48:08.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's more that Certainly lacks restraint is what his weakness is.\n\nI'm not about to believe that only he has come up with Whacky champion kits and ideas. The Creative team at Riot is more than that.\n\nBut IMO at least other designers tone down their ideas. They're not about to infect the integrity of their games balance in order to overload a champions abilities.","replies":[]},{"poster":"foinhas","date":"2015-08-14T11:28:22.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my opinion his kits are just too hard to balance: they're either too overwhelming or too underwhelming.","replies":[]},{"poster":"2nMdDVW9Nu","date":"2015-08-14T06:30:36.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think with how hes trying to REMOVE the adc position which is such a balanced position in the grand scheme to make something that makes no fucking sense with the game balancing for what I can conclude as \"funsies\" logic makes me despise his thought process.
