They can do their best to try and ban accounts that they believe to be bought/sold, but that only goes so far.\n\nThey can ban for intentional feeding, and if it makes you feel any better, that would mean that the person that bought the account would be out that amount of money each time.","replies":[{"poster":"Invemega","date":"2017-04-21T04:06:28.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't believe such scumbags exist.

That without the risk of being socially shunned by society, friends, and family, many people are complete and total assholes that care little about what their actions do to others.\n\n>Atleast not with the technology Riot is using.\n\nWith the technology anyone is using, account buying will exist, **_especially_** for a FTP game.","replies":[{"poster":"Invemega","date":"2017-04-21T04:16:57.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I meant restricting someone to playing their game no matter their location.\nThat's what Riot or any FTP game's technology doesn't have.\nIf they did have it, many of the people who I encountered in my game would be driven away from stuff like this, and it would be a benefit to the entire game industry.\n\nBut sadly that won't happen.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-04-21T10:23:23.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IP bans don't really do anything, even if you don't use a VPN.

That's what makes intentional feeding bans so rare, it's hard for an automated system to know the difference.","replies":[{"poster":"Invemega","date":"2017-04-21T04:11:13.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That guy didn't care about winning or playing the game after he told the team he was going to intentionally feed. Plus him feeding intentionally is not the only proof; he admitted to account buying and I have screenshots proving this, which I sent to Riot with a ticket.\n\nMy biggest concern is that players like that are allowed to play this game and avoid the consequences tremendously. Imagine them having a bank of hundreds of accounts and each time of them gets banned, they hop onto another one and continue int feeding until the stock is gone or their share of fun has depleted...\nIt is the worst feeling to play with such a human being.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-04-21T04:19:52.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This guy didn't care, but there are others who do care and are trying who might get tagged if the automated system is too strict. Riot errs on the side of not banning an innocent rather than trying to ban all the guilty in this manner.\n\nIt's only fun for them if people react.
