Frostbite has an interesting roster, but other than that there aren&#039;t many teams on the left side of the bracket that have as much experience and pedigree. While some of those teams may impress and show up really strong and that&#039;s great bc the scene is growing then, what happens if they don&#039;t? What if the 4 teams I listed first are the absolute best of the tournament and knock each other out before the loser 1 and 2 from the right side of the bracket completely stomp the hell out of 1 and 2 from the left side of the bracket? Shouldn&#039;t there be a chance for an early knock out strong team to show they just happened to get beat by the team that&#039;s going to take first to prove they still deserve a shot?","replies":[{"poster":"Ale non è male","date":"2015-12-10T11:03:26.350+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not even a double elimination format would be so helpful, tbh\n\nThe problem is that ditching entirely challenger ladder was not a good idea, especially when the requisite to get to the Open Qualifiers were so broad \nChallenger ladder should at least give some seeding to the top teams to give byes and such, and once you choose to admit teams made by soloQ players, you should at least put an higher threesold to their soloQ ranking (something like only D1 50+LP/Masters/Challenger)\nThis way it is just mess and luck...\n\nAnd consider that in NA you are pretty much lucky because the difference between top teams and the other is huude, in Eu it has been a completley mess the situation\n\nThe 2 best teams on challenger ladder didn't get the bye and has to play the 1st round and has ended up on the same side quarter of the bracket, LOL...and this while Open Qualifier giving only 1 spot to CS Qualifiers","replies":[{"poster":"T RexHasTinyArms","date":"2015-12-10T21:23:49.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah but double elimination would remove sides to a bracket and even if they faced in round 1 the 2nd best team could grind through the losers bracket and get to second in order to face the other second place team for the third spot.","replies":[{"poster":"Tiza","date":"2015-12-10T22:45:33.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=T RexHasTinyArms,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=FndRVAoj,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-12-10T21:23:49.122+0000)\n>\n> yeah but double elimination would remove sides to a bracket and even if they faced in round 1 the 2nd best team could grind through the losers bracket and get to second in order to face the other second place team for the third spot.\n\nDouble elimination also literally doubles the number of matches that needs to be played, and the amount of time required to run the tournament, and it's not nearly helpful enough at reducing variance as it costs.\n\nWe make matches Bo3 because that greatly decreases variance with less overhead, and more consistency with our other formats.  Double elimination might make sense in a world where we believed in Bo1s, but we run with Bo3s instead.\n\nThere's some discussion to be had about seeding process, but double elimination isn't a good response to \"what if the seeding is bad?\"  The better response is to get a better seeding model. =)","replies":[{"poster":"Ale non è male","date":"2015-12-10T23:06:08.545+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, Tiza, glad that as Rioter you responded\n\nI think that challenger ladder should give a sort of priority on open Qualifier seeding, such that the team at the top of challenger ladder can at least get byes and avoid meet each other in the first rounds (sort of like, top 4 teams are placed on the 4 different quartes, and when there are byes at the first round you give them following the order of challanger ladder)\nThis way, if you want to run Open Qualifiers, you can give a lot of teams the chances to partecipate, but at least you still made a bit meaningful to climb the challenger ladder","replies":[{"poster":"Tiza","date":"2015-12-11T23:49:47.677+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ale non è male,realm=EUW,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=FndRVAoj,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2015-12-10T23:06:08.545+0000)\n>\n> Hey, Tiza, glad that as Rioter you responded\n> \n> I think that challenger ladder should give a sort of priority on open Qualifier seeding, such that the team at the top of challenger ladder can at least get byes and avoid meet each other in the first rounds (sort of like, top 4 teams are placed on the 4 different quartes, and when there are byes at the first round you give them following the order of challanger ladder)\n> This way, if you want to run Open Qualifiers, you can give a lot of teams the chances to partecipate, but at least you still made a bit meaningful to climb the challenger ladder\n\nThe Challenger tier in particular isn't compelling - ranked teams just isn't taken seriously by top players, and despite _three years_ of saying \"Play Ranked Teams to qualify into the LCS!\" that didn't change.

In the end you had to give up your CS chances if you were with a 55-60% win rate against teams rated below you in the ladder, because even at that win rate you earn so few LP for win and lose so much for loss that you always stayed at around the same amount of LP\nThe top teams thus hended to create private scrimming channel circuit outside of challenger ladder if they wanted to play each other and scrim and test theirselves without putting in danger their precious LP and their chances to get to CS qualifiers\n\nI don't think these teams would have had trouble to keep playing in challenger ladder rather than private scrim channles (were there were still problems when teams couldn't show up to estabilished times and such) if there wasn't so much to lose for them, but still you need to give them something to earn for playing in challenger ladder vs number 45 team in ladder rather than only play vs selected teams in scrim channel rather of proven level to improve themselves even in losses, thus reducing also queue times that were a big problem\n\nI think that when taking into consideration the decision if changing access to CS, you basically looked primarily to NA region rather than looking at both.\nIn NA, historically there has been very few challenger teams beyond the lowest level of official competition (Regional circuit first, LCS and CS later) and a little amount of tournaments played , especially LAn tournaments, between these kind of teams for a number of reason (lack of local organizers, extension of the region with unfortunate placing of the servers for teams of East Coast, etc).\nIn EU, because of the fact there are various countries and e-sports orgs in each countries, there have been far more teams and far more tournaments to play for those teams, either online or in a LAN environment for a number of reasons (histroically having more tournament organizers, even local organizers, so that every country had at minimum 3-4 kinda of relevant tournaments without countign the biggest one, server being in a generally more favourbale position for a good portion of the region, etc...)\n\nThis is imho the reason why , without intent of bashing NA, EU region has produced far more talent than NA region and why EU teams have historically performed better than NA teams internationally despite both servers starting at about same time and e-sports have similar kind of consideration and social reception in both continents...and not the number of players in each server, since is safe to assume that purely physical and mechanical attributes to have high mechanical skills have a gaussian distribution and so both regions should have far more than enough the amount of players with high enough mechanics to play as pros without suffering from drop offs in talent pool from other regions with more players\nNA has never truly had a mechanical skills problem with their players, but all those skills that separated strong teams from less strong teams were less developed in an environment like NA where there is less competition among teams at all levels and thus the players that can properly play well at certain levels in the contest of strong teams weren't tested and properly separated in the various tiers as they should\n\nBoth the Western regions should aim to improve their level competitively, but this way NA player development does not improve and EU player development become worse, thus setting both regions behind the Asian regions, and forcing them to go for the import route to stay competitive, which is something that decreases the attachment to a team and to the entire region imho","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
