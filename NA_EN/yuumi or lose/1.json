What if the Voidlings from the Portal were focused on getting to the enemy wave and then exploding, doing a decent chunk of damage to Champions - and bonus damage to Minions.\n\nSo if you're at a tower, you drop a portal behind your frontline and let the Voidlings skitter over to the enemy team. Upon death or decay, they blow up, which would chunk away at the minion waves and grind down any Champs in the way. If you're trying to defend a tower, this lets you keep the enemy minion waves from gaining any momentum, stopping the enemy team from an easy tower dive (since they will usually wait for a creep wave to come and take tower agro so the initiator can get in range without taking damage). And if there arent minions it serves as a poke for the Champs, discouraging them from sieging.\n\nIf you're on the sieging side, waiting at the enemy's tower, you drop it for the same purpose - to burst down their minions waves (thus letting yours get to the tower faster and let you dive/push), and to harass the enemy team that is trying to defend the tower. Right now the Rot usually seems so pointless, since you can easily pick the Voidlings off, and its usually left unattended. Instead, the voidlings would be a potential threat, blowing up when they get killed.\n\nSo Ohm would retain the \"turn tower off and dive like a submarine\", while Rot would become the \"Stop Standing Around The Tower\" item.","replies":[{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2015-10-18T04:20:50.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i mean the team pokes at the enemy while voidlings do damage to towers.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GundayMonday","date":"2015-10-18T01:35:26.979+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just because no one's using it, doesn't mean it isn't good.","replies":[{"poster":"Miraweave","date":"2015-10-19T07:37:03.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GundayMonday,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QAXgX9xG,comment-id=0004000000000000,timestamp=2015-10-18T01:35:26.979+0000)\n>\n> Just because no one's using it, doesn't mean it isn't good.\n\n^\n\nI had some stupidly high winrate on Zz'Rot Garen before the Garen rework, just because you'd rush the thing and be tanky enough and fast enough to escape from two or three people, but still be a tower killing threat that required an answer.
