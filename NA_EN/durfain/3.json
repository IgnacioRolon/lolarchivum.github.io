It would be great if you could make deathcap build out of two rods since at this point in the game this really helps out with the inventory space problem.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-03-27T11:16:32.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This would actually be a great change. Sure having it build out of more tome and wand makes it easier to switch out of,  but pretty much any high ap item has a NLR in it so its not like you wont use it.  Also this would allow for the combine cost to be 1500, 100 gold cheaper than the old NLR.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ElysMustache","date":"2016-03-27T11:56:00.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They already lowered the cost of NLR. Certain items have space-taking build paths for a reason. Very strong items shouldn't be easy/convenient to obtain.","replies":[]}]}
