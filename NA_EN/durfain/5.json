His engage is subpar.\n\nThe problem with maokai as a support is that braum basically does what he does only infinitely better. Not only is his cc \"Ranged\" (maokai actually has to get up close to the enemies in order to use it), but the vision you get from those saplings (only lasting 1min or so, making them a bit meaningless once you get a sightstone) is mitigated by the fact that braum can stop objective steals. Unless you're running a comp specifically around him, then I can't really see why he's worth playing in the support role.","replies":[{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2017-01-07T18:31:32.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maokai also has a ranged slow on his saplings. It's mostly useful for weak disengage (when enemy is chasing you) than engage or pick, though.\n\nSaplings also have much longer range than sightstone, so you won't be caught off when going to ward, and you can also ward more areas since saplings don't count as wards. Maokai can provide so much vision, and do so safely. This is useful not only for Dragon and Baron, but also for sieging towers. Not to mention, sightstone has a limited charge system.\n\nThere's also that Braum has no quick hard CC besides his ultimate. Maokai has a low cooldown knockup/slow, and a targeted snare.\n\nHis vision tool is not as weak as you think. He's not the best support, but he isn't completely outclassed by Braum either.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2017-01-08T21:42:59.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is rather odd how that is.
