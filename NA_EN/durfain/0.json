(60 second cooldown triggering on dropping low makes the rune much more powerful against burst than any other sort of damage) Part of the reason players want this rune to work against Talon, Zed, etc. is that it is very well designed to defend against those champions while it is poorly designed to defend against iterative poke (which is spaced out more evenly meaning less of the impact will be negated by the shield and more of the shield is likely to be wasted). \n\n> \"When we tested weaker general versions of the rune, it stopped being understandable. Shields that pop in reaction to damage tend to get crushed by the incoming damage, and this is especially true at small values.\"\n\nIf the versions weren't balanced properly (were too weak) then bringing them in in a discussion of the design of the rune when properly balanced isn't hugely relevant. If on the other hand these versions of the rune were the balanced version (which I am guessing is what you are trying to say though I'm reading between the lines a bit here) then what you've just expressed is that the rune has comprehension issues when balanced properly which is an inherent problem with the design, NOT an incentive to balance it improperly to fix the comprehension issues (which, if you were trying to talk about the balance of the rune, is what you have done). \n\nI understand that just complaining doesn't actually help you solve any issues so I'd like to offer a few different solutions and discuss their merits.\n\n1) Remove the rune and replace it with another option: If the rune is as binary as you have said it is then it's not a real option, it's a false choice (like old runes) that players either make correctly and get to play the game or make incorrectly and lose an extra N% of the time because they didn't do a bunch of research outside of the game. If you believe that's the case then the rune should be removed, false choices aren't fun or interesting, they're just bad design. Unfortunately the downside here is that you no longer have a solution to the problem Nulifying Orb was trying to solve so you have to come up with a new solution. This takes design time and resources as well as art assets so this is likely the most costly and slowest solution.\n\n2) Make the rune not care about the damage type: If the rune is basically fine as is and is an acceptable strategic option against Lux or Diana then making it available as a strategic option against Jayce and Zed shouldn't be a problem. This is a very easy solution to implement though it carries balance implications down the road. This does add unintended extra tankyness when taking mixed damage after lane which might add a lot of hidden power. On the other hand it takes significantly less time and resources as it is a very small change.\n\n3) Add a new rune without removing nulifying orb which is functionally identical except it only triggers from physical damage: If the rune is fine for lane matchups but adds unnecessary extra tankyness against mixed damage later in the game then allowing a similar option against AD champions shouldn't be a problem and by keeping it to only defending against one damage type you avoid some of the lategame blowback of just generalized tankyness. I imagine that in time and resources this is a middle of the road approach because a lot of the work from Nullifying Orb can be reused but you still need to make art assets and change the layout of the rune tree.\n\nTLDR: there are better approaches to nullifying orb than the one in game, I think it should be replaced or changed, but there are a lot of different ways it could be changed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Landorin","date":"2017-11-17T22:39:38.414+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I believe it's important for a number of mages to have a way to plan for a lane where the range disparity against other mages is a defining element of the early game, so I would prefer we don't remove the option outright. \n\nThe thing is, that I don't believe that anybody is picking Nullifying Orb for these cases. If anything, I think it's more common to see Manaflow Band in that case so you can just outshove. Where people do pick Nullifying Orb tends to be in matchups where you're at risk of being all-in'd, i.e. against AP assassins or burst mages. This cuts down on their power considerably since they tend to rely on snowballing to hit their one-shot benchmarks later in the game, while long range mages in mid don't really care as much if they get denied a kill or two in laning phase.\n\nSo, if the intention is to have a rune to stymie burst champions from snowballing, that's fine, but I don't see any reason it shouldn't apply equally to AD and AP. If anything, I would argue it should apply solely to AD damage since they tend to have the tools to finish off champions who don't die in one rotation (auto-attacks), while AP burst champs don't tend to have that sort of fallback pattern. If a hypothetical physical version of Nullifying Orb gives you enough HP to survive a Zed rotation, he can risk himself somewhat to throw in an extra auto-attack or two. In contrast, if Nullifying Orb gives you enough HP to survive a Fizz rotation, you probably just walk away and recall.\n\nIf the intention is really to introduce parity between casters of differing ranges, then I would say that Nullifying Orb does a poor job of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2017-11-17T21:42:07.536+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"Well, I think we're having a relatively even and nice discussion over on the \"Let's Discuss Runes Reforged\" thread that the mods pinned.\n\nAs for the constant whining about assassins, please do not listen to it.

Soz, I forgot that ADC&#x27;s and AD assassins were the only classes allowed to do dmg in league atm.\n\nyeah, because mages are only a DPS class and not a control/burst/dps/whatever the hell they want it to be class. You are not fixing anything by moving this to be a mastery on the resolve tree, you are making it worst for everyone. Even in mage vs mage scenarios. Why not make a completely new mastery that does what this one does but for physical damage? or why not just change this to be something similar to Camille's passive (albeit obviously weaker) ? no! let's screw over everyone over just because the poor mages aren't able to completely demolish everything in their path","replies":[{"poster":"Great Fox","date":"2017-11-17T05:03:14.425+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"False, there are various types of mages.\n\nBurst Mage, such as; {{champion:103}} {{champion:134}} \nControl Mage, such as; {{champion:34}} {{champion:99}} \nDPS Mage, such as; {{champion:268}} {{champion:90}}","replies":[{"poster":"D4ziri","date":"2017-11-17T10:47:04.506+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Isn't Lux Burst/Artillery?\nAhri is AP assassin in my mind scenarios.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"NotCounter","date":"2017-11-17T01:10:41.280+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"I genuinely don't understand why that exists and there's no compensation for physical damage","replies":[{"poster":"PrinceOfStorms","date":"2017-11-17T03:07:00.815+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":4,"body":"Because Riot hates AP champions and won't nerf AD because then it would hurt their golden role, the ADC, that never gets the winrate crippling nerfs that it deserves.","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2017-11-17T04:27:17.582+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":">that never gets the winrate crippling nerfs that it deserves. \n\nThe game revolves around the ADC's ability to kill anything.

As harsh as it sounds, Riot focuses around the meta happening in higher ranks. Assassins are RARE because the meta for the past season has been around the ADC's ability to carry into the late-game. Unless its your blind pick normal games, assassins don't usually carry late game. Its much better having a mage with AOE damage and AOE CC, than an assassin who gets 1 pick then dies right after.\n\nEDIT : I misread that post. Lots of ADC champs get huge nerfs though. Draven and his HUGE passive nerf almost single handedly destroyed his winrate (This was quite a while ago), Caitlyn got HUGE nerfs earlier this year (of course she got buffs earlier) and lucian who was the dominant in literally every lane is barely a viable pick in any lane anymore.
