Manipulating a minion wave for lane defense or offense IS a skill test in League and it's a major contributor to how a lot of lanes play. There's a cost to Blitzcrank charging you directly with a clump of minions in his path. Annie needs to expose herself to skillshots to have a clean chance of landing a stun Q if she would otherwise need to go through the wave.\n\n>There's even more significant abuse cases that removing champion to minion collision creates. For example, the aforementioned Annie can just stand inside a minion wave to be safe from skill shots in general.\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/qRHotV9k-minion-ai-rules-documentation?comment=0002000000000000","replies":[{"poster":"Pale Pirate","date":"2016-08-29T11:43:53.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But unit collision used to be less annoying and these problems also didn't appear??","replies":[{"poster":"SociopathFriend","date":"2016-08-29T13:32:08.991+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is said a lot- but I can't help but wonder how much of it is smoke vs fire.\nEspecially when that same thread states minions really haven't changed.","replies":[{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2016-08-29T19:19:58.378+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unit collision has never been much of an issue.
