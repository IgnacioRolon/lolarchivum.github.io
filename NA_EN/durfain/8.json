Its their trademark for how you deal with them.\n\nYou really can not look at anyone and say with a straight face that Zed is weak in the early game, nor say that shoving him into the turret actually works. \n\nWhen you look at how he is not weak early game, coupled with the fact he isn't gated by nearly anything outside of shadow cool-downs, coupled with his ridiculous wave clear, its a recipe for a champion who is going to be infuriating. \n\nThe argument he falls off late game really doesn't work, I get that people say he falls off late game because his teamfight is terrible.\n\nWhich FYI, I do agree with, keep a Braum on backline carry, when Zed ults in a teamfight, he's gone, his team-fighting is objectively terrible. But team fighting isn't the only part of the game in late game. Split-pushing and making picks are also important at which he excels greatly at.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2016-04-21T20:12:27.871+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":20,"body":"It's no use.

That's only going to get worse with the itemization changes, which seem intentionally designed to prevent mages from using mana to push and waveclear.\nAlso, if you as a mage are pushing the lane, you are inviting a jungle gank and a Zed W+R on top of you.\n\n> Lol if Zed uses his spells to clear a wave go fucking kill his ass.\n\nZed CAN use his spells to waveclear (he can also easily last-hit minions to freeze the lane, throwing out Qs to harass or poke), but how can you go \"kill his ass\" when he has a W to disengage? He's very difficult to all-in unless your jungler is there with some CC.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LordOfTheLeague","date":"2016-04-21T19:16:49.220+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't even understand why Riot want mage to worry about mana when they are The Magic users.

You will never need to make decisions about mana again.","replies":[{"poster":"Durfain","date":"2016-04-21T19:49:08.406+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sure you can build to never worry about mana. I mean, tear will solve pretty much all your mana problems on most champions... but this update is hugely removing diversity. RoA is more of a tank item now (it only gives 400 mana anyways) and I can't see myself building it on most mid laners. Morellos is probably the \"de facto\" mana item now and it mixes elements of the old AuG and current morellos.. it's not terrible but by itself won't solve most champions mana issues. So you can opt for a big power spike or a much more permanent solution. Compare that to live where we have four viable options for resource generation.. RoA, Archangels, AuG and Morellos, you can go whichever of these suits your champion best or even more than one! I fail to see how limiting build diversity is good for the game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
