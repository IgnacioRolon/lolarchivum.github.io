Zhonya&#x27;s is a pretty crappy item on them.\n\nIf they know they are a priority target and the enemy has a fed Zed than they have to buy it. Because the active is just that sweet.\n\n> Meanwhile: Maw and Mercurial can always be built, Edge of Night if they don&#x27;t have low CD poke. Very few games have only physical or only magic damage, so there should always be defensive items for *either* side (there should be an ADC item that reduces ability damage tbh for enemy AD assassins)\n\nMaw and Mercurial are not always viable, period - but yes, you can always build them. You can also always build Zhonyas, but it's not always viable (not on every single champion atleast).\n\nAnd what about an AD assassin item that reduces physical damage?","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2016-12-04T00:31:18.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maw and mercurial are always viable against enemy magic damage - Zhonya's is dependent on the active so it doesn't work when the enemy physical damage is from an ADC or from an assassin that doesn't tunnel vision you. In exchange the active also works in situations not involving physical damage but IMO that detracts from the item's health as a situational anti physical damage item.\n\nYes there should be an anti physical damage item for assassins too. Tanky stats should be more accessible to squishy champions so they're not balanced around one shotting each other and doing sustained damage to tanks.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
