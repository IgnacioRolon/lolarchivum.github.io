Black Cleaver's armor shred goes before all percentage armor penetration. This wouldn't be a problem if weren't for the fact that Lord Dominik's Regards only penetrates bonus armor. Therefore, using both items together is counterproductive as Black Cleaver makes LDR's armor penetration LESS efficient.","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2016-08-26T14:10:01.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only if you look at it from an 'armor reduced' perspective. \n\nIf you calculate relative % damage increase, you aren't actually losing much by buying them together. The only situations where it would be truly counterproductive is if the Black Cleaver caused you to have more HP than the champions on the other team, or where Black Cleaver would reduce their bonus armor to 0 or less.\n\nIn the case of BC reducing their bonus armor to 0 or less, LDR is still a good buy if you can use its passive vs the majority of the enemy team.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bultz","date":"2016-08-26T13:07:06.212+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree with this, i build 300 to 400 amor and get melted by speed and 10% armor pen ffs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-08-26T11:37:13.434+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"or maybe an {{item:3742}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3068}} armor items that have hp with it. and if by lvl 18 if you are playing a champ that stacks armor you should have a base armor around 100 so if you have 300 armor with bouns armor meaing +200 bonus armor after the 62% reduction you are left with 176 armor 100 base and 38% bonus armor which is 76 (being if you had 200 bonus armor) and you are worried about needing that much armor items that have debuffs with armor would be ideal like {{item:3143}} {{item:3047}} which will reduce the amount of physical damage you take in addition to the armor and hp. {{item:3143}}  giving 10% damage reduction from crits and lowering attack speed by 15% from auto attacks and {{item:3047}} blocks 12% damage from basic attacks. thats alot of damage reduction passive plus the armor plus the hp.","replies":[{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2016-08-26T11:50:06.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I ALWAYS buy tabi or omen if I'm stacking armor.

My champ kits and masteries are the main focus for deciding my runes and items. If you haven't taken soraka top you should.
