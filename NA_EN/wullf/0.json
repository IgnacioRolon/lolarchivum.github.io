(did not find what is the lowest slow, but this will do)\nLets apply it here.\n\n325 - 225 = 100 (NURF buff)\n100 * 0,86 = 86 (Diana slow)\n86/2 = 43 (50% multiplication)\n110+43 = 153 (110 hardcap)\n\n14% slow gives 53 MS boost if your champion has 325 base MS.\nThat is stronger than Nami&#039;s passive.\n\nHow cool is that?\n\n(feel free to correct me if my thinking/execution is wrong)\n\n\nHere is my Space potato:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/LvGPAWw.png)\n\nEDIT1: 225 NURF reduction will probably be reduced by hardcap, therefore no speeding slows for us :(\nEDIT2: Updated space potato","replies":[{"poster":"Painted Celt","date":"2015-03-27T12:31:37.582+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":0,"body":"Clicked thread for space potato...

They have a *base* speed of 460.  However, this is over 415 soft cap, so it ends up being reduced to 451, the speed you see on their stats.  Old captain boots (nerfed for NO REASON) applied their haste to this 460 value, before being soft capped down again.\n\nIf NURF were real (or a special limited debuff that could be activated in a new mode), Ashe with no boosts would be at 160 thanks to the firm cap.  Apply a 90% slow to her *100* base (the actual stat is still 100 even tho she moves at 160), and you get 5, which results in 115.\n\n\nResult:  Slows do not haste, but the actual % change may differ from what you would expect.  Likewise, hastes are being applied onto a lower base than what you observe, so they will appear to have a small effect compared to their value.","replies":[{"poster":"Wullf","date":"2015-03-27T19:35:19.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you are probably right.\n\nMakes sense if I think about it more.\n\nThough idea of slow hastening was interesting-","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YOLO420SWAGSCOPE","date":"2015-03-27T16:02:12.576+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm pretty sure that they will just bring back URF in some variation (not this, this is not exactly what I call a variation) but even if they don't and stick to this I really think that it would open up some interesting strategic options\nMy guess for the number one OP pick in NURF would be Katarina (or any reset champion really)","replies":[{"poster":"Wullf","date":"2015-03-27T16:10:44.579+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"As I said, wheter or not is NURF real should not be part of the dissussion.\nBut I personaly I would love to play both URF and NURF","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JevelFaithful","date":"2015-03-30T18:28:49.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And...

Nearly unstoppable (with all the cooldown gating and aa damage reduction) and ccing you for incredibly long periods of time. Rammus would have an ms buff in q and a 4 second (with the anti-tenactiy) taunt. Cho'Gath would have feast, allowing him to gain large amounts of health. Sion, Nautilus. Every teamfight would be more or less a skirmish where 0 to 1 people die while the rest run away easily (unless you're willing to bust your flash (on a 10 minute cooldown if I remember correctly). Every thing has to be done *strategically* teleport down and not be able to for another 12 minutes? Or push and let the enemy slowly waddle over towards me? creep management are king, as ADCs can't clear waves as effectively and waveclear spells are heavily mana and cooldown gated. Ambush is necessary or otherwise, you won't catch up before they reach safety. It seems like bs to be forced into a tank (regardless of personal prference)  and not fight or use abilities, but endlessly strategize. I don't play league just to plan out every move ahead of time. I play to have fun. When I want extremely dense, long-winded planning I go to Starcraft and the like, not this MOBA. I play to actually deal damage with an asassin more often than five minutes when my ult is up, against the rare squishy target in this mode (Zed and others are near non-viable). In this mode, you play a tank or have no cc to fight back. {{summoner:1}}  may be a staple summoner, or stand still for long periods of time while you get slowly haltingly whittled down by enemies who slowly chase you. For me, someone who likes the fast paced nature of League more than he hates it, and like the quick decisions this game mode will be hell.\n Sure, I'll play to win. I'll play X tanky character with strong waveclear and watch/ read things about creep management and super waves. I'll push top instead of using my 12 minute teleport. I'll plan for contingencies. But it will be the most hellish, exhausting, mortifying, boring thing I've done, except in teamfights, where we chain cc people for up to 20 seconds with a strong comp, and never die then waddle around before going back to pushing objectives. \nThe fact is, if both teams are trying, and no one does something stupid like picking {{champion:92}} (no strong waveclear, needs cooldowns-shield necessary to survive damage with low hp regen, and aa dependent, well, at least she has a stun)  a game could last over an hour easily (waiting for minions to ramp up) and even further. It's a war of attrition. Hope the other team surrenders before you do from the sheer exhaustion/mental stress/boredom.\nSO. MUCH. FUN. STRATEGERY BOIS.\nOh yeah each team will need a hypercarry not dependent on crit and strong tank busters if you want the game to end faster than 60 minutes. Think-{{champion:67}}  or{{champion:96}} also, {{champion:22}} 's slow would once again (sorry Kalista, you move to slow for your jumping to be effective) be the ultimate \"eff you\" to melees, and she has good cc with that 3 minute ult, if she hits it.
