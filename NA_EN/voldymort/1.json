If I ban an ally's pick and play never-teamfight bot-lane farming Support Singed in one or two games that's one thing -- if I do it in *every* game with the intention of causing my team to tilt, that's a problem.\n\nConsider it like the chat restriction system. A bit of problematic behavior here and there is fine, but when it becomes a clear pattern of abuse there's an issue.\n\nAs Tantram said: _\"Playing off meta is not trolling or griefing.

When *every game* you're banning an ally's pick, when *every game* you're playing hilariously off-meta with no regards for your team, and when *every game* you're running from *every teamfight*, there's an issue, and one that Riot can identify as different from acceptable off-meta play.","replies":[{"poster":"Voldymort","date":"2018-10-15T14:01:59.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">Playing off meta, banning an ally's pick, etc. are all okay.

The difference is that if you cross into doing so antagonistically or for the *purpose* of burning bridges, there's a problem.\n\nMy personal process for playing off-meta (which I honestly love) is to tell my team what I'm going for up front.

It's a shitty countermeasure that generally just pisses the troll off and makes them troll worse, but it's an okay thing to do in principle if not very useful in practice.\n\n> I pick who I want to play. \n\nIf that's your attitude then play single player games, fuck off from any and all situations that require teamwork.\n\n> If you ban it, I pick who ever you want and lose because I can&#x27;t play that champ.  \n\nNo, by my experience you'd pick a worse champ out of being butthurt and feel justified to do so.\n\n> That is an absurd defense for you to ban my champ. You are defending a troll move that has no legitimate reason to exist.\n\nI just explained the legitimacy of it.\n\n> And yes if you ban me, get ready to be banned and trolled, if you think you need to ban me you should just dodge.

In any situation where you join a team of your own accord it is by default not okay to dirp and goof and troll. It's worse when you do and think you, for some reason, are entitled to do so.","replies":[{"poster":"Nubulas4","date":"2019-01-21T17:43:59.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your circular logic is amazingly stupid.\nYou assume I am trolling so then you justify any action on your part as if you are not the one instigating the conflict.\nYour judgement about what will work for me in my role is irrelevant.\nMost of the assholes that ban my champ also lose lane and then want to flame people in game.\n\nIt is stupid AF to ban a team mates pick.\n\nNow that bot lane is fuct by riot, everybody is playing anything bot, but there is always some douche bag in select who wants to be the select police.\n\nI have mentioned in select when I don't think a champ is best for a role and then they can change it if they want. \n\nIt is nothing more than arrogance for you to think you know my play and position better than I do.\n\nYou are every adc who wants me to play blitz and then flames the whole game because I'm not a blitz one trick.\n\nme \"Hey I got filled mid and I'm not good at mid, anyone want to swap?\"\n\n\"Learn how to mid.\"\n\nme \"ok\"\n\nloses mid hard no jungle help to some try hard Brand or Yasou....then the flaming begins.\n\nme filled in support, picks a champ\n\nyou : bans my champ...\n\nme: picks some other champ, bans your champ.\n\nyou.....starts the flaming....continues in game...we lose....you wanna blame me.\n\nLeague may have been designed as a team game, but I have rarely seen even 3 people on a team that will listen to simple direction or look at the map once or even respond to a ping.
