It's a classic attempt to deflect. You be the bully, call the other person a bully first to control the narrative. It just comes down to personal opinion I guess...

They are a huge abuser. And they are getting away with it because it's written in ToS - \"we are always right, even if proven wrong\". I find it unacceptable.\n\nSadly, taking a real slice of western society to prove any of that stuff is difficult.

Despair, sadness, but also anger and hatred towards the ones who offend you and you offend them back because you are hurt, stabbed. Or how everyone says it sarcastically, \"defend yourself\". Of course it isn't deffending yourself, it's simply an eye for an eye and the world goes blind...fighting fire with fire and down this world goes to ashes. I've been there, and I do agree with the origin post that such provokations are passive and shouldn't bother paying attention to people you'll see only once in your game and prolly never again. But do you have any idea, how it feels like to he one of THEM? They might be as toxic as everyone else in your eyes, but they are also sad and scarred, just like anyone who is aware that their actions have big consequences to pay, or people who are so mich covered in their arrogance they can't see what's coming to them.\nAs for emotionally unstable people...to them taking words into their heart is like getting emotionally backstabbed to death, not having the will not to say anything is like not having a shield...a shield that is tilt proof against the words of the likes of those jerks who have nothing better to do but bait THOSE type of emotional people into getting penalized. For them being the fish who took their bait.\nI get it that you'll say anything to prove me wrong, and everyone else too, wnd it's fine, opinions matter and differ.

They dont have responsibility, they dont have the hunger to achieve because they dont need to achieve anything. They often end up with major drug addictions because of their lack of responsibility. But to each their own. I dont think you should judge him based on his decision to do that. You dont know the right way anymore than anyone else. Its incredibly arrogant to refer to a man as \"that dumbass who...\" based on them not just giving their children money.
