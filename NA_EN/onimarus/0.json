From this point on, players will have to search for item boxes on the field and destroy them. For each destroyed item box, the person who last-hits it gets a random item for free, while the rest are able to purchase the item at a discount depending on how many assists/deaths you have. Every five minutes, the shop will also gain a new item to be purchased. \n\nThose who die to an enemy champion will have a random item stolen from them by the person who got the kill. A person who recently &quot;pillaged&quot; can&#039;t do so again for 10 minutes either. The goal remains the same overall: Kill the enemy nexus.\n\nFor kicks, toss in old items that no longer are available in-game too. I know a few people who would be delighted to get innervating locket again","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-10-27T17:37:57.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something less cool but more to the point (and more easy to develop): All Random All Mid W/ Random Items & No Shop. The Howling Abyss just isn't random enough. You'd have to buff the towers so players don't just plow through them in 5 minutes due to full itemization from the start, but other than that, it could work. I think it would probably still only last 10 minutes, but that's probably for the best. The random wukong trying to luden's people with his clone will probably giggle for a while, but let's be honest, he won't want to be stuck with the same crap items in the same game for too long. I think I can get a good 10 minutes of laughing from any random items I get.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blue Kaozi","date":"2015-10-27T14:35:46.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only issue I see is how snowbally this game would be.
