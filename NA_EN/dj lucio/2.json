I didn&#039;t mind, I bought Braum when he was on sale so I decided to play him. \r\n\r\nIt was so fun that I spam played him the rest of the night and plan on getting Santa Braum\r\nI even assisted my Jhin to get a pentakill, the first time i&#039;ve actually assisted a penta! I loved it, we were a duo and his reaction was priceless.\r\n\r\n\r\nSupport can be so fun! \r\nTahm, Braum, Blitz, Thresh, etc\r\n\r\nAre such fun champs and I love them\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t see why people dislike the class as they are some of the most fun champs i&#039;ve ever played.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2016-12-09T15:19:10.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because you rely on your team to do things, if they disagree and you do something you're gona have a bad time.","replies":[{"poster":"DJ Lucio","date":"2016-12-09T17:31:43.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, you rely on them to follow up","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-12-09T16:38:48.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think one reason is the responsibility to support.

If you play a damage champ like Brand, you feed yourself bot lane, and kill stuff that your team can't kill, and can actually hurt turrets with the AP you got (AP to magic damage autos vs turrets). \n\nThis gets even harder as you are supposed to give up even gold, making you even more weak, meaning you are neither tanky, nor have much AP, , making it hard to kill stuff on top of you being a champ that doesn't have the tools to do damage (Janna/Soraka/Taric type of supports).\n\nHowever, a support-ish playstyle does not have to be only bot lane. I've been playing Shen in a solo lane while building utility items, which, being cheap means I have 4 big items by the time people finish 2, and if I help my team to get ahead early, the lead usually won't fall off with me watching their back. It does feel rewarding when successful, I can tell you that.","replies":[{"poster":"MatthewRT2","date":"2016-12-09T15:39:02.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would politely disagree that taric can't take a turret, his passive gives him huge turret taking potential","replies":[{"poster":"Need Gold 4 Tent","date":"2016-12-09T16:18:21.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A little bit of AS doesn't really help unless you got the damage per hit to back it up, which you typically don't build unless you're either winning hard or not building support or both.

Maybe its bad luck for me but finding more than my fair share of marksman that feel the need to tell me what I have to play or ban the support I hover because they want something else kinda kills the 'want to help this guy' mood.
