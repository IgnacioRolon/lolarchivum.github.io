In lane, her Ulti also acts as an effective second flash that you have to try to burn for jungle ganks.\n\nShe has the mobility and burst of an assassin with the CC and Burst pattern of a Burst Mage. Even MORE so than Leblanc.\n\nGetting hit with 1 Charm means you are dead, which is fine on champs like Lux , Xerath etc who have to often risk positioning due to their immobility unless they see an opening, but Ahri usurps this weakness all together. \n\nThe first thing I would look into changing in her kit is her passive. it just feels like it is only there as a relic of the past and can make laning against her even more needlessly frustrating because what little harass you magically can get on her is erased just by her constantly harassing and running away with Q in lane.\n\nI personally would change it all together, but for the sake of small changes, lets make it need less stacks to heal her , but only stack when she hits an enemy champion.\n\nThe second is I want her Q to require she actually hit an enemy champion to get the MS.\nThis way, she is punishable if she misses and rewarded if she lands it.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2017-01-10T18:27:14.694+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":6,"body":"Man she does not have anywhere near the burst of LB ._. \n\nLB needs E-Q-W -ignite to kill someone taking only the time needed for E to activate. Ahri can only oneshot squishy under 80% granted that she hits everything and auto attacks.  And unlike lux,xerath or syndra her range is short (besides the slow E)  and all her spells besides Q can be blocked by minions. \n\nIf i were to rank them according to easy of play and strength i would not put Ahri high up. Because while she is safe from ganks at least she can't really impact teamfights without risking herself due to how her W and R find their targets.  And she is meant to be good in skirmishes and roaming! \n\nThat is why she is weaker than say syndra or orianna in lane, because she can roam and get kills better. This is why taliyah was so popular, the reliability and damage of Orianna with conditionally stronger roaming than Ahri. You and others here all see her for her strengths while ignoring obvious weaknesses.   And somehow people seem to think she has the burst of a syndra who was allowed to prepare which is also nonsense. \n\nIf she didn't have the Q movespeed then champs with long range poke would render her utterly useless, think about it! They can just poke from outside her range and she can't dodge. Because her base movementspeed is lowered in compensation for the speedup from Q.\n\nHowever i do agree, with both ultimate and Q she is extremely hard to interact with and it's quite hard to do anything unless she wants to. This is frustrating but due to how Riot changed her back in S3 i don't know what to change in order to make her a bit more accesable without making her OP or weak . She is already unpopular among  the pro players due to less burst than a assassin, shorter range than a normal mage and still as squishy along with the time needed to kill due to ultimate. And how difficult it is to impact teamfights like a normal mage would.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BasedNerd","date":"2017-01-10T17:38:51.743+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":4,"body":"I don't see what the problem is tbh.

This is similar to how old Zyra's 52%+ winrate was attributed solely to the few people with 125+ games. Ahri is a champion with a high amount of avg games played on her, so most of her stats will be from people who play her a significant amount.\n\nI've been everywhere between silver 4 and D4, I can tell you from experience that most people go from playing Ahri to syndra, lux, oriana and katarina because they have significantly more reliable carry potential. Also a huge aspect of carrying in higher elos is a source of an aoe nuke. Ahri is more of a single target assassin due to her q being the only aoe source of damage in her kit, and even that is pretty unnoticeable in a teamfight.\n\nAhri has pretty low base values, making her pretty item dependent. Other popular champions like syndra lux and katarina all have higher base values than normal champions, and they all scale really hard into the late game. Ahri tends to fall off once a mr item comes out from the other team. Ahri can only 100-0 another champion if she gets some good ap, it really seems like the people in this board are only talking about fed Ahri's when it comes to damage.\n\nQuit acting like Ahri is on the same tier as someone like vi, hecarim, kha, rengar, syndra, vayne or cait please, it is all too common for an Ahri to go something like 12-1 but not be able to win just because the other team picked better champions that Ahri cannot kill in 3 rotations of abilities.","replies":[]},{"poster":"angery pout","date":"2017-01-11T03:00:35.978+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahri is a champion who relies on mobility to survive and is actually killable unlike the brokens at the moment (POPPY.)\n\nThe only reason her winrate is high is because champs with high pick potential naturally have high winrates. Blitzcrank and Anivia are two other examples of that. Ahri's high playrate is due to her being a fan favorite just like Yasuo (who is also a hard counter to Ahri.) The only time she was ever actually broken and could 100 to 0 you without using her full rotation was with her old charm and DFG.\n\nShe does not explicitly counter any champions other than immobiles (mostly ADCs, but also melees such as Darius and Garen who are easily kited,) but she is easily countered in a 1v1 situation by any champion with point and click burst, the ability to outplay/otherwise mitigate her charm, negate her mobility (cancelling dashes with displacement, Poppy W, apply slows during her Q animation.)\n\nHer only targeted abillities are her W (locks onto the closest target) and her R (requires her to dash in rather than use her to use it to reposition for the return of Q, etc.) Before complaining about multiple dashes. A single projectile from one charge of Spirit Rush has a 30% AP ratio. Using all 3 to kill someone leaves her vulnerable to being turned on by their allies.\n\n**TLDR:** Has high WR due to pick potential, which can win games even if they individual performed poorly earlier in the game. Her kit is easily outplayed by dodging 1 ability (charm) that enables the rest of her kit. If she uses 3 charges of Spirit Rush to run you down, she leaves herself vulnerable and without escape. She counters easily kited champions and champions with no way around her charm, mostly ADCs like Ashe. She is countered by point and click burst (no outplay from her) and anything that can nullify her charm.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bronze Bonanza","date":"2017-01-10T16:37:49.562+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":6,"body":"I could never figure out why they added the speedboost on her Q.

Rather than changing her back into a kill mage with mobility like any other number of champions like Kassadin, Ekko, LB, etc.  I would rather see her solidified as a kite mage with more emphasis on shoving in a wave then roaming to other lanes like Talon rather than bursting people by Ult + E'ing into their face, which wouldn't change even with Q movespeed nerfs.

Ahri does decently here due to her decent waveclear which she needs to roam.  \n\nKilling:  Killing your lane opponent, currently a good solid option for Ahri due to her ability to sustain through harass that her opponent can followed by ulting into their face with a strong all in.\n\nRoaming:  What Ahri's movespeed is built to do as well as kiting in fights.  This is the direction Riot tried to push Ahri (Partially succeeding) and the direction I as an Ahri player think she should be pushed into as there aren't a lot of roaming mages.\n\nCurrently Ahri is decent to strong at all 3 of those, and due to her passive and a forbidden codex it is very difficult to push her out of lane without going oom or taking too much harass in return.  As part of roaming she needs waveclear so she can push in then gank other lanes.  That means that if she has to take a hit somewhere it needs to be at her laning power.  That being said a small E nerf (soemthing like +2 seconds scaling down to normal at rank 5) or a passive nerf against her sustain is what she would probably need more than a damage nerf.\n\nThis is my input as an Ahri player myself.","replies":[{"poster":"SpongebobIsLife","date":"2017-01-10T20:44:49.849+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"i just don't think shes strong enough to the point where nerfs are warranted.
