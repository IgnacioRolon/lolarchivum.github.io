I use to get around low 60 now it is high ~87. I was hoping the issue would go away on its own but it has not. I do work in the IT field so I have tried troubleshooting my end and things seem fine.\r\n\r\nI have tried 3 different computers. 1 wired through router, 1 wired to buildings router, 1 wireless to my router. All 3 have roughly the same ping ~87\r\n\r\nI have ran an MTR test and I see 3 possible issues and one of them looks to be a hop from 104.160.138.35 - 104.160.131.1. I am seeing ~20 ms jump at this hop which seems odd. \r\n\r\nMTR Log:\r\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n\r\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\r\n\r\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\r\n\r\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\r\n\r\n|                           RT-AC88U-9EC8 -    0 |  928 |  928 |    0 |    0 |    2 |    0 |\r\n\r\n|          ics152-225.icsincorporated.com -    0 |  928 |  928 |    0 |    0 |    1 |    0 |\r\n\r\n|                             10.243.20.1 -    0 |  928 |  928 |    0 |    0 |    3 |    0 |\r\n\r\n|                           10.136.243.21 -    0 |  928 |  928 |    2 |    7 |  360 |    2 |\r\n\r\n|    ins-db1-et-11-4-3011.desm.netins.net -    0 |  928 |  928 |    4 |    4 |   15 |    4 |\r\n\r\n|            ins-kc2-po20.kmrr.netins.net -    0 |  928 |  928 |    5 |    6 |   11 |    6 |\r\n\r\n|               10ge7-3.core1.oma1.he.net -    0 |  928 |  928 |   30 |   32 |   43 |   30 |\r\n\r\n|              10ge3-11.core1.den1.he.net -    0 |  928 |  928 |   21 |   26 |   75 |   22 |\r\n\r\n|                   No response from host -  100 |  186 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\r\n\r\n|                          104.160.138.35 -    1 |  920 |  918 |   57 |   57 |   82 |   57 |\r\n\r\n|          ae34-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    1 |  924 |  923 |   77 |   77 |   93 |   91 |\r\n\r\n|                           104.160.131.1 -    1 |  924 |  923 |   76 |   76 |   87 |   76 |\r\n\r\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|","replies":[{"poster":"Darrko","date":"2017-04-27T10:10:44.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have the sam problem the last 2 days.

I recommend reaching out to your ISP and sharing your log so they can investigate those hops.  Specifically, 10.136.243.21 is the most screwed.  Hopefully, they'll be able to check it out and fix it up.  \n\nIn the meantime, you could try changing how you're routing by configuring your DNS (with steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide).  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
