I haven't bee able to play for a week because of the same issue. After champion select I am in a black screen that never loads into game even though I can hear game sounds. The game continues to freeze every couple of seconds. One thing I don't see other people mention is that it seems to freeze on the first frame that I joined. (e.g. when i join i am standing in base. I start walking down lane. After a few seconds it snaps back to showing my character in base and is frozen) When I tab out and back in i see my character correctly standing under tower where I had originally directed him. Freezing pattern begins a few seconds later and repeat :(\n\nI see that the full screen announcement is gone in the client but nothing has been fixed for me either.","replies":[]},{"poster":"radubx","date":"2017-01-18T10:29:54.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is still not working. pls do somethink.","replies":[]}]}
