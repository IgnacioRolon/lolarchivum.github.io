I havent played ranked in a while, been moving around alot recently (touring) \r\nand this just completly kills the vibe.\r\n\r\nI also cant understand why, if i cant remember a detail like in which order my refund purchases were, that Riot says &quot;your answer is invalid&quot; \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat should i do? \r\nSemi freaking out atm.","replies":[]}
