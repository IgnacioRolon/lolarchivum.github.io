However, I quickly realized that it&#039;s practically impossible to play him in my games. Every game, there is an Akali, Zed, Yasuo, Irelia, Kayn, and other champions with high mobility and burst. Even if they are bad, they can dodge all my skillshots by simply using their dashes, and the ability cast times for Vel&#039;Koz are very slow. His only real cc is his E, a knockup, and if they sidestep its minuscule AoE, then you just die. \r\n\r\nI have had some better luck with him as a support because you don&#039;t take farm from other people but can still do good damage. But again, as everyone plays Alistar, Pyke, thresh or Blitz, it&#039;s hardly viable. Being good at Vel&#039;Koz requires a lot of effort, but the return is really low compared to fotm champs.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I find the meta is too unkind for this purple boi, and I fee like I just wasted my blue essence buying an unviable champ. \r\n\r\nThanks for attending my TED talk.","replies":[]}
