Most of the time when people start being toxic, I just mute them and continue playing. Because they are muted, I don&#039;t see any further toxicity and often forget to report them afterwards when I leave the post game lobby. \n\nThis happened today, as well. I had an unpleasant interaction and muted the player at the very start. Later, I forgot to report, but I now I wonder if I should send a ticket to Riot support? I have heard that Riot has zero-tolerance policy towards things like &quot;kill yourself&quot;, and I think this comes very close. Besides, I have not reported so many douchebags that maybe I am doing a disservice to the community. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/aCvDUsa.png\n\nPS: And just for the record, my in-game name is just a song name, so I am not looking to start any political or philosophical debates on the topic. :D","replies":[]}
