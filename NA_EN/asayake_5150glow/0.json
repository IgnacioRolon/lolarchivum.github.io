Then I closed it, and opened it again. Black screen. Then \"Failed to authenticate\". Restarted my computer, took me a couple tries to log in. Bigger black screen. I alt tab, it says there's a problem with my internet. I hit retry. This happens three more times, then it puts me to the post game screen, with my team having remade, with me as the leaver.\r\n\r\nMy internet works fine. It worked an hour ago, it works now, it'll work when I play another game. So, tell me, what in hell just happened?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-04T01:53:15.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like for some reason your network is having a hard time talking with the game server specifically.
