Your shading is pretty great, and the wand/dress is pretty neat! Very pretty!\n\nBut now, time for the *—kra-ka-thoom—* criticism part. As weird as this sounds, the bottom half is great. The feet could use some practice (just ask any artist ever about the icky hands and feet), but everything between that and the waist is decent (including the dress). I see you trying to cheat with the other leg hiding behind the first, but try to avoid that. The back foot looks odd and there's no shading in the left section of the back leg that is shown. For the future, try a wider stance to practice proportions (such as raising a knee, or a crouch for instance).\n\nNow, time for the upper body. Considering Lux's... age, proportions for the most part are fine. Not every girl has an impossible hourglass figure, so kudos for not trying to do that. Shoulders look okay, and the beginning of the neck looks alright. Her left arm could use some work, but good job not hiding it like the leg (don't worry, this takes practice. You're doing fine so far). As for the right arm, the elbow is basically nonexistent and the wrist is not accentuated like it should be (either make it a tad slender, or make her hands a little bigger/wider). \n\nNow, for the head. Don't worry, back when I was drawing for a hobby (I'm terrible, I'm much more of a writer, but I practiced the visual stuff to connect to my artist friends a little better so we could relate) I understood how much of a pain it is. Fortunately, I did learn some things that can help you.\n\nGive the hair volume. Think about how thick hair is, and how poofy it gets, and go from there. Hair doesn't like flat on someone's head (unless it really is that short and/or straight). Otherwise the shading and design of the hair is really pretty.\n\nI don't think I should really talk about the face/eyes, because we ALL know how much of a pain that is! That takes practice, and nothing I can say here would magically (sorry) help you! Practice practice practice!\n\n.\n\nI know that had a lot more criticism than praise, but... well, I cared. It's really adorable, and it compelled me to speak out and see if I could do something to help. \n\nArt Rating: 7/10 \nCuteness Rating: Somewhere between that moment in the movie where Sayaka and Kyoko held hands and basically every scene with Charlotte ever.

Or is it Meguka now?\n\nDamn, when I asked for a critique, I imagined it would be a few sentences to a paragraph, but I just really want to thank you for taking the time to review this and critique very fairly. I completely agree with you on pretty much all the topics (this is what happens when I finish sketching and coloring a drawing in one day, but I couldn't help myself since the skin is so darn adorable) and I will refer to this for future works. Again, I really appreciate it and have a great day you wonderful person you! :D","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-05-02T09:16:00.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keep it up!
