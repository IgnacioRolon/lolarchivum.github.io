Nothing was changed on my part that would of made this happen but I keep disconnecting randomly from my game constantly and its happening frequently where I can't play a game. My fps won't change or anything, same for my ping but, I know I disconnect because no damage will be registering and I'm kinda just floating around the map. Also when I do reconnect no champs shows on the mini map or my screen and ill just disconnect right back again. Actually happening while I type this and I've tried leaving and reconnecting, no luck as I can't even play the game. Probably dc'd around 10 times now with no luck reconnecting where I can actually play.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-21T22:06:03.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes your network can just have a hard time getting connected to specific servers.
