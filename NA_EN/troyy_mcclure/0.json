After that, both the client and game have been choppy. At first, I got the inability to load the game after lobby, so i might be related to the client issue Riot is broadcasting. \r\n\r\nThe choppiness means that game accepts, character trades are lagged. Sometimes my rune pages show up as blank in champ select and the drop down menu for rune pages won't populate. Worst is in-game the refresh rate is terrible, with champions showing up other places. The action catches up at second or two later but never consistently. I have high FPS and 65ms for NA. I haven't had these issues, even this week. It started after the minor update last night.\r\n\r\nThoughts? Fixes?","replies":[{"poster":"Roostter","date":"2017-03-09T22:14:56.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same problem and i already changed all the specs to very low and the resolution to HD when my computer allows FHD but it continues to do the same particularly when in fight.\nIs really frustrating and it's getting harder to play LoL\nI have an i7 Processor with a dedicated 2GB nvidia and 12Gb RAM","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-04T19:55:50.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Issues like connecting to game or not being able to select masteries/runes suggest an unstable connection.
