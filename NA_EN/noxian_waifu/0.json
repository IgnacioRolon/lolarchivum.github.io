Instead of Taliyah riding the wave, she rides a broom stick\r\n\r\nWhat I had in mind with this rough draft was maybe she's the student of all the current witches (Trist, Morg, Janna, etc.) learning the ways of becoming a witch. Every lesson completed she earns a charm from each teacher (the little charms on her cape) and eventually her own hat that will ~~hopefully~~ fit her once she passes all the tests.\r\n\r\nI'd love some feedback on the outfit because I was a little lost lol","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2019-10-15T22:25:37.735+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your vision for all the new spell effects and themes are super fun and flavorful!\n\nMaybe she can ride the broom whenever her wall-riding passive kicks in?","replies":[{"poster":"Noxian Waifu","date":"2019-10-16T01:57:58.359+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone on Twitter suggested her Q is a hex and it's like a fire. Definitely gonna try it out whenever I get to make a full concept!\n\nAnd that would be super cute! Gives her more use of the broom stick other than just her ult","replies":[]}]}]}
