I didn't know what it was, but assumed it was a skin. Wat. I got Nurse Akali, and I know for a FACT I never bought this, because I bought Crimson Akali during the short  period of her being re-released. Akali has the second most mastery points out of all of my champions. I have French Maid Nidalee (my highest) Riot, what was this for? I took part in the Alpha Client. I'm really lost - Nurse Akali doesn't even show up in my shop history. (kinda irrelevant, but I would have preferred Frejlord Taliyah :P) So, can anyone from riot confirm why or how this happened? Thank you,\r\n\r\n~Seal","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-07T19:30:34.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see that you have Nurse Akali, but it was obtained back in September.
