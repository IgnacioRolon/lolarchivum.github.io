But having the philosophy that reporting someone that isn't actually breaking the code is the right thing to do is pretty dumb when there's even a red post clearly indicating that surrender is not the same as assisting the enemy team.\n\nIf anything it's pretty selfish, as if your team isn't in the mindset to fight on, you're better off ending that game before the players become even more frustrated. Why?  Because those frustrated players are likely to become the next trolls, feeders, etc.  So by your frame of mind, You are in fact assisting the enemy teams of future games by upsetting your teammates so much that they're likely to take it out on other people.\n\nPeople prefer to win than lose, but when one side is clearly dominating the other it's generally better to save that fighting spirit for the next match instead of killing it off completely.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Speedkat","date":"2013-10-07T19:56:52.164+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm gonna have to take issue with your statistic there.

I do. And per my statement you're quoting, I *have* on occasion won 4v5 games. Why? Because my team never gave up.\n\nBut nobody is making you vote 'yes' on a surrender. If you want to follow this mentality, then just always vote 'no' for surrenders. \n\nBut to jump all the way to 'surrendering is toxic' is just too far. We even saw it happening at the pro level during Worlds. Sometimes you just need to get out of a game, regroup, and start again fresh.\n\nAnd it *still* doesn't nullify my previous statements about the system ignoring your reports. Because it *will* do this over time. And then when you do run into that player who is actually toxic, your report won't mean anything there, either.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cozarkian","date":"2013-10-17T19:48:32.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't think you understand.

The issue that comes in is the the other four people had to be in agreement for the game to be surrendered since it has to be 4 of 5 votes to surrender.  League is very much a game based on perception, and if four of the five people believe that the game is unable to be won than in most scenarios the game will be lost based on that perception.  Those four people will not be able to play well enough to win the game from that point on and everyone on your team would get more frustrated which could lead to more toxicity in game and punishable offences.  So while I agree that surrender should not always be an option, if four out of five people agree to it just be happy that you didn't want to quit and go into your next game with that try hard attitude.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Abyss Gear Syxx","date":"2013-10-12T06:26:45.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"This post is feasible if you add three words \"Only In Ranked\" otherwise you are being hardcore about things that have no impact.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elfan","date":"2015-01-05T00:18:56.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I also report people who continually start surrender votes, but for \"Negative Attitude\".
