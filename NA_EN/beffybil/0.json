I've had so many ban timer recently and none are my fault that I'm about to quit league. because it took a whole 3 mins to restart my computer, plus an extra min to restart the game after YOUR systems failure. A. for being gone for that short of a time I should be getting a ban. and B. it's partly YOUR fault.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-11T21:18:01.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With your example, you are completely right.  We never punish a player for leaving a single game because we know that frankly, shit happens.  Pool on fire, cat on fire, grandma on fire, something always catches on fire forcing you away from your computer.\n\nHowever, you have either AFK'd or DC'd in 15 separate games in the last 30 days alone.  Given the consistency, penalties were levied against your account.  That being said, we can definitely help resolve any technical issues you are experiencing to make sure this doesn't happen again!  Other than the BSOD, are there other technical issues that keep happening?","replies":[{"poster":"Dechozen101","date":"2016-05-12T00:03:28.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HELP, MY FIRE \n\nIS ON FIRE\n\nAHHHH\n\nSorry guys, 15th time this month.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"beffybil","date":"2016-05-11T20:50:05.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im frustrated at this because ya sure it ruins game play for others, but it's not are fault.  Y should I be being punished for something that I can't do anything about, that y I gave the idea of tracking ping and stuff (yes I realize it would help this situation at all) but for my other 2 ban timers before this it would of help out a lot, and when u only have a small amount of time to play, I don't have the chance to deal with the timer.\n\nAnd now not only am I frustrated at your system but also at you Dartagnan because I didn't leave the game my game crashed, and then Your system glitched making me have to reload my game, an I clearly already understood y u have ban timers and who it affects, but u are unjustly punishing people who are the victims not the guilty.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-11T00:59:10.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely get where you are coming from.  These issues do seem completely out of your control, but at the end of the day, you leaving the game is ruining the gaming experience of up to 9 other players.  It is for this reason that we put in penalties/suspensions for leaving.  Because of this, I can't reduce your penalties at all :(\n\nAre you still experiencing these issues however?  If so I should be able to respond with some troubleshooting steps that should help out!","replies":[]}]}
