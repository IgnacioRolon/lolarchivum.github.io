Taliyah for example is a Shuriman (raised around goat herders) who has been to the Freljord, Ionia, and has been around Noxians. She is able to communicate with them. Either she is a fast learner, or somehow, they all speak the same language. Then there&#039;s Demacia, where being an isolated nation, I&#039;m surprised they don&#039;t have their own language.\r\n\r\nMoving forward with the lore, this is starting to eat at me more.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-02-27T23:13:22.785+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is something I'm super-passionate about. Back when Ornn was released, we talked a lot about the \"ancient Freljordian\" language that was created for 'The Path to Hearth-Home' teaser song, and I'm always trying to find ways to do more of that kind of thing.\n\nIt's probably safe to assume that a lot of nations across Runeterra speak a common tongue, or that they at least understand one another. It's important not to assume anything... but that would lead me to question, where did that common language come from? It has interesting implications for the lore. :-)\n\nIn a real-world sense, speaking from 10+ years in publishing and novels, if a story features only characters speaking their native language but it is intended for an audience who don't speak that language, you just do it in the language of the audience. I'm thinking of the TV show 'Versailles', which is mostly French characters, almost all speaking French... but the show is in English. That's just suspension of disbelief, for ease of consumption.\n\n'Vikings' is a great example of messing with that idea for the purposes of dramatic storytelling. When you have only Viking characters speaking their language, it is presented in (Nordic-accented!) modern English. The first time we see English monks, they speak Old English and Latin, but then transition into modern English as we get to know a couple of characters in particular. HOWEVER, when a scene is from the POV of the Vikings and other characters are speaking Old English (and vice versa) things start to get interesting!\n\nThe TL;DR is, basically, you can use language, and language barriers, to serve the needs of your story. Otherwise, just find a way for there to be a common tongue, and lean into that.\n\nGreat question, though!","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2018-02-28T01:51:50.878+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everything that has been showed so far tends to push in the direction of many very distinct languages. Y'all created many different languages, with obviously different roots, different grammars, etc., for Shurima, Freljord, Serpent Isles and Ionia. Yet, in the stories, people from those different regions met and had no difficulties understanding each others. So, do they have a *lingua franca* in common, different from their respective native tongues, but that was somehow never mentioned up until now?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-03-01T03:58:38.451+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup!

Karma is a really good example of how that can be done in-game, as her ancient Ionian dialect evokes a sense of power and authority whenever she uses her ult. Likewise, it would be cool to see other important Ionians refer to this language as they are deeply rooted in their ancestral tradition. \n\nFiora might be another good example of how Demacia, being very isolationist as a nation, has their own language. Perhaps some of the older noble houses speak something that ressembles French? \n\nOther fantasy universes have used this to great effect. Avatar (James Cameron), Star Wars, Star Trek, Witcher, Dragon Age, LotR... language is an incredibly powerful narrative medium that I think isn't used nearly as much as it should in LoL, which is a damn shame because it's one hell of a way to cement a universes' overall lore.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-03-01T22:44:01.546+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I...

The idea of there being languages that are wide spread is a good idea. I mean on Earth there are examples of this; Mandarin (both native and secondary) is spoken by 14% of the population, Spanish by 5.8% and English by 5.5%. \n\nHowever, I REALLY want to caution against pushing this idea to far. If language on Runeterra becomes too homogenous, you run into the problem of making the world seem too small and unrealistic. I get that Runeterra is a fantasy world, and that there has to be some simplification in building the world and I would be fine with the most common language (Ur-Noxian I'm guessing) being spoken by AT MOST 30-35% (ideally around 20%). I could even swallow, although toughly, 35 - 45% of Runeterrans speaking the same language. I think 50% or greater would ruin my immersion in Runeterra though.\n\nHaving said that, I do sympathize with the impossible large task of world building Runeterra. However, I suggest consulting with historical linguists, evolutionary anthropologists and academics of similar/relevant fields to create, in very broad strokes, human evolution on Runeterra. I think once you got that, making languages and deciding who speaks what will be more manageable. I think this is something that you guys have already done with the Vastayans and if you haven't already, I think it would be really helpful in developing the human languages as well. For instance, by knowing where and when humans migrated you can discern \"Ok, so these humans migrated from here 5,000 years ago and split of to here, there and there etc.\" and you can start saying in broad terms \"Shuriman shares roots with Icathian which are both wildly different from Ionian which has regional dialects in x,y,z etc.\" *I will elaborate on this later*\n\nOne last point I wanted to touch on is in regards to the second part of your comment:\n\n> In a real-world sense, speaking from 10+ years in publishing and novels, if a story features only characters speaking their native language but it is intended for an audience who don't speak that language, you just do it in the language of the audience. I'm thinking of the TV show 'Versailles', which is mostly French characters, almost all speaking French... but the show is in English. That's just suspension of disbelief, for ease of consumption.\n\n'Vikings' is a great example of messing with that idea for the purposes of dramatic storytelling. When you have only Viking characters speaking their language, it is presented in (Nordic-accented!) modern English. The first time we see English monks, they speak Old English and Latin, but then transition into modern English as we get to know a couple of characters in particular. HOWEVER, when a scene is from the POV of the Vikings and other characters are speaking Old English (and vice versa) things start to get interesting!\n\nThis is something I've also been interested in, which I've referred to as \"4th Wall Translation\". This is not an actual term (I think it should be :P), but I think it fits what you're describing. As you stated, in Vikings or Last Kingdom for example, they're speaking the Nordic languages that they spoke back then, but the 4th Wall is \"translating\" that to modern English for modern English speaking audiences. Likewise, the Spanish/French/Mandarin etc. dubs are translating those old Nordic language to modern Spanish/French/Mandarin etc. for audiences of those languages. Similarly, using different fonts or colouring in comics to represent different languages is a \"4th wall translation\". \n\nHaving said that, I think using 4th wall translations could be really beneficial for Riot. \n\nFirstly, it partially alleviates the gargantuan task of world building and creating many different con-langs. For instance, if you have a linguistic \"roadmap\" of sorts (as described earlier) you can know which character speaks what despite the fact that they're \"speaking\" English (or whatever language based on the server) in game, in client and in lore. From there, you can decide (from a business resource allocation perspective and creative decision making perspective): When should we put effort into developing con-langs? Which region in Runterra  would it be most beneficial to flesh out a con-langs for? When is it appropriate to use con-langs instead of the 4th wall translation in stories? etc. \n\nSecondly, it provides potential for interesting storytelling. For instance, say you guys make a comic of Taliyah first meeting Yasuo. Her font would be different from Yasuo's and as Taliyah begins learning Ionian, her font would begin to match Yasuo's. This would be a good way to create immersion and indicate to the audience that these two characters speak two different non-Earth languages, without being impractical for the audience to read and without having to spend hours on hours fulling fleshing out both Shuriman and Ionian just for one scene of dialogue.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-03-01T03:51:44.708+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a really interesting concept! I love the term \"4th wall translation\", too. :-)\n\nI'm always in favour of finding real-world precedent and making things as authentic as possible. But a great quote from my former boss at Games Workshop, when trying to deal with changes to an existing setting, was **'Does it actually matter? And is the new thing cool?'** In a lot of cases, for the kinds of stories we need to tell in Runeterra, this won't be super important for a while - the rule of cool will dominate, until such time as it needs to be given more depth and authenticity. I mean, heck, a lot of players just want champions to either fight or kiss, and don't really care about the level of realism in those encounters! :-P\n\nSomething I also like in prose fiction is using italics to show where a language is being used deceptively, or confusingly. Here's an example:\n===\n\n\"Give us two shots of your finest whisky,\" Steve said to the bartender. \"In clean glasses.\"\n\nJeff watched, unimpressed, as the old man poured their drinks. _\"I guarantee it'll be watered down...\"_ he muttered in his native tongue.\n\n===\nYou can get away with a lot, just using italics to separate out the text. It removes a barrier to the reader who only speaks English, and who doesn't need to actually read in the other language, whatever it is. In a movie, you'd get subtitles for those lines!\n\nThe other option could be:\n===\n\n\"Give us two shots of your finest whisky,\" Steve said to the bartender. \"In clean glasses.\"\n\nJeff watched, unimpressed, as the old man poured their drinks. _\"Bah boo bee boop...\"_ he muttered.\n\n===\nBut then you'd have to explain what \"Bah boo bee boop\" means, either contextually by the way Steve reacts, or by literally throwing in a translation afterwards. ;-)\n\nIn previous League fiction, it's either been this latter approach (like Xayah and Rakan's dialect terms) or by just having everyone speak the same language.\n\nAnyway, I'm rambling! Basically, I agree with a lot of what you said, and it's something I'm keen to develop in future. :-)","replies":[{"poster":"Star Guardían","date":"2018-03-01T05:40:20.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply, I really appreciate it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2018-02-28T01:41:54.002+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A barrier between Ionia and the rest of the world, Ionia being a (somewhat) isolated Island nation and all that.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-03-01T03:35:57.598+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can imagine, since the invasion by Noxus and subsequent abandonment of the war by Swain, that Ionians have learned to speak more of whatever language the Noxians speak?
