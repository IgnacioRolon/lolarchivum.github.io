One of the champions mentioned is Mundo. In lore, Mundo is a sociopath. He kills puppies, and experiments on people. While his experiments have changed his body and mind, he still essentially does the same things he did before. In game however, he seems to be more of a goofball, an almost lovable goofball by fans. \r\n\r\nNow, if Riot were to ever change Mundo, how should he be? A serious, crazed monster, a goofball who doesn&#039;t quite understand how to interact with people, or a mix of both? Personally, I can see Mundo as someone who loves his work. That&#039;s a defining trait for Zaun, they love their work, they just don&#039;t care who they have to hurt to get their way. Mundo experimented on himself, so I don&#039;t think he&#039;s a pure sadist. Sadomasochist is more accurate. He might even like the people he&#039;s hurting. Maybe he&#039;s just curious about them? \r\n\r\nI&#039;m once again afraid that talking about story ideas, even if we&#039;re talking about their personas, may result in Riot refusing to work with it due to fan-fiction, but what are your perceptions about certain characters? Do you feel they match up with either the lore or their in-game portrayal? What about how other fans feel about them? Do people seriously consider Teemo to be Satan? Should the lore be changed to match our views or in-game versions? Should champions in-game be changed to match the lore and we change our views accordingly? Is there a compromise between these sides?","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-05-17T16:42:44.486+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mundo is happy all the time in the game because he gets to make both people and himself bleed there on the front line, given his nature.\n\nAlso the reason why he generally behaves and acts like that is due to his own physical enhancement drug that he has been overdosing over the years, which greatly handicaps his intelligence as a side effect.\n\nHe just hasn't lost all senses of self yet, seeing him actually acknowledging his own mental deformation and deconstructionism.

Unless I am misunderstanding where those players are coming from.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2015-05-18T23:01:35.915+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No you're right, he was always a jerk.
