I think we'll mainly see Akali going through like a coming of age journey narratively.

It sounds like shes no longer with the Kinkou and striking out on her own all anime protagonist style.

Maybe a Kennen update? A Syndra update? Depends I suppose on what they would want to do update wise. I feel like a Syndra update'd be more likely than a Kennen one, just cuz Kennen's got the whole \"yordle\" thing dangling over him and Riot continues to avoid that unless necessary, and if they were ever gonna update the darker Ionians lore, Akali'd probably be the easiest way of doing so. \n\nIf I'm being optimistic, I'd hope for lore updates for Kennen, Syndra and Zed, along with a short story of sorts.\n\nBeing pessimistic, I'd expect Akali to get a full bio, new colour story and that's about it.\n\nIf I'm being realistic, I'd expect Akali to get a full bio, new colour story, a cinematic like they seemingly like to do with all the VGUs now, though potentially more stylised like Irelia's, and a Zed bio update.\n\nI'm somewhere between realistic and optimistic at present.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crow Nebula","date":"2018-07-01T10:56:29.382+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":10,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Birdie","date":"2018-07-01T14:15:27.936+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Congrats.
