If Xayah and Rakan are the moon and sun, and Cosmic Yi, shooting stars, the biggest and baddest Cosmic skin may end up an entire universe in himself.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2017-04-21T07:49:58.995+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Entire Universe Karthus?

Technically Acolyte Lee Sin is a lore skin, and Jailbreak Graves was supposed to be when he broke out of prison - although at the time the lore was so vague the idea that he was breaking out of some Fortress-esque space prison was fine while now it seems really out of place. I _believe_ Spell Thief Lux was originally based on her pre-release lore, when her Prismatic Barrier stealthed the friendly champions it hit (which makes much more sense for a light mage than temporary hp) and the story was she would use her stealth to steal spells. But as you said with Blood Moon, it's all very vague now.\n\nHaving said that Rioters on foundations and champion teams are always keen to suggest lore-based skins so I am sure we'll see more in the future. I think it would be cool if we had some kind of watermark or stamp that indicated lore skins (and maybe even 'universe' identifiers).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Riot 10YearSanta","date":"2017-04-24T20:27:42.864+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kindlejack,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=1MdafUqZ,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-04-20T16:59:18.145+0000)\n>\n> When we arrived at the idea of doing some more Cosmic skins, which happened quite organically around the Xaya/Rakan launch skins, we talked about them representing wondrous gods/beings that tribes tell stories about as they look up at the constellations in the night sky.

Being humble and open to learning new things, trusting others and admitting to mistakes are really vital to success in this field, and he really inspires me to do more of that.\n\nI wonder what he would make of League? As I mentioned earlier there are definitely a lot of overlaps and things we can learn from their successes and mistakes over the years. Another thing that wasn't on my previous list that I think also applies is new player experience and how to introduce people into what is a very punishing and complex game system. What I found really interesting about MtG is that over the years they've tried a multitude of entry level products and initiatives but inevitably most new players get taught by their friends - in the deep end. It makes sense when you think about gamers though, who are intelligent people that are always looking for challenges. It's no wonder they'd rather jump right in with their friends than ramp up with basic products. It still raises the question of how do you get into a game like MtG or LoL without having a friend to help you, and without boring baby steps?","replies":[{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2017-04-22T08:56:27.597+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, I've seen it happen with tabletop RPGs: D&D does a very bad job at teaching you how to play it, you can't just throw three 300-pages manuals at a new player and tell him to read them.\nI'm not very knowledgeable in CCGs, but as far as RPGs go there have been a lot of steps foreward to improving some inherent problems: games with no prep (or even no DM), games where you read the manual and learn the rules while playing (Mechs vs Minions comes to my mind here, too!), games with rules that support and encourage drama and character interaction rather than simulation of a real world.\n\nVideo Games have had tutorials ever since, and in this regard I think League has a lot of examples to take ideas from, MtG needed to rely more exploration and experimentation","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2017-04-26T18:20:58.980+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think that's one of the things I love about Acquisitions Inc. and it's ilk - sometimes the best way to learn is by watching someone do it well.
