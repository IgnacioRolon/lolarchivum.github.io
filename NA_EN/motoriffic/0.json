Especially if you left windows update on, all sorts of stuff gets fucked up by it.\n\nNot to mention 'a few thousand dollars of hardware' sounds like a pretty badly planned system and could well have some instabilities going on, unless it is primarily a rendering workstation or such.\n\nPlus you have no control over your WAN connection. Have you checked the game and router logs (if you dont have router logs, run firmware that is not shit)?","replies":[{"poster":"Motoriffic","date":"2018-06-16T02:15:47.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I run Google Wifi with Mesh routing. Firmware is up-to-date. I have zero problems with anything else and had zero problems until the second it patched the hot fix.  Many people are having this issue. It's not just me guy. And no its not a badly planned system.  I buy nice things that are known to work well and last a long time and as such they can cost more. I don't just go buy shit and throw it in a case and pray to god it all works. I've been building PC's for a decade. All my software is updated as well as the firmware.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-06-16T02:17:35.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> All my software is updated as well as the firmware.\n\nThat is usually not a good thing. But if others are reporting the issue, either compare hardware/software and see if the is a correlation, or just wait for a fix.\n\nAlso what the shit is \"google wifi\" meant to be. Did you mean google fiber?","replies":[{"poster":"Motoriffic","date":"2018-06-16T15:39:54.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://store.google.com/product/google_wifi","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-06-16T00:00:08.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Have you tried anything at all before assuming it was the client patch and not your system, network, or the server?","replies":[{"poster":"Motoriffic","date":"2018-06-16T00:37:15.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have not changed a thing.
