A few weeks ago I all of a sudden couldn't use my forward/back buttons on the side of my  mouse. I don't know if its some option or something I did accidentally, but it is very frustrating and I can't figure out how to fix it. All my google searches bring up posts from years ago and address some other issue. Currently I am getting by with a software that i used to remap the buttons to the item keys. But it then doesn't let me use the buttons as forward and back outside of the game. I even formatted my computer (for a different reason) and it is still happening, so I believe that it is some option in the game settings or something. Thank you all for any help. -Lex","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-17T18:17:40.125+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sylvyr9 is right that this may be due to a Creator Update on Windows 10, which is preventing some mouse buttons from binding.  In this case, a roll back is suggested if you want to use those.  I don't have anymore info for now, but will keep an eye out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"On The Spiral","date":"2017-05-17T13:58:25.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ran into the same issue. From what I've noticed, it may have to do with the new Windows 10 Creators update. I guess all we can do is wait for a fix.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2017-05-17T13:25:23.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Twitch has probably been meddling with your mouse or keyboard.
