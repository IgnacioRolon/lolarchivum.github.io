But before I continue let me give some context to those who aren't familiar with the story.\n\nSo, Shen, Zed, and their master(Shen's father) captured Jhin after he went on a killing spree with a traveling circus and was given mercy by Shen's father and put in prison rather than killing him. Zed eventually goes on to kill Shen's father and embrace the way of the shadow, ostracizing himself from Shen forever. Five years pass and Zed eventually visits Shen, both disguised, in a tavern, and obviously they both recognize each other immediately, and Zed tells Shen that Jhin has escaped imprisonment. Shen, then accepts Zed's help in finding Jhin. Now, this is important, because Shen denounced Zed from his life entirely, and swore that he would never be forgiven, for he represents an imbalance. But despite this Shen accepts help from Zed, the man who murdered his father. The only reason Shen would ever do this is if he knew, in his head, that Zed was the only person capable of helping him catch Jhin. But the question still remains: would Shen and Zed be able to capture Jhin? And I don't mean find Jhin, because it's stated that Jhin's goal is to lead Shen and Zed to his location so he can perform his 'final act'. I mean could the two of them capture {{champion:202}} Jhin in his own environment with setup time, with {{champion:98}} Shen now being a master of the twilight, and {{champion:238}} Zed now being a master of the shadows.\n\nI'd love to hear a response from a Rioter, but idk how to get their attention >.&lt;","replies":[{"poster":"4 Step Cadence","date":"2019-08-04T01:46:14.889+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"The plan isn't to catch him.

What he looks like, what his background is, ect. That's what people love about him. That's what I love about him. A face reveal would ruin him for me, personally, and probably a lot of other people too.\n\nI've always said that a face reveal for Jhin would be the thing that made me quit, because his character is the only reason why I started playing, and the only reason why I stay. I have a lot of stuff that I'd have to get rid of(fan art, his figures, ect), a lot of loose ends I'd have to tie up(I'm his official roleplayer here on the boards, so I'd have to finish all my interactions before giving up my role and deleting my thread), I'd have to cancel my short story which I really wanted to finish, uninstall the game(and say goodbye to the Jhin mains), ect. Then there's the most urgent thing of all, which would be the mask I ordered for a Jhin cosplay a few days ago. I'd have to cancel that order soon so I could get a refund(wait, no, I can't, RIP $120) I'd also like to leave as soon as possible if that's the case, because I'd want to avoid all the discussions about the comic and his face and just leave remembering Jhin the way I know and love him as.\n\nI guess its my fault for loving a character that's beyond my control so much, but you have to realize that he's one of the more popular champions, and he means a lot to people. The mystery of Jhin means a lot to people. I hope you are able to understand that. Just know that if you did reveal Jhin's face, that I'm not mad at you, or the narrative team in general. I'm just... Tired, really, of all this, and I'd actually be a bit grateful if you did reveal his face because that would mean I could finally stop hanging around these toxic boards and playing this toxic game with its toxic community.

Revealing the **legendary Golden Demon**'s face to be that of an average Ionian male would be pretty crazy for in-universe characters.

Something that touches more into his mysterious \"human\" side that he masks from the world.  Whether that's through a face reveal, a glimpse into his past (like the deal about his father being a former dojo master) or deeper look into his weird theatrical psyche - I don't know, but I do know that they'll need to give us _something new _ to keep him interesting.","replies":[{"poster":"4 Step Cadence","date":"2019-08-12T19:51:29.264+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Its not just the face reveal.\nIts everything they could change about Jhin/do to Jhin + the face reveal.\n\n* They could make his eyes actually red-brown and not blue(they confirmed his eyes are supposed to be blue).\n\n\n* The could make his arm/legs mechanical and not just armor(they confirmed his arm/legs are supposed to be armor).\n\n\n* They could change literally anything and everything about him if they wanted to.\n\n\n* Fuck, they could even kill him, which would really such because then we'd never get anymore Jhin stuff in the lore.\n\nPlus, all that shit would be canon, so we wouldn't be able to speculate anymore, which sucks ass. I love writing about Jhin's past. I love thinking about what he might look like. Does that mean I want to actually know any of that stuff, though? No! We know nothing about him. The speculation about Jhin is part of the fun of his character. Not knowing anything about him doesn't make him uninteresting, repetitive, or one-dimensional. There is literally so much Riot can do with him without revealing anything about him.\n\nAlso, I think you greatly underestimate how insane they could make Jhin if they weren't restricted with a T rating. His scrapped color story, as well as a few of his voice lines(still waiting for those 12 \"they violated the game's rating\" haiku, Odin), were so graphic that they needed to be toned down/cut completely.  They had to fucking nerf Jhin so they didn't get in trouble for any graphic/disturbing content. That's how crazy he actually is.\n\nDoesn't mean we have to hold back on the violence, though. I certainly didn't when I wrote _A Lethal Masquerade_ and _In The Shadow of Greatness_, or when I just roleplayed as him in general. That's the fun of it all. I don't want all my work to be undone because Riot got a bad case of amnesia and forgot what they already established about Jhin and what makes Jhin, Jhin. Of course, I could always completely ignore everything Riot does past this point and write for myself, but that's not why I decided to do this. I want to share my work with the community, with the world, and I want my work to be a believable representation of the character I'm writing about, and I can't make that happen if I ignore what Riot does. However, if I don't want to lose my champion, my muse, I have no choice but to ignore it, because I don't want to know anything about him, nor do I want to have to rework everything to match whatever Riot retconned.\n\nI won't deny that knowing about Jhin's past or seeing his face or stuff like that would be cool for some people, but for me, and a lot of other people, we'd really rather not know, because its the mystery that we love. The speculation. The personal conclusions that we came to. Knowing what is beneath the mask, or about Jhin's past, just wouldn't feel the same.
