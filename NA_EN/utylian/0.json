Shouldn't take a completely stellar game to get a chest when getting one on a champ blocks them from getting more for an entire year.","replies":[{"poster":"Manwalrus","date":"2017-03-23T13:37:48.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would make sense if it were just tied to the loot system but it's also tied to champion mastery so it has to be difficult. What really needs to change is the drop rate of keys and chests, because even if you do get an S you still aren't guaranteed a key/chest.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2017-03-23T13:39:12.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, on that last part I was referring to the loot requirement, not the S rank.

Most karthus players are farm bots... I mean.... 300+ cs. How do we get it so high? we are always stealing both our team's raptor camps and the enemy's raptors as well as pushing out the side lanes basically taking all the farm and forcing our teammates to clear our jungle (which they should be doing anyway)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2017-03-23T13:41:31.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keep in mind that the grades are all percentile based, rather than someone at riot declaring  \"For this Champion an S grade shall require at least X cs and Y KDA and...\", so if theres a lot of really good performances on a champion by the community it can become relatively hard to get S ranks compared to champions where most people do awful.\n\nFurther remember that theres a lot more factors than just kda/cs, warding annd objective participation and various other things are also important.\n\nedit: Also remember that role matters, as karthus mid is compared to all other karthus mids but not karthus jg or top. I expect he's mostly played mid so thats probably where all your scores are from, but it's worth noting that grading standards ccan change depending on your role.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2017-03-23T10:50:18.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"umm KDA matter very little in the end... for high scroes\n\nCS and Wards are the difference between an A game and an S game","replies":[]}]}
