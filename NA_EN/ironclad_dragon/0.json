Temperature makes insects bigger, so I think even average Xer'Sai should be bigger than first picture. I also could be wrong because I dont know how is temperature of Void.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Peridition","date":"2016-02-07T17:00:25.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tough to say. But going off the _Terror Beneath_. \n\nLets say the camel like creatures are the same size as a dromedary camel. Which on avg is ~ 1,100 lbs, ~10ft long and ~7ft for a adult male. When she attacks the creature she appears at least 2.5-3x as tall and 5-6x as massive. \n\nhttps://imgflip.com/gif/yros0\n\nSo using the dromedary size as the base. I would say you're looking at a animal thats about **18ft - 21ft tall** (at the dorsal). Probably about **50-60ft long** to her tail.  Since she appears to be an invetebrate, her weight would be much harder to determine. \n\nSo basically, assuming shes around 18+ft tall and 50+ft long, she would be very similar in size to Spinosaurus who is estimated to be very similar dimensions. \n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Largesttheropods.png","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-02-07T03:46:59.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would've said she was grey whale sized, because that looks accurate to me:\n\nhttp://www.statesymbolsusa.org/sites/statesymbolsusa.org/files/gray-whale-size.jpg\n\nThey grow to be around fifteen meters long (50ish feet) and weigh in around 40ish tons.","replies":[{"poster":"Placentas","date":"2016-02-07T07:55:16.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would honestly guess more around half the size or 3/4 of the whale which is still pretty big.","replies":[]}]}]}
