I'm betting on Steel Valkyries being the second. Star Guardian is already a confirmed no (especially because Jinx is already a part of that). Super Galaxy is a slight possibility, but Steel Valkyries seems to match Odyssey's tone much more.\n\nWill you guys eventually reveal which universes are connected and put all the lores together? :D","replies":[{"poster":"Eternal791","date":"2018-09-12T04:58:41.898+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The most obvious one I was talking about was Dark Star.","replies":[{"poster":"EdgeLady","date":"2018-09-12T12:33:54.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Eternal791,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=AxXTTOG8,comment-id=000000010000000100000000,timestamp=2018-09-12T04:58:41.898+0000)\n>\n> The most obvious one I was talking about was Dark Star.\n\nWell of course, but Dark Star is one part of Event Horizon.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"XIII Vanitas","date":"2018-09-13T07:50:30.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, Dark Star & Cosmic don't share the same universe as Odyssey.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2018-09-11T21:23:28.018+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"_Evil Monster Scythe_\n**YES INDEEDY**","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zapzya","date":"2018-09-12T00:34:21.960+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo's Song and Space Lizard are the highlight of this for me.
