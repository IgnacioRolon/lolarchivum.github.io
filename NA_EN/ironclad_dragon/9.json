In all Noxus, there is no soldier more respected than Darius. Of all the commandments that have kept Noxus strong, one rule stands above all others: Loyalty is everything.","url":"http://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/comic/darius/bloodofnoxus/","image":"http://universe-comics.leagueoflegends.com/comics/en_us/darius/bloodofnoxus/desktop/darius-01-00-full.jpg"},"up_votes":39,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Timeline of the Comic**\n\n* **22 Years Ago:** Basilich submits to Noxus. Darius, Draven, and Quill are seemingly teenagers.\n* **19 Years Ago:** Darius and Quill make out at Blackrock Mere before they march off to &quot;opposite sides of the empire&quot;.\n* **10 Years Ago**: The last time Darius came to Basilich.\n* **9 Years Ago:** Darius and Quill observe the handiwork of a Zaunite alchemist (gee, I wonder who that could be). Darius reports to Captain Cyrus that the road to Navori is clear, which is a region in Ionia, meaning the invasion of Ionia took place 9 years ago. Later during the retreat, Quill&#039;s arm is amputated to prevent the alchemist&#039;s poison from killing her.\n* **5 Years Ago:** The last time Darius saw Quill in person.\n* **5 Years Agoâ€”Present:** Darius' call to arms drafts Quill's son into army, who is killed in the Freljord.\n* **Present Day:** Basilich rebels under Quill, forcing Darius and Draven to retake the city. Quill is killed by Invetia, and the city is reclaimed.\n___\nDarius and Draven hail from Basilich, a city first shown in the Medarda Heirloom that came out with the Piltover/Zaun event. If you look closely at the map, Basilich is under the stewardship of ~~Quilletta Varn~~ Invetia Varn; they were actually teased before the comic. Quill and Invetia share the same surname, and because Darius says, &quot;I thought _your son_ occupied the role,&quot; it&#039;s possible that Invetia is Quill&#039;s daughter. When Invetia kills Quill, she reminds Darius that she learned the three principles of strength from him, which lends more credence to the idea that she is Quill and Darius&#039; daughter. While talking with Quill, Darius and Draven spot ships from the city of Vindor to the south, sent by Steward Amenesce. Vindor and Amenesce were also shown on the map prior to the comic, and sure enough, they&#039;re southeast of Basilich.\nhttps://68.media.tumblr.com/ae3a682439ce06ccc2bdb99ede129561/tumblr_ouwf4jEqaG1salezdo1_1280.png\nTamara, the warmason accompanying Darius and Draven to Basilich, first appeared as the POV character of the _Progress Day_ short story (which also came out during the Piltover event), which Draven eludes to with the line \"All that time in Piltover has made you soft.\" I cannot find any other mention of Emystan, who employed the Zaunite alchemist.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2017-08-19T00:43:28.604+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":0,"body":"A map references _and_ a detailed timeline breakdown?\n\nYou and would probably be besties, Dragonzzilla!\n\nImpressed by your analysis here - good job.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Bottom Laner","date":"2017-08-19T03:40:23.806+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> You and would probably be besties, Dragonzzilla!\n\n\nWho?","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2017-08-19T04:07:37.116+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bottom Laner,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=GPdc9igl,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2017-08-19T03:40:23.806+0000)\n>\n> Who?\n\nWhoops!

Quilletta is more moral and aware, but her own emotions is leading her to try and achieve a moral victory that wouldn't dent the noxian ideal one bit if only barely if Darius is more affected that he seems.\n\nI think the issue is compromise, which Noxians have a hard time even thinking about.
