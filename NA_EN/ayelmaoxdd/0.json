Most champs don't have any problem with giving a leash and still getting back to lane in time for the first wave, but also if they don't that few CS won't make or break a game overall. Not to mention changing those spawn timers would probably change jungle play more than we'd think at first!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valeeva","date":"2017-12-10T04:19:22.935+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, Im an ADC main. There is only one ADC I have trouble with the first wave on AA ADCS like Vayne Kalista Draven. Every other ADC has a spell to pick up them first 3 minions and thats giving a full leash, down to the last auto for the jungle (smiteless). \n\nEz, MF, Cait, Ashe, Varus, Xayah, Sivir all start with their Q (or W for Xayah/Ashe) which means they can get the first three about to die minions fine. It's really only an issue for ADCs who are auto attack based and have no cleave.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-12-10T02:56:54.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who mostly plays support outside of ARAM, I do notice that sometimes we seem a bit late to the lane, but that doesn't happen too often. I've noticed it happening more often with junglers who don't start out with a jungle item. Most of the leashes I help with are smiteless, and I'll take a few hits so the jungler has a little extra life to play with. Sometimes we get to the lane as 2-3 of the minions are low, but it's not hard to get them. More often than not, me and my adc get back to the lane before the opponent does. If you all put in a decent effort in the leash, you should have no problem getting back to the lane without missing anything - and if done quick enough, you can get that few minion xp drops of level advantage over your opponent. I personally don't see it as a problem, but another factor that you have to consider and can play with. The adc can also leave the leash a bit earlier than the support if they feel like they'd otherwise be late to the lane, and they'd get a little extra exp advantage with a few minion kills without splitting exp with another person. If you reduce the time it takes for the jungle to spawn, or increase the time it takes for minions to get to the lane, you're creating a larger window for an early invade.","replies":[]}]}
