This thing stucked in my head for couple of weeks. I&#039;m curious how much &quot;ORIGINAL&quot; Urgot&#039;s body has left?

If you could answer me or draw line were his body end I would be very pleased :D","replies":[{"poster":"Interlocutioner","date":"2017-12-14T23:21:31.245+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Sirius, I spoke to Larry \"The Bravo\" Ray, the mad genius who designed all of Urgot's chem-tech parts. {{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}} \n\nHe said that he imagines Urgot has been evenly bisected, i.e. everything is cut off partway through his torso. However (**and this is a bit graphic**), his spine continues past where the rest of his torso has been cut off, to connect into the machinery beneath him. This is part of what allows his nervous system to control it. \n\nPart of his belly might also be missing behind the steel plate, his digestive system replaced with machinery. And his arm's loss is his weapon's gain.\n\nThat's as official of an answer as we can give, until something actually becomes official!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blaiz Fenix","date":"2017-12-14T15:42:42.526+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say it's probably not a straight line considering his arm and need for a respirator.
