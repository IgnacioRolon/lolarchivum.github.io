PTA does not help melee top laners in the laning phase since it's only worth it against other melee champs. The conqueror's rune is not helpful for them either, since it can only activate after you hit enemy champs or minons for an extended period of time AND it wears off after 3 seconds. The Fervor of Battle rune activated as soon as you hit a target AND it wore off after 8 seconds. Fervor allows for more damage during trades, more options for trades, and you didn't need a met condition to activate it which meant you could use the keystone whenever. It would be better if the conqueror's rune activated on hit like Fervor. Personally, I would like the effect to last longer since it takes so long to activate. On top of that, Conqueror can be used by everybody who goes AD unlike Fervor which worked better with melee champs than ranged. Electrocute and PTA are for marksmen and are the only things keeping them in a playable state, but compared to how other champs synergize with the other runes, AD melee champs are on the weaker side.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-07-15T07:42:04.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=okamiyasha95,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rEqshoE5,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2018-07-15T07:38:41.629+0000)\n>\n> I mean no, he doesn&#x27;t have a rune that specifically fits his kit.
