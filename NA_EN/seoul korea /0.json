Let me know if that clears things up!\n\nI got a Question: Why is this a thing ? I mean i live in germany but i speak Korean so i would like to play it in Korean. Why dont you just accept every language in every region, so everyone can just choose what fits for them ? I honestly need an explanation for this currently not so \"well handled\" situation.\n\nLG{{summoner:4}}","replies":[]}]}]}
