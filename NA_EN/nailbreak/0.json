There may be other factors as well, like making sure that your Windows is totally updated to the most recent version since the restoration.  Double check that update, and that you have necessary windows products available such as [Visual +++](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3387).\n\nOnce you're up to date, go over our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure that your OS is allowing access for the installer and league to open.
