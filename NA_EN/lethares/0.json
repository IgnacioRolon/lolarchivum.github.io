To add the icing on the cake, every single one of his abilities, including his passive, deal damage, whether high or low. And I&#039;m still probably missing a thing or two about him.\r\n\r\nEver since Riot started reworking champions in the middle of season 7, there has been one pattern that I have noticed. They give multiple utilities to a champion in a single ability. I noticed this since they reworked WW. All, literally ALL reworked and new champs have gap closures and some sort of heal or shield. On assassins, it makes sense. Talon, Rengar, Kayn, Akali, Irelia (although she is more bruiser)... they all need gap closures for their role and some sustainability. But let&#039;s look at Urgot, Galio, Aatrox, Ornn, Sejuani, Zac, Maokai, WW, and many more champions who have gap closures (especially after their reworks). I don&#039;t have a problem with gap closures, but giving them ten different things in QWER clearly overpowers them. Their damage vs sustain ratio is very close to 1, while the older champions have it in the gutters. Even mages like Neeko, Zoe, Ekko, Viktor, and more do tons of damage and have a freaking shield/heal.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are champions like Malphite, Teemo (sure everyone hates him, but no one plays him above plat so why even create him in the first place; players who play him only get toxicity in return), Tryndamere, Kalista, Leona, Pantheon, Kayle, Diana, Singed, Soraka, Xerath, Sivir, and more have so less in their kit (one key = one thing) that their playstyles are not just linear but straight-up boring after a while. You either rely just on your autos or a single ability most of the time. Diana probably does not fit as much here with her shield and her ult, but even then because she is an old design, she dies easily to any of the newer/reworked champs.\r\n\r\nMy problem is that every new champ they are releasing is having increasingly more things in their kit, which is getting too annoying for players like me who still play the champs they started with 3-4 years ago. No wonder League is losing loyalty. Sylas is the greatest example of this. Why give a champ everything in a kit and then later complain that you are finding it hard to balance them? Riot should have learnt their lesson after creating Yasuo long time ago, but they kept on giving multiple utilities in a single kit to every champion they have touched in the past 2-3 seasons.\r\n\r\nDo you agree that this is getting ridiculous?","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2019-01-24T00:19:04.672+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMO. \n\nIts a lot easier to balance multiple stats.  When champions are to basic they are pretty binary. It wins! It does not win.  Its strong! its Weak.  Having lots of little things give you much more room to adjust a champion. \n\nComplexity does not inherently make thigns overloaded or op. That being said its entirely realistic to find something that's OP and complex.  But frankly I feel the games healther if the most OP things are the most complex and unreliable. \n\nI don't want champions like {{champion:106}} {{champion:86}}  having the same power as {{champion:69}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:13}} . \n\nThe game doesn't exactly reflect this thou. Just my views and opinion on what makes a healthy game. Balance with skill variance between kits should not look like 50% because that's unhealthy and creates a situation where the least difficult to play things have the highest rewards. Plus like... seems impossible to achieve that anyhow.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jaspers","date":"2019-01-24T00:08:04.957+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot honestly could make a champ with everything, invulnerability frames, true damage, a stun, slow, gap closers, heals, attack speed boost, shield, % hp damage of some kind, auto reset and then an ult that changes the game yet at some point they'd be considered 'balanced' as they have a 50% win rate at some point.\n\nWait, I just described Camille... er...\n\nYet in that time they created Xayah and Rakan, 2 champs with simple mechanics, already existing ones too, that are fun to play and more fun when playing playing those champs together. I mean Rakan has a knockup, heal, shield, dashes and a charm but not one thinks it's too much due to his role and power.\n\nSadly, I think Sylas is more in the Camille camp. His heal and shield are not needed, have one, not both. While I know they wanted to create a AP fighter, I fear he's just going to turn into an AP assassin instead... that can steal Renekton's ult and get more use out of it that Renekton ever could. But the ult, is unique and looks fun, so I hope he is.","replies":[{"poster":"Lethares","date":"2019-01-24T19:54:00.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm with you on this lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Herny knock down","date":"2019-01-24T00:17:05.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that overall we can summarize it with a single word, evolution.
