I had like 400+ honorable opponents and teamwork. And newcomers can just get it like nothing. I've spent countless of years trying to get an Honor emblem but noooo you guys updated it and just took it away from me. Why not just give us the things we deserve for the honors, and leave how many times we got honored alone. I'd like to show people who look at my profile to see how much honors I had . now its ZERO JUST LIKE HOW Y'ALL ALSO TOOK AWAY HOW MANY NORMALS YOU WON LIKE I HAD 1400 GAMES IN NORMALS WON YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVED TO SHOW THAT? I FELT LIKE A VETERAN BUT NOOO YOU ALSO UPDATED THAT TOO AND CHANGED IT. THIS ISNT FUN ANYMORE I LIKE TO KEEP MY MEMORIES ON MY MATCHES AND HONORS.\r\n{{item:3073}} {{champion:32}} {{item:3073}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-30T01:31:46.399+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can still get most of that info, like total games played or won, on the [**privacy website**](http://privacy.riotgames.com/en_US/).

I was Platinum III in every queue ( Flex 3s, Flex 5s and Solo Q ) since Riot said that these new queues would have an impact at the end of season.\n\nThey first removed ARAM/Normal stats ( Wins,Turrets,Cs ) to I guess make the client less packed. ( I was and still actually tilted of them removing this ) They said they would do something about it when they released the Alpha Client wich never happened. \n\nWhen I heard about the new Honor system I was pretty excited since I had over 940 teamwork Ribbons, 450 Honorable opponent, 350 Friendly and 90 Helpful. Threw my 3 seasons of League, i've had a lot of honors given by players because I've always kept calm and be nice/professional with everyone I played with ( ofc i had some downs ). Players looking at my ribbons were always surprised on how much I try harded to get these ribbons.  I was wondering if Riot would recognize my hard work with new system...\n\nNo\n\nI just logged into my client. So... All my ribbons are gone. My Flex 3s/Flex 5s borders are gone. Now all I see is a Solo Q border and on the left the Honor Badge. Really??!!\n\nSo by doing that they just gave to anybody the opportunity of creating a lot of smurfs. Why? Simply because creating a fresh new account right now, can get you to the same kind of profile of someone who played for over 4 years. Basically what I'm trying to say is that all the effort I've put into that game are gone. Nothing left. At the moment, my smurf looks exactly like my main account. I opened it up and it is actually the same kind of profile. I'd like you guys to think on a way of giving the ancient ones the respect they deserve and the hard work they have made to play your game over all those years.\n\nI hope this get's somewhere because this is getting out of Hand.\nJérémi, best regards","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheRossJanitor","date":"2017-06-30T06:58:25.043+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, LostFrost is correct.

I really dont like having my flex rank showing first over my solo rank because it is much lower. its frustrating that i have to hover over it to see my solo q rank when it should be the rank that is showcased on my account and not in the background behind my flex q rank.
