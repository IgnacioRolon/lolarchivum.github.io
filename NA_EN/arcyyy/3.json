Getting someone else on your team to play a tank is a challenge on its own. \n\nEven in high plat, i find myself being the only tank. Whether it be Ornn or Sion i'm playing and everyone expects you to peel for mid/top AND engage properly. The amount of people that just straight up don't care about helping someone else tank is what makes Ornn so shit in solo queue. \n\nAlso, if riot plans to buff him they should remove the weird E animation stun thing (if your E doesnt connect with a wall). Or keep his current W and buff his Q or E. Why does Ornn have so much power located in his W?  I have around 40 games with him in plat 2 elo, 30 percent winrate. And he just seems so fucking weird to play. And i always question where the \"skill curve\" there is in his kit that makes him so ridiculously hard to play? His kit is actually basic and easy to use. It's just shit all around imo.\n\nI actually think my winrate will stabilize with him at some point, but like... I've never had so much trouble playing a tank in my entire time playing league\n\nI mean, i'm someone who has taken the chance of playing RELEASE ORNN all the way up until now in RANKED games and i can't say there's a point in time where i felt truly satisfied with his kit.\n\nThey buffed his mana costs. Why? Ornn's laning phase was actually already good. The problem with Ornn is that he is too difficult to use outside of the laning phase. So riot actually didnt achieve much with his mana costs buff because his core problems exist outside of the laning phase.\n\nAlso, his random AP and AD scalings? Where is the consistency in his kit? what the fuck do you build on him? \n \nThere aren't really so many items that feel good on him either. I guess abyssal mask feels good.

Q for the slow, W them, and then.... What now? The only way you get to use your E is if your enemy walks to the side of the lane next to a wall, because god knows they won't still be standing on your Q when it pops up.\n\nOrnn's issue is that he can never make plays happen, he has to wait for the enemy laner to make plays on themselves. There is no skill expression for Ornn, you just have to wait for your enemy to display a lack of skill and allow you to go in. If your enemy just stands in the middle of the lane and moves a few steps to the side any time you Q, congrats. You have no combo and no way to trade.\n\nWith a tank like Sion, you can take initiative, land E, and use that to do an easier combo. You're rewarded for hitting a difficult skillshot with making the rest of your kit easier to hit. Ornn is rewarded by hitting his Q with... nothing. Because he doesn't get to hit his Q.

I know myself and a few others on the Ornn subreddit have this ominous feeling that 20% would end up breaking him and leading to an Ivern situation or one similar that leads to him getting taken out at the knees due to his sudden power increase. Those that were ok with the change to %max HP from %current HP damage were more hoping for a lower damage buff, just more consistent throughout the fight. My stance was that %current fit him better as a tank than %max hp for W, but I was willing to accept a redistribution.\n\nMy main argument is that more damage is the last thing Ornn needs in his buffs, as he can already farm and trade well enough, but Brittle should be his focus. One discussion I had with a poster on one of my threads here led to them suggesting reducing duration (I though reduced damage could be a good alternative too) in exchange for Brittle to be applied to enemies in other ways, like the initial charge on E, especially if you donâ€™t hit terrain since it does absolutely nothing then.","replies":[{"poster":"Infernape","date":"2017-10-09T03:04:19.380+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair though his W isn't straight up front loaded damage say like Fiora's passive.
