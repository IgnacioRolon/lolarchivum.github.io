I thought Riot was taking a break from these disasters after it was mentioned a while back that you wanted to be working with simpler kits.\n\nAlso mentioned a while back, (3  years ago by Statikk, 2 by Morello, and 5 months ago by Cezium to name a few) was  that Riot recognized mobility creep as a problem - primarily around the  time you released Kalista...as if you didn't anticipate what that passive would do, but I digress.  Since then, we've seen mobility metastasize and grow out of control, and with new overloaded, hypermobile releases like Camille's and unhealthy reworks like Fiora's, along with the existence of Protobelt as if you thought the answer for non-mobile champs was _add more mobility,_  it shows you still don't have plans to stop this nonsense.  \n\n And that's just the topic of mobility, I could describe the power-creeped chaos you all seem to love seeing as unnecessarily overstuffed kits and percent health and / or true damage for no reason to go with their mobility in addition to Keystones still being in the game despite breaking the already damaged balance of the game and adding absurd power to everything, but I feel like you get the idea.\n\nSo with the rant out of the way, what's the plan here?
