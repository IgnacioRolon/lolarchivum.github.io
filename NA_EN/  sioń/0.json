Please fix Sion (List of bugs on Q,E,R and autoattack)","subforum":"Report a Bug","up_votes":95,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright so I am a Sion one trick. I wanted to start season 8 with of course playing my trust worthy boy Sion but right now its close to impossible.\r\nHe has had bugs in the past but it feels like every couple of weeks another one gets by, with his Q being bugged now and with some times auto attacks dont register being new this last patch.  At this point I dont want to play Sion right now and as a one trick that means i kinda dont want to play league which sucks because I enjoy this game but with my favorite champion having a bug on 3 out of his 4 abilities is insane... Please riot fix Sion.\r\n\r\nAlright before I go over the bugs let me mention that I don&#039;t have any videos of me personally because i have a slow computer that can&#039;t record however i do have other peoples videos which if anything proves that the bugs are not client side, but anyways i have been ranting to long here are the bugs\r\n\r\nQ- Decimating Smash\r\nWhat it should do: If the channel is interrupted, Decimating Smash goes on a reduced 2 seconds cooldown.\r\n\r\nWhat it does: When the channel is interrupted it does not go on a reduced cooldown and instead goes on a full cooldown.\r\n\r\nThe bug on his Q is pretty huge and is as fall as i can tell came out of this last patch.  So instead when a  champ stuns me or stops my Q in a team fight i can&#039;t wait two seconds and try to protect my carry with a Q instead i become useless unless i have my ult which in most cases i use to start the team fight\r\nProof:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_GBMztixKc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_GBMztixKc)\r\n\r\nE-Roar of the Slayer\r\nWhat it should do: Projectile enemies stop upon colliding with terrain or reaching the end of their trajectory.\r\nWhat it does: Instead if the minion is at low enough health it just dies without giving Sion gold nor does it go the full length or give damage to enemy if hit\r\nProof: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv2y_6speto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv2y_6speto)\r\n\r\nR-Unstoppable Onslaught\r\nWhat it should do: Sion charges in the target direction for up to 8 seconds\r\n\r\nWhat it does: Sometimes Sion will charge at the opposite direction if the cursor is near the Ui at the bottom (Sion portrait, mini map, and ability icons)\r\nNow this one is really annoying, but self explanatory Sion sometimes ults in a different direction instead of where the cursor is pointing if the cursor is near the bottom of the screen next to or on the Sion portrait, mini map, and ability icons.\r\nProof: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-81iU13300&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-81iU13300&amp;feature=youtu.be)\r\n\r\nAutoattacks\r\nWhat it should do: Do i need to explain?\r\n\r\nWhat it does: Stops mid animation and doesn&#039;t register\r\nAlright that is not really explaining but this is kinda new but has really happened a lot this last patch.This has also happened to me even in passive which has costed me kills. Many people have told me they have also experienced this bug so i know this is not client side.  \r\nProof: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJlmX4VOZpM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJlmX4VOZpM)\r\n\r\nI really want to start my season 8 climb but with all of these bugs, they are costing me games.

We've been able to track down the issue and the fix is ready to go out with the next patch coming out next week. The E bug is on our radar and we're working on a fix for it in the future.\n\nAs for the other issues, some of them pertain to the general game more than being Sion specific and are being looked at (Minimap/Portrait clicking over the HUD)\n\n**UPDATE:** : I've also fixed the issue where Learning W in zombie mode did not provide him with the proper HP gains. Also still working to get a fix on the E bug by 8.3. Thanks everyone for the replies!\n\n\nThank you so much for the report, those can really help us prioritize certain issues.\n {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Cirrusstrafe","date":"2018-01-17T21:09:54.950+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it helps any, I documented my findings about E via the Training tool.  Sorry for throttling you with information, bughunting is kind of a passion of mine and seeing responsiveness kickstarts my engine something fierce:\n\n**The E**\nIt appears as if an exterior source kills the target or applies enough damage to the target immediately after E hits the minion, then the minion is scripted to die (full stop of collision body, and doesn't even count as you killing it.) This actually ends up being an interesting situation:\n\nIf E doesn't do enough damage to the minion to kill it, then it applies the damage to the minion immediately.\nIf E would do enough to kill the minion outright, then for the whole damn ability to work, it must not take the damage until after it hits terrain/distance.\n\nThis opens up a window of opportunity whereupon the minion can be at extremely low health, Sion E's it, then the minion gets another source of damage (your sunfire cape + various caster minions, anyone else attacking it) in which it will take immediate damage, die, and do all the things a minion does when it dies. Since your ability didn't finish it off per se, it doesn't give you gold, etc.  It was a pain in the ass to replicate in the training tool but I finally got it to reproducible steps.\n\nReally, the problem with Sion's E is that **rather than freeze the minion's HP if Sion's E would kill it, until it stops and then kill the thing** it instead holds off on applying Sion's E damage until it hits its end **which allows for other damage sources to pre-empt or cheat Sion's E out of doing its job.**\n\n\nFurthermore, given someone else's findings about Sion's W not working when leveled up during his passive (as in, tragically dying just as he hit level 3) I did some deep passive investigation as well.\n\n**Passive**\n\n* If you skill up W for the first time during Sion's passive it will no longer give you 10 max health on every big kill/assist, and only give you 2 per minion for the remainder of the game.  Leveling it up after the fact while alive does not fix it.  Leveling W up to rank 1 while alive, then leveling it up afterwards while his passive is up will **not** trigger the bug.  Neither will ranking W up for the first time while transitioning to passive (stasis point) nor doing it while greyscreen'd after the passive expires.\n\n* If Sion has over 1.75 attack speed pre-death (e.g. a few Nashor's tooth or something), then Sion's passive will actually reduce his attack speed down to the new cap of 1.75.\n\n* Fleet Footwork, unlike Luden's/DMP/Statikk, does not stack nor activate when in passive.\n\n* Lethal Tempo does not incorporate Sion's passive attack speed cap (1.75).  \nIf Lethal Tempo would take Sion's attack speed (say 1.70) and boost it above 1.75, then Lethal Tempo's bonus override's Sion's passive, resetting to 1.75 after Lethal Tempo expires.\nConclusion: Sion's attack speed \"bonus\" in his passive is actually a secondary cap.  Since Lethal Tempo allows him to exceed attack speed caps it lets him surge past 1.75 if Lethal Tempo modifies pre-death attack speed to beyond 1.75\n\nI hope some of this helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Zhanos","date":"2018-01-17T21:44:10.141+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is actually a superb analysis of the E bug.

That's what the \"odd behavior\" is.\n\nGonna use fake math here for ease.\n\nLet's say Sion has 1.0 attack speed and let's pretend Lethal Tempo moves it to 1.5.  50% increase.\nIf Sion goes to passive, he is set to 1.75 attack speed (with 1.0 internal, remember).\nHe procs Lethal Tempo during his passive.  He remains at 1.75 attack speed instead of what I would have assumed to be 2.63 attack speed (50% increase on 1.75)\nThis is because Lethal Tempo is only modifying the hidden, internal attack speed, not the passive adjusted attack speed.  This is the part that felt odd because the next part works as I'd assume:\n\nIf Sion has 1.70 attack speed and Lethal Tempo moves it to 2.55.  50% increase.\nIf Sion goes to passive, he is set to 1.75 attack speed (with 1.70 internal).\nHe procs Lethal Tempo during his passive.  He moves to 2.55 attack speed for the duration of Lethal Tempo.\n\nEffectively, it's odd to me that Lethal Tempo doesn't modify the attack speed you are set to during your passive but will still modify the then-obfuscated \"alive\" attack speed and only alter your attack speed  during your passive accordingly if LT kicks the \"alive\" attack speed over the passive capped speed.\n\nIf this is intentional to otherwise balance his passive's honestly ludicrous damage then that's fine, and it's clearly not actually a bug, it just felt odd to mess around in training tool and have my attack speed gutted when I'm used to it spiking during passive.","replies":[{"poster":"AnataBakka","date":"2018-01-18T12:45:40.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think the passive just gives you enough attack speed to reach that cap, but you're not able to surpass that cap if you don't have enough attack speed and lethal tempo","replies":[{"poster":"Cirrusstrafe","date":"2018-01-19T06:54:44.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That appears to be correct.
