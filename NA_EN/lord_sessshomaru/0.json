I usually play 1768x992, but when I switch to that resolution, or to full screen, or anything like that once the game begins, it just kind of glitches out and makes it so I can't click or do anything, and the resolution is not even close to the 1768x992 I have been used to for ages. Now I tried other programs such as GW2, and they all worked fine. I don't believe it made any changes to my drivers, so I am totally at a loss as what I can even try. It runs fine until after the character selection, when the game launches. The match-up screen is windowed, and then the game launches in the smallest possible resolution. I have also tried restore defaults, and a few other things. \r\nShould I just reinstall LoL from scratch?  Nvidia has about 8 billion options in the settings as well, so I am not sure if that could be it. Has anyone else run into this problem, or have a suggestion?","replies":[{"poster":"Leo Gemini 7","date":"2017-03-01T10:49:44.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep same issue with me too.
