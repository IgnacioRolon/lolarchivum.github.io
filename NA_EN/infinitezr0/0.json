Can't do anything.  \nGame sound stops but spotify still plays, but I can't do anything. Screen entirely frozen, including my mouse pointer.  \nCan't tab out, can't ctrl alt del, or ctrl shift esc.  \nHave to hard reset computer and reload the game.  \nGame usually ends before it can happen again.\n\nE: To add to that, might be just a coincidence. But I recently got a new Predator X34 monitor, the 21:9 aspect ratio monitor. I play in full screen in 2560x1440(16:9) resolution with black bars on the side.  \nDunno if that could be anything, but as far as I remember, that's the only thing that's really changed in the computer since this has been happening.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-05T00:36:12.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you on Windows 10?  A Windows update auto-enabled the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) which can cause freezing like the one mentioned.  Disabling it should fix the issue.  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"InfiniteZr0","date":"2017-01-06T01:39:56.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll try that.
