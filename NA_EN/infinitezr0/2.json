Let me know if you have any questions.\n\nIs there any chance of a rework in the pipeline to where rerolling multiple skins worth X amount of essence locks out the lowest tier (or 2nd lowest, etc.) from showing up in the result? For example, rerolling enough essence to entirely create a 1350 skin would lock out 520 RP skins, enough for a 1820 would lock out 750 RP, and enough for a 3250 RP skin would lock out 975 RP skins? Something to give some incentive to reroll rarer skin shards you dislike without the chance of, say, rerolling 2 1820 RP skins and a 975 RP skin and getting a 520 RP skin for one of the champions the 1820 RP skin was for.\n\nBecause currently any skin worth 975 RP + seems almost a waste to reroll, as the essence cost to reroll 3 decent skins is so high and the chance of a decent skin is so meh that rerolling high tier skins is almost always a trap.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-08T15:40:41.579+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a great suggestion!

Let me know if you have any questions.\n\nHey Targons Blade, big appreciation for the work you're doing. You've filled up the Red Tracker!\n\nI have a similar question to the InfiniteZr0, but it has to do with the Essence gained from rerolling skins. I know if skin fragments/permanents are rerolled into a less valuable skin permanent, then the player will be given Essence. My question is: how much Essence will the player get? Is there a simple way for me to calculate how much bonus Essece I'll get from rerolling my skins if the skin that I get is worth X RP?\n\nSay I reroll a 1350 RP skin shard, a 975 RP skin shard, and a 1350 RP skin shard, and it turns out to be a 750 RP skin permanent. How much Essence would I get, if any? What if that 975 was a 1350 skin shard?\nWhat if I reroll a 3250 skin shard, a 460 skin shard, and a 750 skin shard, and get a 750 skin permanent?\n\nI know you must be busy, but I'd appreciate it a ton if you answered my question.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-08T15:48:48.363+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey friend, thanks for the kinds words!\n\nAs far as I know, based both on personal experience and on the information in the Hextech Crafting Guide, the essence you get with rerolls is completely random. Much like the rest of rerolling system, there isn't a way to calculate when and where something specific would happen. I  just tested a reroll with one epic skin shard and two normal value skin shards and obtained no essence and a normal valued skin permanent out of it.\n\nI hope this clears it up for you. ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-08-08T15:59:07.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, you sure about that? I'm pretty sure at least the \"Mystery Champion Shard\" gives a non-random amount of Essence after the random Champion Shard drop, to compensate if you get a very cheap Champion.
