I play on the Mac client, which may or may not be the home for the issue. Due to my inexperience with programming, I am unsure as to whether or not this problem is due to conflicting software, an internal problem with the Mac client, or any other slew of possibilities. I have taken a screenshot of what I see while playing, but I cannot figure out how to attach it to this thread because my lack of familiarity with boards (this is my first post). However, I am confident that this problem will be addressed due to the gamer-conscious nature of Riot...er...Rito...uh...\n\nRegardless of my banter, I believe that this fix (if there is indeed a problem) will improve the visual consistency and clarity for gamers. My reason for griping about this is that it is unnecessarily more challenging to farm and teamfight with this visual conflict between the outline and the object. I hope this is taken into consideration and quickly fixed! I am more than happy to share the screenshot I have taken if provided instruction on how to do so.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: Here's the screenshot :D\n\nhttp://imgur.com/yLs6yjb","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-13T04:44:55.122+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey EL MUCHACHO,\n\nThanks for the report!

It's taking longer than expected to completely fix this issue, but rest assured, this is on our radar!
