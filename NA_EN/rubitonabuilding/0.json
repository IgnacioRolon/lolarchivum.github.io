I'd hate to have worked so hard on my latest lore/champ concepts and not be able to post it. :C","replies":[{"poster":"MaliceCity","date":"2014-04-16T20:57:17.448+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, thanks for reporting this.

The one in question I titled \n\n\"[Champion Concept] Coming soon...\"\n\nIt was just a post to let people know I was working on a cool lore thing involving a bunch of my new champ concepts. The post was not important at all. I'm just worried that it might happen again with a real post.\n\nThe weird part is if I make a new post and start typing [Champ... \n\nThe title of my post (as above) shows up in the auto-finish list. Obviously somewhere it knows I made that post. \n\n\nThanks for the help!\n\nP.S. While I've got a red's attention, I know this isn't related to the site at all, but when I'm loading into a game and I minimize it to read/post on the forums (because why waste time staring at a loading screen for 5 minutes), sometimes part of my screen (the left 3/4) stays black and I can't do anything until I've managed to re-open the loading window and minimize it again. IDK what's going on there.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2014-04-16T14:30:54.971+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can answer the P.S.! \n\nThe game client (a.k.a. not the menu AIR client) is still hobbling itself together at that point and is essentially demanding your graphic's attention. This happens to me  quite often (for the exact same reason). It'll play nice if you just wait for all the player 'squares' to load in, they don't have to be 100% or anything, just visibly there. And then when you minimize it'll stay minimized.","replies":[{"poster":"Rubitonabuilding","date":"2014-04-16T15:10:50.532+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"IT WORKS. \n\n{{champion:106}} {{item:3048}} \n\n^That's a bear hug.
