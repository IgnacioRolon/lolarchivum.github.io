{"poster":"Rubitonabuilding","date":"2014-04-30T17:12:28.569+0000","title":"[Champion Concept] Ariel, the Poromancer","subforum":"Community Creations","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, [Banshee](http://community.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/fancreations/4GVLnVGX-champion-concept-banshee-the-screaming-specter) was a pretty serious/scary champion concept. I thought I'd lighten the mood with a silly champion like Ariel. Her kit revolves around making poros do her bidding. \n---\n\n### Appearance/Character\n\n---\nAriel is a really nice, friendly girl, maybe a bit of a klutz, and she gets the poros to do what she wants by feeding them. Technically the term \"poromancer\" would mean something like \"one who does magic involving poros\", but there's no real magic involved here besides procuring Poro-Snax. All Ariel does is toss out snacks in certain ways to attract poros. \n\nPoros in themselves are harmless critters, only interested in eating, sleeping, and other poro-related matters. A poro will never intentionally hurt a person, but they can certainly be used to inconvenience one's enemies!\n\nAriel has red hair and is maybe 25-30 years old. She's attractive enough (because Rito won't make a female champion who's not marginally attractive), and has a bubbly disposition, something like Lux's. I have no idea who she'd be associated with lore-wise, maybe Braum if we find out he has a pet poro? \n\n---\n\n### Abilities\n\n---\n\n####Passive: **Poro-Snax Packs**\n\n- Ariel has no power over the poros unless she can feed them. Instead of mana, Ariel uses Poro-Snax for her abilities and generates 6 Poro-Snax per minute, carrying 4 sacks of Poro-Snax around her waist that hold 30 Poro-Snax each (120 Poro-Snax (P.S. from here on) to start). One item slot is reserved for this purpose (i.e. she starts with the P.S. packs item at no cost), and she can upgrade her P.S. packs (at gold cost) through three different paths, similar to Viktor's Hex Core items. \n\n\n- **Path 1: Poro-Snax Potency**\n\n - Potent Poro-Snax\n   - This increases the duration of all of Ariel's abilities\n - Perfectly Potent Poro-Snax\n   - This increases the duration of, and adds special effects to, Ariel's abilities. \n\n- **Path 2: Poro-Snax Production**\n\n - Poro-Snax Producer\n   - This increases Ariel's P.S. production from her base production of 6 per minute, to 10 per minute. \n - Professional Poro-Snax Producer\n   - This increases P.S. production to 12 per minute, and reduces Ariel's Cooldowns by 10%\n\n- **Path 3: Six Poro-Snax Packs**\n - Six Poro-Snax Packs\n   - This adds 2 sacks of P.S., increasing Ariel's max P.S. to 180.\n - Six Snazzy Poro-Snax Packs\n   - This upgrades all of Ariel's P.S. packs to hold 40 each, increasing her maximum P.S. to 240. \n\n---\n\n####Q: **Poor Poro!** (2/3/4/5/6 P.S.)\n\n- Ariel summons a single poro at a target location. Enemy champions who encounter the poro are overcome by its cuteness, and charmed toward it for (0.5/0.75/1/1.25/1.5) seconds. Enemies cannot be charmed twice by the same poro.\n- The poro remains on the ground for (4/6/8/10/12) seconds and cannot be injured. \n- **Perfectly Potent** bonus: The poro remains on the ground for an additional 1 second per level (maximum 17 seconds at level 5). Each person who is charmed toward the poro feeds it 2 PS. If all 5 enemies are charmed, the poro will have consumed 10 PS and explodes into 8 poros, dealing *very* low physical damage to anyone hit (like 5 damage or something). \n\n#### W: **Hail of Poros** (10/12/14/16/18 P.S.)\n\n- Ariel scatters a handful of PS over an area. Poros rain down from the sky to gobble up the Snax, each dealing (5/10/15/20/25 + 0.3AP) physical damage if they hit an enemy.\n- **Perfectly Potent** bonus: the duration of **Hail of Poros** is increased by 20%\n\n#### E: **Borrow a Poro** (2/4/6/8/10 P.S.)\n\n- Ariel lends a poro to an allied champion, who gains increased HP regen, MR, and movement speed for the duration (based on Ariel's AP). \n- These poros have HP based on Ariel's AP and can be damaged by any spell. The poro is extremely nimble and cannot be basic attacked, but it will intercept projectiles as a normal minion would. The bonus stats end if the poro dies.\n- **Perfectly Potent** bonus: the duration of **Borrow a Poro** is increased, and the target also gains a *very* minor attack speed buff. \n\n#### R: **The Problem With Poros** (1 ---> 30 P.S. (or up to 40 with six PS packs))\n\n- Ariel \"accidentally\" spills one of her sacks of PS. A veritable flood of poros swarms around it, numbering 5 per snack dropped. Enemies are slowed/snared by the sheer volume of poros around them (unless they have phantom dancer or ghost etc to avoid unit collision). These poros also have HP based on Ariel's AP, and can be easily cleared by AOE spells. Allies do not collide with the poros.\n- There is a minimum of 5 poros (1 Snax) and a maximum of 200 poros (40 Snax). \n\n---\n\nSo yeah. Rhyming and Alliteration and Tongue-Twisters galore! Ariel is pretty much just a joke champion concept, but I thought it would be funny if there was a Poromancer in the League of Legends. \n\nLet me know what you think! \n\nP.S.

Ever.  \n* Poros should not die. Ever.  \n* Nobody should be forced to deal damage to poros. Ever.  \n\nHere're my thoughts to make Ariel into a viable champion without sacrificing any poros to {{champion:17}} \n\n---\n###Passive: Poro-Snax Pax\n>Make her PS pack be a trinket, like rengar's bonetooth necklace.\n\n###Q: Poor Poro\n>Should act like shaco's jack-in-the-boxes. Once it charms someone, it disappears from the map.\n\n###W: Snack Toss\n> Ariel throws a poro-snack in a straight line (skillshot). If it hits an enemy champion, it deals 1 damage to them and sticks to them. A poro begins following the enemy around, begging for the snack. This reveals the enemy and distracts them, lowering their [stats, could be AR/MR/AD/AP/MS/Whatever] for the duration of the reveal. The duration and amount of stat reduction scales with Ariel's AP.\n\n###E(1): Toggle off: Aura of Cuteness\n>Ariel attracts poros to herself. Their healing aura grants her increased HP regen (based on AP). Additionally, they are so cute that enemies do not want to damage her, so Ariel takes 3/6/9/12/15% (+ 2% per 100 AP) reduced damage from all sources.\n\n###E(2): Toggle On: Borrow A Poro\n\n>Ariel steadily hands her ally poro snax, costing X poro snax per time. As a result, the poros that normally follow Ariel around follow around her ally instead, granting them the Aura of Cuteness buff. However, since Ariel is actually quite frail without her Poros, she takes the same 3/6/9/12/15% (+ 2% per 100 AP) of increased damage. Since Ariel is constantly handing her ally poro-snax, she must stay close to them or this ability will cancel. Like Anivia's ult, when the ability cancels (or is turned off), it goes on cooldown, during which time there is neither a buff nor debuff.\n\n###R: Exporosion\n\n>Ariel throws a bag of poro-snax to an area, where it falls open coating anything in the area with poro snax. This zone persists for 3/4/5 seconds. Any enemy champion hit gets Ariel's W applied to them, and any allied champion hit gets Ariel's E effect applied. These affects stay applied even if the champs leave the zone. Additionally, any enemy or allied champs who enter the zone get the affect applied. However, the affect does not continue to apply to them if they leave the zone. All effects end once the zone ends. Effects do not stack if ariel uses w or e while her ult is active.\n>\n>It is important to note here that the W and E effects are applied *at the level of w and e*, so if Ariel prioritizes e, her ult will give more damage reduction; if she prioritizes her w, it will reduce enemy stats by more.","replies":[{"poster":"Rubitonabuilding","date":"2014-05-02T12:27:14.864+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"All of this. +3 internets to you. \n\nTBH I made up this whole kit before I knew that Poros were invincible, so I'll clearly have to re-work it. \n\nI like all of your suggestions, except the ult (don't get me, wrong, I like it, but I won't use it). The reason being, my whole intention around creating a Poromancer was so that we could have a **problem with poros** ultimate. You might be too young (as am I, so I don't know why I know this) to remember a certain original star trek episode entitled \"The Trouble With Tribbles\". I encourage you to search google images for that. \n\nHere, I did it for you:\n\nhttp://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090530212257/memoryalpha/en/images/f/fa/Kirk_surrounded_by_Tribbles.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-05-02T15:47:54.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are the mechanics of her \"The Problem with Poros\" ult necessary? Like, could we just rename what I created to that? I actually considered adding a slow to the effect of her ult also, but deemed it too OP (although, if a slow were part of her w, then her ult would also have a slow). If the slow is necessary, her ult might be balance-able if you include in her ult:\n>Ariel's self-debuff stacks when her buff is applied to multiple allies during her ultimate, causing her to take (3/6/9/12/15% (+ 2% per 100 AP))* (# of allies buffed) more damage.\n\nI'd also just like to throw out there that, if done right, Ariel should be balancable as an AP champ, a tank, or an adc. Even though she has practically no offensive capabilities, she should be able to outtrade a lot of her opponents through her damage reduction, debuff to them, cc, and regen. If you build her with a little AD (which you would need to if she's getting a solo lane) you should even be OK on waveclear and/or lasthitting under turret.","replies":[{"poster":"Rubitonabuilding","date":"2014-05-02T16:29:32.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only mechanic really necessary for **The Problem With Poros** is that there be a completely overwhelming number of poros.
