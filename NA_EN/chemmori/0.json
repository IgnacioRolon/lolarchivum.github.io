After traveling through ionia, learning and tracking, he came across a book which had countless centuries worth of knowledge. This book was concieved by what veigar calls &quot;the omnipotence&quot;. Even just seeing the words in this book, veigars mind was corrupted, and he learned not only how to use magic, but to grasp the very fabric of reality. Although veigar is still concious his corrupted mind is telling him to find the omnipotence, so he may save himself from an eternity of insanity. Unfortunatly, the omnipotence didn&#039;t write the book, the book was written by another person corrupted by the omnipotence. As for who this presence is, nobody knows, As its only known by the corrupting knowledge of the book. The omnipotence is already with veigar, and the vicious cycle will repeat itself eventually.\n\nPassive: Mark of the omnipotence\nVeigar is a unique mage for the fact that he doesn&#039;t use mana, instead he uses corruption (its a working title, i haven&#039;t found a name i like yet). When the game starts, or when he respawns, he starts off with 100, with the max being 500. When he goes back to fountain, it will only refill to 100. Veigar gets more corruption by damaging minions or champions with autos, or spells. Autos give 10, and abilities give 50.\nwhen veigar is at 500 corruption, his spells get a unique effect, at the cost of going down to 50.\n\n\nQ: Baleful Strike \nVeigar shoots a skill shot that stops at the second target it, or at its maximum range. If it either kills a minion, or hits an enemy champion, its cooldown is slightly reduced, and half of the cost is refunded.\nQ (Max Corruption)\nthe ability becomes a point and click, and after the cast, the ability will bounce up to 5 times, or until it hits a champion. It does bonus magic damage to the last target, or the champion it hits.\n\nW: Spreading the word\nVeigar executes a minion or large monsters (not epic) below 20% health (10% for large monsters). When this happens, the minion will explode, creating a damaging 300 unit aoe. If any minions that are below 20% get caught in it, they will also explode, creating the same effect. This is veigars ultimate waveclear ability. If veigar casts this on a minion above the threshold, or on a champion (regardless on health) it will just do damage, and will slightly refund the cooldown. Minions in the explosion of an executed minion above the threshold will only take damage. EDIT: If this ability does enough damage to kill a minion above the threshold, it will execute, and continue the explosion effect anyway, same with the aoe explosion. If used on a champion, it will only do damage, but will still do the explosion effect.\nW (Max Corruption)\nVeigar can execute a minion regarldess of health, and minions below 50% caught in that explosion will explode. This does not work on champions, or epic monsters.\n\nE: Grasping Horizon\nVeigar graps the fabric of the rift, creating an aoe slow for 3 seconds (think veigars current e, but shaped more like a hand). After the 3 seconds, the fingers of the hand will shoot 500 units towards veigar, doing magic damage to anything caught by the fingers. This ablility will leave behind &quot;tears&quot;, which is relavent to veigars ultimate. He can only have up to 2 tears at a time.\nE (Max corruption)\nThe damaging part of the ablility will go away from veigar 500 units before coming towards veigar 1000 units from there.\n\nR: Tears in reality\n\nEDIT: Passive:\nveigar gains bonus ap based on how much corruption he has, for every 100, veigar gains 20 bonus ap.\n\nActive:\nVeigar grabs a hold of any enemy champion foolish enough to be in the tears (aoe 600 unit suppresion) for 3 seconds. During this time, veigar is immobile. EDIT: If any minions are caught in the suppresion, they are instantly executed, regardless of health, and if any champions below 15% percent are caught, they are executed in veigars hands.\nEDIT: (ability can be cast while the E slow is active)\nR (Max corruption)\nVeigar is able to move during the suppresion (but silenced) and if theres at least one enemy champion in both of the tears, they switch places.\n\nI&#039;m no game designer, I just wrote down what I thought would be cool for a champions kit to be, while making sure the concept gives veigar an idenity. I&#039;d love to hear suggestions and feedback.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-09-05T01:39:49.245+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think his current lore is much better, being a twisted mind because he was tortured in the prisons of Noxus.\n\nAs for his skills, his AP stacking is essential to his identity. You can't take it away from him.\n\nThe W is basically a dead spell, as you can farm without it and no enemies are going to stand near minions if they know they are playing against it. It basically provides nothing to the character. The current W is fairly unique, not many characters have a skill that does that much damage in an aoe. It is also good from an interaction standpoint. You can't just cast it, there is no champ in the game that would have a hard time dodging it. Instead you either have to catch them with your E or place it somewhere where they either have to get caught by you/a teammate or take the hit. Also, his current W will execute minions below 20% in almost every case, so it would just be a flat out nerf.\n\nThe E is interesting. I like it. On his current kit it could cause him to be overloaded unless his overall damage numbers were lowered, but as a concept it is interesting.\n\nR is also interesting, but it seems kinda like an almost strait up worse Malz ult. Not to mention how satisfying the current one is. Press R on target, Veigar yells \"DELEEEETE!\" (final boss best skin) and a giant ball/cube of power flies at your target and blows them up. I wouldn't be too against a change, I just don't like this one on Veigar.","replies":[{"poster":"ChemMori","date":"2017-09-05T01:54:04.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I was writing this down, I wanted to keep the \"essence\" of his current passive, make it feel like you're working for something, but keep it so its not frustrating, especially late game, for the enemy team. So the Max corruption thing is what the player would be working for, but its not up all the time, like the current passive. When I was thinking of an ult, I had teamfight potential in mind, but you have a point about it being a very satisfying and essential part of his kit. As for the W, You have a good point, so I'll think of a way to incorporate dark matter, while keeping it fresh and new.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChemMori","date":"2017-09-05T14:54:12.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I made Edits to the concepts W and Ultimate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sad Tyrant","date":"2017-09-05T14:49:04.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to agree with Zezockary.\n\nhis current lore is much better (IMOO) \n\nhis Current w is better because \n\nhttps://cdn-webimages.wimages.net/0517f1a6e4d110124048b3bc70f8f1d903b0c3.jpg?v=3\n\nit doesn't help him in team fights, and it doesn't help his late game (which is what he is know for)\n\nand I hate **Gimmicks**, why you ask, because {{champion:72}}'s Passive and {{champion:154}}'s ult, I loved these champions and the reworks alienated that\n\nand the R is **conditional** on the E, thats a problem\n\nI know this may be Brutal, but that is because I like Veigar the way he is.
