I didn't understand abilities and kits fully until I started checking out the LoL wiki and getting more of a feel as to what's healthy to include in a champion concept.

After rethinking it, I have decided to continue creating concepts. I will ask my brother for help with kits, he has put over 1,400 hours into the game and knows it better than anyone I know. Don't worry, the ability ideas will still be mine, but he will just help with balancing the stats of the champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-05-01T22:13:06.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've logged about 5,000 hours into this game, play ranked, hang onto every word uttered at the analysts' desk, and am a professional game designer, and yet I still struggle with kits constantly.\n\nKeep going, read everything you can, find something that inspires you and get back at it ASAP.  You'll never truly feel ready, so there's no point in waiting until you do.","replies":[]}]}
