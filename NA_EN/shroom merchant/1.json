Theres already over auto unlocked champs in aram as of this patch, and even before then ARAM accounts would get sorted by MMR such that theyd be fighting themselves. People complain everything is an aram account just because they rolled lux or ziggs or xerath regardless. Fact is people dodge games where they get crap rolls or reroll bad picks so good picks show up more often. Aram only accounts are near non existent in the mode.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-06-03T23:44:11.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:6}}","replies":[]}]}
