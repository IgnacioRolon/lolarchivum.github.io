I've since some what narrowed down on the issue.\n\nWhen I have open web pages (Google Chrome), I go through Champion Select with no issues.\n\nWhen Champion Select is complete and the game begins to load in, If I have web pages open, I get a pop up from windows that says;\n\n_Your Computer Is Low On Memory\nTo Restore enough memory for programs to work correctly, save your files and then close and restart all programs._\n\nAt this point, the Loading Screen for League of Legends crashes out and returns me to the client, that says the game has crashed and has an option to reconnect. After clicking on reconnect, it brings up the League of Legends logo and after a few moments, says that my internet connection is not working or something to that affect.\n\nI don't believe I'm low on memory and I certainly don't believe that my internet is just going down every time I load a League of Legends game.\n\nClosing out ALL applications, restarting the League client and reconnecting to the game usually works for me. However, I wouldn't call that an ideal solution. I normally can stream the game to Twitch, have Spotify music playing in the background, open web pages and a League of Legends game connecting, loading in, and playable. It's just something odd at this point is now stopping all of that.\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-02T15:49:28.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not familiar with any memory specific errors from League, but you could be having a hardware issue.  I'd like to help but need more information.  When you say crash, what exactly is happening and when?  Do you get an error message and what does it say?  Let me know!","replies":[]}]}
