Taliyah has a very sharp learning curve and with this change, I find you've made it much more difficult to play her. It has hurt more than help.\n\nI was very outspoken, as well as many other players about the (W) change before this patch went live. [I read the Red Post from Riot](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/1bunGEHs-taliyah-changes-for-614) about how the change would make her more efficient and about how the &quot;Lockout&quot; from casting Seismic Shove was not a good mechanic. However, I simply disagree. I understand this may be from being so used to the old (W) however, I also don&#039;t like that were talking about [nerfing](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/EjprL83E-attn-rocksurfers-seismic-shove-changes-in-internal-testing) her just based on this (W) change. Who in their right mind as a Taliyah Main would vote for this W change knowing that Nerfs are coming in with it as well? I&#039;ve tried the casting out and I feel locked out just based on the way it is cast now.\n\nThis new Seismic Shove cast is clunky. Please revert back to Taliyah&#039;s original cast on Seismic Shove.\nPlease up vote this thread for recognition.

Here's my opinion:\n\nFirst of all, I've only played one game with the new casting paradigm, and I found it much more cumbersome than the old one. Obviously this is because I haven't had time to get used to it, however, I don't see the reasoning why this is a change that had to be made over a month after her release. This is a fundamental shift which demolishes the learning curves that us mains have put so much time into mastering. While I agree that with some time I will probably get used to it, I just found it so unsatisfying to play. \n\nNow, I get the reasoning for the change (be able to remove the spell lockout after casing W), however I don't understand why this couldn't simply be done with the old casting method. It was noted that removing the lockout would open up the W-E combo adding significant power, so they strongly nerfed the E to compensate. This change could have absolutely been applied to the old system. \n\nAnother thing I don't like is the cast indicator. It no longer shows the hit radius which is a small but non-negligible nerf to the Taliyah player as far as feedback goes. It makes it very difficult to gauge whether or not it will hit and thus reactively follow up with E.\n\nI think the changes were made with the right mindset (make the combo faster and easier to pull off, nerf damage to compensate), but I believe the execution has perhaps made this in fact less rewarding to the player than before.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Who is Taliyah","date":"2016-07-13T22:35:19.970+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":4,"body":"As a Taliyah main myself, currently 246k Mastery points.

You all act like vector casting takes a half second to set up, but within a game of play, you should easily get it down to < 1/4 sec.

This change will make it easier to shift from playing Viktor one game to Taliyah the next.  Taliyah's W would have been a vector cast from the start if literally any other Riot employee had made her.

I'm currently sitting t 90K champion points and rank 7. I put a lot of work into learning her, and was rewarded for it. Now with just one patch you have completely voided any experience Taliyah players have gained.\n\nWhile I do understand on some level, that if I learned her one way, I can learn her another as well, this is not what this is about. I'm not mad because I have to accept that my skill with her is now lowered because of this completely new mechanic added to her W, its that this new mechanic completely ruins her play style. I will gladly take that half second to recast W if it mean's I'll actually land it. Even in customs vs bots I could barely land a w itself, let alone successfully pull off a combo, where as last patch I was carrying games and earning S grades back to back.\n\nI think riot's head was in the right place with this change, but the execution was absolutely abysmally. I could happily play her 10 games back to back in 6.13, now I don't even like seeing other people play her because I know what a disadvantage they are now at because Riot gave into the demands of people who played 5 games with her and complained that the original double casting was hard, instead of actually taking time to learn her. \n\nAren't champions all supposed to feel unique and different from each other? Aren't you aiming to make a diverse game full of different kinds of play styles and mechanics? I could swear that's what you're always telling us, but then you just go copy and paste some Viktor code and call it a day.\n\nLike I'm actually ashamed that riot would give into demands of people that haven't even taken the time to understand her.\n\nI understand the spell lock affected her learning curve a bit, and honestly, it takes some getting used to but once you understand it, its not really as much of a hindrance as everyone seems to think. It was an aspect of her kit that needed some attention but really I could go either way on it. Keeping it intact makes her a bit more difficult to learn for some people, removing it makes her easier to play, but also gives her a new combo variation, which would cause her W, E, or both to get nerfed. That all fine, I could care less about it either way because spell locked or not, she's still my Taliyah. With this new mechanic on W, she is far from the Talliyah we all have come to know and love.\n\nFor example, Zyra's snare basically freezes her in place for the cast animation, Xerath and Jhin ults root them in place, Ahri has to get slightly out of her comfort zone to land charms occasionally, it's just a part of the game, people have learned that, and can now play around it, you didn't even give people that chance here. Many skills in league can have a risk/reward aspect and Taliyah was just another one of those people until you decided destroying her player base completely was a better choice than letting people actually learn her own unique playstyle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vexed Fate","date":"2016-07-14T05:59:23.525+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm agreeing with you guys here.

I CLIMBED FROM SILVER 4 to GOlD 1 - (into promos with her for plat) i litterally get screwed over to a rework that riot knows nothing about, listening to these so called \"taliyah players\" thinking they knew the champ. in my honest opinion if they want to catter to those people make it a option same with rumble to switch either or, from vector casting OR double tap casting. it should not be hard to do wit how good riot is at programming now compared to season 2...\n\n and i hope every single on of us messages them through support, telling them to look at this forum. i litterally love taliyah so much she made me get back into this game with how well they balanced a champion and made it really rewarding kit. please riot listen to the players who have played her more than 5 times. listen to the ones that played her and got so well with her that they actually enjoyed the kit you have given them in the beginning it was new and fresh of to bring, it was a learning curve the novice player wouldnt get until playing champs like {{champion:26}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:31}}  all these champions take skill to place knock ups, trajectory skill shots and more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Giraffestronaut","date":"2016-07-14T05:39:56.102+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot, for the love of god change it back.

I used to be able to do her combo a lot faster, but with the vector casting its all gone down the drain and I doubt I will play taliyah due to this. The problem here is making the champ \"more accessible\" we don't need more accessible champions as we already have plenty of broken champions that people already play. We need champions that require skill to play such as {{champion:92}} , {{champion:238}}  or {{champion:64}} to list a few.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PromptÃ¸","date":"2016-07-14T03:46:15.141+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"I absolutely hate this change, vector casts just don't feel right for this ability and break up the fun fast pace kite and disrupt playstyle that Taliyah had before this patch","replies":[]},{"poster":"RockUpper","date":"2016-07-14T07:53:07.611+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"I don't even consider myself a Taliyah main. I played her a fair amount before this patch, though, and after testing out the change I can say with the upmost certainty that vector cast does **not **work for her W. It's too precise a move to have that much commitment front-loaded onto it. Now instead of being a control mage (or disruptor, or whatever Riot wants to call her design) she's turning into a burst mage with her W being her single point of failure. The additional nerfs planned for next patch will tell you the direction this champ is heading, and I don't like it. The only thing I didn't like about her old w was the inability to cast summoner spells (namely flash) during the lockout. Everything else made perfect sense to me. A revert with summoner spells free would be amazing, but I'll take a full revert just as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FÃ¨rret","date":"2016-07-15T00:59:59.606+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"This vector cast thing should only be on Viktor and Rumble, leave my Talibae alone","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Iron LoliCon","date":"2016-07-14T13:56:40.086+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot kind of messed up big on this one.
