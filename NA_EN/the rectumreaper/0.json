An example is velkoz e vs. xerath q.  Xerath&#039;s q goes off if cast even if he dies instantly afterward and before the q damage even hits anything.  However, velkoz e winds up if he casts it and if he dies before it hits it dissipates into thin fuckin air.  Makes no sense to me.  There are other examples of this to.  The ability was cast and  it just disappears wtf is that.  it can actually make a pretty huge difference to for example when getting dove under tower and you need that extra bit of cc on someone to trade kills, or obviously to just win close team fights.  My question is Why is there no consistency on the matter??  Why not have all abilities disappear into wispy thin air or all abilities get cast in death?  Really irritating let me know what you think.","replies":[{"poster":"FantasySniper","date":"2015-10-18T22:20:45.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"If the ability is a projectile, assume it's going to disappear unless otherwise stated.\n\nIf the ability is instant application, it's going to do it anyways so long as they didn't die before they finished casting - because it's instant.\n\nXerath's [Q] is an instant AoE spell, but his [E] is a projectile.
