I mean at day one of the new systems release I noticed a lot of people just going with the \"screw it I am gonna get banned anyway so why bother!?!\" mentality. Perhaps it MIGHT be working its just taking time to clean out the large amount of ragers, trolls, and afkers. I mean lots of people play lol and have back up accounts as well so it takes time to weed them out.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheSaltyScourge","date":"2014-12-17T03:31:48.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The new afk system is shit. All it does is piss people off who play frequently that have a higher chance to dc at some point but still be penalized the same as someone who plays 1 game a day. If you ever dc more than once prepare ur anus for 5 minutes of waiting.{{champion:6}}","replies":[]}]}
