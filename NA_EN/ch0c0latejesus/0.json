You da man! I started playing Leona support because of the faster queue times and I've been playing support/jungle ever since. Playing support teaches you a LOT you can implement in other lanes and jungle. Like warding, freezing, setting up ganks, initiating fights and basic teamwork which I believe is heavily important in a game. I think if you ever want to be a better league player, learn support. I know sometimes you get very toxic and self involved ADCs but if you do manage to get an ADC with half a brain you'll find the experience a lot more enjoyable than other lanes. Of course in my opinion you should start with Leona as well. She's nice and tanky so you have a lot of survivability if you mess up. She's easy to learn. Her passive is great for support. Her W boost to your armor and MR is pretty neat. Her ultimate allows her to be pretty amazing in 5v5s and her initiate is a LOT of fun (read stun for days).\n\nTL; DR: Yes.

As a result, I'm finding an extraordinary amount of pleasure in supporting the hell out of my team :).\n\nTeam Builder is awesome for supports. \n\nProblem is, ranked games are different. \n\nSupports are forced to go bot lane with a player whose role pretty much forbids him from buying defensive items early. And also being particularly squishy, and most players (in lower elos) absolutely refuse to buy wards or even use their trinket.\n\nSo...yeah. Support mains have to deal with all kinds of toxicity in ranked. Partially because they are in lane with a player who feels unable to buy items necessary to protect himself, and rather relies entirely on the support to make up for his bad positioning or ridiculous ganking pressure from junglers like Rek'sai or Zac, and partially because the support is in the spotlight because they sit in lane with someone else who can watch and scrutinize them all game.\n\nSure, some supports can be toxic towards marskmen as well, but generally support _mains_ don't behave this way because A) they're used to supporting bad marskmen and B) they are usually genuinely good people that pick the role they picked because they like helping people in real life and they prefer the strategic map control vision game that supports play to the PVE last hit war of top, mid or marksmen.\n\nSo that's why support is a role people avoid like the plague in ranked.

Main reason for the duo bot lane in the first place is to help contest drag...but what if drag is already on timer?).\n\nYes, they are generally not powerful in the sense that they'll oneshot, destroy, pentakill, etc. the enemy team, but a lot of good supports can be used to cc and enemy to prevent the enemy from making a move (Thresh Q), heal your teammmates (Sona E and Soraka W), saving your teammates (Thresh W), pulling an enemy that's out of position for the team to kill (Blitz Q).\n\nIn the end, a good support is able to do a lot more than just feed the team's carry early game. In fact, some supports can go for a poke comp and decimate late-game, not all are \"weak\" (Lux support, Vel'koz support...while not necessarily \"meta\" picks, they can be insanely effective when played right).

Even a pure damage Mage builds items that add defensive stats.  Furthermore, this type of champion is intentionally handicapped (or so Riot says) so you must babysit them if you ever wanted them to be useful.\n\nYou must spend your hard earned gold on a subpar health item to provide vision for your lane.  Your lane buddy will then face check every bush that is not warded and your other teammates will not purchase their trinket upgrade.  They will also complain you don't have the entire map lit up, as if you actually could do that.\n\nYou cannot support anyone else because people and Riot expect the Support to solely babysit the Marksman.  Not a Marksman.  The Marksman.  The role that is always set in stone and subtly enforced by Riot Games.  Should you attempt to support someone else, maybe because you have a bad Bottom Lane Marksman, or an abusive one at that, your other three teammates will bitch and moan about the person who Refuses to Communicate.\n\n--------\n\nAs for your question, Zwill, new players start out playing the game as an aggressive, Creep Scoring, type of person.  They don't get taught how to support anyone, and for a long time, they will simply be sharing the lane, rather than supporting anything (The fifth player who would've been the jungler does the exact same thing at Top Lane).\n\nYou don't really find many Support _Mains_ at the lower leagues for this exact reason.  You find people who end up as Supports, though.\n\nAnd why?  The Support role is ALL and ONLY about babysitting someone for the first half of the game, 99.9999% of the time a Marksman.  The second half of the game, they hang around the team and don't really do much else outside team fights.  The only Supports I see that might not have a Marksman as their lane buddy are pre-made groups.  Why?  Because people bitch if this is not the case.  I don't care how much you push the \"don't report for off meta\" stipulation, people whine and moan if the support does not fulfill these things and babysits the Bot Lane Marksman.\n\nThee role itself is pretty damn mundane for anyone who is not a true, blue, dedicated support main.  Simply put, it's not very fun to rely on passive gold income and babysit a person who is more often than not, stupid AND deliberately fragile.  Getting yelled at and harassed for not building specific items or lighting up the whole map is not something people like.  Support is like a damned minigame in the game.\n\nI don't care how it's done, but I'll take damage reductions across the board on the Support role if I could influence other lanes, or provide map pressure, or long range utility.  I'd be even more happy if the Sightstone was considered an Essential/Recommended item for EVERY champion.  Sightstone roaming bruiser or supportive Marksman my foot.  Sightstone Teemo ... Do people realize some \"Supports\" (official, \"meta\", or off meta) are so squishy that if they go near ward dropping range, they can be insta-gibbed, even with a Sightstone?

I wish it did, but I honestly think there's some major turn offs to playing support that need to be addressed first. I say this being a support main (I have over 1000 games played as Janna).\n\n I'd like to see sightstone have some serious work done on it, and maybe even combining it with the GP5 items, especially if you're going to make the second ward upgrade automatic in the future. I think part of what personally turns me off to playing support is having to invest so much gold into sight stone and my GP5 before I can ever build anything else. \n\nPossible Solutions:\nCombine sightstone with the GP5 Line\nAllow Sightstone Upgrades ONLY if you have a completed Gp5 item (to prevent other lanes from abusing it)\nRevamp the sightstone line to have AP, Health, AD, etc upgrades.\nAllow Sightstone to be an upgrade from the trinket line.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PoisonedPeace","date":"2015-07-17T23:38:07.269+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that it will encourage players to play carry supports that aren't really supports because they just want to get into a ranked game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XxxLumberJackxxX","date":"2015-07-17T23:14:19.091+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"TBH i dont think it's an issue of the number of people per roll.

I can completely see teams kicking people for not choosing LCS/meta picks and all other manner of ridiculousness. \n\nThat being said I don't think the problem being tough is any excuse for Riot not to fix it.
