It is possible to proc thunderlords&#039;s with a single W cast, as long as at least 3 rockets hit the target, making his early poke hit extremely hard even with only 1 point in the ability.\r\n\r\nMy understanding of thunderlord&#039;s is that it is meant to complement combo casters and assassins who rapidly use a full rotation of spells on one target. Right now it complements almost  _everything_ due to how easy it is to proc on nearly every champ. I even saw a {{champion:75}} using it, who was perfectly able to proc thunderlord&#039;s with a single spiritfire, as long as I took 3 ticks of damage from it.\r\n\r\nSeems like common sense that thunderlord&#039;s should only get one stack with any given ability cast, even if the ability can hit multiple times. This would at least help push it back into its niche of combo casters, rather than being a practical pick on everything.","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2016-01-07T19:12:05.109+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thunderlord's should just make it so all of the champion's abilities apply a stack of Lightning to the target for X seconds, occurring once per ability cast. \nBasic attacks apply a stack as an on-attack/on-hit effect.\n\nEnemies with 3 stacks of Lightning will proc Thunderlord's Decree.","replies":[{"poster":"Gubaguy","date":"2016-01-07T19:21:40.053+0000","up_votes":45,"down_votes":1,"body":"you literally jsut described kennen's entire kit.","replies":[{"poster":"TaoistMaster","date":"2016-01-08T13:52:53.070+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"thunder.. electricity\n\nmakes sense to me","replies":[{"poster":"Gubaguy","date":"2016-01-08T18:34:50.601+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder\n\nBasic science lesson for you, first sentence \"thunder is the sound caused by lightning\"","replies":[{"poster":"TheI3igDaddy","date":"2016-01-09T07:11:30.114+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blame Pokemon for giving the names 'Thunderbolt' and 'Thunder' to lightning attacks.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"RISE Shlack123","date":"2016-01-07T23:51:19.148+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm pretty tired of the League of Thunderlords, personally.
