Generally this comes in the form of a &quot;minigame&quot; or some random thing forced into their kit that makes no sense thematically or balance wise.   A good example being {{champion:114}} with a random aoe heal on an assassin, tank, fighter, adc, hypercarry. (I guess she needed a support ability too)\n\nConsidering this, their rework to {{champion:96}}  was all the more perplexing. They basically stripped him down to his W, raising his mana costs in a further attempt to make sure everything is centered around his W. His entire &quot;identity&quot; is that he can attack really fast and it looks kind of funny.\n\nHe predictably turned out to be s**t as a result of his terrible numbers.\n\nWell, they finally buffed him, by adjusting his numbers and scalings to allow for more diverse strategies and builds, and.....\n\nOh, no actually they just buffed his W again.\n\nNow he&#039;s strong! Of course, because they moved the passive attack speed bonus from his Q to his W. Now there is zero reason to level anything else. He is even more linear, and he now gets strong a lot faster because he gets a f**kton of stats from leveling one skill. Base attack speed, range, on-hit damage, along with the huge attack speed steroid.\n\nRiot, really, honestly, in all seriousness, just fire your current balance team, or move them to another department at the very least.\n\nPeople dont like the direction the game is going. They dont like the changes being made to the champs they spent time mastering.

But secondly... why are we giving Burst Damage to a Shen, to an Engage Tank?\n\nAnd while I do like the CONCEPT of the Dodge, and the Dodge replaces his weakest Ability in an AP Ratio Shield (the one thing that could have been changed and made sense) they did it all wrong by (1) making it in an AoE Area tied to another Ability and (2) having it affect his Allies.\n\nAlso, you have 0 Ranked Games as Shen in Season 6... so what exactly is your experience on Shen?  You have 0 Ranked Games on Shen in Season 5 as well, so not sure how you are able to compare Season 5 Shen to Season 6 Shen, unless you're just spewing something you've read from somewhere.

His old Q was always problematic in the laning phase because it functioned effectively as free harass on a tank that also allowed you to sustain off hitting the enemy target, which gave you health in addition to your shield and AA damage reduction of your enemies via your taunt - all of which you could use by landing your taunt on 1 enemy. This meant that when he's allowed to be really strong, odds are very high that (outside of competitive play where 2v1 lanes can occur) you don't get to beat him in lane, you only ever get to hope to stalemate with him if he's any good, and in the situation of stalemate, that means you're actually losing because of the global pressure he can exert just by existing with his ult. \n\nOne thing I've learned on the boards is that one person talking about his main can make anyone sound like they have boundless strategic depth, and that perspective from people that aren't mains of that champion is necessary to prevent senseless fawning over the perceived complexity of the champion (I can talk your head off about a lot of the strategic interplay of Fizz, for example, but other people will boil him down to his basest elements while I try to discuss it, and often for good reason). If we're being entirely realistic, outside of Shen's ult, he was a decidedly simple champion. The most important thing that separated a bad Shen and a good Shen were game sense - when to ult, who to ult, and if the ult would be worth any potential cost at wherever you left from. And that kind of macro-decision-making wasn't even unique to Shen. \n\nAs to why they might give him an empowered spot: a common theme among tanks is something called 'zone control.' They gave that to him in an area that exists beyond his E cooldown now. If an enemy auto-attacker is going for an ally, congratulations, you can actually help them while your E is on cooldown instead of hoping the enemy auto-attacker is stupid enough to attack a Shen with no taunt to make you. That's kind of important against someone like Draven or Vayne or Koggy or Yi or Xin Zhao, whose primary damage comes in the form of auto-attacks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RG Velean","date":"2016-02-25T15:13:11.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've never played Shen in ranked, no, but i have played the two different iterations of the Champion and I have enjoyed both. \n\nBefore he wasn't as strategic because he was point and click with his Q and his W was a self shield. Now you have to properly position yourself in order to be the most effective that you can. The concept behind your Q is not to build damage, you even said it, you're an Engage Tank, so you build tank items. His Q simply gives you empowered autos, so if you build straight tank, then you can deal some damage as well and survive it.\n\nAlso, the rework given to Shen was not meant to keep him as an Engage tank, it was meant to make him more of a brawler than anything (granted building titanic hydra on him is a little broken) Your W is castable where ever the Blade is, moving it through enemies allows you to deal your max damage during a trade due to the slow caused if they run away.\n\nThe Dodge was made the way it was because Shen was being seen in a support role moreso than anything. He didn't have great teamfighting in Season 6 due to his single target damage and sustain. Now he has an AoE dodge that makes him and his team stronger. Now granted, him not having any kind of sustain in lane sucks, but now he has a greater late game impact (in my opinion) . Also, I like that you pulled that I have 0 ranked games with him in either season as if only ranked is available to play. \n\nI, personally, enjoy the new Shen and find him fun to play, as well as I did the old Shen. Now you just have to be a little bit more strategical with your positioning (not only of you but also your blade) instead of how you should use your Q.

In patch 5.18, I remember him being played 91% of the time in toplane (from champion.gg). The rest of the time was pretty much only support (I remember this because I looked at item purchase rates for him because I was trying to learn shen, and jungle items and smite had less than a 2% buy/pick rate on him).\n\nFor comparison data, Shen is being played as a top laner 78.9% of the time right now (according to champion.gg). That means that he's being played 21.1% of the time in roles that are not top lane. I would assume jungle and support are the other roles he's doing right now, but that's just because I haven't seen many Shen mids or ADCs yet.\n \nI never saw any evidence of him being seriously played as a jungler past around season 2 or so (and even then it was rare), and I can't find any records of him being played as a jungler in professional games anytime recently. That may just be due to my ineptitude at searching for that data, so if you have evidence of that, I'd happily take a look at it.\n\n>he had no issue being viable Pre-Rework. He didn't need a Buff to Jungle,\n\nIf you go by play rates and competitive pick rates, yes he did. He wouldn't die to the jungle, but he was absurdly slow and easy to bully, and that made him weak. You could technically do it, but in the same way I could technically jungle with Ashe or that I could technically go mid as Nami. It was generally considered a bad pick, even if you didn't automatically lose by doing it.\n\nI really don't have much more to say about that. Shen jungle was bad. He's better at jungling now than he was back then, just because he isn't so ungodly slow. They're not buffing his jungling now to put it on the level of old Shen's jungling.

Tanks in general should be able to be Kited.  He already has a Gap Closer to help negate this in his Taunt, which he already had... so why are we adding MORE ways for a Tank to avoid Kite?\n\nSecondly, his Q moves his Blade... so his W (Dodge) requires the AoE, but his Q has to be moved and the tether hit the Champion to draw the Slow and get that extra Damage.  The tether is centered on the Blade, which is the middle of the Q... so saying his Q doesn't require the AoE is a bit silly, because moving the AoE is half of the Q... it just happens.\n\nSo we are right back to a Global Presence being tied down to a Local Tether again.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Spoofghoul","date":"2016-02-24T21:50:38.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea because resourceless ranged harras is so healthy *cough*{{champion:238}} *cough*","replies":[{"poster":"KillerKell","date":"2016-02-28T20:31:02.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

If the ONLY thing you were doing was Ranged Harass, you were missing out on 2/3rd of his Q's Potency.  As a Champion facing an Old Shen I WANTED the Q to hit me, so I could back out until the Sustain was off and continue farming with no issues while he flailed around missing CS since he wasn't last hitting with Q or pushing wave with Q.\n\n3.  Riot deems (their opinion) Zed to be Healthy, which is why he doesn't get hard nerfed or reworked... yet they rework Shen who only has one part of the unhealthy Zed Aspect in the form of Low Energy Ranged Harass.  So in effect they Reworked something they themselves consider to be healthy and perfectly fine on a Champion like Zed, who despite not being a Tank is still some how more safe than Shen.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Restless Slumber","date":"2016-02-24T14:00:09.467+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"My favorite ADC's before the preseason were Jinx and Kog'Maw.
