A Kench even without items can fuck you up royally thanks to the damage on his W, and base damage on his Q and ult.\n\n4.)

He still gets to AA and deal damage, AND youre team is fighting a 4v5 until Devour ends.

You get LW for any tank, this doesnt suddenly mean more to Kench than it does to Mundo, or to another tank.\n\nThe only one of those changes that would effect top kench would be the Ration on his Q. being able to QSS sounds great, until you realize you take the damage from the skill regardless of if you QSS it.\n\nPretty much no change to fix Kench wont effect both roles.
