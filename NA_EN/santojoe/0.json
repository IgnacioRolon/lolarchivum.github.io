Kennen & Gnar.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":23,"down_votes":8,"body":"Hello:\n\nFirst of all, my profile: http://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=santojoe\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDVUUxJxJyOWlWL8O8TfZUw\n\nI&#039;m one of those who likes playing Teemo, sorry, it&#039;s one of my favourite champions. But, he has no place in the current game.\n\nLooking at other yordles/champions, there is nothing he can do **effectively** in order to be picked instead of other champions.\n\nWhat is Teemo&#039;s job?\nI think it&#039;s making top lane hard for some melee in the early game (despite what people think, Teemo can&#039;t counter Nasus/Garen/Darius/etc in the mid-late game) and help the team with awesome map control using his ulti, or use it to push/def a lane.\n\nIt sounds really cool, it&#039;s like \"you can counter some champs in the early game, and, even if you are not very good at teamfights, you can help a lot with your ulti for map control and for pushing lanes you are not in\".\n\nBut in the game, in particular, at \"high elo\", that Teemo is usually, useless. \n\nAA range: 500, almost every gap closer that most meta champions have has more range than 500, so it&#039;s hard to even counter the early game of those champs.\n\nQ: really strong, 680 range, enough for harrasing enemy laner but too risky for trying to blind the enemy adc during teamfights. Almost no counterplay.\n\nW: No real scape, and the cd on his \"scape/chase ability\" is too long, 17 seconds cd.\n\nE: It&#039;s not a bad design, I think it should be reworked, it should have stacks. Due to the low AA range and no sustain/scape/survival skills, Teemo is better at building \"mage\" than AS+AP. In my experience, I have seen that is better, in teamfights or even in lane, attacking the enemy with AA+Q and run away with W, than building AS+AP and staying at 500 range for more AAs, it&#039;s too risky, and it doesn&#039;t really rewards you (30% AP on hit, and 40% DoT poison damage that doesn&#039;t stack).\n\nR: Amazing spell. It&#039;s why I like Teemo (well, one of the reasons). But it has 2 main problems:\n\n1- If the enemy is \"new to the game\" or he doens&#039;t know there are some objects like Banshee&#039;s Veil, or Vision lens, he will see how OP this ulti is, and in fact, it&#039;s too powerfull if you don&#039;t know how to counter it. It can deal easily 40-60% hp to a squishy, depending on how fed Teemo is, and on Liandry&#039;s Torment (the item has amazing synergy with the ulti). Which is, in my opinion, **OverPowered**, and not fun to play against.\n\n2- Once you learn that there are some items like Zhonyas/Banshee&#039;s Veil/pink wards/Vision Lens/etc. You realize how easy is to counter this ulti. And, if you are a tank with a lot of MR, you can easily \"eat\" some mushrooms if you have banshee&#039;s Veil or lens on cd without taking too much damage, countering the \"map-control\" Teemo has. Which is, in my opinion, **NERFED**, and not fun to play with.\n\n**As we can see, it&#039;s strong versus lack of knowledge and too useless versus experienced players. How to solve it?.**\n\nMake the mushrooms totally invisibles, even if you use vision lens, you won&#039;t see them.\n\nBut this is too op dude, stop dreaming.\n\nOf course, change the damage they can deal. For example:\n\nNoxious Trap\nTeemo places a trap which stealths and arms in 1 second. It detonates if an enemy steps on it, dealing 14% /17% /20% (+0,75% per 100 ability power) target maximum health as magic damage and poisoning nearby enemies, slowing them by 30% / 40% / 50% for 4 seconds. The traps last 10 minutes. Teemo will store one every 35 / 31 / 27 seconds, and can have a maximum of three stocked up. Each cast requires and uses a trap. After death, you respawn with 2 mushrooms.\n\nNumbers are subject to changes of course, it&#039;s just an example of how it would work in order to avoid OP situations (a LB is walking and suddenly his HP drops from 100% to 40% and she doesn&#039;t know why), but at the same time, enemy team has to be careful about Teemo&#039;s map control, it would be a strong ultimate on champion who is supposed to be good at taking control of objectives and warding key places. At the moment, it&#039;s just \"Oh, they have a Teemo, build Vision lens and pink wards, and let the tank be the first\".** I&#039;m ok with Vision Lens as long as it doesn&#039;t counter so hard the only strong point of a champion ** because Teemo is not strong in teamfighst clearly, and his laning phase depends on what the enemy team choose (it&#039;s not like Maokai/Irelia/Hecarim/etc).\n\nWhy did I mention Kennen and Gnar?\n\nBecause at the moment, there is no reason you pick Teemo in a game in which Kennen and Gnar are not banned. They do the same as Teemo does in lane (make it hard for some champion) but in a better way, they don&#039;t use mana, they have better sustain, they have gap closer-scape, they have cc, Kennen has 550 just with AAs, the rest of the skills has more range. MiniGnar has low AA range but it&#039;s compensated by a long poking tool on Q and an amazing scape skill on E.\n\nAnd in top of that, they are extremely strong during teamfights, Gnar is just a stun-beast during tfs, and kennen with his ulti can change the whole game.\n\nThen, what is Teemo&#039;s difference with Kennen and Gnar?, they have better laning phase, they are much better at tfs, they don&#039;t need mana.\n\n**MAP CONTROL, Teemo can offer map control, the problem is that it&#039;s easily 100%-countered by some items and with the new SR, the monster that is walking on the river.**\n\nI&#039;m fine with Kennen and Gnar, I play them sometimes, but Teemo needs some changes, in particular, with the ulti, and how it interacts with some items.\n\nI would like to buy the legendary skin that is gonna be out on the next patch, but I don&#039;t want to buy something for a champion that I can&#039;t use versus experienced players, because it doesn&#039;t depend on how good I&#039;m using the ulti, it depends on when enemy team buy pinkwards/banshee&#039;s veil/vision lens.\n\nNot fun.","replies":[{"poster":"UdoIkOSc4u","date":"2015-04-06T12:45:45.353+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":14,"body":"riot thinks teemo hasn't clear strenght and weakness but they believe that overloaded champions like {{champion:150}} and{{champion:64}} are healthy","replies":[{"poster":"SantoJoe","date":"2015-04-06T12:53:23.674+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teemo's strong points: Lack of knowledge in the enemy team.\n\nTeemo's weak points: Hard cc, gap closers, long range (everything above 500 range), Teamfights, Laners with sustain, Banshee's Veil, Pink ward, Vision Lens, Tanks, Mikael.

Teemo can store a mushroom once every 35 seconds at this level, so, the enemy team can destroy every single mushroom around mid/dragon at this level, also, the river monster can destroy them for them. Also, what makes Teemo's ultimate so dangerous is its synergy with Liandry's Torment, if you are jungling, you need to build first the jungle item and the boots in order to effectively gank/map control. So at this level you won't have enough damage for your mushrooms to be a real problem for the enemy team, and by the time you get your liandry's torment, enemy team can get improved Vision lens.\n\n> \n> He can counter jungle by using his passive to get the jump\n\nYou will have to wait sometimes a lot, Teemo jungler or whatever is not good because his utility but because his damage (in ganks), if you lose too much time trying to countergank someone, you are losing gold, if you lose gold, you can't compensate it with your utility. Also, we are taking into account that this is pre lvl 9 with no pink ward in the enemy team, because your passive can be detected.\n\n>  or smite steal, \n\nDue to the smite range, you should be pretty close to dragon/baron, and I have not seen a single enemy team that don't use Vision Lens + pink ward near an important objective for vision clearing (wards, mushrooms, etc), so you should be detected before them starting the dragon/baron, I don't think this situation is real tbh.\n\n\n> he can gank by sneaking into lane and attacking at the right moment. \n\nYou should clear first the wards from the enemy, and then, wait some time for the enemy laner/s to come for warding the bush again or letting them pushing a lot.

So at this level you won't have enough damage for your mushrooms to be a real problem for the enemy team, and by the time you get your liandry's torment, enemy team can get improved Vision lens.\n\n> A good lane Teemo can pull that kind of thing off as well, but the jungle Teemo won't make the cs in mid be wasted while he roams.  I wouldn't say he is best in the jungle, but he can be a good opportunity pick.\n\nAlso, he can be counterjungled in the early game easily, which means you are not gonna be able to help your team, and in top of that, you need blue buff, so you'll have to help a lot your mid laner in case theirs has blue.\n\nThe problem is what I said at the beggining. Too op versus unexperienced players (mushrooms everywhere because no Vision Lens - Pink Wards /etc), too useless versus experienced players.","replies":[{"poster":"Baron of Bread","date":"2015-04-07T20:57:36.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">You can be counterjungled in the early game, which means you are gonna need help for clearing the camps because the enemy will be there.\n\nDid you know that many of the highest win-rate junglers are weak to early counterjungling?  That is the biggest weakness shared among tank junglers and they are doing fine.  Teemo doesn't scale the same way they do but he can keep them in constant fear of stepping on a shroom and thus skrew up their mid/early game.\n\n>The lane should be so pushed that any other champ with no-jungler-role could do the same thing.\n\nYes, it would be so pushed that any non-jungler with cc can gank.  Which isn't all that pushed.  Either way, I did point out your ability to countergank which you ignored.  Teemo is faster than other junglers so he responds faster and with shrooms he usually knows when they are coming earlier as well.  He might not get the kill, but he will ruin any attempts at ganking by the enemy.\n\n>Smite on wraths + pink wards + Vision lens (pre-9). Teemo can store a mushroom once every 35 seconds at this level, so, the enemy team can destroy every single mushroom around mid/dragon at this level, also, the river monster can destroy them for them.\n\nDid you know that shrooms can be placed outside of the river?  It's true, you don't need them planted near water.  Joking aside, yes the birds and pink wards and vision lenses will allow the enemy team to destroy shrooms.  However, they have to know where the shrooms are before they can sweep for them.  If they aren't sweeping every step they take they are likely to step on a shroom if you place them carefully.  Even if they somehow miraculously sweep out every shroom they will have used every vision denying tool at their disposal, leaving your wards intact.  If they don't take out your wards they will be seen before they gank, take objectives, or roam.  It's a win-win situation for you.\n\n>Also, what makes Teemo's ultimate so dangerous is its synergy with Liandry's Torment, if you are jungling, you need to build first the jungle item and the boots in order to effectively gank/map control.

The only thing it gives is the AP and CDR, no increased gold from camps.  If you would rather have Liandry's stats before Magus's there is no reason to buy Magus first.\n\n>you need blue buff, so you'll have to help a lot your mid laner in case theirs has blue.\n\nNot every mid laner needs blue buff.  As I said, Teemo is an opportunity jungler.  You don't pick him in every situation and he doesn't dominate in every situation.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Occams Raiser","date":"2015-04-07T08:00:45.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teemo should be able to stealth like Eve if he stands still but then be able to move without breaking it.If had speed and stealth he would be nice But not be able to stealth like Twitch to run away.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Leblancs Boob","date":"2015-04-07T17:19:30.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teemo's kit is just way too unhealthy to be buffed in its current state.

Anyways, I consider Scouting as something Junglers and Supports do the most.

Also, other problem is that Mushrooms scalling is really poor (50% of your AP) so you need the help Liandry's Torment can offer. **More AP scalling = Less damage done from Liandry's**. I liked the idea of max health damage because without Liandry's torment or max Hp % a tank is sometimes inmune to mushrooms.\n\n > His on-hit e needs a slight buff to get his sustained damage closer to a typical marksman.  (His Q equals one crit, but then his damage is over after his auto-Q-auto.)\n\nAt the moment, if you land 1 AA, you are dealing: AA damage + 170 magic damage + 70% of your AP, during 4 seconds. It's like a single target spell from a normal mage, which is not bad, the problem is the range, too low and too risky, 500. They should increase the range (as we said above) and at the same time, give stacks to the DoT part of the skill. In that way, you could be rewarded if you decide to stay close to the enemy and stacking some shots. Also, it would support AS+AP Teemo.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2015-04-07T13:47:34.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, I can see you're from EUW.

Make it so that there isn't as much reason to spam a ton of shrooms in one place\n\nMushrooms only refresh the DoT, it's a bad idea to place them near each other, so, at the moment, they are not being used like that, at least, a normal Teemo shouldn't be using the ulti in that way.\n\n> If you nerfed the damage and slightly increased their vision radius it would be better, and I also think it would be cool if the DoT aspect of his shrooms worked like Liandry's and burned for % current health\n\nOk, improve the vision Teemo can offer, while lowering the damage?, I don't get the point on how this could make Teemo more viable.\n\n>This would prevent the toxic behavior where teemo spams shrooms all over your jungle and if you go in without a pink they destroy you.\n\nLet's see that situation, he can store 3 at the same time, if it's your jungle, he can't stay forever in it, so he will use 3 I think. That's, if you are going without pink/vision lens?, your team should have usually 2-3 vision lens + a couple of pinks, if you go to your jungle where you know Teemo has placed some mushrooms, it's not \"Toxic's behavior\", it's just that your team is not playing according to the enemy strategy.\n\n> With these changes you still should get pinks against teemo because otherwise his team will have vision of you, but if you don't get a pink you're not instantly dead, just softened up.\n\n\"if you don't have vision\", In which situation your team could have a lack of vision-lens/pink wards and at the same time, being in a place where Teemo has used a lot of mushrooms?, It's a very extrange situation, anyways, you could use the Banshee's Veil or your tank in order to avoid them.\n\n \n> tldr: True sight must reveal his ult, but changing the way it deals damage and increasing the vision is provides would make it less toxic\n\nSo, your solution for making Teemo viable is:\n\n1- Make their mushrooms like wards.\n2- Reduce the damage he can deal.\n\nSorry but I don't think this is a good solution. We want a viable Teemo, not Veigar's compensantion buffs.","replies":[]}]}]}
