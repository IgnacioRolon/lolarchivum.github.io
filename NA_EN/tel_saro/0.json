Since returning, I have noticed that snowballing seems to be at a level I haven&#039;t seen in years.\r\n\r\nIn many games, if a lane gets even a single kill early it&#039;s pretty much over. That lane then snowballs and there isn&#039;t much hope for the player who died to make a comeback.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on this?","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-11-30T13:38:58.557+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, certainly some games feel like stomps but no where near as bad as last preseason with the 25 min games.  That was snowballing out of control.

But individual lane snowball is real. It just seems the ability to carry off of your won lane isn't enough and is becoming even more team oriented which is good and bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Poske","date":"2016-11-30T13:36:22.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was a time when snowball was out of control","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2016-11-30T12:31:53.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Okay that's fine, downvote me for making an obvious point that disagrees with you. \n\nA \"snowballing\" champion is designed to have significant power spikes by out-leveling their opponent. These are more often \"mid game\" champions because as long as they are able to gain an early level advantage they can beat their enemies before they reach the level cap and their opponent is able to catch up. \n\nThe alternatives are \"early game\" champions and \"late game\" champions. Early game champions are more often able to bully mid game champions which keeps them from getting out of control. They have higher base stats and do not scale as well. Late game champions are more often item dependent. If they can survive long enough they will most likely be the strongest. \n\nAnd of course with 134 available champions, it is ridiculous to attempt to divide all of them up into 3 categories. Many champions have differing degrees of strength during each phase of the match. Some scale consistently throughout the whole match, others are early and mid, some are mid and late, others are early and late. Furthermore the outcome of any given match is even more difficult to be determined when a team is comprised of a combination of 5 of the aforementioned snowflakes (no pun intended, ... well, maybe a little intended), and then there is the actual knowledge and skill of the person sitting on the other side of the keyboard. \n\nSo in summary, any champion who is infact \"snowballing\" will be \"out of control\" until they are no longer \"snowballing\"","replies":[{"poster":"Tel Saro","date":"2016-11-30T12:51:45.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that snowball champs have always existed, but what I'm talking about is not about a single champ or group of champs.\n\n It's about every single game feeling very very feast or famine. Regardless of champion roster, games seem to be detrmined in the first 5-10mins.\n\nIn the past, it has felt like if I had a poor start I could play safe, farm up, and my team would still have a shot mid to late as long as we didn't yield too many objectives. \n\nCurrently it feels like one mistake and the game is no longer winnable.\n\nThis isn't just about losing. I have had plenty of matches were I got a kill early and that lane was pretty much over. \n\nI see this mostly in the bot lane now, but it applies to all lanes. \n\nI'm not complaining about specific champions designed to snowball.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2016-11-30T12:16:21.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, that is kinda how snowballing is supposed to work ...","replies":[{"poster":"Tel Saro","date":"2016-11-30T12:21:08.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Elite4Runner,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=hgMqAX71,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-11-30T12:16:21.259+0000)\n>\n> Well, that is kinda how snowballing is supposed to work ...\n\nI think you are missing the point.\n\nI'm asking if other players feel that snowballing has become a big problem, not what the definition of snowballing is.\n\nThanks for your useless post though.\n\nRiot has always attempted to reduce snowballing because it isn't healthy for the game.
