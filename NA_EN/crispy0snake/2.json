{"poster":"Crispy0Snake","date":"2018-04-17T16:25:12.973+0000","title":"Brand's base damage is too high","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":84,"down_votes":17,"body":"Simply that. His damage is higher than most midlaners across the board. Pillar of flame has such a large AOE that it is impossible to dodge so when you go to cs he&#039;ll just EW for 50% of your hp. The only skillshot is his Q which pretty much guarantees a kill if he lands it. I&#039;ve tried shoving, freezing and letting the wave crash under turret, I&#039;ve tried short trades and long trades, I cannot win lane against him.\n\nYou can argue his AP scaling is lower but his passive does %max health damage so he has good scaling there.\n\nTL; DR His base damage is far too high and that damage is far too easy to get off\n\nEdit: I am talking about Brand mid, however I am a support main, and everything I have said here applies there too. Also any mid with a mobility spell should be okay, but when I mid I play Ryze/Syndra so maybe that's where I'm going wrong\n\nAlso people say his W is easy to dodge... wat. Have you not seen how wide his W is? Syndra can hit Q's that have a similar delay and they are much smaller AOE's, so Brand can definitely hit his W on someone 90% of the time. Saying \"Just dodge a massive AOE spell, it's easy\" is really quite silly\n\nJust to demonstrate the point of the damage he deals: \n\nSyndra Q: 50 / 95 / 140 / 185 / 230 (+ 65% AP) \n\nBrand W: 75 / 120 / 165 / 210 / 255 (+ 60% AP) (Non empowered. Also this is a much larger AOE ability and will add a stack of his passive to a target)\n\nMeaning Brand W does as much damage as Syndra Q when Syndra has 500 more AP than Brand. Disclaimer: I know Syndra has more mana at all levels and her Q costs 20 less mana cross the board but as long as you don't wiff abilities as Brand you'll deal more damage than a mage mid as mage support. Also Brand support gets bonus mana regen from Spellthief's and Frostfang.","replies":[{"poster":"webstar1108","date":"2018-04-17T16:54:42.803+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":4,"body":"Brand mid gets destroyed by some other mages and the AD mids are pretty good against him too.
