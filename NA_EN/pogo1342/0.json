My friend sent me a link to get free rp. I was pretty confident it was fake but I still clicked on it like a dumbass. That link brought me to a page that didn't even work. A few days later I log in to find a lot of my friends telling me I was hacked. Somebody sent that like to every single one of my contacts. I changed my password and typed back to every single contact jus to make sure none of my friends clicked on it. I'm not sure if changing my password is enough or not . If there's anything riot can do please help lmao. My friend told me I should contact you guys just in case so hi. Help. Please .","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-21T03:05:02.856+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oooooh gosh....phishing websites are no good =( . I'm sorry that happened to you, and in the future remember that we don't do RP giveaways like that, so any suspicious links are most likely malicious. If you're still concerned about the safety of your account, I'd suggest hitting us up through the [**account recovery form**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) just in case!","replies":[{"poster":"Pogo1342","date":"2017-05-21T03:12:00.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok thank you I definitely will fill that out. thank you","replies":[]}]}]}
