The three shards I used were dunkmaster darius, gentleman chogath and project yi. The permanent I received was hextech big bad warwick, not a legendary. I'm wondering why I didn't get a permanent legendary because I wouldn't have rerolled them if I knew I would get that crusty skin. I would have used my orange essance to make them permanents. I spent like $70+ dollars already on this game and I have not had any problems except this. I don't know where else I'm supposed to report this incident so I'm just gunna put it here. Can anyone help or explain this to me?","replies":[{"poster":"Lew","date":"2016-12-30T00:07:30.699+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"When they say type I think that means same type of shard, so 3 skin shards get you a random permanent skin or 3 ward shards will turn into a random new permanent ward after re-rolling.  The quality of the skins used in the re-rolls doesn't matter at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Pogo1342","date":"2016-12-30T03:17:57.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":":( thanks tho lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-30T00:49:22.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you get from a reroll is essentially *random* just like the loot you get out of chests and any other reroll, regardless of the value of rarity of the shard. It totally sucks that you didn't get a really good permanent out of this reroll, but the silver lining is you now know that everything is essentially RNG. I'd recommend disenchanting any unwanted high-value skins since they yield more essence than others.\n\nCheck out our [**Hextech Crafting Guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide) for more info on the system and let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Pogo1342","date":"2016-12-30T03:17:07.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks sigh","replies":[]}]}]}
