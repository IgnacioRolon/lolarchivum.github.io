It doesn't care what you use.\n\nFor skins you can argue never to reroll as you have no control on what you end up getting. By saving up and disenchanting you at least have a say when you finally get something desirable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-24T02:58:48.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just save them for essense, disenchant as needed. Rerolls will mostly get you shit.\n\nIn the long run, getting a few skins you actually want is better. Maybe reroll with very low-price skins only.\n\nRerolling spirit guard udyr would also be some sort of heresy, or at least a giant middle finger to the favor of RNG.","replies":[]}]}
