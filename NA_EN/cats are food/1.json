It helps that Reddit is weird at this time of night, and I can&#039;t sleep.\n--------------------------------------------\n**Sylas - The Vintage Player&#039;s Dream**\n\nPro: \nWhy do I call him that? Because we have a lot of experience with all of the ultimates. We&#039;ve tinkered around with, played with, and abused ultimates from the original 40 until now.  Myself, even on this account, I&#039;m at least Mastery 4 with every champion on the roster.\n\nGod it will be fun with a cherry picking of ults every game.\n\nCon: \nHe adds damage onto a lot of ults that shouldn&#039;t really HAVE damage.  At least when those champions are played how they are meant to be.  Their scaling is intense for precisely this reason, and Sylas is simply designed to abuse the holy hell out of this.\n\n\n**Sylas - Yet Another AOE Burster**\n\nPro:\nWave clear is going to be easy, and his farm is very likely to be intense every game.  Split pushing will be masterful, with ease.\n\nCon: \nYeah, just what the game needed.  More AOE burst.\n\n\n**Sylas - The Jack Of All Trades**\n\nPro:\nWith his ability to snag ults, namely those that make you tougher, he will be able to gap fill pretty much anything his team needs simply by jacking the ultimate from specific champions.  Need a tanky champ? Steal from Jax or Cho.  Need more damage? Steal Zed&#039;s.\n\nCon:\nThis will make him either a solid ban, or a solid pick, in every single game until he&#039;s nerfed into oblivion.  The last thing players want is a functional 5v6 mechanics wise.\n------------------------------\nAll in all he seems like he is a fun concept, but he&#039;s right down the same path RIOT has mindlessly carved for the past few years. He is a champion who can &#039;do it all&#039; while still killing your team.\n\nBut the biggest Pro of all? Imma Veigar ult a Veigar.","replies":[{"poster":"hotarse","date":"2019-01-11T10:52:19.635+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":"You're doing this wrong:\nPro:\nCon: Sylas","replies":[]},{"poster":"7deadLeeSlnz","date":"2019-01-11T14:48:43.580+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"You can not really make a reliable list in such a short time period.

Giving one champion access to over 140 abilities is going to make for ridiculously high inconsistency, which is going to be a balancing nightmare. To make up for this he needs to be either very self sufficient without his ultimate counting for the times whatever ultimates he steals will be trash, OR he has to be nerfed into the ground accounting for the three or four ultimates he can use which synergize with his kit way too well.

Enemy team firstpicks Sylas? Don't pick Malphite or Sejuani or some other champion with a very powerful R into him. Pick Udyr or Corki or something and he's a piece of cake. The match starts at champ select, not when you spawn at your fountain. Sylas, more than most champions, takes macro- strategy to play against instead of TROLOLOL 1 MILLION DASHES OUTPLAYZ. I thought that most people around here wanted more of that in the game?","replies":[{"poster":"Cats Are Food","date":"2019-01-12T01:55:42.406+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is very true.\n\nThe only problem I see is that the champion pool is so dwindled that he will always have something useful to snag.","replies":[{"poster":"The Vilemaw Icon","date":"2019-01-12T04:02:15.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I'm not gonna pick a champ I don't play like Jayce in ranked in an attempt to gimp the Sylas, I'll just end up feeding.","replies":[{"poster":"Cats Are Food","date":"2019-01-12T07:42:32.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly.

Not every ult is useful to copy and thats part of what will make him not be broken. \nHe is supposed to be a counter pick, a champ that you pick if the enemy team fits your needs or has useful ults. So probably the right way to balance him is to imagine him being picked against a to him good but not perfect enemy team comp. Riot gives champs a budget. So if they give his ult an average value of 3/10 they give the rest of his kit 7/10. His kit should be bad without good ults but also not too good or opressive with some good ults. He should excel against teams with only strong ults.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mimr","date":"2019-01-11T18:20:24.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Real Lyze,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=eoLTKxh2,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2019-01-11T14:48:43.580+0000)\n>\n> You can not really make a reliable list in such a short time period.

The damage portion is an execute while the heal portion against champions is somewhat of a get out of jail free card.  This ability will feel like crap to play against.  \n\nIrelia's old E (the one where if she had a higher % max health than you, she'd slow you, and stun otherwise) was admitted by Riot to be horrible gameplay design which punished you if you were trading well against Ireli.  IMO, Kingslayer is very similar, and later in the game it promotes the \"counter play\" of having to burst Sylas down instantly or he will get a maximum of a 500 + 80% AP health heal when fighting you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GelsominoKiller","date":"2019-01-11T14:11:21.355+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't be so damn worried about him being the next unfixable kalista / Camille / Akali / irelia, if his base kit wasn't so **ridiculously overloaded**.\n\nStealing ults is probably the strongest ability in the game, and thus a lot of sylas power budget should be allocated there.\n\nCuriously enough, Sylas kit is seemingly designed to be self sufficient even without an ultimate.
