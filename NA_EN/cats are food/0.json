They hardly ever listen to the community, and if they do it's half-arsed.\n\nThey never do live Q&As or actively respond to their playerbase because they're too scared of the backlash and they know they'll get decimated, so they choose to hide behind their identities and slink back into the shadows of /r/LeagueOfLegends and Boards where they have the power to silence those who tell the truth; or let their hoard of fanboys defend them (most of which are new players and/or metaslaves who jerk off the Asian competitive scene, dawning it \"the best thing\" they've ever watched).\n\nThey ruin champions through reworks for the most part and then it takes them almost 2 years to respond to a champion they've left in the dust. \n\nThey directly copy other successful features from successful companies/corporations. E.g. A direct ripoff of Facebook's UI layout for the main client menu, loot boxes linked to progression, faster games to optimise experience for internet/LAN cafe users.\n\nExcept they don't have any of the features we've actually been asking for such as:\nA 3d model viewer for ALL skins, a proper optimised practice/sandbox tool, more than 1 permanent gamemode (ARAM and standard 5v5 may as well be the same thing) and user option editing for custom games (e.g. removing cooldowns, buffing/nerfing damage, buffing/nerfing champs, ability draft in that custom game). Oh, and a tool for users to create their own maps and champs and such specifically for custom games. \n\nHonestly that last point alone is enough reason to hate Riot. The only reason DOTA 2 isn't taking over by storm is because of its generally frustrating mechanics and somewhat slow gameplay. Other than that DOTA 2 is just better than League in every single way (outside of its recent balance history, which was taken from LoL's influence). Seriously, why does LoL still not have options for users to change to create their own custom gamemodes? Why is there only one mode?????\n\nOh yeah also, that woman in that article was found to be openly lying, so just this one time I can say that Riot Games definitely did not promote sexism in its general workplace stations. Just thought I'd comment on that. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"The summoner Icon has nothing to do with your ability to change the game, poor argument. \"\n\nNot true actually, the fact he's an honourable opponent means he's likely a half-decent player and he's sportsmanlike, which is THE stellar example of what every player should be like. \n\n\"Give me all the posts and exact placement of every Adapt or Leave argument made by a person who protects Riot.\"\n\nAny post/reply made by that \"PikaFox\" kid (the ADC guy) who says to quit the game cause \"you're bad\".

I am an asshole and I will never try to hide it because I am genuine and honest.\n\n> Because for the most part, everything written against Riot is, nerf, delete, nerf, delete, or champion is broken, with zero evidence or good reason.\n\nMost of the things that I read here are \"nerf this, because this and this\" they add some reasoning behind their thoughts. Feelings about something don't come from thin air. For example, when I say that Neeko has too much dmg, which is true, and you say that she has low win rate, I don't give a shit. She is unbalanced and has too much damage, because her design is based on \"she is only useful if she has dmg\" logic. Think about her kit. She cannot be nerfed so that she is balanced, if she gets nerfed she will be useless, if she gets buffed she will be broken. There is no middle ground for this champion. That is how bad design looks like and I will abuse her, until they rework her again. \n\nAlso none of her abilities are polished. Her ult doesn't even fit in her kit. Her w cannot change directions. Her q isn't even connected to her lore. Her e is ... lux q. Also not connected with her lore. She is a fucking cameleon, they could add some tongue attack or something. \n\nThere is no argument that is more meaningful that the other. There is good argument, the valid one and the bad argument, based on bad understanding of the topic. Before you look at something in a way \"Riot is, nerf, delete, nerf, delete, or champion is broken\" first read the reasoning behind that statement, because it might be valid. Even if there is some bullshit in there, if you counter his point and he seems to understand your thought, he might change his mind in a way. \n\nFor example now I know that I was wrong about tiamat. I thought that it will completely fuck Shaco. It didn't. I am still a god on him. Had to change my clear, yes, but it still didn't fuck me as hard as I thought it would. (me not playing the game too much is not only connected with League being shit, but also with PoE being ... too good)\n\n> The initial message I agree on, however, he must state it very clear that he is against rambling on both sides and he means that for a specific group and not all. He writes it as if everyone writes this as a comment on a post that attacks Riot.\n\nHe is a player, not a journalist. Being \"very clear\" and \"specific\" is hard. Even you are bad at it. Gosh. Even journalists are bad at it. Actually they are even worse than me. What we do on boards is often, venting our anger off. We are frustrated because that fucking malphite inted 12 times. Because Zoe oneshot us from the other side of the map. Because Rengar point and clicked us to death with a single combo. There is too much bullshit in the game at the moment. I remember times, when 3 champions were broken and you just banned them. Now 20 champions are broken and we have 10 bans, that can be the same sometimes. \n\nIf you are mad at players that complain, look at who created this situation. Riot has the worst PR in the whole gaming enviournment. Ok, Blizzard is worse. But still, Riot is disconnected with their playerbase, because they want to please Chineese players. They didn't try to reach to playerbase. Never did they try to talk with their playerbase. Do you see any response on boards from Riot? Do you see such responses anywhere else? \n\nRiot is responsible for this horrible situation, in which the playerbase is divided. A huge amount of players is unhappy (actually go into a game and ask people, gather info for a month and you will see that it is actually majority). Riot is a bad company. This is why I spend more time playing Path of Exile. Grinding Gear Games listens to playerbase, the game is progressing and seems so fun to play. Playerbase is happy. They all the time talk about PoE as a good game and PoE exists since 2013. You would expect people to get bored with the game and they don't. Each new season more people turn up and the game is getting bigger and bigger with each free expansion. Playerbase knows that GGG care about them and they appreciate it. \n\nI mean, the only people responsible for this mess are Riot employees. If they listened to playerbase from the start. From S1. Then we wouldn't be in this place to begin with. The game should be created for players, but at this moment the playerbase is divided and cannot be united anymore. In gaming industry a company has only one chance. They can never make a mistake. They need to be connected with playerbase.\n\nNow we see how big companies are falling and failing their players. None of them was trying to create a community. I would even say that Riot talk about League community, but I don't see any. We are all divided. Can't call that a community.  They should have listened to playerbase from S1 and work with the community, they disregarded them and now we are in this mess because of that.\n\nI love PoE. I loved League. There is just too much bullshit in the game for me to enjoy it. I will hit master and give up on League in this season. I am fully moving to PoE.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"y0r1ck","date":"2018-12-16T16:19:48.698+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":40,"body":"But it's the truth isn't it?

Your argument of \"They can post, but you shouldn't respond\"  is flawed.

I had really started playing it since Cataclysm. I stopped playing at Legion expansion because it was nothing like the WoW I first played it as years later. Made absolutely no difference how long I had been playing compared to the guy/girl next to me. Not sure why you think length of time played is relevant. It just makes you come off as entitled, which I know you don't mean to. Regardless, the league you remember is gone. The league I am playing is new to me.
