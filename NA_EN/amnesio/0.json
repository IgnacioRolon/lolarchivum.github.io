I use a Razor keyboard. It'll be fine for a few games, then suddenly I go to use an ability, the indicator will pop up, then I won't be able to use any abilities from my keyboard anymore. Quitting and rejoining has fixed the issue for me though. It's really intermittent. Even tried shutting down Razor Synapse mid game, but that didn't do anything either.","replies":[]}]}
