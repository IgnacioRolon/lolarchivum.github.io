Let's do some math.\n\nFor simplicity, let's say her 3rd deals 20% MAX HP. Let's also say her regular autos without the 3rd shot do no damage for this example.\n\n3 shots -> 80% HP remaining\n6 shots -> 60% HP remaining\n9 Shots -> 40% HP remaining\n12 shots -> 20% HP remaining\n15 shots -> Dead\n\nNew math - Simplicity's sake, her 3rd now deals 20% CURRENT HP. Assuming her regular autos deal no damage.\n\n3 shots -> 80% HP remaining\n6 shots -> 64% HP remaining\n9 shots -> 51.20% HP remaining\n12 shots -> 40.96% HP remaining\n15 shots -> 32.77% HP remaining.\n\nAs you can see from the math, if her Silver Bolts was shifted from %MAX to %CURRENT, she's good at shredding down tanks and other high HP threats, and tapers off the weaker they get. HOWEVER, this isn't even factoring in her auto attacks OR critical hits. There is not a single reason on this green earth why they couldn't make her do %CURRENT HP damage instead of max. She's going to be dealing huge chunks as it is, since it's true damage, and she's already building standard ADC crit builds and/or BORK for additional damage. The %MAX HP damage is just complete overkill, and unnecessary on her, since it just ends up severely harming squishier targets who cannot deal with her auto attacks and the constant %HP shred.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2019-03-25T08:38:33.310+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd say somewhere 1-3 on your scale, as in \"suggested change won't influence her winrates at all or very slightly\".
