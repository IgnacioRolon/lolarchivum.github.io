It's a metaphor. It means that Taric has become a metaphorical Shield for all life on Valoran. He is a lover and protector of all life.\n\nIf I may be so bold, would it be possible to change the title to something a little more... colorful? Exciting? \"The shield of x\" feels super generic (no offense intended!).\n\nI don't mean rework the whole thing but just use a better synonym - The Bastion of Valoran/Targon, Valoran Aegis, Bulwark of Valoran, even Ward or Rampart. Just a more exciting shield word. It feels like the equivalent of calling a new champ \"the Sword of Demacia\". Hell, use Braum as an example. If he had been the Shield of the Freljord, it would have really changed his feel compared to Heart of the Freljord. He and Taric share the same theme of protector here - Braum just gets one that adds to his feel (compassionate, warm), while Taric's is just kinda plain and descriptive.\n\nIn fact, just to spitball a little more, I think it'd be quick and fairly easy to rename a few of the champs we have that still have generic titles. How many have Blade in their names? Either Kat or Talon could use a little switchup - make Talon something like \"The Knife in the Dark\" etc. Aatrox has so much cool title potential, being a war deity who decides battles, but he's just \"the Darkin Blade\". Imagine, \"Aatrox, the Adjudicator/Saint of War/Tidechanger/Soldier's Boon/etc\". A title that conveys his role in changing the tides of war - the ones I gave as examples emphasize his role as a judge, or almost an angelic being (or demonic one, depending on which side he decides needs the help). Both trundle and trynd are \"the x king\", which is okay, except gangplank could have just as easily been the Pirate King but he gets a cool title instead. Hell, even calling Trynd a chief would feel a little better. Or call trundle the troll chief(tain), as a tongue-in-cheek reference to his desires of kinghood. Tahm too, but his feels better for some reason, almost as if \"River King\" is something tongue-in-cheek he'd call himself (\"Call me King... call me demon\"). Then you have the plain boring/generic ones, like Miss Fortune being just \"the Bounty Hunter\". These ones could just be all around more personal/indicative of the champ's personality and theme. There are quite a few of these \"Alistar the Minotaur\", etc. Titles like these are okay for champions who fit very niche archetypes, but for the basic themes it falls short. Imagine dropping the unique modifiers from some of the other titles in the game and you get the same result. Alistar the Minotaur is like Ryze the ~~Rogue~~ Mage or Ashe the ~~Frost~~ Archer.\n\nSorry to rant a bit - I just feel that titles are actually very important to making champs feel strong and meaningful in the grand scheme of Runeterra, and changing some of the more boring ones would be easy enough (and won't cause a huge amount of turmoil unless a \"bad\" name has some sentimental value to players, ie master of metal debacle, but none of the ones I'm suggesting have that kind of attachment I'm sure). We have some champs with such powerful/unique titles like the Star-Forger and the Boy Who Shattered Time. Not to say all new champs have hit the nail on  the head, Rek'sai's Void Burrower title is pretty lame compared to the possibilities you had with monster synonyms/sand predator/broodmother themes. It's just going from playing \"the Star Forger\" to \"the Shield of Valoran\" would be a little lame, no offense intended. Just my two cents on the topic while titles were being discussed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dunreadmyname","date":"2016-04-12T22:30:56.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for replying, I guess I'll just have to get used to the idea he's like a cleric now instead of a knight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2016-04-07T15:48:04.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Reav3,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=8AqO3Np1,comment-id=000b000b0000,timestamp=2016-04-07T14:18:33.817+0000)\n>\n> Sure!
