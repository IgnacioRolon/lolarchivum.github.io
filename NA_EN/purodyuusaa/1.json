I'd like to hear your takes on the other areas of the world though if you have a minute.  Clothing tells the story of a people after all.\n\nWe see that the people of the Freljord (and by extension the Woad skin line) all wear more rugged attire with furs and such.  The people of Shurima, what I can gather, all wear what you'd expect from desert folk, and those in Piltover all usually in steam-punk inspired clothes.\n\nCan you offer some insights on what's going on with places like Noxus?  Not just from a champion perspective but from what you think the everyday citizen wears in that place.  Does everyone dress like a murderous cutthroat you think?  What about Bandle City?  What does the everyday person in Zaun wear?  What does a normal person on Targon wear?  Are clothes like Annie's, backpack and all, common place elsewhere you think?\n\nI'm just curious and if you have the time, I'd love to hear your thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"IronStylus","date":"2015-02-13T09:12:48.040+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aaaacutally that's the purview of the artists from the Visual Development team.

They're probably grimy, and happy to be so.\n\nI've always seen Zaun as basically Shadowrun/X-Men, at a somewhat lower tech level and a higher magic level. Corporate-run urban civilization, with a culture that combines greed, fun-loving, and recklessness. Hence the drugs, pollution, and assorted hextech disasters, but also the cool consumer culture and wild innovation. I see Piltover as being more like \"let's make this train run 10% more efficiently than the previous version\", while Zaun is like \"let's find a way to teleport stuff across the city.\" Not that Zaun is \"better\" than Piltover; Piltover just has more of a traditional, gradualist approach, whereas Zaun is always pushing the edge, which doesn't always translate into overall better techâ€”just more exciting tech.\n\nI think it's also nice that Zaun has a rather decentralized government, without a King or High Command to speak for the entire state.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2015-02-14T12:14:47.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So far only Jinx and maybe Janna have a Zaun theme of revealing/punk clothing.\n\nYou guys spend a lot of time developing Noxus.

I mean, this is *exactly* the sort of thing that the creative teams should be gathering ideas about at *precisely* the right time to start collecting them... yet, it's all being done in seclusion, far away from the fans who care the most about it.\n\nI mean, if you guys don't want fan input or interaction on this stuff, someone should at least say it so we can move on.

What has Narrative, no matter who was in charge of the department, done with their fan community that even remotely suggests that they can be trusted?\n2. I did this exact thing recently, gathering topics from fans to discuss with Narrative.  The end result?  Nothing from Narrative or anyone involved in creative.  They asked for suggestions, we provided them, and they took a huge dump on our collective work.\n2. Ant in Oz mentioned that they don't read story ideas for (undisclosed) legal reasons.\n\nSo, no.
