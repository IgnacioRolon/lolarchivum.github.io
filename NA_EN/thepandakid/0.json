She died for first blood which I was ok with, but almost immediately my lane started getting pushed back. And of course, under turret sometimes the enemy would poke me. I&#039;m ok with all of this stuff, but I just want to know what are some effective ways of winning back lane? I&#039;ve herd freezing helps but not always. If you let me know that would be a great help.\r\nThanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"Skia Asteri","date":"2015-04-14T18:26:15.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hit level 2 first, especially in bot lane.

She can get shat on all laning phase, but once that hydra and black cleaver or last whisper is done, tell your ADC to hide in fights, cause she's gonna hurt.\n\nOr reaching 40% CDR on Nasus. Doesn't matter how quick it happens, but when it happens, it's literally starting a death-timer for their objectives. They can either sit on you for 35 minutes and make sure you stay down or they can try to play normally and let the 400 stack cane smack away at their tower every time they try to do anything not in top lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-04-12T22:05:52.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as winning back lanes that comes from one of two things. Either 1) Noticing an enemy misstep and punishing it (assuming you are not so far behind that trading is impossible) or 2) Using a power spike. Now using a power spike does not mean that because the enemy is ahead you can't fight, you have to deny backs, delay them to let you catch up and be at a more equal power level. You also have to learn based on the lane positioning which CS you can deny and trade damage for. \n\nWhen behind making the enemy trade HP for gold. As you trade more HP for small amounts of gold you gain lane pressure, reducing the pressure of the item disadvantage because while they may have more power you have more HP, especially in soloQ this will lead to more likelihood of one of the players (in a 2v2/3v3 situation) second guessing the fight, giving you a slight advantage, as well as you may do it enough to where they don't even trade, just take free damage.","replies":[{"poster":"ThePandaKid","date":"2015-04-13T00:37:49.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your time to type this out, this really helped me out :)","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-04-13T01:37:44.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No problem, if you have specific questions feel free to add in game and ask","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Leti the Yeti","date":"2015-04-12T22:51:36.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"how bout you don't lose\nlearn how to NOT lose by playing like a million nasus games\nturns you into an expert","replies":[]},{"poster":"Renaille","date":"2015-04-12T21:36:34.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Stacking dorans and picking early game champs are the most reliable ways.
