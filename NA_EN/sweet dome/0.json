Before you scream at me for being a complaining loser and saying that I need to get better, hear me out. I was Silver V last season, which was just my provisionals. I decided with the new Season and all that I wanted to finally get into Ranked and try to ascend into Goldhood. I won 6 of my provisionals, in which i did well with Volibear in about 8 of them, but my internet and bad decision making ruined my chances of helping the team out in some instances. I ended up Bronze II.\r\n\r\nBasically, what brought this about was a ranked game I played today in which i was 3rd pick, with our jungle and support being 1st and 2nd pick respectively. Jax and Teemo. I played Wukong top because I thought it was a relatively safe pick. But when we got down to 4th pick, who apparently wasn't very fond of Teemo support, he said, and I quote, \"if our support is going to troll I might as well too\". So played they Hecarim mid. Against a Yasuo. We actually got first and second blood due to cooperation with Jax and me at Mid and Top, but after that the Hec fed Yasuo to all hell. Bot also was having a rough time against Draven, but with their double blind comp with Quinn, i thought they might be able to pull through.\r\n\r\nThey did not. So it ended up being around 13 to 45 before they eventually beat us. I ended up feeding because Yas and Draven were too strong and often jumped on me top when i was trying to keep the waves under control. Ended up 2 and 7. \r\n\r\nThe entire point about this post is that this sort of thing is a common occurrence in Bronze Elo. People constantly troll because literally anyone can play at that level and they think that it's funny to ruin other people's actually attempts at getting better and ranking up. In doing this, they are forcing people who are actually trying, and doing reasonably good, into descending farther down their divisions and possibly getting demoted. League of Legends is a team game. It's an obvious notion that is taken advantage of when people are playing in Bronze. \r\n\r\nOne person has the potential of ruining any number of games for a whole lot of people. People who are actually trying to have fun rising in divisions are the ones getting hit because of it. The least that Riot could do is factor your participation in objectives, kills, and assists towards how much LP you lose instead of how it is now, where if you lose you lose almost a win's worth of LP.\r\n\r\nI'm not amazing. I can't carry most of the time. I'm probably high Silver skill range on an incredibly good day. All I want to do is compete in a game where people try to get better and get promoted. I know it wouldn't make sense to have your rank be dependent on your skill alone. However, I'm just wondering if the system would improve if people who did well in games and gave their all trying to salvage lost games and push to a win, could be rewarded for such behavior by not making the loss they receive so crippling due to people who troll and frankly make the game frustrating to attempt to play.\r\n\r\nMMR and objective assists should affect how much LP you lose during a loss as a way to both reward teamwork and participation and limit the impact of trolls and people who intentionally try to lose the game as a way of making lower Elo more accessible and allowing those who are actually putting in time and effort into getting better and their gameplay to have a better chance of succeeding in their endevours and reaching the skill level where they belong.\r\n\r\ntl;dr: Trolls ruin early Elo games for people who are actually trying to accomplish reaching their \"goal rank\". Riot should find some way to implement a person's performance in the form of kills, assists, and objective capturing into how much LP they lose for being defeated in a Ranked game, where more kills/assists/objectives would cause you to lose less LP as a result. Doing this would allow people to get through the early tiers if they possess the skill to reach the next level, and make trolling less impactful.\r\n\r\nSorry that even my tl;dr is super long.\r\n\r\nPlease discuss and help make Riot Senpai notice me. \r\n\r\n-Summoner Name: Litwin","replies":[{"poster":"Raptamei","date":"2015-02-03T07:27:51.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I went 2-7 because my team was bad.

They seem to ignore all the games they won because the same problems existed on the opposing team. These things balance out. You get impossible games and you get wins handed to you without having to try.  In the long run your own skill determines how you fare.\n\nSecondly the idea about different LP gain. You simply cant implement such a system. Instead of trying to win players would spend their time trying to optimize for the best score. People would refuse playing roles and strategies that provide less points for whatever reason.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MPendragon","date":"2015-02-02T05:54:51.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No offense, at that particular ELO, they are not trolling. They're just extremely unskilled, which is why they are in that ELO.\n\nUnskilled goes as high as Plat 1 / Diamond 5, i'm next to positive about that.\n\nThe algorithm is terrible, but it is literally POSSIBLE, for a player to get to a division they honestly do not belong in. However improbable this may be, it is not impossible.\n\nI lantern Warwick to bot lane to get a successful gank off on their bot laners, I get a hook off on Ezreal as Thresh, and Warwick ultimates Sona...\n\nI don't get it, do people not see the difference in priority, at all?\n\nSome people are just clueless, and they're in a different ball game, altogether.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2015-02-02T05:38:14.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">MMR and objective assists should affect how much LP you lose during a loss as a way to both reward teamwork and participation and limit the impact of trolls and people who intentionally try to lose the game as a way of making lower Elo more accessible and allowing those who are actually putting in time and effort into getting better and their gameplay to have a better chance of succeeding in their endevours and reaching the skill level where they belong.\n\n\nThats not going to happen anytime soon. Best you can do is pick snowball champions that can carry games by themselves and pray that you dont get a troll or an afk. Thats the best advice I can give you from someone who went from Bronze 4 to Gold 3.","replies":[]}]}
