When i land a sleepy bubble on someone in fog of war, the effect of the sleep is very hard for me to see (due to colourblindness). The effect if the sleep is too dark to see compared to the bright effect of the pool party skin. I have colourblind mode on, but its still very difficult to make out where a sleepy enemy is in fog of war with this skin. It doesnt have much visual clarity unlike the others. I am suggesting that the effect is either made brighter or a new more concentrated effect replaces it. im sure i cant be the only one struggling with this.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2019-09-13T00:36:13.614+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's difficult to see even with perfect vision.  It was pointed out on the pbe boards several times but nothing was done about it.\n\nI was really excited for the skin, but until they fix that I don't think I'll get the skin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Avatar KyÎ¿shi","date":"2019-09-13T04:48:34.756+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/9R6UEOLz-zoe-star-guardian-e-indicator-on-the-fog-of-war-is-bugged-every-single-time-a-champion-falls-asleep I did a more detailed post about it as well","replies":[]}]}
