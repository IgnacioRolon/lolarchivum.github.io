It sounds to me like the system thinks you really shouldn't be in bronze so it keeps giving you matchups that you think are harder, when in actuality it's more evenly matched that way. Keep winning those matches and you should either shoot up in rank soon, or the matchmaking system will level out and start giving you fairer matchups.","replies":[{"poster":"golem kid","date":"2017-11-04T21:25:02.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"then shouldn't i be silver?\n","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-06T03:21:13.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your hidden MMR could, in fact, be more lined up with SIlver players, but you'll still need to actively play and win games to climb up the ladder by getting to 100 LP and winning the promos.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rengar Only","date":"2017-10-29T15:23:16.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After examining the problem, I came to the conclusion that the people you play with actually rank in LOW silver. But if you look closer to their winrates and MMR, you can see that their MMR is lower than silver. Therefore they are matched with you.
