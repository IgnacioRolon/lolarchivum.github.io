Moreover, if the reason behind meta shifting will be further damage buffs to compete with buffed survivability, the problem of MF dealing idiotic amount of damage will only be exacerbated.\r\n\r\nIn the end, a short and harsh message to the riot balance team: you're blind.

The problem is not tanks being too weak to tank anything, the problem is that there is so much damage, armor penetration, and true damage on AD items that tanks can't do their job. If you think tanks are weak, then why is it that they do part of their job well by tanking so much magic damage but yet they can't do jack crap against AD damage like everyone else? \n\nFor me, what I would like to see changed to improve the game for many players is to remove Duskblade, Stormrazor, Conqueror, and IE's true damage. Other changes I would like to see are changing the last whisper items back into bonus armor pen instead of total, lowering the damage some of the rune trees give, and nerfing the best runes that are also responsible for the massive damage in the game such as: Celerity, Transcendence, Scorch, Gathering Storm, Coup De Grace, Last Stand, Alacrity, Sudden Impact, Cheap Shot, Eyeball Collection, Summon Aery, Arcane Comet, Dark Harvest, Predator and of course the infamous Electrocute.","replies":[{"poster":"Void Kaiju","date":"2018-08-05T20:15:51.968+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"IE's true damage is probably healthier than what it used to have. It just came in at a time where there were already some overtuned sources of true damage in the game so it was an unwelcome change. \nWhen tanks were strong before, your ADC could not do ANYTHING to them if they were ahead other than die horribly. (See Malphite every time he wins lane), IE gives them at least a baseline and pulls back on their damage vs squishies with the true damage conversion. I think pulling some of the AD off of crit adc items and making them cheaper has probably done better to balance out their damage than reverting IE would. \nAnd I love playing tanks. If you cut all the true damage they will instantly become crushingly powerful in toplane and jungle again. Vayne and Kogmaw and Kaisa would dominate the botlane meta as the only champs who could touch them. Champ diversity would drop very quickly and very far. \n\nNerfing all the damage sources at the same time would be as harsh a change to the meta as the ADC gutting was. It would be too heavy handed. Right now they are looking at nerfs for a number of he high damage keystones, and i believe the AD on stormrazor was reduced? And they're looking at making duskblade and stormrazor share a unique passive so that they no longer stack. Things are being done. Is it later than they should have been done? Almost certainly. But according to Riot they are on the way. \n\nI do think Tanks need some love but honestly rather than removing true damage, it should be in nerfing Conqueror's true damage (the main culprit that often fucks me as a tank.), and giving them more access to base resists/ability to survive lane in the earlygame that doesn't scale into maddening levels lategame. And maybe reducing their kit damage and moving some of that damage into their items. \n\nTLDR don't remove all sources of true damage because it will help keep tanks in line after they inevitably become meta following incoming nerfs to damage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Incredibly Lucid","date":"2018-08-05T22:26:01.947+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's possible a new tank will come out soon as a champ, and the skin cycles for tanks will be released too, it's all apart of the business my dude.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rayzo","date":"2018-08-06T19:46:54.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'd much rather have a tank meta than this stupid oneshot meta","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"z63XnLCMwX","date":"2018-08-05T01:07:01.830+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":3,"body":"Can we nerf mobility as well?

For a design to be healthy or unhealthy is not an alien concept. Examples of changes on behalf of \"unhealthy\" designs include the failed assassin update and the Urgot update. The term is generally used to refer to things that have serious design flaws that impact the fun and feel of the game negatively, or that have too much impact on the outcome of the game. \n\n\"Change for the sake of change\" is a community-developed term to describe changes Riot makes just to \"spice things up\". Some champion updates fall into \"change for the sake of change\", such as the Singed update. Singed didn't have problems. He had a solid playerbase, and a solid balance philosophy, being a very niche champion with a dedicated circle of mains that was hard to master. His changes were unnessecary because his prior design didn't really warrant them. Thus, his case is \"change for the sake of change\". Aurelion Sol almost underwent a change for the sake of change update, after recieving an update to remedy unhealthy design. It didn't happen. Many preseason jungle changes are examples of change for the sake of change.\n\nThese are not difficult concepts to grasp. If you're attempting to de-legitimize them, maybe you don't understand them, or otherwise have no way to force your opinion on others besides delegitimizing their concerns.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarukongSr","date":"2018-08-06T03:28:54.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you could nerf mobility by introducing more grounding effects that only affect basic abilities rather than flash or ultimates.

I think part of what got us here is that tanks were too durable originally, and from then on we experienced massive increases in damage, alongside power shifts that gave tanks more offense at a cost to their itemized defenses. Making tanks tankier, without lowering their own damage, will only worsen the issues at hand, and make champions without innate anti-tank damage even worse against the class without some sort of hard-counter item. We need damage reductions across the board first, and only afterwards should we see whether tanks need buffs.\n\nWhat also concerns me is that I think those tank changes are not being implemented in the best way. In my opinion, tank defenses right now are too passive, which is why it's often all too easy to counter them via equally passive effects, and why tanks themselves lack agency when it comes to mitigating specific effects. If tanks are to receive class, wide changes, I think it should involve them having more active defenses, i.e. more powerful actives that allow for clutch-protection and mitigation, rather than large innate health pools or long-lasting damage resistance. In this respect, buffing tanks via stat changes or scaling increases to their long-lasting protections I don't think will help entirely.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Space Cowboy","date":"2018-08-06T21:51:39.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How bout nerf damage and buff tank and buff towers","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dweeebles","date":"2018-08-06T18:18:28.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that tank meta a few years ago was 1000% worse that the current meta.

If my choices are high damage games going only 15 to maybe 20 mins vs tank meta where team fights last longer, and lane phases last longer then I will choose the tank meta. Tanks right now last maybe 3 secs in team fights because of how much damage can be dished out. \n\nI remember the old days where lane phases lasted at least 20 mins before the real fights, and pushes started. Games lasted 45 to 55 mins, and the thing I miss the most so much is a single player could carry themselves. Didn't matter if you had feeders or troll on your team. back then if a player played smart he or she could carry and end the match. \n\nThe game right now is so heavy team based that one person can risk the game. Back then it wasn't like that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FoxV","date":"2018-08-06T09:30:05.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When the Tank Meta comes i have to pray i can deal any damage before they run into me at mach 5 because screw adc just build bork and armor pen everything will be ok.(I deal no damage with my aa against tank even though i bought full crit armor pen and a bork)","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpongebobIsLife","date":"2018-08-06T02:03:33.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, tanks are just gonna dominate if they both buff tanks and nerf damage all in the same patch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sohleks","date":"2018-08-06T01:48:03.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right on my man.\n\nI had to log in to give this upvote 100","replies":[]}]}
