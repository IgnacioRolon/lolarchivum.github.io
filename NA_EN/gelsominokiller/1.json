He doesn't get to choose \"now I get my perma slows!\" Or most of his other stuff unlike any other champion who can have whatever they have whenever they want as long as CD complies. \"He has a lot for one champion!\" Cool so does many other champions. Stating what any champion does or has is a pretty pointless and irrelevant point since you can literally do that to every single champion in the game and they'll sound completely busted and broken. Without any context on what the champion has available then saying \"look at everything this dude has!\" Doesn't really matter.","replies":[{"poster":"Acemaster81","date":"2019-11-30T06:38:10.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except that this list is noticeably longer than many other champions. \n\n{{champion:22}} permaslow and stun on global ulti.\n{{champion:96}} Long range, slow, and %hp damage.\n{{champion:15}} MS boosts, spellshield, and waveclear.\n{{champion:236}} MS boosts, dash, decent range ulti.\n{{champion:51}} Really long range, poke, slow/dash, and a root.\n{{champion:42}} Magic damage instead of all AD, Dash/Area denial, and MS boost.\n{{champion:81}} Long range and escape.\n{{champion:119}} High damage, displacement, long range ult.\n{{champion:21}} Decent damage, MS boost, ranged slow and high damage ult.\n{{champion:498}} Root and untargetability on ultimate.\n\nI might have forgotten something here, but my point is that a majority of carries don't have everything their class needs.\n\nAdc's usually don't have healing built in their kits unless with certain runes, summoner spells, or items as lifesteal and lethality are typically what an adc might want to buy for an item. They also usually don't have shields or hard cc that is easy or reliable to land. Please tell me what other champions have a lot of what their class desires.

This lesson is apparently disregarded with the new design team, that puts it on Aphelios without much thought. That's my point.\n\nAshe was made unviable for a lot of time because of her permaslow, and she was allowed to be strong only with her rework, that revolved around implementing a permaslow mechanic without breaking the power budget and creating weakness for Ashe that her opponents could exploit.

I'm not sure how that particular aspect of Aphelios will turn out (although the champ as a whole definitely doesn't belong in the game).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"XJ99999999999999","date":"2019-11-30T01:28:10.845+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"skarners perma slow was fun af.","replies":[]},{"poster":"boricCentaur1","date":"2019-11-30T01:47:22.539+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"GelsominoKiller","date":"2019-11-30T12:21:22.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm going to pretend that you didn't lash out pointless personal attacks.
