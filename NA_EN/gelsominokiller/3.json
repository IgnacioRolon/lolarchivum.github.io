If you look up my profile on any site, you&#039;ll see that last month or so, I&#039;ve played mostly ARAM games, one per day... and this comes from somebody that in all those years of following League, couldn&#039;t give two shits about ARAM. I realized that this is a symptom of my lack of interest and motivation to queue up for a summoner&#039;s rift game. And I believe that this behavior is a common descending parabola for many players about to abandon the game. I also believe that Riot&#039;s is well aware of said parabola.\r\n\r\n**First off, I want to differentiate myself from a consistent number of venting threads that we can find on those boards by saying that I LOVE League of Legends. I want to keep playing this game. I want to buy skins to support Riot whenever I feel right. I really, really don&#039;t want to stop playing the game. That&#039;s why I&#039;m writing this post, out of love for League of Legends.** And while this is meant to be a negative feedback thread, I can&#039;t stop myself from briefly praising Riot for the amazing work they have put up recently regarding the out-of-game systems and client. Many awesome features have been introduced in this last years (loot systems, replays, universe page, etc.). The quality of skins and champions has gone through the roof. I&#039;d spend more time complimenting, but I must go straight to the point.\r\n\r\nI&#039;d push myself to say that everything outside of the game has made giant steps forward. The problem i have is, however, with the game itself. I consider myself a somewhat mature user of the game: I understand metagames rotate and why Riot had a legitimate interest in keeping them rotating. I like to play certain classes, namely fighters, tanks and some assassins. I like being in the middle of the fray. As a player, I can endure an unfavorable meta for some time, and find a compromise between adapting my champion pool and be faithful to those champions i genuinely enjoy playing. I also understand that some champions will be OP for a while, and some champions UP. I have no problem with that. That said...\r\n\r\n**I feel deprived of agency on the course of the game. I feel a slave to my carries. I don&#039;t feel self-sufficient as a tank, as a bruiser, as an assassin. **\r\n\r\nWhen I dive in as a bruiser, I don&#039;t feel like a threat to the backline, but more of a punching bag buying some time for my team to do something. They don&#039;t run from me anymore.\r\n\r\nWhen I dive in as an assassin (after a certain game time), i often see the ADC&#039;s health doubling out of shields, and very often i have to face a more reliable burst coming out of the ADC than what I can pull through as an assassin.\r\n\r\nWhen I play a tank I don&#039;t actually soak damage.. and this is heartbreaking. It&#039;s _years_ I don&#039;t feel immortal behind enemy lines because I&#039;m fed. I immobilize a carry and wait my team to kill him. If they fail, I melt and the fight is lost. Just look at this world clip i believe it&#039;s explanatory:\r\n\r\n[https://youtu.be/yLJoPe0YCJg?t=32m45s](https://youtu.be/yLJoPe0YCJg?t=32m45s)\r\n\r\nThrow everything you have to the enemy carry. If shields make him survive, you lost the fight and might as well retreat. If you succeed into taking him down, you have won the fight. This mindless clash is what league of legends is since 8 months. If you don&#039;t believe me, look up competitive games and pay attention on how the teamfight unfolds.\r\n\r\nSeason 7 has been traumatic for me. **I played through this preseason and I realized that the problem isn&#039;t in a particularly unfortunate streak of unfavorable metagames, but what Riot&#039;s vision of the game has become.** Don&#039;t get me wrong, even if I&#039;m not a fan of it, I don&#039;t mind Riot&#039;s stance of pushing for shorter games. If that&#039;s the direction they think is more profitable for their game, that&#039;s a fair objective i sincerely wish they can pull through. What I despise is, however, how this has been achieved, that is by having extremely heavy snowballing. Compressed game time and importance of snowballing exacerbate the issue I&#039;m about to point out.\r\n\r\nEven if they are by far the worst offenders right now, I don&#039;t want to focus on ADCs, but talk about **that tainted game design that is forcing me out of this game: the CARRY MENTALITY. In my opinion, Riot envisions the game as a hunt for the carry, an endless battle of those damage dealers forced to &quot;DEFEND&quot; themselves from the big bad evil bruisers, assassins and tanks coming at them.** Riot puts every effort into packing carry kits with kiting, CC, mobility; similarly supports are packed with extremely impactful itemization and spells to knock off those pesky players. Dying to assassins is unfun, so they&#039;re reworked to be gated and delayed. Dying to assassin is unfun, so have Locket, a 500 hp point and click instant shield. The carry survives, he&#039;s happy. The support made the carry survive, he&#039;s happy. The assassin endures a year of this shit and eventually becomes fed up with the game.\r\n\r\nI wish I could go more in detail to point out all the faults in how those class interactions and designs are handled, but I must keep the topic relatively &quot;short&quot;.\r\n\r\nThere is zero interest by Riot&#039;s side into making bruisers, tanks or assassins a successful class in the game; all Riot&#039;s interest is focused on keeping them in check so they don&#039;t disrupt too much the carry classes. A single knockback by Azir ult is often enough to render a juggernaut dead meat, yet Azir has mobility and CC to spare, on top of extreme DPS. For them a single slow can be a hard CC, and yet there is no itemization to help them out. Oddly enough, their itemization is the most expensive in the game, while ADCs, which scale multiplicatively into demigods, abuse the cheapest. This is evident not only in systematic choices like itemization, but also in everyday balance handling: Riot absolutely wrecks and forgets about my boy Nautilus, and leaves twitch unchecked for a year. Bruisers overperforming are promptly nerfed, overtuned carries are handled with extreme caution god forbid they lose too much power. ADCs have an entire RUNE TREE designed SPECIFICALLY for their needs, and yet Riot &quot;&quot;&quot;FORGETS&quot;&quot;&quot; to give 40 bruisers a decent keystone? And when confronted with the issue, what do they do? Try to shove bruisers with tanks, with detriment to both sides (thank god that awful grasp change didn&#039;t make it through).\r\n\r\nAs a result, many players like me feel alienated. I feel like i queue up for a coinflip.. do i have the winning carry? Who gets FB and FTB? My player agency is to make my carry fed, or protect my carry, or buy time for my carry, or immobilize the enemy carry for my carries to kill him. I don&#039;t matter in League of Legends. Riot doesn&#039;t care about my enjoyment when I play the classes I like to play. I had this feeling since I got back with the game last year, and now I don&#039;t think I wish to endure it any longer. The classes I enjoy playing have been neglected for too long, and now i have realized that this is a deliberate design choice, so i have no reason to stay hoping for a more fitting meta.\r\n\r\n**I don&#039;t want to leave the post with the idea that I&#039;m angry and done forever with League. I will gladly come back. Probably I will play games once in a while, and if I will find myself having fun, I will be happy to get back on track. That said, i&#039;t&#039;s undeniable right now i genuinely don&#039;t enjoy the game and (very sadly) won&#039;t play very often unless something changes.**\r\n\r\n_TL;DR: I wish Riot had a more fair approach when balancing and designing champions, runes, itemization and class interactions, paying the same attention to the game fantasy, fun and success cases of ALL classes. I don&#039;t enjoy League of Legends right now because I don&#039;t feel like a protagonist of the match, but more of an enabler of someone else._","replies":[{"poster":"Fisher No Chains","date":"2018-01-24T22:02:19.493+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":1,"body":"As a LB main and midlane main, I can't agree more, especially on the assassins' thoughts.\n\nWith the assassins' reworks, Riot said that they wanted to lower that feast or famine feeling when playing them when in reality, with all those changes they've made during S7/S8, they've just made it worse.\n\nBefore season 7, at least mid season, I felt like I could actually carry games playing AP carries or assassins and snowballing even if sidelanes weren't that good. Now everything I play has to be a supportive thing for our botlane. If I play LB, I better roam (especially if my bot is bad) and give my botlane a lead or I lose around minute 25. After that time, I'm a chain bot that can't go through 1k damage shields unless I'm full build and I poke consistently with WQ. \n\nIf I play a mage, I'm just a CC machine that needs to stun the enemy team so my ADC can melt them. I don't even try to full-combo burst glass cannon carries because they don't exist and whole ultimates get eaten by shields or bullshit like that. For example, most of the time Syndra isn't able to 100-0 a carry in a fight and it's just better to ult someone and get a free AoE stun.\n\n\nAnd I totally agree with everything else. If Riot wants shorter games, good, it's their game and they can do whatever they want with it. But they have chosen the wrong path to achieve their goals, and I think they'll realise it sooner or later.","replies":[{"poster":"GelsominoKiller","date":"2018-01-24T22:57:22.613+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"If i can leave a strawman argument concerning the state of assassins, we're in a meta where Kha is strong and doesn't evolve his leap. \n\nThis says a lot.","replies":[{"poster":"Fisher No Chains","date":"2018-01-24T23:16:25.223+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assassins are in a weird spot right now.

Back in season 4 and 5 where picking enchanters as supports was considered trolling (outside Janna of course), you still had a chance to win and outplay things. Even with the bullshit of season 6 where a lot of stuff got drastic changes, you could still pull off some borderline off-meta strats by stealing dragon as a duo while your jungler and enemy team was busy with toplane. You could even force camps botlane and your toplaner would actually be useful because he has the powers to get first tower for more advantage. What about that one item that everyone said was \"useless\" on a said champ, but you rushed that every game and won because of that anyways?\n\nDo that from season 7 and on, anything slightly off-meta is considered trolling and you were basically asking to lose **even in low elo**. Not picking a meta champion is \"trolling\", because the disadvantages are way too huge. For example, during lethality meta, if you were an ADC that isn't Varus or Jhin, you were asking to lose because you will just be deleted before you can even do anything, and no support can save you from it. Even if you managed to pick them, you still had to follow the strict recipe of meta by building lethality, or else you're going to be almost completely useless. During Ardent Censer meta, picking a said enchanter isn't enough. You have to make sure to rush the same item every game the very first thing or else you were trolling. Even the playstyle has to be strictly meta, if that wasn't enough.\n\nI know I'm just a no-name in gold, I probably just suck shit at the game and that my examples and opinions are so anecdotal that they're probably insignificant, but the main issue still lies: **you either play the meta or troll, with nothing in-between.** Back to your example, playing bruisers and assassins as carries have been \"offmeta\", and I've seen people lost because they were trying to do that. To put it short: with how balance works nowadays, there is very little room for \"playstyle diversity\", especially in low elo. A lot of us know that \"anything\" works in low elo, but it's not necessarily true anymore, and that's telling us a lot on how much more of a \"metagame\" League has become.\n\nYou know what, I just want to be able to make my own playstyles and builds, and find a way to make it work in gold again. I just want to be able to outsmart people with well-timed plays, instead of building whatever's strictly meta and statcheck enemies to victory. I want to see carries from more than one lane at a time so that everyone, not just the carry, is a threat.","replies":[{"poster":"Carniverous","date":"2018-01-25T10:48:36.755+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel ya on these strict expectations by players.

I typically cast r first and then cast w Q aa for a few reasons. Firstly it recalls r blades faster. If your close enough your aa reset will proc the bleed. (This is rare and it allows the support to react because they see you ult) But typically I don't find mid/late game talon needing the bleed to kill them unless they dodge the recall of rake. Which they are forced to flash typically as you can position yourself in such a way they the recall will hit them.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Velasan","date":"2018-01-25T21:47:05.494+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't say I'm losing interest in the game... but one thing I definitely agree with is too much focus on the bot lane.\n\nI just played a game yesterday.

The obvious points are obvious but bear mention for clarity.  Teamfights are between teams: each champion must do what their team needs them to do.  Some champion classes are not designed for teamfighting but rather entirely different purposes.\n\nThe classes of melee champions that build damage are in this category.  Juggernauts, divers, skirmishers, and assassins are all designed to snowball their strong laning into early objectives and such a lead that more than one enemy champion must answer their splitpush, granting their own team a numbers advantage on the other side of the map.  While all these champions can teamfight, tanks just do it better.\n\nThe ability to reliably dive the backline without a large lead or team follow-up is unhealthy.  Not even Vanguards, tanks designed to close with the enemy and get past their frontline, should be able to do it.  It leaves tanks and supports helpless to defend their carries, who can only run and hope not to be caught.  The only person having fun is the one diving.\n\nAs for the “carry mentality,” that’s part and parcel to the game.  If a team picks two tanks and an enchanter, then it can create a safe enough backline to pick two fragile but powerful carries.  If that team has not fallen too far behind after laning against, say, a juggernaut top and an assassin mid while an enemy diver roamed the jungle, then its players have proven better and deserve a superior teamfight to close the game.  \n\nWhile non-tank top-laners do need a rune designed for them in order to be the stronger lane pick, and although assassins would enjoy less-frustrating counter-mechanics, your idea of how the category of champions you described should work would make everyone except their players miserable.  Let’s not do that.","replies":[{"poster":"GelsominoKiller","date":"2018-01-25T13:47:09.361+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am sorry to be rude, but your critics are  based on assumptions that are simply wrong and fake.\n\n> The classes of melee champions that build damage are in this category.

I said that they are meant to be better in lane and while splitpushing, but that tanks are meant to  be better teamfighters.  Read my post again if you don’t believe me, and do not put words in my mouth.\n\nI was not around in Season 4 and have no idea how professional teams countered a protect-the-kog’maw comp.  If I may guess, then they tried to make the midlane assassin snowball, used the diver to disrupt, and tried to win the game before the enemy team scaled.  Otherwise I can’t really discuss this.\n\nThe reason assassins have to fall-off during the late game is that they would otherwise be overpowered.  Rather than scaling, they snowball, becoming able to almost solo-carry the game.  If they hit six items and stayed as strong as, say, a mage into the late game, then they could lose only by throwing once even slightly ahead.  Again, the only person having fun would be the assassin.\n\nMelee damage dealers are finally healthy now.  They need to use their strong laning phase to get ahead and then roam to snowball themselves and their team before the enemy can scale and group.  Skirmishers, divers, and juggernauts need to win their lane and then splitpush to take objectives or create numbers advantages.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Besteal","date":"2018-01-25T12:44:28.964+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh, the previous adc meta was far less cancerous than the current one.

In these sports, if you are competing, even at a very low level, such as a high school weekly game (bronze), you still train during the week with your team, and play your position. \n\nThere will be players on your team that are a better shot, or can do a nice lay up, and so you creat opportunities for them to score and win the game. In that sense, they are the adc, and you are the top lane tank.\n\nI would wager that league would be much more fun if you put together a small band of friends and play as a team, working on your strategies, communicating and helping each other out, everyone doing their bit to make the finish line, rather than being in this mind set of ‘how can I carry? How can I influence the game?’ Which is common and often necessary in soloQ.\n\nSo that what I think. Not everyone can be the protagonist in every game. Sometimes you have to be the enabler, and share the glory of victory that you helped to earn.

Hell, that's how some teams win-their offense sucks, but their defense is so hard core it doesn't matter.\n\nIn League terms, it'd be like if after halftime, forwards were given points for getting the ball across the field-not even in the goal. No one else is allowed to do it-but you can \"assist\" by passing to one. This is maybe a bit over the top, but it's how it feels in League.\n\nSecond, as far as games not going long...this is the issue. Even with shorter games, ADC's are *still* getting strong fast enough to become a huge threat. Their itemization is inexpensive and thus they hit that point faster, so even with quick games they still end up ruling the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Longtowel","date":"2018-01-26T07:21:53.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, I feel you.\n\nI suppose you could try to assess your importance in the team with different criteria, since it’s easily to feel powerful as the ADC as you are killing everyone.\n\nBut say for example, you are the support and you managed to peel off 2 assassins and kept your adc alive long enough, or if you are the tank and you had a perfect five man initiate - that’s equally as important!\n\nMaybe think of ADCs not as another player perhaps but a missile launching pad. It takes time to build, the enemy wants to bomb it, and you need to keep it safe so that it can do it’s job and explode your enemies.\n\nThat’s just me.

Ground troops cannot get through on their own. Only the missile can carry out the mission.\n\nThis actually feels like a realistic assessment of how League plays out most of the time. It only gets worse when we look at a fed player. Sure, a fed Assassin can be scary-he'll pop your ADC before you can blink-but he doesn't get DPS, so he'll fall off. A fed tank is impossible to 1 vs 1-but then his team isn't doing a whole lot of damage, and you could potentially focus him down if he pulls a bad initiate.\n\nA fed ADC?

Much how assassins and some mages are meant to kill squishies, juggernauts are meant to waddle in the thick of it and deal lots of damage-while taking quite a bit-at the cost of mobility/utility, and tanks are meant to protect/initiate/be a protective wall, ADC's should be a damage threat-but not the sole purpose of the team.\n\nThink of it this way. What roles can you think of that have been played since the games iteration in greater than 99% of games?\n\nThe only answer is ADC's, and this is an issue. No other role gets the privilege of being REQUIRED. Yeah, it's' nice to have a tank or two, and in some metas they thrive-but they aren't always around. There have been times where they were 100% useless and picked rarely, if at all. The same can be said for any other class except ADC's. We had a brief stint a year ago where they were \"trash\"-except even in this moment of weakness, if you didn't grab Ziggs, people were still opting for ADC's. The combination of safe farming/poke, damage, and often times mobility meant that even if Ziggs could wreck them in lane, it was still worth taking one. They didn't get dropped off or anything-which is exactly what WOULD have happened to any other role in a similar situation.\n\nYou talk as if ADC's *have* to be a missile. Why can't they be the Sniper, while the tank is the Support (machine gun), Bruisers use assault rifles, etc. and together, they equally take down the enemy, instead of \"we MUST use the ADC to win. No ADC on our team=loss\" that this game has had for ages? I feel as though your statement there really points out the problem of league-the value of an ADC is too damned high. There is absolutely no reason any one role should overall be considered more valuable than all the others, yet this is exactly what ADC's are.","replies":[{"poster":"Longtowel","date":"2018-01-30T04:35:32.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I understand your position a little better now. \n\nI cerntainly get why you would feel like ADCs are Required and that no other class in the game are as important. \n\nWhat I'd like to think though, is that the thing that is absolutely required is very high sustained damage that is enough to take out an entire team. Of course ADCs are not the only role associated with the capacity to do it, and mind you I mean associated, because for example a full-build crit Yi or a full-build Azir could dish out similarly devastating damage. \n\nBut its just that the way these champions work meant they cannot take up the responsibility of being the core damage dealer. So the evolution of the game has dictated that we needed something that could reliably deal tonnes of damage and that damage is self-contained in a way (so Azir's damage would be too conditional, since he needs to be where he put his soldiers at). That turned into the Marksman class, champions that fulfill that role better than anyone else. \n\nIn terms of pure damage capacity, I think a full-crit Yi would be similar to a full build Vayne. \n\nAnyway, the game has been around for too long and the model of gameplay is quite developed that it is very hard to try to change the core design of the game, because that would mean they need to change everything. \n\nBut its certainly not impossible, if you look at a game like Dota, where carries comes in all shapes and forms. But Dota is, however, very different in how it plays despite being the game that spawned LoL in the first place. \n\nAt the end of the day, it is the 'Carry' in the ADC that matters. If the Marksman can't carry, they are not the ADC. If the midlane is so strong, they are the APC instead. This is why Riot never explicitly called Marksman ADCs, because that is technically not their categorization, it just tends to wind up that way. \n\nPerhaps with some changes, some of the mages could potentially fill the late game hypercarry role? For example Taliyah, who has a decent range spammable spell that deals consistently high damage? Obviously right now that's not how she is tuned, but her concept could potentially work towards that APC role. \n\nZiggs is another one, with his spammable and high damage capacity.\n\nSo I don't think its the problem about ADC's design in general, instead, they are the 'necessary evil' if you will, and filled the Carry role which brings with them a lot of significance and of course, frustration. \n\nI wouldn't mind to see Riot implement something or tune other champions to be Carries, but I understand just how difficult that would be.","replies":[{"poster":"Vectros","date":"2018-01-31T20:42:48.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, obviously we can't have damage so low that no one can kill each other, that'd be obsurd.\n\nI'm fine with ADC's having sustained damage-enough to be the best at killing the tanks. I'm not ok with A) it feels like burst damage to a squishy and B) They tend to reach this insane level rather quickly-and safely to boot. Compared to many melee champs, ADC's have a much safer lane phase. So they're safer+stronger late game=why even bother with using these melee champs? This doesn't always happen-there are some melee's that can stomp ADC's, but as a general rule, the ADC will outpoke and out farm the melee. Hence why some ADC's, such as Vayne and Quinn, are now top lane, because they can. Hell, jungle and mid aren't safe-that's when you know you have a problem.  A class can literally go to any lane and feel at home. Can't say that about anyone else.\n\nAnd yes, some non-adc's *can* out damage an adc-but you don't take them due to risk factor. This doesn't apply as much to low levels, but there's a reason that the likes of Master Yi and Yasuo don't see high level play; the instant they are in range to start doing damage, they get wrecked.\n\nI agree the game has been out for a while, and I'm not necessarily asking for ADC's to hit like a wet noodle. Rather, they need to take longer to reach that point/not be so safe in the early game. Make it somewhat of a risk to play ADC's, so we can actually see Ziggs or other champs bottom to attempt to shut down the ADC. I wouldn't expect it to work every time-but it should be a viable pick, much how literally every other class can be shut down/countered during laning by another role.\n\nHaven't actually played Dota, though from what I've heard, melee ADC's are actually a thing.\n\nWouldn't disagree, but the ADC doesn't need to deal nearly as much damage as it does so quickly.\n\nBasically, they need to either deal less damage late, or be more vulnerable and do less damage early. I don't care how they do it. Also, Your'e wrong on them never calling them ADC's, that used to be their official term until maybe 3-4 years ago, when Marksman became the official title. Prior to that, ADC *was* the official term.\n\nI'd love to see APC's actually be a thing. It has happened from time to time, like Ryze used to do it.\n\nI'd also love to see melee bruisers become late game carries. As is stands, they not only have the most expensive itemization, but often struggle in laning vs other classes. Not always, but it is an issue. To me it'd make sense for them to actually carry late game, at the expense of dangerous early game-and it'd be easier to get focused.","replies":[{"poster":"Longtowel","date":"2018-01-31T23:23:27.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ADCs are hard to play, that's for sure. \n\nFrom my experience playing all the roles, ADC is by far the most difficult mechanically, it requires you to constantly maintain a high APM while keeping in mind all of the other aspects of the game like vision, positioning and target priority. In that sense I feel like they are already a risk. \n\nRight now, I do think that the early safety of the ADCs might be a bit much at higher elos, since people understand trading better and can keep themselves safer. In lower elos its not much of an issue I think, since people make mistakes so often and do dumb stuff so even the slightly superior ADC will be able to get a few kills off of the other one (of course matchup matters). \n\nI think it would be healthy to nerf fleet footwork a little bit, and give ADCs more incentive to use lethal tempo and Press the Attack, which I think are such cool rune choices, and would be so fun to play with more. \n\nI used to love taking lethal tempo on say Vayne or Varus or Kog'maw, and just have a ridiculous attack speed at an early level, and out duel people with that surprise damage. But right now its just not as viable, not because people say it is, but from my own experience as well. In lane especially, if I don't take fleet footwork, my health is just always lower than the enemy laner since I don't get that sustain, and they are generally smart enough to not get into a drawnout fight with me if they see my lethal tempo up.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
