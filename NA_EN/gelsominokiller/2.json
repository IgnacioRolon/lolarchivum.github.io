Previously, Varus was explicitly a warden of the pit of Pallas, so he KNEW what evil was lurking beneath. In the new lore, it is not clear if Valmar is aware of the consequences of his actions: he hopes Kai will be healed and everything will be fine; he&#039;s not signing a pact with a great evil that he knows will consume him. The intent is missing. This takes away a lot from the story. There is no self sacrifice.\r\n\r\nWhat was amazing about Varus&#039; previous lore is that you had this warrior that devoted his life to the protection of a great evil, but also loved his wife and child. He was torn between his duty and his family, (this aspect is nowhere to be found in the new lore), and ultimately decided to leave his wife and child to die slaughtered by the noxians. And for nothing: with his city falling under the siege of the invaders, the power of the pit of Pallas was doomed to fall in noxian hands. Grief and revenge moved him to steal that same power he sworn to protect, in order to get revenge.\r\n\r\nIn the new lore, everything happens so fast there&#039;s no time to meditate such a dramatic decision. Kai is dying faster than a racecar and Kalmar is compelled to save him. Valmar doesn&#039;t actually lose  Kai. He&#039;s not consumed by hate and lust of revenge to the point he&#039;s willing to sacrifice everything.\r\n\r\nTLDR: There is no duty vs family dichotomy. There is no loss. Everything happens fast, and in order to save Kai. There is no intent in releasing the evil form the pit to exact revenge. There is no Varus.","replies":[{"poster":"Autrah Fang","date":"2017-12-01T23:52:46.301+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"a question i have is: why did Valmar go into the pool *with* Kai? i feel like that isn't properly explained. if his sole intention was to save Kai with what he assumed was healing waters, why did he jump in with him? just to be with him to make sure it worked? to plead with whatever god waited beneath? or did he just fall in by accident? i want to at least believe Varus influenced him to do so, but we didn't get enough information to assume any of these reasons.","replies":[{"poster":"GelsominoKiller","date":"2017-12-02T13:54:01.399+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good point. believe that he wanted to avoid Kai drowning, for he was severely wounded and could not keep himself afloat.\n\nMore questionably, why did the darkin fuse with the two of them?

Good writing usually has the characters make decision, not just allow the story to happen to them. One could argue that Valmar \"chose\" to drag them into the pit, but is it a choice really? Was he really gonna just sit there and let Kai die? And as OP says, there's no reason for Valmar to believe this will be mega bad. Nobody dies (not even the mother character), there's no tragedy except some vaguely alluded to tragic backstory for the Darkin himself. Which, if that's the case, why not give some focus to him?\n\nThe couple also doesn't lead us to believe either of them were inclined to want revenge on the Noxians; Maybe if they had, it would have felt like the Darkin was preying on these dark feelings for his own benefit, reinforcing the \"vengeful-ness\" that is essential to Varus' character. And, as OP says, the most interesting aspect of old Varus' lore--duty vs family--is just completely cut. \n\nPeople praise the new lore for being better and adding more, but did it really? Looking back at all the depth that was cut, was there really that much added? And Varus' old lore was a story that desperately needed fleshing out, and yet I feel it had more avenues for storytelling. I feel like their energies could have been better spent fleshing out Varus' relationship with his family and the Darkin, or looking at how Varus deals with the consequences of his choices. Lines like \"I'm on borrowed time\" or \"Beware a man with nothing to lose\" are far more compelling characterization, and are lines that make zero sense now. To top it off, Val and Kai don't really _change_ and don't have a lot of opportunities to do so. They are characterized by loving each other, they still do, that's it. \n\nThe old lore had meaningful choices and consequences that yeah, needed to be fleshed out. The new lore doesn't have meaningful choices, nobody dies, there's not much room for the characters to grow, the end.","replies":[{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-12-01T20:42:28.308+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":9,"body":"Sadly, it has 'gay' people and that makes it 99% better than anything without gay people.\n\nMake old Varus gay, idc.
