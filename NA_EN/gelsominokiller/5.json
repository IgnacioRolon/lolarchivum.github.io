Now me and my sculpted body want revenge via COMMUNIST REVOLUTION\"\n{{champion:145}} \"this super tight latex suit i wear, V-neckline included, is actually an otherwordly parasitic abomination that fuses and feeds with and through my skin. It also gives me superpowers\"\n\n*Now again, i don't have any problem with HOW those above look. I have a problem when comparing said looks with their backstory and their identity. Being so sexy and sharp, Kai'sa kinda kills any \"void survivor\" traits she would like to have, and for Sylas to be straight out of a Calvin Klein commercial kind of ruins the struggles he had to suffer in his long imprisonement. Those elements would provide depth to their personas but in that way they are lost.*\n\n-----------------------\nComing to the expected topic, Kayle presents the same issue in my opinion. While Morgana looks amazing, and her sex appeal is very fitting, the same sex appeal on Kayle is the exact opposite of **what i firmly belive she should be**. I am disappointed but not surprised, because that's not the first time Riot puts a champion's (external) likeability before logic or character cohesion.\n\nKayle has always been an entity outside (and above) of gender. An androgynous figure absorbed in her ideals and purpose. [The parallel with Samus Aran is unavoidable here]. Kayle was strikingly beautiful... angelic regardless of wings **but** completely unintrested in showing her appearence. A winged full-armored knight you could look at, and see only honor, duty, justice, composure, battle prowess and glory. When i first started to play LoL years ago, i first discovered Kayle to be female with her \"unmasked\" skin. Her clash with Morgana was not only about **freedom**, but also about **identity and personal expression**; Morgana's provocative outfit, albeit wretched, was a striking and precious further point of contrast with her sister's total refusal to \"admit\" her femininity.\n\nKayle rework gives her yet another tight latex suit with some armor elements that are even removed as she ascends. She's hotter for sure, and any eteroxesual male could argue that this is an improvement... but does she embody justice as well as she did before? Is Kayle's identity enriched by her newfound femininity, or is it detrimental?","replies":[{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2019-02-18T21:54:36.812+0000","up_votes":62,"down_votes":2,"body":"What I expected:\nhttps://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6YjdYQi4KDActzVo9w2UZ3.jpg\n\nWhat I got:\nhttps://img4.goodfon.com/wallpaper/nbig/3/7a/fentezi-art-angel-angel-vzgliad-krylia.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Frontline Fury","date":"2019-02-19T03:39:25.087+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=A Superb Villain,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=KeYTujMn,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2019-02-18T21:54:36.812+0000)\n>\n> What I expected:\n> https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6YjdYQi4KDActzVo9w2UZ3.jpg\n> \n> What I got:\n> https://img4.goodfon.com/wallpaper/nbig/3/7a/fentezi-art-angel-angel-vzgliad-krylia.jpg\n\nPerfect depiction.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2019-02-19T02:47:56.417+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=A Superb Villain,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=KeYTujMn,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2019-02-18T21:54:36.812+0000)\n>\n> What I expected:\n> https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6YjdYQi4KDActzVo9w2UZ3.jpg\n> \n> What I got:\n> https://img4.goodfon.com/wallpaper/nbig/3/7a/fentezi-art-angel-angel-vzgliad-krylia.jpg\n\nThat's an insult to the woman, who looks amazing here.","replies":[{"poster":"Gay7Deer","date":"2019-02-20T03:03:58.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"??? its a drawing, the woman doesn't exist.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2019-02-20T04:09:38.101+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Gay7Deer,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=KeYTujMn,comment-id=000400000000,timestamp=2019-02-20T03:03:58.994+0000)\n>\n> ??? its a drawing, the woman doesn't exist.\n\nAre you dense?

Any foreigner that sees the old kayle would think she's some sort of spartan or soldier instead of an angel.\n\nNo, old Kayle was very clearly angelic with her wings and angelic magic. The only thing further angelic in the new rework is just additional wings.\n\n> Plus, logically thinking, it would be very difficult to fly around with armor that heavy and a helmet with barely any visibility. It just wouldn't make sense for an angel to be as guarded as a normal feeble soldier would with no ability other than walking.\n\nArmor is a symbol of a warrior. If your wearing it, you are probably a warrior. Why would our _warrior_ angel be unable to handle the weight of armor? She does in her current iteration.\n\n> Kayle calls swords while flying, hits from a distance, and the likes. She does not really need the extra armor. She needs the breather to maneuver and fly more freely as far as logic goes.\n\nAgain, this isn't about realism. This is about communicating the character's lore. \n\n> Its not like she's naked either, she barely shows any skin aside from her face and shoulders. All she wore was a tight suit and some armor covering her arms and legs + the helmet. Quit overreacting to something so stupid.\n\nHer character design _is stupid_. Its so focused on giving people boners that it forgot the whole narrative point about Kayle, about her beliefs, and about her connection to Morgana. \n\nLook, I'm not saying Kayle doesn't look angelic. I'm not saying \"REEEE ITS NOT REALISTIC!!!!\". I'm not saying she needs to be ugly or in a burka. What I _am_ saying is that Kayle's theme is about uniformity, order, and unity. Regardless of how constrictive of the individual, she was the faceless, genderless extension of Justice. Morgana contrasted this by being the sexually and physically free angel of individuality and self expression. Now Kayle too is sexually and physically free, with plenty of self expression and feminine expression that makes very little sense with her lore and theme. That was an intended dynamic between the two characters and now its gone. If you can't recognize that kind of analysis then we aren't going to come to any sort of answer or agreement.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
