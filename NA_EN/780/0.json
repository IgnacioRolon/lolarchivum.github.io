Reset router/computer. Sent in ticket to rito with trace log. Apparently this isn't just an ISP issue. Living in Alberta, using Shaw.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-25T16:33:25.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ping issues like this can be caused by network issues like a poor connection or packet losses.  How your ISP reaches the game servers may have also changed, and the traceroute you mentioned should help pinpoint that.  Until a tech specialist reaches out, I recommend using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help troubleshoot this.  This will help rule out possibilities with local network issues.  Good luck!","replies":[]}]}
