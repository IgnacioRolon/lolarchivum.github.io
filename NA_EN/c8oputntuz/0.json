So I have to dodge and loose 10 LP with 30 minute penalty. Worst is previously this occured during a series. Riot, this is a problem and I am loosing unnecessary LP from it. Is there a way for me to recover this 10 LP at the very least? I don't like that my previous game that I worked hard to win for became a waste of time.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-25T18:09:54.034+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because disconnecting from a champion select lobby negatively impacts everyone in the match, regardless of the reason for the disconnection, all disconnections are treated equally. This is one of the ideas behind why penalties, such as low priority queues and lost LP cannot be removed or modified. \n\nThere are a number of reasons why your client may be crashing during champ select, however, the most common is an unstable connection to the servers. When there's a drop in the client, you can see delays in actions taken in champ select and in some cases your client can disconnect from the platform entirely and your game will crash. The guide that *Rineyy* linked addresses the most common solutions for this issue.\n\nIf you still have issues after working through the guide, let me know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Me vs World","date":"2016-09-08T23:39:53.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sick of this, happened to me twice today in 5 games.\nIt is not connectivity issues as i have 160 gb fibre optic and my ping never EVER moves from 22.\nIn total I must have lost around 1000 lp from these lobby crashes....
