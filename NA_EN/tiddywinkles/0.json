I am currently sitting at 999 normal wins and wanted my 1000th win to be something special from the company. I ended up opening a ticket and player support redirected me here. Should there be a better method to get in contact with Riot employees to play those big milestone games? Would people be interested in playing with a Rioter for their big milestones?\r\n\r\np.s. this is a shameless attempt to get a Rioter to notice me and go for that 1k win milestone","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-29T22:22:43.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whew, we used to do this often back when League was still a small community.  It's hard to do these now that the scale is so large, but I'm up for a game.  I may be able to grab some fellow support members too.  I'm free for the next hour, if you're available for a game!  And grats on your progress.  :D","replies":[{"poster":"TiddyWinkles","date":"2017-09-29T22:26:17.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds amazing!
