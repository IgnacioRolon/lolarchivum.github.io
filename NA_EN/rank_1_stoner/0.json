Although, some of the times it fails is because teammates see it as a troll; and then we end up getting reported. I find that many people are still stuck on this &quot;meta&quot; idea, when riot has made it clear that the game is meant to be played a variation of ways. Is there a solution to help players like us? \r\n\r\nI feel that double jungle can be viable and valuable to the team, but only with solid communication and teamwork. Perhaps riot could create a story for the community to help promote better awareness of  different and new strategies!","replies":[{"poster":"Ratpocalypse","date":"2018-02-21T05:17:24.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that LoL should be played with various strategies such as, Double Jungle, Double Mid, Triple Bot(maybe even Top?!)

I don't even...) There's even more of them flipping out in teambuilder. I can't even get a freakin' botlane to stay without a dedicated support. How am I suppose to get a support? People are queuing for support even LESS (which is saying something), because let's face it, NO ONE NEEDS A SUPPORT ANYMORE.\n\nI too, have done double jungle, and it's a lot of fun, even when I queue for two jungles, but am not one of them (solo-botdonger4life.) And it works just as often as not with a team of randoms, just like everything ELSE works as often as not with a team of randoms. But try to tell that to people who gawk at LCS games all day and try to take the simplest, dumbest observation they can make about pro strats and treat it as law, life, and the key to success in all of League, period.","replies":[]}]}
