You generally design a champion to be used for something in particular, Shen's global presence as an example. Now, obviously Shen has a lot more going on than just that, but let's just simplify this real fast. If you don't balance for the situation in which Shen is strong (coordinated play) then he becomes overwhelming, which results in a point where he's pretty much pick or ban in high enough level play - which we've seen happen to Shen before. \n\nHowever, Shen cannot usually accomplish what makes him pick/ban worthy in a solo queue environment so he generally languishes somewhere between \"bad\" \"somewhat usable\" and \"decent\" there. Rarely higher or lower. He's kinda like Io or Abyssal Underlord in DotA2: he can be fine in solo queue, but coordinated competitive play is where he shines, and like Underlord and Io, history has proven that Shen tends to be balanced around the situations he's strong in, otherwise he can become overbearing in the situation in which he's actually really good just to make him feel really good in solo queue. \n\nThey have to do that for champions like Shen. For him to be good in one place means he absolutely will dominate the scene in the other place. It's happened before.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-04-06T14:32:11.871+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"but here's the thing. balance should never be dictated by top play.\nLiterally never.\n\nBecause in top play they are going to exclusively pick the best things. they spend the most time testing, and therefore are the most likely to find those little things that end up breaking the game in one way or another, and they are also the most co-ordinated, so they can pull off things that can be nearly impossible even for full teams of players.\n\nThis is totally normal though, lcs should be expected to be able to pull out the best from any champion.\nand for some champions the best should be higher than others. but just because the best should be higher doesn't mean that average players should end up with hot garbage on a stick for it.\n\nRiot should be balanceing almost exclusively for the average players. the players that have around 50-100 hours on a champ in the bronze to diamond spectrum. of course there needs to be easy champs as well. but focusing on super high tier play is a waste because it won't matter up there, unless you break something intrinsic.","replies":[{"poster":"Anidan","date":"2017-04-07T00:35:02.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Going to be honest: that just sounds like a difference in opinion rather than an actual fact. If you don't pay heed to what the pros and other high-skill players are doing in terms of balance then your competitive scene is literally worthless - it becomes a showcase of what they can break the hardest based on community whims (which it partly is now, but that's because Riot doesn't balance exclusively for pro play or casual play). If you balance around those that haven't put in as much time it's very easy to create something incredibly broken for people who _have_ put in the time. That's incredibly important to remember. \n\nI'm not going to say you have to balance completely one way or the other in casual vs. pro play, but remember that there is no factual basis in saying how they should balance, only opinion. And our opinions happen to disagree. I prefer a balance that focuses on people who put in the time and effort to master the champion and its limits, and you believe otherwise. It is what it is. \n\nHowever, some champion designs themselves do lend themselves toward being balanced toward higher level play. Shen is one of those designs. In Solo Queue his value is going to be a crapshoot, while in competitive it's going to be much more stable. It's far easier to balance him for higher level where his performance is generally more reliable than lower skill players because they can break someone like Shen for him to be usable at that level. That's Shen's design.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-04-07T16:01:41.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No.\n\nCould give you a long string but I'm not sure you could understand it, the previous post already shows that you failed to make correct jumps in logic, and for the sake of not arguing further with your bad leaps I'm just out.","replies":[{"poster":"Anidan","date":"2017-04-08T02:56:30.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So... you're taking the \"I'm smarter than I perceive you to be, so I'm not going to continue\" end? Legitimate question: If you perceive someone to be less able to make the 'correct' jumps in logic and so you disregard them how exactly do you think they'll get better at making said correct leaps? \n\nAnd also: I'm sorry that you think balance shouldn't be directed at high level play, but no, it should to an extent. If I had to choose one (1) type of player to balance for, it's the top players - because they're actually good enough to properly utilize the tools they're given. If I make a champion designed for coordinated play (Shen) then why would I balance him without coordinated high-level play in mind and instead make him usable in a level of play low enough that they can't properly take advantage of his strengths? Again, this is if I had to choose one (1) type of person to balance for in regards to specific champions. For champions _designed for coordinated play_ they should be balanced around said coordinated play, preferably at a high level because they're capable of utilizing that champion to his fullest potential. You can balance a whole game around as many people as possible, but after a while you have to admit that certain champions simply have to be balanced around different skill levels - Shen is one of those champions. He will simply never be as valuable in uncoordinated play as he is in high level coordinated play, assuming viability in his current balance. This means to prevent warping higher level play to the point that he shoves out other picks, he can't be balanced around lower-skill uncoordinated play without keeping high-level play in mind.\n\nAnyway, balancing according to the whims of a community, I've learned, is an absolutely terrible idea. \n\nNow, you say can give a list of points, well, why don't you?
