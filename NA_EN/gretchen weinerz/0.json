The bots usually have a name like \"Joan\" which is either preceded or followed by a random combination of letters with every other letter capitalized. THey they always buy boots first and go to a random lane (4 could go to one lane) they \"b\" when at about 33% percent life then pick another random lane. THey also rarely attack towers and use abilities randomly without rhyme or reason. Over the past couple weeks it has turned from 1-2 on a team to now having 4 bots on my team. I'm usually still able to win despite this, but it's not without work.\r\n\r\nI have been reporting them for botting, but nothing seems to happen. Are these bots allowed as they greatly diminish the experience of players? Has anyone else experienced this?\r\n\r\nHappy New Year! Hope it's fetch.\r\n\r\nGretchen","replies":[{"poster":"Inkling Commando","date":"2019-12-29T13:53:32.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"just do what you do when a troll is in your game, play around them. since trolls and bots are one and the same.","replies":[{"poster":"Jennifer17","date":"2019-12-29T15:06:03.136+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"thats as wrong as you can get lol","replies":[{"poster":"Inkling Commando","date":"2019-12-29T15:10:33.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jennifer17,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=gkV17wdQ,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-12-29T15:06:03.136+0000)\n>\n> thats as wrong as you can get lol\n\nI bet you can't tell the difference between a troll and a bot.","replies":[{"poster":"Jennifer17","date":"2019-12-29T15:21:55.610+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah its really hard to tell the difference between someone who follows you around the jungle and tries to steal all your camps and one person with heal ghost, default runes and itembuilds that never enters the jungle and generally always has the same score and behavior.\n\nim by far not qualified enough to spot the difference between a cat and a cheetah either.\n\nhow fucking stupid do you think humans are? man thats an insult, you treat us like we're about as smart as a piece of shit.","replies":[{"poster":"Inkling Commando","date":"2019-12-29T15:30:18.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jennifer17,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=gkV17wdQ,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2019-12-29T15:21:55.610+0000)\n>\n> yeah its really hard to tell the difference between someone who follows you around the jungle and tries to steal all your camps and one person with heal ghost, default runes and itembuilds that never enters the jungle and generally always has the same score and behavior.\n\na troll is capable of doing the same build as a so-called-bot and you wouldn't know the difference. as such you cannot call someone a bot when they could in fact be a troll.\n> \n> im by far not qualified enough to spot the difference between a cat and a cheetah either.\n\nirrelevant\n\n> \n> how fucking stupid do you think humans are? man thats an insult, you treat us like we're about as smart as a piece of shit.\n\nyou'd be surprised how dumb humans are.","replies":[{"poster":"Jennifer17","date":"2019-12-29T15:35:18.503+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"honestly idk what to say. i've never seen a troll move/behave the same way as a bot. not once lol.\nespecially since bots dont go into ranked as they get sold at level 30. but w/e.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MordridtheBlack","date":"2019-12-29T13:50:54.844+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is a thing\nthey are swarming SR now that TT is gone\n\nand sadly there isn't much Riot can do about the bots\nfor every bot they take down another 5-10 can easily take its place\n\nyour best bet is get out of co-op vs ai asap and only play it if u need to finish off a quest that you'd rather not do in a match made game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Prothello","date":"2019-12-29T16:45:58.650+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they should negate the penalty for dodging, in co-op vs AI games only, to combat this problem. I don't know if permanent IP bans will fix it (since the creation of bots vs the destruction of bots ratio is in favor of bots being around forever) but it could be a viable option as well. At least to help do some damage control. It's true that since TT went down there's been a massive influx of bots in the bot games. i personally used the co-op vs AI mode to learn new champs; and now, unfortunately, that's all but a memory since its basically carry practice, now that the bots have moved in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordPickleton","date":"2020-01-04T02:57:43.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just do what I do: Check the number of bots when you're in champ select.

It takes literally _months_ of FWotD bonuses and/or _hundreds_ of co-op games to be rocking the levels some of these bots are rocking.\n\nFor these bots to get that far, Rito has to be basically sitting on their hands doing **NOTHING** about them.\n\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}} \n\n - - -\n\nIf Rito were actually bothering to detect and to ban these bots, then setting level requirements for higher \"difficulty\" (haha) co-op might give players the option to use higher \"difficulty\" co-op relatively free from bots for testing and such, and only Intro and such would be flooded with new bots on their way to their eventual bans.\n\nHowever, since bots are allowed free reign in LoL, going months and/or hundreds of games without bans, that's not really an option.\n\n{{sticker:sg-janna}} \n\n - - -\n\nThe really sad part is that half of these bots actually qualify for Ranked play.
