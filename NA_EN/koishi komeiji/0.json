I send a ticket to riot and I got my account back but I'm wondering if the hacker can send a ticket and get into my account again. I have the original email and I dont think he can get into it because I've put phone security and stuff. \r\n\r\nI'm really nervous because I spend around 1000$ on it and just the thought that someone went into my account got me scared as hell. \r\nSo I'm asking again, is it possible for them to get access to my account again by any means other than going into my email or sending a fake ticket to riot support?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-02T18:25:16.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as you've updated and secured your information, you should be fine.
