I get constant frame drops. And my ping went up to 80. The same as the LAN server which is kind of sad. You maintenance did nothing to improve connectivity, or any issues. Only brought up more for me. It got to the point where I use Haste now because it lowers my ping. Not advertising but seriously. It got to THAT point.
