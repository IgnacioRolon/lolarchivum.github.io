They are weak on their own. \n\nGaren and Sion's infinite stacking passives only become a problem if you allow it to be as they only gain it via farming and they'd need to farm a lot for a noticeable effect. \n\nJinx's standard passive only activates when an objective or kill is taken and jinx participated. It's situational and only serves to allow jinx to clean up fights rather then dominate. \n\nZed has always gotten shit for his passive, people just hate his ult more.\n\nThresh's passive is, like garen and sion before, only a problem if you let it go unchecked. In exchange for no scaling armor, he gets a small amount of armor and ap permanently for collecting souls of which he has no control over when they spawn outside of large monsters/cannons/champions \n\nBottom line is, the \"extra\" passives often are situational and require just as much setup as execution.(except zed but no one likes him either)\n\nYasuo' passive give him free Crits, ms, and a shield and the only cost is a crit damage reduction of 10% which is immediately off set by an infinity edge which is a core item.

His passive is indeed strong, but cost is his overall dps. Jhin is a marksman that deals damage in burst as opposed to his peers who do so through dps. This is meaningful when dealing with tanks who are accustom to dealing with burst making him rather weak to tanks, and before you even speak of lethality nonsense, Jhin is the only adc who SHOULDN'T build it since his passive rewards crit builds far more then lethality.\n\nAs for Yasuo, I poorly attributed his mobility to his passive instead of his e (my bad) but my overall point remains the same, though I will reiterate as it seems it went misunderstood. Yasuo's passive is annoying due to how it gives him far more damage and survivability then he technically should and its incredibly frustrating as yasuo does very little for his power. Yes, he statically \"pays\" for his passive by having weaker base stats overall, but that isn't conveyed to his opponent in game through any notable means. His health bar, visually is around the same length as yours and taking damage in the early game hurts equally hard. Its only in the highest of tiers that Yasuo's sacrifices become truly noticeable. \n\nI should mention that I don't consider Yasuo OP. In-fact I kinda consider him weak overall. The Massive load he can be towards his team at times, the way he subtly punishes his team for not putting him first in team comp decisions, and the whole house of cards nature of his play style (i.e. he either wins or loses big with no real middle ground) puts him firmly in this position for me. I only contest that he is in essence in a similar position as teemo.

She ends with +70 HP and -2 health regen over Yasuo.  Yasuo BEGINS with a 100 HP shield (so +30 HP) and ends with a 510 shield (ie. +440 HP on Kat)\n\nSomething else to note, since the shield is basically \"functional\" HP (blocks all damage including true damage), this means the following:\nAt Rank 1, Yasuo gains flow at a rate of 1 per 59 units moved.  Yasuo base movement is 345, so Yasuo gains ~6 flow per second, or takes 17 seconds to regain his shield.  Kat (just as example) has +1 HP regen on Yasuo for 7.5 HP per 5 secs (way it works).  \n\nThat means, if both take half health in an early trade, Yasuo is at 259 HP and Kat is at 295.  In 17 secs, Yasuo will be at 281 HP and Kat will be at 321 HP (320.5 rounded up).  But Yasuo's shield will be back, but him at 381 \"effective\" health, to Kat's 321.  And looked at fully, it'd go more like this:\nStart of lane:\nYasuo = 518 HP + 100 HP shield = 618 functional HP\nKatarina = 590 HP\n\nAssuming no equipment (not getting into builds or whatever) with 1 Q and 3 AAs we get this:\nYasuo -> 129.9 (AA dmg (accounting for base armor)) + 20 (Q dmg) = 150 HP dmg to Kat\nKat -> 140.5 (AA dmg (accounting for base armor)) + 75 (Q dmg) - 100 (shield) = 116 HP dmg to Yasuo\n\nKat has -34 HP deficit after 3 AAs (+Q), again, in 17 secs, Kat will regain about 26 HP, Yasuo will \"effectively\" regain 122 HP.\nSo, despite starting the game with higher: HP, HP regen, Armor, Base Attack Damage, PLUS having a Q that does more than triple the dmg of Yasuo's, Kat will be at a DEFICIT of -30 HP ACTUAL health, and -130 \"effective\" health at 17 seconds simply because of Yasuo's shield passive.\n\n*Note, Q is Kat's highest lvl 1 dmg spell and (aside from 0 dmg Windwall) Yasuo's lowest, and since the shield scales with level, these only get worse as the champs go up, considering that all of their base stats either scale at basically the same rate OR in Yasuo favor (HP regen for Yasuo higher at Level 18)","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2017-04-04T18:36:23.278+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You seem to be disregarding the ease with which most mid-laners can pop his shield, including kat.
