League caters to a casual audience which can't be bothered to put any thought into builds and strategies. Unlike Riot, Valve doesn't assume its playerbase are complete fucking retards and allows them the luxury of innovating the game without external interference to prevent anything new from hurting the feelings of metasheep.","replies":[{"poster":"InvalidGuest","date":"2014-10-07T05:38:56.875+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well, that's just like, your opinion man.\n\nAlso no one's goddamn forcing you to play this game, go play DOTA is you enjoy it more, eveyone's entitled to their own opinion and that is perfectly respectable if you like the other game better.

Since then the quality of the service Riot offers has only steadily gone down. They've blatantly lied to their playerbase and shifted the focus of development to esports at the cost of servers that don't  frequently crash and the production of content that the general playerbase can experience and enjoy.\n\nI used to think Riot was a great small company with a fun Dota-like game that I enjoyed. They slowly changed that opinion by getting shittier and shittier. Here I am now venting on the shitty boards that they replaced the actual forums with that nobody wanted them to do. Riot has become a shitty company and the quality of their game has followed suit.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Marenjii","date":"2014-10-07T05:27:23.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oooh sick burn bro.
