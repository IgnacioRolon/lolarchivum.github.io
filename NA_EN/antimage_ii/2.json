The GD community from the original forums was migrated into GD on the Boards, and people that want to talk about the other things you mentioned have other boards they can go to:\n\nEsports - Esports\nLore - Story & Art\nStrategy - Tips & Tricks or Gameplay & Balance, depending on the thread\nDominion - Maps & Modes\nHelp & Support - Help & Support\n\n>A large chunk of the community doesnt want to use the leddit style outside of GD because the chronological view is ruined by nested replies. If two conversations are active in nested, its near impossible to follow.\n\nThis is something they are working on, to my knowledge.  It's a difficult thing to set up, because Discussion view needs to match Chronological view in the information provided without cluttering either.\n\n>Also these forums are slow to load, clunky, still buggy, and doesn't work on most mobile and tablets.\n\nPersonally, I've noticed that the Boards is way faster than the old forums, and it also doesn't crash pretty much every day.

You mean as opposed to before where everything was in GD and wasn't even categorized at all? I'm sure others can speak for me as well, but any non-GD forum was painfully empty and slow with discussion and not very good if you wanted to talk about things to a lot of people. Now we have the best of both worlds: mainstream traffic sees it, and also people interested in that topic see it.

Certainly it had all types of conversation but to write off the other subsets as void is a complete false. The help and support, lore, roleplaying, games and dominion alone are a testament to that. Are they as busy as GD? Of course not, but at least those specific tabs allowed them to not be lost in a sea of GD, as they all are now. \n\nI will reinstate my point that the chronological view is near impossible to read right now if there is any nested conversations taking place. Someone butting into a conversation about \" Well they way to counter teem shrooms is xxxxx\" in the middle of a chronological discussion that has switched to Skarners jungle capabilities is distracting, and when this happens 4-5 times from other subjects it is derailed and lost in confusion on what is actually being discussed. A soon isn't an acceptable rebuttal either because this has been discussed at length since beta and nothing was done to address it.  \n\nMeanwhile those active forum goers are just told: Sucks for you. You are SOL. \n\nSee the problem and why many posters are actively irritated by the stance of these boards?","replies":[{"poster":"AbiwonKenabi","date":"2014-10-07T22:15:40.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Everything was in GD?

Otherwise you usually got a few replies and that was it. So everything was just lost in the sea of GD anyways. With this format, you get both categorized in individual topics and you are seen by the general public. If you don't want to look at *everything* you click a category you *are* interested in and you just look at that.\n\nWhat I *would* like to see is a checkbox system: a system where you can select which categories it shows you currently so if you don't want to see, say, champ concepts or art, you can uncheck those.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Raptamei","date":"2014-10-07T08:15:53.192+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Horrible and unclear visuals.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GranspearZX","date":"2014-10-07T00:35:20.043+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":10,"body":"Because it's new and different.\n\nThat's easily 70% of the complaints.
