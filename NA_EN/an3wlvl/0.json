No lag at all, everything running smoothingly until tonight. So i played all afternoon took a break and left to go get something to eat I come home, turn my pc on as usual. I get ready to join a game. i get through champ select. I buy my starting items i run down lane to wait for minions to spawn... then all of a sudden my ms is showing 16000, my champion appears to be running backwards every action i make is delayed by full SECONDS i disconnect, i reconnect, i disconnect again and i re connect again. \r\n   Nothing has changed about my computer or internet. I haven't changed anything. Nothing but the league of legends client running. ( besides the normal crap that runs in the background on windows.) Nothing changed  so why the sudden lagg and weird client problem? please help. I love the game. Have already put way too much time and money into it to give up. Please help me with a fix.\r\n   Before you ask. it's not my internet or the computer specs. cuz they are all fine and up to date and like i said i was playing fine only hours before this started happening","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-26T21:00:48.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That specific type of lag is most likely being caused by packet loss. Essentially bits of data are getting lost while going between your network and our servers, causing it to look like your champion is moving backwards or acting on their own.
