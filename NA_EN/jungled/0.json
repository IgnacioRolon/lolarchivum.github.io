Blitzcrank lets out a hiss of steam as he sets his coolant to full power. Tahm attempts to initiate the fight with his tongue, extending it out and whipping Blitzcrank across the chest. It bounces off harmlessly. Blitzcrank fires his hand, grabbing Tahm Kench by the front of his overcoat and dragging him in. They fight each other for hours, Tahm continually body-slamming and whipping to no avail, and Blitzcrank punching madly, attempting to find weak points in Tahm's thick skin. Tahm grows tired, but Blitzcrank cannot feel exhaustion. Blitzcrank punches Tahm in the stomach with incredible force, activating his gag reflex and throwing him to the ground. A helmet, covered in blood and digestive juices, bounces high in the air and lands on Blitzcrank's front, the powerful stomach acids tearing a hole through Blitz's reinforced armour. Tahm, in a final strain, bites through Blitzcrank, tearing off his right arm. Tahm, mustering all his energy, throws Blitzcrank into his mouth and swallows him. He pulls a simple hourglass out of his coat pocket, and breaks it, pouring sand of pure gold onto his head. There is a brilliant flash of warm light, and then Tahm falls over, defeated. His mouth opens slightly, and small shards of metal, along with various bolts and wires, fall on the ground in front of him. Completely spent, he lies there, reflecting on the battle. He closes his eyes and summons up magical power that teleports him back to his base.
