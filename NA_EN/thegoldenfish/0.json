Running as Admin, -> Doesn't work.\r\n2. Re-install the game, -> Doesn't work.\r\n3. Right Click > Properties > Compatibility Mode, -> Doesn't work\r\n4. Doing this:\r\n>  \"Open up the “RADS” folder.\r\n> Open up the “Projects” folder.\r\n> Open up the “lol_air_client” folder.\r\n> Open up the “releases” folder.\r\n> Open up the folder that’s in there. It changes every patch, but contains the same stuff.\r\n> Delete the two files named “S_OK” and “release manifest”\r\n> Open up the “deploy” folder.\r\n> Delete the “logs”, “META-INF”, “lol.properties”, and “LoLClient.exe”\r\n> Restart your Patcher.\"\r\n\r\n-> Doesn't work.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Restarting my computer -> Doesn't work.\r\n\r\nCould anyone please help me to fix my League of legends since I really like this game and would like to keep playing it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nDaniel.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-04T16:51:07.631+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for all the troubleshooting you've done so far to resolve this.  The error you are receiving is commonly due to a setting in your OS preventing the patcher from launching and scanning files.  If running as admin didn't solve it, something else could preventing this access.  I recommend going through our [permissions ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions)guide for some additional steps that haven't been tried yet.  Let me know if you continue to have issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Master Nir","date":"2016-09-01T20:30:44.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your support is so bad. It seems this problem is happening to many people in the last month (since the last windows update). This has nothing to do with permissions or running the game as admin. I followed your permissions intructions and it doesn't work. You have a serious bug in your luncher. You should be aware of it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ziggity","date":"2016-08-05T15:56:00.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello!\n\nHaving the same exact issue here and no sucess in resolving it after trying every single solution suggested in this thread.
