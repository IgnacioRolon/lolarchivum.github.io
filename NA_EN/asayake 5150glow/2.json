Also, she often outdps's me with her passive and low Q cooldown (once it gets ranked up), so should I go more glass cannon/burst based so I can get through her E shield and kill her before her Q comes up to reposition her ball? Ori's burst is damn scary as a glass cannon though, so I would juke her ball and try to kill her before her Q comes up again... correct?\n\n> 2. Use range.\n> Orianna is a mid range mage.

Her Q hitbox is also pretty big, and while it can be juked, it's probably not gonna happen on her second Q cast (once your mobility is blown). Her R isn't too small either.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Viktor Von Lazer","date":"2017-04-15T23:06:33.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chaoswlkr,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=RKbMc9wk,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2017-04-15T22:15:36.240+0000)\n>\n> Ori main gonna tell you how to kill ori\n> \n> 1.

You see Orianna's damage early lvls is moderate, but not overpowering. she can chunk repeatedly till she gets you in that sweet spot for her to ult. But Diana's actually kind of tanky with her shield, and once Diana reaches 6 if she lands a Q and all ins, Orianna is  either dead (if she's low) or losing her barrier and cause of your own shield if she full combos she's NOT killing you. an Orianna without items is NOT killing a Diana any time soon unless you eat like EVERY Q before you both reach 6, in which case that's more you than Orianna being strong. \n\nOrianna has the advantage over Ahri pre 6, although it is for the most part an even match up, but once 6 comes, if you're good with Ahri, Orianna CAN'T all in you. She just can't. If she tries to Q R W then you just ult dash around her land a charm full combo, ignite weaving in auto and she's probably dead if she's not near full health. How Orianna wins is by you making a mistake. So many times an Ahri has the ball placed at the back and to the left or right of them. I mark what creep they are going to cs and once the go in to start the autoattack which you can tell from the animation - QRW- dead Ahri. They could have dodged it, but they were focused on the CS and not the ball, and you can tell.  Having said that, you have to be pretty patient and wait for a charm or right moment to flash or ult charm. If it's just a farm lane roam and your roams are way better than orianna's snowball other lanes but keep in mind that You'll probably be outscaled if you just farm it out.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Viktor Von Lazer","date":"2017-04-17T03:03:14.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This video is still relevant. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3c5b4w0rC4 \nBasically the champions listed in the \"midlaners to avoid as Orianna\" is what you want to play.\nIn case you don't want to look at the video these are the champions mentioned.

Don't go leblanc and just farm when you can go Xerath poke her and scale just as well as she does. Ahri i still think is the best pick into her, because it's pretty even for most of the game with a slight advantage to Ahri, and pick potential that never really goes away because of charm (zed etc, not enough damage = no kill but charm and someone can follow up.)

As long as you can predict when she is going to ult you can dodge it, I mean if she is getting close on you and keeps walking to you when you are out of position you can tell she wants to ult you, then if you see her ball come at you just speedily walk out of the way. Keep mouse close to your champion so you can quickly direct where to move. If In draft pick and the enemy midlaner chooses Orianna, I would not go with anyone that doesn't have good movement speed or any gap closing abilities ie: Syndra, Morgana, Lux, or  Cassiopeia, I personally pick Ahri because when she goes all in I use my R to go in on her, because for Orianna to go in she has to literally put herself in a super vulnerable position by casting her Ball away from her losing the passive resistances and now she has for travel time to shield herself or speed herself up, so when she Q's and is gonna R W explode you just ult towards her quickly using two charges of Ahri's R and a quick W-E charm and she's basically dead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"nachocheeseeeee","date":"2017-04-15T21:52:03.661+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"She's immobile.
