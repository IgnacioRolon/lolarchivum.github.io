I am just saying she is not as OP as people say. So yes my opinion may seemed a bit biased but you once again do not show that you have the know how to deal with her YET.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Darth Pixy Misa","date":"2015-01-22T20:36:31.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They best way to fight riven is dont give her kills in lane. Ask for a gank get ahead then play safe. Riven is a non factor in team fights if you starve her during laneing. If the Op plays Zed a lot like lol king says, they should not be having problems with fighting riven........","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brorelia","date":"2015-01-22T20:28:01.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you look at riven as what she was actually created to be\n\nA melee attack damage carry then she seems completely fine for that.\n\nBut everyone said bruiser and a bruiser is not suppose to be a late game hyper scaling monster based on what the meta game says.\n\nBut the meta game is not health in the big scheme of things. It makes one class more valued then another and makes it much harder for telling if one kind of champion say ranged AD is too strong compared to assassins or fighters.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frost the Reaper","date":"2015-01-22T20:12:43.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly there is no real way to fix a Burst Fighter.... I mean yeah you \"could\" take off one of her CC's, but then again that'd make her a little to easy to fight...

I like the stun though its some what reliable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rustling Bush","date":"2015-01-22T20:04:05.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"remember when riven got nerfed and everyone thought she was trash now... good times","replies":[]}]}
