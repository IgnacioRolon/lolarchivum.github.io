To riot, this is a grey zone area. a do at your own risk kind of thing. the only time when modding is bannable is when it gives you an unfair advantage, such as infinite IP/RP, aiming tools, infinite gold etc etc etc. things that give you a huge unfair advantage. And texture modding is....well...textures. and it doesn't give you a unfair advantage since it only applies to you, and not them, since your files are different than theirs and it's just altered pictures. so if you did a Project: {{champion:103}}  skin mod, you will see it, but others will see only the selected skin. So it is TECHNICALLY legal, but it's one of those Do-At-Your-Own-Risk kind of things.","replies":[{"poster":"HAMDIRHOUMA12","date":"2018-02-21T06:46:54.954+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"that mod cant give you advantage you are the only one can  see it .","replies":[{"poster":"Kitsunes Lust","date":"2018-02-22T01:49:13.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HAMDIRHOUMA12,realm=EUW,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=NhsRuseQ,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2018-02-21T06:46:54.954+0000)\n>\n> that mod cant give you advantage you are the only one can  see it .\n\nno. Its a texture mod. it's like saying using pool party Zac gives you an unfair advantage. it's a skin. Skins do not generally give you an advantage. (only skins being things like commando lux i think. the skins that are banned in pro play because it's hard to see spells or something like that) it is just changing the textures on only your side. Say if you use classic Zac and mod it to be a custom skin. you can see that skin, but they can only see origional skin. there is no advantage in that because it's not giving you any kind of advantage. because they see a normal skin. Texture modding is just that it's just modding body textures for JUST YOU. THEY will see Classic Lux, but you will see Dark Star Lux, for example. nothing more, nothing less. texture modding is litterally just changing the appearance, like how some games allow you to change the way your character looks. is that an unfair advantage? no.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ASHTI13","date":"2017-05-01T09:58:30.503+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i used lol mod skin in the past but now even if i deleted it i still get a skin whenever i enter a game help plz {{summoner:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"Already CÃ ncer","date":"2017-06-22T21:58:39.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go to C you will Find a folder it's name LolTrollMode delete it and all will be fine","replies":[{"poster":"MaKaGeLi","date":"2018-01-17T23:10:08.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how to c my coumputer \nyas","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zed Help Me","date":"2018-01-02T21:03:29.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went to c but i couldn't find the loltrollmode folder can you help me?
