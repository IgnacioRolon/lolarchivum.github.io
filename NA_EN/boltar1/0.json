Here is how","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":80,"down_votes":6,"body":"I decided to make a test on verbal abuse report. for 15 games I asked everyone nicely in champ select and after the game to report me for verbal abuse to see if there is any type of oversight on this report. There is None. \n\nI got chat restrictions for 10 games and not once said a word in global chat, in game chat etc. There is zero oversight on this feature. So yes you can troll everyone with this. Its absurd the lack of effort in trying to make the game clean and fun. Anyway if you want to randomly get people chat restricted just report verbal abuse. Doesn't matter if they never say a thing in chat. Maybe if we get enough abuse on this feature riot will change this so someone at least looks at the reports. \n\nAfter chat restrictions of 10 games/20games etc you will get banned. So go Trolling.","replies":[]}
