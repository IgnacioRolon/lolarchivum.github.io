When I go to *owned* it says I own nothing. I&#039;m not sure what happened or what I should do.\n\n I still have a good amount of IP and RP left, but it seems silly that I should have to take the time to buy all the skins again  and spend more of the rp when I have already spent it...","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-14T18:16:10.252+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"As others have mentioned, this was intentionally done to help with testing of the new features - Crafting and the Loot System.","replies":[{"poster":"Saiyu","date":"2016-01-16T22:28:51.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, figured it out, thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-19T17:46:17.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You got it!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2016-01-14T17:36:57.175+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay... here's what you should do. **First,** go to the **PBE Community** boards page. Then, go to where you see a \"!\" icon at the top right corner... click on it. The second thing listed should explain everything. **Please tell this to anyone else confused.**\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you want to get back champions during this time, go to the shop menu, stay on the **Featured** page, and scroll down. There should be 3 items listed; you can either buy chests and keys separate for just 1 IP each, or get them together for 100 IP each, I'd recommend the first suggestion. Now continue buying these until you get 3 champ shards. Combine them to get back a champ and use him/her/it to test and play. That's the only way to get champs right now, I got about 8 or 9 right now. It may take about 30+ chests and keys to get the champs though, its not easy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-01-14T17:32:45.974+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They had reset them so people could test the crafting system for unlocking, I believe.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saiyu","date":"2016-01-14T17:40:14.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah~ That makes sense!
