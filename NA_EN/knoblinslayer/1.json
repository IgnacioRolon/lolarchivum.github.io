Guess it depends on if you need more damage with the R or if you can afford to throw out a couple AA's. Gunblade might even be a viable option at that point too though given her high AD and AP ratios.

E goes threw Wind Wall and you get get creative with the Q poke by bouncing it around walls of minions if your good.  As far as team fighting against him tho its as simple as not Ulting until he walls lol. I know that sounds so basic but you have enough threat with Ult and Q that he will have to wall eventually, and when he does its hunting season after that.\n\nGlad to see sombody else playing it to, i think its kind of a hidden gem\n\nEddit:\nSorry I didnt touch on her 47 ad LV 1\nI agree thats rough expecially for CS but her overall laning i think is her strongest feature. Her ability to bully people out of lane is soooo underated. Its not easy to because it consist of a a lot of getting the right angels and bouncing your Q off minions for make range poke.
