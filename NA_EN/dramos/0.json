Goal there would be to offer more build flexibility (old Athene&rsquo;s, by contrast, was too heavily overlapped with Morello&rsquo;s, with one of the two items always dominating the other for most champions). \n\nSource: [State of the Season: Mid-season followup](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/state-season-mid-season-followup)\n\nYou may remember these words, Meddler (or whoever wrote this article; there&#039;s a small &quot;BY MEDDLER&quot; under the title).\n\nAnd since the mages still buy a certain item ( {{item:3165}} ) more for it&#039;s Cooldown Reduction than for it&#039;s effect, I wonder when we hear about this &quot;flexible&quot; new item. Or **if** we hear about it - it&#039;s possible that you dismissed the plan of a second AP+20% CDR item.\n\nJust a question of clarification. And curiosity. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-09-12T23:19:05.034+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'd still like to do one at some point, other item work's higher priority at present however (some changes to AD assassin items, Locket changes and possible replacement items, Rylai's changes etc).

It's a great item, but buying a tear then going for a CDR item (like Morellonomicon) puts you behind. Going full-on into Archangel means you get the full power of the item sooner, but you're likely still behind your opposing laner in terms of CDR (whether they're AD or AP) and you'll likely lose trades because you're still stuck with one spell rotation per fight/engagement.\n\nWith all the mana/mana regen changes that happened a while back, it's amazing that Archangel/Seraph's is still such a \"bad\" choice on a lot of mages. You can't take advantage of an item's mid-to-late game power spike if you inherently put yourself behind by investing in that item.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Stargazer","date":"2016-09-13T19:43:44.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was wondering what keeps you from turning Rylai's into a CDR item? CDR is always useful (and rather OP) but in cases where items work too well (hint: Morello+Rylais on every mage=easy win) it could work as a balancing lever. If it was for Rylai's to ditch its 400 HP in favour of 20% CDR, it would force the mages into very specific decisions. Do I need GW? Morello. Do I need to kite someone? Rylai's. Do I need them both? I cap out on CDR and skip on Zhonya's/Abyssal/Ionian/Lich Bane. Do you have any insight you can give on this?","replies":[]},{"poster":"BloodyTompon","date":"2016-09-13T03:01:53.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting. I felt like the direction Riot was aiming for was a guaranteed cap of CDR with a relatively high degree of time agnosticism to help with game pacing and scaling. Much easier to balance around a world were everybody not only has access to max CDR, but is likely to achieve that too because it doesn't take into account current builds to the same degree. \n\nMay I ask were _do_ you see CDR's place in the game if the above is not correct?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Crett","date":"2016-09-12T14:01:32.652+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, if you're {{champion:17}} there's always {{item:3115}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pyro","date":"2016-09-12T12:23:31.528+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a tough nut to crack.\n\nMorellonomnomnomicon provides every offensive stat a mage needs, save for magic penetration. Any item competing with it would step outside the needs of the Mage class and into the territory of Supports or Tanks. The item is still a huge stat stick with a gimmicky passive to balance things out.\n\nHere's the deal. If you make an alternative AP 20% CDR item, and it doesn't have mana, it will be probably too strong on manaless AP champions. If it does have mana, it will overlap with Morellonomicon in all the stats it provides. We already have pairs of items that provide the exact same stats and the effect is more often than not one item being overshadowed by the other (see: RoA and Frostcannon).\n\nAsk yourself another question: In what situation would you like to have an alternative option? In lane, or in lategame builds?","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoronMuncherV","date":"2016-09-12T12:16:51.222+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rip mid lane {{item:3174}} :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2016-09-13T20:05:54.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can't we just tack on an extra 10% on Lich bane and call it a day?","replies":[]},{"poster":"UnbornHeretic","date":"2016-09-13T03:31:41.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You used to be able to build the component parts for the cd reduction and then like finish your archangels or build a zhonyas or whatever.
