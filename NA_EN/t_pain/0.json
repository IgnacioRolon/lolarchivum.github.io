I used to sit at 35-40.  I know for a fact that my internet is working fine and I do not have any issue with other games.  I have cycled my router and modem a handful of times, turned off my firewall to see if that was an issue, but nothing has worked.  It happened all of the sudden and it is making the game unplayable.  I will be auto attacking and then it will skip a full auto attack animation. I have tried repairing my client and that did not fix anything either.  \n\nIf you can give me any insight on what the issue may be I would greatly appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-16T23:09:02.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even though your internet works fine elsewhere, you can still have issues reaching specific servers like our game servers.  It sounds like you could have an unstable network when reaching our game server, which can result in these delays.  You've done some solid steps so far, but I suggest going over each instruction of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help rule out possibilities.  Test it out in a custom game, and let me know if it helps!","replies":[{"poster":"T Pain","date":"2017-03-20T20:54:34.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I submitted a ticket  and they ran me through all of the possibilities and they believe there is a problem with my ISP. Kind of strange as it happened out of nowhere. I have been in contact with my ISP and submitted a ticket. Just waiting on a response now.\n\nThank you!","replies":[]}]}]}
