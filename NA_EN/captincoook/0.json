This means the issue is likely tied to the configuration file saved server-side trying to pull an old resolution and causing the crash. I recommend completing a reset of your input file with the steps below to resolve this.\n\nFirst, you'll want to **log into the game** then navigate to your config folder, which should be in your install directory:\n\n>**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config**\n\nDelete these following files:\n**- input.ini\n- PersistedSettings.json**\n\nOnce you've deleted these two files, hop into a custom match to see if the reset worked! Let me know if this fixed the crashes you were experiencing. ^.^","replies":[]}]}
