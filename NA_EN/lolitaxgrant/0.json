Also, Riot doesn't do pure VUs anymore. The only way that can happen is with a full VGU, either on a Sion or Ezreal scale. What about all the other champs that desparately need updates like Fiddle? Riot should just keep them under the tire to update the already popular champs with their constant new skins?\n\n>Just polishing the game would be nice as a goal for 2019. I was hoping 2019 would be the focus for that, but alas we still have pizza feet champs, and mordekaiser still looks like a trash can.\n\nVGU one could argue are a way of polishing the game, and Riot still is working on updating champs, such as Mord currently. Outside of that, with how the community has been reacting to Riot's balance decisions for quite some time now, do you really think that was going to be a goal that everyone could agree was going to happen?","replies":[{"poster":"kayochan","date":"2019-02-28T16:42:11.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Old as in old champs, not much to it. They're outdated and need to be upgraded with the current aesthetic of the game..Im ignoring their kits for now, that can be changed with time, but im saying plain model updates. (which they somewhat did with the slightest of changes, and colors, and getting rid of the bulkiness in champs)  I know Rito wouldn't bother unless its a huge overhaul. I was just answering the question. \n\nNo saying outdated doesn't mean bad. A lot of things are outdated but its not bad...hence why they're still there. Im just saying Ahri and Lux as examples, not \"go work on the right away\" I was saying in terms of even popular champs need a little love. Just to overall fit in with leagues new style, you can easily tell the new from the old. it would be nice to see all champs polished simply put. \n\nI know Rito is working on champs, i know theyre **trying** their best. Im just saying its 2019 and instead of releasing all these new champs they should focus on cleaning up this mess of a game in all aspects. But like I said, I was just answering the question. Don't really wanna bag on Riot more than I already do lol.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BLIGHTBRINGER","date":"2019-02-28T07:03:19.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"VU {{champion:110}} (but seeing as to how he is problematic, he might need a VGU at this point)","replies":[]},{"poster":"micachu","date":"2019-02-28T06:35:56.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:117}} Compared to the other female yordles, she (especially her default skin) looks like a small, chewed up blob of bubblegum.
