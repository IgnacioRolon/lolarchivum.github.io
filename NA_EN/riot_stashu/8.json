Off the bat, we&rsquo;ve heard you and we strongly agree that his sustain is what sets him apart both strategically and thematically, and we&rsquo;re looking to keep it that way. With that out of the way, let&rsquo;s get a little more specific:\r\n\r\nWe&rsquo;re not likely to change:\r\n\r\n* Sustain -- Vladimir is the best sustainer in his class and likely the best in the game (Mundo might take that one).\r\n* Health costs -- Risk management in the form of his own HP bar has always been core to Vladimir, and we&rsquo;d like to reinforce that.\r\n* Stat Affinity -- Vlad has always been the AP + HP guy, and we think that&rsquo;s pretty cool.\r\n* Q Targeting -- Not everything has to be a skill shot, and we think retaining the old paradigm here is important to the spell&rsquo;s feel.\r\n* Strengths / Weaknesses -- Vlad is the Mage who can out sustain low-damage foes but falls to teams with reliable gap-closing and burst damage.\r\n* Sanguine Pool -- An iconic ability that should be preserved.\r\n\r\nWe&rsquo;re looking to improve:\r\n\r\n* Stack management -- We like the cerebral health cost management aspects of E, but we do not like the resulting unintuitive upkeep game.\r\n* Binary matchups -- Vlad is sometimes thought of as the king of stat checks, leaving his opponents (and often himself) with few options other than &lsquo;be stronger,&rsquo; and that&rsquo;s not a reputation anyone wants. A lot of this comes from unclear windows of strength and weakness (they exist, but are difficult to perceive), so a lot of our work will be in exposing those.\r\n* Counterplay -- Closely related to the above point, Vladimir&rsquo;s opponents often feel there&rsquo;s nothing they can do to avoid his damage once in range of him. \r\n* Satisfaction -- Mostly looking at E here (&lsquo;Tides of Blood&rsquo; inspires a much more powerful image than the current E delivers on, and we&rsquo;d like to change that), though there&rsquo;s a few other areas that can feel better. TLDR; Needs blood. MORE BLOOD.\r\n\r\nWhen we&rsquo;re done:\r\n\r\n* Vladimir&rsquo;s kit should feel very familiar, and his overall strategy will be largely unchanged!\r\n* Vladimir&rsquo;s windows of strength and weakness will be clearer to both himself and the opponent, giving everyone an increased understanding of how he succeeds or fails and allowing him to plan and set up plays.\r\n* Vladimir will continue to deal loads of DPS and heal buckets of HP, but in more satisfying and less diffuse ways.\r\n\r\nAnddd that about sums it up! I know I&rsquo;ve been pretty abstract here, so please ask any question you may have -- we&rsquo;re not through with all the nitty gritty details on our end yet, so I may not have all the answers you&rsquo;re looking for, but I can definitely share our thoughts and the relevant guiding principles. Also, and most importantly, if any of the above breaks your expectations of what Vladimir is or should be, now&rsquo;s definitely the time to let us know!\r\n\r\nAlright, that&rsquo;s it from me for now but I&rsquo;ll be around over the next couple days!

I love that Vlad is 'the spellvamp guy.' It's very thematic and is pretty unique to him. But...\n\nIt's tough to make a damaging ability with a health cost when spell vamp exists, as the healthcost quickly fades to irrelevance (especially AoE spells in minion waves!) That said, we do not *want* to remove spellvamp, and we want Vlad's spells to do damage and cost health, so we're going to have to find some clever solutions here. \n\nCurrently, for example, we're exploring reducing vamp's effectiveness on minions, but this is just one of the many stabs we're taking at trying to get these things to coexist.","replies":[{"poster":"SuperLuigiLXIV","date":"2016-03-05T00:59:23.530+0000","up_votes":124,"down_votes":3,"body":"Well, the release of Jhin certainly proved you guys are completely capable of and willing to make exceptions using insane math equations. That alone opened up windows for options :D\n\nWhat if you added a condition to Vlad's passive that spellvamp on his kit instead fills a secondary resource bar, similar to Aatrox? And his spells that cost health would instead draw from this \"pool\" before his own health, because he's using his enemy's blood to fuel his power instead of sacrificing his own?\n\nSpellvamp suddenly becomes much less of a sustain resource on Vlad. Sure, maybe if he gets ahead, he can cut down on the health costs of his spells, but that's nothing special. A snowballing Aatrox or Mundo do the exact same thing. And if the pool itself provides no defensive value, no \"second health pool\" to block damage with, then spellvamp becomes _offensive_ sustain only, with no _defensive_ benefits to speak of.\n\nThe value here becomes twofold:\n\n-You don't have to balance spellvamp around the one problem case that uses it (I wish you guys would make Iceborne Gauntlet melee only so you don't have to balance THAT around the problem case of Ezreal)\n\n-You can much more easily balance Vlad's sustain vs cost numbers, as you directly control precisely how much sustain he has independent of every other mage.","replies":[{"poster":"Kitsune Fatale","date":"2016-03-07T00:13:32.869+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":2,"body":"Can't up-vote this enough, I feel like this is a great idea, it also gives him a feasible direction as to how to build. However, I think the premise of buying Spell Vamp as a whole is a fairly defensive idea, the problem with it is the amount that Vladimir abuses it, so what if they simply reduced the effectiveness of Spell Vamp as a whole on Vladimir, say a 60% reduction, so that it still gives him some sustain, otherwise champions that already kick his ass early game *cough* {{champion:92}}  *cough* won't dominate him due to the lack of his ability to sustain the high damage trades.\n\nYou could then use a secondary resource bar that is filled with the blood he takes from enemy champs (remember that 60% reduction? Have it fill this) and use that to amp his spells in different ways. It'd be similar to a Renekton rage bar mechanic, where the higher it is, the less prone you should be to trying to fight him without buying him dinner first. You could balance it by filling this only with the Spell Vamp from champs, that way he doesn't just Q a minion and then proceed to murder you under your tower.\n\nI love the idea that he uses his opponents blood to feed his spells. I think that it would be a fantastically unique mechanic for a very unique champion and it'd make it so Vladimir actually is out-playable instead of just \"stay the hell out of his range or burst him\".\n\nTL;DR you deserve more upvotes sir. {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nameless Voice","date":"2016-03-04T23:26:33.272+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spell vamp in general, or just for Vlad?\n\nIt's already a lot harder for mages to get spell vamp and heal themselves up than it is for AD champions to grab lifesteal.","replies":[{"poster":"Guiotine","date":"2016-03-04T23:33:24.833+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nameless Voice,realm=EUW,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=OJQBsbEM,comment-id=000a00000000,timestamp=2016-03-04T23:26:33.272+0000)\n>\n> Spell vamp in general, or just for Vlad?\n> \n> It's already a lot harder for mages to get spell vamp and heal themselves up than it is for AD champions to grab lifesteal.\n\nThis has been the big question for me since I first heard about these reworks.

The only counterplay to it is to not be within range.\n\nThat spell is one of the main reasons why Vlad can become a bit of a lane bully against some melee match-ups.\n\nAlso sustain have a tendency to become very uninteresting, as it works very well against minions, and with no other resources, like mana he simply pushes you out of lane. At a certain point sustain get to the point of, if you don't kill the guy in an all-in, you might as well not attack him, creating a very non-interactive situation, where both just ignore each other and attack minions instead.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Stashu","date":"2016-03-04T23:12:03.303+0000","up_votes":87,"down_votes":10,"body":"\"Free sustain+Damage+Point & Click is not really a good combination of things.

If you get damage through buying tankiness, things can snowball out of hand very quickly as you improve both your defense AND your threat against your opponent while they only get to improve one of these. \n\nThe trick is to build in some limiters. Looking at Vlad again, HP gives him tankiness inherently and damage through his passive and W scaling, but the %HP cost on his W makes this less abusive, since a lot of that tankiness goes out the window via his own kit.

I hope the update doesn't change this as my primary sustenance as a Vlad main is blood AND assassin tears.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Stashu","date":"2016-03-04T23:34:24.518+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey! About that assassin point, I believe his W is his main advantage there. Are there other aspects of the kit you find critical in his assassin matchups?","replies":[{"poster":"Blood Magicks","date":"2016-03-04T23:52:08.678+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey, thanks for replying! You are correct that his pool is is primary anti-assassin tool, because if timed right it can help dodge many combos and the particularly obnoxious Zed ultimate (also the heal on it helps at times, if you move under a minion wave while pooling).\nThere are also a few additional aspects of his kit  - e.g. he's already somewhat tanky when most assassins start cheesing (I manage to back for a cheap defensive item before the BIG ASSASSIN ULT CHEESE and it usually saves me). The stat conversion helps greatly in justifying starting with a defensive item (eg Spectre's against a LeBlanc).\nAnother main point is that if Vlad survives an assassin combo, he can then regenerate most of his missing health while the enemy still has their cooldowns up. But I doubt you will change any of this.\nWhat mildly worried me is that you mentioned adding counterplay to the healing on Q. Depending on how you balance it, this might make such counterplay easily within the reach of squishy mobile opponents or not so much. A large part of Vlad's ability to deal with assassins at present lies in his easy trades once he survives the burst and it goes without saying that the ability to easily negate the healing he gains will take that away.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Stashu","date":"2016-03-05T00:02:47.889+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"Gotcha! Thanks for the breakdown. I'll try to keep a close eye on his assassin matchups in development, but I hope this eases your mind: we plan on keeping W pretty much identical, maintaining his best-in-class lane sustain, and encouraging high HP builds [for a mage].","replies":[{"poster":"Rain Silencia","date":"2016-03-05T00:05:55.156+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont think Assassins are really as big of a problem as Vlad than powerful close range mages like LB, Ryze and Cassiopeia, against those you pretty much cant do anything but just stay outside their range.","replies":[{"poster":"Blood Magicks","date":"2016-03-05T00:32:42.297+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"I wasn't saying assassins are a problem for Vlad, just that he's my go-to pick when I see an assassin mid on the enemy team.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rain Silencia","date":"2016-03-04T23:57:26.957+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"His large innate health really helps preventing to be bursted down, due to him being a 0 mana caster he is also capable of obtaining defensive itemization quickly, combined with his pool those would be the main reasons.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nimble Manta","date":"2016-03-04T23:59:02.991+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just wanna stop by and say thanks.
