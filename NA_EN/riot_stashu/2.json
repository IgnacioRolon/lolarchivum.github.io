Today I’d like to go into some detail about our upcoming Cassiopeia changes. Real quick though, I’d like to add that I’ve been surprised to see all of the attention Cassiopeia has been getting on Boards-- I’m really happy to see that so many players care about our favorite Snake Lady, even though things got a bit... passionate. Your enthusiasm is definitely noted.\r\n\r\nAlso, sorry if I haven't been as involved as I should have been in directing the conversation. At the end of the day, I had to take a step back to examine all of your feedback as I distill it into something actionable. Truthfully, it felt like many of the discussions would spiral into the same 10 paper kits or unconstructive comments on repeat, which wasn’t particularly useful. I’d like to get into deeper debates about why a proposed spell will or will not work, but those can be pretty tough because they usually don't just stop at just one reply. That said, I’ve been reading virtually everything, and there has been a wealth of insightful and helpful feedback aside from these, even since the beginning.\r\n\r\nSo, let’s get into it. Here are a few of the major pain points that many people seem to share:\r\n\r\n* **Cassiopeia is no longer a poison mage**\r\n * While this sentiment is a bit harsh, I totally agree that we’ve lost some of what made Cassiopeia so cool to many of her biggest fans. This is my biggest regret from the update, and we’re looking to get this back.\r\n* **Aspect of the Serpent is chore-ish**\r\n * This was not the intent. The most chore-like part (minion farming) has too much focus for what was intended as a fall-back, so we’ll be addressing that as well.\r\n* **I miss the long range, AoE, DoT pattern**\r\n * In actual fact, DoT’s do a lot more damage than anyone realizes, and often times so do AoE’s, so in order for Cassiopeia to be balanced as a long-range AoE DoT dealer, she’d have to take some significant hits. We had to make a choice here, and we went with giving her the most potent DoTs on single targets. Cass can still apply DoT from long range, but accessing her full power requires commitment to a single target (with E). This way we can give Cass meaningful DoT power on single targets instead of weak DoTs to all enemies. Fishing from long range with Qs and Ws is an important and fun part of her play pattern that we want to keep.\r\n\r\nSo with all that in mind, let’s take a look at a proposed changelist (which should be hitting PBE soon):\r\n\r\n* **Aspect of the Serpent**\r\n * No longer stacks on poisoned unit kill or on Twin Fang casts on enemy champions.\r\n * Now, stacks once every 6 seconds (10 times per minute) and for every second that an enemy champion is poisoned.\r\n * Breakpoints adjusted to keep them at approximately the same game time, but this is still up in the air (i.e. maybe they should come sooner).\r\n* **Noxious Blast**\r\n * As it turns out, this ability uses old tech and has always been inconsistent in delay, hitting anywhere between ~0.25s and ~0.5s after casting. This means that the ‘change’ to a 0.3s delay didn’t actually do anything >.> We’ll be fixing this is the same way that we’ve fixed abilities like Rupture and Dark Matter in the past, so now it will consistently hit at the same time. We’re starting with a 0.35s delay time, which should ultimately result in a much more reliable ability (this is a buff), but will see if we need to change this.\r\n* **Miasma**\r\n * No change.\r\n* **Twin Fang**\r\n * No longer restores mana on unit kill (mana costs reduced accordingly). Some people really enjoyed this, so I’d consider adding it back, but with the minion farming mini game gone, this seemed less fitting on the kit.\r\n * Now adds a debuff on the target which significantly amplifies further poison damage. We have less confidence in this change, but it’s potentially super cool and solves some problems, so I can’t wait to see how it tests. Also, this is strictly a buff.\r\n * As a note, this is not possible yet, but we're looking into some better buffering tech on spellcasts so that spamming the E button as it's coming off CD is more responsive.\r\n * Also, how does everyone feel about the current CD? 0.5 s might just be a little low, as it keeps Cassiopeia locked in place, casting E's and hardly being able to move. I'd love to hear what people would think about skimming off some power here (say, bringing it to a 0.75s CD or something) and loading it into the DoT amp aspect, or something else. Thanks!\r\n* **Petrifying Gaze**\r\n * No change.\r\n\r\nAnd there you have it! Please let me know if there are non-power related kit concerns that you feel are unaddressed, new problems created, or things you miss about old Cassio that these changes don’t bring back.\r\n\r\nBy the way, in these discussions, it can be really hard to get through proposed solutions that are focused on number analysis or are of the form \"here's what the ability should do!\" They get focused on what's difficult to solve or what might create more problems, rather than being focused on honing in on the original problem -- the real purpose of the discussions in the first place. Personally, I find the most valuable responses to vaguely fit some form like “I don’t feel that [change] solves [problem] for[reasoning],” or “These changes don’t address [problem], which I believe is concerning because [reasoning].” This lets both of us discuss possible solutions and hash out potential problems rather than arguing about the validity of suggestions :)\r\n\r\nLastly, as, a disclaimer, none of the above is certain, and everything is still in testing. But you can expect to see most of this or some form of it hit PBE pretty soon (probably early next week)!\r\n\r\nAlright, that’s about it. I look forward to hearing what everybody has to say :D","replies":[{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2014-11-01T03:08:41.098+0000","up_votes":84,"down_votes":6,"body":"Okay, I'll try my hand at this:\n\nI don't believe the changes to Cass's passive fixes the core issue here. Currently her passive provides no gameplay; just a ball of stats at certain points in the game. Wasn't that the reason why Irelia can't be viable? She's just a ball of stats, no gameplay?\n\nAlso, I don't understand how her passive ties into her theme of poisoning enemies. Cass (in my eyes at least) has always been a siege/zone control mage with a large amount of damage over time. If you didn't engage on her, she'd whittle you down to the point where you can't engage safely.\n\n\nNext:\n\nI appreciate the change/fix to her Q. I certainly do hope that it feels more reliable. However, I still dislike how it is lacking as cass's primary form of dmg. I honestly feel that by backloading her dmg into her passive is really hindering cass from scaling well with items. her early game is too weak because of this, and all the champs that used to give me a headache are still gonna obliterate me now that I can't harass them since my Q does not provide a real threat.\n\nSame goes for Cass's W. Before her rework, her W was a great zoning tool. It wasn't crazy strong, but it did enough dmg to act as a deterent to those that would stand in it. Now, it barely does more dmg than their innate healing. The slow isn't strong enough to be a threat in and of itself like singed's adhesive. And with it's dmg output so low, the enemy is more than willing to sit in it when trying to cs knowing that they can harass me if I try to spam E on them.\n\n\nNext:\n\nOkay, big one here. It's clear you are trying here. I'll give you that. However, there are still some glaring problems with your proposition. First and foremost, Twin Fang still occupies too much of Cass's power budget. It really feels like you are putting all of Cass's eggs into one basket with this spell, leaving her with precious few fallback patterns. If you are really dead set on this, then you need to make cass's E dmg more accessable. You already mentioned an issue with cass being unable to kite/chase enemies due to being locked in place while firing her E. So why not incorporate a super mini-slow like talon's hamstring(cut throat) or allow her to move while casting?\n\nRight now, I don't understand how adding a debuff to cass's E for her poison dmg is gonna help Cass be who she used to be. She is still too short ranged. She is still spending too much time on one target (instead of switching targets when needed) She is still too weak to zone the enemy, and outside of her ult, she lacks any way of dealing with champs that jump on her (zed, akali, fizz, leblanc, talon, kha'zix, etc) Basically, if cass can't obliterate champs within the 2 secs they are stunned by her ult, she dies. There is too much cc + burst + gap closers in this game for her to chunk ppl down like adc's do.\n\n\nHere is the biggest problem I see with your current design trend. You want cass to be like an adc. But you aren't giving her the right tools to do what an adc does. \n\nFirst:\nIf an adc is chunked to half hp, they can heal up on a minion wave or jungle camp. If cass is chunked to half hp, she has no other recourse but to back and heal.\n\nSecond:\nAn adc generally has a form of self peel or a reliable escape, only a few are an exception from this(MF, ashe, varus) However, due to the aforementioned lack of sustain, and cass's dependence on building pure dmg to get the most of her passive (and terrible ratios) is left extremely vulnerable to any form of hard engage. Most midlaners and counter this buy building defensive items due to good ratio's and fall back play patterns.\n\n--**TO BE CONTINUED**","replies":[{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2014-11-01T03:19:31.729+0000","up_votes":66,"down_votes":5,"body":"--**CONTINUATION**\n\nThird:\nAlmost all adc's have more range than Cass's E. It doesn't matter if Cass's E is listed at 550 or even 600 units. This is because spells calculate distance from center to center while adc aa's calcuate distance from edge to edge(blast it I can't remember the word for it, but you know what I mean) This effectively reduces her attack range to that of a 450 aa champ. No adc in the history of has been or ever will be viable with an aa range of 450. It is just far too short, putting them far too close to the enemy, leaving them completely exposed.\n\nAnd Finally:\nThe main crux of why Cass, as she is, cannot function as a mage adc is becase she cannot switch targets as effectively as an adc. In a team fight, champs are moving all over the place. An adc can shoot one target then quickly change to another if they need to reposition or if another enemy is within range that is of higher priority. But cass can't do this. She is limited to target's she's poisoned. This means that if she needs to change targets, she needs to spray them with poison, but if she just used her poison, or if her poison just wore off and she accidentally casts her E on them, she is a sitting duck. With no reposition tools to take advantage of, she is left twiddling her thumbs till her q and e both come off cd. And in that time span of 3 seconds or so, she can go from full hp to dead. At least adc's don't have to worry about lame duck periods. They can continue to aa whenever they please.\n\nThis also feeds into my reason why I don't think the current E changes do anything to help. Now, not only can she chunk ppl with her E (as it will most likely lose dmg to allow the debuff to be meaningful) she is even more relient on focusing a single target down, and if she can't kill them in that 2 second time span, she's effectively screwed.\n\n\n\nSo yeah, tl;dr - I know yer really trying, but I still feel that a lot of her old problems haven't been fixed, and these new changes feel more like bandaid's fixes to a more comprehensive problem.\n\n\n\n\nPS: I really friggin hate the stupid character limit you guys have on these posts. it almost ruined my train of thought, and that is absolutely terrible if you intend on having meaningful discussions on these forums.\n\n\nPPS: I know you say you try to read all comments, but I really hope you do. I regret coming in to this thread so late, as I'm afraid my post(s) will get drowned out due to how the upvote system works. So yeah, I really hope you do manage to find/read this encyclopedia of a post I wrote.\n\n\nPPPS: Wow, honestly was not expecting this many upvotes and visibility on my post. I thank you guys so much, I don't think I've ever had a post at the top of a big thread like this before.

Thanks for the super thoughtful response, I think it was well articulated and brings up many common concerns. I'll speak to a few of them.\n\nBall of stats- \n\n*  As a starting point, imagine a passive that just gave 25% CDR. This is pure stats, much like Cassiopeia's second breakpoint. This does interesting things, like say 'this character can only improve his CDR by 15% more,' which may be appropriate but is really just lame, and much of the passive could have been accomplished by simply lowering the champion's base CD's by 25%... On the other hand, the purpose to Cassiopeia's breakpoint 2 is not to just give her lower cooldowns, but for her to *evolve* at a certain point in the game, which changes based on both her and her opponents performance. A large factor in the goal set here is to create a feeling of evolution, or acendence over the course of the game. This is something that Nasus's passive, for example, does not do, even though it scales with levels. If we have not hit this feeling (which I don't think we have, fully anyway, we could really use some audio or something to push it), then we should continue to try to improve on it. Think of it sort of like KhaZix evolution passive. He faces more direct tradeoff/decisions with his, but he also just gets them by leveling (whereas Cassiopeia realistically needs to hit a lot of Qs). The passive does have some weird stuff to it, but there's a brain dump on why I think it adds a lot to the character.\n\nQ/W damage -\n\n* With this update, Q will be back on par with the damage it used to do and can even go higher, provided you hit the target with some E's first. I know this is not necessarily a satisfactory answer to those who reallllly just loved the sit-back-and-poke pattern, but at the end of the day, we wanted to push Cassiopeia's unique combat pattern, which means she'll depend a little more on getting in E range, instead of just poking around like Ziggs, say. W damage is definitely quite low, I'll be tracking that as we move forward, but it seems appropriate on a spell with that dodgeability profile (0 dodgeability =/ ).\n\nADC stuff-\n\n* Yeah the biggest pushback in comparing Cassiopeia to an ADC is that their attack frames scale down with game length because of attack speed, whereas Cassiopeia's E cast time is simply static (and comparatively long). That said, Cassiopeia has access to a potent slow in the form of Rylais (let's be real, frozen mallet is not a viable buy on ADCs), and also has Zhonyas as an optional buy which is a defensive option ADCs simply don't have access to, so she can get around these problems to some degree. You raise some counterpoints to the itemization argument, like how she depends on high AP for her passive and such, but I don't think it's as binary as it appears. Also, her passive givers her sustain, though not quite as much as a healthy amount of lifesteal for ADCs. Lastly, about self peel, Miamsa and her Ultimate are pretty good self peel tools, they are no buster shot, but they outclass a lot of ADC options. Basically, though similar, there are a lot of factors that make it difficult to compare her to an ADC. Bottom line is: does her Q/W fight into E kite pattern work, or is it just a trap to stand there and E spam? Valid questions, not sure where she actually falls there. When I play her, I feel like I can kite / E effectively, though some people disagree. I think increasing the CD on E would go a long way here.\n\nSo those are just some thoughts. Mostly just meaning to be conversational here, just explain my thinking on these points. Let me know if anything doesn't makes sense, thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Cuix","date":"2014-11-02T05:24:04.254+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":2,"body":"> A large factor in the goal set here is to create a feeling of evolution, or acendence over the course of the game.

This sort of play pattern, with machine gun spell usage and a single large particle appearing repeatedly, does not match the calculated and manipulative characterization of Cassi from her lore. While her toxins will become more important technically, the actual playstyle and use cases will be unchanged, despite those being widely disliked.\n\n> That said, Cassiopeia has access to a potent slow in the form of Rylais (let's be real, frozen mallet is not a viable buy on ADCs), and also has Zhonyas as an optional buy which is a defensive option ADCs simply don't have access to, so she can get around these problems to some degree.

The health is insufficient, as she's squishy regardless, and the AP doesn't scale as well as many of her other necessary items. The high cost of the item means that it delays her build significantly, which is particularly unpleasant considering the delayed activation of her kit due to her passive. Zhonya's is a good option for her, but leaves her stranded, and most teams below Gold or Plat will have trouble taking care of an ADC and a Cassi throughout a teamfight. This is somewhat acceptable in terms of creating champions with niche strengths, but in practice leaves her fairly unplayable for too many people. As for her sustain and self-peel, these are quite clearly below similar power that exists in the kits of current high priority picks (possible exceptions of Jinx and Twitch, who outrange her anyway). On top of that, her Miasma will likely not be available for peeling/CC due to its necessity as a poison application tool, and even when available its effect is underwhelming.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-11-02T05:37:39.208+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"A) At the end of the day, her passive is still 'This champion has more stats.'\n\nC) Slows don't help much against the league of mobility she has to deal with. Zhonya's is a powerful defensive tool, but it's bad on Cass. Cass has to be constantly casting spells to do her damage, especially nowadays. Compare that to, say, a Fizz, or basically any other mage except for Ryze, who can afford to take a couple of seconds to get the heat off of them. Cass missing those few seconds is several Es that she could have cast, drastically lowering her damage output. Also, again, slows don't help against the League of Mobility, and her ult is fairly easily reacted too, compared to, say, an Ashe arrow or, god forbid, any dash.\n\nPlus, there's still a problem that every team comp is forced to have a fragile, sustained damage dealer as an ADC, because very few ADCs have appreciable burst. Why would you want to double up on that?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2014-11-01T02:12:49.924+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":1,"body":"While you're at it, can you make Cassiopeia's passive stack up faster in Dominion?

If so this doesn't solve a thing. It was never a chore from how you gained stacks, it was a chore from the very fact that you *had* to gain stack (it is neither fun nor engaging hence why it's a chore), specifically because of how painfully slow it took to get the stacks. No one likes being useless for 40 minutes of the game which is the whole issue. I think you took the term 'farming passive' a little too literally when people were using that term to complain about the passive.\n\nI think a mana return on her E should remain. The extra mana was random and unnecessary imo but mana return on kill will encourage using it for last hitting which is what you want E to be, an autoattack.\n\nWith the poison debuff I don't feel like that really solves the issue as what people liked WAS the combination of AoE and DoT. You're (possibly) only giving us back the DoT, the AoE remains gone.\n\nCan't really comment on the CD change since I haven't experienced not being able to move around since I don't actually play Cassiopeia anymore (2nd champion you guys have killed for me after Karma), and yes I did give her a chance. Before this rework happened I championed the E bugfix of the poison check happening on cast with the CD increasing to 0.7 to account for the projectile travel time so perhaps this proposal wouldn't be an issue although technically it is a nerf to her damage.\n\nOverall these changes don't feel like they solve anything really. The look a little haphazard in an attempt to please some peoples wants and compalints while not addressing Cassiopeia's very real problems. Her rework direction is exceptionally flawed and making tweaks while clinging onto the core of the rework will never fix her.","replies":[{"poster":"Battlecast Sona","date":"2014-11-01T09:10:21.505+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":35,"body":"1) Karma is amazing now.

Her lategame scaling is INSANE now (1100 AP easily with max stacks on passive) and her damage is huge, still. The net buffs will make her laning better (maxing Q will be viable again with E to amp the damage, opening up paths for Cassi that is behind to max Q for waveclear and farming purposes). She now gains stacks passively, with additional stacks granted for poisoning your enemy (which you should be doing anyway).\n\nFor reference, on the current system I am generally max stacks by 30 minutes unless I've had an awful game. That's pretty good considering the HUGE benefits her stacks give you.\n\nI mean, let's look at what they actually DID give her with the rework:\n\nShe now has the ability to scale very hard into lategame (something she kinda did before but it was more about abusing the low cooldown on her E rather than any actual scaling she had going for her).\n\nShe now has the ability to heal off her E without making any spellvamp (opening up her build path and choices).\n\nShe gets a ton of passive AP at 400 stacks, also opening up build options for more specialized builds based on what the enemy team is doing.\n\nShe also gets 25% CDR just for being Cassi.\n\nJust saying \"her rework direction is flawed\" is not an argument. Why is it flawed? Riot set themselves a goal (making Cassi weaker in the early game and stronger late) and accomplished it in spades. Yes, she needs some love to really feel like a \"poison\" mage instead of a \"twin fang\" mage, but the passive change is actually one of the few changes I thought was nice. It allows Cassiopeia players to get stronger based on their ability to land poisons in lane, which is pretty awesome. It also gives Cassi a place with the likes of Nasus. So maybe you don't like the \"chore\" of maxing her stacks, but you can't deny that they give Cassi things she desperately needed before. It was difficult to find places to put CDR in her build but she scales well with it? Now she gets it passively. Cassi had a hard time scaling into late game due to the necessity of building tanky/utility items to survive fights? She gets a free dcap just for playing the game.\n\nYou just want your old Cassi back, the one that could 2v1 against the jungler and mid at level 6 without breaking a sweat, but that's precisely what Riot has been trying to get rid of.

Tons of AP looks good on paper but is meaningless if your ratios are trash. There is no difference between 500AP @1.0 ratio and 1000AP @ 0.5 ratio.\n\nFree CDR is a massive design sin in my eyes. If the champ needs lower cooldowns then just give them lower cooldowns. Free CDR is awkward and utterly guts your ability to build them, so many items you can no longer even consider on Cass these days because they have CDR. So yeah i'd really disagree with you on how 'open' her build paths are these days. I used to enjoy choosing between a more pure AP nukey Seraph/RoA/Rabadon build or a more DoT focused Athene/laindri/Rylai based on what I felt like each match. I don't get that choice anymore (and I better hope i'm not versing Mundo or Swain).\n\nAs to why I didn't elaborate on why her design is flawed? That would be because I, and many others have already repeated ourselves over the countless threads on this issue many times before. Riot should know why we feel the design is flawed by now so we're not going to keep repeating ourselves. Overall a lot of Riots goals for the rework would have been met with just base/ratio tweaks. She bullies in lane too hard? Boom early base damage nerfs. Want her to scale harder? Boom higher ratios. It's not hard.\n\nAs for Karma, purely in terms of power current Karma is significantly weaker because old Karma was objectively crazy overpowered. If you think otherwise then you never played her or tried to play her as 0cs support. Take her mid and give her farm and she was broken. I can only imagine what old Karma would have been like after all the Season 3 support changes to give them gold would've be like (or even been available on free week so more people could play, experiment and discover her). She had problems and needed W and passive work but not a relaunch. I'll never forget her but i'm not brooding over it. Also current Karma isn't very good, people can walk out of RQ before the second explosion, RW is a selfish heal completely out of place on a support and RE does too much. She also doesn't really have a theme anymore, she just kinda does magic things because reasons, unlike old Karma who had a *very* strong yin yang *Karma* thematic to her (every spell was offensive or defensive based on how you used it).","replies":[]},{"poster":"chumbler","date":"2014-11-01T09:17:45.894+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":8,"body":"> 1) Karma is amazing now.

They don't want a lane bully that falls off late game, they want a character that can actually be an AP CARRY instead of being some sort of weird AP hyper-anti-carry.\n\nAmount of AP doesn't matter when ratios are trash, and her late game *isn't even better than pre-rework*, it just takes way longer to get there (if you even do), is completely one-dimensional, and requires tedious busy work to get there. The direction is flawed because their ideas, implementation, and justification for it are so stupid and self-contradictory that it isn't even funny. It has been repeatedly explained to Riot what the problems are and they've ignored all of it and will no doubt continue to do so. You also bought hook line and sinker Riot's bullshit argument that she strangled the game beforehand. She was not overpowered or even close, had plenty of counters, and was a high risk pick deserving of high reward. The rework was done for literally no reason, and that they forced it through with no warning is proof. Stashu is in love with his idiotic stacking passive and wants to force it on somebody come hell or high water, so Morello just picked a champion designed by someone much better at his job than both of them to ruin with it.\n\nYou very obviously don't even have a clue what you're talking about if you think she scales well with cdr.\n\nCassiopeia gained *nothing* from this rework. What they claimed to want to turn her into is something she already was. This whole thing is unsalvageable garbage.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-11-01T02:07:48.733+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":2,"body":"I have no complaints about this on paper (then again, paper kits are difficult to figure out). My primary problems are A) your consideration that spamming E on one target counts as a DoT and B) that you still have the stacking passive.\n\nE is not a DoT. I have to press it every time I want it to do damage. Like, I get your basic thoughts, and I agree that AoE DoTs either feel terrible or feel overpowered so it might be better for her to be single target, but I feel that's a miscommunication problem that's been common with the rework (see also: How is Morde a DoT mage?)\n\nSecondly, I don't like the stacking passive for Cass. It makes sense from a gameplay standpoint, if you want to make her a late game hyper carry, but it doesn't make sense for her thematically, as a poison mage or as a character. Poison doesn't make you stronger, it makes your enemies weaker. 'Poisoning your enemies to buff yourself' was in the old kit, and it was kinda weird that landing your Q makes you move faster, but the rework massively increased that, by gating her entire late game behind poisoning people to make you stronger. As a character, it doesn't make much sense either. Cass is a sly manipulator, with lines like 'If you don't use pawns, you are one.' The whole 'unlocking my TRUE POWAH!' thing would make more sense for Syndra or Xerath.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Grand Eleven","date":"2014-11-01T22:43:19.105+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"OK I feel like picking apart each of her abilities bullet by bullet robs us of a more important discussion of \"feel\" and \"themes\".  So I apologize in advanced if I don't go bullet by bullet over your design changes (if that's what you want), as honestly I feel like that dodges the bigger topics that we need to address in this kit.\n\nGoing over your changes I see two themes:\n\n1. The passive, while being adjusted, is being largely kept as a mechanic going forward largely because it gives you more direct control of her power curve.\n2. The Poison theme is being blended back in by balancing _how_ E applies it's damage, not by distributing the power anywhere else.\n\nIf we look at both of these, it's apparent her current core model is basically viewed as \"complete\" and we are just trying to tweak the number details to match her theme better.\n\n***EDITED OUT***\nI put a philosophical design debate here but decided in hindsight it won't accomplish anything so I'm just going to accept we have to work with the passive instead of revert it.   The next paragraph won't flow quite as cleanly due to that but meh .. lets stay progressive.\n***EDITED OUT***\n\nThat said I doubt one post on her passive will sway you so I'll at least ask for smoother growth experience:  remove the power-spikes/breakpoints.   Give the stacks a smooth ratio.  If we are absolutely sold that you need to stranglehold the power curve then make it accessible constantly.   I get the impression that you're trying to emulate what an ADC does when he hits shop and returns with his first B.F. Sword then bloodthirster ... but if that's REALLY what you're trying to emulate you need to put more elbow grease into your item shop:  fixing it into your champion is and will always be awkward.\n\nAccepting I can't get you guys to do anything drastic like revamping the entire item pool ... so Ill accept the passive to a degree... but it feels like a bandaid so at least give us a smooth growth pattern.\n\nOnto \"Adding a debuff to \"E\" to increase further poison damage\" ... \n\nFirst off some positive:  thank you for at least trying to slip some poison back into her kit.\n\nOK that was hard to do ... onto the criticism:\n\nI think you're approaching this backwards.  by approaching the numbers the way you are you are basically saying \"all the damage will still be in E, we just make it feel like it's coming from Q or W.  It's a purely thematic moving around of numbers which I get, but I think we can push this to give Cass a bit more freedom as well as identity.  \n\nThe crux of this is that currently her \"poison spells\" have decent cooldowns and gateway her twin fang damage.   This means that while it's neat to call her a \"single damage hyper carry\" she lacks the ability to change targets so she's a handicapped single target damage dealer.  No other single target champion is locked down to said target for 3+ seconds.  If someone baits out the Q then falls back Cass can no longer do any damage to _Anyone_  until her next poison spell is up.  Akali pokes her head in range and I poison her .... then she leaves I can't turn my harass to ziggs .... he just gets free harass on me and my team because I have to wait for Q to come back.\n\nBasically I'm saying if twinfange is her ONLY damage ... then the gateway is too harsh.

I deeply appreciate your tone here, you express disappointment, but in a way which shows you really care about the character and are open to discussion-- thanks for that!\n\nTo your initial points, 1) yes this passive gives us powerful levers on when Cassiopeia hits power spikes, but its less about that and more about creating discrete moments where the Cassiopeia players *feels* like they've evolved. A gradual ramp pattern accomplishes the former, but not the latter so much (of course, 2-shotting a tower with Nasus does some of this, but that's pretty different).\n\nAs for 2), yeah the range and readability profile for Twin Fang is a much friendlier profile for DoTs than than the long-ranged, spammable AoE Q. That said, there's a lot to love about that Q pattern, so we wanted to preserve that while bringing it's best case to a more appropriate position.\n\nThe poor ability to switch targets a a really good point. The poison => twin fang reset loop is core on Cassiopeia, which is a gate no ADC has to jump through. \n\nThat said, I don't think your proposed changes address this. Target swapping is not out of volition but often necessity (the adc hits the tank because she has to, or else she will die). Likewise, Cassiopeia will have to hit the target shes presented with, and thus be unable to elongate poison duration on other targets (I suspect). Further, increasing poison duration undermines the core pattern of Q, EEEE, Q, EEEE, so on, replacing it with Q EEEEEEEEEEE so on. Fundamentally, I think having to weave in skillshots between Twin Fang sets is both fun to Cass players and more fair to their opponents. \n\nYou've identified an important point however, so let's talk more about that.  You say Cassiopeia has poor target selection, and I think that is totally valid. I wonder if it's possible to give her enough surrounding tools where shes comfortable having the disadvantage of even poorer target selection than an ADC. I suspect it is. For example, it's true that its more difficult for Cass to swap targets, but when she does, she gets a huge ms boost, which is not true of the additional ADC. If this is not strong/ interesting enough, maybe it can be bolstered, or maybe it can be rethought. Definitely an interesting debate wotth having.

What do you think?\n\nI think the MS boost you gain from landing a Q is balanced out by the fact you have to LAND the Q. An ADC just has to right click an enemy in range and they attack, but Cass has to land a skillshot. Said skillshot is blocked by BVeil, meaning she has to wait for her next W or Q, and if her E is blocked by Windwall or Braum's shield (and Braum is not poisoned) than she's locked out of her 'autoattack' for the next few seconds. Normal ADCs don't have to deal with that; sure, ADCs can't attack people behind the windwall, but they don't lose their right click if they accidentally do.","replies":[{"poster":"Thryale","date":"2014-11-02T21:04:23.231+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":1,"body":"This.

Why on Earth would you consider making it the basis for her new design? That seems extremely short-sighted and, frankly, dumb.\n\n2) Her new passive already makes her worthless on Dominion and Treeline (and much less useful than she used to be on ARAM). The updates you suggest would only make her *worse* on those maps. You understand this, right? Are you doing this on purpose? Oh, wait, I forgot. You don't give a rats ass about the other maps nor the people that play them.\n\nFrankly, new Cass is a load of crap. No changes to the current design would make her any better. Scrap it and start over or revert her to her previous state.  \n\nCass was *fun* as a lane bully and being a strong laner was not only core to her identity but essential to her playstyle.  Cass's new design is insanely counter-intuitive to the reality of her kit.\n\n-Her Q and W push the lane, but she's too squishy and doesn't deal enough damage to take advantage of it. She can't leave the lane to gank and she can't stay pushed thanks to her squishiness and lack of escape/1v2 ability. \n-Meanwhile, E is so short ranged that if she's using it to farm, she's too close to the enemy and will be forced into a trade that she is *designed* to lose. She is designed to lose lane.  \n-Since she no longer can spam Q/Ws thanks to not having her old passive, she *can't* farm effectively without using E to regain mana (and, if this is removed, she won't even be able to do that). So not only is she losing trades and pushing every time she tries to harass or trade with Q/W, she can't even out-push her opponent without going OOM or overextending.\n\nShe's basically worthless in lane *by design* now, and that is about as fun as playing Poppy in lane. Except with Cass, you don't scale into a 1v5 monster with a broken kit. Instead, if you manage to actually farm and get 400 stacks, you *might* live long enough to get an ult off before the enemy team murders you. You certainly won't get any actual DPS on them, and you have NO burst whatsoever so your life is totally meaningless unless you're left completely alone--which you won't be, since you need to be in E range to do any damage!\n\nIt's horrific design. Unfun and practically unplayable. Oh, and as mentioned, it makes her even *more* useless on Dominion where she cannot even get stacks! \n\nAnd let's not forget that changing her passive to stack over time just takes all the gameplay out of it, and makes her essentially an afk farming champ--wait long enough and you'll get your power for free, what a brilliant idea /sarcasm.\n\nYeah, no. None of this is good. Go back to the drawing board, you screwed up massively.\n\nEdit: And for the love of good taste, revert her champion select voiceover. \"Don't you find me...beautiful?\" was brilliant.

Which brings me to the next point:  **what is the original problem**?  You talk about it as if it's a given ... yet as someone who's read every one of these Cassi threads I can tell you is not clearly spelled out.  At all.  Only repeated pushing and a response from multiple Rioters have I been able to draw out a single \"thematic issue\" and a single \"mechanical issue\"  that Riot seems to be addressing:\n\n**Thematically her identity as a dot champion is overshadowed by other champions and thus not a clear part of her style, Riot would like to define a clear identity for Cass**\n\n**Mechanically you don't want her to be an early game lane bully but instead a scaling APC as thats a niche you feel can be unique vs. the other 120 champions**\n\nIs this correct?  If so it would be awesome if you lead the discussion by posting this clearly (kind of like I just did) then acted as a moderator to the thread and kept topics on track.  You can't just lay down your disappointment,  leave for 2 weeks, then come back with your exact proposal you mapped out, with no PBE testing, then act like we were no help in solving the problem and as if this whole feedback process is a waste of time.  I'd also like to point out that if this **is** correct, you yourself have done a terrible job stating what your proposed answer is thematically ... which is why you are getting such \"passionate\" response.

Passives don't need to be minigames to add gameplay or mastery to a champion. Deadly cadence worked on multiple fronts: it solved mana issues regarding her spamming nature once she all-ins a poisoned target. It created gameplay in the form of forcing you to keep using spells as both an incentive and a deterrent. An incentive to keep the spells coming, and a deterrent not to let it fall because the consequences of that is an increased expenditure of mana that could prevent you from executing your spammy kill pattern if the opportunity arises during the period you let your passive fade. And it *fit* Cassiopeia: she has a rhythm to her spellcasts, and the passive both acknowledged that and bolstered it. It was fantastic, and I don't know why people don't realize it. It was purely Cassiopeia. Cries for a \"more fun and fitting\" passive lead us to one that only reflects her because it includes \"serpent\" in the name and, as you said, tricks the player into believing he's poisoning people because that's means to an end other than poisoning people.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PUMPZILLA","date":"2014-11-01T05:53:13.604+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"Also, how does everyone feel about the current CD? 0.5 s might just be a little low, as it keeps Cassiopeia locked in place, casting E's and hardly being able to move.

Her E isn't fun to use because simply pressing a key over a target every half a second isn't fun. The old power in Q was really fun to play because the damage it dealt was high but it was also quite hard to land on moving opponents. Basically, you felt like you were actually interacting with the enemies through your positioning to get in range for Q and your prediction of their movements. Now Q is useless, because it's much easier to get E resets while they are in Miasma, rather than hitting Q. You should push power back into hitting the skillshot of Q instead of the targetted reset ability E.\n\nFor a champion with low mobility and no dashes, who has to stand still for all her abilities, a long delay on ult, she should be hard to play well. She should be rewarded extremely well for landing Q because as an immobile mage, focusing on her will blow her up. This is also why power shifting to E is bad, because she was never good in teamfights. The range is too low for her to safely E any target consistently. Pushing her power from anti-siege and poke to all in high DPS doesn't make sense when that's her biggest weakness. There needs to be mobility rewards on E if you want to make E the focus of her kit. But that's still a poor solution because E isn't exciting to use and enemies can't outplay it.

I'm particularly excited about the Q-fix.\n\nI've played many Cass games in D1 and Master; I hope to shed light on her performance in high-skill match-ups while also sharing a few thoughts from my end. I hope these can be of at least some help.\n\n1) Do not increase the E cooldown to 0.75s\n\nWhen Cass's E was bugged to 0.7s cd instead of 0.5s, she felt extremely clunky. The best Cassiopeia players are untouchable and mechanically proficient. They hit and run, slithering away from immediate threat but chasing right back after enemies when they think they're safe. I wouldn't deliberately make her E slower to encourage movement (in fact, it will weaken her kiting). Ideally, a good player will know to move while E'ing, and good enemies won't give her a chance to spam E while stationary (similar to ADC play style). I also wouldn't take away the experience of bombarding enemies with E. It feels so much more powerful and impactful. \n\n2) Sustain\n\nCass's ability to passively farm should be increased.\n\nWhile playing Cass in high elo match-ups, I noticed Cass gets destroyed every game around level 3 - 6. Of course, she SHOULDN'T be able to match her laning opponent early game, since she's a late game AP carry. However, she simply cannot withstand 95% of match-ups, because it's simply too easy to drive her out of lane. By the time she reaches 40-50 stacks, Cass gets bullied out of lane, especially under pressure from the jungler. She recalls only to be bullied harder once she's back, and with the level advantage, the enemy laner will most likely have obtained his/her ultimate before Cass and even before Cass gets 75 stacks. Once she obtains 75 stacks her laning phase does improve substantially, but at this point she is likely to be behind in experience and in gold by a significant amount.  Her situation is much worse than farming as a late-game adc like Vayne, equipped with early lifesteal, a support, and a repositioning tool (tumble).\n\nIf her enemy is sloppy about harassing Cassiopeia, he/she should be paranoid. The enemy laner should be thinking \"If I don't drive her out of lane / deny her / gangk her, she's going to destroy everyone in the game.\" Right now, even the sloppiest harass is able to drive Cass out of lane, and even with skillful play she can't stand toe-to-toe at all. Introducing sustain earlier into the game should strengthen her persistence, much like the poison that she is ;). These changes are necessary especially if the mana-refund on E is taken out.\n\n3) Mana Refund on E \n\nA couple of things regarding removing the mana refund on Cassiopeia's E. \n\nCurrently, her mana costs and cooldowns of her poison spells are devastatingly high. I find that she can't afford to poison freely until she recalls to get her first mana item, and even if she lands her poison, the damage is negligible. \n\nMore importantly, Cass's auto-attack is quite abysmal. Being able to last hit using E (especially early game when Q-W are not reliable last hitting tools) was incredibly refreshing.\n\nIf we do take out the mana refund on E there would have to be significant tweaks to the rest of her kit...but I'm no game designer so I won't go into that.\n\n\n4) A hyper late-game, DoT AP Carry\n\nI don't think we have one of these yet - I would love for Cass to take on this niche. I like the idea of allowing Twin Fang to increase poison damage so that we can prevent Cassiopeia from landing just one Q to deal 30% of someone's health. If she is able to stick to you and apply her poison while E-ing, your health should be going down super fast. \n\nA few people on forums said the changes you outlined would bring her right back to old Cassiopeia. I disagree - I do think there are ways to prevent this from happening with the right changes (such as E amplifying poison, mentioned above).\n\nI hope this was of at least some help.

I think this change will be fun to use and make her kit more fun, poison affecting poisons. Imagine the noxious blast exploding inside miasma and making it poof and spread haha It would be great! \n\nConcerning Cassi being the ideal archetypal poison mage, It would be hard to pull off in the current state of how her dot's work. It won't make her a strong contender against the many burst champions in the game. It just won't work without really making her op. Maybe we should entertain the idea of  her E and W increasing the number of ticks her Q did up to a set amount. It would not only make sense for a poison mage (as the more poisons on a target the more detrimental/damaging it should be to one target) but it would allow the whole combo nature of her poisons work cohesively in a really dynamic way. \n\nOtherwise I've really enjoyed her change of kit. To the people complaining about the passive I can't really understand where you are coming from. Her old passive was not that much better. \n\nUsing some other's people's logic in this thread it was basically 'Cassiopeia casts spells so why do you want to give her something she's going to be doing anyway?' vs 'Cassiopeia poisons people that's what she does so why this passive?'

Only the inept would be standing in one place spamming E when you do not need to. \n\nI hope some people's brash comments on your design choices/style don't get to you Stashu!

I played Cass a bit pre-rework and I loved spamming Q on people to harass. It wasn't uninteractive or anti-fun because it could be avoided and it could be baited out, and because a lot of Cass's DPS depended on landing it anyone with mobility could use their mobility spell to dodge Q and get onto Cass at the same time.

I don't like the new changes to it, but I'll get to that later.\n\n> * **I miss the long range, AoE, DoT pattern**\n\nThis is the other thing everyone misses about Cass. Her spell spam was definitely AoE and definitely DoT, but not really long ranged. Now, it's lost a lot of the AoE damage due to ratio and CD nerfs, it's lost a lot of DoT damage for the same reason, and it's still not long ranged. \n\n{{champion:99}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:115}} are all long ranged. Put Cassieopeia, pre or post rework, next to them. She really isn't a long ranged mage and she shouldn't be penalized on power budget as if she is one when her range is simply not comparable to that of actual artillery mages.\n\n> * **Aspect of the Serpent**\n\nIt's good that you understand that we hate Aspect of the Serpent, but you completely missed the point on WHY we hate it. We don't hate it because we have to kill minions to stack it; we were gonna be killing minions anyway so why not? We hate it because we're playing half a champion until 200 stacks, and then 3/4 of a champion until 400 stacks. **It's just not fun to deal with at all until 400 stacks** and giving us free stacks won't change that if you keep the power spikes at the same time in the game.\n\nI have an idea for a different passive but I'll post that up in a reply to this post because I'm already scraping up against the character limit as I type this and I do want to have a real discussion about the changes that are actually happening at the moment. \n\n> * **Noxious Blast**\n\nDelay fix will definitely help, no issues there. I wouldn't mind a little damage buff as well but there are other skills in greater need of that *coughMiasmacough*.\n\n> * **Miasma**\n\nOh man...I'm not very happy with the lack of changes on this spell. The maximum damage on it is 270 +0.9 AP, which looks really impressive until you realize that in order to land the full damage of this spell, some schmuck has to sit inside your poison cloud for **7 seconds**. If you can somehow lock somebody up inside the poison cloud for 7 seconds, you deserve a bigger reward then that. \n\nI'm not one to complain without offering solutions, so I'll post some in the next post as I'm running out of room here as is. \n\n> * **Twin Fang**\n\nThis was the best change in the rework IMO, and the debuff you plan on adding is definitely a really cool mechanic.

To me, the biggest problem is that you approached Cassiopeia as if she is by nature an unbalanced, too powerful champion, when she clearly wasn't even viable. If balance was an issue, old cassiopeia with her interactive passive and cool identity could have gotten the QoL changes she *deserved* - namely her fixed hitbox for ult and her added reliability to E - and, had she proved to be too powerful, fix her numbers accordingly, but you unilaterally decided, disregarding the continual contempt the meta has had for her, that her old kit was overpowered at its core. The results can be seen today: a champion nerfed across the board that feels utterly unsatisfying to play until she hits the point where she is as powerful as her old iteration (wasn't even viable!) at the only stage of the game that's not assured to reach, lategame. You could have saved yourselves the trouble. We were right on Lee Sin, right on Skarner and are right now.\n\nRegarding the proposed change, you're just moving her damage so Q becomes relevant. The fact that Q as a ranged harass tool lost its effectiveness is unaddressed. It will still feel unsatisfying and will still depend on hitting Es in a AP marksman Ryze 2.0 style.

Why do you not offer an explanation to why DoTs or AoEs are too powerful for a kit to hold when clearly old Cassio bore them fairly? If the problem with DoTs is their unpredictability, why didn't you target that and instead account for it in a way that requires power to be taken elsewhere? Why are we acting like they somehow do more damage than an instant damage skill when those don't allow for regeneration or damage avoidance methods after the fact? I assume AoEs aren't the problem since they're on every champion but two (?) in the game.\n\nI suggest you add visual aids for DoTs on the affected champion's health bar, coloring the section of the bar that will be taken by the next interval of damage differently so there's no mistaking how powerful an ability will be.

But the rework, no matter how hard you try to save it, is just fundamentally flawed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Khell DarkWolf","date":"2014-11-01T17:05:26.805+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Said it before and I'll say it again but I'll reword it:\n\n**I don't like** Aspect of the Serpent as a passive because everything about it from its inception to its conception to what it is today is flawed. Why?\n\n1.  It purposely gates her early and mid game from trying to achieve the rewards of building her items:\n * Because the ball of stats doesn't fit with her\n *  Since it gives stats (AP gains and other stuff), its give you an excuse to purposely keep her nerfed with junk AP Ratios which relates to not being able to feel rewarded for your items if you get kills or a lead in gold\n * If you get behind or wrecked in lane, its complete famine because catching up is now twice as hard to get those stacks\n\n2.  The Stacking mechanic is chorish, yes:\n * But applying an over time of obtaining stacks is just as worse as getting them, since you're not playing with the full aspects of your champion since it is locked\n * It promotes no skill differentiation between a player, farm stack based or time based since it doesn't matter whose playing behind the champion. The result is feast or famine as it'll come down to what happened during the laning phase and then whether or not you're more behind in gold for items.\n\n*  The fascination of making Cassiopeia a late game hyper carry:\n * I detest this very idea, because she was perfectly fine prior the rework and I did not pick up Cassiopeia nor any other Cass main to be a glorified Hyper carry without an early game. I told you guys before not to get too hooked up on the idea of making her late game better because any champion can a dream late game, but it'll always come down to how they perform during their early and midgame that determines if a player enjoys actually wanting to get to that late game.\n * This aspect could have been achieved with another champion and misses the mark because you chose to do it as a rework to differing playstyle that most were accustomed to. To remove a large portion of the player base that picked up for their reasons because what has decided to make her now is the main reason most of us as upset.\n* The Lost Identity and lack of choice:\n * I picked up Cassiopeia because I enjoyed the early game and still have a decent late game. Because I had the choice of either trying to whittle down my opponent to open the option to all in or I could stall the wave as I waited\n * Her combo nature was so prevalent back pre-work was another key moment to why I enjoyed her, but it was also because I had tools to try and keep zone control and I could punish them for not respecting that. Now it just doesn't feel way anymore with cooldowns nerfed on all her spells and in addition to her lower base and ratio damage because of the direction you guys want to push her.\n * Her playstyle now forces you to use Twin Fangs much more often, which I don't like because it shifted the way the champion felt before and I knew from before pre-work that if I didn't have time to use Twin Fangs on my opponent. It usually meant it would put me in a bad position and can get me killed since I know in current rework I have to stand there and fire off like a machine gun for longer periods of time as my whittling tool and killing tool since it is all about damage over time.\n * Since Aspect of the Serpent and the removal of Deadly Cadence, the choices of your first item buys are severely blackballed into grabbing a tear of the goddess. Because if you don't have the mana to keep up with the spam, more so now because you have to use twin fangs more often. You'll find yourself running oom faster then Kassadin spamming riftwalks.\n * I enjoyed the old Q and W, but with reduced base, AP ratios and a higher cooldown. Zoning tools and the ability to whittle down an opponent as a poison DoT mage are hampered and don't feel the same anymore. I know why too, because so long as she has that passive of Aspect of the Serpent giving her stats (but importantly the AP gains) you can't give her higher ratios.\n * It was said she was binary before, I won't argue that. But forced to use Q/W for twin fangs is just more so","replies":[]},{"poster":"Skia Asteri","date":"2014-11-01T01:49:59.343+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Now adds a debuff on the target which significantly amplifies further poison damage.\n\nJust her poison or the damage of all poison abilities?

The current system and the changed one both feel like your are punishing the player who picked Cass until you reached a certain point in the game and then she gets a bonus that puts her on par with other mages.  It doesn't enhance any aspect of her playstyle or reward you for holding out until late game.  \n\nCompare Cass to Annie.  They are both going to build similar items, but Annie sees more value from the items. Annie doesn't have to spam skills [zhonya disruption on Cass's primary play pattern of QEEEEE] and has pretty reasonable AP ratios (Cass's ratios currently are very very bad).  Cass's ratios are so bad that she gets to be even with Annie after the 40 minute mark, but annie still has a passive (at that point cass might as well not have one) that allows her to add utility/outplay potential to her team.\n\nThis actually goes beyond just Cass as other champions with \"scaling\" built into their kit usually are underbudgetted on their base stats (or ratios) and are just completely outclassed during the most important parts of the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NaNoSoLdIeR","date":"2014-11-01T16:38:19.736+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"First some tips on how we as a community would feel less neglected Stashu:\n1. Answer more posts, I've seen maybe 3 answers to the community from you, Morello seems to have commented more by now on these threads than you.\n2. Stick this discussion so that everyone has access to it, like the other reworks do.\n3. Stop insisting that E is a DOT spell just because it can be spammed, it's a nuke that can be spammed under certain conditions there's a difference acknowledge it.\n\nThese 3 things will probably take care of most of the angry posts that I see lying around.\n \nNow onto Cassiopeia.\n\nStop focusing on the goddamn e, Please and Thank You.\n\nHer e was an addition to her poison damage and you turned it into a mandatory-if-you're-not-using-this-spell-you-don't-do-damage spell. Although there are some people that like this, i'll grant you that one, it's not why people played her before the rework. \n\nI'd be okay with the current play pattern if it was another champion and if the other abilities/ranges enabled Twin fangs reliability. Either more range on E or being able to cast Q/E while moving, or even a mix of both. But I can't stress this enough **this wasn't the identity of Cass**, and after reading through most of the comments in this post it's not the community will, the community feels like your jamming this character design through our throats.\n\n> In actual fact, DoT’s do a lot more damage than anyone realizes, and often times so do AoE’s, so in order for Cassiopeia to be balanced as a long-range AoE DoT dealer, she’d have to take some significant hits. We had to make a choice here, and we went with giving her the most potent DoTs on single targets. Cass can still apply DoT from long range, but accessing her full power requires commitment to a single target (with E). This way we can give Cass meaningful DoT power on single targets instead of weak DoTs to all enemies. Fishing from long range with Qs and Ws is an important and fun part of her play pattern that we want to keep.\n\nI'm one of the persons that misses the dot aoe long range spells, I've pretty much come to terms that I'll never be playing old Cass and that's fine, but please remove from your head the notion that her being able to spam her E makes her a DOT mage (\"This way we can give Cass meaningful DoT power on single targets\"), being able to spam E, and being able to reliably spam E are two very different things. Only in the best of best case scenarios does she become a single target nuke spammer mage, the average use case is very different than her best case scenario, and this is what worries me about your whole design decisions on a Dot mage.\n\n\nAlso please answer this question, was the rampant scripting on her a cause for her rework to shy away so much from the q and w?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2014-11-01T03:53:43.893+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"Please upvote or reply to this message, I think I have some very important things to say about everything stashu is trying to do here.\n\nMana changes: without any mana refund mechanic, it seems like cass will have infathomable mana issues in lane and when she's looking low on mana there won't really be anything she can do. you said mana costs will be adjusted accordingly but it sounded like that would only be for E, not Q or W and in any case i don't see how mana cost reductions can ever replace those massive refunds.\n\n\nTwin Fang cooldown reset: if twin fang still only did direct damage, i would definitely support an increased cooldown to .75 sec or 1 sec with a slightly increased damage per cast to keep cass from feeling like some kind of weird turret, but because part of e's damage is the effect on cass's Q and W damage, i think the current 0.5 second cooldown will be fine, as cassiopeia won't really NEED to spam E as much as possible to get the most out of the damage (one E every once in a while will give her a lot of poison damage and she wouldn't mind more e's if possible, but can forego them and keep moving without feeling useless)\n\n\nThe Passive: your proposed changes to the passive may have addressed some concerns, but mine were not that csing poisoned minions felt really annoying. it kinda did, but that actually felt like a more interesting minigame like you wanted it to although 1 stack per cs was VERY unrewarding and made farming feel ineffective. my issue with cassiopeia's passive was that the primary source for stacking by a large margin was (and still would be) from engaging the enemy when cassiopeia is being made into a hypercarry that will, by definition, lose early trades with the enemy.\nI would actually be happier with the passive if all or most of the stack sourcers were from the current minion farming minigame. I know that sounds counterintuitive with how much riot wants champions to always be interacting, but as a hypercarry cassiopeia wants to avoid the enemy in the early stages of the game and farm and this will make farming slightly harder (it forces her to push the lane slightly and her cs windows shorten) and makes the enemy really want to engage her and try to stop her from farming. I think this is the appropriate play pattern in lane for a hypercarry vs. a standard laner or lane bully and I think you should STRONGLY CONSIDER THIS SUGGESTION EVEN THOUGH IT INITIALLY SEEMS COUNTERINTUITIVE\n\n\nOverall it still seems like new cassiopeia has a nonsense play pattern of engaging the enemy early and losing trades so you get pushed out of lane or even give up kills so that in the late game you can deal a lot of damage to single targets but still get blown up because you're squishy as hell and have very little mobility or cc. Some of the changes do seem to be in the right direction as the E change may give cass better lategame damage while kiting and staying safe, as well as improving her multitarget damage if she puts her poison amp on multiple targets by e'ing all over the place. The mana rebalance without the refund mechanic should also open up build options since cassiopeia will not need a massive mana pool from tear and/or roa to maximize her cs refunds. If the E poison amp were to work in such a way that it was some kind of always-relevant damage (when cassiopeia is high level to encourage her lategame role, of course) through %hp, true damage, or just high bases it would go even farther towards this as cassiopeia could build tankier and let her poisons do the work in addition to the glass cannon option and letting her stupidly high ratio, rapid-fire e do the work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheUltimateSpear","date":"2014-11-02T23:30:33.213+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, first post on the boards, so please bare with me.\n\nNow, I'm currently low Silver. I do not pretend to be brilliant at this game. I don't pretend I'm an expert on game design and character design. What I can say, however, is that I love Cassiopeia. She was the first champ I bought with IP, way back when I started playing in August of 2013. Her 2nd splash art still gives me the sense of intriguing and novelty that comes with trying a new game.  Even though I become quite frustrated with my on-and-off success with her, I never gave her up, because she just felt right to play. And with that, thoughts below.\n\n**Stashu, my friend, you said that for Cassiopeia to become an AOE, DOT mage, she'd have to take some pretty significant hits.**\nAre you sure? Cassiopeia has mediocre to average range, no cc on a basic ability, no escapes, and is quite squishy. She had these flaws before and she has them now. Are they not enough?\n\n**The removal of Deadly Cadence and  the addition Aspect of the Serpent**\nOkay, let me explain why I loved Deadly Cadence. This passive gave Cassiopeia a sense of rhythm and momentum and focus and **reinforcing that I had to really be there when i played her.** Let me elaborate on what I mean. As I said Cassiopeia is squishy, mediocre ranged, no hard cc on a basic ability, and has no escapes. These, for me, were sometimes frustrating, but they **made me stay alert, and engaged, and made me have FUN.** For me, all champs become old hat in time, even the likes of Syndra who is also (suppposed to be lol that retarded hitbox) a high skillcap champion. But, Cass didn't. I may have never really done well with consistency on her, but I never stopped being alert and engaged, even when other champs lost their novelty. And, I think the new passive maybe kinda takes that from her. It says, stack back, farm up, bide your time. New creep wave, poison, e farm, wait. Until late game, where I throw down a w on someone who jumps on me and then sit there and spam e and 9 out of 10 times they'll get shredded.  Or, chase them down absolutely relentlessly and spam my huge fangs at them. New Cass can melt faces mid and late game, but she also is just as likely to get picked off because she needs to be in that range of the e to be truly impactful. **Anyways, the sense of weaving through  the battlefield and around my opponent just isn't the same.** Plus, removing deadly Cadence forces Cass to build tear, because going Rod of Ages and +10 mana item like morello's won't cut as it goes overboard and makes you waste CDR.  And many times, players will build both, gimping their early game even harder.\n\n**Fun factor**\nCassiopeia right now just isn't very fun. It's not fun to get murdered until 200 stacks and then turn around and murder others with impunity yourself. Well, maybe it's not that it's not fun. **It may be that Cassiopeia's sheer versatility has been axed.** Before, Cassiopeia could max q or e depending on her opponent; ranged poke or dueling? Cassiopeia could choose between the two, and it was one of her few reliable points. I really like the poison changes you intend to add, but they still make her a duelist type champion, and thus emphasize the riskier of Cassiopeia's two previous playstyles. (Getting in range with E) Also, I really liked being a lane bully, but if it has to go, I'm willing to compared to other things.\n\n*State of actual power*\nHoh boy. Cassiopeia now is dicey to play. A significantly supbar early game makes it so that her teammates better be going even or winning because she can't help them.  Even when she get's those stacks, the poke from q and w, while actually decent, isn't better than other mages. She only gets her shot once a teamfight's initiated, and she's still super vulnerable. That said, i think she's weak, but not as much as everyone else. You can do decently with her, but looking at overall power, I'd say it was a reduction.\n\nThat concludes my post. I hope Stashu that you really think this one over, if only because I grew fond of Cass before any other champ, and I miss her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2014-11-01T18:59:22.797+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im not even a Cass player and I don't understand the stacking mechanic on her passive.

Anyways, the main problem that I have with the rework stems from the gating that the passive puts on Cassiopeia.  For comparison, let's look at Vayne: she scales very hard into late game, just like Cassio should, and is also considered a relatively short-range hypercarry.  The big difference between Vayne and the current Cassio is that if I pick up a few kills, manage to cs better than my opponent, or outplay the other team in some way, my reward as Vayne is that I can pick up items that significantly increase my damage output.  As Cassio, the major gateway to high damage output is through her passive now, as her AP scalings aren't that great.  As such, if I outplay the other team in some way, or if my jungler camps my lane and gets me a few kills, there really isn't much of a reward - there's no way to accelerate the passive via zoning, kills, etc.  This ends up causing a situation where no matter how well I play the champ, I still won't have much of an effect on the game pre-30 minutes.  \n\nThe real question is: how should this issue be addressed?  My suggestion would be increasing the number of stacks gained based on how much damage Cassio does to her opponent.  Did Cassio land a Q?  Scale the stacks gained not by the time the other champ is poisoned, but rather by how much poison damage they take.  Did Cassio land an E?  Perhaps the more damage that E does, the more stacks Cassio gets.  This way, if the Cassio player manages to get a gold lead in lane, that lead will actually have an effect.","replies":[]}]}
