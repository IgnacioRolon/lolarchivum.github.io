I've been waiting to get some PBE feedback. I'm finally able to make that happen now that 4.20 launched, so let's get to it =D\r\n\r\nI think we had some amazing conversations in that last thread thread. We're keeping the changes to a medium scope for this patch, but I think we've gone a long way in the right direction. I know there are still many concerns, but let's let this shake out on live for a bit and see where she ends up, then revisit the conversation.\r\n\r\nOur thinking for this current changelist is\r\n\r\n * Bring back poison as a core part of Cassiopeia's damage profile\r\n * Curb the overly exaggerated hyper carry curve so that she can function early game\r\n  * A few different things are happening here, like adding straight damage to her early game with the Twin Fang debuff, increasing Twin Fang's ratio early game, and increasing Q's movement speed boost early game. We're also bringing down her late game a touch with some of these changes, but her DPS should still be off the charts.\r\n\r\nLooking further into the future, hopes are to turn *Aspect of the Serpent* bonuses into more exciting, lateral-power points instead of super direct boosts to power which make it feel as if Cassiopeia can't be strong until 30 minutes into the game. There was some pretty serious brainstorming towards this end, and it was a huge help for thinking about where we could take the passive, and that was super awesome.\r\n\r\nHowever, for now, here's what you can expect for 4.21:\r\n\r\n* **Aspect of the Serpent**\r\n * No longer stacks on poisoned unit kill or on Twin Fang casts on enemy champions.\r\n * Now, stacks once every 6 seconds (10 times per minute) and for every second that an enemy champion is poisoned.\r\n   * Stack breakpoints adjusted to 100 / 250 / 500. Overall, these are hit sooner than the old 75/200/400 based on the new mechanics, but are definitely still up for discussion. \r\n* **Noxious Blast**\r\n * Delay changed to actually function as intended (previously hitting between 0.25 and 0.5s). Now has a 0.4s delay.\r\n   *  With the reliability changes, it was a bit *too* reliable, so we set the delay at 0.4.\r\n * Movement speed buff changed to a flat 20% (from 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 / 30%). \r\n* **Twin Fang**\r\n * Mana cost changed to 35 / 45 / 55 / 65 / 75 (from 30 / 45 / 60 / 75 / 90)\r\n * ** Now adds a debuff on the target which amplifies further poison damage by 25% for 5 seconds, stacks up to 2 times (50%). **\r\n * Ratio changed to 0.55 (from 0.4/0.45/0.5/0.55/0.6) \r\n   *  Since we're adding damage elsewhere on the kit (mostly through this debuff), we decided to take a bit out of Twin Fang's late game.\r\n\r\nCheers!","replies":[{"poster":"Scampy","date":"2014-11-20T20:18:20.104+0000","up_votes":70,"down_votes":14,"body":"To repeat what I said in another thread, if you're so hell-bent on keeping this gutter trash passive, at least clean it up. Make the 25% CDR into 20% so we can actually get Athene's without going over the cap. This would free up some power to give to the first breakpoint so hitting 75 stacks feels like less of a waste of time. Give a big ol' chunk of stacks upon killing a champ, because as it stands I'm better off to keep spamming poison without killing my lane opponent so I can get more stacks out of them. Just a 5-10 stack bonus on kill would be a huge improvement. Not enough to make us like it, but enough to make her a bit less garbage until you stop trying to force this crap on us and actually listen to what the players want.\n\nAnd no, it's not because of communication issues or weak release power levels leaving a sour taste in our mouths. We're not in 3rd grade, stop treating us like angry children who don't know what they want. We're not petty enough to be this adamant about hating something if we don't really, **really** [hate it](http://i.imgur.com/9lIKkOA.png). There are so many better ways to control a champion's scaling, and clearing out Aspect of the Serpent would leave a huge space for a creative passive. You could reintroduce Deadly Cadence (one of the coolest passives this game ever had), you could give her bonuses for poisoning multiple enemies at once, give stacking debuffs based on how long a champ is poisoned and have those debuffs become exacerbated when she lands X twin fangs on the target, etc.\n\nI still don't get why you want an evolve passive on Cass in the first place.

Cass still has a huge neon sign in lane that says \"CAMP ME\" and nothing you're doing is really helping. \n\nI'll also touch on stacking the passive. Like the guy above said, we really need some better ways to accelerate the stacking process by making big plays. Champion kills/assists are a good starting point, but what I'm wondering is why we can't get more than one stack at a time? If we got a stack for every poisoned enemy champion, you'd reward well aimed skills while making the enemy think twice about ganging up on you all the time.\n\nYou say you want a serpent theme, but it's extremely rare that you get rewarded in a big way by outsmarting the enemy, which is something that would work much better into the character dynamic than the current steaming pile of \"hyper\" scaling.","replies":[]},{"poster":"no its becky","date":"2014-11-21T07:45:50.748+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":28,"body":"> I still don't get why you want an evolve passive on Cass in the first place.

Also I am immediately inclined to believe the exact opposite of anything Morello says or does for \"game health\" is true, and stashu has proven repeatedly to be completely clueless. So your appeal to authority is doing you far more harm than good here.\n\nAnd people agree with those of us yelling louder about how this rework is utter trash made by incompetents because we are the side of reason. Being \"constructive\" isn't agreeing with everything Riot does. It's explaining repeatedly and thoroughly why everything about this rework is wrong and terribly designed and then, apparently, being completely ignored by an egotistical moron obsessed with literally the dumbest passive that could ever be made.\n\nWell, until Kalista came out, at least.

With her poison damages being boosted by her E and with a more reliable delay time on Q, her abusiveness has gone down significantly. Accordingly, we've been able to stuff quite a bit more power into her early game, to the point where she seems strong even without the passive. In addition, with the more distinct stacking mechanisms on the passive being removed, it plays less of a part in her moment-to-moment gameplay. She still cares a lot about getting the heal on E and playing around that, but the AP bonuses are mostly just flaor at this point as her damage is effective without them and doesn't really take off until the third breakpoint anyway, which is where the game really accelerates and the success and failure of fragile champions like Cassiopeia is on a knife's edge, which makes it sort of useful but not game-deciding in either direction. \n\nSo with that in mind, we generally feel: \n\n* Happy with Cassiopeia's core gameplay pattern, including the mana return, poison amp, and vamp mechanics.\n* Not happy with the current state of the passive. Main problems being:\n  *  It doesn't significant change the way Cassiopeia acts/thinks about her kit, which is a bit problematic as part of the fantasy being delievered here is \"building power,\" so if Cassiopeia doesn't feel likes she's doing anything to build it, something is off.\n    *   This was less true in the last iteration (with poisoned unit kills), but that was too far in that direction and became very chore like.\n  *  The promise of ascending power over the course of the game could be a lot more exciting than it currently is.\n   *   That said, *the promise* itself is exciting, and there is some success here (namely the first breakpoint), but it could go a lot further.\n\nSo! The current changes bring Cassiopeia into a much better place, and the passive has been de-emphasized in the kit a bit for now, but we're not done working her. This was a big discussion in the previous threads, but basically we're looking to make the passive both more fun to build and more exciting to use when it actually manifests. We got a lot of good suggestions from the boards which was really awesome, and we'll be thinking about them as we move forward.

Did you ever attempt to change the rewards on her passive for example?\n\nHave you tried giving her flat ap-gains instead of an unreliable ap percentage-bonus which only favors glasscannon-builds? Even if you manage to approach the stackcap at a decent pace, it'll be useless without the necessay ap-items in your possession.\n\nAlso you need to put some power into her W, it's terribly disappointing to use.

I'm gonna play around in this poison puke that's hurting me even more.\"  You'd need to be chasing them down, gung ho, to keep poison on them, which puts you too far out of position and turns you into gank bait.\n\n{{champion:17}}  and {{champion:29}}  get to be defined by their poison abilities. {{champion:69}} gets defined by waiting for 30 minutes until she can spam a non-poison spell as much as possible on a target that's poisoned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Scarborough Fair","date":"2014-11-20T20:35:10.726+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"Also, change passive name to \"Serpent's curse\"\naspect of the serpent is so bleh","replies":[{"poster":"Tendrian","date":"2014-11-20T20:51:06.683+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":2,"body":"> Also, change passive name to \"Serpent's curse\"\n> aspect of the serpent is so bleh\n\nBut it fits perfectly, considering how bleh the passive is.","replies":[{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2014-11-20T23:57:05.847+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"On the other hand, you gotta give her credit for accuracy.\n\n\nHer Passive really is a CURSE isn't it?

I've read basically every Riot post from the beginning of this rework til this point and so I'm going to offer my 2 cents into the discussion. This will be a critical write up and I will try to include every bit of information I possibly can.\n\nFirst off I'd like to make a comment on how this rework was handled. For one it was highly rushed through PBE, even though there was tons of criticism from the very beginning. There was minimal Riot communication through this stage and it translated into how the rework was released. Horribly. Then the next forum that began, \"Lets Talk Cassiopeia,\" was horribly handled as well. The player base presented mass amounts of criticism from the get go. Not much of it was actually addressed and the responses that were received by reds were mostly responses to positive and/or neutral feedback. Very little critical feedback was addressed. But the critical feedback didn't just stop, it continued for 300 PAGES of discussion, almost 90 percent devoid of Riot involvement. I had filed a complaint during this time and was told it was due to World's and that Riot was basically a mad house at the time. This was horrible planning on Riots part to release a rework so close to World's and absolutely shouldn't have been done. Anyway the discussion has moved to the boards and although the reds involvement has been better, it has still been, for the most part, a negative experience. Much of the criticism from the previous threads still exist, but much of it still goes unanswered.\n\nThe reasons for the change have, in my opinion, been completely unwarranted and uncalled for. Riot says Cass was an overbearing lane bully and her pattern of play was a negative impact on the game. Hearing this I will examine other, similar, lane bullies. Lets take Syndra for instance, she has similar range on her Q, which is instant damage btw, better self peel, and a targeted instakill ultimate that can kill squishies from 3/4 health. Another oppressive bully is Xerath, who has better range, better AOE with MR shred, a stun and a slow that does more damage than Cass's slow with about the same range and aoe. These Champions, among others are much more oppressive lane bullies than old Cass. So when you say you changed Cass because she was too oppressive a laner, I have no idea what the heck you're talking about.\n\nCass's change in identity does not fit her gameplay wise. She used to be a strong, not overbearing, laner, with a strong mid game, and an average to weak late game. In lane Cass had access to good wave clear, risky but good harass, but was vulnerable to early ganks pre-6. Mid game she transferred well into mid game teamfighting through her strong aoe damage and cc. Late game though she fell off slightly but would still be plenty relevant. Especially as a tank killer through building rylais and liandries. In my opinion no AP champ killed tanks better than old Cass. Her dots were reliable and relatively safe late game. Also if the enemy team was lacking tanks then building a more damage oriented build was still very effective. Now though Cass has bad early damage, bad mid game, and an average to strong late game. Early she has no damage, mana issues and is still vulnerable to ganks. Mid game she contributes almost nothing to mid game team fights. Late game she finally has access to her damage but she still has major issues. For one her range is awful, as well as lacking any reliable dash or escapes, these things combined make her incredibly susceptible to cc and being dove and deleted in teamfights, even with excellent positioning.\n\nOne last thing I'd like to to make a mention of is how unreliable her damage is due to her inability to switch targets reliably.(character limit, continued in post below)","replies":[{"poster":"IndyBoy","date":"2014-11-21T02:05:56.844+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"2/2\nCass's damage relies on Cass being able to land both Q and then follow up with E, E is worthless if used by itself. Let me put it this way, late game Cass's Q with 40 percent CDR is on I believe a 2.4 second cooldown with a short delay after cast. Assume you miss your Q on the correct target in a teamfight or you hit your Q and have to now switch targets in that teamfight. Now you have to wait another 2.4 seconds to cast another Q just to be able to contribute properly to the teamfight. 2.4 seconds is an eternity in a teamfight. Also assuming she lands the second Q, whose to say she wont have to change targets AGAIN. She just doesn't posses the ability to switch targets at the click of a mouse like an adc. This combined with the fact that Cass has much lower ranges than most adc's and has to remain completely IMMOBILE while casting abilities makes her completely unreliable in a teamfight scenario.\n\nThese are most of my issues with this rework Stashu, I'd really like it if you talked about some of these pleaseeeeeeeeeeeee. Especially after I took so much time to type all this out. I really hope none of this came across as rude, that was never my intention.

I absolutely hate it, and it is never going to be as effective as an AD marksman carry, and her AoE damage is absolutely pitiful. Until your rework, she was an early game AoE mage. You changed every strength and weakness she had. That is not the tone of a rework, that is designing a new champion.\n\nI don't care if she ever becomes viable in her hypercarry role if everything I loved about her for ***YEARS*** is gone. I loved her poisons, but now they are so weak 'because hey E does damage' that champs can ignore Q and W damage completely if they aren't accompanied by Es. It does not feel good to play a champ with only one powerful damaging ability.\n\nI feel like you are completely ignoring this fact, and also ignoring that in the process you alienated a large dedicated Cass playerbase. I tried to like this rework. I really did. But I absolutely hate everything about the single target hypercarry role and I absolutely hate everything about all the power being crammed into E. Don't even get me started on the ridiculous stacking passive.\n\nNot that I expect you will ever care or change her back seeing how it has been months since the rework surprise launched, but I want you to at least know that you took my favorite champion and removed all fun from playing her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elyviere","date":"2014-11-20T22:14:34.461+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Out of a purely game design perspective, I'd love your insight on this response to your comment [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/zuL472BJ-cassiopeia-plans?comment=00160002)\n\nIn regard to you talking about the 0 dodgeability from Miasma, I'd like to throw in a comparison to Ziggs E, as there are a lot of similarities between the two. They have roughly the same AoE (Miasma starts smaller, ends the same size), roughly the same slow (Miasma has 5% higher at all ranks), but the damage is in completely different leagues. \n\nZiggs single target damage caps at 700 + 150% AP, whereas Cassiopeia's damage caps at 270 + 90% AP. This is perhaps not a very realistic scenario though, since you won't even stand in a full Miasma just as you won't get hit by all the Ziggs bombs. Just looking at one bomb instead of all 11 though, it takes almost 5 seconds in Miasma to reach the damage from just **one** of the 11 ziggs mines. That's almost the entire duration of Miasma. \n\nNow I have to say, I probably consider Ziggs E to be unfair rather than Cassiopeia's Miasma to be weak, but when you have two abilities this similar, they should at least be roughly equal, or have different tradeoffs in strengths. As is now, Ziggs seems to have all the power but none of the weakness (unless a tank voluntarily clears a path through Ziggs minefield to clear for his teammates, but that damage is HUGE!).\n\nSo, in order to equalize Miasma compared to Ziggs E, it should certainly have some strength that Ziggs E lacks. The only advantage I can find are a shorter CD (10 secs vs 16s) and the ability to hit multiple targets. I also considered the fact that it allows Cassio to follow up with her E for further damage, but similarly Ziggs minefield lets him follow up with his Q, so it didn't come to any affect. I also find the shorter CD to be equalized by Ziggs longer duration of his E (10s compared to Cass's 7s), instantly larger AoE (i.e. less counterplay) and the fact that nobody in their right mind would stand in Miasma for over 5s, and there is no cc that will lock down a target that long anyway. And even if the entire team of five people do decide to stand in Miasma for 5s, it still only does 1050 + 350% AP damage vs Ziggs damage of 1036 + 210% AP when he hits 5 targets with the minefield (getting hit by all 11 mines). Lets be fair here, the above situation is Completely unrealistic (an entire team will never stand in a miasma for five seconds), however Ziggs will be able to land most of, if not all of, his mines in a fight. \n\nThis in my mind shows that a much more powerful miasma would not be at all unreasonable, since there clearly already exists a similar ability that is considered balanced in the game. \n\n**Suggestions**\nNow, in regard to improving miasma, I have the following suggestions for improvements (not all at once obviously). My favourite are definitely the changes that combine with the passive as they make both miasma and the passive more interesting. \n\n*Straight-up changes*\n\n* Increased damage [so not interesting, please don't]\n* Better slow\n* Longer poison duration after leaving the area (2s --> 3s perhaps). [Not a big fan of this one, it lacks Clarity]\n* Increased AoE radius (preferably only increase *either* the original size [125] *or* the final size [250])\n* Have it reach maximum radius earlier, then stay there for a few seconds\n* Cooldown reduced slightly whenever E gets a reset cooldown. [Could potentially allow for multiple miasmas at once, which I just think seems fun, although potentially OP. Slow/Damage would potentially have to be lowered, depending on the CD reduction from E]\n\n*Passive-integrated changes*\n\n* Start it with a lower slow (15%?) that goes up 5%/lvl, but then doubles when reaching x stacks of the passive (so at max rank with passive, 30% * 2 = 60% slow)\n* 50% increased radius upon reaching a certain amount of stacks\n* Allow for multiple stacks of miasma upon reaching certain points in the passive (like Azir's soldiers). Example: For every 100 stacks, allow for an extra miasma stack. (Would almost certainly require lower damage, radius and slow. Perhaps even increasing the duration for the poison to originally apply. This would help her with switching targets!)","replies":[{"poster":"Padagi","date":"2014-11-20T22:35:36.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":14,"body":"Why are you comparing Miasma and Ziggs mines?

We are talking right down to the ratios.

I'm trying my best to keep things pushing forward, trying to leave my thumbprint if you will in a positive way and be that part of the community that makes this game awesome, and I'm irritated.  Not that my ideas weren't jumped on (ok maybe a little, but I'm known to have an ego nearly as big as my di...display), but irritated that it at least appears that *nobody's* ideas were taken in.\n\nOK, obligatory soapbox moment gone.  Lets dig into that bit of content that IS new.  Namely this:\n\n>Looking further into the future, hopes are to turn Aspect of the Serpent bonuses into more exciting, lateral-power points instead of super direct boosts to power which make it feel as if Cassiopeia can't be strong until 30 minutes into the game. There was some pretty serious brainstorming towards this end, and it was a huge help for thinking about where we could take the passive, and that was super awesome.\n\nIs there *any* insight you can give into what ideas sparks the most promise to you?  Yes:  we will try to sway you in another direction if we think it's wrong ... but even those general glimpses are very valuable.  At the risk of repeating what was said in other threads:  I view the thematic consistency of Sion as the new bar.  What does Cassiopeia say as a champion and how does she say it not only in imagery but as well as in kit and playstyle?  How could these new power points add depth to her identity and not just be ... well .. stats?  It forces us to ask:  \n\nOr to spin this another way:  define Cass for us?  If Sion is \"unstoppable juggernaut\", what is our Monster Girl to you/Riot?  Get that definition out and lets see if that's what the kit says and if it doesn't, build a passive that does.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stez007","date":"2014-11-21T00:27:08.631+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thanks for making her even weaker on non-SR maps.

Give me tools to at least survive lane phase against stuff like Yasuo, Fizz, Zed than can just \"outplay\" your ultimate really easily with ther kits.\n\n Karthus still has his pasive, Ryze is still Ryze, and for the other mages with low cd on their primary skills, like oriana, syndra, ziggs, xerath,  they have a burst easier to land, than Cass ult, to speak off, from a safe distance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saevum","date":"2014-11-24T05:12:09.236+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Raging about Cassy's current condition wont help, just make a list of WHY the path currently taken has nothing to do with the previous bully-like-feeling kit (it wasn't bully, if you knew what Cassy could do or not do).\n\nOld **Kit regarding** (this is for those who did not played old Cassy).\n\nThe passive played the center role, making the entire skills cheaper than they should be, and it wasn't op; there were conditions for this to happen.\n\n**Passive** - 10% to 50% less mana costs on spells when you spam spells.\n**Q **- was meant to be spammable, also, being the best cost-effective skill of the entire kit (along with the passive i must say).\n**W** - was meant to be triggered (or used) after the Q triggered the passive enough to make W more cost-effective per use.\n**E** - Same story as W, but, this one was your main-dish-out-dps killing skill. High cost, but with a good passive synergy. There were conditions for this to happen and make it spammable too.\n\nOld **Gameplay regarding** (inside an actual ranked game)\n\nGame starts, you put a point in the Q (it was a rule). Poke, Damage and movement speed all in one. Low cost, along with the passive making it even more cost-effective.\n\n**You level 2!** - you put a point quickly in her E (it was almost a rule too). And you proceed to duel your current opponent with a good dps dish out (for the level) plus a little ignite. Then you may harass, and/or deny farm, etc etc. Making enemy jungle guy do a mid visit. (This is the point where she was considered a lane bully).\n\nThe rest of the story its an 'Etc, etc'.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNew Cassy - don't work. Thanks for reading. \n\nj/k.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe New passive of New passive if i'm correct.\n\nHow's that? - No passive till stacks filled. Fun right?\nNO. Not fun.\n\nBasically you start the game without a functional passive for the OLD kit. You cant mix water and oil. New passive? well, NEW KIT MAN that's the rule.\n\n*Cassiopeia was meant to spam her abilities. Basic rule of her kit: new Cass runs out of juice too fast, i mean, TOO FAST.\n\nSo, if you don't creep score, you can't have the mana refund, then, if you poke, you can't have that mana refund neither. So... what's the problem? There's an enemy in front of you, that if you don't poke, he just end up out-poking you. And if that happens, you will end up with no stacks. Tricky right? is the mana the problem? - in a part yes, is the new cooldown the new problem? - of course! cause it wasn't there before! -  are the stacks part of the problem? you begin with nothing like Nasus, so, i gotta say, Yes. OH, WAIT! SILLY ME! Nasus is not THAT squishy and he begins with a 10% life steal passive.\n\nSee the point? she's not a mid (anymore). Even Anivia starts with a passive. Even tho it may seem otherwise. Cassy is not a jungler (at all), she's not a support, nor anything in the current meta with the current competition against the current picks. Then, what is she? You can't place her in mid, she will lose the lane (in the hands of anyone), the team will rage, and the problems still go on. And even if she makes it to the late game (if there is a late game), some cc, gg, wp, bye bye.\n\nAnd then, you login to **LoL Boards**, and a new thread is there (with a sign similar to): 'wah, wah, qq, buff buff, pls pls' title. Then you click it and guess what?\n\nthey're are talking about *Cassiopeia's rework* (and future reworks it seems) of the next patch notes, regarding about that champ, that used to be a good pick, it was still competitive (in good hands) and now its not, and its the Bread of the day by day *Thread discussions*. Its a fun trip over and over if you ask me (reading posts, then, playing her, then coming back to qq about it) etc etc.\n\nPersonally, i'm not here to QQ, but to say: new kit or new passive. To make her work and diminish the qq threads for a while.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNeed ideas? WELL! YOU COULD HAVE STARTED WITH THAT! we ain't gonna tell you how to do what you do, but hey, listen opinions and suggestions to make this work. PPL MOSTLY WANT FUN. its a game! let's make a fun kit! and let Rito balance team do Rito balance team magic (we will argue/rage with them anyway, so, why delay it and suffer it yourself? - you're a kit designer, have fun like CertainlyT does).\n\nSo, now.\nSuggestion of passives (note: may need tweaks cause they're prototype version of whatever could may work): \n\n1.Passive - Every 6 stacks, Cassiopeia extends her mana pool by 3%. Stacks are obtained by eliminating units. Counts as 6 stacks per champion kill.\n\n2 Passive - Mana regeneration is increased by 0.3% every 3 minutes.\n\n3 Passive - Gorgoneion eyes - As long as enemies are facing or closely in front of Cassiopeia, they start to get reduced movement speed,\nand attack speed by 4~5% per second (capped at 20%). (750~930 range). Additionally, they suffer a (-10) magic resist reduction. (glowing eyes can be placed above champions. Similar to nidalee's traps)\n\n4 Passive - All attacks poison, additionally, your mana pool is extended by +9 for each second a unit is poisoned.\n\n5 Passive - All attacks deal poison, poison deals 0.2% of the target's current health as damage per second. Additionally, Cassiopeia build stacks according to the number of units she kills. Each stack provide 0.07% of mana regeneration.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHope you like text walls.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Khell DarkWolf","date":"2014-11-21T07:04:50.256+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Again, the passive is the center of the first problem and the major focus still tied into twin fangs.\n(Note: I'm going to post a rework suggestion in the next post under this)\n\nWe don't like the idea of being gated by an arbitrary mechanic so early to be useless to have to wait until a certain minute mark to become relevant.\n\nIt is no different then saying a rework for Garen{{champion:86}}  or Poppy {{champion:78}} and flipping their respective strengths during the early to late game.\n\nGaren {{champion:86}} while known for early game advantages is still a niche pick and while atm has some late game fantasy, there are ALOT more overwhelming number of champion matchups that bend him over then what the number of champions he can counter or thrive in an environment.\n\nNone the less, if you made him weak early like the current rework Cassiopeia and way better late game (like the cassiopeia rework that is claimed) I still would be upset. \n\nWhy? Because that wasn't the reason I picked up Garen{{champion:86}} . I played him knowingly that I had certain early advantage cause that was his strength and its up to me to capitalize on that to outsmart and close the game.\n\nSome people might say it takes no skill to play Garen {{champion:86}} in this regard but this is an example.\n\nAs another example, lets take Poppy{{champion:78}} .\n\nLets propose that there \"is\" a rework, and its going to inverse her roles.\n\nShe has GREAT late game cause its what she is known for, but has such terrible terrible early game that the player has to just farm and wait it out.\n\nAssume that the stance for the rework (cause I'm drawing similarities) for poppies rework is that she is too strong of a late game monster (lane bully comparison) so Riot is gonna make her a lane bully for the early game and have poor late game.\n\nAnyone playing Poppy {{champion:78}} as their main and love her, won't like this rework. Because its not the reason why they love the champion in the first place.\n\nThe contrast is the same, Inversing the way a champion is played through a rework is uncalled for. Be it Garen{{champion:86}} , Poppy{{champion:78}} , Or even a Cassiopeia{{champion:69}}  player and that is what this rework has done.\n\nIf being a lane bully was SUCH a problem (which I highly doubt given the track record of the past season), it could have been achieved through number tweaks, lowered early base damages, lowered early scalings etc.\n\nInstead we're given a knee jerk rework with a inversed time space of how the champion excelled at.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2014-11-21T02:40:12.001+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly.  If they want Cass to be a \"spam E\" champ now... that blows.   I hate that kind of playstyle, but that's what they seem to want her to do.  So why not scrap her Q ENTIRELY and make her a new one.  Because right now ALL they do is give her passive stacks and let her spam E.  It's like playing an adc and having to land a karthas Q sized skillshot or your auto attacks won't work.  Her W never did much damage and was mostly a slow and a zoning tool.  Her Q feels terrible now and there's very little use for it, so why keep it what it was?  It used to be her primary poking tool.  Now that she can't really poke with it, change it to something else that can grant her stacks of her lame new passive and maybe she won't feel so freakin terrible to lane as anymore.\n\nI dunno if I'd pick her up again though.  She plays like a really weak, overly complicated ADC who just happens to scale on AP instead.  If I wanna play someone who plays like that, I'll just play an actual ADC and have a better kit for it, along with more pushing power.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Canastus","date":"2014-11-21T20:12:37.968+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"I really wish CertainlyT would have been in charge of this rework, at least she'd have a free gapcloser, reliable point & click cc and no horrendous mana issues then.

She'd be an entirely different champion. \n\nYou're one of the most vocal Cass 'mains' here.... why would you want her changed so significantly that she wouldn't even be similar to her past self? You might as well be asking for a new champion. So many people are pissed that they even touched the values of her current abilities that I can't imagine it'd be much better if they straight up changed how she plays completely. Ginga, probably the 2nd most vocal person to post in these threads thinks that the little adjustments done to her abilities that simply shift her power into late game/single-target dps went too far and may as well have been worked into a new champion and here you are claiming that Cass needs a free gapcloser/point click CC to be relevant. She's literally the same champion she's always been - her abilities haven't even changed. I don't even think it's worth calling this a \"rework\". It's just a gameplay update that gives Cass something to excel in.\n\nShe's not bad right now and you seem to be the only person who is still having significant trouble finding success in the rework. Whether it is 'fun' or not is your opinion, but she's entirely fine in this meta. These tweaks going up on PBE are all she needs to be in a good spot. ","replies":[]}]}]}
