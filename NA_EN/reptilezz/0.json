I'm not sure if it has always been like this and I only noticed it now, but it seems that it only works if 'Character Quality' is set to 'Medium' or higher.\nWould be nice if someone could clarify if this is the intended behaviour. If it is, it probably wouldn't cause so much confusion if the option would automatically be disabled (and grayed out) when the lower character quality options were selected.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-06-06T18:43:59.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First, your client sounds like its losing connection to the Server. This issue is easily fixed by running through the [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743)!\n\nSecond, if you let me know the Summoner name and Region of your second account I can sync it up so that you're able to post on the boards!","replies":[]}]}
