I run speedtests and I have 120 Download &amp; 20 Upload so thought maybe the 5G connection was just not that great but when I play other games such as Overwatch, Rainbow Six Siege and more they run perfectly fine. I get no packet loss and I do not lag at all, it says I have a perfect connection. I feel this has to be on Leagues end or something that League has that is not working with what I have. I am not sure and was hoping somebody could help me find a solution.","replies":[{"poster":"JoHnNyZSoLdjE","date":"2018-02-05T17:15:32.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm experiencing the exact same thing. It's extremely frustrating because my connection is fine and I have tried everything. Only thing that seems to help it is disconnecting and reconnecting to the game which leaves me behind. I feel like I have to quit this game because I can't figure out what is wrong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2018-01-05T03:52:28.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There very well may be some kind of interference or something on either of our ends not cooperating with the other. We do have some steps to try out though. First, always gotta say it, I highly suggest being on a hard line connection. It will always be preferable to Wifi, so do it if you can!\n\nOne thing I want to make sure of is that you have no firewall or AV that is not ok with LoL. Sometimes firewalls will filter or block files from LoL, and that will cause connections to go wonky. To counter that, you can temporarily disable your firewall and test your connection in games, or manually white list LoL. We have a guide that can help direct you to steps to do that [**over here**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3), so check it out. Let me know if this helps out; if not, we can rule out the possibility and move on to other ideas. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordofEntropy","date":"2018-01-03T06:30:10.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I've had the same issue for a few months. Everything else is fine, I can stream 4k video just fine. Other latency important games like ME3, MEA, PUBG, Fortnite, and etc, have no issues whatsoever. I've had the same provider and connection for over 2 years and never had issues until a few months ago with League. Now I'll be at 50 to 70ms, and it spikes every 20 to 30 seconds. If it's an okay day on league it only spikes to 170 or 200, enough to cause a noticeable lag and rubberband type effect. On bad days I've seen it go as high as 7600 ms. I've done full repair, updated my net drivers, given League a free pass through firewalls and everything. \n\nIt does feel like League isn't working with \"something\" as well as it used to. While I imagine it's not necessarily a server side sort of thing (otherwise everyone would be affected) it feels like there are some configurations on the client side where League isn't playing as nice anymore. Because it used to be fine, all my other stuff works just fine, and I'm a pretty good troubleshooter and haven't been able to nail a solution down yet.\n\nOn another note, why does League have so many concurrent connections at a time:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/hsv4NCo\n\n","replies":[]}]}
