Most of my friends haven't played it.\n\nAnyways, Survival Chaos is a 4 player FFA on a square where each player has base at the middle of each of the sides. The bases send out troops down the middle lane to the center, where everyone clashes, and down each side of the base where the troops will clash along the edges of the square with the adjacent base. Everyone gets a different race and a different special bonus specific to the race at the beginning, and then everyone fights. When your troops kill other troops you get money, which you can use to spend on researches for the units, upgrading your buildings, buying units/heroes, and researching abilities. It's a really cool map.","replies":[{"poster":"Brascus","date":"2017-05-25T22:26:38.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this sounds like legit fun \n\nhttp://imgur.com/aMZvjot.gif?noredirect\n\nI miss command and conquer tiberian sun campain, and red alert, god thinking about building the bases with my turrents and walls, war never looked so pretty","replies":[{"poster":"Aeszarck","date":"2017-05-26T00:26:03.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Brascus,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=LFLGtrys,comment-id=0010000000000000,timestamp=2017-05-25T22:26:38.926+0000)\n>\n> this sounds like legit fun \n> \n> http://imgur.com/aMZvjot.gif?noredirect\n> \n> I miss command and conquer tiberian sun campain, and red alert, god thinking about building the bases with my turrents and walls, war never looked so pretty\n\nWell guess what, there were a couple Command and Conquer maps made for Warcraft III, as well as a super high quality Red Alert series by a well-known mapmaker. :D","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Danjeng","date":"2017-05-25T21:48:27.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like it if minions got their own gold from killing enemy minions and towers.

If you purchase a Bouncer, be sure to capitalise on any grapples they get buy attacking the immobile enemy. Kills from the Bouncer give cash to the player who bought it._\n\n_JackBot XL: The JackBot XL is the largest bot SMNC has to offer, it has extremely hard hitting cannons on both hands and it can ground slam when an enemy Pro approaches. It has a humongous health pool and can take alot of punishment. However, they can be grappled and teamwork will easily take a Jackbot down, wasting your $4000. Thankfully, if a Jackbot is escorted, preferably by a Support to heal it, and a Cheston to use Bananas to break grapples on it, it can take down a turret or two before it gets taken down._\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whyqXEp4N4c","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chaos Milk Tea","date":"2017-05-25T02:30:03.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Uh\nI'm\nI like game modes where the champions are the focal point.
