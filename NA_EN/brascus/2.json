They're the ones who are mostly affected by it and can't really abuse the creep clipping since they need to move close to attack.\n\nAlso it's not really a code issue, since ghost and Fizz's passive (and that PD passive nobody really knows about) eliminates creepblocking, so it's definitely possible to get rid of it if they wanted to.","replies":[{"poster":"Brascus","date":"2017-05-25T16:14:40.703+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"I meant to not have them box you in, the collisions are fine, it's just when you get trapped and there was no was of anticipating it.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-05-25T18:16:27.039+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"You can't have creep colision without creepblock though.","replies":[{"poster":"Brascus","date":"2017-05-25T18:47:48.025+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"You can't push them out of the way?","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-05-25T20:09:41.511+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's actually a good idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2017-05-26T12:38:31.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would not that mean the same, functionally wise, as being \"ghosted\"? You ignore creepblock regardless, the price is too small.\n\nUnless you make it so the minion does not get pushed if there is no room next to it, so minion walls still block you, but i'd argue that people complain about it regardless","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2017-05-26T18:03:59.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually there are a number of ways games have dealt with this in the past.  Pushing through creeps could slow you down but you have to be in contact with the minion for X amount of time to start pushing it so you don't get slowed randomly when walking near creeps.\n\nYou could also use the jump through tactic as seen in games like stardew valley where pushing against a minion for a certain amount of time jumps you through to the other side.  I feel like this might be a bit abusable and not clear enough/a bit random feeling in League though.\n\nAlso note that we already can push minions around, the issue is that in large groups there are more minions pushing that one back into place and as a champion pushes the minions around their ideal pathing changes.  In fact most creep block is just a loop of pathing one way which shifts a minion to make a faster route the other way.  The champ then backtracks and tries to walk that way but without the champ pushing the minion that other path closes up and they backtrack again to their initial pathing.\n\nSo really we may just need pathing to keep trying to force you through minions instead of trying to path you around when surrounded.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2017-05-26T11:45:32.062+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Fizz and Kassadin are both perma-ghosted laners who have no such capacity for abusing minion hitboxes, despite their relatively small size. Even at the highest level of mastery, laning as them doesn't involve trying to meld with minions in lane, nor was that the case with top lane Hecarim back when he was also perma-ghosted, so I don't think that qualifies as a valid reason to preserve creep block, especially when its impact is otherwise almost purely negative to players.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-05-26T13:53:37.342+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">But maybe removing it for melee champions?
