I fell in love with Aatrox as well back when I was just learning the game, and he felt good to my pre-30 self. However, as I've come to experience more of the game, I realize that his kit is just too binary. If you get ahead, you destroy people. If you fall behind even the slightest, you're pretty much useless no matter what you build. I've tried all kinds of Aatrox builds. Full tank, full damage, mostly tank, mostly damage...the crux of it is, they all work if you're ahead...or don't if you get behind.\n\nI played an Aatrox game this weekend and I absolutely demolished my lane opponent. By the end of the game I was 18/5/16, but we still lost because, while Aatrox has carry potential, his kit often feels as though it's \"win more\". You duel people forever, but as soon as you get CC'ed you're done for. Your only escape is your initiation tool, and even that can be interrupted by a knockup or a stun before you reach your target. If your team is useless and not following up on your engages then Aatrox can't do jack.\n\nTo top this off, Aatrox's only damage late game comes from his autos. It gets to the point where casting a spell mid-fight does nothing but harm you. Look at Xin Zhao or Master Yi for example. Their skills flow very seamlessly with their auto attacks, allowing them to use their utility and not sacrifice any damage. Aatrox cannot do this. Once you get into a fight, you ult and hope that you have enough damage and sustain to live long enough to win.\n\nTo sum it up, I think what Aatrox really needs is something that both makes him less feast-famine, and also allows him to do more than just auto attack people until they die. If Riot can do this, Aatrox will be in a much healthier spot and won't be considered a joke anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"La Barbotte","date":"2016-02-24T03:11:38.432+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"biggest problem on his kit is the Q not making him untargetable or unCCable while jumping, thats his biggest flaw, i hate when i could get a perfect four man knock up engage to be stopped by any cc or my own trundle XD","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2016-02-24T12:54:41.134+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say his E is what feels useless.\nIt has low damage(scales with ap,which you'll rarely build),low range and the slow isn't very powerful either.\n\nIt might be useful early on,but later it doesn't really do much.","replies":[{"poster":"La Barbotte","date":"2016-02-24T20:32:38.517+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"its your main tool in lane tho, some matchups so need to max this first cause you have to poke them down, and the based stats are good + being magic damage the ennemy wont build MR into aatrox so you still do dmg, and if they do build MR you hurt with everything else, its actually a good spell, just very awkward shape to land","replies":[{"poster":"Ñapoleoni","date":"2016-02-25T00:27:29.346+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with his E is that it has a cast time.

Xin's is less than half a second between when you start and when you hit your target, jax is the same way, Maokai is untargetable during his dash of a slightly shorter but comparable cast time.  Aatrox doesn't need his dash to be uninterruptible, he needs it to be on par with the rest of the champions.  Maybe if his dash was uninterruptible after he hit the peak height and started on his descent, or if it was interruptible throughout but it had a cast time on the order of a Xin E or a Jax Q he'd be balanced, but it's like they don't want him to be competitive.","replies":[{"poster":"Ñapoleoni","date":"2016-02-25T04:02:26.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well his dash is also a knock up so there is a reason it's cast time is so high.","replies":[{"poster":"roar2001","date":"2016-03-07T04:08:51.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is also his only mobility, engage, escape, and meaningful CC.

Nor can he catch an enemy who's out of range. Jax can jump to wards and allies, but must have wards to place or allies nearby. Similarly, Jarvan must have his Demacian Standard up in order to dash. All of these champions have one thing in common with their gap closer: inability to use it in any situation.\n\nAatrox on the other hand can use his gap closer at any moment, to any location.
