I think they could give him a MUCH more interesting ultimate. like the description is cool. a fucking armored bear with lighting coming out of his claws, but then in game the effect is like \"boop\".\n\nHe could just stand to be way cooler. I liken voli to the bears in the golden compass MOVIES(ive read the dark materials series). Looks so fucking cool in the preview, but then you watch it and its fucking mediocre and boring as hell.","replies":[{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2017-05-29T23:02:25.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, i just thought 'Hey this rewards you for playing well and has counterplay therefore kinda good idea'.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Brascus","date":"2017-05-29T19:56:29.148+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The meme's hide the true nature of my agenda","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"An Enemy Sutando","date":"2017-05-29T19:13:23.138+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yay a M&G post in Gameplay.","replies":[{"poster":"Brascus","date":"2017-05-30T05:24:51.675+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Expanding my portfolio.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Supreme Senpai69","date":"2017-05-30T08:22:46.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I don't keep up so I literally thought Voli got buffs until I kept reading lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"needHymn","date":"2017-05-29T19:33:54.360+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-05-31T00:44:15.779+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"if its a double kill he installs dota","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lintu Puck","date":"2017-05-30T05:14:57.425+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually like those changes to Rolling Thunder\n\"I WILL BEAT A MUTHERF@@KER WITH ANOTHER MUTHERF@@KER!!\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"THE RlVER KlNG","date":"2017-05-29T22:29:12.916+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Volibear buffs?\n\nHell yeah.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2017-05-30T03:32:31.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really random off topic thing.\nBut I would love come Volibears VGU, they give him a quote towards Bear Cavalry Sejuani that is\n\"Some just have no pride\"","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2017-05-30T06:21:34.914+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"how about \"I hope your job pays well\"\n\nthere are so many interpretations of that and yet it makes sense ^^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Darth Coffee","date":"2017-05-30T03:14:32.702+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aww man I laughed so hard.\n\n This a great idea for a rotating game mode.
