People who play hypercarry ADCs expect both to 1v5 late game and get insanely fed early game.","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2016-02-03T06:06:55.559+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Used to be different when Kog was around but now....","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2016-02-03T16:34:36.691+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kog mains are peaceful creatures.","replies":[{"poster":"Spaceman5pff","date":"2016-02-03T16:52:38.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just a few games back a mastery 5 Kog told me \"I hope you family dies in a fire\" because I accidentally stepped too far from my lantern when trying to save him :^)\n\nNot sure if Kog main but seemed like a good place to put this.","replies":[{"poster":"Knoyle","date":"2016-02-03T19:46:37.940+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like a Vayne/Riven main trying out Kog","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sageoffire","date":"2016-02-03T02:45:15.738+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh dog!
