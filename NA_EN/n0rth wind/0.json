They do not update for any changes to her AD.**\r\n\r\nI believe, but am unsure, that in some cases they only update when the skills themselves are leveled up but I have not tested that theory. I tried in two separate games before and after the maintenance.\r\n\r\n* In the first game (before the maintenance) I first observed the bug. Her basic skills _seemed _ to update even at level 18, and it was just the R damage boost that never updated (stuck at _+16_) even at 400+ AD. The actual buff seemed to be functioning properly as I was gaining about 80 AD upon activation. The Wind Slash damage bonuses also seemed to respond somewhat, but I did not write the values down to test if they were on par with my AD or they just updated to my AD when I last leveled the skill at 16 and stopped updating after that.\r\n* In the second game I tested against bots during levels 1-3. Here&#039;s what I got:\r\n----------------------\r\n|**Stats at lvl 1:**|\r\n|-\r\n|**AD**:| 91 _(56 + 35)_\r\n|**Passive bonus damage**:| 18.29 _(that&#039;s correct, 20% * 91 = 18.2)_\r\n|**Ultimate bonus AD** (20%):| 16 _(this **should** be equal to the above value -- instead, it&#039;s 20% of **81 **AD, which is my AD when I spawned **before **buying a Long Sword. It did not update when I bought the item)_\r\n|**Ultimate min, max damage**:| 80 (+14) to 240 (+43)\r\n\r\n---\r\nI&#039;m unsure if 10 Edge Wind Slash does the same damage as a max damage _live _ Wind Slash, so I just calculated from the minimum damage which should logically be unchanged.\r\n\r\n|So we have:|\r\n|-\r\n|60% of my bonus AD (**35**) =| **21**|\r\n|60% without item (**25**) =| **15 **_(which is much closer to 14 so apparently it&#039;s also bugged -- it also did not update when my AD increased at lvls 2 and 3)_\r\n------\r\nAlso,  in the second game the **Q bonus damage also did not update**, remaining stuck at _+32_ which is 40% of my AD **before** I bought the Long Sword. Leveling up the ability did not seem to fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-02T17:01:19.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya N0rth Wind! \n\nThanks for the report!
