I tried re-downloading it, but it did not fix the problem. The problem is after locking in, the loading screen with all the players is all glitched out and can't recognize anybody or the background, but is still running. After the loading screen, everything in is distorted and glitched out as well. I need help to fix this problem, please. Thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-03T20:56:48.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When your loading screen is freezing, do you receive any errors?
