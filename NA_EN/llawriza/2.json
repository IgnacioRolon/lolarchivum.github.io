A remake can only occur if the system has marked a player for being *inactive* for 90 or more seconds within the first 3 minutes of the match. If Camille was gone for less than 90 seconds or if they left *after* the 3:00 mark, a remake would *not be available*. Check out our [**/Remake FAQ**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ) for more details on how the system works.\n\nUnfortunately, we are unable to make any sort of modification to your LP, so we can't give you the 14 LP back. The system was designed this way to prevent any sort of potential abuse of the system. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"LlawRiza","date":"2016-12-20T02:47:05.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She left in like 30 seconds and never came back for the entire game...|\nMy team then tried to remake but it says no one has left...\nFunny thing is it even said \"A player has disconnected\"","replies":[{"poster":"Halestormz420","date":"2016-12-20T03:33:06.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a really similar problem recently. Our Akali DC'd 30 or 40 seconds in (not a single CS all game, she just ran to a jungle brush and then dc'd) in a ranked game and remake wouldn't work. She was even marked as DC in the post game screen so idk how we couldn't remake.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
