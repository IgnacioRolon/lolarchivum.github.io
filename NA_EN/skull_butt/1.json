So I pick my champion it was {{champion:98}}. I have supported as him and it can work. But I didn't go support. I went damage and I took kills and I carried the team in team fights. I do plan on doing this again if this situation does come up again. I mean it gives you like a 15 min timer to first pick your champion to show who you are playing.

Aside from the fact that you get zoned in lane by anyone good (cause you're melee), you can't safely kill towers (which is one of the reason why ADCs are needed) and your scaling is questionable at best.

They are more than enough to trash {{champion:157}} in lane and then they can just proceed to win the game for their team (as all of them are snowbally as fuck). {{champion:67}} isn't even top tier pick right now.\n\nBut to be honest, I find it pointless to explain things here.
