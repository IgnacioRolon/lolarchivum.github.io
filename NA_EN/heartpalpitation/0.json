The only restriction that could even occur is restrictions on collecting chests post-game, so you would be able to use hextech crafting without issue.  Your issue is likely being caused by an unstable connection specifically to our services, which can happen regardless of how good your internet is.  You should run through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot and tighten up your network.","replies":[]},{"poster":"oldkingcoal","date":"2017-10-17T08:34:56.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"is it the same issue as this?
