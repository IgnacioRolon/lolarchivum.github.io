It's not even a matter of skillcap, he just isn't viable....at all.\n\n**Winrate don&#039;t mean everything **but extremes like under 40% or over 58-60% (post 5.2 Ahri, Devourer WW) should signal something is wrong.\n\nHe offers little utility (gated behind a long CD and spell requirement), no damage (ridiculously low base numbers, decent scalings) and has weak laning. Like there is no reason to pick him at the moment.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-07-30T12:30:46.921+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, they reworked him and nerfed him because they wanted him to have high risk, high reward. Kassadin has two ranged spells as his main source of damage while his 'High Risk' spells, like his W and R, both do WORSE damage than his Q and E and those two are BARELY able to scratch an AD's negative magic resist.\n\nCurrently, his kit sits at....\n\nQ. 170+70% AP\nW. (The MELEE ability ffs) 140+60%\nE. 180+70% AP\nR. 120 base+2% max mana, going up to (At 800 mana cost per shot) 360+6% max mana. \n\nHis kit has mobility, but it's super gimped. His Riftwalk is okay at 500 range. Riot has been wanting to get every flash ability to be lowered to Flash's range, at 425, which is why Shaco had originally had his Q randomly nerfed completely out of the blue without any complaining about him or him even doing well in S3. It was nerfed from 500 to 400. Kassadin's R is lower than it used to be, but it's still a pretty good gap closer. The downside to it is you have to wait 15s after 2 or 3 uses to be able to use it again because of mana issues. It stacks incredibly quick up to 800 mana and even at 400 mana, it's already chunking away at your mana pool. If they'd just remove the stacks thing since it's not useful anymore. It used to add GOOD damage to him and made a couple quick R's before jumping into a fight worth it, but now the entire point of the stacks is to gate its use. Better off solidifying the CD at 10s and giving it a damn AP ratio and a small boost in base damage. It's one of his 2 HIGH RISK abilities, so why Riot keeps trying to balance his Q and E in his kit when they want him to be HIGH RISK, HIGH REWARD, but never giving his HIGH RISK abilities any kind of use outside of giving him mana or moving himself around is beyond me. \n\nHe needs his Assassination tools fixed so he can actually Assassinate instead of having to use his Q and E for it all like he has since release. I mean ffs. They reworked him to make him more HIGH RISK, but they made his two HIGH RISK abilities near worthless damage-wise and kept his power in his SAFE RANGED abilities. >>","replies":[]},{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2015-07-30T11:36:23.473+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"every time he gets a little love, he jumps from 40% win rate to 90% ban rate. thats not gonna change as long as he has that ult.","replies":[{"poster":"Spicy Rice","date":"2015-07-31T04:32:25.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yet kalista can get a flash every auto\nRiven exists\nAnd graves cant have a cigar","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2015-07-31T04:37:37.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Spicy Rice,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ntzyNBL1,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-07-31T04:32:25.209+0000)\n>\n> Yet kalista can get a flash every auto\n> Riven exists\n> And graves cant have a cigar\n\nkallista is a piece of shit to face because of it and was top pick for the same reason. riven is too unrestricted in her mobility and you see people complaining just as much about her.\n\nso yea, a kit thats overloaded with unrestricted mobility is almost always a bad idea. especially in combination with range. ult in, pick someone on low hp off with q, flash away over a wall with ult again. repeat until fed enough to carry.\n\nthats kassadins play pattern when hes strong. and its not like he has to bring himself intoa  bad position to kill someone. the q is ranged, so if it doesnt work, just walk a few steps back and ult over a wall.\n\nits exactly the same problem with leblanc.\n\ncompare that with yasuo who has to dash over enemy units, cant dash over the same unit twice within 10 seconds, and has to deal with being carried always the same distance, which can make it hard to control. mobility works for him, because it comes with strings attached. if you position yourself properly, you can corner him into a bad position. that doesnt work with kass and leblanc.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LilxPaprika","date":"2015-07-30T10:42:35.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Come to think of it I could see kass get something similar to GP/ Viktor...
