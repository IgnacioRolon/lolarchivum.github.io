I can't really think of who I'd put Eu's 4th and 5th though. I wasn't watching back in s2 early s3, so who would you say instead of Bjergsen for 4th? I always hear about Ocelote, but I really don't know how great he was in his prime. Nukeduck maybe?","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-05-07T04:43:11.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh definitely, Ocelote the crier, could be on the list as well as Nukeduck.

What I mean by that is that Bjergsen has been playing long enough in NA that he is now considered NA starter, which is why TSM can have Lustboy and Santorin when you're required to have 3 NA native players and only allowed the maximum of 2 foreign players. Lustboy being from Korea, Santorin being from Denmark.\n\nAlex plays as a sub for TDK and since their mid retired I guess technically is starting roster, he also plays for Misfits according to his page on Leaguepedia, but I'm not 100% on how accurate that page is. [(Link Here)](http://lol.gamepedia.com/Alex_Ich)\n\nI also fully concur with your assessment of the NA list. I wouldn't consider Link or Pobelter to be anywhere near an all time great, and frankly while Shiphtur has displayed strong play, being on Dignitas he's likely to never get the chance to shine as well as Bjergsen or Hai. \n\nAs far as mancloud goes, I'm not sure that I'd throw him on there any longer due to his recent lackluster performance on Coast, not entirely his fault, as that whole team was so far in the gutter there was basically no coming back. I found myself rooting for them in several of their games just because they needed a win so desperately.\n\nI think my revised list would be as follows:\n\n1. Bjergsen\n2. Hai\n3. Reginald\n4. Scarra\n5. XiaoweiXiao (He also counts as a North American player for roster purposes.)\n\nIt's actually very depressing to look at this list and see that 2 are retired. 1 is sitting around drifting between coaching and other things. and the other 2 are foreign recruited talent.","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-05-06T19:48:29.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People were grandfathered into NA roster lines when the two foreign players was implemented, but it goes back to what I said: \n\n>...but I think he's saying where they are from and not who they play for.\n\nThis posts primary focus to isolate which region produces the \"best\" midlane talent. Which is ridiculous because the \"best\" midlaner in EU is from Korea.\n\nAlex plays for Misfits. He subbed for TDK because their midlaner just up and left them with little to no notice before the placement matches. He isn't going to be on their starting roster as he stated he wants to stay with Misfits.\n\nNext, it is disappointing, but NA is a breeding ground of Jungler talent. Meteos, Xsmithie, Iwilldominate, etc. So don't be disappointed!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"theragingnerd","date":"2015-05-06T12:22:55.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it should be double bjergsen","replies":[]}]}
