This is not a problem with Zed perse but a lot of AP mages being very poor at the moment ({{champion:103}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:63}} still seem very strong) because they reach power-spikes slower and items like {{item:3157}} are far too expensive and offer much less then in earlier seasons.\r\n\r\nThe upcoming AD assassin item is also I feel is a poor idea as it may push him into the OP territory, not because of the passive really but the movement speed makes him stick to targets easier. Without this item I think he has well defined strengths and weaknesses.\r\n\r\nHis laning phase is definitely strong but it needs to be because without snowballing he isn&#039;t going to be useful later on. His teamfighting is belong average, especially into comp with lots of CC/peel and if he isn&#039;t strong his split-push is useless too which would make him a liability. What some people fail to understand is he should beat squishy mages in lane, that&#039;s normal for a 1v1 assassin against an AOE/teamfighting mage. Get a early Seekers before going Mana Regen (Frostfang is cheap and offers 100% mana regen), take Exhaust and you&#039;ll have a smoother laning phase and wait until you outscale.\r\n\r\nIf you want to beat a Zed in lane, options like {{champion:131}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:127}} do quite well against him and are stronger lategame too. Lulu only when paired with a good AD though.\r\n\r\n**tl;dr\r\n-&gt; Zed is in a good spot currently.\r\n-&gt; Assassin item is a bad idea and will likely make him overpowered.\r\n-&gt; AP items suck dick at the moment apart from {{item:3001}} {{item:3027}}\r\n-&gt; Get early {{item:3191}} and {{summoner:3}} and play safer if you are a squishy mage. Malphite will easily 1v1 an ADC, Zed will easily 1v1 a mage.
