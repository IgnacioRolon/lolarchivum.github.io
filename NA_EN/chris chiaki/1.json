First off riot made zed to have a strong early game ( and if you look at it zeds Q does not do a lot of dmg early)  so that he could have a strong mid game and than fall off. Katarina has a decent early game while a deity like mid/late game.  Katrina is the best team fighter in the game in solo q. Zed has near the worst team fight in the game with no survivability ones in the mist.   Also you seem to think zed has 2 gap closers. Let me say this too you so that you understand his kit.  Zed has 3 gap closers. {{summoner:4}}  and his rest. But here's the part where zed has a \"safe gap closer\". If zed uses his w to gap close to you. He no longer  can activate that and risks it all. His cd is much longer than katas and does NOT REFRESH ON KILL.  His ultimate yes is safer than his w. its a great gap closer and does decent dmg to a single squishy champion( lets be honest he's not going to be using his combo on anyone else besides the one he proced with ult). Kata does aoe dmg on...( GUESS WHAT. All her kit excluding gap closer) . So yes zed can make adcs/mids who aren't tanky or don't buy qss ( qss does not block 50% of katas dmg like it does on zed) .               Note also that katas gap closer is both farther, deals dmg, givers her tankyness, resets, and has a lower cd.

Add to that the fact that her QWE, while relatively low damage, can be delivered in the amount of time most champions need to just cast a single ability in their rotation, and yeah, it's easy to see why she's disliked.

Katarina doesn't need super strong waveclear because, like Zed, she can simply cast her abilities on waves whenever she wants while most mages have to be conservative with their own spells. Zeds waveclear also isn't actually that strong (his W Q E is NOT going to be destroying waves instantly for quite some time in the game), it's just that he will ALWAYS be able to use his spells on minions. Really, 90% of mages actually have better waveclear than both Zed and Kat, they just can't afford to use it most of the time, unless they're Xerath or Lissandra. Zed does NOT have \"amazing waveclear\", he just has \"free\" waveclear. This is pretty much best demonstrated by the fact that both Zed and Kat saw a massive surge in play following the mana regen changes.\n\nThey are both difficult to gank in lane (Zed just Ws away, Kat just shunpos to a ward or minion), and Kat even gets damage reduction from her E as well as movespeed from her W for better escaping.\n\nReally, the main difference is that Kat is somewhat riskier because 3 of her spells are melee range and that her in n' out requires a kill or assist, but if a Kat player ever initiates a dive or some risky maneuver and fails to get the kill, that's mostly just a miscalculation of damage on her part. It's pretty much impossible to outplay Kat's QWE, because it's a targeted, effectively instantaneous combo. \n\nI didn't say Kat and Zed were effectively the same champion.

He can W out as long as it's not on cooldown. Kat needs something to jump to, so either a ward or a unit, meaning she sacrifices vision control or you timed your gank poorly.\n\nKat's harass is pretty weak if all she does is Q you, plus it pushes the wave. Zed can control how much he pushes the wave.\n\nZed can dive you with a lot more safety than Kat thanks to the insane safety his R shadow gives you. Honestly, if Kat tower dives you and you die, you were hanging around with very low HP and you screwed up. Her burst is way lower than Zed's.\n\nKat's W deals less damage than a basic attack for most of the laning phase... It's really not that great at farming. Her only way of pushing a wave forces her to get into melee range of the creeps to detonate her Q mark. Zed can do that while staying at a safe distance.\n\nZed doesn't split push because he can't team fight. He split pushes because he can split push. He's extremely deadly in 1v1 situations and will force you to send one of your members to stop him. More than likely, stopping him actually means slowing him down, otherwise you risk dying to him and having your team lose an objective because they're fighting 4v5.

Zed's escape has a longer cooldown, but he can use it whichever direction he wants, and can also use it to juke by throwing shadow one way while running the other way.\n\n* Zed's poke is more reliable and longer ranged. His poke can consist of a full W>E>Q combo, allowing for harder poke and also the possibility of hitting twice, just Q, W>Q, or W>E. Zed can poke from 900-1400 range, where Kat has to be within 675 range for her harass, or has to rely on lucky bounces for anything further.\n\n* Zed and Kat can both dive pretty well, but Zed has a *guarnteed* escape and Kat does not, as per my first point.\n\n* Both can farm well, yes.\n\n* Kat has better teamfighting when considering only the ability to burst multiple people, but is less guaranteed a kill unless somebody else helps her get her resets going (or she is already *very* fed), however, Zed has substantially better target selection and 100-0 burst on a single primary target. His DPS is also pretty good which means he is by no means *bad* at team fighting, just not ideal.\n\nBasically, they are comparable in their role, but that is about it. Kat doesn't have near as good a time farming under tower, Zed is half as likely to get pentakills in teamfights, Zed is safer, Kat snowballs harder, one has no resource, the other only has a resource if you are bad at playing them, etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Potato Doc","date":"2015-03-21T19:23:11.179+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a correction for you, \nKat's Q doesnt take half of her resource bar, it takes all of it.

Kat usually Shunpos in, while Zed has two ways to get in (W and R)... also, once Kat is in, she's stuck in unless and until she gets a kill. There's no half-assing it, realizing you messed up, and then pressing the panic button to get away. Also, while Kat has the potential to deal a ton more damage with her ult, it can also be shut down very early if CCed. Zed's ult still gives him 6 seconds to do damage even if CCed, and then press R, and /laugh away.","replies":[{"poster":"Guy Fox Teemo","date":"2015-03-21T21:07:25.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"See she doesn't half to get a kill she just has to get an assist, in a team fight generally thers ONE person who dies extremlly fast on either team. and thats enough for kat to shunpo AGAIN if she needs to, and it resets her abilites and lowers her ult's cd. And dont give me that shit about her ult being CC'd. I fyou play Katarina correctly you dont just freaking engage the moment the fight starts thats stupid any champion would be cc'd and screwed. You wait lik 2-3 seconds then go in and I doubt many of them have their cc abilites up and then you just clean up the fight because you have resets.","replies":[{"poster":"Kitten of Evil","date":"2015-03-21T22:38:16.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> See she doesn't half to get a kill she just has to get an assist\n\nWell, they've attempted to fix that. Assists aren't enough now. She has to deal damage to the target within the last 3 seconds. Maybe it still needs adjustment, but resets are the only escape mechanism she has. They were looking at a change on the PBE that gave it a cooldown refund if she used it to blink to a champion, but they scrapped that.\n\n> You wait lik 2-3 seconds then go in and I doubt many of them have their cc abilites up\n\nThen they were not playing well. Save at least one CC move for the assassin or burst damage dealer. For example, I was recently playing as TF and the enemy Vi ALWAYS saved her ult for me, even in teamfights where I always waited for Zac and Thresh to engage before following-up. That's smart playing on Vi's part -- people just assume CC spells will be used immediately, so if you save one for later, you can shut down Kat.\n\nThe problem is Kat destroys uncoordinated teams, which means she dominates solo queue at low levels... but against any coordinated team, she has a really hard time using her ult.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-03-21T12:30:59.981+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"Problem stems from that Zed gets a out of jail card when he engages as a default, doesn't matter if he succeeded or not, while Kat has to kill somebody to get that. \n\nAnd she is vulnerable during her burst unless she is so fed she kills everybody the instant she presses R but that's only natural on fed individuals, she only has 1 spell dedicated to both engage and disengage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kàtariná","date":"2015-03-21T10:57:32.544+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"katorina op gg","replies":[]},{"poster":"DJ Hatsune Miku","date":"2015-03-21T18:19:38.770+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Kat has one of the weakest laning phases in the game, has poor base damages, and minimal burst early game.
