I don't like it or agree with it though, since taking her into the jungle is something I was really looking forward to being able to do with her personally, and considering the number of vocal people that this targeted nerf has made its way into a recognized issue with the community. Considering that it is fair to say that the devs are actually against against the community in this matter to be honest.\n\nAgain I can understand the concerns about jungle outperforming solo lane for irelia, before her clears were really not bad although not top of the food chain for that point but her ganks had the opportunity to be the point that really caused jungle to outshine lane. This isn't just a objective analysis but also comes from experience of being able to play on the PBE. The changes slowed down the clears which alone would have been a good way to tone down the ganks but the clears are now also quite drastically less healthy (just barely better than live irelia so pretty bad). I have made this point of suggestion time and time again about her healing needs to scale better for someone who's core items, because it feels increasingly less appreciated as she gets more items. \n\n**WHEN** it shows that the jungle nerfs went to far, but I'm sure you wont want to up her clear speed further increase the health of her clears through the Q healing. Assuming solo lane she'll be fine increase the heal on monsters by X%, her early jungle is healthier the clear speed is still toned down. If there is the possibility of her needing a buff all around, make the heal increase by X% for every Y% missing health, it would address the above concerns about it feeling less appreciated as she builds up, her damage is fine and frankly is in no need of buffs in my opinion. Considering the timing left it may be possible to implement the jungle specific consideration before last lock ins.

Just isn't her primarly role, and that's ok. RiotRepertoir made valid points, they know that reworking a champion implies on keep their essence and playstyle. Now I ask you, which large rework (I said large, VGU, relaunch) changed the role of a champion? Let's take a look at the lastest reworks?\n\n* Poppy\n* Taric\n* Ryze\n* Yorick\n* Warwick\n* Galio\n* Urgot\n* Evelynn\n* Swain\n\nNone of them changed the role of this champions, even the Poppy jungle and Warwick top that were used rarely before still be used sometimes today. Urgot was used as ADC back in Season 2, but after that, he changed to solo laner and this became his main role.\n\nGraves isn't a valid argument, because he was reworked in a different kind of project, and Riot had already said that this \"Classes Reworks\" didn't hit the mark. They even reverted Kog, Rengar and now Leblanc.\n\nSo, stop complaining guys, she still can jungling as much as the current Irelia can (even better IMO). This is not a new champion like Repertoir said, it's a rework and they can't just make her jungle potential outshine her solo lane performance.","replies":[{"poster":"Raxistaicho","date":"2018-03-28T22:11:54.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RenanRein,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PZqcBcTg,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2018-03-28T14:43:48.276+0000)\n>\n> Why are people so pissed about this?
