Unless you&#039;re playing in Bronze the enemy team probably wont let that happen. Its only use now is healing a smidge on your lane opponent to try and save potions. Hell, you&#039;d probably be better off just starting corruption potion anyway.  Maybe just remove the heal and buff his defense or HP/HP regen?","replies":[{"poster":"Ch√∏nklord","date":"2017-05-21T10:43:06.037+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a darius main with _all the darius skins (yes, even the $400 dreadnova)_ and mastery 7, I can safely say **you know nothing, ~~jon snow~~** yung padawan.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-05-21T04:33:50.723+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can see his HP rise in an annoyingly large chunk every time he hits it laning.

Not to mention that sustain used to be his only exploitable weakness as a pure melee laner against him. Now even that's off the table.","replies":[]}]}
