Yorick's on sale tomorrow as well, but I thought he was on that \"no promotion until rework\" list (which is why he's not on the free week promotion, why Riot never bothered to make a skin in over four years and four months, and why some Riot employees poop all over Yorick players at every opportunity.)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2015-10-20T02:45:33.554+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sales are announced Monday and Thursday, but start on Tuesday/Friday.","replies":[]}]}
