If you compare his ratios to Lee Sin, Talon, or Riven, with multiple abilities in the 90-100s range, you see his ad ratio's are actually a bit less than average; the %bonus AD increase only serves to bring those ratios up to be on par with other AD caster type champions so, 125% bonus AD on his Q, and 100% bonus AD on his E, both of which are totally reasonable being AD scaling ratios, since he has only 2 direct damage abilities.
