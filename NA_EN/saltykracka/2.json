Jayce, Gnar, Heimer, Mundo, Darius, Teemo, Quinn... see the pattern? Anyone who can blind, keep her at range, go all in with overpowering damage, or any combination, can easily deal with Fiora. She's not as broken as people like to make her out to be. Is she strong? Definitely. Is she without counterplay? Not at all.

QSS and Zhonya's are not options that are good on a lot of people, and Zhonya's is probably a poor choice against Fiora anyway (unless you are in a teamfight situation and you are an APC).  Outside of QSS there is no items that are good against her aside from maybe Rylai's, Randuin's and Twin Shadows because slows are always nice.\n\nThere is some counterplay to her.  Do I think that there are a lot of champs that can't take advantage of said counterplay?  Yes.
