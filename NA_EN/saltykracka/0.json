Comments? Promises not to let him be shoved into the dumpster for no reason?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scruffy","date":"2015-08-11T05:10:25.754+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that he's in a pretty balanced spot right now. After 5.16, it's not super clear how that will change (new items and a bunch of reworks could shake things up a lot). My guess is it'll be about even with frozen heart nerf (hurts nasus) and Steraks Gage (+ base AD good for nasus/sheen users).\n\nThat said, the live balance team, the systems team, and the champ update team are all watching the results very closely so we can follow up where it's needed.","replies":[{"poster":"Fadedpf","date":"2015-08-11T05:22:31.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you guys considered the chance of these armor nerfs hitting harder than intended and resulting in some reverts/buffs if needed if tanks and fighters are in a bad spot after armor being hit? Mainly because armor counters already exist and the increased price will leave you just that more behind if you are in real need of defensive items.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scruffy","date":"2015-08-11T05:48:57.698+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Absolutely, I think that there is no crusade against tanks/fighters that i've heard of and the general fear is that they will end up too strong after 5.16.

As a character with a health steroid (in R) and sustain that relies entirely on his innate regeration and lifesteal from Q, he wants items that give him pure defensive stats instead of health. And seeing as FH, Thornmail, and Randuins are being gutted...","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scruffy","date":"2015-08-11T05:47:27.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, the main issue as you say for nasus is that health items really don't fit as well into his ideal builds.
