Could not connect to the http server\". We are in different parts of town and can access any other site or game we have. Is there possibly a local issue with our service provider or is Riot struggling with AK? Thoughts and or Fix suggestions? I checked out what other users had done to correct their issues when approached with the same connectivity problems and none of them worked. I didn't see any other local posts about this. So in full scope any computer in my household gets the aforementioned quotes and my friends computer.","replies":[{"poster":"Goddess Of Night","date":"2015-01-11T23:34:50.317+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"My husband and I are in North Pole, AK and we are having the same problem.
