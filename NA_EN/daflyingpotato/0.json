When you opened up the patcher, did you select launch legacy client on the bottom of the Sign In button?  \n\nYou might have a firewall or setting that is preventing your update from going through.  I recommend using the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to auto-configure your firewall just in case.  Then use our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure that access hasn't suddenly changed and allowing game files to be accessed.
