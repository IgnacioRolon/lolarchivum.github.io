Anyway i&#039;m unemployed and so i spend my time doing various athletic &#039;things&#039; mixed with league games. and yes i have a extremely high reaction speed and muscle memory capability. \r\n\r\n i&#039;m honestly still salty about my faulty ban and i&#039;m gonna do anything i can - there&#039;s a lot i can xD! to make sure riot pays for it. not just the accounts value but wasted time if i can get that too.","replies":[{"poster":"xXxAltaïrrxXx","date":"2016-08-19T12:48:14.913+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, u clearly have \"high reaction speed and muscle memory capability\" and ur team is always holding u back.Thats why u are silver 5.Get real XD.","replies":[{"poster":"260fox","date":"2016-08-19T12:52:10.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"uh oh i got gold without even playing near my best for fear of getting banned for playing the best i can O:","replies":[{"poster":"xXxAltaïrrxXx","date":"2016-08-19T13:00:41.742+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats doesnt make any sense at all.Rito would not ban u for ur \"high reaction speed and muscle memory\", u were using scripts.\n\nEdit:For the sake of clarity, what athletic\" things were u doing?I am curious because u seem like a huge troll.","replies":[{"poster":"Mobility Power","date":"2016-08-19T13:31:16.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i'm able to achieve a high amount of checks that usually aren't possible i considered going pro golds not my best anyways, on a side note - to answer your question i do a variety of martial arts i dance and run a lot i do some collision avoidance things using others around me to test probability and other things i study philosophy - all religions - and science with a very open point of view,  among a huge amount of other things i can't list or this is gonna be another post in itself. most of the time i feel like i'm actually playing bad comparatively to what i could do so i hardly play on any accounts higher rank just bloat up my low accounts w/ trolly games that i win a lot of too which is funny in itself. which is why i average a huge amount of deaths just feeding and wining anyways. \n\ntldr; dunno what even to tldr; sorry.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2016-08-19T14:10:28.526+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, you'd need to show what software you installed on your computer that is uncommon enough that very few people have it that could possibly trigger the system.

I guess it comes down to what type of  dollar amounts i could get in court vs the enjoyment of getting my account back anyways.  if i filed a whistle blower lawsuit that covered lost damages to not only mine but probably several others accounts riot as a company may not be able to pay for the damages actually or may try to settle especially if i do a lab study. for several reasons- hours wasted on minimum $ sentence is still  x 8000 and not just for me either so x 1000s of others -  then they gotta deal w/ the headaches of boards blowup, ticket blowup, not to mention lost court fee's and hours iv been robbed of the merchandise i bought which is months x the $ amount i spent which is hundreds of rito points..... it would be more $ then our player-base depending on what the minimum sentences are because the court would probably only minimum sentence to avoid me basically getting more money then riot has.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-08-19T19:48:39.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mobility Power,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=tOqdwmrY,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-08-19T14:04:47.348+0000)\n>\n> and hours iv been robbed of the merchandise i bought which is months x the $ amount i spent which is hundreds of rito points.....\n\nJust so you know, you didn't buy any merchandise from riot games, you rented it. I would suggest reading the terms and conditions you agreed to before trying to take anyone to court (specifically section 4.3 in this case). You also agreed that your account could be denied service at any time (they list some specifics that basically cover any situation), and also through the use of automated detection services (section 2.1.2).\n\nIf you think you have found a way to falsely trigger any of their detection software I would suggest submitting a ticket with the information you (think you) have. They probably wont give you any information regarding it as that would possibly make it easier for others to avoid being caught, but it may help.\n\nAlso, I will go ahead and say that, although I have no proof, I am very sure that you cannot cause their automated systems into banning you by having high reflexes. If you could then professional players would be getting banned as basically all they do is practice the game and reflexes are part of that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Horse Grenades","date":"2016-08-19T16:26:46.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This guy seems like the douche from Sausage Party","replies":[]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2016-08-19T13:06:12.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok","replies":[]}]}
