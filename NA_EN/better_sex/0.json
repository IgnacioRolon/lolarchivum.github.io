I dont care if you broke your leg, got arrested, or died. You either inform the team of your absence, or it will be counted as a strike, and as usual, 3 strikes. Youre out.\n-Follow instructions... Here&#039;s a test. Hopefully youve read this far, and if you have, youll know to include your favorite pizza topping into your application.\n-We&#039;re adults, we have a sense of humor, as expected per the nature of the team. But, lets not be disrespectful or rude. (theres a thin line there... youll figure it out I&#039;m sure.)\n\nThe more refined ruleset will be sent to you once you have been chosen to be on the team.\n\nBasic Requirements:\n-Be at least 18 years of age\n-Be at least G2 or higher this season\n-Have voice comms, preferrably discord or curse until we get a teamspeak server here in a few weeks. You are expected to not only have these programs ready to go, but also have the ability to Speak, and Hear on said programs. (So have a mic, and/or headset in order to effectively communicate)\n-Be able to take criticism\n-Adhere to schedule set by coaches in agreement with team and captains\n-You must play at least 3 champions well in the role youre applying for, or don&#039;t apply.\n-You must speak clear english\n-You must be able to commit to the team and schedule\n\nOkay,\nSo. Those are the basics. The rest will be dealt with more in depth later as we finalize the rosters and create the final product as far as the whole organization goes.\nNow,\nApplication process.\nSo, first off. DO NOT ADD ME IN GAME. Fill out the application here. Apply for one role, your main role, or role you would like to main. And i will add you in game if i feel you might be a fit for us. \nOnce we have a list of players chosen for try outs, we will conduct a round of try outs.\nTryouts will be taken seriously, as every aspect of your gameplay will be analyzed over the course of 5 games per applicant.\nI will not only be looking at actual skill level, but also your synergy with the rest of the team. So if youre boring, or don&#039;t communicate, you may not make the cut.\nOnce try outs have been taken care of, we will determine who best fits the needs of the team, and extend an official offer to join said teams.\nNow remember, we are looking to fill 2 teams. Team 1 will obviously be the bread and butter. Team 2, will serve as not only a list of subs, but also as a practice partner. Team two, will still receive most of the same benefits offered to team 1. For example if team 1 enters a tournament and we are able to enter team 2, both teams will be entered. Team 2 will have a coach just like team 1. So don&#039;t be discouraged if you make team 2 and not team 1. Players from both teams may be switched around during the season to gain Wins.\n\nThis is going to be a long process, but i will do everything in my power to make sure its worth it for those of us who have a passion for competitive league of legends.\n\nNow that everything has been pretty much covered, here is your application. Again, DO NOT ADD ME IN GAME, I WILL ADD YOU ONCE I HAVE PROCESSED YOUR INITIAL APPLICATION HERE.\n\nApplication:\n\nIGN:\nAge:\nRole:\nRank (Current and Highest):\nChampion Pool:\nCompetitive LoL XP:\nTimezone:\nFavorite Movie:\nFavorite Song:\nAvailability:\nWilling to travel (Y/N):\nWhat is your favorite non-meta pick:\nWhat is your biggest strength in game:\nWhat is your biggest weakness in game:\nWhat happens to you when you tilt:\nHow comfortable are you shotcalling:\nDo you have any tournament experience:\nDo you prefer chocolate or vanilla:\nWhen you shit, do you read random things around you?:\nWhat&#039;s your favorite color:\nHow long have you played LoL:\nHow much do you play on average a week:\nWhy are you interested in IGH:\nWhat do you feel you bring to the table that no one else can:\nAre you thuggin:\nWhats your favorite bad word:\nFavorite pornstar:\nFavorite beer:\nCan you be a good wingman:\nWhat is your goal this season:\nWhat is your preferred voice comms:\nHow hard do you league:\nBlunts bongs or dabs?:\nDo you like kids?:\nCan you body these fools:\nRandom shit you&#039;d like to say or mention:\n\nIf you&#039;ve made it this far, I applaud you.\nI will be looking forward to your responses and congratulations in advance to whoever makes it past the BOARDS ;D\n\n-Thanks,\nIGH Infinite","replies":[{"poster":"DungeonBossVeig","date":"2016-08-12T01:36:09.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: God of tea\nAge:17/18 in march\nRole:mid\nRank (Current and Highest): d5/d5\nChampion Pool: viktor diana azir tf taliyah zilean karma\nCompetitive LoL XP: played with two amateur teams in weekly leagues so about 8 months of it\nTimezone: pst\nFavorite Movie: grandbudapest hotel\nFavorite Song: \nAvailability:3:30 till w/e \nWilling to travel (Y/N):y\nWhat is your favorite non-meta pick:galio\nWhat is your biggest strength in game:\nWhat is your biggest weakness in game:Macro knowledge\nWhat happens to you when you tilt: get quiet\nHow comfortable are you shotcalling: very\nDo you have any tournament experience: used to the online tourny scene and have traveled a few hours a few times for tournys\nDo you prefer chocolate or vanilla: neither strawberry for life.\nWhen you shit, do you read random things around you?: As like walking around and shit yeh, used to reading everything.\nWhat's your favorite color:blue\nHow long have you played LoL:3/4 years? idk since end of s2\nHow much do you play on average a week:everyday unless not able\nWhy are you interested in IGH: very much so, have been looking for a new team to learn and grow with\nWhat do you feel you bring to the table that no one else can: experience and huge potential considering my age and my skill level, also I am able to learn champs quickly.\nAre you thuggin: fuck no thats pussy shit\nWhats your favorite bad word: fuck\nFavorite pornstar:\nFavorite beer: blue moon\nCan you be a good wingman: the best as long as your not fat as fuck\nWhat is your goal this season: d3\nWhat is your preferred voice comms: team speak\nHow hard do you league: When im on a team atleast 4-5 hours a day less so when only solo\nBlunts bongs or dabs?: used to but dont dig it anymore\nDo you like kids?: fuck no\nCan you body these fools: Is that even a question?\nRandom shit you'd like to say or mention: Fuck you, and the traveling isnt a problem parents dont give a fuck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bondball7","date":"2016-08-12T00:42:36.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: Bondball72 (permabanned), Jeroneth\nAge: 32\nRole: Mid/Top\nRank (Current and Highest): I think Jeroneth SI (friends account i took over)...Bondball72 was Plat V last season and GII this season before ban\nChampion Pool: Malphite, xin, nocturne, morgana, nasus, yorick, lux, warwick, garen, yi, pantheon, amumu, cho, sion...I like older non meta champs because fuck single minded meta kids in a game with 130 champs.
