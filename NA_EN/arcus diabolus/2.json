In fact, feel free to apply that to every suggestion in this post. My inner fighting game fanboy wants to feel like I&#039;m fighting for rounds in a fighting game when I walk into lane.\r\n\r\nAlso if you could move the \"HIT!\" effect from her Q hits to successful passive strikes, that would be awesome, both thematically and as a practical purpose: New Riven players can use that effect to better learn how to frame cancel. You could even keep the Q \"Hit!\" but have the passive strikes \"HIT!\" a different color, like red or bright blue. \r\n\r\nLastly, add a combo counter above Riven&#039;s head. Just something that keeps track of the number of abilities and auto attacks she lands on a enemy in a single continuous attack string. This would also be incredible to see.\r\n\r\nPlease, this is a humble request from a fighting game player that would love to feel some love toward the fighting game community.","replies":[]}
