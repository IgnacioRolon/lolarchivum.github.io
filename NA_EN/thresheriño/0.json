Anyway, after LoL All Star Game and LoL World championship i think you can start a new challenge with a world cup like a FIFA World Cup, for me, it's just a dream to see a French national Team or a Swedish Team against Korean Team!

I didn't say there are only 3 countries that play LoL.  I said there are only 3 countries that can (reliably) field 5-man teams that are even remotely competitive to win tournaments.","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-03-09T15:49:24.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> the quantity of LCS action is so small that, only Korea/USA/China have the player pools available to make this work\n\nThis is what you said. Spain (Giants in the EU LCS) has fielded an entire team. I remember Moscow 5's domination which was an entirely Russian team.  Also, I never quoted that you said only those 3 countries play LoL. So please do not mis-quote me.\n\nJust because the 3 regions you mentioned field an extensive number of notable players. Does not mean that other regions cannot field competitive teams. (Quas is from LA, Bjergsen is Dutch, \n\nBut I do agree that entire teams from specific countries may be a bit to enthusiastic at this time, I do like the idea though.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
