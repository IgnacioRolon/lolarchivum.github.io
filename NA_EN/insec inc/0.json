I have tried doing everything from deleting files in lol_air_client to pasting the S_OK file in to every one of the releases folders, however I still get unspecified error during the patching period. Moreover I even tried using a VPN with an IP in Sweden with no real luck. The furthest I have gotten was when  changed to a server in Oceania when there was 1.5gb left to download it just changed to 0 files scanned the percentage went to 99% with it still saying 0 files scanned and left it there like this for good 5 hours, so I guess it just got stuck. I need help.","replies":[{"poster":"insec inc","date":"2017-04-13T22:34:46.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have found a solution, therefore if anyone has the same issue as me I literally tried everything. Answer for me was: \"Uninstalled AVG, complete uninstall\" something in AVG Antivirus was blocking the patching.
