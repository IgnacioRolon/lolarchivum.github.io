A \"what if she wasn't evil\" skin like arclight or justicar would be awesome, too - there's a lot of possibilities for her, and lots of room for new skins.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Supreme Pizza","date":"2015-10-17T03:13:59.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically was Imortal say lol.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TwoD","date":"2015-10-09T23:47:57.152+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"idc what any of you say but {{champion:91}} needs a real new skin","replies":[{"poster":"Supreme Pizza","date":"2015-10-17T03:28:34.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of champions do.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Indrift","date":"2015-10-09T00:51:14.272+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"How could you forget Azir?\nHe's like the new Zac lol","replies":[{"poster":"Supreme Pizza","date":"2015-10-17T03:14:37.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was looking at old champions, not new ones.","replies":[]},{"poster":"filipino4tune","date":"2015-10-09T17:16:15.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly what I thought","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"53436278DEL1","date":"2015-10-09T00:34:29.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:14}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:3}}","replies":[{"poster":"Supreme Pizza","date":"2015-10-17T03:15:05.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saph","date":"2015-10-11T19:56:03.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Justicar Reborn,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=Eq3F7NQl,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-10-09T00:34:29.310+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:14}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:3}}\n\njax just got his Warden skin, Galio got Debonair and Irelia got OotL earlier this year","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"jeremiahBIO","date":"2015-10-14T10:30:20.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"FOR THE LOVE OF GOD RIOT {{champion:18}}.","replies":[]}]}
