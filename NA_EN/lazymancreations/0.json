It keeps asking me to login even though I already am, then just re-directs me back to the page. It's also not working when I want to go to the \"Ask Riot\" page. Same thing happens. \r\nAny ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-27T15:52:39.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your browser may be clogged up so to speak, and needs a little spring cleaning.
