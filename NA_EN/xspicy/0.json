First, let's go through the basics together so we don't miss a beat.\n\n* You can earn up to four chests at a time with a slot being available each week (after opening them).\n* You earn a chest for achieving S-rank on a champion, and you won't be able to earn another with that champion until the end of the season.\n* If someone in your premade group earns an S-rank, you'll receive a chest as well (tied to the champion you're playing--in this case Karma). This counts toward your champion until the end of the season.\n* You can only earn chests if you're playing a champion you own so rented and Free Rotation champions don't count.\n\nFirst, do you have any chest slots open? \nSecond, you didn't earn an S-rank, but someone else on the team did and it sounds like you haven't earned a chest with Karma yet.\nThird, were either players \"somthing\" or \"Kale\" part of your premade group?\nFourth, it looks like you already own Karma because you're playing Order of the Lotus Karma.\nLastly, keep in mind that the chests are sometime slow to be awarded as well.\n\nIf you've met all of those conditions and still have issues, I recommend contacting my colleagues through the [Support Site](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) to see what's going on or if it was awarded late.","replies":[{"poster":"Declined","date":"2016-03-25T21:05:20.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Son Golin,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=K0TncAag,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-03-25T18:15:47.891+0000)\n> \n> I see that you're having trouble with the Hextech Chests when someone on your team is doing super well and getting an S-rank.

In your Champions Page in the PVP.net Client, champions which have already counted toward your earned chest will have a gold border.\n2. Similarly, in your Champions Page in the PVP.net Client, if you hover over your champions, you'll see a chest on the bottom right corner.
