I was recently looking at all the new project skins ( which are all awesome the Leona one is my favorite ) and when I saw Leona&#039;s skin I thought to myself, \"cool she looks like a futuristic knight in shining armor\", but the one thing that bothered me a bit about the skin was the open face helmet she has and that, to me, it looks a bit out of place since she is suppose to be a tank type of character and should be covered complete in armor for full protection, also not being able to see her face would make her look a little more intimidating. So I got curios and went searching around to see what others thought about it and found this post that someone made that altered the look of the skin to give it the full helmet look. \n\nMe personally I like the full helmet look, but it seems that the community is a split with the thought. So I thought maybe add a effect to the skin similar to Rengar&#039;s night hunter skin and make it so that when you press a certain key that a plate would fold down from the helmet to cover her mouth, But that&#039;s just my opinion on the matter and in no way is it that i&#039;m bashing the skin. To me it looks like a cool skin and that i&#039;m going to get it no matter what happens, since I main support and i&#039;v been waiting a long time for a cool full knight armor that&#039;s unique for Leona. Also as a Side note I like the open face design on Fiora&#039;s project skin, It makes her look more Raiden from metal gear solid that way. So ya those are my thoughts and I was wandering what everyone else thought about the open face/full helmet Idea.

Once Leona hit PBE, we noticed that as you mentioned, were pretty torn between her having her face visible versus having it covered. Due to this, we decided to keep the helmet the way it was. \n\nToggles for all of the PROJECT: skins were discussed as well, but ultimately we decided against it because we didn't feel like it was an impactful addition to the skin, and wouldn't harm the skin if they didn't have that feature. Visors are a pretty small aspect of these skins, as compared to Night Hunter Rengar's hood, which is really easy to see from game height.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ionian","date":"2015-09-04T12:29:31.264+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"✓ Create Project Leona\n✓ Create Project Leona without helmet\n✓ Create chromas for Project Leona\n✓ Create chromas for Project Leona without helmet\n\n$$$","replies":[]},{"poster":"333lom","date":"2015-09-05T19:14:13.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope Riot one day changes their mind and gives Project Leona a full helmet. Her voice is even modified, but her mouth is uncovered. It makes no sense! Other than that, the skin is epic, just like a full-armoured high-tech knight.","replies":[]}]}
