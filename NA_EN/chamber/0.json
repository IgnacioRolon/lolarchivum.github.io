I have been saying that I would never play ranked again until Solo Q was back.  \r\n\r\nBut I now see my approach was just misguided and that I am now truly on the right path.  Now that ranked no longer matter in terms of sklll, I can and will play ranked EVERY match and with a IDGAF attitude.  \r\n\r\nNo more practicing champs in normals.  No more trying out troll builds against bots or blind pick.  From now on its Teemo support, Leblanc jungle and Taric top lane with no regrets.\r\n\r\nI used to take ranked seriously.  You know, practice non stop in normals then really step it up for ranked matches.  But now that ranked is one big joke, I don&#039;t have to take it seriously any more.
