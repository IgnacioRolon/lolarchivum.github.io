TONS OF READING BELOW]","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I designed a champion for all of you. My idea originated with Trundle: A champion based around stealing your stats. However, what if we took that a step further? A champion that steals your opponent&rsquo;s mechanics, in a way. This got me thinking.\n\nOriginally, Tennon was an assassin, diving onto squishy targets and not able to do a lick of damage against any target with armor. This didn&rsquo;t make any sense to me looking back on it, so I instead repurposed him into a skirmishing and dueling mage. It makes much more sense, in my book.\n\nThe lore is the most flexible thing about this champion to me. At first he was a villain, attempting to absorb all the power of the world. Then he was a dark soul that had been trapped inside Garen&rsquo;s mind, and was finally released. Eventually, I came to his current lore, which can be read below. I originally thought of this character before the Institute of War became non-canon, so it may seem as though it reads like the old lore. That would be why.\n\nAlso, his base attack range is 325. It is considered ranged, but it is shorter than any other ranged champion. His base attack range is actually the same as Aatrox while his ultimate is active. Anyway, let&rsquo;s get into it.\n\n**_Tennon, the Ripper of Shadows_** [Mage]\n\n**Passive &ndash; Shadow Copy**\nWhenever Tennon gets a kill on an enemy champion he permanently gains a buff depending on the champion he killed. Each champion has a special buff for Tennon that interact with his abilities and auto attacks. \n\nAdditionally, for every 5 takedowns Tennon gets, he gets a random buff of a champion that is NOT in the game he is currently in. This includes champions on the same team as Tennon.\n\n**Q &ndash; Shadow Siphon** (AoE)\nTennon launches an orb at the target location. After a short delay, all enemies in the area take damage and are slowed. For each enemy champion Tennon hits with this ability, he gains a movement speed bonus for a time. Tennon also heals based on the number of targets he hits.\n\n**Cast Range:** 700\n**Damage Radius:** 225\n**Damage:** 60/105/150/195/240 (+0.7 AP)\n**Slow:** 35%\n**Slow Duration:** 2 Seconds\n**Move Speed Bonus:** 15/20/25/30/35%\n**Move Speed Duration:** 4 seconds\n**Heal per enemy:** 4/7/10/13/16 (max 24/42/60/78/96)\n**Cooldown:** 8/7.5/7/6.5/6 seconds\n**Cost:** 60/70/80/90/100 Mana\n\n**Edit:**\n**Missile Speed:** 900 (Slightly faster than Lissandra E)\n**Damage Delay after Travel:** 0.675 seconds\n\n**W &ndash; Shadow Sting** (Auto Attack Modifier)\nPassive: Tennon&rsquo;s auto attacks deal extra magic damage on hit. \nActive: The damage from the passive of this ability is doubled for the next 4 auto attacks. Also, for these attacks, Tennon has increased attack speed and attack range, but the base damage from his auto attacks are reduced.\n\n**Passive Damage:** 20/30/40/50/60 (+0.15 AP)\n**Active Damage:** 40/60/80/100/120 (+0.3 AP)\n**Attack Speed:** 30/40/50/60/70%\n**Attack Range:** 150/175/200/225/250\n**Reduced Base Damage:** 75% damage from Base Auto Damage\n**Max Duration:** 5 seconds\n**Cooldown:**10/9/8/7/6 Seconds after buff ends\n**Cost:** 30/35/40/45/50\n\n**E: Shade Rip** (Enemy Target)\nTennon rips the Shadow from an enemy, dealing either flat or percent max health magic damage, whichever would deal more damage. An enemy who is the target of Shade Rip will temporarily not have their Shadow. This takes time to regenerate. While an enemy&rsquo;s Shadow is regenerating, they take half damage from Shade Rip, but this ability will restore half of its mana cost to Tennon.\n\n**Cast Range:** 550\n**Flat Damage:** 70/120/170/220/270 ~~(+0.75 AP)~~\n**Percent Damage:** 7/7.75/8.5/9.25/10% ~~(+0.75 AP)~~\n**Shadow Regen Time:** 14/13/12/11/10\nCooldown: 9/8/7/6/5 Seconds\nCost: 60 Mana\n\n**Edit:**\n**AP Ratios:** 0.6 AP Ratio on both Flat and Percent damage. \n\n**Ultimate &ndash; The Shadow of Demacia** (Enemy Target)\nTennon engulfs an enemy champion in shadow, dealing magic damage. For a time afterward, Tennon steals AD, AP, Health Regen, Attack Speed, and Movement Speed from the target and deals damage to them. If the target dies while affected by this ability, the cooldown is cut in half.\n\n**Edit:**\n**AP Ratio on both damage paths:** 0.6 AP Ratio\n**Cast Range:** 650\n**Initial Damage:** 100/165/230 (+0.4 AP)\n**Damage per second:** 20/40/60 (+0.1 AP)\n~~**AD and AP Steal:** 30/40/50 (Steals Bonus AD before Base AD)~~\n**Attack Speed Steal:** 30/35/40%\n~~**Move Speed Steal:** 20/30/40%~~\n**Health Regen Steal:** Steals all of the opponents health regen.\n**Cooldown:** 120/100/80 Seconds\n~~**Cost:** 80/95/110 Mana~~\n\n**Edit:**\n**AD and AP Steal:** No longer steals AD or AP\n**Move Speed Steal:** 25% movement speed at all ranks\n**Cost:** 80/90/100 Mana\n\n**_Stats_**     (Base) {Growth per level}\nHealth--------------------------------------(450) {87}\nHealth Regen/5--------------------------(7.7) {0.55}\nMana---------------------------------------(290) {44}\nMana Regen/5---------------------------(5.3) {0.4}\nAttack Speed-----------------------------(0.592) {3.25%}\nMovement Speed-----------------------(340)\nRange--------------------------------------(325)\nArmor---------------------------------------(15.6) {3.2}\nMagic Resistance------------------------(30) {0}\n\n**_Lore_**\nThere is an evil hiding that hadn&rsquo;t been seen before. That is, until the sudden appearance of one man.\n\nTennon was born without any warning. He awoke one day in a dark cave with a large robe with no memory of who he was or what he was doing there. Upon leaving the cave, his uncovered skin began to burn violently. He covered himself with the robe as best he could and traveled out, hoping to find something he recognized.\n\nHe arrived in the paragon city of Demacia. There, he was found by Luxanna Crownguard, better known as Lux. The daughter of the model Demacian family brought Tennon to the Crownguard estate. There, he told her of his plights, his lack of memory. She listened and offered advice, but couldn&rsquo;t help him much. He thanked her for listening to him, and left the estate. Hours later, however, a dark cloud covered the sky over Demacia. It sucked everything into the sky, people, buildings, everything. Lux, desperate to help the people of the city, fired abilities and spells at the sky. However, they seemed to have been absorbed by the cloud, and these spells were thrown back at Lux.\n\nTennon wasn&rsquo;t pulled into the sky, but instead pulled towards the center of the dark storm. Upon reaching the eye, the storm stopped and closed in around Tennon. All people and things that had been absorbed were returned back where they were. However, the orb stayed in the middle of Demacia for days, unmoving.\n\nAfter exactly 11 days, the orb deteriorated to reveal Tennon, alive and well, but different at the same time. He rushed to the Crownguard Estate and demanded to be Lux&rsquo;s personal bodyguard. He revealed to her secrets only the two of them know. When asked about what happened for those 11 days, he refuses to answer and turns pale. However, upon awakening, he had acquired powers of darkness, the same as the cloud over Demacia.\n\nWhatever the purpose of the cloud and Tennon may be, he knows it has something to do with Lux, and he will fight to make sure  whatever evil that almost consumed Demacia shall never succeed again.\n\n**_The Passive List_**\n**Aatrox** Every third auto attack heals Tennon for 20 health.\n**Ahri** Enemies who Shadows are still regenerating take true damage from **E &ndash; Shade Rip.**\n**Akali** Enemies hit by **E &ndash; Shade Rip** have the Shadow Kama debuff for 2.5 seconds.

A buff that gives a 70% attack speed boost and bonus dmg on 4 hits probably doesnt need a 5 second duration. Especially if this is a kite/chase down hero.\n\nThe E seems to cheap in the cost department for 10% of someones hp pool. I'm not picking on you specifilly either. I think almost all newer heros riot introduced have absurdly low costs on skills or no resources at all.\n\nAs far as the ult goes I don't think they would go for one that steals that many stats and gets cd refunded. Just look at how many people hate trundle's ult atm because it does that but tank oriented.\n\nI think overall the character is cool but just a tad bit on the overloaded side. I can easily see this guy owning the top lane with almost no retaliation from his lane opponent. I absolutely love that he doesn't have a built in flash move. Too many champs have those (including many proposed champ concept heros) and it is kinda killing the game for non flash move heros.\n\nAlso a passive idea, sorry last thing, maybe instead of going through the entire roster ,which would require an update with every new hero released, he has a mejais effect still but he pulls from a pool of like 7 deities. Over the course of the match if you do well enough you could have all 7 or however many you want. They don't even have to be deities. They could be personalities personified or elements. You could have passive buffs reflecting each faction currently in game.","replies":[{"poster":"PyroAeroVampire","date":"2016-06-09T18:48:21.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=zlumpy,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=9fL6hbE1,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2016-06-09T04:07:13.788+0000)\n>\n> I imagine someone with max 45% cooldown being able to kite just a little too well.

I think almost all newer heros riot introduced have absurdly low costs on skills or no resources at all.\n> \n\nThe reason why it deals so much percent damage is as a tank buster. A person has to have 2700 health at rank 5 for this ability to deal 10% of their health. In my head, depending on the play style of the player, this is the last ability a person ranks. This is something I also wanted to accomplish with this design. Rather than have a champion where \"What ability do I max first?\" is more than just common logic. It's a situational thing for a player to not immediately know what ability to max first, at least until they see the opponents play style and champion. Very few champions have this. The only one I can think of off the top of my head is Sion (Q = Aggressive vs. Low Mobility, W = Passive, E = Poke vs. Low Sustain).\n\nOn to why I stated that. If E is maxed first, it's got a lot of base damage. However, if the enemy doesn't have their Shadow, then the ability has massively reduced effectiveness. It's a tank busting ability that is meant to simply deal some immediate damage in a duel, then to deal some minor damage to weave in if the fight lasts long enough. Looking at it now, the .75 AP ratio is a bit deceiving as to the purpose of the ability, so I can tone it down, if that helps.\n\nThanks for commenting! :)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"hipopotosaur","date":"2016-06-06T23:18:50.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"interesting idea but perhaps rather than stealing a buff specific to EVERY SINGLE champion, as there would be FAR to much to think about when u see hime get chosen in champ select, maybe instead he could get buffs for killing them based on their class, he could get a move speed/ad buff from assassins, max hp from tanks, so on and so forth, alot less to worry about and to code, although i appreciate the work you put into all those buffs XD\n\nEx:\nShadow of the assassin: upon killing an assassin gain X% of their AD\nShadow of the fighter: upon killing a fighter gain X% of their crit chance\nShadow of the mage: upon killing a mage gain X% of ther AP\nShadow of the support: upon killing a support grants a stacking aura that gives a portion of these buffs to nearby allies\nShadow of the tank: upon killing a tank gain X% of their max HP\nShadow of the marksman: upon killling a marksman gain X% of their atk speed\n\nalso, 2 sec cd on the Q???","replies":[{"poster":"PyroAeroVampire","date":"2016-06-09T03:45:16.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I read it at first and thought \"It's not a 2 sec CD...\" then i realized you were probably talking about the Zilean Buff.\n\nYeah, I think the Zilean buff is quite up there, but it's only when it hits an enemy champion that it reduces his cooldowns. Should it only reduce his OTHER ability cooldowns and not his Q?

Picture here: http://orig14.deviantart.net/4f8e/f/2012/155/6/d/broly_rises_up_by_tomycase-d529tan.png\n\nHis old Q was a physical damage DoT ability, but getting damage didn't increase the damage of each tick. Instead, it increased the _duration_ of the ability. Basically, based on rank, it did a maximum amount of damage per tick. If it passed 35% of a tick's max damage, it would actually cause the ability, which slowed by up to 50%, to last 1 second longer. Honestly, I think it's an idea that Riot can look into. Perhaps for a certain Gravdigger's rework?\n\nThe closest I can come to what I think Tennon should look like is Blackheart from the 2007 Ghost Rider film. While an enemy is affected by his ult, he turns into what Blackheart tends to look like in the Ghost Rider comics.\n\nBlackheart Film: http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/16508/688403-blackheart5.jpg\n\nBlackheart Comics: http://www.fightersgeneration.com/nz3/character/blackheart-avengers-alliance-marvel-artwork.png\n\nAlso, I will soon post something else on the Concepts & Creations board, so look out for that if you want!\n\n:)","replies":[]},{"poster":"pasta zugotini","date":"2016-06-06T22:14:43.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"very original, interesting concept.\nno offence but there was absolutely no way I would read ALL the buffs XD.\nthe kit looks like fun even without the buffs any way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-06-06T21:21:51.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems a bit overcomplicated with the different buffs for each champion.

I wanted some way to make the RNG part of it as little as possible, but alas. Although, here's some math for you.\n\nRoughly, the kill participation for Mid Laners across all ranks is just over 50%, so let's assume 50.5%. In a game where the Team Tennon is on gets 30 kills across the 40 minute game (Let's just assume this, as I can't think of a more average sounding game)\n\nIn that scenario, Tennon would get an average of **15 takedowns per game.** In that event, he would get 3 random passives and, with the current meta being at least a squishy support or a squishy jungler, Tennon would get maybe 3 or 4 unique kills in a game. That being said, we can assume that, in the most average possible game numerically, **Tennon would get 6 or 7 different Passive Buffs, with only 3 of them being decided through RNG**\n\nI thought of the random buffs being a bonus for participating with his team, while the 5 buffs a Tennon knows he can get from his opponents are things he can directly hunt for. With how little CC Tennon has naturally, Tennon has to decide if he wants to hunt for the enemy Zyra for the CC or attempt get the Maokai for the healing.\n\nAlso, most buffs don't really change how the Tennon should play. At least, it wasn't intended that way. Each buff is supposed to be just a little extra thing for Tennon, like a knick-knack he got on that vacation.\n\nHopefully I explained something? I ramble a lot. :P","replies":[]}]}]}
