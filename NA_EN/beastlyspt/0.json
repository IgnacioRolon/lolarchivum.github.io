In addition, though, I suggest[ enabling low spec mode](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/JUMOM3jH-i-cant-play-the-new-client-on-my-computer).

Test it in a custom to prevent any penalties, and let me know that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Beastlyspt","date":"2017-04-29T00:02:39.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well it wont make it to champ select ....

Have you re-logged yet in case client is missing an update?  You might be unable to queue up for a match until the patcher's grabbed necessary updates to get you on the same patch as everyone else.  If the issue continues, try the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure that your network can both get updates and keep you connected to the matchmaking service.
