I've played this game since season 2 and put a lot of time and money into one account. The reason I know this is due to the \"Random Icon Chest\" you can purchase in the store. When I hit it again, It tells me  \"my pool needs to be at least 1 and I am at 0\".\r\n\r\nThe reason for this discussion: ****Does this mean I can't receive anymore icons, like I hit a max limit?****\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows the answer to this, please let me know! \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n- Avatar","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-02T03:03:56.755+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhh so you don't have an Icon Limit, but in order to get one of the random icons you need to not own at least 1 of the possible icons. Basically what this means is, when you do the Random Icon you get one from a list. Right now, you earn everything on that list xD!","replies":[{"poster":"Avatar Ganja","date":"2017-06-02T03:24:45.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the clarification!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Warhammer Titan","date":"2017-06-02T03:07:38.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean obviously you cant receive any more icons if you own them all.","replies":[]}]}
