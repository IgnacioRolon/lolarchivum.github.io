Options to address that include just looking at kills+assists and grading that as opposed to kills/assists separately, or just directly changings the weights (so being in the top 1% for kills on a support is only as impactful as being in the top 40% for assists or something).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps you could be looking at entirely new metrics to consider (amount shielded/healed and that sort of thing), which would likely disproportionately impact support grading compared to other roles.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see what is produced.

You can also just farm, play safe, not worry about objectives, and get an S as a solo laner as your team gets completely destroyed.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2016-07-03T15:17:29.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as it goes people still do not understand how the champion mastery system works. \nIt is based off of the average grading of that champion in your region. \nI.e {{champion:267}}  will have an average of 2/2/25 and 35 cs for an example. Get a certain percent over that and you will have succeeded.\nThe biggest issue that lies in supports is that a lot of games you will be lucky too get over 30 cs, and when you do, you might have only gotten 1 kill. \nSo you may go 0/2/44 and 50 cs as {{champion:267}} , but you haven't succeeded the average kill count, and as a result, do not earn an S. \nThere are times in which having exceedingly high Assists compared to Kills will override that statistic but it's all face value. \nThis is one of the reasons why Sona's have the highest success rate when it comes to Earning S- and further rankings.
