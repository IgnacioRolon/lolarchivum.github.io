Unless it was pretty highly situational, I think it would be problematic because for most people, when playing kha'zix they think \"If I stay near allies, I am safe[ish]\" but by giving kha'zix a reliable way to force isolation, it kinda eliminates that point.\n\nI think the only way they could let him force isolation is if it was on a big tradeoff that would limit his effectiveness otherwise.  Like if his W evo lost its slow and gained the isolation force, that **might** work, idk, hard to call that one imo.","replies":[{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2015-02-17T23:18:04.001+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does Nocturne's ult apply isolation?
