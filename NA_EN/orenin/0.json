I've organized the major events in this article; note that while these are all confirmed, there's no timeframe, so they might not happen in 2015.","url":"http://www.newsoflegends.com/index.php/tag/poppy-rework/","image":"http://www.newsoflegends.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Poppy-Concept.jpg"},"up_votes":39,"down_votes":27,"body":"So I read this article, which made several points about why Poppy is probably going to be reworked. The only thing is, some of the points are a bit off the mark. The real reason they are reworking her is probably that she is unpopular, but as a poppy main seeing all of this slander against my favorite champion annoys me greatly.\n\nQuoting from the article:   \n\n* However, Poppy isn’t exactly handing out counterplay tips. Her main cons – an abysmally small mana pool and lack of wave-clear – don’t give enemies an opportunity to abuse; they just keep Poppy toned down so she doesn’t dominate.\n\nThis is absolutely untrue. Poppy has clear weaknesses that are not hard to exploit, and they are fairly obvious. This article makes it sound like no waveclear and low mana are trivial, but this is not true. Minion waves will constantly be pushed into your turret, making it possible for the enemy champion to roam freely, and putting damage on the turret. Her mana pool is so low that poppy can literally run out of mana before doing enough damage to kill the enemy champion, if they have any form of sustain. Of course, in a 1v1 she would have the damage, but again, poppy can only go in at set times(determined by the minion waves which she cannot clear) so invariably the opponent has ample time to sustain back up. This weak early game is a big weakness. These weaknesses are the whole reason she is not played. If she were dominating, people would be playing her more. \n\nIn addition to these, Poppy's other weakness is that she has several bad match-ups. Anybody with range counters her, because her only gapcloser(which costs more mana than her hammer blow) does minimal damage and pushes her into the enemy minion wave(Assuming they dont decide to randomly walk next to a wall). If poppy goes even in laning, then she has done her job.\n\nAlso, Poppy also has extremely poor pathing compared to other champions. She is the only champion I have played where you can literally permanently get stuck between a minion and a wall, until you kill the minion. This doesn't happen every game, but it happens frequently enough. even without this, you will miss more cs from being randomly pathed around than you would on another champion. \n\n* The main offenders are her passive and ultimate. Blocking chunks of damage innately and constantly is just raw statistical power. The enemy gets hardly any feedback, visual or number-wise, when spells hit Poppy for halved damage. It’s not really a passive you can play around in a teamfight or even in lane, unless you’ve true damage or low-cooldown spells. \n\nThe enemy knows when poppy was saved by her passive. About every other game I hear \"Poppy passive OP\". If the problem is that her passive doesn't give the enemy feedback, then implement that feedback. The passive itself is very unique and well designed. \n\n* Worse, still, this passive defines Poppy as a bruiser, meaning her appeal lies in bad design. \n\nCan I please slap whoever wrote this. The passive doesn't define poppy as anything. Barring a veigar ultimate, this passive ussually only comes into use when poppy is less than 200-300 HP and about to die. If the numbers fall right, it can practically be nullified and not matter. It ussually gives her an extra autoattack or 2 of survivability, no more. Her kit is what defines her as a bruiser, not her passive. \n\n * Lategame Poppy\n\nLategame poppy is strong. Not dominating, but strong. The problem is that when she uses her ultimate, the counterplay is to simply walk away from her. If the carry is not near a wall, she has a hard time killing them without ignite. In addition, whoever she ults can either CC her(if you ult the support), or do massive damage to her(if you ult someone else). This means poppy has to be very careful about when she goes in. The question is always \"Can I catch up to the fleeing carry and do enough damage to kill them\". Poppy doesn't have insane amounts of damage, and she has to stick to the carry for at least long enough to deliver 2 hammer blows(4~ second cooldown) if she wants to kill them unaided. Thinking about when to ult and who to ult is an important lategame decision that will test a player strategically. \n\n* Diplomatic Immunity reminds me a bit of Magic The Gathering’s Black Lotus, in that almost every Champion can replace their ultimate with Poppy’s.*\n\nOne can make an arguement that x champions ult could be swapped with y champion, and in some cases it's true. But poppy's ult suits her very well. The ult is very well named, since poppy is a diplomat, and diplomats have diplomatic immunity. The ult is very clever and goes with her kit. \n\nTL;DR: Please don't take the unique champion poppy is and turn her into a generic bruiser. Her current design is not bad. At the moment, she is fairly balanced, has exploitable weaknesses, and has counterplay options. All poppy needs is some QoL buffs, such as improving her pathing around minions.\n\nIf there is a rework just plz keep her Q the way it is. hitting someone in the face is what makes poppy fun.

Karma's rework has at least some value and was starting from a very flawed champion.

This article makes it sound like no waveclear and low mana are trivial, but this is not true. \n\nYou're absolutely right, no waveclear and low mana aren't trivial. However, they aren't by any means fun for the Poppy player, nor do they necessarily hold her back post-lane phase.  It's strictly an early game limitation that can be bypassed with a crystal flask start and a rushed sheen, which would give her ample mana to blow up whatever opponent is facing her. You mentioned that Poppy can run out of mana quite easily when fighting, but then you say: \n\n\n> Of course, in a 1v1 she would have the damage \n\nOne of the staples of top lane is that it is relatively isolated from the rest of the map. Many times Poppy is left in a 1v1 for an extended period of the game. Not to mention she can also get an early vamp scepter and lifesteal up to full. \n\n> In addition to these, Poppy's other weakness is that she has several bad match-ups. Anybody with range counters her, because her only gapcloser(which costs more mana than her hammer blow) does minimal damage and pushes her into the enemy minion wave(Assuming they dont decide to randomly walk next to a wall). \n\nLet's make this clear: any ranged counters (Quinn, Vayne, Lissandra) Poppy might have, every other top laner has as well. Furthermore, literally every top laner has huge counters. You pick Sion? Let me pick riven. You choose tryndamere? Hi, I'm Jax. Having counters that can shut you down in the lane is nothing new, nor is it a good reason to argue a champion's overall strengths or weaknesses. You also fail to mention that her gapcloser that does \"minimal damage\" gets that damage more than doubled if she runs someone into a wall. At max rank, it's a 183% increase in damage compared to the initial damage. That's not minimal. Nothing about her kit is minimal. Her q does 8% of a target's max hp AND and flat bonus AND scales 100% off of ad AND applies on-hit effects AND converts her auto into magic damage. No wonder it has a high mana cost; it literally does everything a damaging ability cold possibly do. \n\n> Also, Poppy also has extremely poor pathing compared to other champions. She is the only champion I have played where you can literally permanently get stuck between a minion and a wall, until you kill the minion. This doesn't happen every game, but it happens frequently enough. even without this, you will miss more cs from being randomly pathed around than you would on another champion. \n\nExcuse you. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMxiQl-s-7I \n\n> The enemy knows when poppy was saved by her passive. About every other game I hear \"Poppy passive OP\". If the problem is that her passive doesn't give the enemy feedback, then implement that feedback. The passive itself is very unique and well designed. \n\nYeah, we know when she was \"saved\", and we are extremely frustrated by it because a champion that can literally become invincible also mitigates 50% of the damage done to her. It has no counterplay, no way to get around, it simply tips every fight more in her favor. Is it well designed? Of course not. It's a simple damage mitigation. if you want a unique passive look at Sona or Syndra. Their passives enhance their gameplay and open up more options for them, and consequently more decisions for the opponents. Poppy's passive does none of this. It's simply: Hey, you're not doing damage to me!\n\n\n> The passive doesn't define poppy as anything. Barring a veigar ultimate, this passive ussually only comes into use when poppy is less than 200-300 HP and about to die. If the numbers fall right, it can practically be nullified and not matter. It ussually gives her an extra autoattack or 2 of survivability, no more. Her kit is what defines her as a bruiser, not her passive. \n\nHer passive comes in literally every time she goes in for a trade; it just happens more often when you're low. Imagine you, Poppy, have 1000 hp. Any ability or attack that will do 100 damage or more will lose half of its damage. That's at least 50 damage that simply won't happen. It doesn't matter if this passive defines her or not; it's a ridiculously overpowered passive. An auto or two in a fight-to-the-death can be huge, and this passive mitigates that damage and more!\n\n\n> Lategame poppy is strong. Not dominating, but strong. \n\nTell that to the adc that was one-shot by Poppy and watches her run away clean because she can't be cc'd or damaged by anyone. \n\n>The problem is that when she uses her ultimate, the counterplay is to simply walk away from her. \n\nExactly. This is terrible counterplay, especially considering Poppy has a speed boost, targeted gapcloser/stun, and regularly builds BotrK. You just gave a huge reason why Poppy needs to be reworked.\n\n>If the carry is not near a wall, she has a hard time killing them without ignite.\n\nI assume you don't play any squishy carries, or just don't notice when you delete them from the map.\n\n>  poppy has to be very careful about when she goes in. \n\nAgain, everyone has to be careful about when they go in. I can't 1v5 a team as Zed, nor should I initiate a fight as Amumu unless my team is behind me. This point is irrelevant to your argument.\n\n>Poppy doesn't have insane amounts of damage, and she has to stick to the carry for at least long enough to deliver 2 hammer blows(4~ second cooldown) if she wants to kill them unaided.\n\nUh. Um. Poppy has assassin-level damage mid/late game. Killing someone in four seconds is kind of ridiculous, especially when you're able to tank an entire team while doing so. Furthermore, you failed to mention how much damage your gapcloser does, as well as the bonus 35 AD, 35 armor, and 25% ms you get from Poppy's w. This makes it easy for her to tank and kill a target quickly.\n\n>Thinking about when to ult and who to ult is an important lategame decision that will test a player strategically. \n\nNo it isn't. Not even close. Who should I ult? The tank that does no damage, has limited cc, long cooldowns, and wants to dive my team, or anyone else on their team? The question answers itself. \n\n\n> One can make an arguement that x champions ult could be swapped with y champion, and in some cases it's true. But poppy's ult suits her very well. The ult is very well named, since poppy is a diplomat, and diplomats have diplomatic immunity. The ult is very clever and goes with her kit. \n\nExcuse me, but what? Poppy's ult could literally go on any other fighter/bruiser/tank in the game and make that champion OP. It doesn't just suit her well, it suits everyone well.  The name, again, is completely irrelevant to the actual argument. We're arguing balance and kit health, not how one of her skills has \"diplomat\" in the name. Finally, your last statement is completely unsupported by any evidence. You simply throw it at the end of your argument like someone throws trash on the side of a road. \n\n> TL;DR: Please don't take the unique champion poppy is and turn her into a generic bruiser. Her current design is not bad. At the moment, she is fairly balanced, has exploitable weaknesses, and has counterplay options. All poppy needs is some QoL buffs, such as improving her pathing around minions.\n\nHate to break it to you, but Poppy is not just a generic bruiser, but a poorly designed one. Her kit exalts low counterplay, broken abilities, and a horrifically unfun experience for anyone who has the misfortune of playing with or against her. She has no real weaknesses that an opponent can exploit, and can't really be outplayed. Any buffs to Poppy now would make her broken beyond belief, leaving the only option a full rework of her kit and her identity.","replies":[{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-02-05T06:48:55.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Did you just say Poppy has a good laning phase? Maybe, and it's a** big **maybe, Poppy could go even vs some of the older champs like {{champion:72}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:36}} . Put her up against any champ released in the past year and she is going to get decimated. Huge mana problems, no sustain, and no poke.\n\nShe makes up for it by having raw, unmatched damage and tankiness mid and late game, but Riot thinks having high scalings and high defenses is OP so they are going to rework AKA nerf her.\n\nPoppy is right now one of the few immobile champs who can clown on these newer, highly mobile champs, simply because she can do lethal damage before they get the opportunity to self peel. Few things frustrate me more than fighting a mobile champ, because they come in and pick a fight with you, and the moment they realize they are outmatched, all they do is start walking toward a wall. I know exactly what they are going to do once they reach that wall, but because I have no mobility there is nothing I can do other than try to kill them before they get to that wall, i'm fighting the clock instead of my actual opponent. Many champions can't kill fast enough anymore thanks to nerfs because apparently having enough damage to do that makes them OP, but being able to pass through a wall every ten seconds is perfectly balanced. But when I'm playing my beloved {{champion:78}}, I laugh at this tactic. Not only am I usually doing insane damage before they realize they are outmatched, but by walking directly to a wall, they give me a free stun and double the damage on my E. \n\nOf course mobility over everything, which is why a champion that gets a free stun when someone tries to abuse mobility is going to get nerfed, because \"lacks counterplay\". Hell they'll probably try to even stuff some mobility in Poppy's reworked kit. But i'm doubtful that Poppy will keep her identity as the deceptively strong and durable killer that we all know and love.\n\nRIP the only assassin tank in the game, you will be missed dearly. {{champion:78}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Tilomentry","date":"2015-02-05T07:28:35.372+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Poppy has a dash and 25% MS boost.

This article makes it sound like no waveclear and low mana are trivial, but this is not true. \n> \n> You're absolutely right, no waveclear and low mana aren't trivial. However, they aren't by any means fun for the Poppy player, nor do they necessarily hold her back post-lane phase.  It's strictly an early game limitation that can be bypassed with a crystal flask start and a rushed sheen, which would give her ample mana to blow up whatever opponent is facing her. You mentioned that Poppy can run out of mana quite easily when fighting, but then you say: \n> \n> One of the staples of top lane is that it is relatively isolated from the rest of the map. Many times Poppy is left in a 1v1 for an extended period of the game. Not to mention she can also get an early vamp scepter and lifesteal up to full. \n> \n> Let's make this clear: any ranged counters (Quinn, Vayne, Lissandra) Poppy might have, every other top laner has as well. Furthermore, literally every top laner has huge counters. You pick Sion? Let me pick riven. You choose tryndamere? Hi, I'm Jax. Having counters that can shut you down in the lane is nothing new, nor is it a good reason to argue a champion's overall strengths or weaknesses. You also fail to mention that her gapcloser that does \"minimal damage\" gets that damage more than doubled if she runs someone into a wall. At max rank, it's a 183% increase in damage compared to the initial damage. That's not minimal. Nothing about her kit is minimal. Her q does 8% of a target's max hp AND and flat bonus AND scales 100% off of ad AND applies on-hit effects AND converts her auto into magic damage. No wonder it has a high mana cost; it literally does everything a damaging ability cold possibly do. \n> \n> Excuse you. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMxiQl-s-7I \n> \n> Yeah, we know when she was \"saved\", and we are extremely frustrated by it because a champion that can literally become invincible also mitigates 50% of the damage done to her. It has no counterplay, no way to get around, it simply tips every fight more in her favor. Is it well designed? Of course not. It's a simple damage mitigation. if you want a unique passive look at Sona or Syndra. Their passives enhance their gameplay and open up more options for them, and consequently more decisions for the opponents. Poppy's passive does none of this. It's simply: Hey, you're not doing damage to me!\n> \n> Her passive comes in literally every time she goes in for a trade; it just happens more often when you're low. Imagine you, Poppy, have 1000 hp. Any ability or attack that will do 100 damage or more will lose half of its damage. That's at least 50 damage that simply won't happen. It doesn't matter if this passive defines her or not; it's a ridiculously overpowered passive. An auto or two in a fight-to-the-death can be huge, and this passive mitigates that damage and more!\n> \n> Tell that to the adc that was one-shot by Poppy and watches her run away clean because she can't be cc'd or damaged by anyone. \n> \n> Exactly. This is terrible counterplay, especially considering Poppy has a speed boost, targeted gapcloser/stun, and regularly builds BotrK. You just gave a huge reason why Poppy needs to be reworked.\n> \n> I assume you don't play any squishy carries, or just don't notice when you delete them from the map.\n> \n> Again, everyone has to be careful about when they go in. I can't 1v5 a team as Zed, nor should I initiate a fight as Amumu unless my team is behind me. This point is irrelevant to your argument.\n> \n> Uh. Um. Poppy has assassin-level damage mid/late game. Killing someone in four seconds is kind of ridiculous, especially when you're able to tank an entire team while doing so. Furthermore, you failed to mention how much damage your gapcloser does, as well as the bonus 35 AD, 35 armor, and 25% ms you get from Poppy's w. This makes it easy for her to tank and kill a target quickly.\n> \n> No it isn't. Not even close. Who should I ult? The tank that does no damage, has limited cc, long cooldowns, and wants to dive my team, or anyone else on their team? The question answers itself. \n> \n> Excuse me, but what? Poppy's ult could literally go on any other fighter/bruiser/tank in the game and make that champion OP. It doesn't just suit her well, it suits everyone well.

How much do you know about Hybrid Ezreal mid, my main? Did you know he has really bad wave clear? Most people do, but did you know that he out scales most mids? Did you know that a massive part of his counter play is to position where he cannot land shift? Did you know he has a Poppy like late game? Did you know that flux's hit box is longer than the animation? There are a lot of things that are simple to me, that I see clearly as a hybrid Ez main. But are not at all clear to the people I play against. You see the weakness of Poppy clearly because you play her, but you do not see what others see. I have been playing for years and still am confused on how Poppy's ult works because I have attacked Poppy's who I thought are ulting and I've done DMG to them. And lack of wave clear and a low mana pool does not present clear counter play. It's not don't get hit by a skill shot, it's not don't get close to her it's abstract weaknesses that though very real are not seen. Same with the power given from her passive and the DMG her ult gives to her target. Her W *is* just a pile of stats that gives little counter play and has right at no interaction, and the cheery on top is the fact that her Q scales off max HP, though that does have reason. \n\nThen as an enemy how do you get repaid for falling prey to not abusing her abstract weaknesses? With one of the most powerful late game monsters, who seams to have even less weaknesses. He passive, W and ult my he amazingly hard to kill and it's not clear why. Poppy can build a lot of DMG and still be very tanky. Bottom line is the reason you don't see the problems with her is because you play her, you don't play against her. And even when you do play against her you know what to do because you play her.\n\n You know why people say \"Poppy's passive is OP\" in chat? Because it is not apparent and does not give good feed back. We are in a fight, and the entire lane my spells have done 200 DMG to you, your at 400 life and I have 3 spells, 200 DMG each. I got you low with autos because and have not relyzed how little my spells do to you now. So BAME I all in you, hit you with all 3 spells, expecting to have more than enough DMG to kill you but to my amazement you live at a sliver of HP and return your combo, killing me. I look at death recap floored and then it hits me what had happened. People don't say \"Poppy's passive is OP\" in chat because they know about it, they say it because they don't know about it. It's not tell after the fight that the see what happened, and quite frankly if you think that's a well designed passive you don't understand what clarity means. To you it was clear, to you you knew all along that another spell rotation would be reduced by her passive and you are safe, in fact that's the only reason you positioned the way you did. I know this feeling very well as hybrid Ezreal, I get comments too about his power because people don't know how much DMG he does. People don't expect me to full to dead you(with ignite) as hybrid Ezreal, they are used to AD Ez. However unlike Poppy they can still doge my skill shots, they may not know just how much DMG I do, but they do know they need to not get hit by a skill shot. Poppy needs work, and hopefully her rework will let you still enjoy what you love about her, while fixing her problems.","replies":[{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-02-05T07:22:16.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Champs with mobility, like Ezreal, are the ones with truly no counterplay.\n\n\"So this champion is going to come attack you, and when he realizes he is outmatched he is going start walking to a wall and if you aren't mobile that's just too bad. Oh wait, this champion went out of his way to pick a fight with you, and because he doesn't know your abilities and didn't check your items, he didn't realize he would lose until after he started attacking you. But everyone deserves second chances, which is why he gets to survive if he can reach that wall in x amount of seconds. Also damage is OP, which is why we are going to nerf non-mobile high damage champs to the point where they are incapable of killing that champ in x amount of seconds, but at the same time we are going to buff their defenses so that way it is defined as a rebalance instead of a nerf (*cough* *cough*{{champion:86}}) .\"\n\nYou should go play an immobile champ (I define immobile as a champ that cannot pass a wall without flash). Because you don't have a flash with 10sec cooldown, you really learn how to assess a situation and learn combat patterns before you pick a fight. It will be satisfying, I promise your strategic skill in the game will improve significantly.\n\nAnd then you will see how infuriating it is to be screwed out of a kill when someone absolutely insists on picking a fight with you, then realizes that you are capable of killing them without breaking a sweat, so they spend the next five seconds walking toward a wall, and if you can't kill them before they reach that wall well then it's your fault for not knowing how to fight.\n\nImmobile champs are punished with death for walking into a bad situation. Meanwhile if an unskilled player fails to bother learning abilities or checking items, he gets no punishment for making a terrible decision because he can flash through a wall every 10 seconds, while the skilled player he tried to pick a fight with gets punished by not getting a kill he rightfully deserves, simply because he is an immobile champ.","replies":[{"poster":"Kitten of Evil","date":"2015-02-05T23:30:13.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on the champion and the situation.

Sure, it's unique, in the sense that it is easily the most powerful passive in the game. it is not well designed in the slightest.\n\nIt's just a massive amount of free invisible health, with no gameplay or counterplay on either side. if you're fighting Poppy, you can't \"bait it out\" or avoid it, or work around it. It's just going to massively reduce any burst damage you deal to her when she's low on health. Are you playing a champion like Garen or Voli who relies on an execute? Tough beans, she will always take 50% damage from it the entire game with no counterplay. \n\nIf this effect was tied into an active ability, or if it had a cooldown, or if she had to do something to trigger it, it would be fine. But she doesn't have to do anything. It doesn't change the way she plays. There's no way to \"outplay\" her passive.
