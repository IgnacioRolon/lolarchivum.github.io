They seem to be obsessing over getting as many people to queue up together as possible. That&#039;s fine, i don&#039;t mind playing with many people queued together. But **people queuing solo should have the same access to crafting materials as people queuing in groups**. If you are in a group, you'll likely get some crafting materials almost every game. But if you are solo, it might be once ever 5 games. How is this fair to solo players? \n\n     Obviously, thinking of solutions is not the issue here. They **deliberately** said, \"no, we will make sure solo players don't get as much, because we want people to play in groups\". That is what is so infuriating. They **deliberately** said \"hey you like playing solo? Well, too bad. Group up or you won't get as much as these other players\". \n\nIn the past, I have always been impressed by Riots decision making. Even in situations where they themselves will be disadvantaged, they always did what was fair to their players. They have done a lot of things right. I won't go into everything here, but they seem like a good company. But this outright discrimination against solo players is very disturbing to me. \n","replies":[{"poster":"SelflessTeammate","date":"2016-03-17T14:58:50.718+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just wanna chime in that I don't wanna ruin my friendships by playing Ranked with them.

Which would be fine if, you know, they weren't treated like the exact same mode in pretty much every meaningful way, sans the whole rank thing. Makes me miss Team Builder, because that was by far the best for groups of friends.\n\nSeriously, I have two separate groups, friends and ranked partners. They're separate for very, very good reason. Friends are for hanging out and enjoying a game, the equivalent of having a cup of coffee together. Ranked partners I don't even have to like, and many I don't exactly enjoy the company of because they're sort of pricks, and I'm sure they don't really like me, either. They're like a list of independent contractors. We may not even get along at all, but at least we work well together from a gameplay perspective.\n\nThere's a really big difference, man.

Climbed to silver later that year after actualy trying, but it was at the end of the season, then the reset. Placed in Bronze 3... annoying, but hey I climbed, I will again... I climbed all the way to placements for Silver 5, then fell down to Bronze 2 again from baddies, then back up to placements for Silver 5, then BACK to Bronze 2 from baddies... Im {{summoner:3}} ed. Trying to play that nonsense \"Ranked\" pit of baddies failing with their baddie friends is driving me out of the game.\n\nI like to play support, and often only bot lane is the only lane not lost... till the fed mids/tops start roaming bot to shut us down from my feeding team mates. I figure \"Fine Il go top and carry with a tank...\" Nope, some triple que of top/mid/jg wont let me win, they bring out the perfect ganks via voice chat.\n\nOn top of the advantages of playing with friends... They get more \"stuff\" too? Thats just great Riot, you guys are awesome. Riot does have something for solo players though... two things actualy. Theyre giving us a big F followed up by a U, to all solo players... isnt that nice.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"iainB85","date":"2016-03-17T17:16:01.647+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know why Riot is so hellbent on telling us how to enjoy their game.\n\n\"We won't make sandbox mode because the best way to learn League of Legends is playing against other people!\"\n\n\"The best way to enjoy League of Legends is to group with other people, so we are killing solo queue, introducing dynamic queue, and giving more rewards to people for playing together!\"\n\nHey Riot, stop telling me what the best \"League of Legend experience\" is and let me enjoy the game how I want to without losing on benefits!

Riot has been stingy with it's knowledge resources. How do you look up the AP ratio on TF's Q? You either:\nA) Get into a game, observe the numbers, and do the math yourself.\nor\nB) Go to the LoLwiki and look.\n\nOr maybe you want to figure out what kind of spell effects Pantheon's Q applies. Same situation: Go into the game, buy a whole bunch of spell effect items, and toss Qs at enemies; or just look it up on some non-Riot website.\n\nThe worst part is that we can't even get a sandbox mode to test out builds and combinations without having to start a custom game and spend 15-20 minutes farming up the gold and/or levels to begin testing. It shouldn't take me twenty minutes of playing to figure out that X mastery isn't interacting with Y ability or Z item despite that it appearing like it should. It's frustrating.\n\nAnd I have no idea why Riot has such a hard on for premades. If your players are playing in a premade, they don't need a reward. They already have a reward in the form of fun. You have a million times more fun in a premade than solo most of the time, so there's no need to incentivize group play. Usually soloQ players go soloQ for a reason, and that reason is probably not \"I don't like fun\".\n\nIf anything, they should be throwing soloQ players all these rewards instead. They are the ones that need more incentive to keep playing, not be told \"Hey, find a friend or get the hell out\". Hextech crafting is just the most recent discrimination against soloQ people. Sometimes it's bonus IP weekends that get bigger bonuses the more you queue up with, sometimes it's special icons that you can't earn without gifting another player, one time there was even a free Mundo skin that the community could earn by getting points and you got more points for queuing together. Where is that solo specific queue that was supposed to take the sting out of queuing solo in dynamic? Probably not coming.\n\nI can't tell you how many times I've gotten excited by a promotion, then learn that queuing up as a team is the best (or only) way to earn that cool stuff. I'm already stabbed in the arm by playing solo, Riot.
