The proposed thornmail nerf was to reduce it's damage base on enemy damage, but add damage based off your bonus Armor.\n\nAnd said armor gets ignored by Last Whisper and Black cleaver. So it sounds more like it's getting gutted.\n\nI'm a bit disturbed about the Frozen Heart nerfs. Since it's so Core on all of my top lane tanks. (Which is actually just Sion) Giving enough Mana and CDR for your spells while providing a good Armor base. It's practically Athene's for tanks. But I might over look that if Glacial shroud is getting buffed. \n\nBut if I recall correctly, the Armor nerfs were part of the fighter rework. (cause they counter fighters so Easily) Yet I also believe that the Fighter rework would come with more hybrid items. (offensive and defensive) So even if Armor gets nerfed in General, I would like to see more options.","replies":[{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2015-08-04T13:53:14.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Last Whisper won't affect anything in any way.
