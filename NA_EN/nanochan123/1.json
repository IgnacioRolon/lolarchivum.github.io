Yesterday I played Miss Fortune ADC and got S on her but weirdly enough I did not get a Chest from it even though the chest was available. Also I did complete the first Arcade mission and did not received my Arcade Icon. Why do you do this to me Riot what have I done to deserve this cruel torture!?!?{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-10T21:40:59.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like you didn't get a chest for scoring an S with Miss Fortune because you've already gotten a chest from her this season. Each champion can only give you 1 chest per season for getting an S or higher.\n\nAlso, some of those icons were a little delayed for some reason. I've sent out my best poro delivery team, so you should see that icon soon!","replies":[]}]}
