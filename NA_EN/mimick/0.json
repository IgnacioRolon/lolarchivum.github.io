Not that I don't want to go against any balance issues, but it doesn't feel like his original E that gave him a boost in AS, when it can't even give him an extra bullet unless he has lost one already. As strong as Graves is on a one on one, he lacks the push he could have. Its not until late game that the bullets aren't a issue, but I've always had a issue with the fact that if I E away from a enemy, I still only fire two shots at them unless I let them come into my 425 range so that I can hit them, back away and try two more.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Solari Fortune","date":"2016-04-20T02:07:01.825+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just want to put this somewhere\nhttp://i.imgur.com/XDro43M.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"jama655","date":"2016-04-19T23:39:18.493+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"why did they nerf wards","replies":[{"poster":"CasterGilgamesh","date":"2016-04-19T23:55:46.412+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"they always nerf vision a long time ago all supports where ward bitches now its slightly not as bad....\nof course this nerf probs for Graves and Jhin","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"THESuperStuntMan","date":"2016-04-19T23:41:31.565+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't call it secret.
