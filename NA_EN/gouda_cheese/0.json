Fixed my behavior and have tried to be super nice. People honor me almost every game and I've made tons of friends. Why am I still restricted from receiving awards? If this continues I might as well just restart on a new account, but I don't wanna waste four years of league for something fixable. Is this a glitch that my restrictions have lasted so long or is there a trick to get out of restricitons? thankyou.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-09T23:43:13.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Loot restrictions aren't lifted over a set amount of time.

I play a lot of league and it sucks to see that Im not getting recognized for making an effort to improve my behavior.","replies":[]}]}]}
