Hence why I called it an early game synergy. The only way to make it work is by turning other units into knights so that they're extremely tanky too.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2019-07-19T19:53:14.646+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"Knights is a relatively easy comp to make that's meant to be strong early.

Getting all 6 of a certain type, including requiring a cost 4 and 5, should **NOT** give you such a small bonus that it's basically a slap in the face.\n\nThe difference between 40 and 80 damage from basic attacks being blocked is freakishly low compared to the items and spell being thrown around at that point.  Getting all 6 of a type should be worth something, and right now it's laughably small.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SettDownShutUp","date":"2019-07-19T22:47:06.838+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The knights should have a second ability included in their set bonus, perhaps they charge into battle, reducing the amount of time they need to get into The fray with the opponent?
