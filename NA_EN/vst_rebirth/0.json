(normally the EULA agreement will come up twice and then the game will launch)\r\n\r\n\r\nI've tried reinstalling multiple times, running as admin, forcing a re-patch, using the repair tool, disabling my firewall, (also made sure league was an exception just in case) syncing my windows clock and configuring my dns. I've done pretty much everything I could and I still can't do anything after pressing the launch button.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-19T17:51:38.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate the troubleshooting done so far, but this may not necessarily be an issue with game files.  It sounds like your network is having trouble establishing a connection to the authentication servers, so it can't communicate that the EULA has been accepted.  Go over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to strengthen your connection and get through.  Regarding your firewall, you can use our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) which will automatically configure your firewall!  Let me know if that doesn't help!","replies":[]}]}
