Go over the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to help get this bugsplat fixed up.  Since the updated client uses the legacy client files, make sure to use the steps in the [reinstall guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends) to make sure it's processed properly.
