Personally that'd read a lot more clearly that a simple color change that prevents her from having cool looking Q's on her skins.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-05-01T05:17:32.171+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"The reason the orb isn't changed when her passive is up is due to not only Ahri knowing if she's going to heal when the orb returns, but also her enemies. It could mean the difference between securing a kill, or Ahri getting away at super low health. We want it to be super clear in this case, and while a glow would have similar gameplay implications, we think the color difference is an easier read.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-05-01T00:32:17.607+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why would you ignore anything that Ahri throws at you?

Arclight Varus's Q looks and sounds nothing like the majority of his skins, yet people still know 'try to dodge it' Plus the Soulstealer Vlad ult in the updated SR having an invisible ult...\n\nPersonally I find it really hard to see Justicar Syndras orbs in Aram (just played her there) since they are yellow/transparent on a white background. \n\nPoint is there are much more blatant skill changes that can be a lot more potent than Max stacks on Twitch.

There are some skills that are heavy as far as gameplay implications that we cannot change for the sake of clarity. Another example of this would be Kayle's ultimate.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-05-01T05:38:46.942+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"But you changed Zilean's ultimate particles.
