The next Skin Concept I want to present you is for our gooey friend, ! After the Poolparty, it slowly got colder , as the Poroking drew near. Poor Poolparty Zac did not notice the cold, and froze solid very soon. He then was found by Lissandra, the Ice witch.","url":"https://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/de/c/community-creations-en/N4RHOhaE-skin-concept-tundramonster-zac","image":"https://cdn.leagueoflegends.com/apollo/assets/vb/boards-wallpaper.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I made these two concepts a long time ago, and theyre still ikl dear to my heart.

I think a mushy snow monster skin for Zac could be cool- I especially like the black ice touch.  In Runeterra, there is a type of ice that never melts called \"true ice.\"  Trundle's club is made out of it, for example, so I think it would be a cool tie-in!\n\nFor Bard, I personally LOVE the idea of a junk/scrap tinkerer style skin, but I feel like it departs too much from his fantasy.  Bard is already a fairly niche champion, and turning him into a junkyard cretin, while hilarious and fun, would only further divide his fan base.  Not that this is your responsibility, but when we think about skins at Riot, we have to consider the audience we're trying to serve.  Sometimes that's making a more broadly appealing aesthetic for a niche champion, and other times it's offering a unique take on a champion with a universally understood aesthetic.","replies":[]}]}
