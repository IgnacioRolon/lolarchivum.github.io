I know it sucks when you're unable to connect to a game, but you should also note that it equally sucks for the 9 other people in the match. This is a big reason why disconnections are all treated equally and why we cannot remove penalties for them.\n\nI'd recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), as it addresses local network settings that commonly conflict with League and cause these problems. Let me know if those steps caused a change.","replies":[]}]}
