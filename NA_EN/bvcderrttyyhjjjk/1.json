More importantly, why would the carry be IN FRONT of minions and tanks. Ezreal's ult. has a lot of damage fall-off and Luden's does less on non-primary targets too. You have to position like a complete retard for that to be able to happen under any circumstances. Moreover, it is mathematically impossible for it to 1-shot a carry even in ideal circumstances unless there is a large gold and level disparity (keep-in mind that everyone starts with at least 30 MR). You could make similar complaints about a Ziggs ult. and none of this is even improved by Runeglaive. A LB Ezreal would actually do more damage with his ult. due to the extra AP. Countering a champion isn't just about 1vs1 either, it's about strategic decisions, counter-building, comps etc.\n\nPeople just forgot how to use their brains and adapt. Apparently, they also forgot what AP Ezreal does because most of this whining has nothing to do with Runeglaive. If your team hasn't at least gotten the first dragon before Ezreal has Luden's, you're failing miserably (especially mid). Ezreal does nothing compared to an Ahri, Talon etc. that early and your team should be taking the advantages that creates.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Anomander","date":"2015-07-03T17:34:53.499+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Runeglaive 5.13 Bugfix\nAs documented in the 7/2 PBE update, Enchantment: Runeglaive no longer procs spell effects such as Luden's Echo, Spell Vamp, or Rylai's Crystal Scepter on the PBE.\n\n Here's ricklessabandon with context on bugfix responsible for this change:\n\n\"To clarify, it was definitely a bug we missed in development. Luden's Echo will trigger on 'spell damage' which are damage sources that apply effects like the slow from Rylai's Crystal Scepter or the spell vamp from Hextech Gunblade. 'Proc damage' doesn't interact with those effects though, which is why Sunfire Cape doesn't perma-slow when you also buy Rylai's Crystal Scepter. Additionally, Luden's doesn't care about what type of damage is being applied, so Talon's Rake and Olaf's Reckless Swing would trigger the item's effect if they ever had the item (please don't try it with those champions in a real game though)… \n\nRuneglaive was always intended to be treated as 'proc damage' just like Lichbane, Iceborn Gauntlet, Sunfire Cape, etc but the damage on the primary target was flagged incorrectly (the AoE damage was correctly flagged). \n\nFun Fact: the damage from Hextech Gunblade and Luden's Echo are intended to apply spell effects. This means you could do things like shoot a champion with Gunblade, have Luden's bounce off of them to three other targets, and heal off of the damage done to all four. If you had Rylai's, they'd all be slowed too! \n\nEdit: used the word 'though' too many times and it was bothering me…\"\n\n\nCopied straight from surrender@20\nhttp://www.surrenderat20.net/2015/07/red-post-collection-mystery-icons.html","replies":[{"poster":"Ryuku Cruxis","date":"2015-07-04T04:23:18.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh wow..is Ludens bounce damage considered aoe damage or does it get full vamp?
