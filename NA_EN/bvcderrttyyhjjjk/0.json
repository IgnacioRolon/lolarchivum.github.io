Here&#039;s why.\r\n\r\nIn patch 4.9 he was nerfed, because he was too versatile and too good at being BOTH tanky and a burst assassin. However, all of his base stats and abilities were nerfed in one patch. The quite predictable result is that he immediately went from being very good at everything, to being mostly trash at everything. \r\n\r\nThis pushed him out of any competitive viability; his source of power, Isolation, is already very situational and easily countered by appropriate team compositions, builds, and gameplay. If you then don&#039;t even get a significant advantage even when you DO obtain it, the champion becomes unviable if you are trying to win seriously.\r\n\r\nFast forward a year and a half, and he&#039;s worse than ever. But why? \r\nWell, because of three big factors:\r\n- Power creep\r\n- Changes in AD items\r\n- Changes to the jungle\r\n- Crit creep\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s start with the power creep. With the passing of time and the introduction of new champions and reworks, the average strength of champions has been increasing. This is most evident with the Juggernaut update, where fighters were essentially made stronger overall, being very tanky but still dealing a lot of damage, as well as the more recent Marksmen update, which caused most AD carries to become a lot stronger than before. \r\n\r\nThis leads nicely into my next point, item changes. The AD item changes made it so that most AD items are now optimized for ADCs specifically. This means they revolve mostly around Critical Chance and Attack Speed, two stats that most assassins, and Kha&#039;Zix in particular, don&#039;t really benefit from. The result is that most assassins don&#039;t have a clear set of item choices to go for, as most of the AD items are not gold efficient for them.  \r\n\r\nAnother item related problem for Kha&#039;Zix, is the fact that jungle items have had their cost increased twice since S4, Jungle monsters have become a lot tougher, and Kha&#039;Zix still has the base stats of patch 4.9, in which they were massively nerfed; the low base stats and stronger jungle make him reliant on his first item to clear, but the first item is massively more expensive, so he gets it a lot later and he really struggles for almost half the game. This is a broader problem, as the entire jungle role has been greatly hurt in the last two seasons. Also the XP and gold snowballing from getting a kill in a gank have been reduced, both directly with numbers, and indirectly with the increase in costs of jungle and AD items. Finally, the removal of the old Last Whisper was devastating for Kha&#039;Zix, who massively relied on it to do damage.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, the higher average amount of Crit Chance that AD carries get made AD casters like Kha&#039;Zix irrelevant. They can achieve the same, if not more, damage that Kha&#039;Zix would do, just by right clicking from a distance. They became so much stronger that now, with same level and a comparable build, almost all ADCs can 1v1 Kha&#039;Zix even when isolated. This is definitely a game design failure on Riot&#039;s side. \r\n\r\nWHAT CAN BE DONE?\r\n\r\nI have a few ideas, although I am not a game designer. I hope Riot can figure out a solution themselves based on the facts I just listed, if they even care about making this champion actually playable again. \r\nHis base stats could be improved.\r\nHis cooldowns could be decreased, as they are quite lengthy and make his clears quite slow.\r\nHis uninteresting passive could be reworked into something better.\r\nHis W mana cost and cooldown could be lowered to give him better sustain while clearing.\r\nHis ult could be buffed, allowing him to blink around or take less damage, or it could be reworked entirely into something more interesting.\r\nHis evolution system could get changed so that all upgrades have a compelling value.\r\nHis Q could receive buffs, like:\r\n- The ability to crit or a mechanic that makes it so it crits isolated targets.\r\n- Better base damage and/or multiplier for isolation.\r\n- A % Max health damage or execute\r\n- An armor ignore a bit like Gangplank&#039;s barrel, maybe only if the target is isolated.\r\n\r\nThese are just random ideas off the top of my head. I legitimately don&#039;t know if they would be any good. \r\n\r\nI do believe however that my analysis and understanding of the problem is quite accurate and it could be used to solve this honestly quite big problem. I hope Riot is paying attention to this. Buffing his armor by 3 is not going to help. And he does NOT need a buff to his jump, that is the only thing in his kit that is working fine. And introducing an assassin item is also not going to solve this. It might help, but he will still be unviable. His kit was mediocre at the end of S4, but it is dreadful now, after all this time.\r\n\r\nPlease consider upvoting this so that Riot can at least be reminded of the existence and nature of this problem. They really have not been acknowledging this situation properly for far too long. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-01-08T18:50:41.148+0000","up_votes":99,"down_votes":5,"body":"The removal of Brutalizer and Last Whisper do seem to have hit Kha'Zix pretty hard and we've got some buffs planned for the next patch, focused on cases where Kha'Zix isn't quite able to get things to work.

Just compare the Brutalizer to {{item:3133}}: 237 more gold for 10 ArPen? That is super cheap and you can get it with your first B.\n\nThunderlords does magical dmg and it is not like it makes assassins better.

That being said, OP is right in saying that Khazix has probably one of the worst first clears in the game atm and got brutalized by the new itemization. Yes, Warrior is a bit better for him now, but Warhammer is not as good as Brutilizer in the build path and Warrior is even more expensive now than before so he is stuck with his terrible clears even longer.\n\nLet's talk about ganking then if his clears are terrible. You are a mana starved hard cc-less assassin that relies pretty hard on your lane helping out since you do not do nearly enough damage early on to 1v1. Your gank mainly consists of hopping on them Q'ing, using a slow af auto attack to slow, and then throwing a W after their flash to hope to catch up. Also, if they are pushed up and in their minion wave your Q's damage goes down to trash tier so if they are already beating your laner and they are stuck under tower your opponent can potentially 2v1 since you are made of paper mache and will probably die in a single rotation from most top laners.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ren Ex","date":"2016-01-08T22:10:31.752+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":"Meddler, I have to ask, have there been any ideas tossed around for Kha'Zix to give his Isolation the Garen treatment?

But Brutalizer was OP with both, so it was split into Warhammer and Dirk (which then combine back into the new Ghostblade, which has the stats of Brutalizer on steroids, along with the old Ghostblade active, but is a finished item and therefore much more expensive).\n\nLW was reworked because it was just plain broken; the conditions for wanting to build it were \"do you do mostly physical damage?\".\n\nBut it looks like Kha was just hanging on by depending on the brokenness of Brutalizer and old LW, and now can't function as well without them.\n\nAs for why Warrior builds from Warhammer and not Dirk, my guess is that Riot wants ArPen to be a more situational stat and not something people build just because their damage is physical; CDR has more widespread usefulness, and synergizes well with more of itself (e.g. Warrior > Ghostblade, which would probably work well on Kha, except what power level is everyone else by the time he farms up to that?)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PiVoRx","date":"2016-01-09T03:12:50.200+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Isnt Khazix that champion that one shot with single Q?","replies":[{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2016-01-09T13:01:29.595+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:75}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tik115","date":"2016-01-09T02:19:04.738+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Theres on massive thing Kha also needs as well\n\nHe needs to NOT have his 4th evolution tied to an event.\n\nRengars bonetooth doesn't lose stacks on death so now the only one who has something to lose is Khazix, no Rengar or no win on the event, no 4th evolution\n\nJust remove his need in that event and has his 4th skill auto evolve when he evolves the other 3","replies":[{"poster":"My Waifu Vanilla","date":"2016-01-09T10:43:34.085+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Iirc when Rengar stopped losing stacks on death they changed head of kha to give all bonuses (like before) and increase his vision by a bit while in bush/the jungle.\n\nAlso the main reason he doesn't get all 4 is because he is \"designed\" to have to make \"meaningful\" choices on what to evolve in a case by case scenario, unlike Viktor who is seeking perfection and not the Thrill of the Hunt (no rengar ult).
