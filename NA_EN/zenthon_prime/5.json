I usually go offensive masteries, but against Teemo I run 9/21/0 to better withstand his harass. I take teleport rather than ignite, since it's safer and Teemo is one champion I honestly don't feel is durable enough to warrant the ignite. The key to winning the lane is movement speed.\n\nTier one boots and a phage make Teemo so much simpler.\n\nKill a minion, then dash to him and E, then immediately W rather than canceling your AA animation. This way you can get the extra damage on him without being blinded. Auto the shit out of him and chase, Q when he gets to the outer rim. If he's dunkable, do it. Once you kill Teemo it becomes very easy to do so again. If you're not camped, I find Teemo to be a fairly simple match for Darius. Not the easiest, but I've never lost it.\n\nThe really great thing about this match is that Darius is honestly more useful in a team fight than Teemo IMO, unless the Teemo's team forces a fight in a mushroom field. He doesn't even get to outscale you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"revliledpembroke","date":"2015-07-21T23:43:49.670+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had similar cases as Garen I think.
