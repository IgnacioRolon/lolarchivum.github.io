Until then, you can&#039;t look anywhere on the map besides right where your character is.\n\n_That&#039;s okay game, I didn&#039;t want to be able to see anything anyways._\n\n[Note: This thread is **general**ly to **discuss**[ion] bugs that have existed for years and how silly it is that they&#039;re still here, so no thanks mods I don&#039;t want my thread to be removed and to be told to post it on report a bug.]","replies":[]}
