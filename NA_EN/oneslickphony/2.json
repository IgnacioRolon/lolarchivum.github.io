He seriously hits like a freaking truck and after he finally gets low from smacking my allies around for fun he'll just ult and my teammates and I will sit there like idiots trying to kill him. When I think of lots of crits, I think of Yasuo. But damn, even a fed Yasuo won't 3-shot kill me like a Tryndamere. It's utterly and completely aggravating that there is no possible counterplay as far as I can see to this champion, and as a result I get pissed off and make rage threads like this because I had a match where the Trynd 3-shot everyone on my team. People always say to run away from him during his ult, but what happens when he uses his gigantic 5 second slow or spins right into your face? Unless you're an incredibly CC resistant or mobile champion, there's no way you could possibly get out of that. Another thing that people like to say is to CC him during his ult. I happened to be playing Morgana, and if I tried to stun him I'd get 100-0'd before it goes off. (Probably not a good matchup but there was no way for me to know since it was blind pick) If you do try to chain CC him, it'll take 4 or 5 seconds of stuns and by that point your team is fresh out of CC so the ADC gets to run rampant as well.\r\n\r\nPlease, please tell me how I can kill freaking Wyndamere so that I can stop wishing I had never downloaded this game every time I see one on the loading screen. I don't like to make QQ threads, but this is an exception because the other champions I do poorly against at least have some sort of visible trick to killing them. Feel free to add your usual snarky \"git gud feg\" comments, I'll be satisfied with even one good answer so I can have fun playing this game again.","replies":[]}
