As I passed an alley, I could faintly hear sniffling sounds coming from a nearby dumpster. I went over to investigate and there before me was a boy, looking to be around 14 years old. As I looked into his large, sad eyes, I asked him, \"Hey, what are you doing here?\".\n\n\tHe responded with, \"I don't have a home anymore, the bank took my house away yesterday and Mommy and Daddy abandoned me.\" I told him that it was going to be okay and that I could take him to my apartment while I thought of how to help. He reluctantly agreed, telling me that even though he knew you weren't supposed to talk to strangers, I looked like a nice person.\n\n\tWhen we arrived at my apartment, I lead him to my living room. As I had just moved in, all that was in the room was a chair and a desk with a computer sitting on top of it. \"Here, do you know how to use a computer?\", I asked. He answered yes, saying that his dad owned one before his house got taken away. \n\n        \"You can play on this while I make a call,\" I said as grabbed my phone out of my pocket. \"I haven't hooked up my hard drive yet, so all I have on here is League of Legends. Ya ever heard of that?\"\n\n\t\"No,\" he replied. \"How do I play that?\"\n\n\tI gave him a short explanation about League of Legends, saying it was a team-based game where your goal is to beat the opponents and destroy their base. \"Ya see him?\" I inquired, pointing at the small portrait of Ryze. \"This is Ryze. He doesn't require even the smallest bit of skill, so he'd be a good champion to start with.\"\n\n\tI then joined a bots game for him and told him he was supposed to play in the middle section of the map, where a champion from the other team will fight him. He said that that sounded pretty simple, and that he'd try his best. I walked to the other side of the room and dialed the Social Services number while I watched the game progress from over his shoulder. \n\n\t\"Hello, this is Social Services. How may I help you?\" said the lady at the other end of the call. I was about to tell her my situation when I glanced back at the computer screen and saw that he already had gotten first blood and several kills.\n\n\t\"Uhhh...\" I trailed off. \"Wrong number, sorry.\" I quickly hung up and walked back over to where the boy was playing League. \n\n\t\"Wow, you've already gotten the hang of this game, haven't you?\" I said.\n\n\t\"Yeah,\" he said. \"This Ryze guy is super easy, just like you said he was. I just start hitting random keys whenever one of my enemies gets close to me and they die!\" I could hear the excitement in his voice as he spoke these words, and at once knew what I was going to do. \n\n\t\"Would... Would you like to live with me?\" I asked. \"I can adopt you and we can see if your parents come back for you.\"\n\n\tHe turned away from the screen, still hitting random buttons and scoring a double kill without even looking. \"You really mean it?\" he asked. \n\t\"Yeah! I can teach you how to play this game and I'll have someone to keep me company!\" I replied excitedly.\n\n\tFrom that moment on, we became the best of friends. When he would play, I would give him tips and watch him. He was really good, shockingly so for someone at such a young age. Within a week, he was racking up 40, 50, even 60 kills in one match. I said to him, \"I think you're ready to start playing against real people. It'll be easy, just keep playing Ryze!\" and he decided to give it a shot.\n\n\tMy summer job had just started, so I had to work most of the day. Fortunately, there was plenty of food in the fridge for him to eat if he got hungry.  After a particularly strenuous day of work, I came home to find him eagerly waiting. I asked him what he was so excited about and he took me over to the computer where he had League open. \"I found some champions that I want to play!\" he said.\n\n\t\"Oh, you did? Which ones?\" I replied.\n\n\t\"Orianna and Zed and Lissa-\"\n\n\t\"NO!\" I shouted, taking him off guard.\n\n\t\"W-what's wrong with them?\" he whimpered.\n\n\t\"I'm sorry for shouting, I had a tough day at work. You see, those characters and a few others are part of a special group.\"\n\n\t\"What group is that?\" he inquired.\n\n\t\"Freelo, my boy. They're called freelo. Freelo means a champion that is so horrendously broken that it can win just about any game with no skill required. The people that play these champions are either trash freelo abusers or professional players.\"\n\n\t\"But if they can't lose, what's the point of playing the game?\"\n\n\t\"Nobody knows. My theory is that these freelo abusers are so terrible at the game that they actually *rely* on freelo champions to climb the ranked ladder.\"\n\n\t\"Wow, I never knew that. I don't want to be a freelo abuser!\" he sobbed.\n\n\t\"Hey, hey, don't worry. As long as you stay away from that filth, you'll be fine,\" I said. \"There are also plenty of other fun champions that you can play, I'm sure you'll find some.\"\n\n\tHe had finally gotten to level 30 after a stupidly large amount of games and was ready to play ranked. In his normal games, the little guy had managed to carry most of them. His pool of champions got larger and he began playing champions such as Shaco, Udyr, and Cho'Gath. I think I even saw him get over 30 kills when he played AD Alistar top.\n\n\tSeeing how fast he climbed the ranked ladder was jaw-dropping. He skipped Bronze and Silver entirely and was out of Gold within a week. Eventually, he plateaued out at Platinum II. I think he could have easily reached Diamond if he wasn't trapped in elo hell by bad teammates. \n\t\n\n\tIt was a Thursday afternoon, many years later, and I had just gotten home from work. I expected to see him playing League as usual, but he was nowhere to be found. I called his name several times and asked the other people in my apartment if they had seen him, but no one had. I was walking into my apartment, exhausted, when I looked over and noticed a small note resting on the computer. It read:\n\n\t*Dear Unmilkable,*\n*Thank you for all you have done for me. I would have never been introduced to League of Legends if it weren't for you. I got a discovered by a new LCS team, called SK Gaming. They said I could join them and become a professional League player if I moved to Korea, and I accepted. I transferred to the Korean server and am currently in Challenger. You know how you said to never play those freelo champions? They told me that I should play them, and wow! You were right all along about them being freelo. I'm winning nearly all of my games! I really didn't want to become a freelo abuser but I guess since I'm a professional, I'm required to. By the way, LCS starts in three days. You should watch me! Once again, thanks so much for everything.*\n\n\t*Sincerely,*\n\t*Faker*\n\n**GUT THE FREELO ICE BITCH**","replies":[]}
