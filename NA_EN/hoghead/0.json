Changing the window mode doesn't affect it, but disabling vertical sync does (but of course that introduces screen tearing). No performance issues whatsoever, and it only affects the player champion when the camera is locked. The enemy and ally champions, minions, jungle creatures, map, turrets, etc. all remain smooth. \n\nI'd noticed it on the PBE while testing Elementalist Lux, but I had assumed it was an issue with the skin.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-23T22:27:42.589+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm..
