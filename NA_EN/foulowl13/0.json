In this specific post I was wondering if there was any way that Riot could make a PSA that using the term &quot;rape&quot; in regards to gameplay or anything in League is highly inappropriate and shouldn&#039;t be tolerated. I was glad when Riot decided to ban hate speech and gave players the option to report others that used it, but I really do believe that flippantly using the term &quot;rape&quot; should be included. It only encourages rape culture and normalizes the idea that sexual assault is something that can be as inconsequential as beating an enemy team or player, etc... \r\nI am all for free speech but just because we have it doesn&#039;t mean we don&#039;t have consequences for what we say. \r\n\r\nTLDR: I think it would be very beneficial for Riot and for the League community at large if there were to be an official Riot PSA concerning hate speech and rape culture. \r\n\r\nThanks for your time.\r\n\r\n-n00bsauce13","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-12-17T18:59:58.392+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's understandable to take a stance against using the term \"rape\" in this context, but I think it's really pushing it to suggest it in any way normalizes sexual assault on any level.\n\nShould it be filtered as mature language?

I don't agree that it should, but it is undoubtedly a negative term so I don't think it's out of the question to suggest it could be a reportable offense.

I agree with you though, that rape should never really be taken as light fun. I've already had to deal with one friend who got raped, and it was easily one of the hardest things I had to go through when I was still a high school sophomore, while she was a senior. So, I don't like using rape as a form of joking, or any form of euphemism. \n\nThough, it is common knowledge to many that joking about rape is frowned upon in all forms of society. It makes the person using it look heartless and probably won't look well upon others around them. It really depends on a person as well. If someone is against rape and they have a pretty good reason for it (i.e. the person was actually raped, hence why they are against it), then by all means, they have a right to be offended. I haven't been raped at all, but I have had to deal with it, and it's never a pretty sight, so I'm against it.\n\nThough, you're really preaching to the choir. I'm sure a lot of people on this forum are against it, and probably would call someone out for it in real life. Though, even with the PSA from Riot, people in this community will STILL joke about it, will still ensure that others will be miserable. That's just how some parts of this community are. It wouldn't really do much if Riot made a PSA about it, unless they took action, but even then, there would be a community backlash or something like that if it did happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlueBilberry","date":"2016-12-17T21:16:49.344+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I sympathize with your feelings.

It and fuck are synonyms when using the correct meaning.  What you need to do is see these words, which are spelt the same, as different from one another given their meanings.  When rape refers to nonconsensual sex it is pretty darn offensive, and very few people would claim otherwise, but it's hardly offensive when describing being one shot by Veigar.

The meanings, and thereby the intent behind the use of the word, is what makes a word or phrase report worthy.
