However, his R is just.. plain underwhelming. We were all hyped up for a powerful ult, that could do MASSIVE damages. What happened instead? We got a completely weak and useless ult, that does a lot LESS damage than the past. Another part, he could actually screw over his own team with his R. Also;He can't escape with his R as easily anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Terminatoast","date":"2017-05-05T23:38:16.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"his q makes jungling alot easier since it is a free stun on the strong creeps. he is the easiest jungler right now, not having to activate a single health pod while taking every camp, he doesnt need more health regen than that.\nif you call an ult that is easy to hit and can easily turn a fight or even a game around useless, then i dont know what you want from zac.\nHe is NOT supposed to be a full ap bruiser mage but a cc heavy supporting tank, that can engage fights and take out damage dealers. \nIf you screw over your team with his new ult that is entirely your own fault. you beeing bad doesnt make the char bad.\nJust dont play him full ap and expect to kill the entire enemy team and you are fine...","replies":[{"poster":"FloofySheep","date":"2017-05-06T15:14:19.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course he isn't. But his regen was what defined him.  I played him full tank, and as a bruiser.  He had the damage to be able to do this, and was still able to be killed by fast moving targets. However, his R truly did lose a large amount of Damage and if you add in the fact that he lost the blobs he could have gotten from his ult, then he loses even more damage.  Already, his R lost 60% of its damage, and now only drops 1 blob, regardless of how many people you hit.  Second, his Q's cooldown. I'd much prefer the old one if the cooldown for his current Q is a short tug, and a 11 second wait at level 1.  It slows him down considerably.  His QW combo was a defining feature that let him hit well, as well as regening much faster.  The point of his Q's low cooldown in the past meant that he could spam it, and allow his W a faster cooldown time. However, with the longer cooldown, he loses about 1 W more than before.  Now, I haven't messed up with his ult yet. It could be useful, but he lost so much damage, that it sometimes isn't worth it. He still takes damage in the flattened form, drops 1 blob, and could be messed up on complete accident on no fault of our own.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tykune","date":"2017-05-05T00:50:11.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, did you just say that Maokai's ult leaves little room for error?\n\nFucking LOL.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/mlIl53phyhc","replies":[{"poster":"boggletap","date":"2017-05-05T01:05:15.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's actually pretty nice that they split up his ult into 5 pieces. the video even shows this, yasuo windwall only blocks one piece of it. whereas a nami ult just disappears if it even grazes a windwall or braum shield. a sej ult bola would just disappear at a windwall too","replies":[]}]}]}
