From [Understanding the Tribunal](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2726400): \n\n>**1) What's the point of having a language filter if I can get banned for 'adult' language?**\na) We aren't out to punish players who use adult language; in fact, very few players are ever banned for saying stuff like \"f***, I missed that skill shot\" or \"damn, f***ing close game!\" However, the language filter is not an excuse to verbally abuse someone in the game. When you verbally abuse or harass someone by calling them \"f***ing ******\" or \"n*gger noob\", that's when you've crossed the line and will be punished by the Tribunal. I've said this before and I'll say it again, we aren't trying to clean online games of adult language; we're trying to reform or get rid of jerks who like to verbally abuse and harass other players.\n\nWhile it is certainly frustrating to play with/against people who just only care about themselves and no one else, yelling and raging at them isn't gonna magically get them to stop. Either kill them with kindness or just stay silent.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MaropaL2","date":"2017-01-23T00:19:25.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are still ppl who take blind pick seriously? :D \nBlind pick is the official troll mode of this Game as anyone can go anywhere.
