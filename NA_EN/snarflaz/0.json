I Usually go lots of  armor items against an AD top lanes it doesn't really work out well because he'll beat me out with lifesteal. Most Top lane bulls like Darius, Olaf, fiora Have lifesteal. If i trade with them they'll heal up with minions. I was thinking maybe a Blade of Ruin King or Triforce might be a good damage item early. Any opinions about this?","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-03-21T20:50:49.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I go {{item:3068}} first, everytime. He needs it for waveclear, and dueling power.\n\nAfter that, there are five offensive items you can choose from: {{item:3091}}  {{item:3153}}  {{item:3078}}  {{item:3087}}  {{item:3074}} \n\n{{item:3091}} Suffers from an awful build path, so I would only buy it if you have someone on your team who can benefit from the shred, and you can build it all in one go. Riot said they plan to change the buildpath, so this may change.\n\n{{item:3153}} This item is probably you're best bet in most situations. If you get this, then go full tank, you become an amazing duelist. However, if there are no tanks on the enemy team, there are better options.\n\n{{item:3078}}  and {{item:3087}} This is a very offensive combo, can can work wonders if you are ahead. It gives you the power to actually assassinate carries if you can taunt them. You'll actually feel like a ninja! Be very careful with this, you need to be A: Ahead, and B: Have alot of cc / another tank on your team who can peel. Shen's job is usually to peel, this build puts you in the role of an initiator. This also gives you great splitpushing power.\n\n {{item:3078}} This item without shiv can be very strong, but overall is outclassed by bork. Can be a good solo pick up if against squishy targets. Keep in mind trinity will give you 100 extra on your ult.\n\n{{item:3074}} I have never built this on shen myself, as I do not feel it is better than any of the items listed above. However, it is popular on him, so it might be worth buying. It gives good split pushing potential, and more AoE damage, but shen doesn't do much damage without different items listed above... Be careful with this one.\n\nKeep in mind that you are still a tank. The trinity/Shiv combo is the only exception to the \"Only get one offensive item\" rule.\n\nAlways build {{item:3068}} or {{item:3065}} (Against AP's) first. After that, pick up your offensive item (If you are not really far behind), and then tank up.\n\nFlat HP gives shen very good heals for his team on his Q, and more damage for his passive.  {{item:3075}} is also excellent. \n\nThis is for toplane shen, if you are in the jungle, get CinderHulk, and go full tank. {{item:3075}}, Cinderhulk, and smite gromp. That gives you more than enough damage, believe me.","replies":[{"poster":"Snarflaz","date":"2015-03-21T20:54:10.581+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the tips!!

Learn the different match ups, and learn when the best time to pick your champion is. \n\n{{champion:98}} is niche, and should not always be picked, so keep that in mind. Certain matchups/comps will destroy him. And if you need a damage dealer on your team, I wouldn't pick him either. But those are things you will learn in time after playing a champion enough.\n\nEdit: you are welcome tho!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Phuc Dat Bich","date":"2015-03-21T20:43:06.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"shen sucks stop play shen simple as that","replies":[{"poster":"Snarflaz","date":"2015-03-21T20:46:14.460+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"And his ult is pretty useful for saving peoples life.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Snarflaz","date":"2015-03-21T20:45:50.369+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought he would be a good tank since he can taunt the whole team and make them focus him instead of the adc and mage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Snarflaz","date":"2015-03-21T20:49:42.409+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think maybe a triforce will work since it adds Attack speed extra magic damage and HP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hasztalan2","date":"2015-03-21T23:07:29.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No. Shen allways gets a corresponding defensive item first , and THEN follows up with a major dmg item, which is Bork 99% of the time.\n\nSo if u have ad opponent: Sunfire-Bork\nIf u have ap opponent: spirit visage-bork.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LoRdJeSuS6969420","date":"2015-03-21T21:10:51.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would never recommend going full tank on any champion--always include at least one damage item in your build.  It's best to balance it out, since you get diminishing returns for building only defensively--that one last warmogs isn't going to make that big of a difference (maybe makes you live like 15% longer?), but getting a triforce and effectively doubling your damage the whole time you're alive will have a much bigger impact.","replies":[{"poster":"Toothierosprey3","date":"2015-03-21T21:23:10.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some champs can go full tank, like Rammus.
