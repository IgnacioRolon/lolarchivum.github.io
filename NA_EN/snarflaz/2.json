Her Q does so much damage early and late game. It gains more damage as it travels? Wtf, all nid does is stay back and poke with Q, it's slow traveling but you can't dodge it all day. You will eventually get sidetracked on something. When she hits it she goes cougar form and does over half your health. You throw a spear and it can do 500 damage to most mages.\r\n\r\nI know what you are thinking, Build MR. I tried that but it doesn't work it still does too much damage. All i want is a Q nerf. Remove the scaling damage as it further travels.","replies":[{"poster":"TotalJerk","date":"2015-02-17T00:19:32.608+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"People would always ask why there are no ranged AD junglers.

I can deal with Nidalee in lane. But her having a safe laning phase where where has 5 chances to get fed no thank you. Especially when she gets even more control over dragon and baron. On top of this she can set a trap in order to get a MS boost when running into the lane for a gank. At least in lane you have a chance to see the spears coming and then a jungler to shut her down. In the jungle its a giant guessing game of where she is going to be and even as J4 with mobi boots I have struggled to keep up with her ganks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jofeyy","date":"2015-02-17T16:51:08.780+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe an increase in  spear mana cost per use ala kogmaw or kassidin","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitz n The Fool","date":"2015-02-17T17:02:15.983+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Its not her spears that are the problem.

It does so much damage at lvl 1. I know it's a very slow projectile but it's bound to hit sometimes. Nidalee is the most annoying champ in my opinion. You go back and come back to lane and all of a sudden she hits a spear that makes your health drop to half in 1 shot. Then when you wanna farm she pounces your ass, and kills you. You can gank her but.... what am i saying you CAN'T gank her.

Assuming she has 40 AP, she is healing for 65 hp at the cost of 60 mana. \n\nNow, imagine you are against a Xerath. His Q deals 80 + 75% AP, which is equal to 110 dmg with 40 AP. If Nida has 30 magic resist, the actual damage taken is 85.  So basically Xerath is doinng 20 dmg per Q if Nidalee heals each time. Why is this frustrating? Because Nidalee can dodge Xerath's Q, but you can't make Nidalee miss her heal.","replies":[{"poster":"Spookzie","date":"2015-02-19T01:11:59.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still don't see what you're trying to tell me.
