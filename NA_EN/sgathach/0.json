I woke up to update league and its new patch but now its just calculating differences and counting files. Then an error occurred and it had to restart the counting again.\r\n\r\nI just want to get into game for a bit, buy some stuff, watch people play. Is there nothing I can do to help fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-18T20:03:09.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you get the error specifically when the patcher is counting files, it is possible that this is some sort of OS Permissions issue.  Essentially, the patcher is trying to scan the installation trying to find any missing or corrupted files.  If your OS blocks or stops this for any reason, this error message would pop up.  In an effort to rule this out as a possible root cause, make sure to complete all of the steps in our [Permissions Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104).  Some of the steps there are fairly simple, but they are crucial in hopefully resolving it.\n\nLet me know if you are still experiencing the same issue!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stevish","date":"2016-05-18T19:49:53.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yip I'm getting same thing. I don't know why they don't at least let users know that they know or are working on it. I have seen problems likes this come and\ngo and they never seem to care to respond. It bothers me that I can't play when I want but not that bad. I feel sorry for those that spend money on this game\nand get no answer or notice when things go wrong lol.. My money is safely in my pocket :)","replies":[]}]}
