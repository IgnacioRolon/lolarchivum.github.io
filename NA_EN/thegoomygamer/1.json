As soon as Ileft the game I rejoined (as in clicked on the reconnect button as soon as it appeared) but I somehow got a leaverbuster after that. Why? It was less than a minute I was gone for. I reconnected ASAP. How does that warrant a leaverbuster?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-01T19:13:56.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ai vs Coop is still a matchmade game, so even if you are against bots there are still real players on your team.

Evidently they were wrong.","replies":[]}]}]}
