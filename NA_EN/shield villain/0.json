They essentially butchered the lore of a handful of champions for a half baked idea, then decided to go back and retcon summoners before they had even fixed their first mistake, destroying yet more lore in the process, and making the quotes, lore, and identity of champions become nothing but jibber jabber.\r\n\r\nSona still calls me summoner, so does Cho&#039;gath. But apperantly I don&#039;t exist anymore. Lee Sin&#039;s entire identity revolves around Summoners, and he still has that lore up. But it&#039;s not even cannon anymore. So what gives?\r\n\r\nAgain, the event was good, but who are we trying to kid? A week and a half for months worth of constant bull shit isn&#039;t fixing anything. It&#039;s a step in the right direction, but god knows how many times the lore team has done that and immediately dove right back into the shit and muk we cried out against\r\n\r\nLore team, I still think you&#039;re dead. If this is all your months of &quot;planning&quot; has bore, then I don&#039;t want anymore events. I just want my favorite champions to have some lore that is actually relevant to their identities. As far as I&#039;m conerned, the Lore Team hasn&#039;t been doing their job for a long time now, and this event is nothing more than a meager attempt to make it seem like they are doing what they&#039;re being paid to do.\r\n\r\nYou know, we joked for a time about how Lee Sin was never going to be nerfed, but despite that he got the worst nerf of them all. His Identity was removed from him.  Riot, plx, reconsider your way of doing things. How is Lee Sin going to make anymore LCS BIG PLAYS without his lore?","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2015-08-01T11:22:30.660+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's a step in the right direction.

They just claim to have done so and people go along with them, allowing them to get away with claiming flasehoods of their own lore and not follow up on their claims.\n\nIf they've *retconned* the Summoners, The IoW, the game itself, and the non-lore setting doesn't include those, then what does it include? What about the world? How was a new rune war prevented? or wasn't it, and why hasn't that blown the setting up yet?\n\nClaiming that \"everything's the same except the setting details we can't be bothered to get a basic grasp of\" isn't retconning. You have to actually say what's happened instead of a (in theory atleast) neutral institution being set up to police MMD (Magic of Mass Destruction) usage, and provide an alternative conflict resolution method to potentially world-ending wars.\n\nJust saying everything's different now isn't enough. You've gotta say how everything's different.\n\nSo far all they've done is expand on the old lore, remove a lot of stuff, and rework some of the more out there champions.\n\nBut they haven't actually gone contrary to their setting.\n\nThey just stopped referencing it.\n\nSo I atleast don't forgve them for not giving us closure.\n\n(I also don't forgive them from doing the stupid \"retcon\" thing in the first place, because League's Lore is what i've been wanting out of a game the last 6-ish years, but that's just me. I also feel they really ought to give Factions a community spotlight.)\n\nWe should definatively not forgive them for not knowing their own lore, and basing major shifts in the direction of storytelling on easily recognized factual errors about their own story (AKA. Either they lied us straight in the face or they're utterly incompetent at their job).","replies":[{"poster":"Mimaropa","date":"2015-08-02T00:40:51.097+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"In a different perspective, I think riot is OK with the lore.\n\nRiot did destroy old lore but the new lore were summoners don't exist is better. It gives me a bigger world vibe and not focused on the summoners rift. \n\nLore does take a lot of work. Making up a good non generic story takes time. They have to brainstorm a lot and give a champion a unique personality and identity. I like what they did to miss fortune. She's not just a slutty bounty hunter,it goes deeper.\n\nThe story does have a lot of plot holes but riot will eventually seal them up. It takes time. I think riot is releasing new lores by bundle in events. Its better and more organized than giving a piece one by one. After all it makes events even better and more interesting.\n\nIn a business perspective, riot will release incomplete stories to keep us for wanting more. Riot gives us incentives to keep in touch with the game and making events that generate income. I do want LoL to last 15 years or more. Its like one of those TV series styles where every episode ends with a cliffhanger or new information that leaves us with questions or wanting more. I do want more about what will miss fortune do next or tf and graves are a romantic couple but that's for the next bigewater event. I expect to be more bilgewater events in a few years.\n\nI think eventually in the next few years, riot will have gotten over all the factions/countries by then and I don't want the lore to just stop there. Its not as short as waiting for the next episode of game of thrones but it is as enjoyable. \n\nI think it's just me, I have a lot of patience and I try to understand and not judge people. Anyways LoL is a FREE game, I don't expect them to earn a lot of money but they do release great stuff like Music and new champions. Just be patient or ask Tahm kench so he can satisfy your hunger for lore :3","replies":[{"poster":"NorthernDruid","date":"2015-08-02T02:01:43.523+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"They didn't retcon the setting. They removed it.\n\nAnd part fo their reasons for doing it were blatant factual errors.\n\nDon't forgive them for being awful at their job or lying to your face.\n\nAnd don't say it's ok to leave the setting hanging for a year.\n\nThe old lore was focused on an entire world, with an ongoing plot (also, way to leave out the other Fields of Justice, shame on you). The story was centered on the game and driven by it because, hey, it's lore for a video game that's the natural state of things.\n\nThe new lore where summoner's don't exist simply doesn't exist because they removed the setting and any ties to the game.\n\nAnd that's when it stops being lore for a video game and starts being a random collection of short stories, no matter of glossing over it on their part, lying to our faces about their own story (or just not knowing their own story in the most incompetent way possible), or being pampered by people who clearly didn't know the old lore really well at all either.\n\nNone of that will change the fact that they said they were gonna do a bunch of stuff, that a bunch of stuff was now the case. And then left it there for the next almost year (and counting).\n\nThe bilgewater event takes place in their new, non-lore, game-unrelated AU, and it's hyprcitical of them to let their spinoff stories influence the game in any way, because the entire premise was that tying the game and the story together was too constraining and difficult.\n\nThe story they're telling, isn't League of Legends' story, it isn't the same story they were telling before in any aspect, it doesn't actually have any grand setting-wide plot holes because there is no grand setting because no such thing has been detailed yet for the last soon-gonna-be-a-year that they've had to release a pretty simple run-down of here's what's changed and here's what's the same and here's how everything happened instead.\n\n---\n\nThey're not telling the story of a world and it's major players, with a fairly unique and even somewhat innovative premise. They're telling the stories of a bunch of fantasy stereotypes doing mostly cliche fantasy things.\n\nThe rebirth of Shurima is a really cool story to set in a world where you are provide ongoing tidbits about the state of politics.\n\nIt's rather shallow as the end of a story about raiding a tomb and unleashing evils (and a good or two) sealed in a can in the most cliche manner possible.\n\nAnd for all you might cry and Riot's storytellers might claim that there's gonna be more Shurima stuff coming and that last year's even was just the beginning of Shurima's story. It's been almost a year, which is a fairly long time to ask someone to wait for a story to move on from its prologue. It's also a really long time to take in laying down some really basic setting details (like what about the rune wars? why isn't Valoran blown up by the next one when the IoW and the LoL isn't created to prevent that from happening? What about Noxus' invasion of Ionia, how does that happen when they're not safe from Demacia invading them? How does it play out when Ionia can't halt it by joining the League? Did Kalamanda happen? How did it happen? or did it not happen and Skarner is just a generic monster scorpion tomb guardian now?) There's a lot of questions which is not something they can take their sweet time telling through youtube shorts and huge yearly events. A lot of these things are stuff they had to answer right away to have the right to a tiny shred of respect from their customers, and it's been a year (almost).\n\nAnd the most important thing to answer after retconing the League out of it's own lore: What is the League of Legends?\n\nAnd that is the one thing i'm confident won't be answered for years until they forget some really simple fact about their story (or just no longer like it) or just simply wanna tell a different one and decide to scrap everything and start over with a new 180 turn in direction.\n\nI'm sure we'll get more stories from Riot Games. Just as i'm sure that none of them will be relevant to their game, even if they'll use some of the same characters in non-game incarnations.\n\nIt'll not be lore. Lore is something which expands on and explores facets of the world belonging to a video game. The new story, thoroughly disconnected from the game in an attempt to act more professionally, is not Lore.\n\nAnyone saying otherwise is (intentionally or not) decieving you.\n\n---\n\nFor what it's worth, what little of the new story material i've read i've thoroughly enjoyed. Sion's little segment, Kalista's video, the Harrowing video, Bard's champion reveal video, Ekko's champion reveal video, Ekko's random comic, Tahm Kench's champion reveal video, and even what little of the Bligewater event stuff I could be bothered to read before losing interest and moving on to a real fantasy book i'm currently reading.\n\nI've liked it all, and loved some of it. Sion's stuff, Ekko's video and Tahm's Video are really really great.\n\nThey're just meaningless out of their own little existance because there's no setting to tie them to, and no actual connection to the game they're created for.\n\nI've stopped playing league now, finally (atl east trying to), because while I love playing, I hate the game.\n\nI was bait-and-switched, came for the story and great character design, but stayed mostly because I realised the story was excactly what I'd been dreaming for in a video game story... except much more in-depthly so.\n\nAnd then they took that away for mostly flimsy and some objectively bad/wrong reasons, and it's caused me so much mental stress and sleep-rythm disruption over the last almost year.\n\nI hate the game now, and I hate it's creators. Most of all I hate the storytellers, not as people (I'm sure they're great people, at least that's my impression from the red posts i've seen), but as professionals. Because their work is causing me pain, stress and nothing else.\n\nThere's so many other things I could do with my time. Like read up on the lore of a game I'l be playing in for the next year, a game with actual setting.\n\n---\n\nP.S. This is why you shouldn't make long replies at me. Also why I shouldn't be replying in them iddle of the night.\n\nP.P.S. To any reds: At least give Factions a thorough community spotlight before you remove the rest of the lore, it's well deserved. More so than any other community project I can think of, because this is lore-continuation(so fan-art and fan-fiction I guess), game-mode and community engagement all in one.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nilok","date":"2015-08-01T11:36:33.732+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"An interesting note is that the lore team has shifted a bit.\nWhen Shurima was released, the old Narrative Lead was leaving and sent the whole thing into quite a bit of confusion.\n\nWith this, we have a new Narrative Lead, Graham McNeill, who worked on Warhammer 40k around 4th edition, and has been a novelist for the franchise until 2014.\n\nI found the story so far more interesting then the Shruima event, and it explained more of the world around the characters as they interacted with it. I can promise you, it was not an accident that TF ended up running around Bilgewater like he did, it was a way for the writer to show the interesting features of the city by pulling them into the story and being experienced the characters.

The Bilgewater event was awesome, that Ekko comic amazing. But it still feels like too little. I can understand you guys wanting to try and set standards, but it's coming a little too slow.\n\nWhen I first started playing League I was seriously overwhelmed by the amount of characters and the differing play styles and abilities. How was I going to pick mains if I had to try out all 115 of them and find the right one while learning the core mechanics? It was rough, but then one day I opened up the Lore tab and it became a million times easier.\n\nI was drawn to characters through their stories, became interested in new champions through their individual stories. it helped me feel like they were actual characters and unique to themselves. And sure, the stories weren't always award winning tales, but they were interesting and helped me to picture them not only within the game, but outside it.\n\nThat yellow guy who shoots light became Ezreal the Prodigal Explorer. Purple ssassin's creed rip off guy, Talon the Blade's Shadow, whom is easily my favorite champ today. Being able to go back and look up cannon stories, his background, and see what he's like really helped me to piece together what kind of person he was, and thus want to play him more. Lore is crucial to a game with so many pieces. \n\nWhich is why I felt destroyed when I saw that Ezreal's lore was reduced to nothing, A character I had become invested in suddenly didn't seem to fit the bill he had paid before.

This is simply not the case.  There are years worth of grievances left unaddressed and this current batch of lore, while a step in the right direction, is but a drop in the bucket to address them all.  \n\n1.  There are 126 champions currently in League of Legends, each with a need for a unique, long format background story (or lore).

There is a huge inconsistency within the department on how they handle these bios already.  When Ekko was released, the team said that they didn't believe that it was necessary to have champions closely tied to other champs in their bios (Ekko x Vi or Jinx).

This lore team clearly does \"grim-dark\" really well, as seen through their changes with Miss Fortune's story. But... can they do whimsical?  Can they do heroic?  Can they do horrific?  Can they do noble?  Can they do any of the other emotions that these champions engender besides \"grim-dark?\"  We'll have to wait and see, won't we?\n6.  We don't know what our collective reaction will be when Narrative botches one of these new format bios (and odds are they will).  We also don't know what Jaredan and the rest of Narrative will do in response.  Are they really willing to go back to the drawing board and fix what they got wrong?  Are they going to pull the \"we think we're right and we need to move on to other stories, so your thoughts don't matter anymore\" card some at ChampUp have been using?  We just don't know, do we?\n\nSo, no, Narrative are taking some positive steps in their handling of this story, but we're not at the point of \"forgiveness.\" They have a long way to go and I think they know it.
