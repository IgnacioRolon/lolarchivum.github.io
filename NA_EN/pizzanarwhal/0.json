I have chests available apparently and I have keys. But when I go to the \"crafting\" section on League of Legends I cannot open any chests, even though it says I have them available and I haven't opened them on any of my champions. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the chest system, but from what I think I understand, I SHOULD be able to open at least one chest...help?\n\nhttp://imgur.com/5MySOf1\nhttp://imgur.com/BN6oy5B\nhttp://imgur.com/XwXl1eS","replies":[{"poster":"Nixdorn","date":"2016-07-08T02:18:18.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chests available means that you can get that amount of chests so on the picture you can get 4 chests!","replies":[{"poster":"PizzaNarwhal","date":"2016-07-08T17:03:43.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you!

It looks like you're eligible for earning Hextech chests, however you don't currently own any. You're able to earn up to 4 chests per month, which your screenshot shows all 4 are still available. Since you already have keys, once you nab a chest, you'll be able to open it right away. You can find out more about the Hextech crafting system on our [Hextech Crafting Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide).\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"PizzaNarwhal","date":"2016-07-08T17:03:19.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, thank you (: that makes more sense!","replies":[]}]}]}
