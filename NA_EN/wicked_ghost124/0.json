It can result in first blood + bush control for your team, which can be game changing especially in unfavorable matchups.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lumus Avatar","date":"2016-11-27T07:41:21.211+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope it does get reconsidered. I'm not sure I see the logic in leaving this feature out when clarity and fluidity and customizablility are values readily held by Riot. \n\nThe unending frustration of having to search for the item you want each time you play a champ just because someone at Riot doesn't recommend that item for this champ...Being able to set up item lists for each champ made it so you could have everything you needed for your personal way of playing a champ at your finger tips at a moment's notice without having to type it in search or manual narrow the filter to the item you want.\n\nIt just doesn't make sense to suddenly remove this feature.","replies":[{"poster":"Zallamance","date":"2016-12-01T03:32:23.908+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I remember correctly, Item sets were a very simple program that just got slapped into the Legacy client and then never got touched again. Riot has probably not bothered much with it since it was released as there were a lot more issues and goals to deal with at the time. Since the client got completely re-done, the basic and simple Item set program is no longer compatible and they'll need to make a new one from scratch but, yet again, they are swamped with things that need to be done atm. \n\nOnce everything is in a better state and the client comes outta beta, I think they'll have a bit more leeway to put manpower into the less important side projects. Ie: Item sets.\n\nIf I'm wrong though, someone please let me know, I'm also very interested about when we can see Item sets in the new client.","replies":[{"poster":"Altonius Amakiir","date":"2016-12-01T07:15:02.283+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I know, you are absolutely correct, however it wouldn't hurt to at least say something like: \"Hey guys, we aren't going to put it in until after the client is out of beta, and even then it might be two or three months, maybe more before it gets high on our priority list.\" In my opinion that would be enough of a comment. I may not like having to wait or be particularly happy about a comment like that, but its better than checking the boards for an update, commenting to try to convince them, asking/looking for their reasoning, all with no response. It's really annoying to read people's concerns and questions about the decision only to see a two sentence response about championify, or spouting out an unconformable stat about the usage of it that no one seems to think is even close to the actual numbers.\n\nI understand their reasoning on a technical side of things, but as for how this coincides with their supposed values, how the decision could adversely affect the game, and how they don't seem to even try to address people's concerns(except for two responses I saw) I don't understand. I just want them to communicate with us on this at the very least.","replies":[{"poster":"Zallamance","date":"2016-12-02T03:08:55.558+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, brace yourself for this:\n\nTrue, even a simple comment would help clear the air and shed some light on the subject, but if you look at Rioter Targons Blade's comment, it was posted the same day as this thread opened up and his comment is essentially exactly what kind of feedback you'd be wanting. I doubt we will see any new's what-so-ever about Item Sets on the front-page until they come to a decision and start to work on it. I believe they talked about this awhile back, but saying anything more than \"it's being considered for the future\" starts to set up expectations and when situations arise and things are pushed back, the player base starts to get upset, feeling like they were lied to or their voice falls on deaf ears. \n\nImagine if they said item sets would be available shortly after the beta aired. Most people would be thinking a week or two at most, and expect that to be the time-frame. Then the beta comes out and all hell breaks lose. The client is crashing, ranked is shutdown, logins are unsuccessful, legacy client won't run, frame rate issue's, people can't purchase RP, client is lagging, Windows 10, servers are down, PBE isn't working, and then you have a group of player's who are already upset because of all the issues being listed above demanding Riot to be loyal to their values. And just to add some more foresight into this, what does Riot do now? They have a mountain of problems, limited staff and now they have to prioritise. Ignore Item Set comments and players get demoralised because their words truly are falling on deaf ears. Say that they are being post-poned and Riot get's told they are liars and are forgetting their roots. Actually send staff to solve the complaints and other players who can't even the play the game because of game-breaking issues will see that Item Sets are being worked on instead of their problems and probably straight up quit. There is no solution, no matter what players are going to be mad and angry, all because of one optimistic comment. \n\nAnd to really push this all the way, everyone seems to forget (I'm guilty of this too) that these are people, not just some faceless machine that we are talking to. They love the game as much as we do and guaranteed. a bunch want Item Sets to be implemented too. But now they're stressed out at the enormous amount of obstacles placed in front of them, most likely working off of a couple hours of sleep and caffeine around the clock in order to try and minimise the unhappiness that is occurring while the fan-base is barraging them with questions and comments and are getting upset at the lack of responses, leading to more stress. \n\nYes, I know that  this whole comment is very hypothetical and rather exaggerated, but end of the day, there is a reason why Riot does and say's what it does, and if we can take a step back and try to see things from their perspective, League as a whole can become a lot healthier.\n\nBut seriously, someone msg me as soon as there is some news about Item Sets.","replies":[{"poster":"Altonius Amakiir","date":"2016-12-02T06:23:06.981+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah they have reasons, and there isn't a clear way to make people happy. They already responded a bunch to comments and questions, the problem is that they never actually answered anyone, they just kept saying things like there are third party, we are re-looking at our decision. They would almost never say, \"Hey, that is a valid concern, we will consider that\" or \"We don't think that will be an issue\". They would just spit our these simplistic replies that never even addressed what the original post was concerned about specifically. I can see how their time might be precious, but if they are going to use that time to respond in the first place, they should make those responses actually address the community's concerns, comments, and questions, not brush them off in this weird manner. \n\nThese posts are just as worthy as bug problems with the new update, yeah they should be making sure that they are addressing bug fixes first and foremost, but there aren't that many posts in the client discussion anymore, so no one can justify this by saying they are busy replying to other more important things. Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but don't they have a specific team that's job is only to reply to these, so them replying isn't going to slow down the client update.\n\nGoing back to what you said about problems arising on launch, that's all the more reason to respond now when it is fairly calm, that way they don't have people angry then that they never actually addressed this.","replies":[{"poster":"Zallamance","date":"2016-12-03T00:46:41.727+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, when they comment, even if it's just to say they are re-looking into a decision, they are showing acknowledgement of the issue. We could assume that any Rioter comment addressing a concern means that the concern is valid and it wouldn't be much of a stretch. Also, their replies have to be simplistic, otherwise is sets up assumptions by the player community and could really backfire. I know it gets worded strangely, but 100-1 odds if Riot responds, it means that specific comment has caught their eye and is in need/deserves a response; they're not really brushing you off when they respond.\n\nI haven't really been checking the client discussion so I have no idea if that is holding most of their attention, but there could be just as problematic issues happening that we arn't even aware of yet and that are set to a high priority. On the other hand, they might actually be working on item sets as we speak and just don't want to say anything until they've got a guarantee on it working, I don't know what they're doing.\n\nI honestly don't know if they have a specific team for replying. They probably do I would imagine. But if things are really hectic right now, communication between different teams could be low. Furthermore, I know that if I was working on, let's say, the programming team and I'm having a game-breaking issue that requires me to stay in contact and get feedback with the development team, the play-test team and the animation team, an email from the Boards Response team asking about when item sets are gonna happen would be a low priority. And tbh, it would probably be a low priority for the Board Response team to send it too.\n\nI agree, things have calmed down tremendously from when the beta launched, but that's only from the issues we the players could actively see, and as I said, for all we know, they are working on it and it could be out tomorrow. Time to just prod a little bit here and there, see if we can get a sit-rep and wait.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FreshRebirth","date":"2017-04-28T07:31:07.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Targons Blade,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=iyBFEJzU,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-11-20T23:56:03.624+0000)\n>\n> Item Sets weren&#x27;t a feature that made it to the Beta Client.

Please change this decision.  I, as i am sure many others, do enjoy and rely on the item-set ability.  Not only does this eliminate the standard use of every-day MOBA builds that everyone uses, it allows a freedom of customization for everyone who even remotely dabbles in it, something your Rune's and mastery pages do not (as these also fall into the standard everyone uses the same build).  One of the only flaws i can express in this game are the lack of customization and elements of unique play-style which exist in this game, the only reason this is countered is because of the large expansive champion selection, Item Sets circumvented this.  \n\nIn addition you are removing a key strategic element of the game, time.  By removing item selection you are adding to the amount of time we as players have to spend in the store.  Even as someone who mains a specific champ and knows the item build by heart you are still going to have to manually navigate to each item you purchase, this adds seconds to the game that you're spent item browsing.  These seconds will quickly add up and as a cumulative game, the seconds for each summoner will turn into minutes, a lot can be done in minutes in this game.  Now to circumvent this, many novice players will hit \"B\" then start to browse on the spot, taking their eyes off the game and allowing for easy picks from unsuspecting predators.  \n\nThis is my drawn-out plea for you to overturn the decision to allow item sets in the new client; i've attempted my best at adding value and actual argumentative reasoning behind my post, rather than the standard \"bring it back rito!!!!\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wicked Ghost124","date":"2016-11-27T16:27:41.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks guys, I guess I need to use paper writing to do my item set","replies":[]}]}
