I am not in any way saying bard doesnt need a few buffs. Because he does. What I am saying though, is that he isnt a  troll pick. He isnt SO BAD that you should want to report, or harass people for picking him.  He needs a little more to help his team with, since he can really hurt his team too. \n\nJust a few personal buffs id like to see on him:\n\nHis passive movespeed boost while out of combat, is increased to 10 seconds, from 7. This will help him get meeps, and then get back to lane, without leaving his adc hanging for too long. Thus hurting his team less.\n\nQ: the slow/stun should be the way it is honestly. I know there is a lot of controversy about it being extremely hard to land, and not doing much if you miss. But trying to buff it in any way makes it feel like it would be too strong.\n\nW: Cost is actually fine, bard collects meeps, and generally never runs out of mana anyways. This being said however, the charge up time is way too much. 10 seconds is an eternity in league, lower it from 10 to 8 seconds to charge, and also make it give a third  of the health as bonus mana. Im not sure how I can word this, but lets say bard's shrine gives you 75 HP, I would like for it to also give you  25 mana on top of that 75 HP.\n\nE: I feel this ability is great as it is. Very cool, very new, and allows for some interesting plays, that we would NEVER see before bard.\n\nR: the infamous team killer... I think its super weird how the enemy team can see where its going to land, even if its fired from very far away. it should work more like ziggs' ult where the area of effect is only visible to enemies for a brief time before they are hit.

You play Bard, you wreck with him, you go make every player on Summoner's Rift fear the meeps.\n> \n> Kick some ass for me.\n\nThis is how I feel. I bought {{champion:432}} when he first came out because I like champions that are (apparently) versatile like Rek'Sai being, yes, a jungle beast, but a decent mid / top laner as well if played by someone who can swing it. I thought Bard's E would be jg heaven considering the only other junglers with that type of long-range gap closing ability are {{champion:33}} and {{champion:421}}  both of which their **_team mates_** can't also take advantage of said gap -closer. \n\nNow, It's not like I'm saying Bard is a great jungler, top laner, mid, or support in the way that more traditional roles are but he can do a bit of damage with meeps building {{item:3115}} , {{item:3078}} , and {{item:3025}} which are items that you typically won't have the luxury to build as a support but can wreck with in other role. \n\nHis ult? Well, yea, it can screw a lot of stuff up. I played {{champion:432}} recently this week while {{champion:238}} is F2P, so there was an enemy {{champion:238}} and a friendly {{champion:238}} and so many squishies to protect that as soon as I'd see (or hear) Zed trigger his ult, I'd ult the person getting ulted. \n\nWell, apparently every time the other Zed ulted, **our** Zed would ult their Zed or nearest squishy and my ult would cancel out both of theirs which (lead to probably both of them) raging. It's something you have to get a feel for and honestly it's not an ult that you're just counting down the seconds for it to come up so you can engage or disengage. It's more like an \"as needed\" thing, whether to catch an enemy or objective and hold them for a few seconds so your team can catch up or yourself/ team against a {{champion:30}} ,{{champion:55}}  ,{{champion:119}} ,{{champion:81}} ,{{champion:115}} ult if you plan it and stay clumped. \n\nAll this aside, {{champion:432}} is a strong champ. The pros have said he is strong and his utility and map-dominance can be unparalleled if the game works in his favor. Which basically means he's been able to roam and collect enough chimes so A.  his auto-attacks hit like a MAC truck and do AoE damage (around 45 chimes) and B. He's been able to collect chimes to replenish the mana he's used in lane which will allow him to possibly assists / gank other lanes. Chimes give experience too, so there's your two incentives for roaming. {{champion:432}} can't win a game if he can't roam and his team doesn't dominate the map objective-wise. Keep in mind those win-rate stats come from all ELO's which most players are between the Bronze and Silver level and **Bard has a higher success rate in games that last around 35 minutes at least. ** He's a lot of fun to play but you have to commit to his playstyle. He's definitely not a casual pick that will have great synergy with any ADC or team-comp. He's a champ that requires your team to have enough synergy and understanding / communication to execute well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Loveless","date":"2015-05-02T04:20:34.425+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's justified","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Queen Viper","date":"2015-05-02T14:36:32.734+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"No? \n\nHe's really bad and useless when compared to other supports.

Those that don't fear the Raka are most likely ignorant of her power not because they haven't faced a Raka before, but because they haven't actually noticed her make the difference in a match.  \n\nShe's pretty subtle and unless you know what to look for, it's easy to dismiss her as a terrible pick.  Despite this, it's priceless to go up against a team whose been conditioned to \"focus the ADC\" and nothing else.  I'm throwing sparkles at Graves for 360+ HP and they refuse to switch targets.

The only way Bard can ever truly fuck his team is with a bad Ult, and that's something real Bard players won't do very often. \n\nHonestly I feel like Bard's been out long enough to where most people playing him are fairly confident they know how to make plays with him. But _EVERYONE_ who doesn't play Bard just dismisses him as worthless because they don't know what he does. (Pro tip: this is true of the enemy team too, use this to your advantage, teams with Bard.)\n\nBut to the earlier point, playing Bard is sometimes awful for the Bard player because teammates don't know what to do.\n\nIt's like: \"Hey I know we're teamfighting so lemme just clutch heal you and give you that movespeed boost to chase them down for that last AA.....or you could run away...that's cool I guess.\"\n\nOr: \"I'm in the jungle collecting chimes, Oh shit they dived us? I'ma E through the jungle from a million miles away and land a perfect Q that stuns two enemies....and y'all disengage leaving me to die...(except I don't because Bard's movespeed is OP.)\"\n\nOr: \"Ally ADC low health getting chased down, Ult the person chasing them and stand there ready to Insta-Q them against a wall and drop a heal on the ADC, and....you blow all your mobility running away...that's cool not like the two of us could kill a stunlocked enemy or anything. Next time I'll just use my ult like you use Zhonya's, to delay your inevitable death for 2.5 more seconds.\"\n\nOr: \"Enemy is low health and headed for the safety of their turret...ult the turret and drop an E that comes out of the other side of it, take the E to either secure the kill or heal anyone who dived too slowly, and die to the enemy because nobody followed up on my ult OR my E.\"\n\nBard's allies have no idea how useful he is in fights, and neither do his enemies. He can sustain pretty well and turn the tide without too much difficulty. But as long as allies only see him as a disengage tool, he'll never win games.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Arcade Andrew","date":"2015-05-02T07:14:18.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the only problem with bard is when the chimes spawn in ridiculous locations around the map (which I generally predicted when they let us know how his kit worked)\n\nI kid you not Ive had a game where at least 10-15 chimes spawned inside the enemy base within the first 30 minutes of the game,\n\none time I had my first chime spawn right under the enemy bot turret\n\nbard wouldnt be so bad if they realized that maybe JUST MAYBE a full map roaming support was a terrible idea, and then introducing a cool fun champion then screwing him over by making his only good thing on him his one downfall , screwed him over real good\n\nTLDR: the chime spawn rates/ and locations are purely based on luck and determine if youlll do good as bard or not","replies":[{"poster":"kile147","date":"2015-05-02T09:30:10.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They've improved that spawning behavior in this patch, guaranteeing that for the first 5 mins at least no chimes will spawn in enemy territory.

With only a bit of coordination, he gives incredible utility to his team, and with his passive he does actually pack a bit of a punch.\n\nHis main problem is that his heal is really weak for how long it takes to charge. Sure, a full three-heal cluster is really good burst heal, but that needs to be set up far in advance, so his potential good heals are severely conditional.\n\nIf you could have more shrines out at once, or if it healed for max/missing hp as well (scaling up with the charging), then he'd be in a really good spot, even if you fail to collect enough chimes or your teammates decide to ignore your portals to safety.\n\nOn top of all that, maybe the difference between fully charged and half-charged would be noticeable enough for people to stop picking up half-charged heals when we're not in a hurry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Troll Detected","date":"2015-05-02T12:47:32.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your post wont help.
