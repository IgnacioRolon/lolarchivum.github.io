I had two players on my team last game that pretty much gave up because we had a Bard on our team with [me] Gangplank Jungle.  I was able to rally our troops to victory with Gangplank's E, despite being behind, and we won the game with some good teamplay, despite them having a Zed, and a Gold Janna.","replies":[{"poster":"Terff","date":"2015-05-03T00:09:09.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HE'S GOAT!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-05-03T00:07:51.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wut.
