I can't do it anymore. If you don't play one of the top 3 jungles, it's so unrewarding to even attempt jungle anymore.

Every one of these junglers got indirectly nerfed by the smite range decrease and they put forth so much effort to engage. So I just started playing {{champion:254}} and win.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Delta F508","date":"2015-02-25T15:03:12.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Now I may be wrong, but I feel like a Jungle Main would just find another champion to play?
