Champions move slowly and then suddenly speed up and teleport to where they were supposed to be normally. The time is bugging out too, sometimes the seconds go slower which makes for example the jungle creeps spawn at about 1.30.\n\nTried repairing the client but it didn't help, what can I do to fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-26T21:39:45.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your connection to the game server may be unstable.
