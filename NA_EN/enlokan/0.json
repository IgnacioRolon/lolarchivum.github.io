They might even not have the same name back then. So much questions ! \r\n\r\nSo I would like to know if there is authors that are keen to answers these kind of questions, or if it is a taboo of some sort. \r\n\r\n\r\nHere is some random questions I have, maybe some of them have been answered (in this case throw a link to my face)\r\n\r\nWhat does the name of each voidborn means? \r\nWe got a while ago a not about the name of Vel'Koz said to mean \"Understand by destroying\" (I don't have the exact english translation~) and its name came from the Icathian language. \r\nSo I came to think that all voidborn names had a meaning in Icathian tongue. \r\nQuite recently we had the signification of Kha'Zix name which is \"Facing Yourself\". Name given by the Rengar's tribe (\" Kilash\" tribe?) which is known to live in Shurima, so their tongue could look like Icathian without problem I guess. \r\nSo what does Cho'Gath, Rek'Sai and Kog'Maw significate? \r\n\r\n\r\n2) (Void again) How many of each voidborn exist?\r\n\r\nWe know that Vel'Koz is the first of the watchers, so that, even if he's the most ancient one, he isn't unique. Same thing for Rek'Sai which is the queen of the Xer'Sai. Can we ask ourselves if there is different version of Cho'Gat for example?\r\n\r\n3) What the hell Ryze??? (LUX COMIC SPOILER)\r\n \r\nIn Ryze cinematic we see him hide 4 world rune in the root of a petricite tree. \r\nLater in Lux's comics we learn that petricite doesn't erase magic but absorbs and STOCKS IT.\r\nAccording of the power of the world rune, does Sylas could make Demacia explode if he would walk into these woods? This one is a bit far-fetched but hey. \r\n\r\n\r\n4) LUX COMIC SPOILER (Again)\r\n\r\nThe Lux's comics was super cool and added a lot of depth to the Marie Sue's of Demacia.\r\nAnd the writer kept the death of the death of the king kinda casual.\r\nWe know he didn't die from the hand of Sylas himself, so who killed the king? One of the mage rebels? \r\nSeriously, we don't know the name of the person who killed the FREAKIN' KING OF DEMACIA without a trace of blood and behind a closed door ?!\r\n\r\n\r\n5) Who are the stars Ahri hold in her hands?\r\n\r\nI mean, there is a blue, a green, and a yellow star-stone. \r\nI'm not sure but these things gives the impression of something really important, to me it's the essence of deceased star guardians. \r\nBut eeehhhhh…? The three partners Ahri lost doesn't match these stars. I mean… well the Green one could be Rakan (even so he seems to have kept his essence as we can see in its skin recall) and none of Xayah and Neeko are blue. \r\nKof, and Neeko isn't even dead. \r\nIf we go a little bit further (and far fetched), we could say that the yellow one is Neeko in her prestige form (and she lost her essence and regressed to a weaker form...?)\r\nAnd maybe, maaaaybe since Rakan still have his star, the green one is Xayah's.\r\nAnd the blue one is Zoe's before she got corrupted? Be she… seems to be a real meanie. \r\nWell it's not making so much sense but I haven't found anything better. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, I have been long enough, I still have a thousand questions. If you could just tell me where are the answers or who I have to kidnap to get them it will be great.\r\n\r\nOtherwise I would be happy to discuss theory !","replies":[{"poster":"Hunkmenlordy","date":"2019-09-22T16:25:20.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What's useless lore questons? lolz","replies":[{"poster":"Enlokan","date":"2019-09-22T17:08:09.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well what a call an useless question is things that won't ever be answered by Riot.\n\nBy comparaison you can for example pick \"Who are the 2 remaining Darkins?

Treat these carefully, especially when speculating. \n \n----\n\nSometimes, there is no answer but a lot of fuel for speculation, so I'll try my best to come up with some answers.\n\n1. Darkin\nI don't know what they were as Ascended and there is no real evidence or hints for anything so I'll go with your guess, it's as good as any.\nHowever I'm pretty sure they did not change names when turning into the Darkin. More likely is that they took their current name when they ascended, and kept it since.\n\n2. Voidborn\nThe names are given in ancient shuriman as Icathia was destroyed. (It might have been the same language, but then it would still be called shuriman.)\n\"Sai\" means desert, look at \"The Great Sai\" on the map. \"Xer\" means \"little devil\" ([Source](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/f2tgimyd-something-interesting-about-the-shuriman-language?comment=001a) and it also describes Sai and other names).\nSo the Xer'Sai are literally \"Devils of the Desert\" while Rek'Sai probably means something like Queen of the Desert or something like that.\n\n3. Voidborn again\nMost voidborn die pretty soon, so even if there were more of them when they spawned (don't want to say \"were born\" here), they most likely died.\nThis is what sets the champions apart from other voidborn: All champions are impressive, the strongest, best of their kind or unique in other ways. \nThis is why I would say they all are unique (not counting Xer'Sai btw).\nThere might have been others with the same concept (knowledge, growth, evolution) but they would never be exact copies of Vel'Koz, Cho'Gath or Kha'Zix.\n\n3. Petricite\nYes, the spot Ryze chose is not as safe as it looked. \nSylas blowing up Demacia seems unlikely, as it's certainly not going to happen in a story. Maybe he could, but I think the question is irrelevant.\n\n4. The King\nI think that was intentional and will be covered later.\nKeep in mind that most people in Demacia \"know\" that Sylas did it, even if we know he didn't. No one was there when he said it except for Jarvan, who obviously didn't believe it.\n\n5. Star Guardian Gems\nThese are indeed the gems of Xayah, Rakan and Neeko.\nAt the time of the battle, I assume they had different colors:\n\n * Rakan: Blue\n * Xayah: Green\n * Neeko: Yellow/Golden\n\nNeeko faked her death with a clone, so the gem can be broken even if she's still alive.\nXayah and Rakan then changed colors due to the connection to each other and also Zoe's corruption. To be honest, this release messed with the color theory a bit.\n----\nSome english words you were looking for are \"Ascended\" instead of \"Transcended\", and Vel'Koz name means \"to understand by unmaking\" iirc.\nI could still easily understand what you meant, just pointing out the correct translations.","replies":[{"poster":"Enlokan","date":"2019-09-22T21:25:19.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I was afraid so...\n\n1 ) It's stated in Aatrox story (not the bio) that the darkin were ascended (thanks).

When SG Rakan gets his Q heal he get his purified form back for a moment and he's pretty much green too (also Xayah too when she recalls). I'm not convinced they would change color before changing color again with corruption.\nAs you say everything leads to a potentialy different pool of champion chosen to be SG that hasb een changed after all and the color palette wasn't good anymore.
