No bit laner with even a quarter of a brain pushes the first wave unless there's been a lane swap and you intends to deny farm to some one without wave clear or under tower farming ability.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SecondChanceHero","date":"2014-11-11T03:09:22.806+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> \"Don't freeze lane, we'll lose exp\". - pro Gold Morgana support using W on Minion waves.\n\nWhat?!??
