Before i updated to the new version, everything was going fine. but after i updated to new version, I found out that the client goes very slow, and when i go to normal game, the game will freeze that looks like stop between client to the loading screen. After that, even though i can login game, but the FPS will drop hardly when i face to other champions. I used GTX1070, and i just confused why and how?\r\ni have already re-install the windows, but it's still not working.\r\n\r\nHelp me out guys!\r\n\r\nThank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-14T15:10:04.648+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might also be experiencing problems with outdated drivers or game file issues that can cause sudden fps drops.

It's kind like random drop. For example, I set the FPS is 80. It's fine when the game starts. However, when i face to champions, and doing cs, the FPS will drop randomly. I am confused how can i fix this bug? i was fine before 6.20.\n\nthanks","replies":[]}]}]}
