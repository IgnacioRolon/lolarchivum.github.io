Now this has happened quite a lot in the past too, but it&#039;s especially noticeable this time with a couple of the new ones looking grainy or low resolution, rather than just artistically distasteful.  Crimson Akali comes to mind, with her new art&#039;s face looking a bit pixelated on the loading screen, and Vindicator Vayne is a bit blurry, in addition to having a different facial shape from normal-Vayne and not being recognizable as the same character anymore if not for the armament.  Just thought it warranted attention, as far as presenting very sub-par artwork goes, especially when the art that both examples replaced was already rather good.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-06-02T12:40:53.486+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's probably because the only \"new\" splash arts released recently have been the evelyn base, tristana splashes, nid splashes and trundle touch ups.
