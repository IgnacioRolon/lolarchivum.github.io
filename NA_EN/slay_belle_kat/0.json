It started yesterday, when the practice tool recently came on the live servers, and since I chose not to install the new client and have always played on the legacy client, I tried re-downloading league so I can, well, try the practice tool. Then, when i re-downloaded it, my client just won't load and it said something like \"leagueoflegends.ux file has been corrupted\" or something like that and it would automatically close it. I've tried launching some anti-virus scanners to detect a problem, but there seemingly weren't any. Then i tried re-downloading league of legends again, and now I \"could\" launch the client, but when I enter my log in data, it just loads up this black thing in the middle of the screen and my legacy client won't load. Any ideas how to fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-16T03:26:00.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like this could be caused by a few different things. The first step I recommend taking is launching League from the **lol.launcher.admin.exe** file as admin (r-click, *run as administrator*) from inside your installation directory (C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends). If you see the same blank screen after trying the admin launch, let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Slay Belle Kat","date":"2017-02-16T15:04:19.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I deeply appologize for wasting your time, i tried re-installing it once more and this time the delete was succesfull and now it works, but i accidentally chose not to download the alpha league client xD. Is there a way I can re-download it without uninstalling everything?
