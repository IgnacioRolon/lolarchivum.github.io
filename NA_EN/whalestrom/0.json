In Graves&#039; default skin and his other skins, reloading his gun resulted in an animation to show that graves was reloading. However, in the skin &quot;Hired Gun Graves&quot;, Graves will only perform his reloading animation if he fires BOTH shots. If he only fires one shot, he obtains a new shell but does perform the animation. TLDR; Hired gun graves is missing his reload animation if he only fires one shot.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Ranger XIV","date":"2016-01-07T22:24:57.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Whalestorm!\n\nI worked on the Marksman project and I want to say thanks for bringing this to my attention.\nI looked into it and ya, having that skin be the only one that doesn't have that animation feels pretty bad. I definitely do not want you to have to deal with that when you play with that skin. I am working with the designer to get that fix in as soon as we can. It won't be in 6.1 but we will have it out soon!\n\nThanks again for taking the time to post :)\n\nRanger XIV","replies":[]}]}
