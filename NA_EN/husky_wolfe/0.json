Idk maybe i'm downloading the client from the wrong place but can you make it so that when you click Play the Game from Leagueoflegends.com you actually download the new client right from the launcher, and not have to go through all that extra downloading and hassle? Idk maybe its just me{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]}
