Her kit was ridiculously powerful, so a bad passive made sense. Currently, Zyra doesn't have that level of power anymore. Her kit when played proper is indeed still strong, but it doesn't even compare to the power she once had; therefore, I think her passive is long overdue for some changes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Malicious Fury","date":"2015-09-09T02:52:17.522+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:26}} 's passive is the most useless.

Her passive will still be terrible because you will rarely ever kill anyone with it. Maybe get a kill with it once per game, if even that? It simply does too little damage and is too hard to land for this kind of change to be meaningful.","replies":[{"poster":"Rundus1","date":"2015-09-10T21:48:18.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While it might not be the most meaningful, it's still a buff and a good place to start.  Since it literally only gives her more power, it's a buff.  At the same time, more work could be done, but this would make her passive much more unique.  Simply put, she'd be able to get dove on, ult/root the diver in her team, and even if she dies she just has to last hit (or maybe even just hit them and they die within x amount of time) and she's back and ready to keep casting.  Being as backline as she is, a mechanic for controlling where the seed lands might be needed, but since Zyra as a whole isn't all that terribly weak, she shouldn't expect too much in the buff department.  And if the passive doesn't do enough damage, add variables to increase it.  Maybe she sucks the life from nearby plants, gaining +15% damage on passive hit per plant or something.  I could totally see that being helpful.  Either way, she doesn't need too much more power, it's mainly just her passive that sucks, and that would make it not suck so much.  It'd already outclass Zac's in most cases where the enemy just murders his blobs, Zyra can deal damage and still have a chance at coming back.  Plus, I'd argue that worst passive in the game would possibly be Taric's.  It'd be good with a few tweaks, but on its own it rarely accomplishes much of anything.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Water Breathing","date":"2015-09-09T03:03:14.329+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Azir has no passive on Dominion, can we just let that sink in for moment? lol","replies":[{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2015-09-09T05:08:51.204+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, he did, but then Riot took out the attack speed from CDR.
