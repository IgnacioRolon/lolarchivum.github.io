Not jusst assasins but adc as well\r\nNow considering that riot is against abusing an item ,  is this not such a case ? I mean if every ad champ builds a certain item even if it is to be used from another category of champions would that mean it needs some work so that specific champs ( those who the item was made ) get to buy it ? Or am i wrong ?\r\n\r\nThank you for your answers","replies":[{"poster":"Fullmetallic","date":"2018-07-10T16:44:51.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What ADC can use duskblade?? kaisa + vayne invis is not enough for it to come up, I believe","replies":[{"poster":"SugeMinPikk","date":"2018-07-10T16:47:07.291+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's core on MF.","replies":[{"poster":"Fullmetallic","date":"2018-07-10T16:54:59.721+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SugeMinPikk,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QJ1jHcBd,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2018-07-10T16:47:07.291+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s core on MF.\n\nForgot about her, my bad.\nBUT BESIDES THAT.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Xavanic","date":"2018-07-10T16:58:09.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Càptain Bone,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QJ1jHcBd,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2018-07-10T16:44:51.009+0000)\n>\n> What ADC can use duskblade?? kaisa + vayne invis is not enough for it to come up, I believe\n\nVayne is, kai sa isnt","replies":[{"poster":"Fullmetallic","date":"2018-07-10T17:03:05.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Xavanic,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QJ1jHcBd,comment-id=00040001,timestamp=2018-07-10T16:58:09.263+0000)\n>\n> Vayne is, kai sa isnt\n\nEvery vayne I've seen autoes nearly instantly after her tumble, and only stays invis for the full second if theyre trying to run away.","replies":[{"poster":"Xavanic","date":"2018-07-10T20:52:02.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Càptain Bone,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QJ1jHcBd,comment-id=000400010000,timestamp=2018-07-10T17:03:05.973+0000)\n>\n> Every vayne I&#x27;ve seen autoes nearly instantly after her tumble, and only stays invis for the full second if theyre trying to run away.\n\ntrue, but her invis still lasts long enough","replies":[{"poster":"Fullmetallic","date":"2018-07-10T22:33:05.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Xavanic,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QJ1jHcBd,comment-id=0004000100000000,timestamp=2018-07-10T20:52:02.943+0000)\n>\n> true, but her invis still lasts long enough\n\nTrue","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FCJAAAAGOOOO","date":"2018-07-10T16:41:24.539+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.)
