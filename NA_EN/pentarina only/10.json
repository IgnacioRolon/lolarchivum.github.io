You can't compare these stats to a voidstaff! It may give only 60 AP but the passive MR reduction gives you more damage, even more since you most likely rush this item and early flat pen is pretty good, not only that but 60 MR is quite a lot.\n\nEDIT: just to add that it's one of the best items you can rush against AP Fizz, this will stop him from 100-0 you.","replies":[{"poster":"Pentarina Only","date":"2016-06-08T20:45:28.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> EDIT: just to add that it's one of the best items you can rush against AP Fizz, _**this will stop him from 100-0 you.**_\n\nhttp://memesvault.com/wp-content/uploads/Laughing-Hard-Meme-10.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-06-08T20:54:12.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well it'll stop him the first time at least.
