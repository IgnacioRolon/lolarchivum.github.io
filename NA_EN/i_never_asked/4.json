The fun ended until my client \"stopped working.\" So then i re-logged and played. After the match i played a few games without crashing. Then when i was playing a normal i crashed again(stopped working). So i re-logged again and played. After that i  played another game with my friend and Skyped with him. After champ select and the game starts to load . I suddenly wasnt loading. I tried alt-tabbing, but no loading. My friend had loaded in but i didnt. For a few minutes in, my teammates decide remake. Meanwhile my client was not working. Then the game had ended and I'm now in low priority queue. I exited out and repaired my client. So does anyone have a solution to my problem? Please i need help!! Thanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-02T22:42:22.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your client is disconnecting from the game platform.
