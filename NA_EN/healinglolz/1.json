What sucks about that being his end-game role? What would you like his power curve or late game role to look like? And what's missing from allowing that to happen that wouldn't just boost his already-strong early game?\n\nI'll throw my two cents in. I used to play a LOT of Pantheon, but stopped in Season 4, around when Kha'Zix fell out of favor.\n\nHe's very perplexing, as a champion. He plays like a 'light fighter'; according to his playstyle, I'd say he's a tankier version of champions like Riven, Yasuo, and Fiora - Very fast and very mobile, but he trades sustained damage for extra tankiness, while retaining burst. He's a champion who didn't really benefit from the Black Cleaver rework. Brutalizer is a perfect rush item, but Youmuu's isn't that great on him.\n\nI think this stems from the fact that Pantheon was built to be an Assassin. Assassin was his old tag, rather than Fighter, and I think his kit may have been based around that. His tag got changed based not on changes to him, but on how people were building him. He, imo, would have been a much better champion for the Juggernaut reworks than Skarner.\n\nHis auto attacks aren't really that effective, since he's going to be channeling Heartseeker Strike and casting Spear Shot most of the time. This makes items like Bloodthirster and Ravenous Hydra less effective on him, because he doesn't AA much. That said, there aren't that many items he can build. Black Cleaver used to be a mainstay, but that got changed. Last Whisper is good, but he often lacks the AD to back it up. I see some build Manamune/Muramana, to help his mana issues, but he stacks tear extremely slowly. I think, with Pantheon, it's more of an itemization issue than a champion issue. I think Dead Man's Plate may help him a bit (Now I want to go try that...), as will Sterak's Gage. Not Titanic Hydra, though.\n\nSo, yeah. He's perplexing. if I were to change him... I would rework him. Visually as well. But, in the absence of that, I'd lower his mana costs, on his W and E. Not on his Q, so he can't just spam Spear Shot ALL day without pots. A higher base Mana pool would help, too. Lower the channel time on his ult - I remember there was a big proposed change to his ult a while back, significantly reducing the range and cast time. I think something similar, but just with a _small _ cast time reduction (I'm talking .5 seconds here), would be good. They can nerf the damage on it too, no one uses it for it's damage, and in taking away some of that power, he can be given some elsewhere.\n\nHere's a thought... What if his E applied on-hit effects? This would essentially make it a replacement component for his AA's. He gains the benefit of increased damage and range while channeling, but loses his ability to move (And maybe also loses the ability to block attacks with his passive while channeling?). It would make him benefit MUCH more from Life Steal, and open him up to items like Blade of the Ruined King and Wit's End. He would still be rewarded for leveling Q first, since it does more damage by itself, and have E leveled by the time he has 1 & 1/2 on-hit items completed.\n\nOne last thing I'd like to talk about is his fantasy. When I think of Pantheon, I think of a warrior, but a different sort than, say, Olaf or Darius or Sion. Pantheon has a cool head, so, if he were reworked, he wouldn't have any 'rage' themes. He's a soldier, but a soldier in an army of warriors. He's fast and agile, but his shield permits him to be durable. He can fight an army of average soldiers almost on his own. I'd say he'd fit perfectly into the Juggernaut role, as one that trades some tankiness for increased mobility. He also serves as a potential point of religious worship in LoL, which is something that is very absent. He could worship the Sun, since the Solari lead the Rakkoran people, and disdain the Lunari. There's also potential for stories where he believes the Solari have become decadent and complacent (Perhaps the Solari have the finest foods on all of Mount Targon, while the Rakkoran commonfolk are suffering from food shortage), and begins to doubt his faith, maybe even coming into conflict with his childhood friend, Leona.","replies":[{"poster":"healinglolz","date":"2015-08-13T22:32:28.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great idea, will be interesting to see this new E and the lower mana costs/base mana increase will be great aswell :) And about the ult it must be 2 sec jump 1,5 fall, but currently it is bugged and both \"phases\" are taking 2 sec each!
