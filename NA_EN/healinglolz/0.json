(When mana drops to 50%, add mana equal to a certain percent of damage dealt. This would be shown in gray mana for clarity and have a cooldown long enough to only be used once every teamfight)\n\nThe issue I see with this item, especially when it comes to manamune synergy is that this is an item that you want by midgame but can only build in late game. Hence the suggestion that I've seen around to create a new in between item that just has the mana regen portion and maybe some armor pen would be great. You can take away the lifesteal. One could sit on that in between item until it was time to finish it for the BF and extra damage late game.","replies":[]}]}
