The people that aren&#x27;t complaining about urf not being fun are having fun playing urf.\n\nYes actually. I find it funny that there are people who wanted it so badly that Riot did something about it to appease them. And maybe not this person, maybe not even most people, but several of the people who wanted URF to be permanent can see that it has already lost a good portion of it's luster. It is still fun in my opinion. I just got done playing it and I had a blast. It has lost a lot of it's appeal to me too however. I was actually told just last game I played that I can't play a character in the jungle because, \n\n*\"There is no jungle in URF\"*\n\nMy response to this was, \n\n*\"There is no meta in URF\"*\n\nAnd there isn't, but people are beginning to adopt one, and that makes it less fun. They then continued to whine about how I lost them the game. I continued to not care, ... actually, because they were whining. It is meant to be fun. Yes, winning tends to be more fun, but the fact that I 'had to be top, or gg' doesn't make the game any fun in my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"Kubox","date":"2016-05-22T00:13:47.795+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Let's be honest here, you going jungle is not necessarily fair to the one guy who has to 2v1. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with going jungle if you explain it to others right as the game starts or play with at least a friend or two, one covering the 2v1. At least this way the \"2v1 guy\" can pick a heavy wave clear champion and tough it out.\n\nBut if you just pick smite, go jungle and force a guy to deal with a 2v1 he didn't ask for, you're no better than the guy who won't support in Blind pick and goes double jungle.\n\nAnd there is a meta for URF, don't say otherwise. It's simply looser than the normal SR meta. The moment OP champions were found for URF that either got them perma banned by players, banned by riot themselves (and then nerfed in URF), the meta was formed.","replies":[{"poster":"cuddlykitten4","date":"2016-05-24T17:52:07.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I WELCOME SUCH A CHALLENGE IN URF!!

They will always be completely broken until they are nerfed badly enough to make them unplayable, due to the combination of utility and mechanics they have. \n\nThis leaves players with two choices: either pick one of the few obnoxiously broken champions and join the tryharding, or have a miserable time (assuming level of skill is equal).\n\nWhen a mode meant to be purely for fun becomes infested with tryhards treating it like it's ranked, it's time to move on.
