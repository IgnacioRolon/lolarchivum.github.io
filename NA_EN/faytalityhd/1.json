Do champion abilities that reveal stealth still work or is it only pink wards that has been changed? It would defeat the purpose of re-balancing said assassins' around their stealth if they can still get revealed by other existing mechanics.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-10-11T03:14:47.336+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're still figuring that out.

Just if that's the case, some assassins are better off having their stealth left unchanged since against those particular champions that can reveal stealth, their overall power budget will be reduced to cater for the fact their stealth not being affected by pinks. \n\nAnd it could boil down to shifting more reliance on counterpicks in champ select if said champions that can reveal stealth become the only reliable way to replace pink wards. Currently right now everyone has access to pink wards revealing stealth, removing that ability to champions that cannot reveal stealth with one of their abilities could make champ select more bland when facing an enemy team of stealthers?\n\nI shouldn't be forced to use {{champion:64}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:117}} against an {{champion:84}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:29}}, etc. ","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-10-11T04:36:54.941+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed, excessively stronger counters in champ select's something we'd want to avoid. Current thinking is that that might mean use of more red trinket reveal effects than not, especially on really reliable abilities (Lee Sin E seems like a strong candidate for that). Full reveal by contrast might still be appropriate on either really windowed effects (TF ult say) or comparatively unreliable abilities (maybe Lee Sin Q?).","replies":[{"poster":"Hexten","date":"2016-10-11T08:42:07.021+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with your assessment, reliable abilities like PBAoEs such as Lee Sin's E or single-target point-and-click spells like Lulu's E should have something changed so that it is not true sight. \n\nUltimates such as TF's have long cooldowns so there is a play around here. Same with Lee Sin's Q, it is a skillshot so you can avoid it, so there is skill on both sides. It's fine if they are able to retain the true sight component.\n\nReally appreciate you replying. Provided a ton of clarity on this topic and good knowing that it is on the mind of Rioters.

To me Phosphorous Bomb is probably a better example of a less reliable ability, because it's not already massive overloaded in the same way as Sonic Wave. Seriously, Lee's Q already does like 15 things, does it really need all of them, especially when it's a really specific 'fuck you' to about 3 champions.\n\nThere's also the fact that Lee is a super generalist champ, so leaving him with stealth reveals really devalues stealth as a mechanic since you can expect to play VS him a lot. Comparatively Corki and TF (for example) are more nichey, there's times where they are worse picks and this sort of power on them gives a clear reason to pick them over Ez and A-Sol respectively.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Deckowner","date":"2016-10-11T03:29:31.113+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"he is really strong right now what are you talking about?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Adalore","date":"2016-10-11T00:06:23.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The biggest thing keeping him from a decent base winrate is that people are unwilling to build Rylias and are in a deathpact to RoA until it is removed from the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Lady Hammerlock","date":"2016-10-11T14:18:14.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Adalore,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=aOgKK5U3,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-10-11T00:06:23.862+0000)\n>\n> The biggest thing keeping him from a decent base winrate is that people are unwilling to build Rylias and are in a deathpact to RoA until it is removed from the game.\n\nOh my god trying to W after E without Rylai's is fucking torture","replies":[{"poster":"Adalore","date":"2016-10-11T23:38:53.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find myself starting the Stacks Ring (The name escapes me), going Tear and then B'line for Rylais.
