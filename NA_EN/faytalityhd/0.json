Please read carefully in light of what I got because of it.","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":2,"down_votes":31,"body":"Why do the good have to die young?\nSo I got permabanned for this. Its not nice by any means but it doesnt justify being permabanned. I got told to kill myself that Im garbage etc ( all of which are 100 times more severe than this). So riot go review this case to take at look at wht they wrote and tell me this is fair. Often they would tell me that we lose cos Im trash jungle which led me to reply that they got outclassed by their respective laners. ( sorry this isnt worth a permaban). I dont want to ruin other peoples games on other accounts smurfin if I have to its fine. If this was deserved I would accept it right away but its not as I said. I urge you to think about the implications of what I wrote, its no restriction its a permanent ban keep that in mind. So here it is. COmpare this to what other people write in your games, apart from 1 game this isnt that bad.\nSo Ima give some context too, because they way theyre doing this is very misleading and makes it look as though I was talking to no one here.\nGame 1 : While I admit its not nice its not worth a ban. Simply calling the enemy better than own laners isnt worth a permaban. In this game I got called &quot;retarded monkey&quot; and obviously blamed for the loss as a whole.\nGame 2 : In this game I had to play with an intentional feeder lol.... who kept telling me how worthless etc I was. I also was blamed for our mid dying 1v1 to which I said afterwards that it was in fact his fault ( really that bad an offense)\nGame 3: This is beyond me. The only toxic thing I see is 3 min but everyone had bascially agreed on surrendering and was afking in base except for 1 person. People write this ALL the time in my games only I dont report because I am no whiny person wanting to see others have their accounts taken away.\nOnce again this got punished with permanent ban @ riot this isnt fair for all I had to listen to when playing my games. Its only natural you react to countless offenses at times and I did in an acceptable fashion, no deaththreats, homophobic offenses or even direct offenses besides me criticizing their plays. ( happens all the time not just in game also life that you get notified about your mistakes cmon lol)\nIf this is the end then so be it maybe this can serve as a warning for those who arent aware of how little an offense can lead to this level of ban.\n* Edit , GAme 2s &quot; I am glad youre losing lp&quot; seems very toxic but I was playing with an Intfeeder who wanted me to lose my promo acting like he didnt care so I got somewhat mad.\nGame 1\nFaytalityHD: ye\nFaytalityHD: darius flash 19:45\nFaytalityHD: 11 : 400\nFaytalityHD: stop giving free kills\nFaytalityHD: those arent ganks\nFaytalityHD: theyre pickups\nFaytalityHD: well im not offered free kills\nFaytalityHD: always bot\nFaytalityHD: apparently not being bad makes me a monkey\nFaytalityHD: d5 logic\nFaytalityHD: wp\nFaytalityHD: cos of guys like u on my team\nFaytalityHD: hhh\nFaytalityHD: only care about kda\nFaytalityHD: wr is random\nFaytalityHD: god\nFaytalityHD: no\nFaytalityHD: im better than nid\nFaytalityHD: youre the difference\nFaytalityHD: y cos easy target\nFaytalityHD: funny cos you got solod initially\nFaytalityHD: 50 to 66\nFaytalityHD: this mid\nFaytalityHD: wow\nFaytalityHD: i guess we can ff if ekko e 1 shots 15 min in\nFaytalityHD: do you think youre better than ekko\nFaytalityHD: ?\nFaytalityHD: are you better than ekko?\nFaytalityHD: tell m\nFaytalityHD: thought so\nFaytalityHD: y cos we got no bot\nFaytalityHD: = free drake\nFaytalityHD: d5 iq god\nFaytalityHD: y cos youre\nFaytalityHD: xDDD\nFaytalityHD: y ofc i will lol\nFaytalityHD: nothing wrong with my play\nFaytalityHD: you got outclassed thats it\nFaytalityHD: you got outclassed by their bot\nFaytalityHD: happens\nFaytalityHD: youre losjng every time\nFaytalityHD: the times you dont its cos of all team winning\nFaytalityHD: stop playing bots maybe\nFaytalityHD: winning as jungler while having winning lanes is very easy bw\nFaytalityHD: btw\nFaytalityHD: ggwp bot\nFaytalityHD: outclassing ours by 2 tiers but we\nFaytalityHD: nice work mid too\nFaytalityHD: ahhh\nFaytalityHD: classic\nFaytalityHD: so fun and fair this matchmaking\nFaytalityHD: wanna tell me lux is of same skillevel as ekko lol\nFaytalityHD: good one\nFaytalityHD: xD\nFaytalityHD: losing teammate rng happens\nFaytalityHD: yasuo only one good\nFaytalityHD: god\nFaytalityHD: forgot to say\nFaytalityHD: they also managed to win easily\nFaytalityHD: without using any of their sums\nFaytalityHD: lol\nFaytalityHD: 1 8 combined\nFaytalityHD: maybe duo?\nFaytalityHD: oh 2\nFaytalityHD: wp\nFaytalityHD: promising\nFaytalityHD: yeah\nFaytalityHD: sad\nFaytalityHD: i know this game too well\nFaytalityHD: its all teammate rng\nFaytalityHD: when solo\nFaytalityHD: have good kda\nFaytalityHD: yea\nFaytalityHD: im used to getting 0 10 bots\nFaytalityHD: and high damage\nFaytalityHD: nice score\nFaytalityHD: and impact\nFaytalityHD: if i replace our bot with theirs i win\nFaytalityHD: get nid and you lose still\nFaytalityHD: gg bot rng\nFaytalityHD: pulled lucian unlucky\n\nGame 2\nFaytalityHD: he got skillshots you dont youll win easily\nFaytalityHD: lul\nFaytalityHD: asd\nFaytalityHD: youre fault 100%\nFaytalityHD: *your\nFaytalityHD: 2v2\nFaytalityHD: accept theyre better\nFaytalityHD: is what you can do\nFaytalityHD: elise carried bot\nFaytalityHD: well not as bad as\nFaytalityHD: you know\nFaytalityHD: our bot\nFaytalityHD: if you cant play vs raka its about time you ban her every game\nFaytalityHD: you act like theres no winning vs soraka\nFaytalityHD: xd but how does one get 2v2\nFaytalityHD: 1v3 probably abel to def\nFaytalityHD: 1 lane losing whole game\nFaytalityHD: as alwys\nFaytalityHD: no sum==\nFaytalityHD: xDDD\nFaytalityHD: lol @ 5 crits\nFaytalityHD: classic ez outplay\nFaytalityHD: find it funny that all it takes is manamune aa\nFaytalityHD: 1\nFaytalityHD: reproted offensive\nFaytalityHD: and your acc banned :)\nFaytalityHD: ggg\nFaytalityHD: glad youre losing lp\nFaytalityHD: ill make sure syou do\nFaytalityHD: dw\nFaytalityHD: ah k\nFaytalityHD: :/\nFaytalityHD: i love seeing you lose lp\nFaytalityHD: its what i play for\nFaytalityHD: cant 20 iq\nFaytalityHD: GG\nFaytalityHD: says the one who got solod by ez\nFaytalityHD: lul\nFaytalityHD: gg\n\nGame 3\nFaytalityHD: ok done\nFaytalityHD: AHAHAH nice cd lmao\nFaytalityHD: do you know what invis is\nFaytalityHD: 1v9\nFaytalityHD: report?\nFaytalityHD: why\nFaytalityHD: 3\nFaytalityHD: min\nFaytalityHD: y nice work bto\nFaytalityHD: wow\nFaytalityHD: doublelift\nFaytalityHD: report jinx asking for reports ggwp\nFaytalityHD: wow wp what is this lag\nFaytalityHD: drophack lol wp\nIf you want I can give detailed explanations to each sentence if it appears unreasonable without their comments added.\nI understand that this behavior is cocky etc but you would understand too if you were to see their comments. THis isnt fair and its whats been ruining the game experience for me. I see people calling others \"%%%s\" \"trash\" tards\" etc EVERY game and even then I dont report because I dont want them to share this fate ( its honestly the reason for me not reporting I know how flawed the auto ban system is and after all if I dont agree with it I shouldnt help it ban other players unjustly.)\nFrom reading these boards I know theres players who find their joy in receiving ban confirmations in game which again is beyond me. Unless its justified which mine is not why do you like seeing others suffer?\nI wish we had an actual tribunal back and my account would still be alive because its been reviewed by bots who instantly regard the reports as justified. I might have uncovered a huge flaw of the automatic report system which needs to be addressed immediately. When I say \"ez outplay\", it probably does count \"ez\" as a punishable offense although I was referring to Ezreal lol. This makes for extremely unjust results as proven here, please dont let me down riot and at least answer to this. I also got banned 2 minutes after finishing the last game. This is particularly sad because it proves that even this scope of action is taken by automatic bots who mistake Ez ( very common champ abbreviation ) for ez ( easy game) . Just sad. I also try to win every time I never troll unlike many of my teammates.  I played 2 nunu games but didnt mean to troll although my team immediately thought I was.

If someone is harassing you or using hate-speech, report them after the game. It does not give you free reign to harass them. Additionally, when someone is performing poorly, it is not your duty to tell them how bad they are.\n\nFrankly, I've never seen anyone with as many punishments as you on a single account before being perma-banned.

I even tracked 2 of their profiles and saw they had gotten banned. ONLY the very first contain the things you mentioned and the recent ones as I said dont contain ANY of it. Blame is something you have to deal with especially if you falsely accuse others for your mistakes.

Someone feeds, some teammate asks enemy team to report him after. Every single game but somehow they dont get any punishment. Now that you looked at mine thoroughly go look at their niceties. I wasnt given any extra chances, the ban level resets and I dont deny having actually harassed people at some point. the point is however, that this last most severe ban is completely uncalled for. If you find this unbearable you might as well quit life. I am not entirely sure but I think many people get fired based on poor performance so is their getting fired reasonable? Of course it is, performance is what matters and some of the most successful people are somewhat conceited.  Im repeating myself way too many times but you simply fail to see the point. You have to look at every ban individually and this one which as you can easily was handed out by bots, is a joke.

I have improved my behavior quite a bit when it comes to playing these games. I used to be actually offensive although relatively minor. In my last logs I actually found things I considered to be offensive which I stopped using after. Apparently, and I can unfortunately tell, players get banned solely based on the number of reports they get per game. They havent looked at this and I cant have triggered the bots by using offensive comments. Maybe I was especially at risk of triggering it by virtually anything and should have been told to NOT WRITE Anything in chat which I would have done had I know in advance. THis is just sad honestly. Theres a huge problem with players losing their games and then reporting their team ( espcially the jungler). If this person has written ANYTHING in chat hes doomed.

They dont even feel harassed they just love getting me banned. 100% deserved? Really? Do you actually play this game?
