Isn't he a Shiruman?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Many men have gone mad beneath the glare of the Shurima sun, but it was during the night's chilling embrace that Malzahar relinquished his sanity. Malzahar was born a seer, blessed with the gift of prophecy. His talent, though unrefined, promised to be one of Runeterra's greatest boons, but destiny plotted him another course; his sensitivity to the roiling tides of fate allowed other, unwelcome things to tug at his subconscious mind. In his dreams, where the veil of separation is thinnest, a sinister thing beckoned. For some time, Malzahar was able to resist its prodding solicitation, but with each passing night the voice grew louder, or perhaps deeper, until he could withstand the call no more.\r\n\r\nHe ventured into the desert without supplies, drawn by the lure of a specious charm. His destination: a lost civilization to the east, known to ancient texts as Icathia. Few believed such a place ever existed, and those who did were certain that the sands had long since devoured whatever remained. When Malzahar's cracked feet finally failed him, he found himself kneeling at the base of a bizarre crumbling obelisk. Beyond it lay the alien geometry of a ruined city and the giant decaying idols of dark and horrific gods. His eyes, seeing what others cannot, and what none should, were filled with the essence of the Void. His once shifting visions of the future were replaced with the immutable promise of Valoran beset by creatures of the Void. Standing alone, but not alone, amidst the echoing dunes, he noticed the familiar voice escape his own lips in a parched rasp, bearing three words whose weight trembled his knees: League of Legends. Now infused with the power of the Void itself, Malzahar set off to the north to seek his fate.\r\n\r\n''The land may melt, the sea may swell, the sky may fall... but They will come.''\r\n-- Malzahar\"\r\n\r\nI mean, I do understand that Malzahar is all about bringing the Void back and stuff like that. But he's still a Shiruman seer. Why was he overlooked? Why isn't he going to be playing a part in this event? Part of the reason I was so excited for Shiruma was the thought that Malzahar would get to play an important role, but instead you focused on Cassiopeia's involvement...which was welcome, I'm not going to lie, and very interesting, but still! What about the Shiruman void mage?","replies":[{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2014-09-16T22:41:37.046+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It get's a lot of people confused, but as far as i understoof it, the Shurima desert is actually bigger than the empire of the sands itself.\n\nIcathia lies to the far east. It is still inside the desert, but as servants of the void they were definitely outside of Azir's domain.\n\nThat's why Malzahar and Kassadin are not involved in the evetnt like Cassiopeia or Ezreal, who actually got their powers in the ruins of Shurima","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2014-09-17T15:44:38.684+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Indeed, the Shuriman empire once stretched far beyond the walls of its life-giving city. Many ruins are strewn across the massive desert as testament to the sprawling civilization that once existed.\n\nAs has been suggested by others in this thread, Malzahar's relation to the events of Shurima's return isn't as direct as the characters that are being featured.\n\nHe's around, he's just got his hands full.","replies":[{"poster":"Tiure","date":"2014-09-19T01:14:17.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright then. Malzahar has long been my favorite champ, but I've always been secretly dissatisfied with his lore. With the event, I was hoping to see a strengthening of Malz's identity besides the obvious and one-dimensional MAKE VOID HAPPEN.\n\nBut I guess we'll be getting that soon. Because of the mention of the League in his lore, one might almost say it is...inevitable.

They are just saving them for a future void event . Icathia ,the  ruins of city that used to be where the ancient mages  opened the void and where {{champion:90}}  and {{champion:38}}  got their void powers, is in shurima.

Icathia was build by the empire of Shurima but no one knows why and how it became a place connected to the void. Since they were able to create magic like the rite of ascension, they might as well be able to reach the void.\nIf you compare Malz to the ascended, there are some similarities and some serious differences. He seems like a character that went through an opposite of ascension, a descended being.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Season 9 Amumu","date":"2014-09-17T07:32:51.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe? he got his power from icathia in shurima, but it never states where hes from","replies":[]},{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2014-09-16T21:12:39.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as i know he might not be Shuriman, but he got called near Shurima hence he got his powers.\nProbably if he is Shuriman he just inhabits a city or village that survived the Ascension, so besides that he has no real bond with Azir and such.","replies":[]}]}
