Modifying files can also cause more problems than good, so your issue can be a combination of bad files.\n\nThis could also be due to driver issues that are outdated, so as a first step I recommend[ updating your graphics drivers](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+#wq2).  You may need to grab our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and run a clean reinstall for a fresh slate if that doesn't fix things up.  \n\nThere are a few steps here, but we need to rule out possibilities!  Let me know if your issue persists afterwards!","replies":[]}]}
