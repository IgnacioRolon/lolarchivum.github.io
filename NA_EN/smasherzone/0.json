Sometimes mine gets stuck so I end it via task manager then start it up again and it then launches fine. Also, is it actually a bad thing that you can’t play? It is kind of a pointless game lol. As far as pointless games go Battlefield 4 was the best one ever XD. I loved that game. I spent hours on op locker and on night Zavod. On Zavod strap C4 to your teams transport helicopter and whenever it takes off you see it 400 meters away hovering over Charlie and bravo then you detonate and it’s instantly flipped upside down falling to the earth. after that all you see is people jumping out for dear life and the pilot saying “sorry about that.” Ahhh, love that game a lot of times I’d just spend the entire game doing that lol, good times.","replies":[]}]}
