I cant ping, like when I press G, and stuff, the picture of the 4way ping table appears, but nothing will appear if I try to do a ping.\r\n2. When I click on the minimap, it doesnt go to that location, so I have to drag my map manually all the way to the location if I want to do something like teleport. So pretty much, the minimap I have currently has no functions besides just being a minimap, no expedited camera drags, etc.\r\nKeep in mind, this ONLY happens on my alt acc. My main is guuci.\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-11T21:54:17.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hyperion is on the right track in that there may be something wrong with your config that's preventing inputs from being read.  In addition, you may need to reset your config file to default to get this fixed up:\n\n **Log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nHopefully, that will get this fixed!","replies":[{"poster":"juju adventures","date":"2016-10-12T23:12:17.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I do this while im on my alt acc, will it affect anything on my main acc?
