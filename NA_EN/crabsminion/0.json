I was wondering how long this might take and also if there&#039;s any ways i can speed the process of getting my account back? is there more steps that i could take?","replies":[{"poster":"crabsminion","date":"2017-02-23T23:21:07.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just wish i knew if it'd be like 2 days or 2 weeks or 2 months. kind of annoying playing on lv 5 account lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-23T05:39:39.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't provide you an ETA on when you'll see a reply, since that changes all the time, depending on how many support tickets were submitted recently.
