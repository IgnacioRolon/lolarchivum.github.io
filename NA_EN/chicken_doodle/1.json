Let me tell you of how I got **LOWER PRIORITY QUEUE**. I was loading into a game of ranked, when it suddenly crashed. I received a \"bugsplat\" client telling me if I wanted to send the crash report to Rito. I clicked send. Here is the image of the webpage it pulled up: http://i.imgur.com/lEJ8mjf.png?1          After crashing, I saw a box in the Lol Client that says my client needs to be repaired. So, I waited while it was repairing, and this showed up not long after:http://i.imgur.com/X2PrMV5.png?1          I have not left but once because a friend of mine got mad and disconnected me(closing the game). I reconnected and proceeded to play *Ascension*. I kindly ask you (Riot) to do something about this. {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-28T23:35:16.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That really sucks that your game crashed due to a bugsplat, but those other teammates were still left to try and 4v5. I also wanted to check to see if perhaps this leaverbuster was given mistakenly, but it does look like there's recent history of AFK's which is why this leaverbuster was eventually placed.","replies":[{"poster":"chicken doodle","date":"2017-05-29T00:32:31.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, but why didn't it let me join back in?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-29T01:07:52.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may not have had the option to reconnect if the game had already ended or if someone initiated a /remake. You mentioned needing to wait for the repair to finish, so I'm guessing that match had probably already finished.","replies":[{"poster":"chicken doodle","date":"2017-05-30T14:29:15.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The repair was only for a few minutes, the game crashed upon getting into the loading screen.
