Examples: {{champion:57}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:516}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:33}} They are meant to be sources of crowd control that soak up enemy damage for their team, not boss level DPS bots that can solo-kill any lone target and need two or more enemies at a time to keep them under control.\n\nMarksman shouldn&#039;t be allowed to deal such consistent and _**massive**_ damage in an instant, they are a DPS class meant for whittling down targets from afar with steadily applied ranged attacks, they are NOT assassins that should be able to cheaply pick up ranged point and click burst with a ridiculously short self-lowering cooldown {{item:3094}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3031}} \n\nAssassins should be able to pop their targets with clever positioning and the skill to land all of their abilities on those targets, they SHOULDN&#039;T be able to do it in a single hit, two if the target built defensively, solely due to an absurdly cheap and overloaded item {{item:3147}} or thoughtlessly high base damage and scaling on easily landed basic abilities.\n\nFighters that aren&#039;t {{champion:102}} {{champion:5}} are meant to be a class that dives into fights in order to disrupt positioning and hopefully blitz down HVTs before they&#039;re able to use their abilities to turn a fight in their favor, instead the vast majority of them are completely outclassed by most tanks due to their lack of high damage while building pure defense to actually survive going after those targets. They&#039;re simply not able to reliably pick off those HVTs because they&#039;ll by default have more than enough distance and damage to pick that oversized mosquito off in no time because they&#039;ll most likely deal pitiful damage since they can&#039;t reliably live long enough to proc their PTA.\n\nMages are meant to be ranged spellcasters that control the flow of a fight over time with well placed abilities, instead they&#039;re played more like glorified chefs that all build practically identical full squishy damage with room for only TWO personal itemizations {{item:3151}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3165}} and roll their faces across their keyboards in the hopes of either killing an enemy before they die instead or at least burning most of the target&#039;s HP and Summs so their ADC can gorge themselves on the free gold with a skillful {{item:3094}} auto.\n\nAnd Supports? Supports are just enablers, that is their only job in this game, to enable busted champs with bonus item slots and effects, they have no real agency over the flow of the game on their own and rely solely on fluffing up the coattails of the over-tuned, and if the people in that role end up picking carries and mages and go full squishy damage instead of a buffer/CC champ... well then they&#039;re aren&#039;t really playing a supportive role are they? They&#039;re just a second mage, working on cooking up those free kills for their ADCs.\n\nIf the game has any hope of returning to a skill-based state then these things need to change, and the best way to start that is by:\n\n* Hitting the brakes full stop on all Buffs\n\n* Taking a look at the state of the game and who is currently performing better than the rest\n\n* Tweaking them down stat by stat champ by champ and thus steadily opening up the Champion pool so that it can provide better data to improve decision making on champs that consistantly showed signs of struggle\n\n* THEN you can finally begin thinking about _**SMALL INCREASES OR SHIFTS IN STATS.**_","replies":[{"poster":"NoSkillShreking","date":"2018-01-11T20:36:56.194+0000","up_votes":72,"down_votes":11,"body":"Here's hoping we can get this one up to the front too, give those: \"Oh you were mean so your point is mute\" idiots a slap to the face.","replies":[{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2018-01-12T00:51:23.034+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":5,"body":"And why would we consider this post a slap to the face?\n\nThis is a well thought out post, that keeps a level head, and details problems he feels strongly about.

See, Riot used to think exactly like you do now:\n\nhttp://www.nerfnow.com/img/737/1186.png\n\nThis comic is over 5 years old. We're talking S1/S2 league here. Maybe S3? Hard to carbondate such an old comic. Anyways, part of the issue with doing flat nerfs to everything isn't that it fixes the problem. Rather, it just scales the problem back. Let's say you have a messy house and to deal with it you just burn down a room. Sure, you removed some of the mess but your house is still overall messy. You didn't vacuum the room and make a net positive change, you just lowered the overall raw number count. The mess is still a problem.\n\nAs an additional note, you're denying a core philosophy of games: Buffs, overall, feel better to players than nerfs.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsC8io4w1sY\n\nIf Riot went with your suggestion of having (a) patch(s) of nerfs, players wouldn't actually like this sort of thing. Oh, sure, you can argue the boards would be ecstatic that there's a giant nerf to everything that is perceived as OP but the perception would be that this is just a weakening patch. A patch with nothing added or a patch with no merit other than a marker/milestone of S+ being brought down to S while the C tier remains C tier.\n\nHowever, I want to touch on a major point in your argument:\n\n>THEN you can finally begin thinking about SMALL INCREASES OR SHIFTS IN STATS.\n\nThis, to me, is a bigger problem than anything you listed. Part of the problem I see with Riot balance (good or bad) is that it's reliant so heavily on raw numbers and metrics. If a champion gets buff, CD is lowered or mana cost is reduced. If a champ is nerfed, it's raised. DPS numbers go up or down. IMO, this leads to more balance problems down the road. You're completely focusing champion worth on what fat numbers they bring to the table, not the mechanics or the things they do.\n\nThere should be buffs but, instead of raw numerical changes, Riot should look into buffing (and maybe nerfing) things that are strong in a champion's kit but things that don't directly correlate to a raw numerical increase. For example: Brand recently got a buff to his passive that upped the number. This makes him deal more damage but, unless he can damage more, he's not actually better. He just got a bigger number. What if, instead of raising that number, we buffed Brand's passive a different way? For some examples:\n\n* His passive now procs on large/epic monsters (On the PBE now)\n* His radius on his passive is increased.\n* Brand's passive deals the same damage but lasts longer (IE: 2% HP over 5 seconds instead of 4)\n\nNone of these directly buff brand's raw numbers. Instead, they buff his ability to get his passive off and empower one of the unique things about his kit. These are the types of buffs that I feel Riot should look at. That said, I can't blame you for wanting less buffs. The way Riot buffs has probably left a sour taste in your mouth and the notion of buffing might look more like a big ol' number boost than a way to help a champion do their job.","replies":[{"poster":"Zexon9","date":"2018-01-12T13:09:49.024+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yea this would be true if the game was in state of s4 and below (maybe even s5), but the current state of the game is basically, either you oneshot someone or someone oneshots you, and that is not healthy gameplay. \nWhy must every champ now have hp% damage if hes a tank?

IÂ´m not asking to give all adc peashooters but tone down their damage toward tanks so they can live a little longer, especially in case of {{champion:67}}. \nI gave up playing tanks because how ineffective it became tanking them, when I can just pick bruiser and one shot them while still being tanky to tank some damage and get onward with the fight.\n\nAs for one-shoting, come on be real, anything that builds either {{item:3146}} or {{item:3147}} will straight one shot everything but tanks as soon as he gets little lead or that item finished, I play {{champion:58}} one of the worst top laners atm, do you know how much does it take for me to start facerolling anything that doesnÂ´t  have def items? {{item:3071}} and  {{item:3074}}, and thatÂ´s it, exception if \nIÂ´m behind than I need {{item:3053}} and I can do it again.\n\nOnly reason I donÂ´t see everything dead as soon as someone farts in their direction are supports, half of which are by the way getting gutted next patch, and other half will proceed when they see how much they are broken, (Say Hi {{champion:117}} ).\n\nAs for {{champion:122}} IÂ´m probably wrong about him so letÂ´s just end talk about him there.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NyarlathÎ¿tep","date":"2018-01-12T20:17:11.616+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I understand complaining about cho's ulti but darius?

The video phreak made conveniently leaves out all the excess new damage from runes and items, You immediately die or smash them. There is no inbetween.\n\nIm a full tank and I can survive more than 3 seconds in a fight. Even in hots while this is mainly true, there are talents that forcibly make you tanky (Like 75% damage reduction for 4-5 seconds). This game has absolute no tankiness to it. Tanks are just big bodies who have CC and great base damage. They build defense not because it makes them tanky, but because it lets them get off more CC.\n\nYou see where the problem is here?\n\n>They are building defensive stats\n>Not because they are defensive\n>Because it lets them get off more cc and damage than without them\n\nThe dedicated tank role is completely dead.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMÃ¥rvelous","date":"2018-01-12T20:47:57.058+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"This doesn't disprove the point though. All this is telling me is that the nerfs chosen aren't doing their job rather than MORE nerfs being needed. Also, despite saying \"Statistics can prove this\", you didn't link me anything of statistical relevance or not. No OP.gg, no win rates, no game length, nothing. You just tell me \"yeah I don't live longer than three seconds\" and trust me to trust you and that your experience is indicative of the rest of the game.\n\nAnd let's be clear: \n\n>Tanks are just big bodies who have CC and great base damage. They build defense not because it makes them tanky, but because it lets them get off more CC.\n\nThis, since Season 1, has always been the case. Dedicated tanking ala an MMO where you and your side-tank take turns taunting off the boss doesn't exist in a MOBA. Regardless of how you actually feel about the tank role, please do not think this hasn't always been how things are. Let's take Nautilus for example. Nautilus was released in Season 2 as Riot's attempt for you to get all your CC in a single, jungle champion. He controlled fights with rotations of CC and some decent DPS. If anything, the tank role now is more akin to an actual tank in an MMO or what a bruiser should be: You either focus the tank and wittle them down or they chain CC you and lock you down.\n\nTanks have always been measured on CC more than durability. Durability was just their goal so that they had more time to get off CC. That has how it has ALWAYS been, even in MOBAs that aren't league.","replies":[{"poster":"Otter Fire","date":"2018-01-12T21:08:22.040+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never directly thought of tanks that way, building defense to perform more CC casting.
