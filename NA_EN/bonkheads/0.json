So i tried changing SystemMouseSpeed=0 in game.txt file, but everytime i start a new game it goes to SystemMouseSpeed=10 and i cant fix it. And even this, im not sure this is the key to my problem. So if anybody knows something helpful. Please, share with me.

While in a match, League syncs the windows mouse sensitivity settings to match what they are in-game. As far as I know, there is no way to disable this, as it's hard-coded into the game. If you'd like a more streamlined sensitivity, I recommend matching your in-game and windows sensitivity settings so there is little change. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-07-28T08:54:38.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you change something in your config files manually, you must change the same thing in the **PersistedSettings.json** file as well. That file manages your profile on the Riot server so you'll have the same thing wherever you log in.
