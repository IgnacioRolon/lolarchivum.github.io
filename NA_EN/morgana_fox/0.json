So I go to check the e-mail address for that account and what do you know, the last e-mail I got from Riot was over 2 years ago regarding TOS changes. I never got any email about why my account was permanently suspended.\r\n\r\nThis depresses me very much because I know it was not my personality that resulted in this ban  (never had warnings and haven;t played in years) and may have been some random 3rd party program that was on my friends laptop last time I played. I have no idea and I can only guess. I'm going to be in the hospital for a very long time and unable to access a p.c. or anything of the last so today and tomorrow I was going to try and track down any League friends from years ago and play a few last games. I guess I can't..and I don't even know why..","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-29T03:20:38.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like a lot of players have been having issues with the support site over the past couple of days, but it doesn't actually look like this account is suspended for behavior or anything like that.
