HELP!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every Time I am playing a game I don't even know why  but i kept disconnecting like every 5min or so. I tried out every google solution but none of them seem to work. One ex of Dc: I'm playing as Camille and tried walking up to lane and then it said \"ATTEMPTING TO RECONNECT\" and somehow my character end up right next to my opponent and yes you guessed i died. This happened to me several times not just one so I'm here to ask for help if anyone have any solution to this constant disconnection? My teammate even flame me for feeding because of this connection. please help me","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-15T21:22:07.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your connection might be unstable here, and disconnecting entirely from the game server.
