Nah, it&#039;s a team game. But how ONE teammate can ruin it for every one is beyond me. I curse the Koreans or whoever it was that made tank Akali a thing. (When the enemy does it, it&#039;s great, when my team does it though..) Obviously if I was that fed I could have done something to prevent the lost, but when your team huddles together to die I can&#039;t Life Grip them. Anyways rant end--it&#039;s just a rant. Not asking for anything. Just pissed. Pls no one get triggered, if you do, you&#039;re probably a tank Akali mid-main. Season 6 is by far the least efficient out of all the seasons.","replies":[{"poster":"FurretHasAGlock","date":"2016-04-04T19:36:54.395+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They didn't even build it right ;-;","replies":[{"poster":"Leorite","date":"2016-04-04T23:27:35.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL NOPE","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"McKeifus","date":"2016-04-04T19:38:42.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What are you even talking about?
