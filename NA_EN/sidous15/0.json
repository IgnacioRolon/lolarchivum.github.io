I think there is another addition that will not only improve the experience of this game mode, but will allow people to play these games more often. I have long thought that making custom games more customizable would allow players to experiment with the game. One example would be to allow the game creator to decide how much gold players start with so that you could have full build at level one for example. Or to decide how rapidly gold is generated, how fast mana regens, hp regen, minion spawn rate, tower attack rate, etc. Make the game completely customizable so that players can create their own game modes. This would not only allow players to play fun game modes all the time, but then riot could use the weekend rotating game mode to feature player created modes that have become popular.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-04-04T19:35:42.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of the player-created modes rely on everyone agreeing to fairly odd rules that a server could not really enforce, sadly.\n\nSome of the featured game modes have actually been based on custom game types (or custom game glitches, like treeline hexakill).","replies":[]}]}
