The two games I played no one else had this problem and I couldn't find anyone else with this problem. I was playing last night so I don't understand why I would get such bad fps.","replies":[{"poster":"Linkstin","date":"2016-05-05T08:31:03.546+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had this Prob in a Ranked game not to long ago an I have a PC not a Mac so I don't think it's just mac problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AerialRush","date":"2016-05-05T05:41:00.897+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same issue, especially when it goes towards late game I end up having ~10 frames and I usually have 80-100.
