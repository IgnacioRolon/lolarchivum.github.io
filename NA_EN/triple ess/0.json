I went and checked why and who got the chest because the last person I played was on free rotation, however when I clicked the most recently played it said I played Udyr last. As you can see here, https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/321488865439514634/344345069207158794/unknown.png But when I checked my match history, Kayn was my last played as seen here, https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/321488865439514634/344344990073225228/unknown.png I honestly don't know what's happening and already changed my password to my account.
