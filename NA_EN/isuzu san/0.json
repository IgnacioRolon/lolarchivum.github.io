There is a \"Camille Launch Day\" stream announcement somewhere around here. Looks like the day to shoot for with Camille is 12/12. Sucks a bit that they're only going to get her in a day before following patch.\n\nBut the fine print just says \"patch 6.24\" so they are still technically meeting the goal.
