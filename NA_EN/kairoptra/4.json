Perhaps he is simply one among the ancient race and not necessarily the procreator, but the only one who has not embraced the power of true ice. Perhaps they were empowered by true ice to begin with and he simply broke away because he didn&#039;t like what he was seeing. Perhaps he gained some power taboo to them and was exiled. Perhaps he was simply so powerful that he was the only one left after their eradication. Perhaps he was their ruler, bestowed with some great force of nature. Perhaps he was their &quot;Chosen One&quot;, and his powers are a some sort of sign. Perhaps the progenitor of the Watchers&#039; race is his evil twin brother. Perhaps he thirsted for power, sought knowledge, or was simply eccentric and through any of those means stumbled upon his powers.\r\n\r\nThere are countless possibilities, so let&#039;s see what you guys can come up with!
