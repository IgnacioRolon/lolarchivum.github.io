But if you want something with a bit more emotional investment and some character nuance, then both Warmother and Lux have been far more engaging. Even \"From the Ashes\" and \"At the Edge of the World\" still haunt me.\n\nBut it's cool that we finally got an official account of Rengar &amp; Kha'zix first conflict. Hopefully though, now that it's been done the writers can do more with either of them than just rinse and repeat fights.","replies":[{"poster":"IlyaK1986","date":"2019-08-30T17:47:55.701+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well, okay, that's not a fair fight. Warmother was absolutely amazing. Lux, though...good lord, I hope we never go back to Demacia again. It feels like that entire region is the most plain-vanilla wannabe-goody-two-shoes place around, except OOPS! Massive prejudice against the magic that...everyone else uses.\n\nEdge of the World was...interesting. And the ending was just kind of funny. \n\n\"This will not be the end of Ysard Tomiri!\"\n\nNarrator: it was the end of Ysard Tomiri.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2019-08-30T02:32:03.195+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Glad you enjoyed!

We missed out on more PROJECT lore, and in general, the lore seems to have really slowed to a trickle, even though it feels like there are certainly a bunch of stories to tell in any direction you choose (hilarious? Jinx/Ziggs/Heimer shenanigans in Piltover, more Vi+Cait buddy cop stuff. Right in the feels? Just about anyone in Ionia. Pure, unbridled badass? Ashe vs. Sejuani. Adventure and awesomeness? Can we get immortal journey lore?), but instead, we get so very little.

But I did like how Rengar describes Kha as something otherworldy and wrong (especially the part where he says even the air refuses to touch it :D). It's not badly written, it's just that this kind of story isn't the kind of story I appreciate, I'm more for characters and internal struggles :)\n\nDo you usually read league's lore or did you just happen to read only this story? If so, if you explain what you liked, we could suggest other stories on universe that you could enjoy :)\n\n\n\"Silence for the damned\" and \"The eye in the abyss\" are two of my favourite stories out there :)","replies":[{"poster":"IlyaK1986","date":"2019-08-30T17:46:05.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, yeah, Freljord is generally a region of badass, since that's the necessary prerequisite to survive there.\n\nSo, consequently, Freljord lore is going to be badass.
