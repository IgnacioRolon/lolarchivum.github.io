You level up, open a chest, and get an Ashe shard to disenchant for what... 90? You'd have to grind endlessly for more and more shards and pray you get lucky to get a 6300 one to disenchant into... 1.3k. Then either the stars align and you get the shard you want, and you get it at roughly 50% off, or you painstakingly grind even more to get the full amount of BE.\n\nHonestly, the old system was much easier once you had the basic runes out of the way.","replies":[{"poster":"Helmight","date":"2017-11-07T18:03:24.343+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently, I don't believe you actually need the full price of a champion in order to enchant the shard. Pretty sure turning a champion shard into a champion permanent is only a couple hundred BE, as opposed to saving up thousands of IP. The new system obviously has reduced how much BE you get from disenchanting stuff, but I don't think that the value of shards have changed. \n\nSo if you're looking to just build out your available champion pool, the new system is roughly the same. However, you ARE correct in that it's significantly harder to get a specific champion you want, especially if they're newer. \n\n~~The pessimistic part of me says that Riot specifically engineered it this way to get players to buy more champions with RP, given that rune sales are going away, but that's just a tinfoil hat theory.~~","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RainbowIcee","date":"2017-11-07T16:07:09.655+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":5,"body":"Am i the only one that feels like tomorrow is just another day and regardless of the new system is going to feel like same ol same ol ? What changes a strategy game to me imo is when there's freedom to do things, this new system isn't exactly adding more freedom to the game it's more like forcing specific roles to champs and strategy so tomorrow league will still be the same game were the tower is butter, herald will take w/e tower it slams into first, and we will all run around playing the same way we do today and have since the last actual major changes to the game that were herald/dragons/baron/towers/jg. So to me... imo, tomorrow is still season 7 until they change how we win, or interact with the game not just different numbers on the same way we do damage. But again, just my own opinion. I don't fear, I just wait. When will the game have mechanics for immobile champs to catch up to the mobility creep like breaking some map terrain to run up to the {{champion:64}} ? when will an effective split pusher be a considered strategy or threat? when will a strategic defense lead to an actual counter attack rather than \"just wait till they throw \".
