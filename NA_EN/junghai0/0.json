I popped ult, rushed in, did a bunch of damage, and the enemy started retreating. So we started chased, and then I realized. My ult was back up. So I popped it, and caught a few guys. They died, and now it was just the stragglers left. I then realized my ult was back up. Seriously.\r\n\r\n40 second CD max rank on ult, and it gives 30% CDR, and everytime I go Super Saiyan It gets reduced by the CD of Q everytime I cast a spell, which about 2.5 seconds at that point. \r\n\r\n40 seconds with 30% CDR is about 28 seconds. If I pop Arcane mastery once, I can get off about 4 spells, meaning it shaves off about ten seconds, reducing the cooldown to 18 seconds. It goes on cooldown the moment you cast it and lasts 6 seconds, meaning the real CD is about 12 seconds. 12 seconds, even without a full 40% CDR.","replies":[{"poster":"ArcticWolf24","date":"2015-06-10T22:08:33.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"check surrender at 20 they have a few changes on Ryze in the pbe","replies":[{"poster":"JungHai0","date":"2015-06-10T23:07:23.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I saw them.

Your Q can be easily dodged, you can't farm with abilities or you go oom (aka dead meat). He has mana problems untill lategame, when you  stop being oom after \"going off\". You are also not tanky like you used to.\nPerma root is broken, but remove this and this guy is still crap compared to the other machine gun mages (Kata - manaless; Cass - kills you with 3 E)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ulquiorra995","date":"2015-06-11T09:35:45.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the bigger problem might be that you die with nothing you can do about it the moment you find yourself within his W range if he goes into passive.
