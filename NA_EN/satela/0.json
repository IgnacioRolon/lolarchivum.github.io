It hasn't ever done this before. it happens every single league game. I can half of the time wait for my computer to restart and get back into the game, but lost about 5 minutes of xp and minions. Because of this I have got 20 min wait time 3 times. I took in my computer to Best Buy to see what was wrong and I just got it back. I start a game, have to wait the 20 minutes, then when I finally accept a match, the client glitches, and makes me wait another 20 minutes. After that 20 minutes of wait time, I join a game, choose my champion, then the client glitches and sends me back to the lobby, and updates. Now it will take me a whole hour to get into a game, and only count as one time waited. The update has taken 20 minutes as well. I started finding a match at 7:20 and now its 8:40 and it isn't even done updating and I still have to wait another 20 minutes. I am honor level 5, and none of those games I was feeding. Most of the games I was doing decent, for example the last one I was 8/0 wu jg, but my computer crashed and I couldn't get back in time. I think the punishments should be not so harsh, as all they do is make me wait 20 minutes to play a game. You should punish the people that are inting and feeding, not the people that have hardware issues.

Is there an error, or a bugsplat?  I want to help you out here, but I don't recommend queueing up for anymore games until this is resolved.  The [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) treats everyone the same, and even though you aren't meaning to leave it's causing others a bad experience.
