It Gave me leaver buster for 20 mins because of this bug. I think riot should make leaver buster able to identify when a bug is happening or if its a connection problem so innocent people don't get punished","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-03T20:31:24.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Hyperion3182* touched on some great points here. You can never get a 20min LPQ for a single instance of disconnecting from champ select, and it indeed does take a trend of disconnections before you see a penalty. \n\nIt sounds like what happened was less of a bug and more of a disconnection from the champ select servers. Most of the time, this is caused by an unstable connection to the server and can be exacerbated by network settings that cause a poor connection to occur. I strongly recommend checking out our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a first step in resolving this.\n\nLet me know if this issue persists through those changes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hyperion3182","date":"2016-10-03T13:48:43.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1/ 20 minutes mean you left/AFK multiple games. It takes a history of bad connection/AFKing/quitting on purpose to reach 20 minutes queue.\n2/ It's impossible to make the distinction. Classic example: you ragequit by simply unplugging your router. There is no system that can guess it was your sneaky action and not a simple  electricity outage.\n3/ LeaverBuster is automated hence perfectly fair amongst every player in the World.","replies":[]}]}
