Every time I try to get into game, the loading screen freezes before the champion portraits show up. Tried doing custom with friend to see if game would continue to load regardless, but it stopped loading. Ended up tabbing out and reopening, and it finally loaded but I got a black screen. Continued to see a black screen until, strangely, I was screen sharing on Skype. Game runs in windowed mode, but windowed mode messes with my camera movements. Wondering if there was any way to fix this or just hope that the next patch will address this ;P","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-21T18:10:43.115+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Windows 10 anniversary update made some rather large changes to the Xbox game bar and enabled the game DVR feature by default. Since this issue has been causing certain issues in League around low FPS and game crashes, I recommend temporarily disabling DVR entirely to see if it resolves your issue.
