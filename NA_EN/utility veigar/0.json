With each turret removed the item devalues, so it goes backwards in efficiency. Which half links into another problem: By the time it's bought turrets are mostly gone. The way to 'solve' this is to incentivise Ohmwrecker as an early item. That, however, brings much worse gameplay and many more problems than the one it intends to solve. i.e., the tradeoff is not a good one. \n\nIf Ohmwrecker is a good early buy, it fast becomes a mandatory buy and overshadows other itemisation. \nIt encourages increased snowballing (which could enter the vicious cycle of buff towers => increased dependence on Ohmwrecker). \nIt makes towers less safe and reduces the tension of sieges. \nIt reduces the efficacy of other team comps. E.g., Split pushers rely on the safety of the team under turret to enable them to be absent. \n\nIn short it's basically impossible to make Ohm a good buy without making it bat shit OP and having a detrimental effect on the game.
