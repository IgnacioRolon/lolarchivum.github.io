New players wont have access to all summoner spells and masteries**\r\nThis is like people trying football for the first time but since they are new, they are not allowed to have a keeper and they have to wear flip flops, while their experienced opponents fucking demolish their team. But hey, at least you can ghost and heal to safety.  \r\n\r\n**2. New players have to be level 10 to use the practice tool**\r\nCause God forbit them getting better at the game before entering competitive gameplay\r\n\r\n**3. Players that aren't new but creates a new account can click a field stating that they are experienced players**\r\nThat does not keep Riot from forcing you to play vs bots for 5 hours - not learning anything a damn thing. \r\n\r\nI hope you will look into this someday cause this might be why your dropout rate has increased significantly for that past 8 months. \r\n\r\nOk, bye","replies":[{"poster":"BringYourBest","date":"2018-06-07T11:57:36.074+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":3,"body":"Please you think Riot will ever get off their lazy asses and do something legit for new players.\n\n{{champion:22}} {{item:3075}} need I remind you this still exists as the basic tutorial ?","replies":[{"poster":"ZackTheWaffleMan","date":"2018-06-07T15:33:54.825+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"They're working on it, apparently.","replies":[{"poster":"BringYourBest","date":"2018-06-07T17:04:52.088+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"_Soon~_","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Budget Yami","date":"2018-06-08T00:41:08.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe they should put GAREN as the main person for the tutorial?\nYeah the Tutorial needs to be updated...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Budget Yami","date":"2018-06-08T00:38:57.172+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"For a beginner this isn't really a problem.\nWhen I started LoL (about 9 months ago) I did not realize there were runes or even other spells to use, I had no idea what was going on until I got to level 20 or so and started to understand the game better.\n\nFor a SMURF this is a problem (or solution?).\nI like this system because it discourages Smurfs to continue on there account because of how frustrating the experience can be without spells or runes ESPECIALLY against other smurfs how are level 10 and above. I know this does not stop smurfs from being created (I am guilty of one myself because of I got banned, I haven't used it since)  but It should help the new players from not being crushed all the time and can reduce the amount of SMURFS allowing more fresh players to join the wonderful community!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"dboy225","date":"2018-06-08T08:58:46.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"wonderful? lmao. far from wonderful, but amusing and entertaining nonetheless","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vhan8765","date":"2018-06-07T14:42:02.720+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best part of the new player experience definitely has to be with the new rune system; you unlock the ability to make your whole 2 rune pages at level 11 but can only change your keystone rune.

The limits imposed on summoner spells and masteries are completely arbitrary, and serve only to force newer players into weaker builds so that they get bodied even harder at the start. Worse still, it often teaches the wrong things to players, as it pushes them to play in a manner that is completely different from the way League actually gets played. This itself is compounded by the bot games players are pushed into, because bots don't jungle. It may not be quite as bad as Thornmail on Ashe, but it's the same kind of terrible tutorial design that forces even _more_ of a learning barrier onto new players, because they have to unlearn a ton of bad habits in addition to re-learning the whole game in order to play properly. Moreover, the restrictions themselves feel terrible, so the system altogether feels like it's more likely to push players _away_ from League, instead of facilitating onboarding. I'm looking forward to the revamped new player experience Riot is proposing, but if it's going to continue imposing arbitrary restrictions upon newer players, it's going to fall flat on its face.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jimmyjames109","date":"2018-06-08T04:58:24.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This and players making new accounts and being assholes.
