I would imagine that it should already be hard enough to get stuff transferred between accounts, and even harder if it's beteen regions, because of the different prices, but I figured I would give it a shot anyways. I'll await an answer and thanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"kattzkitti","date":"2017-10-23T05:58:22.141+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Their policy is a firmly planted \"no\" to all the above, unless they've changed it in the last year or so (unlikely for this kind of thing). There's just so many incredibly easy ways this kind of service could go horribly wrong, both for Riot and the players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-23T20:31:35.652+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Transferring content between accounts has historically been a pretty firm \"no\" like KattzKitti said.

That being said it was worth a shot. Anyways, thanks for the answer.","replies":[]}]}]}
