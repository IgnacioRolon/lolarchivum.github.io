There are two ways you can fix the problem: **1) Un-pin League of Legends from your task bar. Then, use the patcher's \"Repair\" tool (click the question mark in the upper right-hand corner).** 2)** Re-install League of Legends** We're currently working on a fix to address the issue and will release it as soon as possible!","replies":[{"poster":"K端rama","date":"2016-07-27T16:37:40.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on where they're experiencing the bug splat.
