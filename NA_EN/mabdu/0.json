What is the point of having scaling runes like Dark Harvest? It&#039;s nearly impossible to hit 150 stacks in 15min, so it&#039;s like I have to pick an early game rune or lose. Also, do you want every jungler to pick sorcery as their primary or secondary rune page? Cant diversify? 80% of junglers i play against go celerity/waterwalking for this silly scuttle fight that I can&#039;t try other runes.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-06-19T23:40:18.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good ideas meant for a different meta.\n\nDark Harvest is also busted in ARAM and keeps getting nerfed there.","replies":[]}]}
