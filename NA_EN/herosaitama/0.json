If the name exceeds 16 letters or has inappropriate wording then you would run into trouble.  If you're still having an issue, hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so we can see why there's a snag in the way.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HeroSaitama","date":"2017-10-14T00:09:47.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Porocles,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=qEpppgwm,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-10-13T23:33:42.708+0000)\n>\n> Hey, it may take a moment for your account to sync.
