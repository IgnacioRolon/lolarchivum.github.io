I suspect it's happening again since the symptoms on my side were identical today. My ping usually stays at a solid 62ms but today it was shooting up randomly sometimes as high as 2300ms+.  Please investigate this issue quickly as it makes League unplayable for me and many others.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-05T23:16:38.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I checked our records and don't see any server-related incidents from recent. Give your modem/router a quick power cycle (unplug for 60 seconds) and see if the issue continues to pop up for you.\n\nPlease let me know if your issues persist!","replies":[]}]}
