Do me a favor and update your DNS settings to 8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4 really quickly and test it in a custom game. \n\nIf that doesn't seem to help at first, run a traceroute for me so I can get a clear picture of how your connection looks to see what might be happening. You can use [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) to run a trace to 104.160.131.1 and post the results here so I can see. Make sure you let that trace run for at least 5-10 min to get some good data.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Charming","date":"2018-01-30T23:10:14.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah last couple of days my ping went up by 20ish.

Every since the new Patch (8.2) my ping won't stay down. I truly believe this has something to do with Riot and the new update so hopefully they can fix this soon.","replies":[]}]}
