I received an email saying that I am MMR boosting and I get a 2 week suspension. No one but me has played on this account. And I have been playing solo queue games every single day for the last 2 weeks. No one but me plays on this account. I am extremely upset and disappointed in riot. In no way or form have I elo boosted or mmr boosted. I've risen to Gold 1 and then got demoted and then had a short win streak. IN ANY CASE IM THE ONLY ONE PLAYING. I really don't understand. I've spent so much money on this game and I'm going to give up on this game and this company.\r\n\r\nign: KR Dopa\r\nuser: deoxidize27","replies":[{"poster":"Keyru","date":"2015-08-01T00:51:21.701+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey everyone,\n\nThe emails are not false and suspensions will follow. If you feel that this is an incorrect suspension, feel free to create a ticket to support and we can work with you there.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\n@KR Dopa\n\nI decided to look into your account and double check this case. While you are correct that YOU never engaged in boosting, the account did. This account was a botted account, that got boosted and placed into Gold, which was then purchased by you. Due to this breach, I have went forward with permanently suspending  your account.","replies":[{"poster":"HyperLynx","date":"2015-11-21T06:44:32.440+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could you kindly look into my account?

It is true that I played these ranked games on my father`s computer because is better have better ping better hardware everything and I had IP adress that is different then it is when I play normal games with my friends. I GOT BANNED CAUSE I PLAYED PLACEMENT MATCHES ON DIFFERENT COMPUTER. Riot if this is your way off banning boosters Im really sorry for your players base. I was writting to support and got some **** answer. Im planning to stop playing LoL and I am willing to give my 2 diamonds account to Bronze 5 players so they could destroy life of other Diamond players because of your ignorance...

I mean I get that the IP's were different which could look strange, but I can confirm every login on my account ever made (I make logs of it, cause I also record my stats) yet I still received a 2 week ban.

I had to go to the support page to apply for a ticket, and they told me its MMR boosting...\nBut the problem is I didnt even play Ranked games lately.. I was playing bots as my internet wasnt really good, so i didnt want to play 5v5 or ranked in case I get reported and banned... From what I recall, the ranked games I played was in the summer. aand i only remember the rounds with syndra where i had a winning streak, and got myself back to gold. and thats where i stopped playing. and went back to play with my friends(we use to play every weekend). in between the games I even talked to my friends and told them that I was going back to gold so I wont be playing with them.... I've played this game for a very long time and haven't played much ranked games. was at silver for a long time because I didnt really see the reason to go up the ladder, until my friends told me that there was price for gold division, so i went up... Is it possible that this is the reason? I dont play ranked before and lose many times when i do but suddenly I went up to gold(last season), and got to silver in placement, then went back to gold(this season, around in the summer).","replies":[]},{"poster":"PEACEMlNUSONE","date":"2015-09-30T19:23:19.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello riot, i have the same issue.

You'll need to [submit a ticket to Riot Games Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) regarding your issue. A few tips as you submit your request: \n\n1. Be sure to submit as much information in your initial ticket as possible. For obvious reasons, each Rioter request for more information will delay the resolution of the issue. \n2. Create an account on the Riot Games Support website. It'll save you a lot of time in the future and keep your requests organized and easier to find/access. \n3. Be respectful and polite in your correspondences with Riot Support. \n\nBest of luck!","replies":[]}]}
