Where you test things to see how they fit and how they will work out? If I&#039;m wrong please let me know. Azir hasn&#039;t been touched since the little love tap you guys gave him, with the 2 seconds off on his W. I haven&#039;t seen any form of testing on the platform you supposedlyâ€‹ test things on.\r\nI completely understand that Azir is very hard to balance between OP and useless, but I wouldn&#039;t even be writing this if I saw some form of effort on the PBE. All I&#039;ve seen for the past two years is new skins for everyone&#039;s favorite champ (Yas, Riven, Lee) the meta champs that are in every game. Me obviously being an Azir main, is stuck. I see such an amazing champion with such great potential. But no one is even looking in his direction. People would rather leave him in the forgotten pile while they make the 14th Lee-Sin skin.\r\nSorry for the rant, I&#039;d just like to play one game as my favorite champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-06-09T03:58:32.993+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"We put stuff on PBE once it's pretty close to release, with the occasional exception. For a lot of things PBE doesn't give very good feedback, given how most people aren't playing to win, it's harder to get good matchmaking, leaving is rife etc. PBE can give good feel feedback sometimes, and catches a number of bugs, it's usually very poor for highly experimental concept testing though, to the extent that putting something like Azir update experimentation there now is more of a hindrance than a help. We are testing some Azir stuff at present, starting with trying a reduced spell range version of his existing kit to see what we can learn from that. Can't offer anything further on timeline at present, do expect it'll be a while.\n\nRelated note, in terms of total designer time I'm confident Azir's in the top 10 of champs for time received for the period since his release. We've done a lot of looking in his direction, in part because we agree his concept as returning Shuriman emperor is a really cool one.","replies":[{"poster":"Winterkill","date":"2017-06-13T22:16:48.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7PyypK2Z,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-06-09T03:58:32.993+0000)\n>\n> We put stuff on PBE once it&#x27;s pretty close to release, with the occasional exception.

I dont think there was ever an official reason as to why it was removed. It sorta just dissipated and never came back. It would be nice to have some closure on exactly what went on and why it got canned ....","replies":[{"poster":"pretty hurts","date":"2017-06-09T15:10:44.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was removed cause it made Riven simply saying broken.","replies":[{"poster":"La Bello","date":"2017-06-09T23:43:31.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"that was a numbers problem not a design problem.\n\nby design it made total sense.
