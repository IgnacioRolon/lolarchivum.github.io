You make it sound like I should never honor my premades. I queue with 1-2 other people 100% of the time, usually the same individuals. \r\nDoes honor from a premade degrade over time if it's been too many times in a certain period? Or is it always at a lower value just because it's premade?\r\n\r\nI don't want to basically have a zero or negative impact on my friends' (and mine since honoring raises your own) honor if I end up honoring them frequently.\r\n\r\nBeing scared of this system and throwing honor to randoms at times they may not deserve it doesn't seem like a good solution, but that's what I'm going to be doing.","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2019-06-14T15:43:15.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is dead may never die...is something no one ever said about old threads.
