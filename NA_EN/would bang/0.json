On the client, I got the message that my account has been logged in to on another computer. This happened twice and I decided to change my password. However I cant since the original Email account has been comprimised and I dont have access to it. On the boards I made a support ticket requesting for it to be changed to another email account . Blitzcrank Bot ( God Bless his Soul) told me to log out and change it to a account recovery ticket. I did that, and I could not find it, because by mistake I put the original email as the one that I cant access anymore\n.  Then I could not log into my account on the boards/support/etc. I since made another support ticket (sorry) but with the correct email. However when I click on the link sent to me on my email It says that it dosent exist. \n\nSupport Ticket I sent:http://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/25408991\n\n\npls help me\nEDIT: It says REDACTED please help me im scared.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-04T23:11:28.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry, we can help!  Filling out an [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) is great, because it will go directly to our account recovery team to help with regaining access.  You will have to create a new one though, because the email would be sent to that address which you don't have access to.  \n\nSince you don't have to login to use the form, it's important to do another with an email you do have access to.\n\nI hope that helps clear things up, and we'll reply back to your new ticket as soon as we can!","replies":[{"poster":"would bang","date":"2017-02-05T14:25:14.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ticket came up as REDACTED.
