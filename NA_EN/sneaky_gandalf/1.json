Where the rioter sent through one of the glitches that he had obviously seen. I finished the other missions but I have got no response, and for that reason all my work to get a project skin for free is ruined. If I could please get a project skin token for compensation or something like that would be awesome. Or just any compensation at all would be amazing but, if you do nothing I guess that is fine.
