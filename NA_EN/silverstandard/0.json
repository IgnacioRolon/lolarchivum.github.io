Players can be bombarded with skill shots and work on their dodging. You can make it so there's an option for dodging while farming/fighting or just out of combat. You could also practice hitting skill shots on moving targets rather than immobile scarecrows that don't fight back.\r\n\r\nThere are too many players who are just crap at this (myself included) and that need to work on it to make games more challenging and fun.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Cocho","date":"2017-05-29T01:36:48.546+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be a funny minigame. If you're put in an arena with 1 enemy, or more. Then there are just a bunch of skillshots that come from the sides and things in the arena.

I am a Blitzcrank magnet for whatever reason when I'm playing an ADC, but I can simply side step them when I'm the support.
