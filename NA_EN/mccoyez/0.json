Since being placed in B5, I&#039;ve moved to B4, but now the league point (lp for the rest of the thread) generator is glitched, making statistically impossible to advance. The average has been +13.5lp/win, -24lp/loss. Those numbers make it easy to figure out, you need to win 2/3 games to gain 3lp, or simply it&#039;s 1lp/game with a 67% win rate.\r\n\r\nBut that&#039;s down from B5, where the average was around +/-20lp, almost 200% down. So I went in and added up all the games from all the people in my last game which took me from a 78% win rate and 50lp, to a 70% win rate and 27lp. The team average win rates, excluding myself were 41% vs 44%. So since you can&#039;t fall out of ranked play, with the lp ratio at an almost 200% loss penalty, there is no real number you can plug into the equation 1/5(x)+41=67 where x exists between 0-100 (you can&#039;t have a win rate over 100%)\r\n\r\nI know the priority is the lcs and revenue, but either the generator for the lp is broken, or it&#039;s statistically impossible to advance when 90% of the players in the game only win an average of 42% of their games, and you need a minimum of 67% to move up 1lp per game (which would mean you need to win around 517 games to advance to silver) I know after the point where people with lower win rates are demoted and no longer in your que, this might work. The player with the 27% win rate won&#039;t be in your gold 3 que night after night after night, but when you&#039;re in que with bronze 5 players and need the 67% win rates, it&#039;s either impossible (mathmatically, I know it&#039;s possible to hard carry yourself) or my math is just wrong.\r\n\r\nIt gets even more lopsided when you start winning, I could be wrong again, but it seems like (hypothetical numbers) at 0lp, you get a standard team, but if you win 3 games in a row, you get a +7rating of some sort, which then pairs you with a -3,-2,-1,0 rated player, to balance the game. The example when I had the 78% win rate, which would be the high, they had a 54% win rate, their high, then everyone else was 44%, except one guy on my team that was 27%. Again, this would work in elos where you can fall out of the division and balance the games, in my game, where the 27%win rate was the adc, who averaged 3.7/9.4/6.5 or say, 1 kill per 2 deaths, during a game, just to be even, the other 3 spots (excluding the support) need to average 3 kills per 2 deaths for us to be roughly even. But if you assume 3/4 of your team is capable of playing with a 3/2 kill/death ratio, it&#039;s unlikely they would have 44% win rates. \r\n\r\nAnyways, this is long enough, but if someone better at statistical analysis sees just a simple thing I&#039;m missing, (I have also found around 70-80% of games are trolled, so if you factor in a 50% chance that your game will be 4v5 (-20% effective gold, and the burst of 20% of your team) or 5v5 with a feeder (-20% gold, -20% damage, then add in the transfer of kill gold and assists for 15-20kills) I just don&#039;t see a mathmatically valid equation for advancement.","replies":[]}
