This is because at 33% your patcher begins to connect to the patching service and downloading the new patch files, previous to that it's only scanning current files and figuring out where the new files will go. I definitely recommend working through all the steps in our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure everything is squared away there. \n\nLet me know if you still have issues after completing those steps.","replies":[]}]}
