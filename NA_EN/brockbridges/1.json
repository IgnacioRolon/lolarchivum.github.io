Most of the scaling runes match the flats by level 6ish. If you're using a champ with a good early game or a good enough one to get you through to level 6 or possibly you suck until level 6 anyways (Akali), you won't mind getting scaling because you'll either be crap regardless of runes or you'll be able to sustain until 6 and then womp all over your enemies after 6. AD champs and junglers are the only ones who usually prefer flats over scalings because if you're playing Riven and you get scaling, you're not going to snowball instantly and might have issues. Junglers have the same issue where their jungle is just too tough without scalings (With exceptions like WW, Fiddle, and Aatrox).\n\nI'm talking about scaling AD and AP at least. Scaling MR glyphs are OP as hell unless you're against, like, a LeBlanc where you need 50 MR at level 3 or else you're being 100-0'd.\n\nI've never used scaling armor, but I'd guess if you scale OFF of armor like Rammus, Malphite, and Taric, scaling armor runes could work if you don't feel like you need to fear the enemy too much early on... which as those three you don't have much to fear in the jungle, top, or even as a support.","replies":[{"poster":"Silverthane","date":"2015-11-20T09:52:32.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"actually i remember doing the math but i might have to in order to confirm this but last time i did it it matched regular runes at around level 9.

Primary runes draw even at 6.\n\nIf you want a mixed page it is generally advisable to get flat Quints and flat secondary runes, while getting scaling primary runes.\n\nFor example my full defense page. has flat armor red, scaling health yellow, scaling MR blue, and flat MR Quints.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-11-20T10:14:21.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's about level 6ish. The scalings give 3 times the bonus. Liiiike AP Glyphs. Each gives .17 per level where-as flats give 1.19 (Divide 1.19 by .17 and you get 7). At level 7, you'll match it completely. So while I say 6, 7 is when you actually average out, but it still applies for champs who have to wait until 6 for a powerspike or champs who simply have poor as heck early games and runes won't help (AKA Kog, Vayne, Akali, etc., though for the first two there you might want AS rather than any scaling stats.) benefit most from scaling since... well... They're going to do poorly regardless and you may as well make their mid to late better if nothing is going to help their poor early (or impossible to help in champs like Akali who literally can't do ANYTHING pre-ult except for piss off Yasuo's, but you can do that regardless of runes and masteries as Akali. Lulz.).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Milodic Mellodi","date":"2015-11-20T09:28:58.210+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Champions that don't necessarily care about certain Rune buffs EG, but appreciate the extra for LG, definitely appreciate Scaling. For example, Champs that rely a certain amount on their abilities and cooldowns for LG ({{champion:13}}, {{champion:25}}, {{champion:18}}, etc.) appreciate having Scaling CDR Glyphs. Those champs that don't care altogether about their EG damage output, but want their presence to be known LG (supports like {{champion:99}}, {{champion:16}}, {{champion:37}}, and perhaps {{champion:17}} because...Teemo...) appreciate having Scaling offensive Runes (having Scaling Ability Power makes for a better Qs and Es on Soraka compared to Flat Runes). For defensive Runes, having Scaling always trumps Flat unless you're that insecure about your opponent's damage output.\nIt really depends on what you want/need for your champs. If you need the buffs for a better EG, go with Flat Runes; if you're relying more on LG buffs, you should go with Scaling. Remember that the crossover between Scaling and Flat is anywhere between Level 5-12 (depending on the Rune), so place them according to how you want to play your champs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SKOBODO","date":"2015-11-20T13:50:05.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On ARAM and Dominion?
