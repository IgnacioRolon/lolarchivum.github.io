Today, or just now, and not whinein&#039; or nothin, but appearently some person was all kinds of unhappy and wanted to &quot;report me cause I didn&#039;t know how to play the game&quot;.... in intro. Soooo, the person was like, level 20 somethin and  im like 7,and im all, why is he all kinds of upset?\n Im not worried or nothin&#039; i think it&#039;s kinda all kinds of silly. \nBut, what do you all think, is that ridiculous or is it my fault for bein&#039; new??","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2016-11-29T01:09:19.950+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, it's ridiculous silliness.\nReports like that hold about as much weight as an anchor made of featherdusters.\n\nIf/when you meet someone like that you're better off muting them, 'cause they'll try their very best to ruin your mood.  If you hold tab in-game and click that little speaker beside their champ their chat will disappear.  Some people just like livin' while sitting on cacti.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lil Miss Schitzy","date":"2016-11-30T21:01:31.890+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone whos replied, I love you","replies":[{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2016-12-01T15:53:58.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you :) I'm happy to reply and talk with new players, and I'm happy that you've added me.

The behavior you received from that person is just a start. I do not want to scare you or anything but every other game you might have someone who thinks he is a god at this game and everyone else is a noob. In that case you should do one or both of these things.\n1) Just smile at their silliness and move on, let them rabble.\n2) Mute them. It is the single best facility this game has. U can type /mute (player name) to mute them. It will be as if they do not exist in chat.\nLater on in the game when you are playing ranked, people like these will come in bulk, a part of learning league is to learn how to handle them as well. Stay positive at all times\nHope it helped. Good luck on the rift.","replies":[]}]}
