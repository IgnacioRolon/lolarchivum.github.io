There have been MANY platinum players who trash talk other people for not being as good but they are either smurfing or have low enough mmr to be in a silver game. My question is.. Why? Diamond players are mostly nice in my experience and gold players are the nicest people ive met so why are platinum players so annoying and have such big egos ? Someone please explainnn","replies":[{"poster":"Nevurwin","date":"2018-04-25T17:22:30.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive been in plat since season 3 and yea, its pretty toxic. I see Plat as a stepping stone ( Similar to Silver ) Its the rank that separates the good from the great, and a lot of mixing of players in between. You get a lot of player frustration in this tier because every match feels like its heavily one sided, this is the tier where players hard tilt, ive seen friends go from plat 2 to plat 4 in a day and vice versa. Me on the other hand, i just stay plat 5 cause i am old and washed up now :'(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bright Claws","date":"2018-04-25T04:01:33.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Diamonds are even worse ime.

He likes to trash talk a bit and poke fun but nothing much after that and thats to his friends. He is pretty quiet in game though and doesnt chat much with others unless its the beginning of the game and is trying to make a joke.","replies":[{"poster":"Favorite Blade","date":"2018-04-24T23:27:17.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"props to your friend, wish more ppl were nice tbh","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-04-24T23:04:47.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plat players live in perpetual fear of ranked decay.","replies":[]}]}
