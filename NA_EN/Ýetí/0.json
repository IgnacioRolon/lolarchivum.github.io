Either just before entering the loading screen or just after entering the loading screen, the game crashes with a bug splat error. Upon trying to reconnect it crashes again. After logging out and logging back in the message \"Data corruption detected.... we will repair the installation now\"\r\n\r\nAfter it finishes the repair I am able to rejoin the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-18T04:52:31.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you running the Alpha client when this happens?","replies":[]}]}
