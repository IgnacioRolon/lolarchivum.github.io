I was fine up until Kled came out and have run the client repair tool since then, but I have ended up with at least 4 bug splats and a client recognized crash since then, and it's really starting to effect my games when I can't get into them because of your client. It's also the second day in a row where i got kicked out of a match for prolonged inactivity when I couldn't get into in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-15T17:38:14.751+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bugsplats are generally the result of problematic drivers or hardware issues. If you haven't already, I strongly recommend trying the steps in our [Bugsplat & Crashing guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes), as there are fairly simple and common solutions there. Be sure to test any changes in a custom match to prevent future Leaverbuster penalties. \n\nLet me know if you continue to have issues after taking those steps.","replies":[{"poster":"exiled trickster","date":"2016-08-17T03:25:59.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I reinstalled the game yesterday and out of the 6 games I've played. I've crashed in 3 of them. My 2 games in ARAM and my 1 in customs went just fine, but when I tried to do normals on Twisted Treeline once and Summoner's Rift twice I still crashed. I'm not playing at settings any different than what they've been at the whole time I've had the game which is already on low or minimum to start with. I defragmented, ran malware and virus scans and done just about everything I can that should've solved problems, but they still continue and it's seriously cutting into me even getting the chance to enjoy the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-21T15:51:13.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since that guide was not able to resolve this issue for you, I strongly recommend reaching out to our tech team by submitting a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
