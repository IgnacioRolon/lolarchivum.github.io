Didn't work. if I reply again, am I going to be told to remove another program or something else?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SargeP","date":"2015-07-07T23:23:39.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Digital Ram,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=Ar8pLe4x,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-26T20:05:21.890+0000)\n>\n> Hey Easybake!\n> \n> This is usually an issue with Graphics drivers crashing while in game.

Plus This problem Only happens when I am Running Curse while playing the game when Curse is not running he Game does not crash at all. AMD has not released a update for there drivers that where not Beta since December witch is really annoying. This Has nearly cost me my Promotion in ranked.{{champion:62}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dr Cat","date":"2015-01-26T23:17:11.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like he/she has the default windows drivers installed for their graphics card, which many graphics cards cannot use with League.
