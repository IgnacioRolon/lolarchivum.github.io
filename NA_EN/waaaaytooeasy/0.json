The problem is that the patcher is stuck at calculating differences | 1 file scanned 0%, and then after a few minutes i get an unspecified error. This has happened to me consistently for the past month on two completely different isp's, and has not allowed me to play for a majority of the time. It used to randomly fix itself, but it hasn't let up this time.\r\n\r\nI have tried every solution in the patcher issues thread, and every other solution i could find on the internet, including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Manually uninstalling my antivirus\r\n- Disabling my firewall (also tried adding exceptions)\r\n- Port forwarding\r\n- Reinstalling/repairing the client (i currently have League uninstalled, and the second i try to reinstall it i get the same issue)\r\n- The s_OK file fix (to no avail)\r\n- Deleting various files/folders (again, nothing happens)\r\n- Installing league of legends on a different HDD\r\n- Closing all programs (Skype, spotify, discord, chrome, EVERYTHING besides the patcher)\r\n- Switching regions and then switching back to NA\r\n- Using a public dns/ flushing my dns\r\n- Running as admin/ running using various compatibility modes.\r\n- Running the hextech repair tool\r\n- Installing windows updates/reinstalling net framework\r\n\r\nI have even contacted riot support, only to wait 2 weeks for a half assed automatic response telling me to do EXACTLY what i told them i already did.\r\n\r\nI'd like to believe this is an ISP issue (that's what everything is pointing to), but i find it hard to believe this happened consistently on two entirely different isp's.\r\n\r\nAll i want to do is be able to play the game again. I've included some pictures here, even though i'm certain everybody has seen this before:\r\n\r\nhttps://gyazo.com/9162fbdd1414a2e735d218ab0534b2d9\r\nhttps://gyazo.com/857cef73ff95d26d54cd7ebbdc9c1015\r\n\r\nAny advice is appreciated, though i'm not sure what else there is to try besides a clean wipe of my entire system.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-05T16:27:15.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you've already submitted a ticket about this, I strongly encourage you to follow up on that ticket and continue to work with your support specialist. Since they'll have direct access to system logs, they'll have a much higher chance of pinpointing the cause of this issue.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
