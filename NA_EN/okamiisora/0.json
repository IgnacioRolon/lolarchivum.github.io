I can open the store and click on the amount of RP I want to get, but when I try and choose Visa, Mastercard, etc. The client crashes.\r\n\r\nI've already tried repairing the client, what should I do?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-27T17:07:51.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you using any third parties currently?  Some apps like play.tv and overwolf have been causing the client to crash for some players, so removing those would be a solid first step.
