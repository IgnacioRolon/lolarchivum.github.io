I'd normally say Udyr, but top is kind of rough. He's more mana dependent than basically anyone up there. \n\nIf you want to be pretty unique, and really have to learn how to manage waves and your mana, go Udyr.  If you want to have an easier learning curve, play Tryndamere, watch some good players and learn how to perma-push. ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Sambers","date":"2016-12-30T21:48:30.501+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hell even riot knows {{champion:23}} is next level trash and endorses ppl to split push all game..","replies":[]},{"poster":"urgotdangit","date":"2016-12-30T16:07:13.163+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hmmm, you spelled Urgot incorrectly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"l Helios l","date":"2016-12-30T22:11:43.745+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:77}} \nPros:\nBetter sustain. Trynd has to build fury, then use it to heal.\nA stun.\nVariable build paths, full ap, full ad, bruiser, splitpush, teamfighter, etc\nBetter team fighter than Trynd due to stun\nVariable skill order.\nYou can still be useful if behind due to stun.\n\nCons:\nMana-dependent. You almost always need at least one mana item\nLower DPS compared to Trynd.\nNo dash for escapes, but high movespeed is usually sufficient.\nNo ultimate, so it can harder to fight some champions.\nNo real waveclear without getting Phoenix or a hydra item\n\n{{champion:23}} \nPros:\nInnate crit and synergy with crit.\nPretty decent waveclear w/items & E.\nInnate sustain.\nUlt. Self-explanatory.\nGood chase potential with slow and E.\nBetter duelist of the two.\nNo mana to gate him.\n\nCons:\nAll you can do is split. Team fights are usually fruitless.\nNo variable build path. You almost always want just full glass cannon.\nFalling behind means you're meaningless in every sense other than a distraction.\nVery predictable. You know what to expect from a Trynd in almost any scenario.\n\nHope that helps. It's up to you who you take, but that's how I'd evaluate it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bronze Bonanza","date":"2016-12-30T16:09:13.788+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot killed top lane Udyr when they removed his mana-gain on turtle stance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VivaLaKitten","date":"2016-12-30T21:51:05.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I top laned Udyr against a Darius and won,\njust follow these 3 simple steps\n1. kindly ask your jg for blue buff\n2. get denied blue buff, and kindly steal it from them, KEY WORD, \"kindly\"\n3. spam E, Q","replies":[]}]}
