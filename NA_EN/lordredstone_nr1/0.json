The last issue of [LUX](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/comic/lux/issue-5/0/) is here. There's not much happening, but it's still a deep dive into the lore.\r\nThis was a fun series to do, but I don't think I'll post about every issue for the following Zed comic. Of course, I'll always be here, theorizing, but I'll leave the big threads for someone else, especially since my exam in linear algebra is coming up.\r\nAs I said, the final issue revealed some interesting things we talked about the last time [here](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/JxmnMEGY-spoilers-lux-issue-nr-4-feedback-discussion-and-questions) and also [here](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/MGbnYxYu-lets-talk-about-the-big-armored-demacian-in-the-room).\r\nBut I'm getting ahead of myself, so I should put a spoiler warning here: \r\n\r\n# **_~~Spoilers! Last warning!~~_**\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n> # Summary\r\n\r\nhttps://universe-meeps.leagueoflegends.com/v1/assets/images/comic-series/luxcomic/Luxcomic-issue-5-link.jpg\r\n\r\nThe issue starts with the second-most awaited fight in popular culture (right after Cleganebowl): Garen vs Sylas. After some shittalk, Lux lets Garen know that his sword is dangerous if Sylas touches it, so he grabs a halberd from a guard instead.\r\nHe knocks Sylas down with it, who in turn takes magic from another downed rebel and blasts Garen with it. Behind him, Jarvan appears and holds him in a stranglehold. As Sylas frees himself, the fight seems won: Sylas and the mages scatter and retreat.\r\n\r\nLux, with her bloodied knife\r\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/611606335112347668.png?v=1\r\nthen follows Sylas and a group of refugees down in the sewers, but ultimately lets them go.\r\n\r\nWe then cut between the burial of King Jarvan III and the escape of Sylas through the sewers and into the wild. Jarvan IV now promises to persecute all mages with a force never seen before. And true enough, the mageseekers are back with even more power. Cui Bono?\r\nLux and Garen walk through the city and witness these incidents while discussing if it's \"fair\". Garen also reveals he was tasked by Jarvan with helping the mageseekers. Luxanna then has the idea to help the mageseekers in her position as Crownguard, but uses it as an excuse to take children out of the city. They lead her to a safe house in Dregbourne, where she finds a group of adult mages. Among them is the young girl from the first issue who was stopped by Garen. Lux proves to them she is a mage too and promises them a way out of the city. They leave through the sewers.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Garen interrogates another boy found by the mageseekers. He also enters the sewers.\r\n\r\nThe young mage gifts her staff to Lux, to remind her that she is a mage and a good person. When they reach the exit, they find it blocked by Sylas. The group turns around - only to find Garen behind them. A confrontation between siblings follows. Garen is clearly in denial, doesn't want to see that Lux is helping mages, but she then forces him to admit and say it. _His sister is a mage. And a Demacian._\r\n\r\nIn the end, Lux blows up the exit and Garen lets them flee. He reports back to Jarvan, even covering Lux. On the last panel, we see how Sylas regroups in the wild while we see Lux narrating to match the ending to the beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n> # People &amp; Places\r\n\r\n_*~~Lux~~*_\r\nhttps://universe-meeps.leagueoflegends.com/v1/assets/images/demacia-sketches/lux-demacia-sketch.jpg\r\n\r\nAll in all, I'm fine with Lux' development over the course of this series. She started to take responsibility and stood up for what she is. \r\nAs a wise man once said: _Let me give you some advice, mage. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor, and it can never be used to hurt you._\r\nHer staff is now there to remind her that she is indeed a mage and a good Demacian.\r\n\r\nLuxanna also now arrived at what I think is her canon personality. With the end of this comic, **For Demacia** and **Last Light** we now have three instances where she helps others, especially those \"afflicted\" with magic. This is what she does, helping Demacians and teaching them to control their gift.\r\n\r\nI assume she's not going to change a lot until the end of the arc - actually she might have reached the end here. Even if the upcoming Novella carries her a little further, she has a lot of content. Not only is her basic setup finished (Sona and Lucian crying in the distance), but she also appears in _two_ additional stories, a 5-issue comic and an animation, and that's not even counting a possible appearance in the first-ever League Lore novella.\r\n----\r\n\r\n_*~~Garen~~*_\r\nhttps://universe-meeps.leagueoflegends.com/v1/assets/images/demacia-sketches/garen-demacia-sketch.jpg\r\n\r\nThis issue revealed the truth we were all looking for: Garen's sun-steel sword is indeed the source of magic, not Garen himself. Since we already saw heavy hints towards Morgana in the last issue, I think it's safe to say this magic came from Kayle. Swain also hints that they _carry_ it into battle. \r\n\r\nGaren also shows growth in this issue: He can't repress his memories anymore, he has to accept that his sister is a mage.\r\nAnd he does not only that, but also accepts her as Demacian and then lets them leave.\r\nLater, in **For Demacia** we see that he's still processing all of it, but he knows that Lux is loyal and will do everything _for Demacia_.\r\n\r\nHe's not as far along his path as Lux is, but he also took an important step in this comic. Can't wait for that Novella to come around.\r\n----\r\n\r\n_*~~The Revolution~~*_\r\nhttps://universe-meeps.leagueoflegends.com/v1/assets/images/turmoil_bg.jpg\r\n\r\nI think the revolution is far from over. \r\nWe know that [Turmoil](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/turmoil/) takes place around one month after Sylas broke out, so if you haven't read it, do so.\r\nOne conclusion that we didn't know at the time is that the king in that story is actually Jarvan IV, since his father died here.\r\nIt also means that Sylas is still active out there and recruiting like in his [color story](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/sylas-color-story/). All in all I think this set up a nice foundation of the mage rebellion in Demacia for the writers to build upon.\r\nHow King Jarvan the _fourth_ now deals with the rebellion should be an interesting topic. Someone should write a book about that, idk a short one, not really a novel but something like that maybe...\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n> # Where are the Demacian champions?\r\n\r\nThat was a topic that [came up on the boards](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/8WKhW6xX-where-are-the-demacian-champions) recently, and I hope we will find out in the future.\r\n- Lux, Sylas, Garen, Jarvan IV, and Xin Zhao all appear in the comic or the [Aftermath](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/xinzhao-aftermath-story/) of it. So far, so good.\r\n - Shyvana, Galio, Kayle, and Morgana are all mentioned indirectly. Only Shyvana is a mystery, since the other three are _remain_ing inactive right now. Some of Jarvans comments indicate she left him? There are some issues that could be explored here, e.g. why Galio hasn't woken up with that many mages running around. Fingers crossed for the novella.\r\n- Quinn, Vayne, Fiora, Poppy, Sona, and Lucian are the Demacian champions that have nothing to do with the comic. I'll exclude Sona and Lucian since they are both missing parts of their lore, but these still are 4 champions we haven't heard anything of. Especially Quinn could be an effective weapon to the rebellion. Again: Fingers crossed for the novella.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n> # Continuity issues\r\n\r\nI've seen some confusion with the continuity / timeline. As I tried to clarify that [before](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/h8WdkUzW-demacia-timeline-garen-and-lux), I'll try that again with the new information we now have. The most important change from that post is that their ages in the comic are given with 19/25 ([Source](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/AsE2ETod-spoilers-lux-issue-nr-1-feedback-discussion-and-questions?comment=0010).)\r\nSince Lux uses her wand in **For Demacia**, it must be after the comic. I've heard people say it must be before, since she is basically an exile now, but I do think she can return to Demacia and continue work with the Illuminators / Radiant Ones. Maybe she'll even found the order of the Radiant Ones? After all, they would do exactly what she is doing in this issue.\r\nAlso, the scene from the first issue, where we saw the Great City of Demacia all but destroyed - when does that happen? We never saw it again in the comic, but it must be in the third issue, when she carries Garen to the infirmary of the sisters - after Sylas just blasted him with the magic of one of them.\r\n----\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n> # Open Questions\r\n\r\nIf you felt that the ending was not very satisfying, you'd be right! I was missing a climax too and furthermore, it (deliberately) left a lot of open questions.\r\n> Is Lux now forever exiled? How are they going to deal with the rebellion that basically just started? What about Quinn, Galio, Shyvana, Fiora, Poppy, everyone else? Who killed the king? Whatâ€™s the agrarian economic policies of the feudal economy? Why haven't we heard anything about the Illuminators? What would Taric think about his own country? How did that advice from the envoy of the Arbormark turn out?\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that this is not the end of Demacian content, we should see a Novella soon (tm). In that regard, the comic did exactly what it was supposed to do: It pulled me even deeper into the lore (if that's even possible), give me more! \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThanks again for sticking with me through this series! I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did. Next up is Zed as well as the Novella!\r\n######Did I tell you there is a Novella about Demacia coming?","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2019-09-11T19:49:34.406+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":1,"body":"> This was a fun series to do, but I don't think I'll post about every issue for the following Zed comic. \n\n{{champion:238}}  \"Do not deny me.\"","replies":[{"poster":"mrmeddyman","date":"2019-09-11T23:45:09.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WAAARGHbobo,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=81L6yHd3,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-09-11T19:49:34.406+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:238}}  \"Do not deny me.\"\n\nWho's writing the Zed comic btw.

She has no survival or organizational skills, so she would be useless as a leader and her speeches sound pathetic to someone who really has their and their loved ones' necks on the line. \n\nTeach them magic? They were obviously more or less familiar with their gift since they formed a community long before shit hit the fan, so her freshly learned lessons would probably be nothing they don't know - and they may be even better at hiding since they didn't have a rich family to cover their ass.\n\nMotivate people not to go with Sylas? What does she have to offer instead? Be nice and follow the rainbow? She doesn't have compelling arguments against joining Sylas aside from \"He's bad because he used me to avoid death sentence :(\". \n\nNow, Sylas has been handled really poorly as well. He wasn't shown as a caring or charismatic leader and 80% of his lines are just 50 shades of \"swine\". Even the concept of him being a bad leader was undercooked - it was literally one frame suggesting he surrounded himself with mages to use them as his batteries, but it went nowhere and even little miss Perfect {{champion:99}}  didn't bother to mention it. \n\nAlso, that entire scene with trying to make {{champion:59}} eat a rat was really cheap and the authors shouldn't have kept mentioning it. Seriously, Sylas, you have enough bulk in you to throw a fully armored man over your shoulder and you're so thick crossbow bolts get stuck in you.

I still think it should be some time after the comic, that would fit better with their ages.  It's said to be 7 years after Garen began his training with the Dauntless Vanguard.

Prior, Garen left to train for the dauntless Vanguard at 12, now he leaves to train at 12 but doesn't get offered up to it later. This would mean in his prior lore this occurs when Garen is 19 and Lux a bit younger (Their age difference in Pre-Sylas Lore was only 2ish years if I recall), and I still think this might be the case (unless Riot wishes to clarify). This aligns correctly with Jarvan IV being 18/19 when he returns with Shyvana, this age was before only implied before, calling him very young, but it is now specified that this all occurs the same year after he \"comes of age\" which is most likely 18. This worked at the time. However, as you point out, Lux's lore has been retconned significantly and she won't have her wand, and yet, the prince, and likely his friend since they met at similar ages, is still 18/19 in this comic and so it must occur several years prior to Sylas escaping.\n\nSo yes, as you say, the story NEEDS heavy editing or maybe Riot to confirm that it isn't the same wand, just maybe a random fighting staff.","replies":[{"poster":"LordRedStone Nr1","date":"2019-09-14T00:02:09.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right about the previous iteration, but we know now for sure that Lux is 19 during the comic, and Garen is 25.

This is based on the fact that they were partners in the military training and that Jarvan was 6-7 at a time were Lux was not born yet.\n\nIn his [biography](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/champion/garen/) it's stated that Garen was recommended by his aunt to join the Dauntless Vanguard aged 18 or maybe 19.

(Less importantly, but there is also still a remnant of Jarvan and Garen's older lore where he was captured by Noxus and he was thought dead by Garen. Since this never occured in the new lore it could simply be removed but it's not big, one could just reason he feared for just a day rather than the months it was in the older lore.)\n\nAnd I imagine Jarvan is not much older than Garen if at all.

Also, spies are cool. Womp womp that's it's all gone now.)  I want to see what's next for her, and am very worried about how many people outside of Garen and Tiana KNOW she is a mage.  The last issue, where the mageseekers or doctors were asking her about the magic that knocked out Garen, were their surprised faces because she said it was her, or because someone busted through the door? (How do we read comics?) And what is this novella I'm seeing teased here?!?!?!?!?!!  I want.\n\nGaren....I'll wait for the next development.  This comic certainly gives him more depth than a FOR DEMACIAAAAAAA! quarterback/jock type, but i'm not sure what's next.  At least we know for sure it's his sword that's magic, and that he's not in complete denial about Lux being a mage. He wasn't that interesting to me before this comic, but now he's just a little more.\n\nJ4, meh.  I'm not surprised that he's acting like a complete ass after his lover leaves (what happened to Shyvana?), his betrothed that he's then settling for skips out on him to hang with a criminal, said criminal escapes because of her ( the ex-betrothed), and then in the ensuing rebellion his father is killed. I don't like it, but i'm not surprised - that's a lot of \"bad\" to deal with in quick succession. Demacia is the \"no magic\" land after all, and these events would reinforce that for the un-magiced and Demacian zealots alike. I thought that even the way he was drawn looked darker (but again, how does one read comics?) What is his age here?  He seems immature, and not ready to rule. I'm not sure \"he's doing the best he can,\" can't he take like, I dunno, a couple minutes and think things over?  He can forgive Zhao (not sure how to [link to Aftermath here](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/xinzhao-aftermath-story/)), does he need to fight the entire country to figure things out? The only thing he was taught about ruling was warfare and getting married and having babies? Come on dude!!!!!!!!\n\nSylas, for me, became a whole lot more unlikable during the course of this comic. I was kind of excited to see how the rebellion would play out when he was first released (hi Demacian Bad Boy!) but seeing how it started and how unlikable he is, just, no. I didn't read him as a villain at his release, started to during [The Recruit](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/sylas-color-story/), and that's cemented now.  He's not a good dude. \n\nSpeaking of dudes, WHERE GALIO AT?! He likes Lux, but I've often wondered how he deals with being a magic-being in the land of no magic.  How much knowledge of self and surroundings does he have? He still wants to protect Demacians, but I don't think they would do the same if they knew how he actually \"worked.\"  All the sads.\n\nNot sure how to end this, but a big question for me is who killed J3.  It's blamed on Sylas, but who did it really?  Someone who has it out for mages possibly?? Or just someone rooting for unrest in Demacia?  The world may never know.","replies":[{"poster":"LordRedStone Nr1","date":"2019-09-12T00:53:32.610+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm actually not sure if there is any new official information regarding the Novella, other than \"it's coming\".\nIt was mentioned in the \"Universe in 2019\" video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqRxNzp9yCI\n\nLux - I completely agree. This feels like another retcon of sorts, even if we know it gets added back in. Spies _are_ cool.\n\nJarvan should be around 27 maybe? He's in the same age range as Garen as they trained together when they were younger, but Jarvan seems sure he could defeat him. (I doubt that. Maybe he was able to do it when he was 14 and Garen was only 12?).\nRight now, Jarvan's decisions are driven by (justified) anger. The question is, how much longer? Will he stay a tyrant for all of his life? I hope that Shyvana eventually comes back and brings him to his senses.\n\n----\nYour links look fine, but for the advanced stuff you can look up the [Boards Markup Usage Guide](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/mouP6um4-boards-usage-guide-part-1-boards-markup)","replies":[{"poster":"raquiavelli","date":"2019-09-12T01:21:42.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty!

I still enjoyed it overall as they were released but I felt they were a bit shallow for re-read value and the art is not THAT impressive for Marvels work and it was only a few issues with large breaks in between... so there should have been a large period of time for development and illustration.\n\nSorry that this isnt the most positive review but I am hoping for more 'oomf' in the comics for the future.","replies":[{"poster":"AbiwonKenabi","date":"2019-09-12T21:32:03.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"J4: this is not how I expected things to go for him. I assumed he would be the one to steer Demacia in a more tolerant direction and it was his father that was hesitant to make large changes, especially considering J4's ready acceptance of Shyvana and to some extent Quinn. But...I guess its pretty much the complete opposite huh? Twists aren't always good, especially when the setup has been suggesting everything but the twist. I think I kind of agree with you that the changes aren't my favorite, but with not knowing who killed J3, I am still interested to see where they go with it. I don't like the recent developments, but I'm not so far gone that new developments might change my mind. \n\nLux: I think the reason she doesn't feel like she changed much is that she pretty much became the Lux we know in the game and in some of the stories she's featured in. So to us, her change didn't feel like much because we are so used to (and love) this version of Lux. At the beginning of the comic, Lux was afraid of herself and what her society would do to her. Now, she's not scared, she's determined to stand up for those who need her, which she believes is the Demacian way. \n\nGaren: Taken as a whole, I think Garen ended up being a pretty good character. I was afraid at the beginning he would just be the \"no Lux\" character, and stubbornly not listen to her the entire time. But thankfully, he changed his ways, but in a natural way. Again, not a ton of \"oomph\", but I think that was because we expect Garen to stand up for Demacian ideals (like protecting citizens and being honest, honorable, etc) but he didn't really start the series off like that. Even Lux was disappointed in him, and that was kind of what made him realize his mistakes. \n\nSylas: pretty much no development, I agree. At least, nothing beyond what we already knew had happened. Unlike the other characters, who got SOME development, Sylas was all set up, no real payoff in the confines of this comic (his best new contribution was \"please tell me one of you killed this guy, because I didn't...\").\n\nI think the reason you are disappointed in the Lux issues is (in my opinion) it all felt like setup for some other story. We pretty much knew how the events were going to play out, and while there were some exciting developments along the way (Garen's development and J4's development in particular) we didn't really fully feel the extent of the consequences of these developments. J4 got the most drastic change, and its a change you didn't like. So its no wonder you're disappointed.\n\nI have high hopes for Zed, as unlike the Lux/Sylas situation where we basically knew what happened, the Zed/Shen situation has many details missing. So in theory it should fill in a lot of blanks with (hopefully) exciting new things (plus Jhin maybe...?).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"IlyaK1986","date":"2019-09-12T13:43:29.149+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Really didn't like this comic compared to warmother.

Of all stories that could have been told about Demacia, it felt like we got the blandest one possible, starring the blandest characters that had to be carried by Sylas's sheer force of personality.  \n\nAnd I voted squarely for the Zed comic being better, because ninjas could be very badass if done well, especially considering it may take place during the Noxian invasion, so there can be god knows which stories told.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Berry The Shovel","date":"2020-01-09T13:20:58.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you guys think that Garen will join our boy Sylas?

But nope, we got a throw away line of dialogue about her. Maybe.

And I guarantee you that when the Shyvana VGU comes out in 3 years it'll completely undo any lore we've latched about her at all.  Like, I still hate she's not a half-dragon anymore, but a horrible mutated magical abomination a mage morphed a dragon into. Yuck. \n\nIt's honestly hard to care about any of this lore at this point.

Who killed Jarvan the third? Personally, i think the black rose is involved because in history, they never missed a chance to create chaos that would benefit themselves and their payers (which means Noxus in this case). \nAs for the champions that weren't involved, we could come up with excuses for them. Vayne is hunting for monsters, Quinn is a scout that probably is in the borders, Poppy is searching for the Hero and Fiora apparently is drinking her tea while Sylas is wreaking havoc outside. \nNow, I thought about Galio myself and how useful he actually is for Demacia. He did not wake up when an entity consumed all the magic that has been absorbed by Demacia's walls and thousands of mages fighting so, is when will he wake up? Do we have to wait for Morgana and Kayle to fight in Demacia again for him to wake up? Or he will wake up in the future (and will fight for Demacia and thus we saw it destroyed in the first issue)?\nAnd now that I think of it, what will Sylas do now? And what will be the future relationship of Demacia with the mages guild (outside demacia, can't remember their name) will they cooperate and so Sylas only hope would be to flee either to noxus or somewhere further away to be saved? Or will Demacia turn hostile against that guild and they will have to fight Sylas and them?","replies":[{"poster":"4 Step Cadence","date":"2019-09-12T12:00:03.818+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"The Zed comic will feature Zed, Shen, Akali, Kayn, Jhin, and another character on the cover.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hunkmenlordy","date":"2019-09-12T11:16:51.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why this series has anything to do with Taric","replies":[]}]}
