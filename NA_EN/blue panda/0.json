It really seems like it's much less frequent. Most ground-targeted lingering AOE effects like this do a good job of almost instantly applying their effects, look at Cass's Miasma, Singed's Mega Adhesive, or Viktor's Gravity Field.\n\nI'm almost certain Soraka's E updated much less frequently than other skills.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Afic","date":"2018-06-06T22:21:16.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not sure of the specifics, but ya it updates on some cadence, which is what caused this to happen","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2018-06-07T03:43:49.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When other spells have behaved inconsistently in the past Riot has taken steps to make them more consistent.

At high enough resoultion, it's easy enough to forget that there even _is_ a medium between you and the content.\n\nOne more realistic thing that RuneScape could do, which would still be a ton of work but hopefully a lot less than retooling the whole game, is upgrading the systems for specific instances. A lot of boss fights are instanced anyway (held in a separate universe from the rest of the game, possibly even a separate server) and they could improve the underlying infastructure for ONLY those instances - I would play a RuneScape where the boss fights and _only_ the boss fights ran on a much better system. Add keyboard commands for movements, get some super solid low-latency servers for bossing, and I think the experience would be 10x as good.\n\nThe biggest problem with upgrading RS, is that the playerbase is super cheap, entitled, and fetishizes veteran players so far that even the League players whining about rune changes and sunk I.P. would be like \"Woah those guys just played the game from earlier, they're not gods...\". It's a super common problem for aging MMOs, where a solid portion of the consistent income comes from people that believe that the new player experience should be every bit as shitty as theirs was, for the rest of time, which makes it really hard to make useablility and anti-grind changes, and puts a lot of pressure on the devs to keep awful \"legacy\" mechanics, because \"Well if I had to fight the controls rather than the boss, everyone should have to! And what's with the game being so damn _fun_ now, back in my day it was a grindy snoozefest, as it should be\".\n\nTl;Dr  RuneScape has a lot of good still left in it, and plenty of options for improvement, they just need to avoid the super tempting trap of weighing long time players' opinions too highly.

It seems odd, given that there are grounded zones as well which I'm guessing would have this same edge-case functionality that probably isn't ideal.\n\nI'm guessing it's just that those sorts of abilities are slightly newer additions, and infrequent enough that this edge-case has been allowed to persist?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Afic","date":"2018-06-07T16:33:44.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"probably because of deep rooted game flow/design decisions that made the most sense at the time.

There are optimizations, but the basic problem is since the player is not directly affected by the silence, you have to check far more often than if the silence sets a flag directly.\n\nIt's just far more efficient to set flags during server ticks.  I imagine there are edge cases where someone might be able to get a cast off in between server ticks, but if League is running at a tick rate of 30Hz (from what I googled), that's a pretty small window of time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-06-07T16:36:44.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Afic,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=LWYEdcRP,comment-id=000300020000,timestamp=2018-06-07T16:33:44.967+0000)probably because of deep rooted game flow/design decisions that made the most sense at the time.
