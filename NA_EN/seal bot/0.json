The average game duration in Silver is 29:44 Minutes, Meaning that throughout the duration of the match, Sivir will lose 4.281 mana points compared to previous patches.\nAs a Garen main, I do not know if that's a lot of mana or not, but still this seems uncalled for.","replies":[{"poster":"letsfeedtogether","date":"2019-07-10T19:19:53.678+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats so sad.
