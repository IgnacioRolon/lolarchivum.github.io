That was intentional. This time, my computer crashed when we entered the loading screen. I was unable to load in the game so my team ended up remaking. I understand why I got the penalty. What I do not understand is why it is 20 minutes long. I thought when you first get a penalty in a while, it is only 5 minutes long. Please, I would like to know why the leaverbuster is 20 minutes long.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-21T22:41:47.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) treats all leaves equally regardless of intent.  This is because all leaves still cause a negative experience for other players, but you can recover from it simply by playing through the required games.  Also keep in mind that you won't get this penalty with just one leave but with a history of leaving.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"AJRA2k16","date":"2017-01-22T03:45:33.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I highly respect this punishments.I currently have a 20 minute leavebuster but it was due to a \"black screen\" issue for which I cannot do anything about.I know well it is a bad experience with fellow players in League but some of the players will disconnect.I also think leavebusters should be around 5-10 minutes.I think that would bring more joy for players and more people to play this great game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azrael005","date":"2017-01-22T00:13:06.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now I'm hunting for riot responses. I would like to see some kind of statistic regarding reports not related to verbal abuse/hate speech doing anything.  The trolling is rampant and the amount of people who do it because their enjoyment is derived from baiting responses over playing the game is bullshit and god forbid you have a duo que doing it because the way the game is set up you are punished for walking away from a situation like that with no way to just end the game other than take the leavebuster. With how often this comes up I'm fairly convinced that everything but hate speech and verbal abuse is a laughable waste of time to bother reporting .","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gold2Stun","date":"2017-01-21T13:02:22.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's permanently 20 min  once you had the 10 min leaverbuster","replies":[{"poster":"Goblin Bot","date":"2017-01-21T18:04:05.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Gold2Stun,realm=EUW,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=ii4bhvn2,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-01-21T13:02:22.932+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s permanently 20 min  once you had the 10 min leaverbuster\n\no i see","replies":[]}]}]}
