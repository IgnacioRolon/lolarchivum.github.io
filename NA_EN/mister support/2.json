And this I somewhat agree. There are plenty of matches where if some lane starts to get in trouble, I can&#039;t do much to affect it if my allies don&#039;t have the damage to follow up with any peel or engage I make.\n\nNow, I&#039;m not going to suggest going some full damage support or ask Riot to make supports outright stronger, because that is just hopeful and stupid (supports are not meant to deal damage, they are meant to support allies in one aspect, usually in utility). So instead, I&#039;ve been thinking and experimenting a bit to find out what silly thing randomly works way too well from normal. And I&#039;ve found it!\n\nNow, this is where a LOT of people will disagree with me. But my idea is simply one little change...take smite. It can be {{summoner:3}} {{summoner:11}}  or {{summoner:11}} {{summoner:4}}  or {{summoner:11}} {{summoner:14}}  it&#039;s situational, but just hear me out.\n\n1. Smiting wolf and raptor camp are great when it comes to granting or removing vision. DO THIS IN THE ENEMY JUNGLE, NOT YOUR OWN. It will starve the enemy jungle and help your entire team, especially with the wolf smite, since it is guaranteed to tell whether or not the enemy is in that portion of the map. Raptor camp is essentially a free upgraded sweeper for vision denial as well. Also makes taking Scuttler easier.\n\n2. Can pressure dragon without needing your jungler. If you are able to force the enemy lane out of bot, you can turn to take dragon fast.\n\n3. Can take jungle camps very fast to get you and your carry ahead just that much faster. Or if you have some clear, take it for yourself and give yourself that gold and experience you&#039;ve always wanted.\n\n4. {{item:3706}} and {{item:3711}} are surprisingly decent items for support use. One of them will add to pick or peel potential, while the other is essentially a replacement to {{item:2049}} . And the upgrades are very nice whether its {{item:1409}} or {{item:1410}} .\n\n5. Strong mana regeneration early game just for sitting partially in the jungle after picking up {{item:1039}} .\n\n6. Potential to smite steal away the buff camp from the enemy jungler at level 1. (all games I&#039;ve done this successfully so far).\n\n7. Ease of 20-minute baron. A second smite, no explanation needed.\n\n8. Provides a good source of catching up in experience in the mid-late game.\n\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2131197824/215026110?tab=overview\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2130713185/215026110?tab=stats\n\nNote for both of these games, my overall vision control by view of wards was better or on par with the enemy&#039;s, but look at the number of monsters I took directly from the enemy.\n\nHere's a Braum game: http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2132100173/215026110?tab=overview\n\nNami: http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2132149740/215026110?tab=overview\n\nNautilus: http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2132306410/215026110?tab=overview\nWhat do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"OurLestrade","date":"2016-03-21T17:09:45.174+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds pretty interesting actually...

It might work on chill games, but it's very easy to predict and work around if you're a good player, since if you take smite you will lack either ignite or exhaust (or both) making your laning phase a lot harder. Also if the enemy knows you have 2 smites, the enemy jungler will problably expect you to try and do something, meaning that if he's smart he will snowball other lanes and leave bot alone sicne you will not be able to trade thanks to the lack of exhaust/ignite, giving his bot lane an advantage and more control on the fights, als if you lose the enemy will snowball a lot harder since you won't be able to stop them nor fight them (thanks to the lack of these {{summoner:3}} {{summoner:14}} two guys). The smite upgrades are good, but gren smite is not a really good replacement for ss, you need at least 3 wards when playing support, and green smite gives 2. Blue smite is not bad since if you want to catch an escaping opponent it's better than exhaust, and jungle items tend to offer nice stats at a relatively low price, but it's still not completely worth.\nAll in all I repeat: it's a refreshing thing and probably a fun strategy if you're with friends or are against an unsuspecting opponent, but that's just it, a cheese strategy. Still will upvote since it looks like a lot of fun to mess around the enemy jungle with smite as a support ^^.","replies":[{"poster":"Mister Support","date":"2016-03-21T20:19:24.633+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Read the context...the only \"cheese\" about this is possibly trying to take the enemy buff camp early.

Weighing the benefits of both and deciding that overall it's better. And even with green smite in most of my games I'd have more or the same amount of wards placed.","replies":[{"poster":"Valexfor","date":"2016-03-22T19:04:55.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I read the context, and I explained to you that it only works on unprepared (or stupid) opponents. There is a reason if this strategy is not used in professional play: it's a cheese strategy.\n\nYou take ignite/exhaust insterad of flash: You will die most of the times if the enemy is at least a bit smart, since he will know you probably won't be able to escape an all in engage.\nAlso smite has less fighting potential than exhaust/ignite, so if you want to take flash for safety you won't get anything done early.\nIf with green smite you have the same amount of wards that means that you either waste 10 minutes every game going back just to get the extra wards you need or you don't take red trinket (so you can't deny vision) or you just use 2 wards every time, meaning you're not warding enough (unless you play with someone you know and he's helping to ward, since most adc don't ward even when you ask them to and they have 2 stack of yellow trinket).\nAlso if you take smite the enemy jungler will also know that you will probably try to fuck up with his jungle, so he will probably start bot (effectively nullifying your smite, unless you want to leave your adc alone for a lot every time you want to smite something, and that's not too smart nor efficient unless you're already winning, which is hard since you will be weak to all ins and will probably have to play passively), and will probably just clear his jungle bofre ganking since from the second clear onwards every jungler has a decent enough clear that he can clear a portion of his jungle before every gank usually.\nalso utill you upgrade smite you have a useless summoner (smite). the only good thing about this is the possibility to contest a dragon/baron better, but that also weighs on yor bot not beying too much behind (which will probably happen since you can't fight), else the enemy will just kill you first then take it (if they're not dumb).\nAlso machete and talisman are good only in the jungle really, and upgrading them costs more than ss, so you effectively get less for more gold (150 hp and 1 ward) and will have less goldsince you won't get any extra ambient gold, meaning that this strategy really starves you unless you manage to get some good early kills (and even then, it's just on par with the normal support builds in my opinion).\n\n\nAfter this analysis (as you can see I did take into account a lot of things, I'm not just saying it's cheese since I like the word) we can say: this strategy works only on unprepared and/or bad players. And what's a cheese strategy? A strategy which works only on unprepared/bad players. So this is a cheese strategy. That said I actually find it funny and refreshing so, even if it might not work too well against a good team, it's worth to use it just for the funny scenarios and interactions it might have. That's why I upvoted, hope you realize my analysys better now and understand why I call this a chesee strategy.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2016-03-21T23:58:06.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"It was explained to me a while back why replacing Exhaust with Chilling Smite isn't so great an idea. Chilling Smite is massively inferior to Exhaust when peeling, something very important in the current sated/devourer jungler meta. Leaving your ADC alone for the time it takes to run into the jungle for that mana regen is a really risky idea unless you KNOW your ADC can stay alive without you; I personally don't trust my marksmen alone for any longer than it takes to ward river. You wouldn't be able to get jungle items until after your gold item, and since a lot of their value is tied into bonus damage/gold against jungle creep kills, it's cost ineffective on a class that already gets shit on in the income department. Plus until you get the actual chilling smite item, you have a summoner spell that's basically only good in lane for stealing CS (unless you have a Relic shield, though besides Thresh no one should have any problems proccing the execute).\n\nI'm not saying it doesn't have value. But all the value of a Smite support build is in mid-late game in a meta where games are more and more frequently decided in the early laning phase, where your Exhaust/Flash equipped enemy support will dance all over your ass.\n\nSide note, your teammates will likely flame the ever-living shit out of you for doing \"TROLL SUMM OMG\" in champion select.","replies":[{"poster":"Mister Support","date":"2016-03-22T00:31:22.164+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't know how many times I have to say this...I REPLACE FLASH MOST OF THE TIME, NOT EXHAUST, IT'S SITUATIONAL WHICH I WOULD REPLACE IT WITH.

I've also been able to use smite on a cannon minion to proc relic from a distance which healed my carry when he got caught and leveled him up which made us get a double kill bot, so it can turn the tide of a fight even before the upgrade if used right.

It's a neat idea in that it makes the own support's recovery pattern better (opening up jungle exp and gold as a source of goldstream for them) but it actually hurts the recovery pattern of the rest of your team (unless you're solely jungling in the enemy jungle, I guess) as it removes potential exp/gold from them and funnels it to a role that statistically scales the least with items. It's a neat idea and all, I just don't see the strengths outweighing the weaknesses except in super specific cases.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ltmetal","date":"2016-03-21T20:57:11.326+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a jungle main, this post speaks to me.\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Mister Support","date":"2016-03-21T21:54:33.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do explain, I don't see how this is nice to junglers aside from smite being involved.","replies":[{"poster":"ltmetal","date":"2016-03-21T22:04:33.770+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It makes it more appealing to be a support secondary if you are ordinarily just a jungler.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Looknook","date":"2016-03-21T19:59:12.129+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wanna try this on Bard now.

With the current mobility creep in this game, a flash isn't going to save you shit if you don't have a dash or something to follow it up with unless you flash under a tower. If you are in the middle of bot lane and Udyr comes running in at mach 5 landing a chilling smite, you can flash twice if you want, but you aren't going to make it back under tower without getting stunned and losing atleast 70% health when enemy ADC/Sup catches up. \n\nI honestly believe they're making so many hyper-mobile champs to demean flash as a summoners spell. Yeah, you get to dodge a skill shot once every 200 seconds, maybe make a jump over a wall. But what is Soraka gonna do after she flashes over the wall and Trist, Kha'zix, Leblank and Jarvan leap over the wall after her, and Leona tags her with a well placed Zeneth Blade to fly through it too?","replies":[]},{"poster":"delonix","date":"2016-03-22T05:11:29.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very cool.

Typically will start a gold item, then get the initial jg item {{item:3706}} or {{item:3711}} , then finish the gold item, whether it's mixed with SS or not, then finish jg item (with boots somewhere in there). Then continue the build normally. If you want could wait to get cinderhulk third or fourth so the hp bonus is stronger once completed.\n\nIf you want to steal the enemy jungler's first buff, I do this, after the initial leash, go to just outside of the enemy buff camp, wait until you notice your jungler going on his own buff camp, then count to 3 or 4, and walk close enough to smite, and run out. Don't stay, that will get you killed. For taking full camps, either take your carry/jungler with you and let them have the gold, or wait until you see the enemy jungler in the opposite side of the map from the camp you are taking, and try to be a level where you can actually take it without having to wait 50 years. If it would take you to long, then just smite the large monster for the benefit and leave. Try to keep one smite up so you have dragon pressure.\n\nSince the camp you will take most is wolves, you won't always \"steal\" important camps from the jungler, since most people just ignore that camp aside from the first clear. The big difference comes if you smite a camp away that you see the enemy jungler working on, because then you made them waste resources just to give you free gold and experience.\nThe biggest thing I noticed was I put the enemy jungler 1-2 levels behind ours early game if I was successful in what I was doing.
