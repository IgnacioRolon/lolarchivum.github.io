Sounds to me Like Yasuo speaks a language that's the bastard child of Chinese and Korean, which then had a child with Japanese. Karma's Mantra quotes, however, sound more like a variant of Hindi. If they do expound upon these, I hope they tell us where each language is spoken and how both ended up in the Ionian vernacular.","replies":[{"poster":"Ultîma","date":"2018-04-27T19:12:26.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've shared those thoughts too, and my main take-away is that Karma's Mantra quotes are ancient Ionian, whereas Yasuo's quotes are in the modern Ionian tongue. Although after reading Riven's story I'm not so sure anymore. One of my key issues regarding the linguistics of Ionian is that we still don't really have a map of Ionia itself - is it a country or a continent? I'd find the differences in dialects a bit tougher to swallow if Ionia happens to be only the size of Demacia, for example.","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Shingetsu","date":"2018-04-27T20:12:08.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Excellent question. I could absolutely see it being a sort of Australia, where it's a country as well as a continent. There's precedent for cultural divisions already, with the Vastaya, so it's very possible they'll say Ionia is a continent that's come under the unified rule of an Ionian government, and there are different sub-cultures within that have different original tongues.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Qiyana Hime","date":"2018-04-27T02:18:59.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any chance you could have him post that again, using notation from the International Phonetic Alphabet?
