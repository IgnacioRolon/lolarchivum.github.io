Seirously {{champion:14}} is really old of a champion model. http://www.lolking.net/models/?champion=14&skin=0 that is a model of sion at the moment IN GAME. Not is only that bad graphics compared to Leagues standards but there is another factor that barely ANYONE notices... http://wallpapers.brothersoft.com/league-of-legends-sion-111571-1152x864.html this is his splash art. Notice the axe? I swear Riot, I love ya but... seriously... it's just so baisic yet so sad to see this mess up. Ok so if noone could see that what the problem was and still is... it's the fact that his axe has 1 blade in his spash art and 2 blades in his in game model. Please Riot, you reworked {{champion:54}}  and now he is EVERYWHERE... Sion is never seen anymore and i feel if you guys tinker a bit with his model and/or spash art he will be loved in the same fashion as Malphite is.
