Animations and other visual effects may be updated, but the champions model and core theme are untouched. In some cases, the kit rework will \"correct\" the kit to match the intended theme. alright now i'll tell u who will get a kit rework; the next champions who will get a kit rework are: {{champion:114}} , {{champion:3}} , {{champion:112}} , {{champion:83}} , {{champion:6}} , {{champion:122}} & {{champion:41}}. so thats all for today, i'm ChrisBlitz, add me if u like and keep up the work riot and tomorrow or next time i'll talk about who will get a kit rework and a visual upgrade and i will also talk about it...until next time","replies":[{"poster":"Derptard4life","date":"2014-04-24T01:50:26.641+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Warwick and Karthus are next...","replies":[{"poster":"ZenonTheStoic","date":"2014-04-24T20:11:49.657+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Warwick's not next.

Also, {{champion:114}}  Fiora, {{champion:3}}  Galio, {{champion:112}}  Victor, and {{champion:41}}  Gangplank might be underused, but dont require a rework due to their almost specific team utilities they provide. as for {{champion:6}}  urgot and {{champion:83}}  yorick, i kind of agree with you, but there a a good bit of champs that need a full rework first. Personally, i think {{champion:28}}  Evelynn should get a texture update and and have her lore redone, but no real ability changes are needed. As other people said, i think {{champion:30}} Karthas is next for full redo of both abilities and models.","replies":[{"poster":"Tortferngatr","date":"2014-04-24T20:29:19.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Karth isn't getting a kit rework; his case is probably going to be more like the Heimer VU.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChrisBlitz","date":"2014-04-24T11:05:00.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes i know that they are new some of them but this is the list that riot said that they will have a kit rework, and they did a kit rework to {{champion:107}}  and he's still to some people, right now they are working on {{champion:6}} but u do prove a point here and {{champion:30}} is going to have a visual upgrade, not  kit rework...yet","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"walkinasasin","date":"2014-04-23T20:23:41.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"actually i am pretty sure if you watched the pax {{champion:29}} update preview you would know that {{champion:30}} is next or very close to next","replies":[{"poster":"ChrisBlitz","date":"2014-04-24T10:54:01.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well Actually {{champion:30}} is going to have a visual upgrade, not a kit rework yet","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tsiddique","date":"2014-04-23T22:41:04.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't see why Darius or Fiora need reworks.
