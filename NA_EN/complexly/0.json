All you do is sping around and ult when you see the mark... \r\nThe reset of ult is really fucking stupid. He is already strong with bleed and then he has a reset with ult? \r\nPlease nerf Darius.","replies":[{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2015-08-27T13:45:32.650+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"nerf darius?! lol hes pretty damn weak right now actually. his changes compared to garen and skarner are nothing. Darius will get slight buffs in the near future  guaranteed. hes not nearly as strong as he needs to be, to be a viable pick consistantly","replies":[{"poster":"shadecrapper","date":"2015-08-27T14:33:07.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, compared to them.

Skarner is the really broken one. I charged in 1v3 at the enemy because they were near my spire, I was 1 full item and 2 levels behind..
