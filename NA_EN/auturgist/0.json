I forgot Smite and tried to Alt-F4 so my team could remake...","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I usually jungle. I hadn't the game before, and forgot to switch summoner spells... when I saw that I didn't have Smite after loading into the game, I was going to play it out until someone mentioned remaking, at which point I decided it was fair to quit so they could do that and not lose LP. I quit out of the game right before the 3-minute mark in hopes that they would be able to remake, and logged back in much later to find it prompting me to reconnect. I did and they told me they weren't given the option to remake the game after I left. Obviously, they got smashed, and afterwards, I honored the whole team because it was fucking stupid that they lost LP for something totally outside their control, and they were all cool with me, I assume because they knew it was an honest mistake and I tried to do the right thing by them. When I went to queue for my next game, I had a 20-minute wait time in low priority. Thanks, Riot. I actually tried to do the honorable thing by my team and got punished for it. =/\r\n\r\nIf NOBODY on your team has Smite, the team should be able to /remake IMMEDIATELY and the person who was assigned the jungle role should take the fall. This is a fair way to handle this problem. Obviously, people in any role can take the wrong summoner spells, but Smite is pretty unique and essential to junglers, and people shouldn't have to play out games when nobody on their team has the summoner spell that allows them to do such an important job.","replies":[{"poster":"WUVCdisPp2","date":"2016-10-20T21:42:47.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol you screwed your team twice.

The /Remake system will flag any player who is marked *inactive* for 90 or more seconds within the first 3 minutes of the match. If anyone was marked, a remake vote goes into effect at 3:00 and will need 30% of the team to pass. If the vote passes, the match then ends and the players marked by the system will receive a loss penalty.\n\nCheck out our [/Remake FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ) for more details.
