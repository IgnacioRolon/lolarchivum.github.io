His pc wasn't even online\r\n\r\nI'm Silver 4 btw.","replies":[{"poster":"Jango Mage","date":"2016-07-31T17:52:48.403+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The same thing happened to me in Ranked not so long ago.

The /Remake system will trigger once someone has been inactive for 90 seconds or more within the first 3 minutes of the game. It doesn't seem this match was eligible for the /Remake, which is why it wasn't an option in the match.
