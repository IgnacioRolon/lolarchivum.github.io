I cant even ctrl+alt+del out of it. The only option is to hard restart my computer.  This doesnt happen with any other games I play. It happened once while I was surfing the web, but league was open in the background looking for a match. All of my drives are updated and I do not run any 3rd party software while I play League. I also blew out my keyboard and replace my mouse batteries just to be sure. The computer is less than a year old. This has caused me to receive leaver buster multiple times and is becoming very frustrating. Dont think I should be punished for something that is 99% likely to be leagues fault but that is neither here nor there. I see someone else had this problem years ago but have found nothing on it recently. Is anyone else having these issues with the beta. Its never happened before I installed it. Any suggestions on something else it might be on my end? Any input is appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-22T19:43:58.294+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your config may have become corrupt.
