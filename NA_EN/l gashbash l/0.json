I was wondering if the same happend to me too. My friend who was in the same match is having the same problem as I am. I was just wondering that if i wait for the duration of the game and try to reconnect will that fix it? or how would i go about not being stuck trying to reconnect to a game that i know is finished?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-13T18:35:20.381+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like a ghost game, which you're right, it could take a while for the server to pick up that the match ended.  Sometimes restarting the client can help force it through, otherwise you may need to give it some time to update.","replies":[{"poster":"l Gashbash l","date":"2017-12-13T19:50:00.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I figured it would probably just take some time for it to be fixed but i'm glad that I KNOW now that's all it'll take to see it working again. Thanks for the info/help man.","replies":[]}]}]}
