First, if you and your family don't feel safe contact the local authorities. Second, if you have screenshots submit them over to our [Player Behavior Team](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), so we can investigate this player further and work to stop this.

The guy could be a known sex offender, have previous arrests, have a shady history and more. As someone who used to deal with really bad cyber bullying because of my sexuality, do not take anything for chance. People can be whoever they want behind a computer screen. If he is willing to act this way towards your sister than he has no problem doing it to someone else. If anything call your local authorities for peace of mind.","replies":[]}]}
