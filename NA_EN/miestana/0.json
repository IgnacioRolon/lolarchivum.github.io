I even factory reset my pc to see if that would work. but nope..nothing. didn't work and now I'm being punished every day. and then to throw more salt on an open wound, it force repair will stop at 3525 and then stay there for like 5 mins before it keeps going and then it will start going again and then stop. then after it stops at 35mb of data left for 5 mins..it will then do a scan of all the game files yet again. this problem needs to be resolved asap.\r\n\r\nCrash Report #172268649\r\n\r\nThank you for reporting your crash with BugSplat!
