In order to do this:\n\n1. Make sure you are signed into League and are on the Client\n2. Open your installation of League:  C:/Riot Games --> League of Legends --> Config\n3. Find the files game.cfg, input.ini and persistedsettings.json and delete them.\n\nOnce you start a new game, everything will be set to default which should hopefully resolve your issues.  Let me know if the problems persist!","replies":[{"poster":"Thegnoblar","date":"2016-05-27T14:25:17.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have a mac","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-27T22:57:35.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The steps are ssentially the same, but you have to find League in your Applications folder.
