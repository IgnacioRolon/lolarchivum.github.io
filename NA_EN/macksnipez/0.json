Toxicity is not fun to deal with once it gets to extremes. But perma banning accounts for toxic text chat seems excessive. Maybe they should implement a system that disables chat or limits the chats per-game once a person has hit a certain threshold of reports or gets one serious one such as the insta punish phrases. I know, people will still troll without chat. But that's when they get reported for inting or grieving and that leads into the perma ban. Text chat doesn't disrupt gameplay as much as people like to think. Another post used CSGO as a perfect example. They don't ban for text or voip, but grieving and disrupting gameplay does receive punishment. I'm not saying it's a perfect solution or a perfect system. But when you get banned for hurting people's feelings it's a little much. There is the case of insta punish phrases and I definitely agree with those catching hard punishments, but just telling someone they are playing bad or are acting a certain way shouldn't be grounds for a punishment","replies":[{"poster":"korppi tuoni","date":"2018-05-31T19:47:22.752+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SirBarthoIomew,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=WvPHFjc3,comment-id=000100000000000100000000,timestamp=2018-05-31T03:31:22.398+0000)\n>\n>Maybe they should implement a system that disables chat or limits the chats per-game once a person has hit a certain threshold of reports or gets one serious one such as the insta punish phrases.\n\nThey do.\n\nDid you even read Riot Tantrums post? This was this guys **5th** punishment, which means he went through 10 and 25 game chats restrictions and it didn't change his behavior. There's an escalation process which gives you warnings, chat restrictions and suspensions, perma-bans are the last resort after everything else has failed. \n\nNever escalating toxic chat beyond chat restrictions is just hurting the already toxic community we have to deal with. Why should anyone have to deal with this dude between his chat restricted games? Why should I have to fuss with the mute feature because this guy wants to run his mouth? What actually helpful comments or pings am I missing because this guy tilted our entire team and now I have to mute everyone? How many other people are gonna become toxic because sticking to chat restrictions only is basically just neutering any control Riot has over the community?\n\nEveryone coming back from a 14 day suspension is warned, this is your absolute last chance anything else and you are gone for good, and not a month later this guy was right back to his old ways. So now he knows and all of you in this thread knows, Riot is absolutely serious, they will ban you, then when you whine in forums Riot Tantrum will smite you and we'll all laugh. So now this guy can suck it up, put on his big boy pants, create a new account and learn how to /mute all or more likely continue to cry about how mean Riot is and how horrible this community is and take his toxicity elsewhere.","replies":[{"poster":"Poetguy78","date":"2018-05-31T22:17:48.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, they've said that they tried just chat banning rather than full banning, and the people permanently chat banned tended to start behaving toxically in other ways.","replies":[{"poster":"SirBarthoIomew","date":"2018-06-01T02:02:06.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SirBarthoIomew,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=WvPHFjc3,comment-id=000100000000000100000000,timestamp=2018-05-31T03:31:22.398+0000)\n>\n> But that&#x27;s when they get reported for inting or grieving and that leads into the perma ban.\n\nText shouldn't lead to a perma ban UNLESS it's a insta punish phrase. Otherwise, chat restrict/chat ban them and if they don't get the memo, perma ban. Yes, it doesn't give all the white knights the satisfaction of getting someone perma banned off reporting every meanie in chat, but it would negate these \"I got banned for typing things that hurt someone's feelings\" posts that keep popping up.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2018-05-30T08:11:01.572+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":">MackSnipeZ: botlane\nMackSnipeZ: i advise you\nMackSnipeZ: not to die->they died twice(context)\nmy botlane flamed me after i said this.\n\nIt was wrong of them to flame back, but seriously?
