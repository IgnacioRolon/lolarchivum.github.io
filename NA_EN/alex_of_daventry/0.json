The said reason for it says a lot about the game&#039;s current state, and where it could possibly lead. I have gotten a lot of flak for doing something different, and get no apologies, or anything when it actually works. If you are going to enforce a meta so hard, it is going to kill innovation, promote toxicity, and keep the pro scene boring as fuck to watch with the same 6-7 champions being picked over and over again. It&#039;s not like the singed is trying to lose, not communicating, or trolling. They are trying to find new fun and creative ways to play your game, and you&#039;re killing that? Why? League of Legends is probably the MOBA with the most possible versatility in how you can play the game, yet you are squashing that by enforcing a rigid standard of how people should play, making the customization pointless.","replies":[{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2016-11-20T14:02:30.441+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"Except the reason for the person in question getting ban wasnt for playing off meta. Im not sure how much more people need to say it. He was ban for not communicating to his teammates of his intentions. Let alone the fact that in game he didnt actually help his team (especially the ADC), nor did he play the role he queued up with. If anything we can all assume had he actually communicated with his teammates (and i mean actual communication not copy/paste and forcing your teammates to do what you do) he wouldnt have gotten punished. It was never about him playing off meta!","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2016-11-20T14:04:26.197+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think a rioter has to sticky Wuk's post to the top for a bit until this all blows over.","replies":[{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2016-11-20T14:36:34.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TyrekGoldenspear,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=JbIpi3ux,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-11-20T14:04:26.197+0000)\n>\n> I think a rioter has to sticky Wuk&#x27;s post to the top for a bit until this all blows over.\n\nProbably at least for the time being, but like with Dunkey and Tyler i highly doubt it would help since most people would ignore it!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChargeItDownMid","date":"2016-11-20T16:43:13.204+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"The Sword Saint","date":"2016-11-20T16:58:26.995+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=haaaaaaaalp,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=JbIpi3ux,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2016-11-20T16:43:13.204+0000)\n>\n> That is flat out untrue.

They say no we need a support and he double jungles anyway. That's bannable, new champ select enforces the roles you get when the queue pops unless your team is Ok with you switching. They were not and he went double jungle anyway.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Sword Saint","date":"2016-11-20T16:56:41.883+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Another post on a subjectg by someone who did the minimal research. He wasn't banned for playing singed support, he was banned for queuing as support and playing second jungler singed instead despite not getting permission from his team, ever, over many many games. That's it, the new champ select system enforces that you must play as the role you are given when the queue pops unless your team is OK with you playing some other role. His teams were not because they needed a support, and he played double jungle singed anyway.\n\nCase closed, no wider implications, no 'enforcing meta', just enforcing the champ select system. Move on, nothing to see here.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-20T17:38:16.018+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"Enforcing the champion select system is enforcing the meta, what are you on?
