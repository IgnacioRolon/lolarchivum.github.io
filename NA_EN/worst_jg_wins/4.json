You should not be allowed to ruin others' games with lasting score changes just because you can't be bothered to try that game. If you are legitimately dying twice every minute on average (and not just stacking MS and running it down to the enemy tower) then you have either picked up a champion for the first time into their hardest counter played by a onetrick (in which case why are you first-timing in Ranked, especially without having at least glanced at a guide first), or you have no concept of how to play even remotely safe and are going to keep feeding the enemy for the entire game through sheer bloody-minded stubborn-ness and belief that you can make no mistake.\n\nI'm not saying roll this out to Normals or Bots, because there has to be learning space somewhere, but to come into Ranked and manage to die that much, you deserve a ban for what you are doing to the poor bastards who are forced onto your team and their MMR+LP.","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2019-10-18T04:43:02.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Plz quote me saying kda of 0.5\ni know exactly what you said and refred to excatly what you said.

Not every champion has range or aoe damage to easily farm under tower and some champions that do are limited by small mana pools.\nWhat im saying is that your formula cant prove inting (as inting is a mind set not just gameplay actions). And if you punish people for doing badly score wise you end up just making solo que even worse because no one wants to get banned for protecting allies because they might die. you just get even more adcs fed out their mind but not touching the enemy tower becuase what if i die those 125 melee champions not walking up to the tower to auto in but are pushing the entire enemy team to the back of tower range and are body blocking for me so i wont touch the tower either despite my 400+ range  that can easily safely shred this tower.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2019-10-15T03:55:39.491+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"camp top lane dive him constantly hes a a 10 death spree at 15 minutes the enemy FF's despite that the top isnt worth gold after his second death becuase tilted idiots only look at numbers without context into how they actually impact the game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-10-14T23:48:40.555+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wouldn't inters just simply stay under 1 death per 2 mins?
