Then a few of the forum warriors came in and started spouting false statments and saying nonsense response that weren't productive and factually false. Then the mods deleted it because  those few forum warriors came in spouting factually false info and picking fights with everyone. HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO do with the OP. So someone who spent a good amount of time writing a detailed explanation of why he doesn't like the current state of the game and was upvoted by like 80 people got his thread deleted because people that disagreed with his opinion came in and started \"slap fighting\".

Now, before you say that jungle experience is demonstrably too low, keep in mind you have yet to offer any proof beyond [appeals to authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority) (X jungler says jungle sux), [argumentum ad populum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority) (everyone says jungle exp is too low) or [anecdotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_bias) (I saw a game in which X happened). \n\n>Also is \"slap fighting\" a technical term or are you \"slap fighting\" with me?\n\nObviously it isn't a technical term, but a phrase I use when two or more people are arguing past each other. \n\n> Is typing with emotion or flair against the forum rules?\n\nAgain, hyperbole. Those things aren't forbidden, but they do often interfere with productive discussions. \n \n> Does typing with flair make a discussion about gameplay stop being about gameplay?\n\nDepends on what you mean by \"flair\". When we review a thread, quality of discussion is an aspect we consider. Bickering, antagonistic responses and resorting to common rhetorical tricks and logical fallacies all reduce the quality. \n \n> Why do you cherry pick comments out of a thread.
