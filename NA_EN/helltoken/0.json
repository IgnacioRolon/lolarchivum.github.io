They are essential items to his build.  Yasuo's ability to get on to carries while being fairly tanky is what makes PD so strong on him specifically, and mallet combined with his dash makes it impossible for even the most slippery ADC to get away from him.\n\nOther common PD users, vayne, trist, even graves, can't really jump straight to the backline without risking getting blown up trying to get there.  If the PD passive was, say, a mini-malz passive, or a stronger but more situational 50% dr when cc'ed, it actually helps squishier builds who can be locked up and eliminated in a single cc, but a guy who has a longer time to kill gets less out of it because he spends a lower percentage of the fight cc'ed or initiating and has a higher uptime of just soaking damage.","replies":[{"poster":"TFBaam","date":"2016-08-21T19:19:48.031+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:102}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:24}} all use {{item:3022}} and ranged ad if they feel like making enemies suffer ik that {{champion:36}} has it as offensive ec\n\n{{champion:41}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:107}} some melees that use {{item:3046}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"l Helios l","date":"2016-08-22T01:24:40.720+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah Mallet is extremely frustrating to deal with because it almost ensures there's no escape beyond flash, and that may not even be enough.

Percentage-wise fervor is vastly different for the two.  \n\nFor example, a full build ashe would typically have almost 360 total ad, factor in 70% crit and an ie and that ashe is doing about 775 damage a hit.  While using flurry boosts it to almost 1050 damage a hit.  Fervor is on hit so doesn't crit, and adds 112 damage.  Right under 10% increase in damage.\n\nNow, full build bruiser Yas has 175 total AD.  With PD he's at 30% crit, so roughly 220 damage on hit average factoring his passive.  He attacks at least 1.7 times a second and q's every 1.3 seconds with the TF proc every 1.5 seconds, assuming everything is 100% optimal in a 15 second fight he gets 25 auto attacks, 11 q's, and 10 TF procs.  That's 4000 damage added from fervor and 2200 damage added from spellblade with the breakdown even further of 7900 from total AD, and 1100 from q's bonus damage.  So add it all up and you have a little over 26% of his total damage coming from fervor and a little under 15% from spellblade.\n\nTL;DR, Ashe gets about 10% of her damage from fervor.  For bruiser yas it's over 25% of his damage.
