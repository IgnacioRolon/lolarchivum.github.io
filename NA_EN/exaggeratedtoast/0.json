If your connection hiccups a lot during patching, it can miss or damage certain files and then needs to repatch like this at the WORST of times. \n\nTry to make sure you use a steady connection, possibly switching to ethernet while downloading these patches or repairing. You might also want to go through the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a precaution too!","replies":[{"poster":"ExaggeratedToast","date":"2017-12-11T14:06:00.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you,\n\nill see if i can make it less of a problem on my end, i do click send error report so im sure you got your end covered xD","replies":[]}]}]}
