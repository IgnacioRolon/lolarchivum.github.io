From my investigation, it does seem like you were in your promotion series to Gold 1, but you queue dodged the 3rd game of the series, which counts as an auto-loss.  Since you lost one time before, it automatically kicked you out of the series.  It does look like you got back into your series afterwards though!  Best of luck in your climb! :D\n\nI hope this helps alleviate some confusion.

And a free win is cool, but there is always a chance to win the first time without needing the free-win, and if you dodge for the free-win, it still doesn't guarantee you'll manage to reach promos a second time.\n\n(As a side note, about the second point: the problem is certainly real, but I think the practical severity of it is overblown...

If you did that wouldn't it mean you lose both your promo series (since you need 100LP to be in a promo series) AND 3 LP, a much bigger loss then what you're complaining about?\n\nAnd, frankly, I'm fine with your last issue. I'd rather you go through with playing 2 games to their loss then 1 to get the free win.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-05-10T13:43:21.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The 3 LP loss could be postponed until after the series.

What happens if you dodge 5 times in a day before finishing your promos? According to the wikia wiki, you lose 10LP for each dodge after the first each day, so you could end with -43LP. That sounds like an auto demotion to me. So. you win your series, and then automatically get demoted because your LP lost from dodging is now applied? That doesn't sound fun and sounds like a \"hidden\" penalty, since (atm) you can't see LP when you're in promos (since you're at 100). Also, your point about starting higher then 0 LP is also wrong. At least, the official FAQ doesn't mention this, nor does the wikia wiki.\n\n> And about the 3rd point, I don&#x27;t even understand what you mean...\n> But consider the current situation. For instance, if you win 1, lose 1, dodge the 3rd, you won&#x27;t have a free win next time. If you just lose 2, you&#x27;ll get it. Why would someone with 1 win in their series shouldn&#x27;t get the free-win the next time, but someone who just lost 2 games should?\n\nBut, here's the thing, why dodge the 3rd game in your example? You only hurt yourself. There are three scenarios that could happen, you play and win (resulting in a promotion), you play and lose (resulting in lost LP and trying to get to your promos again), or you dodge (resulting in lost LP and trying to get to your promos again). Even if you got the extra Promo Helper win in the latter, it still doesn't seem worth it. You just got a guaranteed loss, as opposed to playing it out and seeing how the match goes.\n\nHonestly, I say that it should be in place because I want people to play out games. I tend to avoid surrendering most times, I hate having to dodge and avoid it like the plague, and I just want to have fun. That's why I want someone who went 0-2 or 1-2 in their last promos to get the bonus win, rather then someone who went 1-1, 1-0, 0-0, etc. with one or more dodges.\n\n\nUltimately though, Riot wants to discourage people from dodging, because honestly it leads to a bad experience for those involved. It also doesn't help that many people define trolling in Champ Select differently. I know I rarely encounter it, and other people who see the same stuff as me may say some things were trolling when I wouldn't. But that's a separate conversation all together.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-05-10T15:46:37.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We must have problems communicating with each other...\n\n> Your stuff about dodging 5 times during a series\n\nThat's an unrealistic scenario, and if it did happen, the person would deserve the insta-demotion. Sure, it would look like a hidden penalty, but a small loss of clarity in an unlikely case is well worth an improve for the more common cases.\n\n> Also, your point about starting higher then 0 LP is also wrong. At least, the official FAQ doesn't mention this, nor does the wikia wiki.\n\n I never said you start with higher than 0 LP...\n\n\n______\n**MORE IMPORTANTLY...**\n\nI said many times that I don't like the 2nd point / that I think it's exaggerated but that **I DO UNDERSTAND** why it's needed. My problem is that the 3rd point on top of that is adding insult to injury and has no reason to exist at all, **because unlike the 2nd point it cannot be abused**.\n\n> But, here's the thing, why dodge the 3rd game in your example? You only hurt yourself.\n\nBecause someone is toxic in the lobby and you don't want to have a bad game? Like, you know, for every other dodge ever? When you dodge, you always \"hurt yourself\", even outside of promos. But sometimes you just don't want to deal with sh-t, and you dodge. You can disagree, but that **is actually Riot stance**, and that's why the first dodge only has a small penalty... except when you are in promos.\n\nSo maybe **you** don't want people to dodge, but Riot has no problem with it. The 2nd point was added to protect the competitive integrity of Ranked, but the 3rd point should not have been put in place, it's not consistent with the rest of Riot policies...","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MrRazzleDazzle","date":"2016-05-10T03:54:25.688+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"It still baffles me that promos force you to play with toxic players or take the insta-loss and dodge.
