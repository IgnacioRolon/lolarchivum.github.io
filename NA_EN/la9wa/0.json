This reply is not beneficial to morgana nor zilean but it does have to deal with a passive on another champion. What if Nocturne's passive scaled in cooldown? I've noticed over the past year a couple of champions have received these changes to their passive for example aatrox's passive cooldown was 225s CD and now it reduces to 225/200/175/150 at levels 1/6/11/16, Shen's passive cooldown was reduced to 9/8/7 at levels 1/7/13 from 9 at all levels, and evelynn's passive re-stealth time was reduced to 6/5/4/3 at levels 1/6/11/16 from 6 seconds at all levels. Currently nocturne's passive is at 10 seconds and does not scale in cooldown at later levels. Something as like changing his passive cooldown to 10/9/8 at levels 1/7/13 would be a fitting change.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Archenz","date":"2015-08-10T00:42:31.423+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about this?\n\nSoul Siphon :\n\nMorgana's damaging spells each sap mana from all enemies hit and replenish her mana by half that amount.\n\nE.G.

Her mid game is not strong enough to justify also having a weak early/late game.\n\nLately I've taken to playing her jungle since it lets her get relatively safe early farm and still have a strong mid game.

Thus rendering her innate spellvamp only 1/3 effective because of this on HALF of her kit. \nBefore anyone says anything, Tormented Soil and Soul Shackles can both deal more damage to more people than Dark Binding (Her only single target spell) Just as a general note.\n\nYeah...to me her passive has always seemed rather counter intuitive because of those points.

Akin to the WOTA revamp passive.\n\nActual numbers and balance features would need to be tested obviously, but this helps mid AP morg significantly more than support morg, because\nA. Mid Morg builds more Ap, and thus gets the better spell vamp for higher values, and it doesn't benefit support morg much at 'all'.\nB. Morgana often times snares, then follows up with autos and soil. A support morgana leveling snare first has the biggest 'spell vamp' target already done by time the autos are in place, but a mid morgana leveling soil to clear would get more benefit from the 'true spell vamp'.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-08-10T03:31:53.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if her spells slightly lowered affected champions' MR, similar to Kayle's passive (since they are both... ya know)?\n\nHer Q, being single-target, would reduce it a lot more (its duration might need a nerf in that case, but it would certainly put someone in a bad spot if binded!), and her W would just reduce it slightly to zone the enemy out. \n\nBut eh, I guess that might be a boring passive?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fadedpf","date":"2015-08-10T01:31:51.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well you also have to worry about giving her a strong passive when she is already effective at doing her job.
