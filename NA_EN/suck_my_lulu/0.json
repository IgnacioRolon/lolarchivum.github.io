You just run around, and farm. Nothing fun about that. The idea of fun is someone like Ekko, Yasuo, Kled, Zac, and many more with outplay potential, but maybe I'm just being too nick picky at this point, but to me, Singed isn't fun to play at all, it's almost as worse as Nasus.\n\nSo if I see a proxy Singed on my team, after the game, there is going to be a complaint filed more than likely against him from me, especially if he's intentionally feeding and assisting the enemy team by trying to triple proxy cause that's what he's doing. He's empowering the other team over his team, denying them of CS, letting the enemy team get ahead in CS, experience and gold.\n\nI do not have a problem with lane Singed, but even then, it just isn't a fun pick, and not useful.
