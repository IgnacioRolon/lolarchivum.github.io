Pool Party Taliyah can do a lot of things. For Q, Taliyah can throw water balloons and can pop and splash off. W can be a surf board bouncing the opponent off of it, and saying &quot;Wipeout!&quot;. E can be water balloons placed on the floor and can pop and splash kind of like Q. The ultimate can be a BIG pool that has pool stuff surrounding it. When u use it, u can surf and water can splash all around. For the passive, Taliyah can surf onto the walls of the map, and a small wave can be behind and water splashing on the left and right, like a regular wave. IF u take this concept, please give me the skin for free and Taliyah 2. :D.
