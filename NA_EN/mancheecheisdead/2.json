Instead of his ULTIMATE changing positions of another champion, why not do something that does damage or takes away someones ult for half the cooldown it usually is, then urgot can use that ultimate of his opponent or something. That's my opinion. But I agree with all of these people.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gibberwatt","date":"2016-06-11T23:21:25.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I would have already tried urgot if not for one thing. I mean, he has homing rocket thingies and a shield, and a slow, and that cool ult.  HOMING ROCKET THINGIES.  HOW COOL IS THAT!\n\nBut his splash art is just blech.  If I got battlecast in hextech, I would probably give it a shot.  But without that, I cannot make myself deal with his splash, or with his ingame look.  \n\nWhat I'm saying is that I think that if he got a visual rework, his playrate would go up.  I mean, taliyah's winrate is about 36, and people still play her (partly because she's new, but also cause she's got a pretty cool kit, I think)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-06-11T23:16:25.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rework him obviously. \n\nRiot can't just delete a champion from the game. That would just be controversial (and I'm not saying this because I think all champions belong. If I could choose champions that were never made, it'd be Vladimir and Irelia. I've hated them for at least a year now). \n\nThey have tried reworking Urgot, but each attempt hasn't hit a satisfying mark.
