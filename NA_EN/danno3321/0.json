And how do the servers work?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I was playing League earlier today, just trying to get the feel for a new champion, when randomly my game tries to reconnect. My game wasn't lagging before this happened, at least not in that game, and before I know it my game is stuck. So I restart the computer to try and figure out what was going on, but when I go to log in again, there was an alert that said, \" Connection Failure: Unable to connect to the PVP.net server.\" It had a link to look at to try to fix it, but my computer is a mac, so it did absolutely no good. It was working just fine only hours before this, but then this happened.\r\n\r\nNext, I looked up the server, trying to figure out if it's down for everyone and not just me. The North American server, the server I think I'm using, was working fine, but a server called the Public Beta Server had login down on the site I checked.\r\n\r\nLastly, I checked the router I was using. It was working just fine, and I know that the router isn't the issue, because last time I tried to play while the router was down the launcher wouldn't even open.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to know is, what is the Public Beta Server? And am I wrong in thinking that I'm on the North American Server? Am i actually on the Public Beta Server, whatever that is, and if so, can someone please explain how the servers are divided? If you know anything, I would really appreciate if you shared it in the comments below, if not, thanks anyway.\r\n\r\nSorry if this is all just some newbie mistake and I'm missing something obvious about all of this. I haven't been playing for all that long, but I know my way around the game. I'm just clueless about the way the servers work.\r\n\r\nTo those of you who aren't having issues, if it's not just me, good luck out there and remember to have fun!\r\n\r\nI will be leaving this discussion up and open even after the issue is fixed as a place for others who have this issue and are as clueless as I am, should this happen again.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-01-10T06:33:38.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Danno3321,\n\nAfter reviewing through your post, it does appear that there is a healthy amount of confusion regarding this issue.  Please keep in mind that North America and the Public Beta Environment (PBE) are two separate servers or 'regions'.  In order to access the PBE, one must specifically apply, get accepted, and then use a new account in order to log in.  Therefore, it does appear that you were playing on the normal, North American Server.\n\nIf you are still experiencing issues entering the main client on your Mac, then I strongly recommend that you open a new [Support Ticket](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/tickets/new)\nand make sure that you include the following information:\n\n1) A \"System Report\":\n- https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/23242306\n\n2) A Network Analysis:\n- http://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/20103436\n\n3) A Process List:\n- http://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/23258202","replies":[]}]}
