I&#039;ve been playing her a lot and i think, YES she is strong, but you also need to be an experienced player with her. I just don&#039;t want her to get nerfed bc people at higher elo can play her to an extent where she is broken like Azir. I think the current Taliyah is PERFECTLY FINE, her kit takes skill to use and you can tell a very big difference between a good and bad Taliyah.","replies":[]}
