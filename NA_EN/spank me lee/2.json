Rageblade gives Jax what is no less than STUPID amounts of stats for him to kill with. It's the reason why Riot nerfed the cost and will probably nerf it a little again next patch. math says that the total value of the stats of Rageblade at max stacks is worth twice the gold of the item. Twice.\n\nit's the most cost efficient in the game. Now Yasuo's passive makes it so that all crit is twice as efficient on him, but that's only until he hits 100% crit. After that, every ounce of crit has literally 0 efficiency. it's filling a full cup and does absolutely nothing. Yasuo's kit \"WAS\" also balanced around his passive while Jax was not balanced for it and rageblade was not balanced for him.\n\nRight here we see two instances of situations of items having twice their worth, but rageblade displays full value at every stage of the game for every champion. Yasuo's passive displays full value until his crit is maxed, and then is worthless the rest of the game.\n\nSo really, like i said, these situations may look similar, but in fact they're not even close.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hayaishi2","date":"2015-11-26T02:44:54.777+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"Everyone with Sated is cancer.

I neve said that everyone should see it that way, I only explained that when an item is strong on many champs it's the item so you should complain about the item, not the champ but, when a champ gets to abuse an item that is only good or average on others and isn't made for him, that's a problem with the champ.

That said, everyone can complain, but you won't be taken seriously if you complain about the wrong things (like about jax op with sated, Aatrox, Xin, WW, Noc, Shyv, any champ that uses it becomes op, so it's better if you say: devourer op than saying x champ is op when everyone isop with it).
