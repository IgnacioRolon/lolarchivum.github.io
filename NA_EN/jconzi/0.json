I enter champ select everything works fine then after champ select is over the game crashes and i cant reconnect. It was working fine until about a week ago where it would work sometimes and then crash sometimes but once it starts crashing it carries on for awhile. Because of this i have also accumulated 4 20x5 minute bans in 3 days and i just entered a ranked game after it working fine for awhile then the game decided to crash and im probably going to get another ban. Someone please help me.","replies":[{"poster":"Destinyswake","date":"2016-10-06T06:31:35.050+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im bug splatting out on a Desktop pc, been running window's 10 on it 6months now, and it only recently started bug splatting after last league patch.","replies":[{"poster":"Destinyswake","date":"2016-10-06T06:37:53.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I may have found a solution, but it only works for those on Nvidia right now, go into Geforce experience, into theGames and then click the Details where you would optimize the game, set it to a pixel resolution that works on your screen, then change it to Windowed, bordeless.
