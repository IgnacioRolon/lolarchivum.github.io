The reason why it even has a cooldown reset to begin with is because it feels really bad to ult someone only for them to end up dying to your team before you can reach them. Then you become completely useless. Zed's ult already has plenty of counterplay, and there's plenty of times where you can use it by mistake and get punished for it by the ENEMY team; you shouldn't have to be punished for using it by your OWN team.","replies":[{"poster":"Crowe Stalker","date":"2015-08-28T12:53:34.416+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much this is why this argument is flawed in my opinion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Chode I","date":"2015-08-28T13:01:10.614+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"So because the Zed player will feel \"really bad\" for messing up his ult...

Its a waste regardless.

You can't compare that to Zed's ult. Tons of people can die before Ori's ult finishes casting, and it can still catch someone. There's literally zero need for it to reset just because it didn't kill anybody. Zed's ult resets because it has more than enough counterplay for the enemy team, there's no reason for it to also have counterplay from HIS OWN TEAM because they kill his target before he finishes casting his ult. Untargetability doesn't factor into this.","replies":[{"poster":"Very Hard Engage","date":"2015-08-28T16:31:09.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"but what you aren't grasping here is that zed can use it to his advantage, ori actually roots herself to use the ultimate for the chance* that they dont just flash out or use their escape tool in the .25seconds. \n\nim not saying just because he doesn't land on the target you shouldn't have an ultimate at all, you still gain up to 3 seconds of invulnerability from pressing R. and if the target dies you can have more than 3 seconds of untargetability, and you can abuse it because \"if you get caught out\" you stay alive longer, and your team comes in blasts the CC threat thats on top of you and you can do it again on the proper target whom you do mean to damage/burst into the ground. \n\nTHATS unnecessary.\n\nwhy should you get a second chance while others dont? you already have a below average CD on the ultimate making it available in any team fight or on any roam. \n\nin addition you have to deliberately choose a target and press R, if you make a mistake, that should be your fault and put the ult on CD like any other champion.
