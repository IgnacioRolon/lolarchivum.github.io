This hasn't happened before, I tried repairing the client, I disabled the xbox DVR thing the one guide said as well. I checked around my computer to see if anything was weird and I found nothing. Usually in game I have my fps capped at 120, so it's usually always at 120. In the past couple of days it's been around 40-60. The only time it went back up to 120 was for like one game after I updated windows yesterday. So I'm not sure if it's maybe on the clients side or something? Any help would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-18T01:13:29.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's kind of weird that your FPS would drop just because of that update. There might have been some settings that changed during the update or drivers that became outdated. You should be able to get those frames back up by going through the steps in our [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting). Be sure to check your drivers especially, but hit all the steps if that doesn't seem to help!","replies":[{"poster":"Decrypticzz","date":"2017-04-18T05:47:56.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No I'm not saying it dropped because of the update. I think my fps was actually just better in a custom game because it was only me. Like I said this just started randomly happening, and also OBS has randomly started dropping around 30% of frames. Any chance this might help narrow it down? I've been trying a lot of different things.","replies":[]}]}]}
