(To be fair, this makes sense since South Korea has the best internet in the world and Korea as a region is extremely competitive by comparison). \n\n\n\nAnyway, as an East Coast player, I can verify that I do not enjoy trying to execute difficult mechanical plays when my ping is constantly above 100.
