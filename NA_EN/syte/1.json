Because this bug doesn't break the game, Riot could have at most put up a disclaimer not to play Ryze or disable him. They do not owe you a hotfix for some champ whose absence doesn't really matter.\n\nAlso, like someone said, it might be a really complex bug. If you were here in the old days, I think Shen was banned from competitive for a year or more because they couldn't reproduce a bug, I think it was that he would sometimes not TP to his target after his ult.

You can look at any credible lol stat history site and see this for yourself. But Ryze is really strong in the right hands, you might say. Well the dude who made this post this is a 3 million mastery point diamond Ryze OTP and he's not happy. I'm at 1 mill only and frankly Ryze feels shit to play after the last 5 nerf batches or so. Yes Ryze works in the right hands, I've heard it over a thousand times by now. But that's the very definition of \"right hands\" because if it _didn't_ work it wouldn't be the right hands. Anything works in the right hands. \n\nI have been a Ryze main for literally over a third of my life thus far and been through every iteration with the exception of alpha Ryze. And I stuck with him in his darkest times of 37% win rate, never ceasing to play him. I simply do not give a damn how weak Ryze is actually. But for all these years playing him, it's never been more unfun playing him in his current state. And it only seems to be getting worse.
