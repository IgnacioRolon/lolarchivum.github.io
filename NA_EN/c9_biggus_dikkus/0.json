The new Ryze combo for max damage is Q E Q W Q E Q. Nothing actually changed there (but note that to do that fluidly you need to approach 40% cdr).\n\nHonestly, I do really miss Ryze's old ultimate. I can't really make the new one work, I feel it's clunky and unintuitive. Furthermore, it doesn't reset Q as old ultimate did.
