I put a lot of work into figuring out some of this for runes for my own build and found out one useful bit of information:\n\nArmor in LoL doesn't give a flat bonus.  It actually reduces the amount of damage you take based off your HEALTH and ARMOR.  Building armor is great, but unless you are building health too at a rate of (personal estimate here, but seems to be good) of about 750-1000 health per 100 armor.  It also helps to build up mana and MR because you can build {{item:3075}}, {{item:3065}}, {{item:3110}} and {{item:3083}} and end up tanky as hell.  If the enemy gets a bunch of armor pen that is making you take more damage then focus on health and not armor.\n\nSince armor is based off health you NEED to keep a high health with it, armor alone will not help.  Using armor alone is why people complain tanks melt.  Build a ton of armor and HP and you will be really tanky.\n\nEdit: http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Armor for more information\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"dEAdbUs","date":"2016-09-30T02:52:36.741+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Playing tanks with 300 armor and 3.5k hp.

However, damage reduction has amazing synergy with health, and so it is a good idea to get health and armor/mr\n\nfor example (with nice numbers)\n\nA champ with 1000 health takes 10 hits to kill (each dealing 100 damage).  A champ with 1000 health and 25% reduction in damage from armor takes 14 hits to kill (each effectively doing 75 damage due to the resistance).  A champ with 2000 health would take 20 hits.  A champ with 2000 health and 25% reduction would take 27 hits.  In order to match this number, a champ with 1000 health would need about 67% reduction.  Due to the way armor scales, it takes a lot more armor to get to that point.\n\nThus, resistance is better with higher HP because it takes more hits to deal enough damage to kill you.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Zudane","date":"2016-09-30T06:38:07.955+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I'm not sure where all the information you got is from, but I got mine here: http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Armor which has the same formula that I find on any other site.\n\nI did word it wrong a little bit, but I was trying to get the point across.  If you take reduced damage then it takes more damage to kill you: that means you have a higher effective health.

My point from the same comment you replied to says that you should be sitting at +1500 health or more and at +150-200 armor.  And then look at the fact that the enemy team had 3 people with {{item:3071}} and 2 of those also had {{item:3142}} .  The armor penetration on those items means that your armor build is EXTREMELY inefficient because for each point of armor you gain you lose half of it in a team fight automatically.\n\nSeriously, re-read my statement, the one you commented on. If you were to go for more health over armor and followed my suggestion then your build should have been:\n\n{{item:3068}} {{item:3025}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3083}} \n\nWhich at 4 items gives you +1800 health and 115 armor.  At 4 items we area already nearly 700 HP higher, and we aren't even done yet.  Remember that armor penetration, so armor is effectively at half benefit (not really, but the game is complex, so this makes an easy decision) and it makes it worthless to buy more armor.\n\nI'd then suggest go go for something aggressive (maybe even earlier, especially if you're top lane) and take {{item:3748}} for an extra +450 hp and damage based off your max health.  Now you can hold your own in a fight.  Boots... maybe you could use them, I'd say Ninja Tabi if you go early on, otherwise you might want {{item:3158}} for the CDR.\n\nThis way you'd have well over 5k health, be dealing a ton of damage from it (5 + 1% maximum health at 5k hp = 505 damage per hit + more in a cone behind) and still some armor and MR.\n\nNot trying to call you out on it, but you said all items had HP, and out of 6 items only 3 did and Deadman's plate wasn't even built.  So, having a shit ton of armor against a high damage team with armor penetration will lead to a tank melting if he doesn't switch to mostly health.

You're using a representative value to gauge the true value of a statistic. \n\nThink about it this way:\n\nAs far as damage reduction goes, 0-100% is not as 'small' as it seems. Its not just 0 to 100. Its 0 to infinity. You are using the values 0 to 100 to represent 0 to infinity, which is not really accurate. If you look at the actual values, which is +1% total health vs physical damage per point of armor, its linear. Entirely linear, and based off of the amount of health you have.\n\n1 point of armor is +1% effective health vs physical damage. 2 points of armor is +2% effective health vs physical damage. This continues on even past 1000, where 1000 points of armor is +1000% effective health vs physical damage. \n\nThat is called linear scaling. \n\n__________\n\nAlso, if you have 0 armor, +%10 reduction means you are taking .9 of the damage you would take (100 x .9=90 damage). If you are at 50% reduction, +10% reduction is actually .8 of the damage you would have taken prior (100 x .5=50 damage-> 100 x .6 is 40 damage, which is 80% of the value of 50). Yeah, each % of reduction is twice as hard to get, but it also has twice the effect. After 66% reduction, it is then three times as hard to get, but 3 times as effective. 75%+ is 4 times as hard to get, but 4 times as effective. At 80%+, a 1% increase in damage reduction is 5 times as hard to get, but each 1% increase is 5x as effective. \n\nEach 100 armor brings you up one 'tier', in that regard. 0=0% reduction (100% EHP). 100=50% reduction (200% EHP). 200=66% reduction (300% EHP). 300=75% reduction (400% EHP). 400=80% reduction (500% EHP). \n\nThis is the damage reduction that your EHP represents. Notice how you get the exact same increase in EHP per point of armor, even though it appears that your damage reduction is increasing by less. \n\nIt is, in fact, linear. Not diminishing. \n\n_________\n\nWhat you're thinking of is % increase of your total EHP. Normally you have 100% effective health as a base. 10 armor makes that 110% effective health vs physical damage. To increase this by another 10%, you would have to purchase 11 points of armor, leaving you at 121% EHP. To increase by another 10%, you'd need 12 more points of armor, so on and so forth. \n\nIf you have 5 apples and buy another 5 (+100%), that doesn't mean you have to then buy 10 (+100%) to get the same value. Each apple is still worth just as much as the next.

highest dps in the game. in the late game carries blow up instantly but also deal insane damage to make up for their squish builds.\n\ntanks by contrast do not, but also do not deal enough damage to blow up a carry by themselves. so if you aren't getting to that adc or no one else is he is going to kill everyone. thats how it should be.\n\ntanks can tank for most of the game and can still tank late, but an adc will shred a tank late game. that is pretty much their job. mages still struggle with tanks late game relative to how squishy they are. unless you are a high dps mage like azir or cassio. \n\nand in the mid game tanks are oppressive because they deal decent  damage while being tanky as fuck and having cc.","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2016-09-29T23:00:31.591+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im pretty sure riot lessened instagibs expecially for adcs and mages. tanks cant tank cause they farm slower and less reliably considering that they buy survivability that doesnt make farming easier while adcs get damage from their first back that makes missing cs super hard meaning adcs build faster than tanks also adcs get kills funneled into them more gold to build faster tanks sustain nerfed cause warmogs allowed tanks to have too safe a laneing phase but being able to stand out of your enemies range of damage all game unless you didnt ward your flanks isnt too safe game play. but adcs only do damage right thats what makes them dangerous isnt not like they have extra mobility that makes you have to catch them multiple times or cc where they say fuk nope when ever you engage them (-.-) how about being easy too kill you got 1 combo on them so they are down to 30% of their hp they are totally out of the fight now right not like they gonna auto attack 3 times and be back to full hp again","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Phoenix Kotori
