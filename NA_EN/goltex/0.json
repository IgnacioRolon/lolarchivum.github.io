So i am a player that has played this game from season 1. For that long long time i have always had this one problem. Bug Splat... When i play solo, premade, normals, ranked, ARAM, 3v3, even dominion it just finds a way to Bug Splat. Soooo after some time i went to the Help page where i found ways to stop this. I tried them all but nothing helped. The only thing it did was delay it until the next patch. So coming in to Season 6 you can see how fed up i am with this whole thing. I have been banned for leaving games (not by my choice when it goes in to a crash loop) and forced to wait 5-30 min. for something i didn't even do. I have done everything on my side, sent around 10 error reports in hope of riot patching this. And now sometimes it even fails to connect to the server, telling me to check my internet connection. So at the moment on typing this there is still no fix, and i'm here writing this instead of playing my game that i cant join due to another bug splat chain. I really want someone to fix this, its been too long and i'm slowly leaving the game due to this fact. Please find a way to fix this thank you.\r\nHere are my specs:\r\nIntel Pentium E6500 Dual-core @ 2.9Ghz\r\n4GB ram DDR2\r\nNvidia GT 240 1gb Vram GDDR3\r\nWindows 7 Ultimate\r\nI run the game on High-Medium with around 90-120 fps, 60-70 in team fight.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-06T18:24:15.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may be having a combination of issues here that may need some troubleshooting individually.  As a first step, is the connecting to server error a RADS error?  Your PC might be blocking some specific games files, which could be resulting in this bug splat.
