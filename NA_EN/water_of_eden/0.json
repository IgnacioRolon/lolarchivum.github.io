I had been having a lot of success with both of them. I noticed that after a certain point, the more I played my mains the sloppier my playing got. I've started playing a lot of different junglers and expanding my champion pool. Now I've added Xin, Pantheon, and Elise to my champion pool. \n\nThe most interesting part of this was that once I went back to Wukong and Lee my performance on them was much better than it had been before. It makes sense because if you practice different champions you improve your mechanics. \n\nWhat do you think? Do you have any experiences like this? What do you do when you start playing sloppy on a champion?","replies":[{"poster":"PaladinNeph","date":"2014-04-07T13:52:25.792+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ARAM. enough said.","replies":[{"poster":"Water of Eden","date":"2014-04-07T18:16:19.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or Urf.

I don't curse and yell at me team just, myself I get angry when I mess up a Yas or Riv play..\n\nSo when that happens like in your case, yes I play something different as well. Usually for me its playing Aatrox top because hes one of my faves as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XxTSwiftxX","date":"2014-04-06T09:28:40.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I main jungle and top and starting playing support for filling  and have never lost as taric until my 16th game and starting winning and losing over and over.

In particular, whenever I have taken a small break from League due to travel or the release of another game, I come back and my mechanics tend to be slightly better.\n\nIn League though I've had the best experience mastering champions. It gives me more time to focus on strategy and map awareness.\n\nWhen I start playing sloppy I tend to just take a break.  But that's easier said than done. Especially when I'm losing I always want to end the night with a win. ","replies":[]}]}
