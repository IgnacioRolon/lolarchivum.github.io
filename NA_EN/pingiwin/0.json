Outstanding ISP may even have bad routes because their priority is not to provide you lag free gaming but outstanding download speed and browsing speed. \n\nYou should use a vpn to fix your routes... get [Kill Ping](http://www.killping.com). This should fix your high ping problems.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-11-04T23:58:00.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Pingiwin,\n\nI understand your frustration since I was having the same issues at my place.
