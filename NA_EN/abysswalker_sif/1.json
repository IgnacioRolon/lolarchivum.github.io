It just fucks up after champ select ends and the game tries to launch.\n\nTried googling it. Just a bunch of people saying to download the runtime. Downloaded and ran the runtime. Install location bar was blank. Had no idea what folder to put it in. \nhttp://i.imgur.com/bEwPb5u.png[/img]\n\nAlso tried googling where DirectX should be installed, to which people were just saying \"it should be automatically installed.\" Decided to post here. This was my first game of a 5 minute low-prio, and now I'm probably going to go up to 10 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Morgageddon","date":"2016-04-11T20:16:43.689+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyo,\n\nYou need to re-install a base version of DirectX and associated runtimes. That picture you have is asking where you want the DirectX source files to be installed to be unpacked to. Pick a folder somewhere you remember, and is ideally empty. Then click OK. When it's done, navigate to that folder and run the file 'DXSETUP' in it, that'll auto-install and update DirectX.\n\nThen restart your computer once it's finished. That should fix it. Should it not, you'll want to install the DirectX runtimes from a different source, such as a required installation from a different video game (since we don't have DirectX as part of the main installation from the core files).","replies":[{"poster":"Master of Bacon","date":"2016-04-11T21:36:43.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can confirm.
