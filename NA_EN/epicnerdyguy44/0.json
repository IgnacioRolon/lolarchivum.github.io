Most feel that if there was a visual bar showing how close you were, players would be too focused on the grind and not just enjoying the game as normal!\n\nWith that being said, I feel like most of the purpose behind these checkpoints is just that. A way for you to see how far you've progressed towards the next rank.","replies":[{"poster":"EPICNERDYGUY44","date":"2018-01-12T01:43:24.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i get what your saying, but its always nice to see your progress.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"antech","date":"2018-01-11T23:45:18.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'd like to know how much it takes for the rito monkeys to fix honor 0","replies":[{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2018-01-12T00:25:30.594+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chat behavior like this is often what keeps people down. You can only blame yourself, not Rito. But in regards to the original post, I too would be curious to see an actual honor bar implemented. It would be useful to tell people where they currently stand, and when their honor progress is locked due to their behavior, and to be able to see when it's been reduced.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EPICNERDYGUY44","date":"2018-01-11T23:51:42.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol, I Know Right.","replies":[]}]}]}
