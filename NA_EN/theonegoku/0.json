I actually ended up losing the match, no big deal, and the next one.  I blamed my skills and tried to work back up.  So after a few afks, I was back down to 13 points and decided to call it a day.  So I get on this morning and figure its a new day, lets do this.  In the first game our mid couldnt move due to lag.  So we lost quickly and I was down to 0.  Shake it off, start the second game, and we have no bot lane.  Jinx and lulu are afk and we get destroyed.  They are finally able to connect right towards the end after our inhib is destroyed and said the server wouldnt let them on.  So to my suprise, I get demoted...thats just great, excitement to dissappoint so quickly (Now I know how all the Rito employees' wives feel).  So with my head down I figure hell, its a lower rank, I should be able to bounce back against worse players, so I queue up...cant type in chat...dont know if that came with the demotion or what...but im last pick and watching what our team comp is..and oh wow...three junglers...I guess im in ELO hell now...\r\n\r\nTL;DR can we get some sort of human element to review this kind of stuff instead of \"oh he lost, he must suck, lets keep demoting him\"?\r\n\r\n/rant","replies":[{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2015-01-19T19:05:49.585+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except that DC's are a serious and continuous problem.","replies":[{"poster":"CheckMyDoubles","date":"2015-01-19T19:15:08.824+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"And are now punished harsher than ever with the LeaverBuster system.

First and foremost, the likelyhood of someone going through all the trouble to get another account to level 30 (without botting their way there) just to perform this is quite low.  Coupled with the fact that them going afk often would still flag them for leaverbuster and would still eventually get them banned, that I personally don't find this to be a big issue.\n\nPeer pressuring a guy to afk (ex: take one for the team man I don't wanna lose mah lp!)\n\nHow to solve this?  You don't.  The odds of someone actually \"taking one for the team\" with a bunch of random strangers that they have never met is not very likely (yes, their are exceptions).  Thus the amount of people ACTUALLY doing this would be quite small, thus making its impact insignificant (it might actually become significant at very high elo where there are significantly less players per rank and as such you could simply have it disabled for challenger/master tier, however I feel this would be unnecessary until it proves to actually be a problem)","replies":[]},{"poster":"What Is Smite","date":"2015-01-20T01:10:11.636+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Incorrect actually, the chances of having a troll in one of your games is 9/10 (9/10 ia used because you don't know if those players are planning to troll the game) for every slot that is available in the game which you do not take up meaning the 11% chance is upped to about 40% to have a troll in one game of League, then if you add in the variable of human emotions then the chance of having a troll in any game of league jumps from 40% to anywhere between 60-90% because people tend to let their emotions roam free on the internet without having any decency towards other human beings","replies":[{"poster":"Cerbearus","date":"2015-01-20T03:12:37.129+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"No idea what you are talking about.

Multiply the odds of getting a troll for each vacant slot by itself and you will get the actual percentage that a troll may take one of the vacant slot in the game, then add ontop of that the randomness of the team balancer mechanic in any match-making mode and then you find that each team has equal odds of getting the \"troll\" player on their team","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaFifer","date":"2015-01-20T08:05:21.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You speak a whole lot of stuff about things that don't matter.
