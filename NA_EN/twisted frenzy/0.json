I was not flaming, I was not being negative. If this is automation it is pathetic. I used to get more frustrated in chat and was chat restricted appropriately but that was a long time ago. If what I have said recently is worthy of a ban then the game should just be shut down....I was not being toxic at all.\r\n\r\nAnd, riot has made it so there is no contesting? If its too much work to review some cases then they need to improve the intelligence of the system. That or they do this so people will create new accounts and spend more money which is just a scam. I was working my way up the ranked ladder and at this point, I  have been stripped of my motivation to care. I&#039;m a paying member and feel that the treatment is terrible, especially when so many real trolls and toxic people continue and affect 1/2 the games you play.\r\n\r\nBasically riot is saying don&#039;t use chat at all and when people refuse to play with the team you can&#039;t even suggest (or beg) they join in a postiive way...apparently that&#039;s against the summoners code. What a joke.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2017-01-12T23:47:30.516+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":2,"body":"This normally would have only resulted in a chat restriction, but you've had 2 chat restrictions in the month before this, so it was escalated to a ban.\n\nIn the future, you should just mute people and report them after the game.\n\nThreatening people with reports, telling them to enjoy their ban, and constantly arguing instead of playing are all things the community does not find acceptable.

Good game.  They do whatever they want and telling people to stop flaming or play safer is good enough for a restriction or a ban? Yeah makes sense. Motivation completely lost. There are plenty of other things to do with my time. In all 3 of those games, I was only trying to bring it back from a sure loss. Part of the problem? They were already over due to trolling.","replies":[{"poster":"OnlyYouCanHearMe","date":"2017-01-13T01:17:44.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's certainly frustrating when you have people trolling and making repeated bad decisions on your team, but constantly pointing their flaws out to them isn't going to make them play any better.  And you seem to spend a lot of time either threatening to report your team, or telling other people on your team to report them.  It's entirely admirable that you try and keep your team from dissolving into nothing but flaming, but I think you might've gotten a little overzealous with the reporting.  Keep in mind, it only takes one report to flag a game for review.  You do not need the other 3 members of your team to report with you.  Your report is sufficient.  So there is never a need to type the words in chat \"I'm reporting you.\" When you do, it becomes nothing but a threat, and a form of harassment. \n\nAnd the reason these logs warranted a 2 week ban was because you were on the third tier of punishment.  There are four tiers:\n\n1. 10 game chat restriction\n2. 25 game chat restriction\n3. 14 day temporary suspension\n4. permanent suspension\n\nWhile cases of extreme toxicity can be escalated and skip tiers, most punishments will follow this, and move from one level to the next.  Directly after receiving a punishment, a player remains in a sort of \"negative\" standing in the system, until they have shown good behavior and played enough games to be considered back in good standing.  But there is no set time frame for how long that takes.  It's longer for the more severe punishments, but it can be a fairly wide range of weeks-months depending on how many games the player plays, and how they behave in them. \n\nIf you decide to play League again after your temporary suspension is finished, please, for your own sake, be cautious.  It can take much longer than you think to drop back down to the next lower punishment tier, and you have seen how logs that might ordinarily seem rather mild can be considered toxic by Riot and other players.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pantheon Forever","date":"2017-01-12T22:41:37.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, \"asking people to stop trolling\" is synonymous with accusing people of trolling, which constitutes harassment. Even if they are trolling (which is also breaking the rules), harassing them about it is breaking a different rule. Meanwhile chat is easier to monitor than game play so the players harassing the trolls will get punished more often than the trolls. This trolling technique is commonly referred to as \"baiting\".\n\nhttp://31.media.tumblr.com/cd47586487a8e721254bd2530e1e3992/tumblr_nd9bmidYZS1rp0vkjo1_500.gif\n\nThe system that punished you is working as intended while the system detecting trolls is newer and still needs work. If you want to be proactive start a new thread and start a list of things the non chat related system should look for, including but not limited to {{champion:34}}  wall blocking allies,  {{champion:74}}  AFK farming gromp over a wall, and {{champion:223}}  eating low allies and ghosting and flashing to spit them under enemy turret.","replies":[]},{"poster":"venomous frost","date":"2017-01-12T22:33:24.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only humans can be intelligent\n\nA computer just follows pre programmed code\n\nthus you are not wrong","replies":[{"poster":"Pantheon Forever","date":"2017-01-12T22:51:55.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well artificial intelligence is at least theoretically possible.
