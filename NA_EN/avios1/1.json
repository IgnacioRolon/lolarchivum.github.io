Yes. \nits not a case of what everyone wants (because not everyone wants the same thing, its a case of how harmful to the queue health dividing the player base so much will be.\n\nDo I believe that they can play without solo queue? no, because I know enough about how harmful dividing the player pool can be and even more so with a restrictive matching system.\n\nin the end I believe that dividing the queues will be harmful to the queues, and not allowing duo in solo would be even more harmful, regardless of what the player base believes they prefer\n\nmy doom saying is something riot trying to prevent by giving motivation for solo players to flex queue by giving rewards on both, but I honestly don't think that will be enough.\n\nthis is my nonsense belief \n\nDear lord I'm rambling, I stopped making sense to myself, good night o/","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"UnboundCreator","date":"2016-11-21T17:44:02.187+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Limmie,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=H24xkaLo,comment-id=0000000100010000000000000000,timestamp=2016-11-21T17:40:59.500+0000)\n>\n> Which means nothing really has changed.
