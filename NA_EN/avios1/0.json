More often then not, I see people using their flash where a single potion could fix the damage they would have received anyway...\n\nCalling flash a .3% increase in speed is a pretty disingenuous summation of flash. In lane it allows you to be safe further from your turret. Flash can be used to escape or engage. Late game a single good engage can mean win the game and you can do things with flash that you just cant without it. \n\nIt sounds like you think people fail flash more often than succeed and I don't think there's anyway that's true. I think you don't remember when people use it properly because its normal. Its nothing special, someone just used their get out of jail free card. But it stands out when people fail because its so easy and its funny that they wasted such an easy to use and important cooldown.\n\nI think the issue with a lot of the other summer spells is that most of them are only useful for parts of the game. You mentioned clarity. There are probably some times in lane where you could make better use of clarity than flash but even on mana hungry champions you out level the need for mana.","replies":[{"poster":"Avios1","date":"2015-07-08T13:07:42.795+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For flash, the \"oh crap I messed up\" button, its easy to gank even when they have flash if they push just a bit ahead of their turret. just bust flash once and your good to go for a good 5 minutes, its simple. its better just to ward and pay attention to the map instead of taking flash and not warding IMO.","replies":[{"poster":"Bunny Bells","date":"2015-07-08T13:21:10.502+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Avios1,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=eO3PLtiP,comment-id=000800000000,timestamp=2015-07-08T13:07:42.795+0000)\n>\n> For flash, the \"oh crap I messed up\" button, its easy to gank even when they have flash if they push just a bit ahead of their turret. just bust flash once and your good to go for a good 5 minutes, its simple. its better just to ward and pay attention to the map instead of taking flash and not warding IMO.\n\nI think this is my favorite. \n\n\"You died because you didn't have flash.\"\nWell what would happen if I had taken flash, but it was on cd?

Oh yeah, how am I harassing the guy? Did I attack the guy? Did I disrespect his beliefs in any way, shape, or form? I never said anything oppressive to him or you at ALL. Trolling is someone willingly being a detriment to their team, one way or another.\n\nEven though it has its uses, I prefer to choose what summoner spells I want to use, and I believe that calling someone a troll (Look at first paragraph) for not taking flash just makes the accuser more foolish. Within the third paragraph, you have defined Trolling, which leads back to the first paragraph, which explains that I am trolling for not taking flash, while you claim you are not attacking me in the third one.\n\nI believe that just because I willingly choose not to take flash, I am just as important taking {{summoner:7}}/{{summoner:3}}/{{summoner:12}} and {{summoner:14}}, and that I may be able to support my team just as well if not better than with a 5 minute-cooldown button that says \"oh crap I made a mistake\", and I will just learn to deal with it and recover from it and make adjustments to my playstyle, allowing me to become a better player overall by not having to rely on a free 5 minute jump.\n\n~Avi","replies":[{"poster":"viken","date":"2015-07-08T04:22:15.660+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not here to explain to you why flash is superior to other spells, nor am I here to repeatedly explain how you're being extremely ignorant by not listening to the tons of people that are trying to teach you.

Because I'm used to play without flash, so i have a pretty good positionning and I'm decent when outnumbered. You will walk to my lane, wait a bit in that bush to find the good opening burn your flash and ult and run back to your jungle. You'll lose about 400 gold of farm make 300 gold from my death and since I run {{summoner:12}} I'll be back in my lane before I can lose a cs.\n\nYou'll feel good because you are 1/0/0 but i'll know you are 100 gold, a ult behind and that you revealed your position to my team and i'm gonna be happy with it.\n\nEdit : To those who noticed that when i compared flash at .3% ms to clarity at 66% dmg I might have been a bit off : Yes I know I was exaggerating.

How useful is that to you?  If another summoner spell is more useful, then take that instead.\n\nIn direct combat, other summoner spells (Exhaust, Ignite, Barrier, Heal) are generally more powerful than Flash, so by taking Flash you are giving up duelling power for the ability to escape ganks or to make flashy plays.\nAgain, the choice should depend on what you want to do in the game.\n\nJust remember that if you don't take Flash or Ghost as a solo laner, the enemy jungler is going to see that and try to camp you.  You need to be prepared for that, and should really only do it if you know you can survive that extra jungler attention.\n\nSome examples of who can easily get away without taking Flash:\n\n - Extremely tanky champions can often be better served with Ghost (it covers more distance overall, but leaves them in attack range for longer - a tank usually won't die instantly, so the extra distance helps them.)\n - Mobile champions can afford to take another spell in some cases, depending on the circumstances - but just because they can doesn't mean that Flash isn't often still the better choice.  For example, a Katarina can get away with Teleport/Ignite quite easily, but Flash is far more useful for her to get kills (and she needs kills to snowball) since it allows her a long-ranged Flash-Shunpo engage.\n - Junglers can pretty much take whatever they want, since they are the ones who are least likely to need to Flash away from a gank.  Again, pick whatever is the most effective.","replies":[]},{"poster":"s LessThanThree","date":"2015-07-08T14:07:11.793+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"The fact of the matter is, there is barely even a handful of champions in the game that are viable without flash. Examples being, Shaco, Hecarim, Renekton, and Shyvana. I can't really think of any other champions, so if you think of one, let me know.\n\nBecause flash is necessary for almost every champion to be viable as it is by far the most overpowered summoner spell with a near infinite amount of possible utility, you really need it if you want to perform well. \n\nTake a look at your match history - you literally never pick flash. Mordekaiser 4-12 without flash. And I thought Morde was easy to gank to begin with. TF with no Flash OR Ghost. No mobility on an immobile, easy to counter mage. Karthus with no flash. The list goes on.\n\nI would love having you on the enemy team because it would basically be a free win for me. Anytime my flash is up (or even just any time in general) when you're out of position there's no way for you to escape, so I would just make a play on you and kill you, and you'd feed (like you do often ranging from 1-7 to 4-12 ish scores).\n\nI mean, you can either try to be all special and different playing \"your own way\" and complain when people point out your mistakes...

I can be completely viable with a Teemo w/o flash or Karthus support even, and still be able to provide my team what I need to\n\n- I prefer using exhaust/ignite due to being able to reduce their bursty mage or ADC's DPS. I don't feel as if Flash is every too neccecary to have, and I don't believe that its the best choice to save your teammate.\n\n-Either way, if I were the jungler, I would bust your flash to begin with, and proceed to camp your lane until you learn better. Most of my deaths are also mid-late game, where I am not exactly the feeding type early on.\n\n-Even on an Immobile mage like Karthus or TF, I still control some sort of CC to peel myself with, and I can get away quite easily with a bit of effort.\n\n-Flash is Overestimated. People either don't gank because they see flash is still up, or they don't gank because they are pushed to the turret. I consider flash as more of a nuisance than anything. Sure, it can help you get a kill or escape easily, But that is 5 MINUTES. within a game, five minutes could mean the difference between a win or a loss, and a short-ranged blink doesn't help me a whole lot.\n\n-I don't follow what other people do. If you wanted someone who takes flash/ghost on someone like TF or Kog Maw, then you came to the wrong thread. Utility vs efficiency, and I prefer to use Efficiency. \n\n- As much as you may think, match history and scoreboards don't matter at all.
