Jhin right now does not fit in any type of comp. If he is intended to be an adc he sucks, he cant do what adcs in teamfight do which is to attack whats in front of u and do consistant damage because he have just 4 bullets which he fires at a .90 attack speed and the have to reload for 2 secs. Well if that is not his strength i was thinking maybe he is intended to be a ad caster poky champ with long range? But his abilities are not intended for that his q does not have the best damage unless u kill something with it first(useless in team fights) his traps take too long to detonate, his w have a really good range but the dmg is really low, and his ultimate its pretty good for staying behind of ur teamates and do dmg from distance but.. think about it for u to fire all 4 shots of ur ult takes about 5 or 6 secs , the damage of each bullet is about 300 late game at best(exept the last one if someone is low)  so ur damage as an ad caster is really bad too. So what is he intended to be?  \r\n\r\n\r\nOne way they can make him really good and at the level of other adcs is: keep his abilities but take out the dmg reduction of his critical auto attacks.. so even if u only have 4 bullets each one of those is a threat to the opposing team. Also that makes sense, for example: lets take a reggular adc like caithlyn or mf, late game they are critical hitting about 800 to 900 dmg with each auto with an average of 1.6 attacks speed, 6 seconds of them hitting a target  way more dmg that 4 jhin bullets that take 6 secs to fire.. but if he have more ad than them thanks to his passive plus doing that ad damage critical its about the same ...\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me know what u guys think i wanna hear your opinion :)","replies":[{"poster":"Anraton","date":"2016-03-07T18:32:20.663+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fanatic won 4x

hit 2 bullets and a q for example. or 1 bullet, w, and q. dont know if the activation of his trap also triggers a thunderlords stack, or only upon dealing damage.","replies":[{"poster":"EcchiOtakuTM","date":"2016-03-08T23:04:33.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Either way since he outscales thunderlords with DFT and now has single targets

to do (burst his opponent down), it adds quite some significant damage to his already significant burst. i mean if he crits for 1500 damage, that extra 400 damage from thunderlords might cause him to 1 shot his opponent with an auto attack after trap + w.\n\ni think the question between both masteries is if you want more poke with dft, or more burst with thunderlords.","replies":[{"poster":"EcchiOtakuTM","date":"2016-03-09T19:14:37.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's still undesirable to go TLD on jhin he outscales it and easily applies it with Q/W/ulti with just 1 hit not to mention it makes traps actually do damage.\n\nFor jhin to do pick plays he doesn't get off 3 attacks either, and DFT+Ulti makes it do a lot more damage since the DFT hp drain isn't something to laugh at, even picks up kills with 1 shot so I don't have to waste another bullet most of the time thus free CDR.\n\nAnd since DFT has no CD he can apply it several times over with traps+Q on the entire enemy team vs TLD which does less damage and only affects 1 target if the enemy isn't bunched up and since it's 3 hits you have to ulti 3 times to proc it so you can't get the CDR as often not to mention if blocked you won't proc TLD at all.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Muted

Over time his abilities will net more damage and also gives him a magic damage passive to help against the fact people will be building armor against him unless your team comp already has shit tons of AP where MR will be highly bought for protection against burst, you'd may be better with thunder lords or even Blood lust for better sustain. Thunder lords isn't bad either but not as high in damage output as Death Dire Touch. I feel Death Fire Touch will net more damage. Q is halved damage via DFT. W and R is single target so full damage, E is halved damage as well.\n\nIf Jhin has 800 bonus ad late as you said may be possible, it would be 480 magic damage each W shot and R shot with that halved on Q and E 240 damage.\n\nI'm not a mathematician and I'm bad at it but if that is correct. That is a pretty hefty sum. The only issue is each stack of DFT will only refresh but not stack. so holding off each R shot could maximize the damage output on to 1 champion for each shot.\n\ninstead of dealing 420 magic damage every 15 seconds (level 18) late game you could deal 480 magic damage each shot x4 for his R plus 1 for his W netting 2,400 magic damage in total plus a possible Q with 240 damage on every hit target or a unlikely E with 240. Assuming he had 800 ad late game in which if he had that much ad the game should have ended long ago.\n\nHis W and R is where it shines and his Q. The E is highly unlikely to work but it would be nice if it does.\n\n\nIm not 100% clear how DFT works either with items but it may proc with {{item:3094}} or {{item:3087}}  but I can be wrong. I don't know so but it could. {{item:3087}}  could add extra damage to each target via DFT. Not sure if it would be halved or not.\n\n\nI hate using Death Fire touch though with AP users because most AP users are burst or require using all your skills quickly as possible so making use of it would be hard unless your able to constantly burn your targets in lane {{champion:63}} or a very serious fed {{champion:45}}. Thunder lord is just more effective early game and mid for that. Karthus makes me want to take DFT with extra R power and being in the thick of battle pressing Q and E toggle, it could net some damage but Karthus may need that extra power for early game skirmishing via Thunder lords due to DFT requiring a lot of AP to be effective because we can't have nice things thanks to Brand.\n\nDFT with Nidalee constant Spear chucking would make use of DFT more than thunder lords but her cougar form may work better thunder lords. Jhin isn't able to spam his abilities to fast so he can make use of DFT much more than thunderlords. I have also at least been able to kill opponents with a W or single R shot canceling the rest with them dying a few seconds later due to DFT where thunder lords may have already been down or used before hand where I could keep DFT up almost constantly with Jhin.\n\nJhin is a champion that could very well kill his enemy ADC with his R only, late game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JÃ¶tunheimr","date":"2016-03-07T18:41:56.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jhin is by far the best ADC when it comes to lane phase. It all depends on what support you have playing against him. \n\nI am a Jhin main, I am (just ended) a 11 win streak with Jhin. I played with a Sona support that went AP items. The amount of damage we both put out was insane, we could be in the worst of situations, even getting ganked, and still come out on top with almost all our health left. He has high crit damage with that last bullet once you get IE first (which I go first) not to mention, he is good with rooting people in place with his W when champions are trying to get away or setting up for a surprise attack. (his W only roots once you or a teammate has attacked the enemy) His ult is good against squishy teams and for when the other team is trying to dissengage. \n\nPlaying with a sona support provides so much damage in my lane that we can basicly Global the enemy adc with just our combo. \n\nSona Q > Jhin W > Jhin Q > Sona R > Jhin R > (then sona chases after spamming Q while they try and get away\n\nIt mostly results in a kill. \n\nI have had NO problem facing any of the other adc, it all depends on their support champion. Usually I have trouble playing against Blitzcrank, Naut, Leona. Naut is not much of a threat, its just hes really tanky and doesnt take much damage when all-ining, but his engage is really brutal and fucks me. Thresh isn't much of a problem for the fact that he he cant hook me through minions and he takes a lot of damage from me and Sona when he tries to come in for a hook.\n\nPlaying against squishy supports is easy because my sona can just Q poke them for days and I can just engage them when they are low enough and seal in a kill.","replies":[{"poster":"VegetarianZomby","date":"2016-03-07T19:32:23.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"U have a point.. can you tell me your first 3 items u get with him","replies":[{"poster":"JÃ¶tunheimr","date":"2016-03-07T19:52:00.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Infinity edge > Static Shiv > Blood Thirster","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"mogonk","date":"2016-03-07T19:06:21.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Give him a dash that cleanses slows.\n\nOr a blink.\n\nDone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"La Barbotte","date":"2016-03-07T19:01:44.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"because hes a utility adc, and thats OP in competitive, he can get pick from accross the world as well as executes, he got free vision and blows up squishies","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeloricVI","date":"2016-03-07T18:40:53.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every game I've had with Jhin, he snowballs with his early game advantage and bot becomes so un-salvageable by about 15 minutes, my team just dies inside and gives up.
