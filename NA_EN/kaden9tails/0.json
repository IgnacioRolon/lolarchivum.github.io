I am literally done with this.\r\nFirst of all, lately i've spent a lot of money on this game recently, and after these events occurred, it makes me think that maybe this game isn't as reliable as I thought it was.\r\n\r\nI decided I wanted to play Lissandra, which was a new Champ I got. When I got to the loading screen with all the cards, nothing was happening. Everything wasn't connected, so I restarted my computer multiple times. I decided to reinstall, but then an error kept on popping up when I was downloading the thing. I would have to restart the installer and it would pop back up at 33%. I uninstalled everything\r\nEVERYTHING.\r\nAnd now when I try to open up the game. The little LoL picture pops up, but nothing happens.\r\n\r\nPlease respond, I do love this game. But fix it.  {{champion:127}} {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-24T23:05:34.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of the areas where you're running into issues (loading screen, 33% during patching, launching) are indications that this is caused by an issue with your PC reaching our servers properly.
