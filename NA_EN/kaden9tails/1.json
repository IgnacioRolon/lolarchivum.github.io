How do you find time to play between all that chatting?\n\nSecond, you get super vindictive when anyone says anything at all to you in chat. It's not your job to punish them for being toxic. (Same thing applies to the part where you threatened to AFK).\n\nAfter people pissed you off, you repeatedly antagonized them for the rest of the game.\n\nAll of this qualifies 100% as being toxic. You need to chill out. If you can't handle it when your teammates say stupid shit to you then you need to _/mute all_ at the start of every match or even move your chat window off the screen (while in game press ENTER and then use your mouse to grab the window and drag it as far over the edge of the screen as you can).\n\n---\n\nSome safe rules of thumb include:\n\n1. If you're going to say something, avoid offensive language, this includes hate speech, gross implications, and cuss words. Even if it's not hate speech it can upset other players, so better safe than sorry.\n\n2. Don't make implications or insults towards other players. Simple, if you piss someone off by insulting them, they are more likely to want to report you after the game.\n\nAnd here are some more specialized tips:\n\n1. If you absolutely need to rage, do it through another avenue that your fellow players cannot see. It's not wrong to get these feelings out, and you shouldn't repress them. You just need to find ways to do so without negatively impacting others. Two recommendations are either yell at your screen, or alt tab for a few seconds to open up a notepad and type up a storm. Another one is to yell into a pillow.\n\n2. Don't address individual players directly when talking about their bad actions.\n - If they are trolls or toxic, they will only react even worse.\n - If they are doing badly and tilted, they may feel singled out and get defensive.\n - If a player is struggling or making mistakes, it is easier to talk in terms of \"we\" the team. For example, \"We need to ward around baron like, 30 seconds before it spawns next time so that we can approach it without the enemy catching us.\" Instead of, \"You shouldn't have tried to make a baron play without vision.\"\nOr another example, \"It will be safer to wait under turret for the lane to push instead of going out to try and farm at half HP.\"\n\n3. It's really important for team morale to make teammates feel like you respect and support them. If they feel like you have their back, they will have yours as well. They will listen to your calls for plays to make, and they will be a lot less likely to argue with you or report you after the game.\nYou can accomplish this a few ways:\n - By complimenting them for good plays, even if they are not the ones responsible for that play going well. This will motivate them to do even better the next time because they know that they will be recognized and appreciated for doing well. For example, \"Great job Top and Jg.\" After a gank occurs top-lane that results in killing or forcing the enemy laner to burn significant cooldowns or recall leaving their turret undefended.\n - By consoling them when a play goes badly. This will make them feel like you respect them as people even if they are playing poorly. It will let them know that you aren't just watching their every move waiting to criticize mistakes, and it will minimize how much tilt they experience from their play going badly. For example, \"Hey man, I'm sorry that didn't go well. It's ok though. Better luck next time, right?\" After a failed gank that wastes significant cooldowns or gets the jungler or laner killed.\n\n4. There's other things you can do outside of game as well, like taking a 5 minute break to get up and walk around after a frustrating game. Getting your blood flowing and shaking your limbs out will help your mind to reset from that experience so that you don't carry it with you into the next game and make mistakes merely because you are frustrated.\n\n5. Additionally, it is important to get sufficient rest, nutrition and hydration before playing. If you have the nutrients you need to keep your brain functioning well, it will be much more resilient to frustration and you will be less likely to tilt after a negative experience.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Winters Dawn","date":"2017-08-11T21:43:26.403+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly you should be perms banned for the amount of time you spend typing.
