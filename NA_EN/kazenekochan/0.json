Or a buff in other awkward itemizing situations. {{item:3092}}{{item:3098}}{{item:3303}},{{item:2139}},{{item:3151}},{{item:3285}},{{item:3116}}\nSo, very clunky and bad solution for a small problem.

Trundle's a tanky initiator, Janna's an utility disengage. I fail to see how something that works for one has anything to do with the other, considering how vastly different their kits are.\n\nThat's like saying {{champion:80}}'s should make a global sound alert when he starts his ulti because it allows him to travel about the same distance as {{champion:421}}/{{champion:14}}.","replies":[{"poster":"Baron of Bread","date":"2015-05-03T05:43:36.631+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does create a giant circle where he is going.

Rek can only go to particular points on the map, while Sion can go anywhere he has a reasonably straight line towards.  Rek's has a channel, Sion just starts running.  Rek's is only mobility, Sion's hits like a truck and provides strong cc.  Rek's is global range, while Sion's ult is very restricted in where and how far it can go.\n\nI was mostly just pointing out that very different abilities have similar mechanics tacked on to show that the Pantheon argument is irrelevant.  All three of those ults have something that says \"Here I come\", just in different ways.  The Sion/Rek'Sai case just shows a really good example of _different abilities_ with the _exact same mechanic_ tacked on.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KazeNekochan","date":"2015-05-03T03:19:25.381+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AdQEUQQA,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-05-02T23:03:22.965+0000)\n>\n> Are there particular circumstances in which you're seeing Janna's ult knock enemies away but not apply assists?
