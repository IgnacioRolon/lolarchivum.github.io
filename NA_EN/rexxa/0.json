Sona is in the bottom 1/3 of pickrates in Yolo Queue and the only reason she isn't the absolute lowest is because of her massive popularity amongst fanboys that's only rivaled by her massive tits.  Which are non-coincidentally directly related.\n\nThe typical Sona player has extensively more experience playing her than the average support player has playing most other supports.  Contrarily the average player has obscenely low experience playing AGAINST Sona and is unaware of the fact that she actually has the lowest damage output of the entire support class.  Worse even, most sheeple suffer from the absurd misconception of her doing damage that's being misleadingly propagandized by the abuse of artificial numbers, namely Spellblade and Echo.\n\nSona's (artificial)\"winrate\" is a result of Sona mains abusing the masses' inexperience, misinformation and bronze mentality.  The last being proven by the fact her winrate from Bronze to Diamond can fall up to 10% or more on any given day.\n\nSona is **THE** weakest support in the game.
