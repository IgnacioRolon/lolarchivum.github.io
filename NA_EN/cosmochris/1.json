This never happened until this past week or 2 and I ended up getting a low priority que punishment twice because of this issue. There was another case where Time Warner Cable shut off their services in my area for a couple of hours because \"they were running some tests\" while i was in a game. Idk if I'm just really unlucky, but was just wondering if I can do something about this (getting punished for AFK/Leaving game when I didn't).","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-16T01:39:58.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow that's pretty sucky to have your ISP shut off your internet while you're in a match >_<'\n\nThere's not a whole lot we can do about those penalties here on the boards, but we can try and help figure out why those loading screens are freezing on you to stop you from getting penalties in the future.\n\nSometimes if your network gets interrupted while on the loading screen, it can cause some really weird loading errors which cause the game to crash.
