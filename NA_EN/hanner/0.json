After this patch I'm having ping constantly of about 106.  I checked many different speed test sites and they all said my ping was fine.  I reinstalled league and the problem is still persisting.  It is playable, but frustrating, as my internet is fine, but for some reason my ping is way above what it should normally be.  I'm not really sure what to do I tried everything I could think of if anyone can help that would be great.  Thanks!\n\nEdit: I tried: ipconfig /flushdns, release, renew none of them helped.  I also reset my router multiple times that did not help either.  I am fairly sure it is not my internet as I have been playing other games with my normal ping and when I did a speed test it also was normal\n\nEdit:   I have been reading through the replies and it seems that people with frontier are getting routed to seattle.  I also have Frontier as my ISP and I assume many other people who play league do too.  Hopefully riot will fix this soon","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-06T21:50:05.567+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"***EDIT:***  From our investigation, it appears that the issue is on Frontier's end.
