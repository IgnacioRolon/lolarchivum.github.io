The 2017 Lunar Revel details are available [here](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/skins/lunar-revel-2017#/intro).  The event ended on February 2nd.  Sorry for the confusion.  :(  Lunar Revel Caitlyn is a legacy skin, so if it's not available now it can still come back in the future.  It can also be found through mystery gifts or hextech crafting.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
