They did an analysis of where the jungler is at all times for each team.  Any time the jungler was, I don't know the actual number, 1800 units within a player it counted towards the JP%.  If you had a team that liked to camp for top lane the JP% for the top laner would be really high.\n\nIn the context of supports it's talking about the synergy between support/jungle roaming together.  Those numbers are saying that mithy roams more with their jungler than aphro does.","replies":[{"poster":"Tiza","date":"2016-09-29T22:57:48.704+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is correct!","replies":[{"poster":"Very Competitive","date":"2016-09-29T23:58:27.144+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just spent a very long time trying to look up what it was and this is the only place I have even seen reference to it\nCan you please make it more available so the statistics don't just seem random.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2016-09-29T22:54:49.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've never heard it.
