Really not fair. Really really disappointed! \n\nhttp://imgur.com/MdFJ0Zi\n\n> Off topic: i know i m low elo but i only started playing ranked at the end of last season! I got into silver 5 and in my team there are former gold players with low mmr that keep feeding cause they think they have to carry! so the only games i win are the games i go 20-2-x and obviously that doesn't happen every game! so i keep losing cause 70% of the time my team either wins then throws or just feeds to a point i can't recover! unlucky matchmaking ?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-22T01:45:00.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even though your connection is in tip top shape outside of League, there's still a chance that your network lost its link with our game servers if you were disconnected from the match.

Packet loss happens when some of the data your network is sending gets lost before it reaches our servers. Even with packet loss problems, your ping can look like it's stable.
