You have a crapload of options that suit different champs/playstyles/team comps/matchups with armor items (ie, rand if you need to reduce crit, frzn heart if the enemy team has a lot of aa reliant/on hit effect champs, thornmail if you see an oppressive marksman, etc).

That kind of passive should NOT be tied to one of only 2 tank MR items. That passive should be on Warmog's as this is the consummate health/health regen item, and has been since it's inception.

My experience as an avid magic damage-dealer player is that ANY champion with 2 of your 3 mentioned items ({{item:3111}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3102}}) is much MUCH harder to take down. You have to expend your precious cooldowns, and even then you are not rewarded for a kill with a full rotation MOST of the time. It's much harder to take down a magic tank. (at least with my experience)\n\nThis gives you more room to expand your versatility. As I've already mentioned, {{item:3083}} is a great choice as it offers lots of HP with scales with your resistances. Titanic, while not a \"tank\" item per se, gives you the option to split push a little better and not CONSTANTLY having to be chained with the team in order to be useful, allowing you to make better use your of your {{summoner:12}} late game. {{item:3030}} is an underappreciated item, as a tank and wanting to be \"full raid boss\", having this awesome AoE slow is tremendous in keeping the enemy within your grasp. The same argument for Titanic Hydra can also be argued for Sterak's, except it's more teamfight oriented where that extra shield is HUGE. {{item:3800}} is great for later on in the game, you've already become a tremendous pain to take down, and so while you MAY have been taken down via a myriad of spells, your friends are swiftly approaching with a awesome speed boost ready to take advantage of the situation.\n\nThough I do agree with you, it would be nice to have more options for MR. I'd love to have a version of the old Force of Nature back.\n\nGood discussion","replies":[]},{"poster":"JamesTheMage17","date":"2016-08-17T14:15:05.987+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's simple.

You need more armor in game than MR due to most AP champs not using AP on everysingle auto attack.\n\nI mostly play tanks and get annoyed when I look at the options available but then I remember the flip side of that and don't feel so bad for most mages.  Obviously there are a few outliers like spell crit Ryze (or just old ryze wuth mega ap apam), some fast casters, old Azir, and a few others with super low cd's or %hp magic dmg (which is more a problem with too many champs having %hp dmg than it is items).\n\nEdit: btw does Randuins only affect ad crits or is it also spell crits?
