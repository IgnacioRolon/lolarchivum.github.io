The weapon is something he carries, but not something magical or important enough to him to merit lines in his text. I suspect it's a normal over-sized halberd, and that the siphoning power it has is something stemming more from Nasus than from any quality of the weapon itself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-05-16T13:57:36.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well Nasus is based off of the Egyptian god Anubis.
