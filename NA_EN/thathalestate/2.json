Like the new Tribunal. Riot is conning piece of shit telling us to follow summoner's code but ignoring it altogether when they HAVE TO review some case. And even if they find all accusations false, they claim punishment was correct. Riot is perfect example of Norhtern Korea.","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2017-02-20T04:31:44.991+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Are you okay?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Darkmind1212","date":"2017-02-20T16:12:33.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AeroWaffle,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=BjGlTYbw,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-02-20T03:30:28.632+0000)\n>\n> Riot says they&#x27;re looking to add something so that people who dodge can state why they dodged.\n> \n> On a side note;\n> : u racist fg\n> \n> Hypocrisy in two lines.\n\nThough lets face it this has been a known issue for far too long. And While riot did create a good game they seem to be the slowest when it comes to applying anything in terms of new ideas. Though this could be do to their internal teams size or but from what I hear interviews of people contracted to work with them from time to time they seem to only know the basics when it comes to curation of well...Anything. Then again it could have just been where they were sent to work. Like I said I am not fully certain.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kaioko","date":"2017-02-20T18:00:21.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually had a queue last week where I refused to trade top lane with the jungler (I never jungle) and the guy kept flaming on and on in the most ridiculous ways I have ever seen. There literally was about 40 lines of chat with various extremely sexual and graphic content to try to insult me. Personally it was almost entertaining what this guy could come up with.\n\nI do agree with you that reporting in champion select should be implemented I'm just not sure how complicated it would be to do so or if it would be abused.","replies":[]}]}
