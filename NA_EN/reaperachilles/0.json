I got it because my laptop stopped running league. I got this and It was running league so smooth until the last patch like two days ago. now I get into a game and like 4 seconds in to the game, it freezes. so I have to shut off my computer and reconnect. my drivers are up to date and so is my computer. I uninstalled and I thought it had worked because I got 30 minutes into a game and then it all froze. I'm not sure why this is happening, this doesn't happen with anything else on my computer, can someone help me?","replies":[{"poster":"Fou4ever","date":"2016-10-05T13:16:59.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same problem here.

Disabling that may solve this!  If you still have issues, I recommend using our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide in case there are still any updated drivers or game file issues causing this.
