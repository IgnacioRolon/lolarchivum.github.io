Whenever She throws the dagger in the air to catch it , the dagger spazzez out and wiggles back and fourth really quickly before falling. I would appreciate if the animation was fixed. Please and thank you. {{champion:55}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-11-18T17:26:27.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi! \n\nThanks for reporting this!
