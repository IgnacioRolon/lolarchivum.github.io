It's much better to buy Ashe with IP and to get garen for free from following Riot on Twitter, then save the champion essence for a shard for a more expensive champion and use the shards either for a champion reroll or disenchant them for more essence.","replies":[{"poster":"bbb","date":"2016-03-31T23:11:15.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"New players get baited into unlocking a 450 ip champ with essence,  xd","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Son Golin","date":"2016-03-31T22:45:28.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hello Ekko Fox,\n\nNo and yes respectively. After the Hextech Crafting system was launched, new players now get a New Player Chest instead of the 400 RP award. More context can be found in Riot Socrates' post here:\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/ZGErnvY4-hextech-crafting-new-player-chests-to-replace-400-rp\n\nThere may have been a delay in the New Player Chest being awarded, but it should be in your inventory by now. If it's still missing, please contact my colleagues through the Support Site and we'll happily look into it further: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
