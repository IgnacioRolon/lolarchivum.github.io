As a champion the point of the rework was to make a playable, but very forgiving champion that any new player could pick up and not bomb with.\n\nHe also looks really strong at the lower elo's because he is a strong duelist and not as easily punished.  Things like kiting out and cc'ing targets (see also Nasus, Yi, and Riven) don't become more common until higher up.\n\nPeople play him a lot because he's fun and at least relatively easy to pick up.  His overall strength though isn't any higher than a lot of other junglers.   Take for example Volibear was at the top of the charts this patch, and while the new buffs did a lot for him he still isn't that strong higher up.

The less wards you have, the less opportunities to make those \"sick montage plays\" or whatever that make lee a high skill cap champion.\n\nAnd it's not just about balance. Sure, it's great to have a champion that isn't too weak or too strong, but that doesn't matter when that champion isn't fun at all to play. Lee sin right now just feels so much worse now without trackers. Plays you could've easily made if you were good at him earlier you now can't do because you have to wait another minute on your ward, which pushes him to a more farm heavy playstyle as oppose to invading/ganking. I know a lot of people here on the boards will bitch about ganking junglers all day and just want to turn the role into a second vegetable support in which you just play tanks and farm until you become unkillable.\n\nAlso fiora is not a problem, just going to put that out there now.","replies":[{"poster":"Leaf on Bush","date":"2018-03-03T16:22:14.738+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> The problem is that his skill cap was decreased exponentially with the removal of more wards.\n\nI think what you wanted to say (or should have said) is that it has increased because he now has to chose between spamming wards and keeping them for ward jumping.","replies":[{"poster":"WrÆth","date":"2018-03-03T16:36:23.018+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except now you don't need to think about pathing because there is only one option now, which is farming because you can't risk invading because of limited amount of wards and cant really gank without wards.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Karfuss","date":"2018-03-04T00:55:35.302+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd consider him balanced. His winrate among experienced Lee Sin players is still reasonable.\n\nHe was the only jungler that was given an item to enable his abuse of hopping. If I recall ward hopping was an accident in design that Riot decided to roll with, and since Katarina lost it, I see no reason why Lee Sin should have it. Let alone an item specifically for him (unless you were pro tier Jungle) encouraging it. I'm happy with him being on Jax's level and can use it conditionally with a trinket.\n\nNo Jungle meta whilst Lee Sin was meta, was ever fun. I don't want to ever return to a point where, unless you're playing Shaco/Elise/Shyvana/Udyr, your entire jungle is ransacked and you're constantly camped. That was toxic, and junglers shouldn't ever become meta on the basis they can 1v1 a Lee Sin.\n\nMuch to the dismay of his mains, he is a champion like Olaf... That should never be allowed to be meta. He runs rampant and dictates it whenever he is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Humble Aatrox","date":"2018-03-03T23:57:41.552+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lee sin is  a stupid champion who deserves to be gutted in my opinion","replies":[]},{"poster":"Abibyama","date":"2018-03-03T14:10:46.771+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Here we go again","replies":[]},{"poster":"PhantomPrankster","date":"2018-03-03T15:46:23.873+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"lee sin is trash, those buffs won't help.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mimr","date":"2018-03-03T16:15:31.230+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Wardhopping shouldn't even be in the game, so that's no reason why Lee should be buffed.
