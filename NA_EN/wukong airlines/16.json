Make black cleaver's passive only apply if your champions is melee and give it a slower rate of stacking... 1 for 1, not thie 2 for melee nonsense. \n\nTADA!  ADC's can still get LW for armor pen, but they're no longer abusing all the assassin items.  They'll likely go back to crit builds like they were always supposed to, and the melee assassins and bruisers will have the new \"lethality\" items to do exactly what they want to do.... get an early power spike and snowball.  Assassins will build armor pen to try for early kills, but they'll fall off once people have built a ton of armor, unless they also build BC... which is sub-optimal for someone who doesn't stay in the fight for very long.  So assassins will be powerful and terrifying early game and against squishies, but falter against tanks... LIKE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO.  Tanks have more have trouble with tanky-bruisers who build cleaver and some damage, then tanky enough to stay in the fight for a while.. but a solid tank can still hold one of those at bay.  ADC's will be playing for their late-game crit builds and once they finally get them, they will rule the roost once again.\n\nBut that's fine!  It lends to a natural order to things.  Not everyone gets to be awesome all the time.  Assassins = strong early.  Tanky/bruisers = strong mid game.  ADC's = strong late game.  Nothing wrong with this.  \n\nAs for mages, they're harder to balance because of how wildly diverse they are... so I think the best bet there IS individual champion changes.  I'd say mages might do best with something akin to a \"sliding scaling\" thing if they want to diversify them though.  I don't think it would take much, really.  Lower the early AP scaling of mages not meant to be powerhouses initially and raise the late-game scaling of mages meant to maintain their power all the way through a match.  Most mages as is fall pretty comfortably into being strong in the mid-game as it is.  Mages meant to be lane bullies or ones who fall off over a long game should have decent base damage.  Mages meant to build into their power and become late-game teamfight-winning GODS should lose some base damage (lookin' at you, Brand).\n\nAnd this is just shit I came up with in like.... ten minutes.  I'm sure it's full of holes and could be tweaked to make better... but it's more than Riot has done in months!

I DO think assassins should be early-game beasts that snowball if they get a lead.  I also think they should fall off a freakin' cliff if they DON'T get ahead.  Seems fair to me.  They give up any hope of a strong late game in return for a potent early one.

Looking for something to disagree with? No, but why would anyone post a comment if they didn't find something to comment about, which is usually a disagreement?\n\nLowering its value would put it back to exactly old Armor pen. Lethality values are higher than Flat pen to compensate for the scaling and making them stronger later on. It would be the exact same as before if you didn't further it lower. Which might be what you wanted but the wording seems to say otherwise.\n\nOne kill should not mean \"lane's over\". And extreme snowball or being worthless is the definition of Feat or Famine which is what Riot has been trying to heavily lessen. Not to mention \"extreme early game\" means that their laner is either also an Assassin or has to sit at their tower giving up huge amounts of pressure and and almost requires jungler assistance, basically meaning picking an Assassin frees up so much jungle pressure for your jg to gank other lanes. If the Assassin doesn't get camped then he gets free roams since the enemy laner basically isn't allowed to leave tower.","replies":[{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2017-03-21T07:14:38.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"See... you say this but the game is snowbally now more than ever.\n\nPrior seasons... if a laner got ahead they could personally snowball.  Your fed top might carry the game... or he might lose to their fed mid.  Individual skill mattered a lot more.  Fed assassins stomped but name me a single freaking meta where the guy getting ahead early can't stomp.  TANKS can stomp when they're ahead.  Remember the era of tank Ekko and tank Fizz?  Yeah... that was much better than all these assassins, wasn't it?\n\nThis season.  The entire freaking TEAM snowballs.  Towers fall like mad and the enemy is battering down the base at 18 minutes.  There is a reason that korean surrenders games REALLY early.  Because they're decided really early.  Nothing has changed, except that the game feels a ton less fun and a ton more frustrating and toxic because your personal efforts seem to matter a lot less now.\n\nThere is NOTHING wrong with high risk, high reward champions.  Just like there is nothing wrong with late game hyper carries.  One is powerful early and SHOULD fall off if he doesn't snowball, and one is weak early but becomes a god lategame.  This is good and it's called variety.  By trying to make the meta as it is, they've just sorta made a meta where basically everyone is the same.  When EVERY champ worth picking has a dash, an AA reset, a shield and % damage... what makes them different?  When everyone is expected to be strong at every stage of the game but NOT able to snowball hard.... they all become generic and middle or the road.  When every item has attack and defense stats, everyone kinda becomes a basic bitch half-tanky bruiser.  It's all the same.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"N3mO06","date":"2017-03-17T16:44:28.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WiegrafOfValor,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5cJ4rBV2,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2017-03-17T14:17:55.645+0000)\n>\n> #The main problem are ADCs\n> \n> Everything about them is wrong, their design is wrong, their playstyle is wrong, the way the game is shaped around them is wrong. \n> \n> Think about it, a class design to build only damage, suck up everyone&#x27;s EXP and GOLD, be feed like a baby with kills and objectives so it can become the easiest  target to kill with the most potential of winning a teamfight. \n> \n> ______________________________________________________\n> \n> That only leads to 2 outcomes:\n> \n> 1.

Did I like every role?  Eh, not really.  I hate playing adc.  But having to play one every so often made me better at the game overall.

This leads to them making stupid mistakes, failing to realize important things that they would have known if they... say... played bot lane once in a while and knew when that lane was likely to go for dragon.  And lastly, it makes it so much easier to rage and shit on lanes or roles that they never play.  They feel less like a part of the team and more as an anchor you have no affect on that is dragging you down.  When I got stuck playing adc, I rarely excelled.  This also made me a LOT less likely to give other bot lanes shit for doing poorly.  Why?  Because I'd freaking been there!  I would try to help them out.  I would realize more what the real problems were down there rather than just saying \"freakin' teammates are feeding again.  worthless assholes\".

Most \"balance\" decisions are made around competitive play the problem with this is that a pro player will pick up another strong champ pick that wasn't nerfed. Sometimes champs just have a bad design and overloaded power budget (anything Certainlyt made/rito reworks), sometimes items/masteries(keystones/%damage) are too strong. The BIGGEST issue is that it takes Riot months after preseason to pull it's head out of it's butt and do something most of it overloaded nerfs and changes that should've been addressed. That's what's happening to Jihn and Varus is that they are getting stacked nerfs (items, masteries, champ balance) to the point where they will be weak like Kalista.

By dividing it so thoroughly for instance, you could give supports stronger stats on items without other classes (like mages) taking advantage of them, or you could give Juggernauts some good AD/HP items without ADCs using them as well.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
