Most likely Cleaver. Or maybe IE.\n\nMAYBE it is they don't want Ornn and only Ornn to open the door to a lethality first purchase item ADC again.

But I'm getting the feeling they won't necessarily be must rushes.\n\nIt is not a good reason in my opinion to directly exclude a class of weapons from his wares. Ornn's teammates can only choose 1 special upgrade and it costs 1000g for the non support stuff. That's plenty of control...\n\nReally I think the lack of an AD caster item is just a symptom of Riot's apathy toward the low elo terrors.\n\nMy other guess is that none of these 1000g upgrades are gonna pop out until 6 items by that point it makes less sense to support a flat lethality item.
