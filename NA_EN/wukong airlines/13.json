I never played dota but I&#039;ve read you lose gold upon death as well.\r\nSo why not bring more competition to the game through using skill and by only 1 uniquely designed champion?\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t have the proper champ design. I&#039;m only suggesting it because I enjoy playing as a Thief in almost every game (offline/online).\r\n\r\nBut I&#039;d think  a Thief would be similar to the following suggestion:-\r\n\r\nPassive: gains more MS per level ,gold/ per few seconds.\r\nOr\r\nThrough Thief&#039;s power of speech, all items costs are reduced a % amount of gold (scales with level).\r\n\r\nQ: next auto attack will deal bonus damage and apply poison ,poison reduces target&#039;s damage (if enemy is stabbed from behind he&#039;ll be silenced).\r\n\r\nW: becomes invisible for few seconds boosting his MS , gains more MS the more he gets further away from his enemy.\r\n\r\nE: passive: you gain more AD based on your gold in pocket\r\n\r\nActive: shares portion of his gold with his allies.\r\n\r\nR(heist)(can only be activated when invisible) : steal a % of your enemy&#039;s gold (scales with MS, the faster you run towards your enemy while invisible, the more gold you&#039;ll be able to steal)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis may sound broken to most of you, why? Because it&#039;s entirely a new concept that requires different playstyle with/against.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s all matter of numbers. There&#039;s an unlimited room for creativity when designing a Thief. So, suggestions everyone?","replies":[{"poster":"CobaltTheMadMage","date":"2017-05-12T22:06:48.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is basically Teemo except more evil because you can get a gold lead with relatively little effort and have the unprecedented ability to deny your opponent progress in itemization by actively stealing gold from them.

The gold steal would either be strong enough to significantly impact the enemy's itemization that it could set them back unfairly or be weak enough to be little more than a nuisance and not be worth having as more than a petty middle finger to the enemy. To say nothing about the potential boost to the champ's income; a free percentile discount at shops would potentially be a bigger income boost than any income item or TF's passive (I don't include Draven's since his relies directly on his player's interactions and skill).\n\n\nIF you want to have a \"thief\" concept and have it involve gold income, I would suggest starting by taking a look at existing methods of boosting income for a champion and/or try to find a way to put a skill floor on it and just leave out the \"making the other person actively lose gold\" bit entirely.
