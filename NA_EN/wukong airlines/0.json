While you wait for those to be blown your team is fighting 4v5. Then when you do get that chance, your team is likely barely alive and struggling to make it out with disengage and then here you are going balls to wall with absolutely no back up to help you make it out alive. Assassins no longer assassinate, they are there for just the sheer amount of dmg they can dish. They stay with the pack, they don't veer off for a flank. Tanks are the ones I see doing that.

Cho'Gath is extremely immobile and his 2 main abilities are on high cast times.\nI don't recall crit items ever being more expensive.\nRyze is all about positioning and avoiding his damage, you'll deplete his mana bar in 2 rotations in lane.\nAnd Jarvan? Jarvan is like Riven - Squishy enough to be bursted when behind and obnoxious when ahead. At least Jarvan doesn't become practically invulnerable with no chance to catch him.","replies":[{"poster":"AIIan","date":"2018-01-04T07:15:04.284+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":7,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LightTrack,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=oBUc7I5Y,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2018-01-04T07:03:31.838+0000)\n>\n> Cho&#x27;Gath is extremely immobile and his 2 main abilities are on high cast times.\n\n{{item:3009}} {{item:3800}} {{item:3742}} \nI wouldn't call a screen-sized monster running at you at 900+ms \"immobile\".","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2018-01-04T11:57:58.183+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"I wouldn't call those items viable against every matchup as you make it sound to be.","replies":[{"poster":"Lit Corn","date":"2018-01-04T14:09:32.367+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"maybe celerity and dead men plate are situational , but righteous glory gives you all the gap closing you need anyway , and tbh you'll pretty much build it on 100 % of your games as cho .

Even in lagless enviornments where Ryze's combos can chain with perfect timing, his strongest selling points in competitive play are his wave control, ult, and cc his team can follow up on, not his damage and not his shield. Which is why his most recent buff has been multiplying the AP ratio by three on his W, because empowering his output in one-on-one engagements isn't going to impact his use in competive play in the slightest. All the while he's sitting under 40% winrate at everything but LCS level of play because the only things he contributes are a coordination ult and a coordination cc.\n\n On the other side of the coin, the second highest winrate mid is {{champion:55}} , {{champion:28}}  is taking the top spot in the jungle with {{champion:35}}  not far behind, and {{champion:84}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:245}} are doing well to very well between top and mid.
