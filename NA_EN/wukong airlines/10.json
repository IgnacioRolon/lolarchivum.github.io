And his whole kit need to be changed (more or less).\n\nWukong stacks AD, an AS steroid makes AD more efficient since every auto scales on AD.  Even if he's not building AS his builds are either straight AD or Bruiser.  Compared to other fighters he fills a carry role similar to Fiora, he's just not building things like Ravenous usually.  And there's more examples like Jax, Yi, Pantheon, Poppy, Irelia, ect in the same role and they've got their own balanced version of the enemy only targeted dash.  Vi even handles it well in ultimate form.  It doesn't matter if they're the same functionally, every similar ability has a different function.  \n\nThings like Gragas E, Sej Q, Kha E and Kayn Q will all be used to wallhop, but are you going to tell me I should never compare similar abilities just because they have a different bonus effect?  Targeted dashes are balancable, Wukong's problem isn't his E existing.  Honestly he'd probably lose power if you changed his E since making it some dash you can aim at the ground means that if it isn't wall restricted he's more mobile than he was ever allowed to be and it'd cut from his power budget.  If it is wall restricted, even if its a new weakness he has a tool he can use to escape in lane and things like his HP/Damage would have to be tuned around this new power.  He already has W as a flexible offense/defense tool, if you want more mobility there's other parts of his kit.\n\nAnd I'm not against changing E, I'm saying that \"ITS TARGETED\" is a bad argument since Riot can balance these kinds of abilities.  They remove them from kits that are actually toxic or from kits that are overly dependant on them.  Wukong is pretty balanced right now in WR but isn't pickable in a lot of games because he's limited in ways similar to Garen/Darius, he needs to be in your face to be strong.  His E accomplishes getting in there to be on their face pretty well, so I doubt thats the issue his kit has.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ChaoticPinecone","date":"2017-07-01T23:32:31.740+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who actually thinks Wukong should be a melee hypercarry?
