There are a few annoying ones that happen somewhat regularly, like your Q dealing 0 damage, a couple bugs with his W healing, and tons of bugs with the drag AI that make him hard to control.\n\nYes, Mordekaiser is bad right now. He's somewhat playable in the bot lane(ew) but, the real problem is that he needs to be remade from scratch and given a modern champ kit as a top/mid laner. Right now he's kind of a mess of ideas that doesn't really fit in current LoL.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2018-07-11T15:25:40.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Out of curiosity, have you bothered to test even a handful of this list?

I must reiterate, however, my disappointment that we do not have an up to date list with appropriate evidence that can be worked with.
