This kind of advantage directly translates to your ability to snowball the lane, and ultimately the game. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfmm40Ow-T8\n\nIn this video, Jeremy GamingCurios demonstrates a last hitting practice regimen [originally developed by Diamond ADC Elyndar](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/204xyb/learn_to_cs_like_a_challenger_with_elyndar_a/) and [turned into an infographic by bruzabrocka](http://imgur.com/orWUCKH). As he notes in the video, this regimen helped him increase his last hitting accuracy from 60% to 80% -- an improvement that results in an extra 21 cs (~420 gold) at the 10 minute mark of a match.\n\nJeremy is a Platinum support main on NA, and is the creator of the [Jeremy \"Gaming Curios\" - Guides and Top 10&#039;s channel on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/GamingCurios).\n\nHere are some of the highlights:\n\n* [[1:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfmm40Ow-T8&feature=youtu.be&t=85) Drill #1: General last hitting\n* [[1:52]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfmm40Ow-T8&feature=youtu.be&t=113) Drill #2: Movement and map awareness\n* [[2:21]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfmm40Ow-T8&feature=youtu.be&t=141) Drill #3: Wave management\n* [[3:01]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfmm40Ow-T8&feature=youtu.be&t=181) Drill #4: Simulating pressure\n* [[3:39]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfmm40Ow-T8&feature=youtu.be&t=219) Drill #5: Challenge mode\n* [[4:25]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfmm40Ow-T8&feature=youtu.be&t=265) Results and observations\n\n\nHave you ever attempted a training regimen to level up your League mechanics?

One thing that I see so many adc's miss out on is those yummy minions under tower because of how time-intensive it is. \n\nBAsically: \nMelee: 2 hits on a melee minion from a tower will allow most ad champs to kill it. For you ap champs, try to get an auto off within the first shot of the tower, so you have time for your animation to start up again after the second shot.\n\nCaster: For just about everyone, auto a caster before the tower hits it, and it'll be low enough for you to enjoy that sweet, sweet 17g payout.\n\nCannon: For a Caddy minion, usually around 3-5 shots'll do it, it depends on the amount of hp remaining when they reach your turret. I'd personally recommend expending a little mana for these guys, as 35g is pretty worth.\n\nAlso keep in mind: With the exception of another minion type entering first, or an enemy champion is actively attacking a friendly champion, turrets have a specific type of minion they focus first, before moving to the rest. They'll take Cannons first, then Melees, then Casters. \n\nHave fun with your minion genocide!{{item:1039}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drukyul","date":"2015-07-03T20:23:13.393+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":7,"body":"Drill 1: play DotA 2 for a week\n\ndone","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sky RUSHER","date":"2015-07-03T19:15:45.510+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"Back when i had problem with CSing I practiced it in vs bots while learning new champ at the same time.

There are two things, however, that I would like to add when doing those drills.\n\n1. Each champion has its own animation time for auto-attacking. The differences are subtle, but it is enough to affect last hitting as you play one champion to the next. Lucian, for example, has a pretty quick animation, from key input to when damage is registered. Tristana's animation is slightly longer, so when I started using her, I had to start over from scratch and get her timing down. Nautilus' animation is much slower, so you got to input the command sooner than later (though on the flip side, his passive adds a chunk of bonus damage to the first hit, which compensates for the slower animation and provides a bigger margin of error).\n\n2. Pay attention to the minion attack particles. They help determine exactly when would be the time to attack so you can get that last hit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cha0t1czz","date":"2015-07-04T10:22:33.812+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"that awkward moment when the videos ad is the heroes of the storm trailer","replies":[]}]}
