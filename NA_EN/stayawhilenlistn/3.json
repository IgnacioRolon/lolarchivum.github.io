And is it a reasonable deterrent from dives?\n     c) Do you have TP? \n     d) Do you have a jungler who isn't behind and is willing to help?\n\nIf you have 2a, you're pretty solid in any situation except 1d. Just back off the creeps until he's cleared your creeps, then farm what's left (usually there will be 5 creeps left unless he slow pushes, then 4 are left). This still equates to 8-10 CS/min if you can get it all, a GREAT count. If he's really in your face, do it under tower. Most top laners with AoE damage can clear the wave and tank the creeps, to prevent the wave from bouncing. If you don't have that option, just farm under tower since the damage you take might not be worth the CS. Mid laners with good wave clear can do the same at the cost of 1 potion (which isn't as good of a trade as it used to be, since they cost an extra creep worth of gold now). If they're in your face, just farm under tower. You should probably still be able to manage 8 CS/min if you can clear our the ranged creeps (3 ranged creeps and 1 melee per wave under tower; not optimal, but sufficient to stay in the game).\n\nIf you don't have 2b, things get pretty bad unless you're at 1a. You have to yield a lot of space to the enemy team to safely farm. And you can't push further than the river (meaning just past where your first tower used to be). If you're at 1a, then basically it's a longer (more dangerous) lane for you, but it's 100% safe if you just play a normal laning phase on the safer side. 1a means you should avoid tons of trades and focus more on farming, but you should not be afraid to return damage when they trade on you (just don't all in or keep trading once you've used your CDs; basically, don't let the trade damage be free for them).\n\nWith 2c, you're in a pretty good spot on anything except 1c and 1d. You're in a great position if it's just 1a, and a playable position with 1b (more of a gamble with 1b though). Basically, you can either use teleport to keep up high farm numbers to make up the gold difference, or you can look for a TP play. A TP play with unshared assist money (meaning 2 people to get a kill) equates to a little over a wave's worth of gold, and slightly less experience FOR YOU. But for your ally, it's ~2.5 waves of gold, whatever is left in the lane, and denying whatever is left for your opponent +1 wave. In the event the jungler doesn't take this, it's around -1.5 waves for the enemy, +3 waves for your mid, and ~+0 for you, meaning a net 4.5 waves of gold in favor of your team. From there, you MIGHT be able to move on to an objective. Most likely though, you should make your way immediately back to lane (walk if you TP'ed mid and have most of your HP left 70%+, probably base then walk to top if you TP'ed bot, walk to lane if you're the mid laner). Yes, it didn't help you massively, but it helped your team massively. That 4.5 wave net loss is all in 1 lane. That's 29 CS, which is 550-600 gold. This is just with 1 kill. If you get more, it's even better. Basically, the idea is just survive the lane without losing too much CS/HP, then look for a TP play. Look for when players overcommit (use their dashes/disengages, like Cait Net, Ez jump, Trist jump, etc) or when jungler comes in. Looking for when the jungler shows is the easiest to see and turn. Looking for when players overcommit is harder, and could potentially be too late since they should only do that if they think they can get the kill. Same concept applies if you don't have TP, it's just a bigger risk.\n\n2d is much the same as 2c, except the play is on your own lane. Be sure (or pray) that there is no countergank, and you should be successful in anything other than 1c and 1d. In the case of 1c, you could possibly go 1 for 1, which is a net gain for your team (450g to your team, 300 to the enemy, plus the CS gains and denials in the lane). But it doesn't do much to help you unless you get the kill and CS (and hopefully buff transfer). It could also potentially turn into a 2 for 1 or a 2 for 0. Anyways, avoid chancing it if you can get plays elsewhere.","replies":[{"poster":"Cyfiero","date":"2015-12-11T05:06:53.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if it's 1b or 1c without 2a, 2c, or 2d?","replies":[{"poster":"QQsha","date":"2015-12-11T13:15:13.405+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You literally farm under tower, pick up whatever you can, avoid dying (even if it means going down 50 cs at 10 minutes in the worst case scenarios), spend most of your spells (non-escapes) to try and CS, and ward behind you. Warding behind you means look at where the jungler or mid would come from if they would try to dive you, ward it, and make sure they don't try to 2v1 dive you. If they do, get the hell out and give up the turret. Your objectives here are to 1) pick up all the CS you can without dying, 2) not dying to dives/ganks, and 3) keeping the tower alive as long as possible. If they bounce the wave off your tower and freeze it, roam immediately or ask for a gank if you're not at 1c (you can always ask for ganks until it's 1c or 1d, but don't feel entitled to them; your jungler could potentially do more work for your team as a whole elsewhere on the map). Going up to farming the wave would be suicide, so look to be useful somewhere else. Or hell, even farm your jungle. It sucks, since it takes gold away from your jungler, but you need income. Bottom line, it's a team game. If you're not doing well, make it as easy as possible for your team to carry you to victory. Don't rage at them, don't blame them. Simply think of ways you can be useful and avoid being detrimental. Don't go for plays unless your team is there to back you up. Play the numbers game (4v3 is better than 4v4). Help get out wards (which doesn't really apply to the game anymore because Riot shat on wards).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SP00KY PYKE","date":"2015-12-09T19:46:14.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't play mid often, who do you think would be a good starter mid for me?","replies":[{"poster":"Shunpo Mechanics","date":"2015-12-09T20:03:45.399+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RealDeal003,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=K2xV1WEl,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2015-12-09T19:46:14.033+0000)\n>\n> I don't play mid often, who do you think would be a good starter mid for me?\n\nAnnie","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xrusa","date":"2015-12-09T20:09:24.310+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lux is really strong and really safe","replies":[{"poster":"Bernie4Presdint","date":"2015-12-10T03:38:44.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Persona Royale","date":"2015-12-10T05:07:40.157+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only if you can land lux's q","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ã‡hÃ¥ryzÃ¥rd","date":"2015-12-09T21:14:26.773+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh Annie is probably the easiest with Lux being the second easiest imo.\n\nAhri is another good pick, if you are able to aim her charm and q you can do a lot of damage but her combo uses a good amount of mana early game.\n\nCassiopeia and Orianna are fun too but I feel like you need more focus with them.
