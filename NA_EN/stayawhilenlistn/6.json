They aren't there to stop you from dying. Learn to check your mini maps, keep an eye on the nearby fog of war (you can see some abilities and ward placements even in the fog)\n\n- Your support may have this thing called a \"role\". Got Brand support? Don't act like he has Thresh level peel. Got a Thresh support? Don't act like he can do Brand-level damage.\n\n- You can help ward too. Buy a pink (100g) or green (75g) ward on your 1st or 2nd back, especially if you're blue side (pink that tri, brotha!)\n\nSupports:\n\n- Is your adc not following up your engages? Maybe you need to stop engaging and focusing on zoning the enemy ADC out of farm. Is your ADC going ham on engages and not listening to you to play safer? Maybe you need to work on your peeling ability.\n\n- Is your ADC beyond help? Other lanes would love to have you, even your jungler. Roam, deep ward in the enemy jungle, ward objectives, help your jungle gank.\n\n- Just because you're support doesn't mean you can make no mistakes. Every time anything negative happens to your team, you need to analyze what could've been done better by you, just like any other role.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nAll support and ADC players need to learn to analyze their own actions in solo queue, just like any other role. Supports don't exist to solely serve the ADC, and ADC's don't exist to simply cash in on the huge support plays we all want to make. Just like any solo lane, we all need to learn to analyze our own mistakes and what we could've done better, because at the end of the day that's literally all you can control in solo queue: yourself.\n\nMaster yourself...Master the bot lane\n\n/endrant","replies":[]},{"poster":"EddieServin","date":"2015-09-30T18:27:42.322+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"But a Question for C9 Phylol Any chance y'all got a video for dealing with the bronze trolls and afkers?

(There is mid lane, but when it comes down to basics a lot of people agree the ADCS carry games) So if people play it they play it for a reason. They want to do well, they want to be that person who carries games. They want to be Hi Im Gosu, Piglet, Doublelift, Wildturtle, you get the picture. So when they don't do well they want to blame it on somebody.\n\nAs an ADC main from Season 3, I can say that without a doubt that is what you don't want to do at all.\n\n1. It will keep you from getting better, you are putting the blame on someone else (Most likely the support) and not recognizing your mistakes, and if you never recognize your mistakes you will never become better.\n\n2. YOU ARE FLAMING. WHY DO PEOPLE DO THIS. First whoever you are flaming, you are putting them down, and since they are most likely the support  that is the exact opposite you want to do. THE ROLE IS CALLED SUPPORT, THEY ARE THERE TO SUPPORT YOU AND YOUR TEAM. So if you rage enough at them so they start trolling or even go afk, you probably just lost the laning phase and most likely the game.\n\nI have had moments in which I was basically screaming at my screen because of a bad support, and all I wanted to do is tell them how bad they were. And it wasn't helping that they were blaming me also. That is when I decide to put on music, mute anyone that might be blaming me and try to play the game out. You are fighting fire with fire if you just attack them back.\n\nSo yeah, that is what mainly comes to mind when I think of raging as an ADC. So whenever I am in a game I always try to be kind and congratulate the support and even the team if they are doing well. It will do loads to make them feel better, especially since the support tends not to get a lot or recognition. And even then a lot more times they would respond with something nice. And that makes you feel better which in turn will cause you to probably do better, which in turn will make you more likely to win the game. \n\nMoral of the story, DON'T RAGE, EVEN IF YOU AREN'T AN ADC.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Breadboxx","date":"2015-09-30T20:00:19.443+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"RITO plz. i would love to position correctly if i didnt have Rengars instantly killing me regardless of how i position.","replies":[{"poster":"ρhy ","date":"2015-09-30T21:11:36.992+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey!
