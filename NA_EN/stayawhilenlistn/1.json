It's pretty much a ritual/habit, kinda similar to dribbling a couple times before taking a free throw in basketball. I'd suggest going into a custom or co-op vs AI with the mindful goal of using the tactic every time you recall. Using a custom/coop for this might seem a little silly, but actual games of League just have so much going on that it can be really hard to focus on anything that doesn't involve your opponents. Once this tactic becomes a habit, you'll seriously never have to think about it again.\n\nFor bonus points, try pairing it with some last-hitting practice; could be a great way to warm up and get into the right mindset and rhythm before playing.","replies":[{"poster":"Tann Man","date":"2015-09-07T20:03:23.149+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":8,"body":"Isn't this the exact comment Riot claimed would become a problem if they introduce sandbox mode?

I play one co-op game before going to PVP just like you said.. as a \"Warm - up\" Before running. \n\nGetting things to become habbits is hard, I'm still getting used to using actives but as I keep usng them they become more of a habbit to me. I think league is 25% mechanics.. and 75% mental.  \n\nPart of the main problem is that we all already have our own rythems and habbits. it's sorta hard to break the old habbits to make way for new and better ones. like \n\n- pressing P waiting to get there, shop, then go out <- old habbit to break. \n- walk to edge of circle, shop, then go out..  < - new habbit to achieve. \n\none of my friends on a call said \"Getting to diamond was soo easy\" Kinda made me frustrated.\n\nBut I think people's minds work in different ways..

The undo button helps but an automated system like that seems kind of odd. Also it's FUN to click that B.F. Sword or AP Hat when you have the money. I DO think this sort of automation could be applied to leveling skills though, since that sometimes needs to be done in the heat of the fray (especially at level 3 and 6), and almost every build on every champion has the level order already chosen at champ select.
