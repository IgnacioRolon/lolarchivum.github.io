The support agent was able to give you more context on how we choose players for the PBE servers but to be more clear, we do not simply pick and choose who to accept in PBE. Like what was said in your ticket, players are chosen by an automated system that looks for certain things based on what we're currently testing. It makes those decisions based on things such as \"Hey, we're testing out a champion rework\" and will grab players who actively play the champion who was being reworked.\n\nI hope this gives more context on how players are chosen for the PBE.","replies":[]}]}
