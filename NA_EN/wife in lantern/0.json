When i see this i just think that it's a bad game and every player is bound to get some of those. But this jarvan, man he made me flame so hard that i'm here on the boards to flame more about this game. \r\n\r\nSO THIS JARVAN. Let's start with champ select, right from the beginning of the game i had a bad vibe from this guy as he wasn't a jungle main and refused to communicate both bot and mid asked if he wanted swap ( as they were jungle mains ) He doesn't say anything and locks in jarvan so we assume he knows what he's doing. Fast forward into the game. I burn both kayle's flash and her teleport at level 3 and get a solo kill onto her while jarvan FULL CLEARS HIS JUNGLE (who the fuck does that on jarvan) he then proceeds to run bot and try and dive the support under the turret only to miss his e q and die. Whatever. it's annoying but im not tilted at him, i just think it's unlucky. Knowing that Jarvan is going to be topside now to clear his krugs again, i set up an extremely punishing wave against kayle and make every circumstance right for jarvan to come top, e q under the turret to dive kayle and get out. ( i placed a pink ward in the bush, chunked kayle to below 40% health, was 2 levels above her with level 6 while she was level 4, and had a huge minion wave with at least 15+ minions crashing to her turret while she was sitting there with NO SUMMONER SPELLS. So i ping jarvan and tell him to come top BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT I EXPECT PLAYERS ON MY ELO TO AT LEAST KNOW WHAT TO DO AS A JUNGLER. This man fucking walks his fat ass over to his krugs, clears it and then says \"do you see my health\" (he was at 50% health) and proceeds to walk towards his raptors. I was getting tilted at this point but i keep it to myself and just dive kayle by myself under the turret, i solo kill her and was going to get away but then their jungle shows up and gets a return kill on me. MEANWHILE bot lane has died twice from both the adc and the support and jarvan runs bot lane again and ints 1v2 AGAIN.  (at this point now i'm thoroughly tilted) i continue with the game and get 2 more solo kills before i get a barrage of 4 man ganks toplane along with a rift herald from their jungler. At this point their kayle starts talking shit in all chat and TRIES TO TEACH ME HOW TO PLAY AATROX LOL WHEN I SOLO KILLED HIS ASS 3 TIMES. (mental going boom now) their jungler has secured the rift herald, 3 infernals and 2 turrets in the bot lane the entire time while jarvan was in the jungle. (WHAT IN THE FUCK?) the most funny thing is jarvan starts calling for reports on the bot lane for feeding when he's doing equally bad kda wise but 100x worse macro play and brain cell wise. At this point i'm just thoroughly done with the game, i probably gained a few white hairs playing with this jarvan but its alright i just wanted to leave and he won't even agree to the surrender vote. Below is all the chat logs to what i've said in the game. but the thing that bothers me the most is WHY IS A PLAYER LIKE THIS ALLOWED TO BE IN MY GAME AND RUN AROUND LIKE THIS while im the one getting punished for not being able to handle his lack of brain cells? I'm not even mad at him for feeding, i'm just mad because he's a total r%%%%%. As i'm not a habitually toxic player i only received a chat resstriction but even then i think it's unreasonable that jarvan can get off scotch for while i get hit with this. \r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nWife In Lantern: yo\r\nWife In Lantern: i was baiting\r\nWife In Lantern: top no f btw\r\nWife In Lantern: 0 mobility\r\nWife In Lantern: jarvan?\r\nWife In Lantern: why tf didn you dive top\r\nWife In Lantern: she was half health\r\nWife In Lantern: level 4\r\nWife In Lantern: i could have tanked\r\nWife In Lantern: you just needed to land eq\r\nWife In Lantern: idk why jarvan\r\nWife In Lantern: is not fucking focusing my lane\r\nWife In Lantern: instead hes playing botisde\r\nWife In Lantern: like a fucking r%%%%%\r\nWife In Lantern: literally if i was palying jg for myself\r\nWife In Lantern: this kayle would be 0/7 by now\r\nWife In Lantern: LOL\r\nWife In Lantern: j4 just stfu\r\nWife In Lantern: you are the most boosted player here\r\nWife In Lantern: fucking ff\r\nWife In Lantern: this autofilled piece of shit\r\nWife In Lantern: this j4 doesn't know how to gank, what lanes to focus, how to pressure the map\r\nWife In Lantern: and picks j4 BUT FARMS\r\nWife In Lantern: ??????\r\nWife In Lantern: f\r\nWife In Lantern: we can't win\r\nWife In Lantern: with this plyer\r\nWife In Lantern: on our team\r\nWife In Lantern: i don't\r\nWife In Lantern: you\r\nWife In Lantern: are so lucky\r\nWife In Lantern: i have a vegetable\r\nWife In Lantern: in the jg\r\nWife In Lantern: lol\r\nWife In Lantern: just ff\r\nWife In Lantern: dumpsterfire\r\nWife In Lantern: lose brain cells watching this guys play\r\nWife In Lantern: they have 3 infernals\r\nWife In Lantern: we have 0 objective control\r\nWife In Lantern: no i get a jungler\r\nWife In Lantern: if he came top lane to dive you at level 4 like a normal jungler\r\nWife In Lantern: you'd be 0/10 by no\r\nWife In Lantern: you're actually delusional","replies":[{"poster":"Zardo","date":"2019-09-14T04:22:53.792+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean yeah, people have rough games.

And yet they will treat the game like each lane/role is played in a vaccuum. Top cant invade bot...Jungle and Mid cant invade and pressure top while enemy jungle just shrugs and goes \"not my lane? not my problem\" then Blame lanes for getting repeatedly harrassed and 1v4'ed while the rest of the team acts like \"Well its not affecting MY lane, so good luck\" But suddenly when the fed enemy DOES start hammering bot lane or one shotting the other team, people will dismiss the player by using that resulting kda \"Omg ur 1/14, u intentionaly fed. why u greifing! Report! report! \nThey will not lift a finger to help a teammate who needs it. but instantly blame that player for the resulting kda after being hung out to rot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wife In Lantern","date":"2019-09-14T04:35:39.154+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":8,"body":"It's not a rough game, i went 1/14 because i got dived under turret at level 2 both games while getting camped consistently. while i draw all the pressure top my other lanes are getting focused. this jarvan however, had no other factors affecting his gameplay except for his lack of a brain","replies":[{"poster":"Freaktory","date":"2019-09-14T04:41:54.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"my point exactly :) they wont lift a finger to help you when you are constantly getting camped because its \"not my lane not my problem\"\nthen turn around and use \"Well u went 1/14 so obviously you must be inting.
