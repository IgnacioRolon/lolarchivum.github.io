Adds the stats deathfire had while added movement seed since the champs building this item benefit from movement speed such as {{champion:99}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:127}}   and a more streamlined passive to champs building it without abuse cases. Item I think would do its job pretty well and add a single target option for burst as opposed to ludens which is more oriented for teamfight damage and waveclearing. But yeah thats about it hope you guys have a good day!","replies":[{"poster":"SweedishGunner","date":"2017-05-08T01:48:39.588+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Isn't that just a better Ludens though?","replies":[{"poster":"Khadaver","date":"2017-05-08T01:58:43.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Without the Aoe","replies":[{"poster":"SweedishGunner","date":"2017-05-08T12:02:17.598+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But Ludens is bought for the additional burst it offers.
