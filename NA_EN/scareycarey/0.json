Not just how ESL was apparently silencing anyone criticizing it by deleting their comments (which just makes it seem worse), but the program itself -- if it's a real thing that ends up working -- is going to promote so much inequality in ranked solo queue. So far the launcher apparently allows you to queue with three other friends as noted on the website (which looks like amateur scam-artist trash), and has a Youtube video (which is garbage) highlighting how to make it work. I just think the whole thing looks like a scam at best, or will end up promoting a toxic gaming environment at worst, making a player or two friends have to face off against almost completely synchronized teams in Ranked solo-queue games with their LP on the line. We all know how difficult it can be to communicate and strategize with strangers, so having to face an enemy team consisting almost wholly of friends coordinating with each other will just make that experience so much worse. And something like this normally wouldn't alarm me and I'd just brush it off for what it is, but the company being allowed to promote it over the IEM finals Twitch chat without interference was unsettling, so I thought I should address it. Oh, also, the website promotes Account Boosting so...\n\nThis post is to call that website/launcher out and the people who made it, as well as ESL for helping some sketchy company promote it while silencing everyone else's voice. I hope Riot can read this and give the players some kind of response, because I'd hate to see this launcher become a reality we have to face in League of Legends.\n\n**Edit:** Second post, removed the link. Wasn't thinking. My bad. Still want this to be addressed and get attention.\n**Edit:** I'll assume Riot (and lots of other people) know what Launcher I'm talking about by now and not post its information.","replies":[]}
