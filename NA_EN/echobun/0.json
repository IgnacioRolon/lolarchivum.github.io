I see you're getting a lot of requests to add pink flames but I have a different one.\r\n\r\nI find that Annie's eyes are to harsh in game and was wondering if it was possible to soften the eye make-up on her. especially compared to the splash art where she has such a soft face and almost blonde-white hair her hard black eyes and  white hair in game seem off. is it possible to soften them up and still keep the 750 price? thank you~","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-01-24T00:06:41.824+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm usually around. :3 \n\nI can't guarantee we'll make the change, but I'd be happy to pass the feedback along to the team who's been working on her. ^-^","replies":[{"poster":"Embertine","date":"2015-01-24T01:44:07.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol!\nRiot Katey Khaos, still the most active riot member on the boards!\nGood to know you care about the player community's requests and ideas.\nThanks for being a part of the community! :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GhastlyGhoulMan","date":"2015-01-24T00:34:51.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with this personally.
