Eventually it stopped and I could play properly again, resulting in a win, but I felt it was still important to mention it here. I am pretty certain it was not related to my internet, as I wasn't being disconnected from Discord and there was no indication that I had lost my internet connection.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-18T22:30:15.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can still have normal use of the internet, but problems specifically staying connected to a specific server.  In this case, it sounds like there could have been an issue maintaining comms with our game server.  Just in case, I suggest using the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to tune up your network so it doesn't happen again.
