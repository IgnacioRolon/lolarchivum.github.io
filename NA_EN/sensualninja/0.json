I have been away from league for about three years. I just came back about a month ago. I que up for a normal game as Nid and I do HORRIBLE. Well, like, 2/5. It happens. Anyway, the entire game I&#039;m being flamed by three of my teammates who I assume end up reporting me at the end of the game. I go to log on last night and I have a thirteen day ban because of it. \n\nHow is that fair? Do people even read the chatlogs when they ban? I&#039;ve been taking care of my sick grandmother all by myself and League is my ONLY form of entertainment. But since I was &#039;toxic&#039; and did bad that one game, I got a thirteen day suspension. How is that fair at all? I don&#039;t even think I was that mean. I&#039;m always friendly in chat, but these people we&#039;re harassing me so bad that I suppose I wasn&#039;t 100% kind to them.\n\nI&#039;ve seen chatlogs that get people banned, and I hardly think that this is deserving of a thirteen day suspension. :(\n\nFor your reading pleasure. \n\nGame 1\nSensualNinja: tight\nSensualNinja: cmon i havent played this champ in like 3 years\nSensualNinja: good to know that i cant play this champ\nSensualNinja: something like tht\nSensualNinja: no its okayt ill never play this champ again\nSensualNinja: never again\nSensualNinja: not i\nSensualNinja: fuck off\nSensualNinja: no shit\nSensualNinja: that what normals are for, to try champs\nSensualNinja: and no i know\nSensualNinja: that ill never play this cham again\nSensualNinja: but i cant play her\nSensualNinja: its a normal you shitter\nSensualNinja: reporting sona for flaming\nSensualNinja: thx\nSensualNinja: yeah\nSensualNinja: like wtf\nSensualNinja: i dont see any pinks\nSensualNinja: pls ff\nSensualNinja: jesus yall suck\nSensualNinja: report sona and cas for flaming pls\nSensualNinja: her too\nSensualNinja: pls surrender\nSensualNinja: we cant win\nSensualNinja: this isnt fun\nSensualNinja: i cant play this champ, like i said i havent played her in like 3 years\nSensualNinja: god forbid i do bad\nSensualNinja: please end the game, everyone on this team is the reason why people say league has a toxic community\nSensualNinja: pretty much first time nid so\nSensualNinja: shut up sona\nSensualNinja: you both are trash\n\n\nEDIT: I figured out why I was banned so promptly.
