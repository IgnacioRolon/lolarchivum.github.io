This is the frusturating thing about league its not that they cancel out over a long period of games, its the fact that you need to play a lot of games to get to the elo where you actually deserve to be in.

Out side of that you're right\n\nAs much as I’d like to agree with you, there was a Korean Master Yi OTP last season who kept a 100% win rate on Yi in bronze elo with over 200 games. He intentionally kept himself in bronze by trolling on Tahm Kench so he wouldn’t get promoted. Although he got banned for trolling those game, being able to keep a 100% in any elo proves that you’re statement about “not all games are winnable” is false.","replies":[{"poster":"letsfeedtogether","date":"2019-06-04T23:54:48.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Challenger in bronze 5 witb low mmr playing yi with {{champion:26}}  duo gonna stop working at plat.

There are a handful of Mater Yi and Taric/Lulu duos in masters and grandmasters that are able to withhold a 75% win rate. Sure bad games happen, but overall you are in the elo you deserve to be in, otherwise you would have climbed out by now.","replies":[{"poster":"Heos00","date":"2019-06-05T03:42:52.489+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now get a duo that have the same amount of time to play with you, is skilled enough and has comms.

It is entirely possible to be challenger/GM and carry through plat.  It is another thing entirely to be mid to low diamond in skill and carry in plat.  IT's going to require more games to climb because the skill differential is less.   \n\nFor example, on my one trick, in platinum, I average less than 3 deaths per game, a 5+kda, 7-8 cs a minute, and I out perform Morgana players in all elos in all metrics except for own deaths (I die less than half as much as the average Morgana).   Yet the games are coinflippy for me.  Can I climb to diamond?  Sure, but it's going to take me a long time to do it.  \n\nYou see this a lot in challenger smurfs.  They'll rocket through the ladder and then stall out in high diamond because the skill differential is less.  Tyler1 for example is a top 5 challenger player.  The guy is a beast.  He was hard stuck diamond earlier this season during his bet with Yassuo.  \n\nPeople are complaining because if you're better than people in your elo you should climb faster.  It's frustrating for me, for example, to go 5/0 in lane every game, have good roams, and good macro level play, but lose because people who were last season diamond go 0/15 in my games.
