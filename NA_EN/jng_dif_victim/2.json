The big issue that u face when u get to high elo is boosted players.\nthe thing is boosted players are in all elos but they just get boosted and then they play ARAM and flex and etc... . they dont need to ruin they rank.\n\nbut in diamond+ boosted players needs to play or they decay so u see so much more often boosted players in games because they have to play or they decay and demote.\nand in higher elos master+ u dont see that much boosteds but it get worse because people abuse the small population there and they wintrade and u cant do anything about it and the only thing u can do is just watch wintrader is in ur team or the enemy team.\n\nand also u see Transfer players. like someone got challenger or master in vietnam server or OCE server which has less population and less competetive and they transfer to NA/EU/KR with challenger MMR where in fact they cant compete with them and they just int.\n\nand u cant do anything about any single of these problems. u just get to the point where u cant enjoy the game anymore.\nthe only way for you to actually enjoy the game again is play on smurf and make the game enjoyable for urself in cost of ruining it for 5 more people in low elo.\n\ni just made a smurf account and im leveling it up to destroy low elo so i can enjoy the game because its impossible to enjoy the game on my main account.which is sad and its somthing i never taught will ever do but i kinda have to.\n\ni hope one day RIOT finds out that the first step and first priority of balancing is matchmaking not the champions. all they focus is just on champions. and i hope one day matchmaking get fixed. ban system get fixed. and all players start to enjoy playing the game again.\n\ni know its so selfish to ruin the game for 5 people just to enjoy ur self but league is kinda my life and its my only option and im not proud of it and im sorry for writing all these things.\n\njust wanted to share my feeling with u.\n\nthx for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"AIQ","date":"2019-08-13T20:11:12.951+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"So I'm a bit torn because usually I want to rip these smurfs that post this crap a new one, but you seem a bit more genuine I don't know why. So I'll pull off a bit. \n\nGoing to assume this post exist due to your current loss streak, but that's not important. I'll touch on a few things. \n\n> beside all problems with matchmaking and stuff.\n\nMatchmaking might not be perfect, but it's certainly not going to get better with you ruining the ladder. Stop smurfing everyone should, it's not fair to lower elo players. They should not lose a promo game, because you are upset about your loss streak. Some people are proud of gold, you denying them that with 5 other smurfs is not fair to him. \n\n\n>The big issue that u face when u get to high elo is boosted players.\n\nI'm sure you've never done an actual stat check of this yourself. \n\nI have kept a document of AFKs/Trolls and Intentional feeders for the first 70 games of this season. Numbers were pretty insane with about 62% of my games impacted by these. 13% of that was AFKs, inters where 30% (29.96), and people like gate keepers took up the rest. As far as players jsut playing like there were boosted only ~17% of my games (12) were impacted by someone of considerable lower skill from their laner. However, that could have been simply Autofills doing or a bad game and had nothing to do with being boosted.\n\nThe problem is not nearly enough to be considered a good reason to smurf. \n\n######To add a small amount of credibility to this excel sheet. I sent it to Riot and was happily greeted with 3 Instant feedback reports. So it was somewhat legit. \n\n\n \n> and also u see Transfer players.\n\nI don't know if this is a thing, but I can give you the benefit of the doubt I I've never really heard of it. \n\nFrom Riot \n\n>You'll need to play all-new placement games on your new server. The seeding will be based on your current MMR relative to the MMR of everyone on that server, so you could end up in a different Tier or Division compared to the League you were in on your original server.\n\nSince it's impossible to place higher than P1 you'd probably never run into a transfer Challenger that was not legit. \n\n\n\n> and u cant do anything about any single of these problems. u just get to the point where u cant enjoy the game anymore.\n\nYou can take a break, season 9 is super frustrating for all. NA is in a much worse boat that other region KR re-stabilized since it's more competitive, but NA is in shambles due to the ranked changes. So consider that. There are still masters with less than 40% winrates. \n\n\n> the only way for you to actually enjoy the game again is play on smurf and make the game enjoyable for urself in cost of ruining it for 5 more people in low elo.\n\nNorms/flex exist if it's too tilting for you. There is never a NEED to go ruin low elo. Grab 4 friends and run a glacial comp since you like Tryn so much. Start the game by saying TEAM GLACIAL and laugh. There are more ways to get joy otu of the game then stroking you elo sayin \"look at me smash bronze elo as a Diamond.\" Your rank proves you can do that you don't need to show it. \n\n> i just made a smurf account and im leveling it up to destroy low elo so i can enjoy the game because its impossible to enjoy the game on my main account.which is sad and its somthing i never taught will ever do but i kinda have to.\n\nThis is stupid and atrocious logic. Just stop you don't need it.\n\n> i hope one day RIOT finds out that the first step and first priority of balancing is matchmaking not the champions...\n\nRiot needs to fix it but you are only making it worse\n\n> \n> i know its so selfish to ruin the game for 5 people just to enjoy ur self but league is kinda my life and its my only option and im not proud of it and im sorry for writing all these things.\n\nThen stop doing it and go to norms or flex stop ruining other peoples games to stroke your own ego. Diamond sucks I know been stuck there a long time. I'm very slowly improving, but if it was impossible challengers wouldn't be able to get there.","replies":[{"poster":"mark6028","date":"2019-08-13T20:37:26.979+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ofc transfers are a thing, have always been.\n\nDiamond+ is basically unplayable the first month due to all the TR and eune transfers.\n\nIt has been so bad this season that for a few months you could transfer to TR server for only 1 RP. it was the only server riot did this. \n\nJust because riot doesn't speak openly about it, doesn't mean it's not a thing.\n\n\nSpotting boosted players is easy.

If the guy is a legit challenger and we restart him in Iron we run into the very situation we are trying to prevent smurf-wise. However,  if he does this to boost his rank and end up higher than he originally was then that's a problems too. \n\nSince MMR is hidden I am not sure how it works, but I would \"guess\" that if a challenger in EU is 3000 elo in NA is 2800 elo and a challenger in TR is 2300 elo, the system assumes that since a player is still only 2300 elo he'll be placed in that rank which is likely Diamond 4 for EU  and Diamond 3 for NA . Transferring to them always starts you lower and never higher than P1 so that player \"shouldn't\" (again I don't know) make it to challenger if he can get over that elo. \n\nYeah, from mid 2018 prior I always stated that Riot was be far the best company in fairness of pricing. Money meant less to them then their players. How quickly they changed, I love Shyvana so much, but I don't think even I love her enough to support Eternals. I made post pages long about cool achievements we could try I'm probably one of the most hyped for this system, but the paywall is a... disgusting gesture.

This is from the sheet, but I removed the names with champions.\n\nI added things in ()\n\n> Vlad was in the top lane and was 4/0 all lanes except mid (yasuo) were winning. After vlad choose to attempted a 3v1 and went 1 for 1 he got upset at Yasuo due to Yasuo pinging a ? and told him he did not deserve diamond, and that he'd see to it that he would not win the do or die promo Yasuo announced to our team. Vlad intentionally fed for the remainder of the game. We only made it to the inhibitor with the remainder of lead we had.\n\n> Nasus was in top lane and Shyvana (which is me) was 9/0 along with a fed Varus 6/1. The support (Thresh) was extremely toxic and annoying Nasus who was dying only due to ganks and tower dives not inting.  After a while Nasus made it know that it was Thresh D3 promos and said \"ur upset i'm going to lose you promos now i feed for real\". Nasus refused to cooperate after this point and died questionable deaths for the remainder of the time till 20 minutes when I was outvoted for an FF vote. \n\nThese are examples of what I consider a gatekeeper someone that deliberately trolls only to stop someone in promos. I only had these 2 scenarios. I tried my hardest to not let rage get to me. I made sure their motives were clear I'd go as far as asking them why and trying to make sure myself. Which also helps when reporting them if they admit to it.\n\nAs I climb further from D4 I notice it less also could be due to the new mute all feature that I use in rank A LOT, but I cannot deny the accuracy may be a bit off.

Master and GM smurfs typically do though, but eh, it's just one game. You don't get those high tier smurfs often.\n\nWhat concerns me is the people that throw on their smurfs or boost other players on their smurf.

Each credit card can only be used once/server. The data would be saved for account, and anyone who uses the account could use, or even see it. You can't unbound your credit card without giving a new one right away. The name on the new card must always be identical with the old one.

Plus, what about those who are too young to have a credit card or dont want to use it?\nNgl, I dont rly like to have a 12 yo yasuo main in my ranked game, but the game isnt age restricted, so it makes no sense to prevent them from playing.\nI, for example, never used my credit card in this game, I bought everything through my phone, and i certainly dont want to give my credit card info to an incompetent company as riot just so i can play f2p game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Magnesium14","date":"2019-08-14T15:50:38.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Midg3t,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=olBwxLMH,comment-id=00090000,timestamp=2019-08-14T14:22:01.627+0000)\n>\n> And what if some1 hacks riot and get thier hands on all credit card infos?
