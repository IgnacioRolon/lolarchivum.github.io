People will have bad games, people will feed. Pretty certain YOU feed in some of your games. Even the best players in the game feed in some of their games. All I see in this game is him killing the same guy over and over and then complaining because he did nothing else. How about he goes and instead of killing the Irelia for the 10th time he went and got his mid laner some kills? or relaived pressure somewhere? nah, better kill ythe irelia for the 15th time! that is using the lead properly! maybe instead of hoarding all the kill he should have given some of those to some of his teammates so that they could catch up.
