I've been trying to power level my Account so I can get to 30 asap. But this extended time on the updating process is just dastardly. I'd bought $10 of RP to get a 1 day XP boost and a 10 win XP boost on 11/19/14 but now the timed boost is pretty much over. But surely, it was my fault for buying it in the first place when the message came up a few days ago. I should really learn to read the notifications more often. I just thought I'd waste anybody's time that decided to read this. lawl.

If you bought a time boost, it should be extended for the amount of time the servers have been offline.  If you did not get an additional ~17 hours added to your time boost once the servers were brought back online, make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to let us know!  You paid for that time, and we will make sure you have the opportunity to use it!","replies":[{"poster":"SavagePenetrator","date":"2014-11-20T19:47:37.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry this is off topic but I need a support specialists help, My account has been attempting to reconnect to a game for over an hour now.
