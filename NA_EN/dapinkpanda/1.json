This is a reason why all disconnections are treated as equals and why penalties cannot be modified or removed.\n\nAdditionally, you'll never receive a 5-game penalty for a single match. It takes a trend of disconnections before you see such a penalty. In this instance, it sounds like the Windows Game Bar may have been the cause of your issue, so I recommend [disabling this feature entirely](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html).\n\nLet me know if you have any more issues crashing after turning off that feature.","replies":[]}]}
