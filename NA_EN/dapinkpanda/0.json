Everything went fine. The client searched for a game for the normal 2/3 mins that it takes, and when i got in the game we selected our champions. \r\n\r\nAnd this is here the problem starts. The client closes down and opens the game, and i see the borders for the champions. The only problem was that there came no champion, and none of the players who should have loaded at least 30% by now. Showed up. \r\nSo i did as i usually do when something remotely close to this error happens. I press (Alt+Esc) to exit the game so i can see if its a bug-splat. When the game closed down and i was on my desktop, there was no bug-splat error to be seen. I wonder how, and i clicked into the client again.  I saw a quick flicker of my teams borders and champions, but then the screen went black. I exited the game again to see if it now had come up with a bug splat error. Still no bug-splat error to be seen i closed the game completely. I started LoL up again, wrote my password and login, and when the client started up. I immediately clicked the \"Reconnect\" button. I now sow all the players borders with the champions and percentage in them. I thought \"I'll just wait and see what happens\" i waited for 30 seconds, and still nothing had moved. None of the players percentages had moved. And i who has a decently good connection with LAN cable coming directly from our router. Was still in deep confusion, with why the game wouldn't launch. I pressed Alt+Esc again and went to check if there was a problem with my GPU or CPU. While checking, i heard the spawning sound of the game, and the sound of the game was playing. I clicked in on the game again, but the game was stuck, it was frozen. My champ standing still in a awkward position, and my timer or fps not moving either. I Exited the game again, and every time i open and close the game, its stuck in a frozen position, with all sound and all  movement off. \r\n\r\nI'm sitting here, asking if anyone can help me. Or if anyone is having the same problems.\r\nI'm sorry for the 4 other players who have to play the game without me. Its a definite loose, and i'm sorry that u will lose that lp.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-06T17:24:28.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is having trouble connecting to the game server, with the black screen being an example because it can't download assets.
