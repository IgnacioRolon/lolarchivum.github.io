Out of the over 70 I have reported so far (combined club tags and summoner names) I have noticed about 3 have been removed or changed. I have a feeling most of the tickets are just closed due to workload or something.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-12T21:28:38.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not the case, we take bad names pretty seriously and will also ban accounts if necessary.  Unfortunately, sometimes another player may pick that up and I think that's something we can be better about tackling.  I promise you, though, we don't like these names anymore than you and the reports go a long way.  I hope that helps offer some relief!","replies":[{"poster":"TheViper7911","date":"2017-07-12T21:35:45.088+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand and agree with what you are saying. I also understand behavior tickets are sub contracted out to a third party who may be more interested in closing tickets as opposed to getting something done about it.\n\nMy personal experience differs in two ways:\n\n1) The N word type names and other racist names I have reported have not been removed, and have not been picked up by new players as you mentioned. They still have games in their match history with my account. If a new player snagged the name, the level would reset and the match history would be gone, I would imagine.\n\n2) I have opened tickets on players (4 guys that queue together) spamming the N word in chat during a game. One player did it maybe 50-100 times in a single game. Reported him and moved on. Then I ran into him a week later doing the exact same thing. He stated he will never get banned for it. Kind of looks like he was correct, because I opened a ticket on those guys with a screen shot. Ticket #30781703. Those guys are all still playing without any 14 day gaps in their match history.\n\nNot attempting to argue or complain, only trying to bring the problem to someones attention that a lot of these guys fall through the cracks when it seems the automated system should pick them up fairly easily - I see many chat logs on the boards posted with players claiming they were perma banned and they have only one or two racial slurs in the logs.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-12T21:56:01.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The perception that support agents are inclined to close tickets as soon as possible is a bit disheartening. I know plenty personally who bleed and breathe player focus.  Looking at the ticket you posted, I saw that the club name reported was addressed.  The in-game chat is really bad and I hate that your teammates had to see it, but the reporting tool will help address cases like this.  Reports are crucial, otherwise it's difficult to prioritize who we're looking at and get better context.\n\nI know you're not trying to argue or complain, and actually I really appreciate your passion.  We don't always share what actions we take against another player, and that can be frustrating.  We look at your tickets and we're focused on solving pain.  We also make mistakes or bad judgement calls, but we want to make things right for anyone who reaches out to us.\n\nWe can always do better, and this kind of feedback helps a lot.  If there is a way we can improve visibility or how we handle something, we need to hear from you.  Now I'm not part of the Player Behavior Development team, so I can't really speak on how to make improvements to systems.  As far as Player Support goes, though, I'm going to forward your feedback to the PB support team for consideration.  \n\nI've probably ranted a bit, but I hear you and appreciate these concerns.
