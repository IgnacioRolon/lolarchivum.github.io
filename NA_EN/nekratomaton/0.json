If that works (and the install completes), just copy/paste (or cut/paste) the install onto your E into a new folder like 'League of Legendstest'. If it copies over, give it a whirl, see if that works.\n\nFrom what limited view I can see on your pictures, your may have a corrupted file directory, which is why you can't do anything to that location. It might require a full format of your external hard drive to properly fix if you need that exact directory back. If it's completely unrecoverable and those sectors are unwriteable in general, your actual hard drive may have an error on that section of the platter.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nekratomaton","date":"2018-03-22T20:50:52.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://imgur.com/a/A3ess This is what it looks like when I try to install it.","replies":[]}]}
