I just do not see it. I purchased the 50x Win Boost and the 7-Day Win Boost a couple days ago, and just can't seem to find it on the client so I can track them.\r\n\r\n{{champion:53}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-06T19:30:09.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The updated client is still in testing so you may see cases where boosts are not visible.  For now you can return to the legacy client to double check:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nLet me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Lyonyde","date":"2017-01-06T19:33:59.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ohh okay! I was trying that but it kept giving me an error, running as admin fixed it though thankfully :).\n\nThank you for the response, I look forward to the finished client, since it definitely is really nicely made.\n\n{{champion:53}}","replies":[]}]}]}
