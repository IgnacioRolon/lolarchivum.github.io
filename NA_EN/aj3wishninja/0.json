Now it will open the client and i can look at the menus but when the game tries to load it crashes and pulls up the bug reporter. I tried letting it load and doing the keystroke again but it crashes before the game loads. I can't change it in the config file cause I can't find that and I have no idea what is going on. Any help would be great.\r\n\r\nI just wanted to play and watch march madness.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-27T01:25:41.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If alt+enter doesn't seem to do anything but crash the game (rip) you can always try switching to windowed mode from the in-game settings. \n\nEnter into a Custom Game - > Press escape -> click the Video tab -> Select Windowed from the drop box at the top right\n\nLet me know if that helps!","replies":[]}]}
