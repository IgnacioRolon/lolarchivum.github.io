I was playing bot lane versing an adc Kog&#039;Maw and the sound his passive before blowing up is repeatedly replayed through the entirety of the game (without his passive being activated). An example of the sound can be found here https://youtu.be/Q73vnCdXHa4?t=23 . I was in a skype call with my friends and they said they all experienced this bug at the same times. The sound effect seemed to be heard more clearly when closer to Kog&#039;Maw but people across the other side of the map still witnessed hearing it. I only experienced the bug this one time as i have not yet versed a Kog&#039;Maw since or before then. This is not a major issue but does become quite annoying and irritating after awhile of the sound frequently playing about every 3-4 seconds approximately. Just to clarrify, it is the sound Kog&#039;Maw makes to additionally amp up his explosion.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-18T18:18:31.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey DustyHD,\n\nThanks for the report!

If he was Zillianed it would continue while he was \"dead\" and stop only when he revived. \n\nThird game Butterfly Kog v Draven Every death he'd do the noise.\n\nI've only really noticed it with the butterfly skin as the others do not do it as much, I'm assuming it might be the skin messing up the sounds or something.","replies":[]}]}
