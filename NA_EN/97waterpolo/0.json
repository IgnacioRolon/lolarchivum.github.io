When I click the button at the bottom that states \"I want to help\" it stalls and eventually takes me to an error page (http://siglerdev.us/photoupload/2017_01_16_19_38_31.png). Does this occur for anyone else as I would like to try and signup for PBE access.\r\n\r\nThank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-17T21:44:03.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, the images don't show up anything for me.
