They are still learning like what items to buy and what the jungle camps are for and really basic stuff like that so anything they could learn from playing against a level 30 player is lost on them. Unless perhaps they are playing on the same team as them and are able to observe without getting blown up instantly, but even then, they are still lacking basic game knowledge. \n\nGood for you for giving advice, but most smurfs stomp and move on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashZedMain","date":"2018-03-30T07:53:23.109+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrHaZeYo,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=k1KnpITk,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-04-14T07:50:33.722+0000)\n>\n> Actually, you&#x27;ll get better playing vs smurfs, you&#x27;ll hit 30 way better then most players would of back in my day.\n> \n> When I smurf though I usually give advice.\n\nNah, trust me playing against smurfs didn't make me better. It made me want to stop playing because i could never win.

I'm pretty new to league and i get matched against golds in ranked games, and some diamonds in my normals games so dont try to sell me the its equall. Riot was the dumbest matchmaking system and nothing is equal in matchmaking.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DrTeath","date":"2018-03-30T08:34:25.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some folks smurf to help a newbie learn the game , usually a friend . \n\nSome folk smurf because they are bad and like beating on new players so they can win once in a while . \n\nSome folk smurf because they want to experience leveling up to 30 again.\n\nAnd then there a the folk who smurf because they got permabanned , and have no other recourse if they want to keep playing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Doseus3","date":"2018-10-02T19:49:45.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So many smurf's because so many player's have fragile ego's.
