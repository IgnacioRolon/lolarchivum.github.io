When I go into a game skin select for this champion and select Koi Nami skin the chroma packs do show up. Once I select the Gold one it defaults in game to the regular one. The white one doesn&#039;t work at all now. The purple one chooses the white one. I paid for this pack to work correctly, please fix this. I have already tried selecting the default skin then the Koi then the chroma. That didn&#039;t work.  Last night the gold skin worked for a few games now it doesn&#039;t work at all again.

First off, thank you so much for taking the time to report this bug. I'm really sorry that you're experiencing these problems.\n\nIf you have the time, do you mind providing me with some more info about what's happening? Like were you queued up with friends or alone? Did you experience this on Team Builder or something else?\n\nAlso, if you experience this again weirdness again and have the time to grab some files, it would be super useful to us if you could post the following files too!\n\n* r3dlog (just get the last modified one if you experienced the bug in your previous match): C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Logs\\Game - R3d Logs\n* AirClient log (get the last modified one if you experienced the bug in your previous Champ Select): C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client\\releases\\0.0.1.155\\deploy\\logs\n* SQLITE file (get the file named \"gameStats_en_US.sqlite\"):  C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client\\releases\\0.0.1.155\\deploy\\assets\\data\\gameStats\n\nThanks a bunch for the help!

We're trying to nail down some solid reproduction steps to mimic what's happening here on our side, so any information on the steps you're taking to trigger this bug would be very helpful!\n\nFor example:\n1. Queue up either solo or in a party.\n2. Enter Champ Select (unless it's Team Builder).\n3. Select Nami.\n4. Click on the Koi Nami skin card.\n5. Click on a single Chroma swatch.\n6. Change Runes.\n7. Change Masteries. \n8. Enter game.\n\nDo you do these in a different order? Are there steps missing--like cycling between the other Nami skin cards first?","replies":[{"poster":"Goddess Krystal","date":"2015-08-24T12:31:13.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot LoveStrut I have an update on this. I found out what is happening. Its a bug on Riots  UI that cant be seen unless you manipulate the selection screen to see it. When a chroma skin is chosen and the cursor moves to close the skin select, it actually is changing back to the Koi Nami default skin. So its not that it isnt reading the actual chromas, its that its switching it back to the default before you move into the game. I can reproduce the bug.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Goddess Krystal","date":"2015-08-19T00:50:43.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is the other","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hi its eva","date":"2016-01-03T17:43:43.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having the same issue for two weeks now.

Enter Champ Select.\n2. Select Nami.\n3. Click on Koi Nami skin card.\n4. Click on one of the Chromas swatches.\n5. If in Team Builder, click on the Done button to close the selection window. If outside of Team Builder, click on the \"Champions\" tab to close the skin selection? (I'm just a little confused on the \"and the cursor moves to close the skin select\" part.)\n6. Lock In.\n7. Observe that the Gold and White chromas load in as regular Koi Nami and the Purple chroma loads in as the White chroma?","replies":[{"poster":"Goddess Krystal","date":"2015-09-01T10:52:23.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi\nThis issue now has gotten worse.
