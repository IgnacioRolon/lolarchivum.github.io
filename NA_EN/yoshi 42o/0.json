People are toxic in general. How can you sit there and say &quot;I only want nice people to play my game, even though they have spent a lot of their hard earned money for further enjoyment&quot;\r\n\r\nI admit.. sometimes I get excessive with language and the way that I speak to people on this game... but to permanently ban my account so easily... I mean look... if you&#039;re going to perma ban someone... at least ban them for a month first... or 3 months... or even 6 months. I understand, lots of people share the perspective that someone who talks shit should be gone permanently... but you might as well be saying that anyone that talks shit should be dead. You think people gave a damn about someone talking shit back in the medieval ages? We are at war in league. Some of us have had hard lives and use video games as an outlet instead of raging in real life. Some of us get raged at in life growing up and use video games as an escape from this and can find themselves raging in game. Not everyone gets to grow up in nice setting with a good family or people around that respect them.\r\n\r\nOn my account I had every single champion... so many skins... full tab of rune pages... history... and now it&#039;s just gone with no chance of return? How can that be fair? I was unaware, at the time, that you get perma ban directly after 14 day chat restriction... If I had known.. I most definitely wouldn&#039;t have said anything at all. I&#039;ve been chat restricted a lot over the years because I&#039;m an angry mother fucker... I thought it was something like that... but no... BAM perma ban first game back after 14 day suspension LOL.

People have been having fun talking shit since Ultima Online in the 90s. The amount of money someone spends on their account should have a huge say in it to.. since League of Legends wouldn't even update the way that they do if it wasn't for people like me who supported the game so much for so long. I've played league since season 1 and have supported it with quite a lot of money.

People come to play to relax, not to listen to some kid raging and flaming because he is losing. I also have all champs, around 400 skins, have been playing for 3 years, and never got even a chat restriction. It was your choice to flame, even tho u KNEW that flaming is not allowed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2016-08-29T11:58:22.178+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yoshi 42o,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=jAuVX141,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2016-08-29T11:44:48.422+0000)\n>\n> Yeah I didn&#x27;t get the e-mail.

If they are, they at least have the common decency to hide it and be respectful or a semblance thereof in public. People who aren't respectful in public either get their teeth kicked in or worse. Your argument falls flat in that regard, because people do not tolerate shit talking in the real world, even in the middle ages that you bring up; the shit talking that is tolerated at sporting events doesn't even come remotely close to the vile spew I see from some players in this game.\n\nYou clearly disregarded the punishments you received and that's why you lost your account. You knew this. Everyone knows this. It's not some big secret that if you continue to be toxic after a punishment, you will get punished again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-08-29T11:36:15.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having a hard life doesn't make it right to take it out on others in real life or online.
