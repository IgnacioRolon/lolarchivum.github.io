We also don't change patches during the LCS Playoffs to ensure more consistency - we value adaptability to the meta as part of the regular season and the \"long run\" game, but don't find it appropriate for playoffs.  Worlds is a special case - our tolerance for potential bugs is _much_ lower.\n\ntl;dr Ale non è male nailed it.","replies":[{"poster":"Jbels","date":"2015-11-12T20:34:38.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tiza,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=qIu34QFw,comment-id=000100010001,timestamp=2015-11-12T18:50:43.659+0000)\n>\n> We usually patch Tournament Realms (the special servers we use for competition) a week after a patch goes live, primarily to avoid any hotfix issues (things that result in \"X has been temporarily disabled\" popups).
