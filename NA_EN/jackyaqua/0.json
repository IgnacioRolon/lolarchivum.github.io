I don't know how much Sona is helping my damage, in fact I tend to forget she actually even is. Same thing goes with Aegis, janna's global move speed buff etc.\n\n\nEDIT: I am not saying Auras need to provide more stats to be noticeable, but explaining that due to their nature, it's hard to tell how much auras have helped you which make them lack luster and easy to forget about.","replies":[{"poster":"ItemsGuy","date":"2014-05-18T21:21:45.981+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Passive auras that simply provide statistical bonuses tend to go largely unnoticed, but buffing them to the point of noticeability will often create a large amount of invisible power that isn't healthy for the game. \n\nAura-like bonuses that affect gameplay, however (having trouble thinking of actual in-game examples, but think of if, say, instead of providing a flat armor bonus to nearby allies, he passively buffed them with a damage-absorbing shield over time), can create coherent gameplay patterns ie. \"stay next to this guy if I want this positive effect\" or \"stay away from this guy if I do not want this negative effect\". \n\nIt's not a problem with aura-type effects, but rather how those effects have been incorporated so far.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Whist","date":"2014-05-19T00:14:34.684+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not saying they go unnoticed because they don't provide a big enough boost, but because there is nothing ingame that says \"hey you're moving X units faster\" or \"hey you are dealing X more damage per attack\" because of an aura.","replies":[{"poster":"ItemsGuy","date":"2014-05-19T00:49:42.965+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, I probably misspoke--what I meant was, by the nature of flat statistical bonuses (\"you're moving X units faster\" not being something that's broadcasted to those affected unless temporary/situational, like Talisman's active effect or Boots of Mobility), they are a lot harder to notice, but they can't be buffed in their current state because, aside from not providing much gameplay (unless the aura is limited to a very short range, like Sunfire's aura), they won't really become noticeable until the bonuses they provide are simply too powerful. While I agree with all of this, it's also mostly what I inferred/learned about when a bunch of the other designers were talking about aura items and why they couldn't be directly buffed (and why Aegis's old upgrade had to be removed).\n\nWhile you might not immediately notice when your movespeed or AD is increased by a small flat amount, those numbers can be increased to the point where you do--but not before the item becomes so powerful that it chokes all other options out! This is very dangerous for anything that is largely unaffected by gameplay, because it ends up becoming a battle of who can out-stat who, which isn't super healthy for the game.\n\n**TL;DR** - While the lack of in-game feedback doesn't help, flat statistical bonuses tend to not be that noticeable unless they're temporary (eg. Talisman's movespeed boost) or situational (eg. Boots of Mobility's out-of-combat movespeed boost)--partially due to the static nature of teamwide auras, and partially because their power is directly limited by the lack of gameplay they provide. You get Boots of Mobility if you want to take on a roaming playstyle, you get Talisman if you want to be able to quickly engage or disengage fights, but you only get flat auras when you want to help your team constantly out-stat the enemy team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tortferngatr","date":"2014-05-19T05:09:44.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm.

It's gotten to the stage now where the utility of a support is being over-ridden by the extra damage a character ignoring support roles/builds can bring. The likes of Annie, Morgana, and even just standard mid-laners with no real CC can be subbed in, and the damage buff they get from their GP5 item is sufficient to suppress the early game and gain the arc enough of a lead for the utility to be irrelevant. And there's nothing supports can do to answer that early-game strength other than *maybe* build to match the damage, if they're the right champion.\n\nEven after that early game, the utility can be overwhelmed later game for the same reason; that early lead has quashed any non-tank support. \n\nI think giving more generous support-oriented items to buff allies should be considered heavily; something tuned to mean that a game playing a duo damage bot can be negated by a support build adding more damage/defences to their team, not themselves.","replies":[{"poster":"the Anarchit3cht","date":"2014-05-24T02:53:15.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is a problem, but I don't think buffing support items is a viable option either. If they provide too strong of a bonus, then they become toxic due to the lack of input needed on behalf of the support.

In most games i'm unlikely to get anywhere near a full build, and in those situations, I generally run one of two builds depending on AD or AP support champion. \n\nI'd love to see some more variety in those options; Take the sight-stone. 800g isn't a major cost, but it's an item that takes up a slot for most of the game, and is generally considered must-have for supports. But running without a support, you're spending 800g on a health-benefit worth 400g, and the extra wards mean nothing, because the power-spike that 800g can give to an opponent buying damage means a gank isn't even necessary for them to take control of the lane. \n\nI'd love to see the sightstone re-classified as a trinket; no health bonus, and a 400g immediate cost to take, but with the same full-ward benefits of the sightstone, minus the natural re-generation the current ward trinket has. It can even have a longer activation time when buying, say 3 minutes, so that it doesn't come into play until the landing phase should be underway. At least that was the cost of that clutch item is reduced early on, and the options for the extra 400g saved are wider; i can buy a health gem and build it into something that uses it more efficiently for a health bonus, for instance.

If the aura is a passive to round out a champion who also has a lot of tactical abilities, then it's typically fine. If the auras have a large gameplay impact, then there is a risk that your champion doesn't have to work or pay attention to benefit from the passive benefit, your team doesn't have to pay attention to identify the window when they can most benefit from synergy with your bonus, and consequently, there isn't much the enemy team can do to shut it down.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-05-19T22:54:50.115+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Apart from killing Sona.
