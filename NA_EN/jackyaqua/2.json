It's just so ... so ... *wrong*.  \n\nSo here's my Olaf: \n(No, I will not name the errors in his current kit. They should be fairly obvious.)  \n \n| -- -- -- --  \n|-  \n\n \n*My Olaf is centered around his E.  \nHis kit is actually tailored around him spamming that at his helpless enemies. *\n \n#General:   \n\n - **Movement Speed**: ~~350~~ --> 335   \n \n|-- -- -- --  \n|- \n\n\n**Passive - Berserker's Rage**  \n Olaf's rage allows him to ignore unit collision.\n Olaf gains 20% less Attack Speed-%. However, for every 1% Attack Speed 'lost', he gains a 1% increase in self-healing, Health Regen, Lifesteal, and Spell Vamp effects.\nCurrent amount: X  \n\n**Q - Undertow**    \n\n - Range: 400 - 1100  \n - Missile Speed: 1600  \n - Cost: 45/50/55/60/65 Mana  \n - Cooldown: 3 seconds <- This is affected by CDR, not the readying time. \n\nEvery 16/15/14/13/12 seconds Olaf readies an ax to throw. He can have 2 axes at one time, since he only has 2 hands and his name is Olaf, not Zorro (or is it?). \nPicking up an ax lowers the time needed to ready the next ax by 10 seconds. \n\nOlaf throws one of his axes at a target location, dealing 60/85/110/135/160 (+30% AD) physical damage to units it passes through.  \nAdditionally, units hit have 24/28/32/36/40 - 60% (depending on the distance it traveled) reduced Movement Speed and 14/18/22/26/30% reduced Attack Speed for 2 seconds. Both effects diminish over their duration to a minimum of 10%.\n\nThe ax remains at the target location until its readying time is over. Olaf can pick up the axes to lower their readying times by 10 seconds. If an ax would land inside terrain, it will stick to the wall instead.\n  \n**W - Vicious Strikes**  \n\n - No Cost  \n - Cooldown: 18/17/16/15/14 seconds  \n  \n**Passive**: Killing a unit reduces the cooldown of Vicious Strikes by 0.5 seconds.\n**Active**: For 6 seconds, Olaf gains 45/60/75/90/105% Attack Speed and his basic attacks grant 15 - ( 25 + (5% bonus AD)) Movement Speed for 2 seconds on-hit, based on his missing Health. \n   \n\n**E - Reckless Swing**  \n\n - Range: 325  \n - Cost: 4% of current Health + 60/50/40/30/20 Mana\n - Cooldown: 3 seconds\n\n\nOnly after **recently** attacking three times can you activate this ability (similar to Volibear). Using it on an enemy champion lowers the required attacks for the next cast to 2, then to 1, if you successively use it on champions. Using it on an non-champion unit resets the count to 3.  \n\n\nOlaf attacks a target enemy, dealing 40/50/60/70/80 (+100% AD) + 4% of the targets missing Health as physical damage to the target. This ability applies on-hit effects, cannot, however, critically strike.   \n\n**R - Ragnarok**  \n\n - Cost: 8% of current Health\n - Cooldown 110/100/90 seconds\n \n\n**Passive**: Olaf gains 10% of his bonus Attack Damage as bonus Health Regen.\n**Active**: On activation, Olaf removes all crowd control effects on himself, then for the next 7 seconds becomes immune to all slowing effects.  \nDuring the duration, Olaf's abilities ignore 50% of the enemies' bonus Armor and whenever Olaf kills or assists in the kill of an enemy champion, he restores 6% of his missing Health instantly and gains 30% Movement Speed for 1 second.   \n\n\n----   \n\n#Explanation  \n\n**Passive - Berserker's Rage** \nOne of the biggest problems with the current Olaf is that he simply has too much free Attack Speed, while still being heavily spell-reliant. \nThe many auto-attacks and the point five second cooldown on his axes simply didn't work together all too well. \n\nSo his passive reduces Attack Speed by 20% now. That means, if you buy Dagger you only get 12% Attack Speed and in exchange a 3% increase to heals.  \nHis kit is quite powerful, so I doubt the Attack Speed will be missed.  \nThen, I removed the Lifesteal from his kit. If he wants some he can buy it. Having Lifesteal in your kit and a permenant Heal-increase simply seemed too strong. This should compensate.\n\nAdditionally, his passive allows him to walk through units, which should  help him survive in lane against certain champions who can just roll over minions and destructo-beam everything to dust (Riven, Renekton, Ryze, etc.).    \nThen ... his ... \n\n**Q - Undertow**  \n\nThis ability I changed from spam-to-barely-survive-in-lane spell to a nice utility spell that should give him a certain degree of purpose, with healthier game-play and more strategics.   \n \nThe new Q does less damage, as you can use it twice at the beginning of the fight. Afterwards it's very similar to his current Q, with about a 1 second longer cooldown.  \nMy idea was to give him some mediocre AoE damage and CC that he could toss around in high amounts at the beginning of the teamfight. Hence two axes, and the longer range, and that's also why it doesn't only have a slow now, but also an Attack Speed slow, which should make him viable in more top lane comps, like against Aatrox or someone. He could be the new Lee Sin for that.  \n\nHowever, the Mana Cost on Undertow is somewhat higher in the late game now, and since then your auto-attacks would deal more damage, it would be wise to only use Undertow once the slow has diminished - to re-apply it. And not to spam it as your only damage source like with the current Olaf.  \n  \n\n**W - Vicious Strikes**  \nThis ability, I believe, would be a whole lot weaker than it currently is.  \nThe current Olaf uses this as his only source of survival. He has no gap-closer, no Movement Speed boost, no shield, only the massive Lifesteal of Vicious Strikes.  \n\nWell, yeah, I removed that :D  \nA higher Attack Speed boost, lower Cooldown and bonus Movement Speed should make up for it.  \nThough the Attack Speed boost does actually remain almost the same.   \nIt's actual numbers, because of the passive, would be  +36/48/60/72/84% Attack Speed, which is almost identical to the current Olaf's W, plus the +9/12/15/18/21% increase in heals, which you get for 6 seconds.  \nYou'd need to be at 18-42% missing Health to get that with the current Olaf. With mine you have that at full Health. Mmhmmm.  \nOlaf has a purpose now. Sustain-guy, minion-ignorer, slow-master, ... haven't explained the rest yet ^^   \n  \nSo all in all, I basically switched the 9-21% Lifesteal for a lower cooldown, more mobility and a safer heal-amplifier.  \nOn to the next one...  \n\n**E - Reckless Swing**  \n\nThe core of his kit. The main damage source. The Kha' Zix-Q-Volibear-Bite-Hybrid.  \nAh, I love it ^^  \nI don't think there's much to explain. It doesn't interfere with Attack Speed since it counts as basic Attack, and should be on auto-smart cast.   \nIt makes use of the Attack Speed boost of his Viscous Strikes by having to attack 3-1 times before being able to use it.  \nAnd I imagine in the late-game it would be Q, Basic Attack, Basic Attack, Basic Attack, Q,  E, Basic Attack, Basic Attack, E, Q, Basic Attack, E, Basic Attack, E, etc. etc.  \nAfter a while you can spam it and melt down a target's health.  \n(Though it does cost you your own Health.)   \nIt's fairly balanced, I think, and if you buy Life Steal you can make use of your passive and balance out its cost.  \nBe wary of bursts, though.   \n\n**R - Ragnarok**  \n\nMy Ragnarok offers a nice little passive that should partially make up for the missing Lifesteal, but also grant you a certain freedom in spamming your E in lane.  \nIt's based on Attack Damage and allows for offensive build paths. Otherwise I see it working well together with Atma's and Warmog's.  \n\nThen, Ragnarok is the ability that completes the kit.  \nYou can still use it to get rid of CC, but only once like Alistar. It simply seemed too strong if I made it ignore all CC. It still ignores slows, though, like Master Yi, so you can stick to your targets.  \n  \nThen it offers you A LOT of damage by making your Q and E ignore 50% of the targets' bonus Armor, and if you, with that damage, kill someone, you get healed *and* get a boost to carry on with the fray.  \nIt's a neat addition to the rest of the kit that just buffs things up a little.   \n\n----  \n\nThat's all!  \n  \nI do hope you liked it. I can only hope Riot at least takes inspiration from it, as I'd really like to see Olaf get some love.  \n  \nThanks for reading, and as always... \n\nOpinions?  \n\nJack","replies":[{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2014-09-04T14:03:35.100+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Current Olaf builds a lot of tankiness and about 1 damage item, relying on base stats/abilities more than their ratios to deal damage. \n\nYour Olaf has a severe identity crisis. All your abilities tell you to build offence, but you'll simply die if you do that. Your Olaf just gets kited, burst, or ignored depending on what he builds. What is he supposed to do and how does his kit allow him to do this? \n\nCurrent Olaf is supposed to go tank, wait for the right moment to ult and go kill the enemy carry in his ult duration. He has the tools to do this. I'm not saying it's a good pattern for the game, but it is the pattern his kit is designed and balanced around.\n\nAlso, I personally would avoidattack speed slows, they are countering a very specific subset of champions hard and noone else.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-07T07:16:28.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really love the Q idea but the other part of the kit can be some overpowered IMO","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tannis FireBeard","date":"2015-01-06T19:28:00.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I look at how Olaf's ult negates cc, I imagine that he's meant to go straight for the carries and remove them from the fight, but with a growing number of these carries having access to high mobility skills, such as Ezreal's [E], Olaf only has a small window before the late game damage overwhelms him before he can even reach them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mr Sir Lebowski","date":"2014-10-30T15:45:57.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the way his kit works it just needs buffed\n\nQ is in an ok position\n\nW > needs to last 8 seconds like WW, not 6. It already has a higher CD, doesn't help your team and lasts about 30% less time than WW. Ofc it has the other bonuses but the other bonuses are really only helpful if you are able to hit someone and the 6 second window limits this.\n\nE > perhaps this could perform a knockup or root something, his Q is nice for a permaslow but it's not enough with other junglers having multiple hard CC or gap closers with hard CC\n\nR > it needs to last longer or maybe give him true sight while it's active, something ancillary. Or maybe if they can't put hard CC for him anywhere else it could be here. Perhaps when he enters bezerker rage his E will now stun opponents when it hits. Not too OP for a melee CC on a relatively longer CD that is only active during his ult. Perhaps just add a movement speed buff to it similar to ghost which would allow him to take flash instead of ghost as a summoner. They could always just lower the CD on this greatly so it would be active for more teamfights. It's already a dangerous ability for him to use since he doesn't have gap closers and must commit with it.\n\nAll in all he probably needs at least 1 form of hard CC or an added mobility option so he can take flash instead of ghost. I just like playing his kit the way it is. I would hope that they would only add something to his existing abilities than change him a lot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mezmerize009","date":"2014-10-30T15:15:15.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like where this is going, however i feel he simply needs a rework to become viable again. He was a beast when health stacking armor tanks would wreck face. WE ALL HEARD THE HORROR STORIES OF THE CANCER OLAF. We Olaf fans just want to play a viable champ that isnt like in the 105th win rate - I mean is that too much to ask? Now kiting him is way to easy, his ult is only 6 seconds, his w is awkward, the axe needs work (I like the idea of 2 with longer cds), and overall his inability to gap close or stick to the enemy make him useless in temfights. Losing mr and armor during your ult, you have 6 seconds to run in to the enemy team, assuming you're not first, and wont just die to kiting and bork, to kill the adc? You need like 3 or 4 items to even notice any change in usefulness and by then he has already fallen off. Monster duelist will only get you so far in a team game of adc domination. Probably get a turret and a couple kills, then fall off. The only teams he works well against is super low damage high cc. aka never. He's one of my favorite champs, love the BROOOOOOOO and BOOM, i have brolaf and glacial skins, however, he definitely got olaf'ed. RIP Bro. :'(","replies":[]}]}
