I get a short ban and its no big deal. but today It's happened multiple times (twice so far I just realized how exaggerative I was) and im up to 15 minute waits... I have no clue but could there be some sort of feature youd be able to add some point down the road that only puts a 5 minute ban on people who crash during champ select? \r\n\r\nas im writing this complaint (yes I realize im just complaining cause im so damn impatient to wait 15 minutes) I just realize im doing it in the boards... ill go write in \"ask\" or maybe the support ticket page will at least read it. Derp :P\r\n\r\nBut yeah I get that maybe the problem is on my end but I kinda got a highpowered custom made desktop and I ran a scan for viruses and double checked my internet connection... my client just crashes every once in a while (usually after a big update) and its kinda lame that I gotta wait 15 minutes (half a league match) just to start one due to a problem that from my perspective isn't my fault. then again it could be but I did all the basic troubleshooting except deleting and re-downloading. but whens the last time you delete a big download just to spend 3 hours watching it redownload and it still have the same problem. I did it just the other day ill tell you that.","replies":[{"poster":"Hungfu","date":"2016-07-24T02:58:26.652+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same.

When the client experiences a drop in connection to the server, it can cause delays in what you see in champ select or crash the client entirely. Since it's possible to have a good connection to one site or service, but not another, there may be some local configurations causing issues for you in League. Our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) goes over the most common solutions for improving your connection. \n\nLet me know if you continue to see the issues after working through this guide.","replies":[]}]}
