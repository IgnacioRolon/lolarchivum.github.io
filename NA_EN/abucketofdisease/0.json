The measurement of how good or bad a champion is is how good the people who play him are with them, and about %75 of the time the people who play him are bad with him, due to the fact that they usually don&#039;t expect him to be that difficult to play, but if you play someone like Malzahar, Irelia, or any ADC then you will not be prepared to play Azir, for a strong midlaner with high mobility like azir that&#039;s much easier to manage try Lissandra, she has high damage and due to the E, Good mobility a somewhat difficult champion to be sure but not that bad once you get the hang of it, And if you do plan on picking up Azir Just make sure you can focus on multiple things at once. That&#039;s honestly the biggest difficulty people seem to have with him. I&#039;ll post the best build in the comments. ( also will pull if you believe in him as much as me)","replies":[{"poster":"PureSilvrr","date":"2016-12-15T03:28:01.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But malz isn't busted though...","replies":[{"poster":"ABucketOfDisease","date":"2016-12-15T04:10:07.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a silence that does 400 damage when he has two components to rabbadon's isn't busted?","replies":[{"poster":"PureSilvrr","date":"2016-12-15T19:40:08.149+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:31}} 's silence is more broken than malz's, and his q is his only form of Immediate damage.

Azir is a Somewhat Squishy champion But that doesn't matter if you can outrange your enemy Max q r and w and you should be able to stay far away and still do damage (The sand solders replace auto attacks if they are in range of enemies)\n2: Escapes. don't forget that he has amazing escape potential With R W E Q combo you can put Large gaps (OR close them ) between yourself and enemies\n3:The Build. Doran's ring first And refillable potion on first back then turn that into corrupting potion. !!!ALWAYS GET NASHOR'S TOOTH RABADON'S DEATHCAP ZHONYA'S HOURGLASS AND RYLAI'S CRYSTAL SCEPTER!!! In with those get Ionian boots Berserker's Greaves (my preferred one) or Sorcerer's shoes and I usually go for Morellonomicon.\n4:Abilities to max. I usually max W first to Get the huge attack speed advantage Q next to do more damage and I believe it gets a longer range and I also max R because although the shield on E is nice you have to hit an enemy champion to get it and that means being risky which you don't really want to do Which is why R helps so much because of the more damage and Wider spread of the wall.\n5:Summoner's Spells. I usually take barrier and Flash but if you're more confident take ignite.\n\nI doubt many of you care to read this far but just believe me when I say Azir if played right has better survivability then Fizz and better damage then Veigar.\n\nIf you did read this far A sincere thank you as Azir is my favorite Champion and isn't getting that much love as of late.\n\nThank you and good luck on the Rift. :)","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2016-12-15T04:25:50.590+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is pretty good, however maxing Q first makes repositioning your soldiers easier. Plus your soldier damage scales off of your level, not the skill's rank, so maxing W second is better, as your atk speed gain is only useful when you get items.\n\nOther than that, SHURIMA!","replies":[{"poster":"ABucketOfDisease","date":"2016-12-15T13:10:21.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also personally I prefer getting that attack speed boost to help getting out more damage but I suppose I should max Q first since I always get nashor's tooth  first item anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2016-12-15T13:57:37.889+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pro tip about Nashors, buy Stinger, then move on to Rylais. Finish Nashors at the very end.\n\nThe reason is becuase Nashors is very expensive and the benefits it offers over Stinger are not useful till late game. Plus the magic damage on hit passive isn't even useful. \n\nIf you move from Stingers to the rest of your build you can essentially fast forward your build.\n\nFinal tip. Buy Bersekers Greaves if the enemy is all squishy.\n\nBuy sorcerers if they have some tanks.\n\nVery last thing, SHURIMA.","replies":[{"poster":"ABucketOfDisease","date":"2016-12-15T23:45:14.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright I'll try that next game good night and SHURIMA!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ABucketOfDisease","date":"2016-12-15T12:51:00.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh thanks for the Tip :) \nSHURIMA!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-12-15T03:13:30.739+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Azir has the advantage of surprise: everyone thinks he sucks and has no idea what he can do to them if they stand still.","replies":[{"poster":"ABucketOfDisease","date":"2016-12-15T03:20:19.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you finally somebody who supports me last time I posted something about him everybody said he was trash I still believe in him I still believe","replies":[]}]}]}
