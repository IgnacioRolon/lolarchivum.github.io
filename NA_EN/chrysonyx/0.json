But to my misfortune, the game started to load like crap. \r\nFirst off, here are the specs,\r\nProcessor - Intel(R) Core i7 -7700HQ  CPU @ 2.80 GHz\r\nVideo Card (For some reason my integrated is the primary) -  Intel HD Graphics 630\r\nVideo Card #2 - AMD Radeon RX 560 2GB (Most Up to Date Driver)\r\nRAM - 8 GB\r\nOS - Windows 10\r\nSource: https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/my-computer-details\r\nThe strange thing is that when I play other games such as Warframe or War Thunder, the graphics card runs but when I play League it isn't on and reverts to the integrated. This never happened to me in the past as my graphics card worked in League before. At the current moment I simply can't play the game due to it even starting to have trouble loading the main screen. For the most part, the game is jittery so it makes it unplayable for me as I have been used to the graphics card running.\r\nI don't know if the problem lies with AMD or with the game itself because it is odd that this problem only happens in League. \r\n(On a side note, the AMD Catalyst Application does not consider LoL as a game I overclock for some reason.)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-09T19:20:22.629+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There might be more going on here than basic troubleshoot may assist with, it's particularly interesting that your settings are changing this much for League.
