I understand that abilities and passives play a big part, but how do I learn to build effective items for the champs that I play  or understand why I would build a champ the way that its meant to be. If some one would be kind to explain to me how to easily understand items it would be greatly appreciated. I&#039;m not looking how to build a specific champ I&#039;m trying to learn how to build all or any champ I play and how to understand items better.{{summoner:13}}","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2017-03-06T03:03:20.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I'd probably work backwards from probuilds. So look up whatever champion, and see what a pro player built on that champion in a particular game, and then try to figure out the 'why' behind each item (and for bonus points, why in that particular order). Sometimes items are situational based on comps, other times certain items in certain orders are simply mathematically more efficient, other times there are playstyle preferences, or other times it may be due to forced back timings. (Note that in some cases, people have actually pulled out spreadsheets to compare DPS of various builds at different points on different champs, so optimal builds aren't always obviously optimal until you do the math.)\n\nIt's much easier to look at a champion and be given the 'answer' (as pros are usually going to be building optimally, albeit not always) and then justify it yourself, than try to look at a champion, consider all the items out there, and try to figure out which ones are best. Then once you've figured out why a pro built all the items they did on a certain champion in a certain game, do it again for a different champ. Repeat until most probuilds are more or less intuitively obvious to you.\n\nThen try to figure out builds for champs you didn't look up pro builds for using your now somewhat developed intuition. See how what you comes up with differs from what the pros did, and try to figure out why the difference(s) exist.\n\nBeyond that, you can playtest builds. Don't do it in ranked, but once you've got a pretty good understanding of item builds, anything that you think is worthwhile to test out is probably plausibly viable enough that people in normals won't notice/care. (Note I said once you've got a good understanding of item builds though, theres no reason to 'test' AP Garen for example. People have done it, but they're knowingly trolling and/or taking advantage of the fact their 'true' elo is somewhat higher than the one they're playing at, not actually testing it.)\n\nPaying attention to how pro builds change between patches can also be insightful if you can get a feel for how significant buffs/nerfs are and what sort of rippling effects from even non-item changes can result in changes in item builds.","replies":[{"poster":"murderant","date":"2017-03-06T20:20:05.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you! I think this gives me better insight on items. i think situational builds is were I'm lacking. I've been watching lcs and lck games and its been helping. would you normally start core item build or would this change if you fall behind early game? i.e. if I'm facing Camille and shes ahead would i begin  armor buid or contine with a (sorry for not knowing the term.) \"damage item\" \"AD\"/\"AP\" item.","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2017-03-06T22:00:16.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not super familiar with the various top lane match ups, but often if you get behind, falling back on full tank items is a good plan to stop things from snowballing, plus tanks can pretty much always be useful in teamfights as meatshields at the very least. Someone trying to continue to build damage when behind is still going to die super quickly, end up even more behind, and not be able to contribute much in fights.\n\nIt can in principle vary on the champ though. Some champs (for example, many adcs) are going to build the same 4-5 items even if they're behind, since late game AD damage is nearly their sole purpose. Other roles/champs might have more options to them, where their build when snowballing is going to be different from their build when going even, which is going to be different from their build when behind.\n\nI main sup/bot myself though, and also am not a pro. If you want to get a feel for dealing with camille, look up pro games with camille, and see how people are building against her, and compare to how they build those champs in other games.\n\nSomething I forgot to mention is earlier is to potentially look up a champ, figure out why their build is what it is, and then look for a different pro game on the same champ with a different build, and see if you can figure out why their build changed. Repeat until you've got more feel around the more situational items that a champ might build in certain situations.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hallbuster","date":"2017-03-06T03:04:48.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You buy the essential items first and then move onto the situational items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Grimspeake","date":"2017-03-06T02:37:51.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you try to build your champion to their strength and the other teams strengths. like if ur a xin zhao against a heavy ap comp, u want mr and something to compliment ur innate sustain so building a spirit visage would be good. its kinda hard to explain because its a very diverse thing and is super dependant on the situation. it mostly comes from experience and using ur best judgement.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-03-06T02:36:50.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I do is when the game is loading up I type my username in here: http://www.lolnexus.com\n\nThat will load up a page about your game, and at the top will be builds that higher rank people have recently used. You can click the arrows on the side to scroll through them if you don't like the first one, it also shows what runes they use, mastery spread, and what order they leveled their skills in.\n\nYou can also check the rune pages and such of your opponents. For example, when I am playing Talon I look for anyone who doesn't have the standard 9 armor seals to pick on early game.\n\nEDIT: Over time you will find out different things you can try for your character against certain champions. For example as Talon I would build hexdrinker if I was expecting a rough lane against a mage, but I wouldn't build it against a Zed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Micbran","date":"2017-03-06T02:30:00.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on the champion and the enemy comp.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PureSilvrr","date":"2017-03-06T02:28:34.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what champions do you play?","replies":[]}]}
