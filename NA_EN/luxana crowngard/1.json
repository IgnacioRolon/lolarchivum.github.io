{"poster":"Luxana Crowngard","date":"2017-11-08T17:01:37.535+0000","title":"Thanks Riot","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"You have murdered the one and only champion that I actually enjoyed playing this god-forsaken game with. Lux. Before the Runes Reforged, I was able to proc thunderlords with an ability and an auto attack, now I have to cast 2 of my 3 damaging abilities on a burst mage just to proc something that deals little to no damage with the current changes. While this is more like season 1 this gameplay update killed the only champion I like to play. \n\nStarting the game with no armor or magic resist, or no AP on Lux is beyond unimaginable. Her abilities DO NOT deal enough damage early in the game to be considered even a champion. She does cannon minion damage with her freaking Q and E as poke. Before this runes reforged non-sense, I could have some degree of survivability with the fact that I could format my runes with armor or MR as needed and still be able to do deal SOME form of damage to champions. Now I can barely hit 60 damage level 1, and her level 2 is not much more than just a hard CC 2 second root that you have to HOPE that either your ADC or jungler has SOMETHING in form of damage to effectively give you a lead so that you can make your way up to your items to be able to deal any damage at all.\n\nAnother note and I will reiterate the fact that Lux has a Champion is supposed to be a burst mage. She can&#039;t be a burst mage if you have no burst. Her burst does MAYBE 400 damage at BEST level 6 with the current changes. Before she could have dealt maybe 500~600 damage level 6. Taking away her identity as a burst mage not something you have intended to do, and not many people play Lux frequently. She&#039;s just outclassed by every other champion. Her damage is sub-par, she can&#039;t even waveclear properly come level 9 even after her first item, She&#039;s been dumped into the support role and even then she&#039;s not that good. There&#039;s no where left for Lux to go. At this point you could just delete the champion and nobody would even bother to give her a second thought.\n\nLux in the current state of affairs is just underwhelming. I&#039;m saying that nicely. She can not trade effectively anymore. Having to land 2 of your 3 damaging abilities for 0 pay off. \n\nHere are my suggestions. If you going to just leave her in the shit pile like a whole lot of other champions, just delete the champion. She cannot be played with these current changes. She&#039;s no longer a support. Just a walking minion with a 300g bounty on her head.\n\nBuff her base damages\n\nHer Q ability only deals 50~250 base damage based on level. 50 at level 1! with what 60% scaling? not hard to do math, with the current runes reforged you can get 40 AP level 1 if you are above 70% health. The only problem with that is that you have next to the lowest health pool in the entire game. You have the lowest armor rating in the entire game and possibly the worst armor scaling in the entire game. I mean hell you start with 19 armor for god sakes. by level 6 you have 36ish armor while everyone else has well over 45. Something needs to change in lux&#039;s base stats or something!\n\nIf you guys at the balance department aren&#039;t going to amp up her base stats then the least thing you can do is amp up her ability damage ratios or even just flat increase their damage.\n\nAs mentioned on her Q, It&#039;s base damage is 50 damage at level 1 scaling 50 base damage every level.\nIn order for her to be Some what viable I believe that if she had 15 damage increase on her Q to make it 65 base damage scaling with 50 base damage every level, she would be fantastic.\n\nHer W is mediocre but it atleast works. \n\nHer E, her only source of poke hardly does enough damage. let alone even wave clear with it. Minions are always living with a silly trimmed beard hair of health that it&#039;s just depressing. A mage that can&#039;t even wave clear? Wow. It&#039;s almost like every other mage can wave clear. Identity Crisis.\n\nHer basic abilities need revision is what I&#039;m trying to say here. Lux NEEDS to be looked at. She needs help. The only champion I love is being gutted by the runes update. She wasn&#039;t even that strong before this update, now she is just too weak to even play.\n{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[{"poster":"Aυtistic Sombra","date":"2017-11-08T18:18:57.115+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just after the first game in the preseason with Lux.\n\nI feel.. disappointed.\nIn twenty-fourth minute i couldn't clear mage minions with my e.\n\nComet is okay, but Lux really suffered from lack of ThunderLord's.\n\nWhat she needed most was mana regen AND cooldown reduction AND magic pen. \nGuess where I had it all?
