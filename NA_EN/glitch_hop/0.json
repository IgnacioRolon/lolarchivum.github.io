This happened to me a day ago while I was on my way back from vacation I got a call from a friend I play league with saying that he thought someone was on my account. So when I got home I logged on to see if any messages have been sent to him. By my surprise I saw that there were messages being sent to him which kinda spooked me out so what I did was change my password hoping that would help now I'm awaiting to see if he logs on to my account again.  P.s I have not given my password to anyone.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-06T21:49:35.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Finding someone else on your account can be scary, and I'm glad you've taken steps by changing your password.
