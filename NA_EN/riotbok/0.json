We've gone through all of the reports, though so far we haven't found any consistent pattern to the packet loss.\n\n>Since reports have started to slow down a bit, we're going to unsticky this thread, though we'll still have our eyes out for any future reports.  If you're still concerned about your own packet loss, we'd highly recommend that you [send us a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so that we can help to troubleshoot your connection.\n\n>Thanks again!\n\n------\n\n>EDIT: Added in another step about trying the troubleshooting steps first :3 Please try the steps first so that we can rule out local networking issues!  Helps a *lot* to speed up our investigations\n\n\nHey everyone,\n\nWe've been reviewing threads on packet loss for the past week or so and while we haven't been able to find anything confirming widespread issues as of yet, we wanted to create a mega-thread to make it easier for us to collect information. \n\nWith that said, here's how you can help.\n\n1. Confirm that you're experiencing packet loss by uploading your [network logs](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq4) into our [Log Reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader)\n\n2. If you are experiencing packet loss (should look something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/L0d3uWf.jpg) if you are), first attempt the resolution steps outlined in the KB article\n\n2.  If you tried the troubleshooting steps and are still getting frequent packet loss, let us know the following information:\n\n\n* Where you're playing from (City, State/Province)\n* Who's your ISP (Comcast, CenturyLink, Shaw, etc.)\n* [Trace route to game servers](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq2)","replies":[{"poster":"Kazulu Cthulhu","date":"2016-06-08T04:31:29.608+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can we get an update on what's going on?

It's happened in some of my games, where I just can't move and everything around my continues as normal. Disconnecting and then reconnecting always fixes the issue, though that's a pretty annoying solution. There's really no indication of when it will happen, because everything is totally normal until the random spike.

If I&#x27;m understanding your concern correctly, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more indicative of routing changes or changes along your route.\n> \n> I wouldn&#x27;t be super concerned  at a 10ms change, but if you notice further increases, I&#x27;d recommend [sending us a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for one of our tech specialists to review your connection.\n\nHave confirmed that other Rogers users in Ontario Canada also have a ping increase.\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/GD/NHAkN3UO-rogers-fibreop-ping\n\nIs there anything you guys at Riot can do to get Rogers to fix their routing issues? I haven't paid my bill, so I can't call and complain (I will automatically get transferred to billing/collections when I call them).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"beanz419","date":"2016-06-10T20:10:09.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive been having the packet loss issues for past week even made a post the other day but no replies and here is the log reader for me\nhttp://i.imgur.com/65IrdPi.png?1\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/6HIVCFZ.png?1\n\nand then today i contacted my isp and they looked into everything and said my internet was having no problems they even looked for packet loss on my end and said there was none and the lady said she tried a few settings and first game after i got done talking to them the lag was still there and heres the log reader\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/bJQ3e7U.png?1\n\nlive in Ohio...

When I wasn't on the rift my internet was fine. My ping would spike to 500+ms then my internet would go out. Then reconnect for a few minutes then go out again. This only happened during that rift match. My internet is stable for all other aspects of my web romps. Not sure if this is related, or if League is overloading the network somehow.\n\nEDIT: I normally don't have this issue. This was the first occurrence of this situation I have experienced.\n\nEDIT II: I have submitted a ticket with the appropriate files attached~\n\nEDIT III: Regardless of the connection issues, I was still able to preform well, however I was \"Attempting to Reconnect\" during the time the enemy team surrendered so the game had ended before the connection became stable again.","replies":[]}]}
