From current reports this seems to be specific to players with Spectrum as their ISP.  The team is currently investigating to determine whether or not this issue stems from a broader Spectrum outage or an error in our network.\n\nIf you're experiencing this issue, if you could provide the following information, that would help out!\n\n**CITY, STATE**:\n**INTERNET PROVIDER:**\n\n> UPDATE 2:55 PM PST\n\n\n> Broporo Here! I'm getting word that these login issues *should* be resolved at this point. If you still are unable to get passed \"Authenticating\" please let me know in a comment below.","replies":[{"poster":"Annielyzer","date":"2017-10-05T22:15:22.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey i have a bit different question. Sometimes (Like every 15-20th game) I get a random 500 ping in the game with the \"attempting to reconnect\"-alert. I restart the client and cant connect into the game anymore. Sometimes i can't even login anymore. What can i do to stop this? Sometimes i can't connect for like 5-10 minutes and sometimes when i connect enemies are in our base (literally happened 3 times now). It's not that disturbing since you climb anyway if you would, but it's annoying for me and ofc my teammates... I don't know how often i got reported for that, when i can't do anything about it","replies":[]},{"poster":"LocatedEagle232","date":"2017-10-05T21:41:53.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only had the issue for about 3 minutes, about 30 seconds after an 'invisible' patch was installed, it allowed me to log in normally.","replies":[]}]}
