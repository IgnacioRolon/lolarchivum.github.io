New games seem to be completing properly), but the team is still working to figure out why we saw a sudden increase earlier this morning/afternoon.  Root cause still unknown.\n\n------------------------------\n\n>#Update 2:14 PM\n\n>The team is still triaging and investigating.  We're still working on identifying potential root causes.  Ghost games are fairly difficult to track in general and it's especially difficult to determine whether or not multiple instances of ghost games are related to the same root cause or just coincidentally happening at the same time.\n\n>We've looped in a few more teams, so I'm hoping for a more meaningful update soon.\n\n------------------------------\n\nHey everyone,\n\nSeeing quite a few players reporting that they're stuck in games after they've finished (\"ghost games\").  We're taking a look and investigating what might be causing this to flare up again.  Ghost games can happen every once in a while, but it's definitely a bit unusual for so many players to be affected at the same time.\n\nWill keep this thread updated with any new information!","replies":[{"poster":"lit taco","date":"2017-09-21T19:58:25.911+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Been stuck for 2 hours already.......

I found posts reporting this issue dated all the way back in 2013, why does it take a company, like riot, to fix or restructure the game around this bug to avoid it in the future ?  All i can find is excuses and rationale as to why this bug is happening followed by \"We're working on resolving this issue\", really ? Doesn't look like you've resolved it.\n\nJust like how your time is viable, ours, as players, is too.

What's happening is that the message from the game server telling your client you're ready for another game gets lost, so your client thinks you're trying to reconnect to a game that doesn't exist anymore.\n\nFor the games, I hear you.  It should hopefully be far less than 3 hours, that's just the maximum amount of time. We're still working to see why more players than usual might be getting stuck.
