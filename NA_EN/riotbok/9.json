Happy gaming everyone!\n---\n\n>**EDIT:** After conversations with the team, it looks like March 8 will also include maintenance involving some core systems so we're extending this notice to continue through March 8.  Maintenance windows stay the same (6am-12pm PST).  Title has also been updated to reflect the additional maintenance day.\n---\n\nHey everyone!\n\nHeads up on maintenance happening within our datacenters from ~6am-12pm PST on March 5, March, 6, and March 7 that could affect the NA and OCE servers.  Since we&#039;re doing testing on redundant systems, we&#039;re hopeful that gameplay won&#039;t be impacted, though we&#039;ll be keeping a careful eye on player impact during the maintenance windows.  If all goes well, no one will even notice it ever happened \\o/\n\nFor any changes, stay tuned to the [Service Status Page](http://riot.com/2oBArbE)\n\nCheers!","replies":[{"poster":"Jhobi","date":"2018-03-05T03:09:34.146+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hope it goes well!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sex Crazed Eve","date":"2018-03-05T02:40:09.575+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"tell stashu I want him as my bf","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vaati","date":"2018-03-07T15:39:36.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This maintenance this morning installed like 5gb of something, which is an insane amount of something to be installing with no patch notes.

I believe the patch size should be somewhere around 1.5GB for this patch.  The number you're seeing is normally bigger than the actual download size as it includes some amount of processing/non-network kinda stuff like applying the patches, but since this patch is much bigger than normal, it kind of ballooned the listed number.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2018-03-05T19:56:17.400+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"We have a live incident breakdown section on the boards?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2018-03-05T22:45:27.527+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a hidden section that we keep pretty restricted to announcements/statements of this nature.
