On Wednesday, July 19th we&rsquo;re going to turn ranked off at 1:30am PDT and then from around 3am PDT till 8am PDT perform some proactive software upgrades to our network routers. As with any software upgrade, this will add various software optimizations, enhancements, etc. to make it easier to support and maintain the routers in the pursuit of keeping a stable service.  \n\nWhile everything sounds good so far, there is a slight catch:  updating routers means that some players might be bumped on their current path to our servers and re-routed, which might cause some brief disconnects (Which is why we&rsquo;re disabling ranked, just in case).  We&rsquo;ll keep a close eye on the maintenance, and if things get too out of hand, we&rsquo;ll react quickly.\n\nWe will make sure to update this thread with any updates on the maintenance or when it&rsquo;s completed!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-19T15:50:58.467+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys,\n\nIt looks liked Ranked is back up!

Depends on what you're dodging,  things like lux's R are dodge able and zacs dumb dive  skill. Maybe there's some situations Idk.  \n200ms is big on certain games  like MMORPGs,  Suprisingly on LoL it isn't that noticeable. The game is pretty playable with 200ms in my experiences...it only starts getting bad when you go into the 300s, 400ms+ is just unplayable. Everything from last hitting to movement feels pretty smooth.  But as I can imagine some tricks would be harder to pull off. \n\n\n\nTl;DR\n\nThe game is playable at 200 but of course it would probably feel clunky if you're used to playing at a 64-100 range.","replies":[{"poster":"DeadUnborn","date":"2017-07-19T17:56:28.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm..hahaha take into account that if you are playing at 200 everyone will react faster than you do.
