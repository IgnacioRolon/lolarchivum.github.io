Please forgive me.\n\nMy idea was to add descriptions to summoner icons, so people actually know what they mean. Sometimes I see icons of other people or own icons and I don't know how they or I got them. It would be nice to have a description of sorts, see attached images.\n\nWhile this feature might just look like a gimmick, I think it would add a nice level of transparency. It also makes icons more worthy to strive for as the option to see what it was rewarded for allows people to show off, as it adds extra value and weight to the individual icons.\n\nThe first two images are examples when choosing a summoner icon. The third one is an idea that when you are in the loading screen, you can hover over a players summoner icon to see what it was rewarded for.\n\nEDIT: Also an important point is that icons have evolved to League of Legends own little achievement system to a certain degree. Thanks to kanacho for the comment.\n\nEDIT2: CaptainMårvelous had the idea to add flavored text, this I added a 4th attachment *SummonerIconIdea04.png* as an example","replies":[{"poster":"Ø Flex","date":"2014-11-16T16:53:35.254+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's a good idea, although all of the descriptions on how to get each icon is fairly simple to find.","replies":[{"poster":"TheYellowpaper","date":"2014-11-16T17:09:34.025+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"You are right for most of the icons and also if you have played the game for a few years. But there are lots of new players that have never seen these icons before. Even I didn't know some icons existed and I've been playing this game for roughly 4 years. Just a few days ago I started playing Teambuilder for fun and started seeing icons I have never seen before. Those were Teambuilder specific icons.\n\nAt that time it would have been nice if I was able to just hover over the summoner icon in the loading screen and read a description, e.g. \"This icon is rewarded for 5 wins with a support in Teambuilder.\". And there is also the reasoning that some icons might be ugly but hard to achieve. Adding the description gives certain icons more value as said in my thread post and players might be more motivated to get icons as it is more than just the icon itself you get. It's like a trophy and the guarantee that other players can truely appreciate it. I hope I make sense. ._.\n\nBasically what I'm trying to say is that icons will be more desirable and valuable. It adds a similar feel to them like old legacy skins or generally skins that are not available anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"AbrakaDoodle","date":"2014-11-17T05:39:21.349+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Right, that could help the really bleak loading screen.

Runes are an important part of gameplay, so their descriptions are pretty much mandatory. The description for an icon that is not present at all during games is not.\n\nAs well, you're posting in the boards of the developer site. They're not found in game.
