Why not just mute? Try to take all ego out of it and just mute. You dont need to announce that youre ignoring someone, unless youre trying to send a message. So maybe they just feel offended by that message youre sending. Just mute, dont announce it. I know when I mute someone, I like to tell them theyre muted just to let em know I'm above them.  Luckily, its pretty rare that I feel the need to mute someone, and even more rare for them to troll because of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kyoyaoaaa","date":"2020-01-21T20:41:40.175+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"Lol \nPeople who publicly announce they muted someone are no better than your typical toxic asshats.","replies":[{"poster":"BoRnToKiLL666","date":"2020-01-21T20:47:23.758+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":10,"body":"how? im letting them know i cant hear them so dont bother trying to type or ping to me, thats courtesy.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2020-01-21T21:39:11.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Typically, it comes off as extremely dismissive.  \n\nYou can word it nicely like \"I'm gonna mute and focus\" and it won't sound as dismissive.
