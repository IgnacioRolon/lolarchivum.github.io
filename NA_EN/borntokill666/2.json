I  suppose it's possible that they were banned independent of my report, hard to say.\n\nMy point is, unless we're 100% confident that Riot exclusively bans boosted accounts in waves and won't miss any boosted players in such waves, we should still be reporting them if we have adequate reason to do so.\n\nEdit: And unless your standard of proof is unreasonably high, I would certainly say that many such forum smitings are \"definitive\". If a so-so player suddenly swaps flash keys and champs and goes 27/2/12 nineteen games in a row and goes up six divisions before swapping back and dipping again, there's really no other realistic explanation than boosting.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-02-28T03:35:34.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The standard of proof is evidence that the account was played on by two different humans.
