I was wondering how many of them will actually be attending and more specifically will any of the art team be there? I love meeting Rioters (Had a blast last year with some) but this year I would really love to meet some of the art team seeing I'm currently in school for game art and would love to pursue a career at Riot Games one day. I'd love to ask them questions and get an idea of what Riot expects from interns/employees from a person perspective.\r\n\r\nHope to see and hang with you guys at PAX!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-03-02T22:20:03.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll be there for fun (and cosplaying!)","replies":[{"poster":"Fallenone523","date":"2015-03-02T22:35:22.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh awesome! Who will you be going as? Maybe I'll see you!
