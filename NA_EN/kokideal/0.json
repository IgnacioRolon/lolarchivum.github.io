I was never banned for it because neither gave an advantage, it only changed skins.\n\nHowever, some programs may add features that CAN give you an unfair advantage. For example, back before we had timers, Curse(I think) was a bannable program due to it giving jungle timers which resulted in an unfair advantage against those not using Curse. As such, I believe Curse ended up removing the timers and then being allowed to be used.\n\n[This post by Wuks](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/5dmkJinG-3rd-party-applicationsmodifications-whats-allowed-and-what-isnt) explains what's allowed and what isn't, and which is a \"use-at-your-own-risk\" thing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2017-04-20T13:51:33.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think they'd care if you used it on the PBE server, but it does get around paying for skins.

They typically only do so if you are using them to give yourself and advantage though, personally before I downloaded anything I would make sure you researched the program in question very, very well. There are some custom skin programs that come installed with scripts and Riot will ban those on sight even if you don't use the scripts that are in them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daklore","date":"2017-04-19T17:18:13.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Possible, yes.
