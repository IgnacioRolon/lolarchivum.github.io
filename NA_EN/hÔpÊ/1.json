Played him several times on many accounts. Oneshotting people is way too easy. His early game sux and his late game is broken.\r\n\r\nBasically every champion feels super broken in good hands and adc doesn&#039;t exist xd They are the only lane than can go 20/0 and lose. Top is the best lane, bc brusers are broken. Jng is 2nd bc of stupid assassins like my Shaco, that can literally oneshot smb without any problem. 3rd is Supp bc they are usefull. 4th is Mid bc mages are weak but their items are strong. The last is ADC coz they are useless and worthless. \r\n\r\nI want Riot to start adressing the issues. Nerf overall dmg in the game. Rework ADC, they are completely destroyed. Rework my Shaco, he is only oneshotting, i want him to be an anoying trickster. Introduce new items for mages. Nerf DH. Nerf Gunsoo. Get rid of Duskblade. Get rid of Stormrazor. \r\n\r\nIf you adress issues and fix the game, then it would be ok. This patch overall wasn&#039;t bad. I like what you did to towers, bouties and minions. I just need more of that and less of brainless dmg. Burst dmg shouldn&#039;t be common, but situational. Burst champions should be able to kill a single person, but not a whole team. \r\n\r\nWith new DH i felt like i am not even a jungler anymore. I was just walking and killing everybody and ended up with 32 kills. It just doesn&#039;t feel right, even though it was fun. For me. Only for me. My team didn&#039;t have fun, bc they were unnecessary and unneeded, I would still win without them. The enemy team couldn&#039;t have fun, they were dead all the time. I didn&#039;t even have to farm anymore, after I hit 40 DH stacks I was just running and killing them for sport and they were too scared to even go to their own jng.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t even think that we need more defensive options. I think we need less dmg so that this clown fiesta can end.","replies":[{"poster":"HommeGoujon","date":"2018-11-21T16:49:53.726+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"Not a single issue from last season has been resolved\"\n\"This patch overall wasn't bad.

An addition isn't a solution. There was no issue that was conected with minions and bounties. Towers were too weak but they are still too weak. They just added plates, that disappear after some time and then the tower is even weaker than before lol. I have no problem with that for now. I want to see how it plays off. Maybe they will be too weak or maybe it will be ok.","replies":[{"poster":"HommeGoujon","date":"2018-11-21T18:37:55.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Towers deal way more dmg tbh and that was one of the issues with them. I think they should be harder to take down (I agree) but overall the problem was, it not solved, at least addressed. We were lacking some comeback mechanisms and so they \"addressed\" it with the minions/bounties changes. I still think it's going in the right direction.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"HÔPÊ","date":"2018-11-21T17:04:22.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Now people downvote but later they will say the same things as I do.
