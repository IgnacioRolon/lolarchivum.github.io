The reason your community is toxic at times is because you fail to simply look at these accounts being reported for trolling or AFKs especially. The attached link is one of many examples that still exist. \r\n\r\nThis is eventually going to noticeably catch up to Riot. You can not continue to leave your fan base hung out to dry. Players will (and already have) slowly removed themselves from the game because of the lawlessness and lack of punishment. People get mad because the people they are mad at are constantly getting away with AFK or troll activities.\r\n\r\nIf you fail to add manual intervention it will hurt the long term growth of the game. I hate to be negative without suggesting solutions so here are a few:\r\n\r\n-If someone AFKs or clearly trolls or is toxic first punishment should be a short-term ranked ban. Maybe 7-10 days\r\n-AFK players should lose 50 LP for a DC when their team loses\r\n-Have someone at riot look at the most reported players manually and issue unique punishments if multiple infractions occur\r\n\r\nI had TWO afk players in games yesterday. Not sure why I am surprised. Maybe others can come up with better punishments because a low priority queue does nothing to some of these people. Hopefully this post helps spark some ideas to make things better...\r\nAlso, there are plenty other videos and accounts like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kC_25aYOksU","replies":[{"poster":"SamaHamra","date":"2019-01-31T02:02:12.973+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If so It might lead to a lot of messed up things, they need to fix their client first. people are getting kicked out of games left and right, imagine your client crashing and getting punished severely for it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Applesaucey","date":"2019-01-31T02:33:47.875+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"They are too busy perma-banning people for chat offenses over nonsense things like calling another player a loser.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KentaToxic","date":"2019-01-31T02:09:23.053+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"It's not under the radar riot just doesn't care.
