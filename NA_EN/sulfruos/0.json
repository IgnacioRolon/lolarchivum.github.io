What should I do?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On Monday, I was sitting on 870 RP left over from a gift card. I didn't touch my account until Friday night. When I logged back on, I noticed I now have 1265 RP, meaning I somehow gained 395. No special notification that I know of came up, so what should I do? Was I hacked, was there a flaw in the system, and should I even touch my RP right now?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-22T02:26:51.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No hacks, and you're free to spend that RP fam! \n\nAs it turns out, we launched a sale that wasn't announced 2 weeks in advance.
