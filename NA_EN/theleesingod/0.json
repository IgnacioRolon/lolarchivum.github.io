ANY FEEDBACK GREATLY APPRECIATED!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it possible that my account got hacked? So my account has been ''hacked'' for a while and I have not been able to get back on my account since April. I sent riot a support ticket and they told me to answer they're questions like what was the last thing you bought with rp , ip and I couldn't remember anything, because like I said I have not been able to get on since April I also did not expect such an event to happen and was completely shocked when it did. But the weirdest thing is that nobody has played on it since, so is it possible that I changed my password and didn't know it? Any help will be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-06T22:55:49.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Submitting a ticket to our account team is your best bet to help with your specific issue.  Answering those questions helps to verify ownership of the account and assist with recovery as well as updating your information.  If the [account recovery](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751694-Recovering-Your-Account) page doesn't help with manually regaining access, then reach out again in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).  Good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"TheLeeSinGod","date":"2016-12-07T02:12:53.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the advice, but when I answered the questions to my best ability they still said that the information I gave to them was insufficient and did not prove my ''ownership'' to my account. It's really hard to remember what the first 6300 champion was that you bought or the birth date of the account when you've been playing league since start of season 2 . I don't know what to do anymore and I'm starting to lose any chance of getting my account back. Please if there is anything else I can do please contact me on this board ASAP. Thank You for your feedback. :D","replies":[{"poster":"BewareTheIdes","date":"2016-12-07T14:41:09.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have lived in the same residence since then you can actually tell them your current ip (you can do this through console commands or just go to a website like https://whatismyipaddress.com/) If you address of residence or ISP(internet service provider) has changed however this will not be possible. \n\nIf the Ip matches with the one they have you on file for using repeatedly to log into the client then that should serve as sufficient proof (though i'm not sure if they will accept only that) and you might also try name as many specifics about the account as possible . This helps them in confirming ownership.  Also this is why it is a good idea to keep your email updated. If you haven't tried through the email then I would also recommend this. If the email has changed for some reason then tell them the email you use to have so you can further proof ownership.  They should keep logs of all the email accounts you have used. \n\nIf you do still have the email account then https://account.leagueoflegends.com/na/en/forgot-password\n\nuse that to reset the password and I don't think you need riot support's help to do so, I could be wrong since maybe the policy has changed but if you have the email then you should be able to easily change the pass. Same goes for if you forgot the username of the account. \n\nBest of luck to you in your quest to retrieve the holy account, watch out for rabbits on the way. And if you don't get it back then\n\nhttp://giphy.com/gifs/hurt-monty-python-VYcRNU4P3vyM\n\n\n\n\nAlso little psa, don't talk to rioters directly they can and will use their influence to get you banned if you have a problem with what you said. So step on eggshells or don't talk to them. Heck some of them like Riot Tantram and previously Riot Lyte have been know to lead witch hunts against people by using private information against them to manipulate the discussion. I also know some people have been banned in game with strange circumstances when involved in talking on the boards to rioters. They will flag your account for anything that they can ban it for and can actually put ban preferences on your account. So you are more likely to be banned if you do something to anger a rioter like tantram that already works on the instant feedback and punishment team.\n\nSo be careful when talking to rioters they are not our friends, they are employees that are here to maintain a public image and nothing more.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
