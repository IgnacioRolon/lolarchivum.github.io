She can launch both clients without issues, queue for games, and go through champion select without any issues, but one champ select ends and the actual game launches, she immediately gets a black screen which then closes itself, followed by a bug splat report. She can then bring league back up and is faced with the reconnect button, but clicking that will only start the same process over indefinitely. \r\n\r\nShe has reinstalled the game twice now, and has reinstalled her operating system, but all to no avail. She's also been placed in low priority queues because of this and is worried that her continuous effort to play will eventually result in a ban. The game loads custom matches just fine so the only way she can test is is by queuing into real games with other players (co-op vs AI beginner is a safe bet because her team won't get screwed over, but it still counts as afking). \r\n\r\nShes sent multiple bug reports her on the site, and has also opened 2 tickets (the original dating back about 3 weeks now) that have yet to be responded to. \r\n\r\nIf anyone has any insight on the issue, your help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-31T02:06:27.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since your friend is seeing the Bug Splat error where she can send a report, I'd suggest checking out our [**Bug Splat Guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974#section-mac) for some potential fixes. This might be an issue where their admin settings are conflicting with league whenever they try to play normal matches.\n\nIf your friend already has a ticket open, it would be best to wait for their reply, since our tech guys will be able to go much more in depth. If they haven't gotten a reply yet, shoot me that ticket number and I'd be more than happy to check up on that!\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]}
