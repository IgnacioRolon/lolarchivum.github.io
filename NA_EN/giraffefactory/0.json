So recently I've been lucky enough to have an extra monitor that my brother no longer has use for so I hooked it up to the laptop I play league on. So now I have dual screens. The only problem is, when I get into a game of LoL, part of the in-game screen gets clipped off at the edges. So for example, if I click on enemy Nasus, in the upper left hand corner where it shows you the basic overview of the enemy, I can see the items he's bought, but it clips off his icon. Hopefully that makes sense. But I'm just having issues trying to solve the clipping error.\r\n\r\nAny help would be much appreciated, thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-12T20:52:31.971+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you using 4K?
