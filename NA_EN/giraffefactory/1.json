In every game I've played, there are moments where I suddenly disconnect and/or lag for anywhere between 5-15 seconds. This has never happened to me prior to this patch nor is it happening to me in any other online games (Overwatch, for example, is perfectly fine). Everyone else is experiencing FPS drops it seems, which I am too, but I haven't seen anybody else with complaints about the connection issues I'm having. \r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated, thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-11-16T02:37:31.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, sorry on the delayed response for this! x_X Been a bit flooded lately. Sad to hear that you're all experiencing the same issue.\n\nSince it seems to be something you're all experiencing, one potential common issue that can decrease FPS can be chocked up to the recent Windows 10 update. If you're on Win10, make sure that the update didn't re enable the Game DVR bar on your computer. Same goes for all your friends!\n\nI can also suggest you all try some more preliminary troubleshooting for FPS drops with [**these steps here**](http://riot.com/2dlHSAF) if you've made sure the DVR isn't on or if you guys don't have it on your devices.
