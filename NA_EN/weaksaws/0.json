It's my main account and have always been a very positive player. Many years ago, I received the Santa Baron Nashor Summoner's Icon. I've used the icon for awhile now. After logging in to my account, I noticed that my icon was black. When going to my Summoner's Icon section, the space where my Baron Nashor Santa Icon should be is blank, and the other Urf Christmas, and Wreath with Swords Icons are still there. It's apparent the Icon is just Missing or was removed by a bug? Because there's a huge gap in that spot now. My question is this: Is it possible this is a glitch from a patch? Or was my Summoners Icon Removed for some reason unknown to me? Is there any way to get specifically my Santa Baron Nashor Summoner Icon back? \n\nAny response from a moderator/admin would be much appreciated.\n\n\nUpdate: So apparently in lobby, and queue, the picture for the icon no longer appears on my client. But to others, if I choose the icons blank spot, it populates my summoner icon area with a blank or missing picture.. Where they say they can see the image of Santa Baron Nashor, but my client shows nothing. If this is a confirmed Client issue, how should I resolve it?

It sounds to me like some game files may have gone corrupt or failing to render assets, so it's not able to show images.
