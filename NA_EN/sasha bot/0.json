As long as you have one of your 3 allotted refund tokens and within 90 days then you can manually refund your content through the store.  More details are also available in our [refund guidelines](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751864-Content-Refund-FAQ).  If you have no tokens left, there might not be anything we can do.  I can't make any guarantees, but you can hit us up in a ticket and we can look for possibilities.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Sasha Bot","date":"2016-11-12T01:06:32.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much Porocles!!!!!","replies":[]}]}]}
