I instantly turned it back on and rejoined the game. The disconnect didn't even last longer than Baron buff. I got back into the game and my team and I swiftly ended the game afterwards. When I got to the post game screen Leaverbuster popped up and put me in a low priority queue with 20 minute wait. I do believe this was the first dc on my account in a quite a long time. I don't understand how I got punished for 3-4 minutes afk, coming back, winning, and not having previous afk games or low priority queues. PLEASE HELP RITO\r\n\r\nWhen you go into leaverbuster FAQ, it states it punishes afk's that occur more than once. I had 1 disconnect, and reconnected, and got punished. With no previous leaver buster issues in months, I also got the 20 minute punish. Now I submitted a ticket to Riot's support about it and the ticket has yet to even be assigned to a Riot employee let alone been responded to. Can someone explain this to me?","replies":[{"poster":"FanaticDudezzz","date":"2017-09-24T13:32:24.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i got disconnected and the router needed 10 minutes to return....and i took leaverbuster for 20 mins (for the rest of leaves i have no excuses) but i could not do anything (sorry for my bad english {{champion:32}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lavrence","date":"2017-05-21T00:43:25.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"low priority queue is a really bad name for it seeing as the word priority would assume you could be pulled out if needed which I don't think you can. Its more of Time out Queues that locks your client from doing anything including spending money. Which is just silly and doesn't do much of anything.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-21T00:00:20.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh man, that really really sucks that your pc shutoff during a match. It happens to the best of us. I went ahead and pulled up your match history, and it doesn't look like you have a big history of purposefully leaving games, which is definitely good!\n\nI have your ticket pulled up, and noticed that you are responding before anyone replies to your ticket. One reason it's taking so long is because every time you submit another response, it will bump your ticket back in line. Be patient with those agents, and there's a chance that we might be able to help out in your ticket!","replies":[{"poster":"FallingSkywards","date":"2017-05-21T00:40:10.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thanks man. much appreciated. I sent that response right after this post too. I'm done with the low priority queues now but want to bring it to Riot's attention if it is a mistake or something.","replies":[]}]}]}
