Not feeling more ready to behave better cuz I got my own code that supercedes your summoner's code: you earn respect with good plays or gameplay common sense. And there's  a lot of lack that it kinda adds up. I have zero plan of going pro in LoL. Only thing that addicted me to LoL now was the goal of getting better tier such as getting Diamond. And it's pretty obvious that over 80 percent of toxicity comes from chat alone. Only that. Add the option of turning entire thing off already. Four years and you still can't tack on this extremely simple fact... you are losing more of my respect each year. And I am not up to improving my behavior for this game. Plus I am going into college so I will be giving up on LoL soon. All stuffs that attracted me before first season were completely gone now. It's all cold money now. Only thing that LoL can excite me is the goal of reaching better tier.  To tell you the truth, LoL is getting more boring despite new graphics and stuffs.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-02-10T05:55:24.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can turn the chat off. It's called putting everyone on ignore at the start of the game, then removing the ones who did well so you get paired with them and not the ones that sucked. :3 L2P n00bl0rd","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sailor Mint","date":"2015-02-10T05:44:34.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the threat of losing your account isn't enough, I don't know what to tell you.

Heathstone won't be enough.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GaleWinUnleashed","date":"2015-02-10T05:38:18.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can drag the chat box off-screen if you like.
