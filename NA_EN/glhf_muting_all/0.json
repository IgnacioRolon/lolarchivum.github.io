Sylas was saying that he stole Yasuo's ult but he couldn't use it or get rid of it. I haven't played him but is there a timer on how long the ult is kept? Or is it there until you use it?\r\n\r\nI only ask because no one on our team had a knock up so literally, he couldn't use it xD (Not to sound mean haha)\r\n\r\nIf that is the case I think they should fix that or do something about it because that would be very frustrating IMO.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"Lrrr Omicronian","date":"2019-06-17T01:04:30.883+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say that part of playing Sylas is knowing which Ults to steal.\n\nThere did used to be a keystone \"Courage of the Colossus\", and it was part of playing the game, to know if you could proc it or not before equipping it into a match.
