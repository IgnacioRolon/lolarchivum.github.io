Seriously, just let us know you are aware of this issue, I dont care if you can fix it or not yet. JUST. FUCKING. COMMUNICATE. WITH YOUR AUDIENCE.\r\n\r\nAs for the bug. Game freezes in early game, usually resulting in a forced application close from task manager. Same as everyone elses problem.\r\n\r\nIDK Why there isnt a big frontpage post on Reddit yet.
