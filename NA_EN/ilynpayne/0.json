And I am assuming it is X since I do it sometimes to click on small Krugs.\r\n\r\nBut it is hard to use since it is not on a smartcast mode. \r\n\r\nHow can I do that to easily move and AA with having tons of attack speed, and use it efficiently?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-21T03:31:01.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm I think you might be seeing people use the Attack-Move command. You should be able to hit \"a\" by default and left click in order to move towards that location while attacking anything in the way.","replies":[{"poster":"IlynPayne","date":"2017-07-21T04:52:33.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"does that give priority to Champions if there are minions in the way?","replies":[{"poster":"EvilMerodach","date":"2017-07-21T16:05:41.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fairly sure attack-move will always just attack the nearest \"enemy\" target within your attack range while also inside your movement path.\nSo, no, won't prioritize.","replies":[{"poster":"IlynPayne","date":"2017-07-21T21:56:09.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks alot guys.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-21T21:10:23.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"EvilMerodach is correct here, attack-move will target minions first if there are any in the way.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
