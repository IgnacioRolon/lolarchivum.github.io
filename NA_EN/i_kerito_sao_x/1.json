You'll just have to bookmark the [News](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/) page for updates, and try not to shake too much.

Sadly their ways prolly cost them some sales as I can personally say the new cait skin and the khazix skin would have been purchased by me day 1 if they brought it out on time. \nSadly they didnt so I just poured my funds into players unknown battlegrounds. Dont worry one day Riot will get it together and release content in a more timely manner ... until then its hurting no one but themselves. All you need to do is just be patient or spend your money elsewhere since they cannot release their content in a timely manner. Speak with your wallet is what I always say.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alliey123","date":"2017-06-14T19:18:42.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I saw them not in the shop but under skins tab when u click on the champions but i dont know how to get them...","replies":[{"poster":"I KeRiTo SAO X","date":"2017-06-14T19:20:58.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i know i have seen them too\nbut you can't  buy them \nthats what i am asking when will they be available ;-;","replies":[{"poster":"LabMonkeyForDuty","date":"2017-06-14T20:01:24.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When a new skin comes out, they usually wait a couple days to actually release the skin.
