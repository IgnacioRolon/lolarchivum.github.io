If anyone would post a song or two for up to their top 3 favorites, that&#039;d be cool. I&#039;m thinking it would be fun to share some favorite songs for certain champs.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot TreblMuffin","date":"2018-01-03T22:10:03.871+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Braum. I've always liked the idea of Atlas Hands by Benjamin Francis Leftwich for him. \n\nI can imagine him trekking across the Freljord, covering up against the cold, trying to do the best he can for the people he meets, dedicated to fighting the battles they can't fight. He smiles for them, he laughs that old Braum laugh, but when he moves on, when the last village falls behind the last rise, he's alone. Nothing feels quite as good as home, and he misses it. And he misses _her._\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pyue2N1XZ0M","replies":[]},{"poster":"AquariuSol","date":"2018-01-06T17:10:46.377+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aLyiI2odhU\n\n{{champion:134}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2018-01-02T17:16:25.481+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:80}} https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5aZJBLAu1E\n\nAnd not for playing a champion.
