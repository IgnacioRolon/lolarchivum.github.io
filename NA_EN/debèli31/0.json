When I started it, my internet speed was horrible, and I had like 20-25 kbps with usual \r\n6 mbps, and I updated some games on Steam with 6 mbps as usual. This patch eventually completed after 50 minutes. My ping in-game is also very strange these days. Can someone help me?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-10T19:14:28.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless something is downloading in your background, your connection could be degrading and may just need some tuning up.
