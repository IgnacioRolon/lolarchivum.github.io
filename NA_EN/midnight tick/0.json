It's one of the worst, game-changing bugs I've ever faced. I have already tried reporting it to Riot's forums but I'm from LAS which makes it essentially terrible to head to.\r\nHere's two videos I've taken from someone's topic from like 20 days ago which is literally the same thing.\r\nhttp://plays.tv/video/57e6e91470a44e1a48/good\r\nhttp://plays.tv/video/5805321324b033caf0/rofl\r\n(These are videos from someone else)\r\n\r\nMy computer is absolutely fine, I've done repair, reinstall to League and updated my drivers. This is a thing after like, two patches or three. I feel like it's an issue that happened from the attempt to fix the screen freezes whenever Ryze's R appears or when Jayce's stuff appears, but now it's random and for everything.\r\nTo mention further more, the audio immediately gets muted and things like VO's from champions get silenced until finally recovering after the freeze. Many of my friends reported it and told me about it as well, which is godawful to hear because the freezes are **so **gamechanging.\r\n\r\nPlease, Riot. Please. Look into this. This is **not** an issue from our side, but the game's side.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-08T23:23:03.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The behavior in the videos you linked above are pretty common with system driver or hardware issues.
