I then have to end the lolclient process in the task manager and try again. I was trying to find a fix and found that people had had similar problems with razer products so i tried again after closing synapse and changing my keyboard and mouse and it worked fine. Does anyone have a solution so i don't have to change keyboard and mouse every time i play league?\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-27T17:22:30.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't heard of issues with razer products, and the I can't imagine any settings that would cause the issue you're having.  Your specific issue sounds like a setting with your OS or security feature that's blocking the client from launching.
