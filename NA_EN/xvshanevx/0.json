I currently have ~6000 ip to spend, and was thinking of getting {{champion:58}} for the safe early game. But over the week, when {{champion:92}} was free, I played her in a couple of bot matches and I found her extremely fun to play. But this was in bot matches, and I've heard of the high skill cap needed for her, which might make her more of a problem for me seeing I have little experience in top lane and my only top lane champs I have are {{champion:36}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:23}} and {{champion:102}}. \r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n\r\ntl;dr: I suck at top, need a fun or easy champ when I get stuck there.","replies":[{"poster":"Leti the Yeti","date":"2015-03-16T23:28:01.950+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"isnt she on free rotation like right now untill tonight?\njust go play her","replies":[{"poster":"xvshanevx","date":"2015-03-17T02:42:40.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LeagueSrsBsns,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=5WErrEUG,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2015-03-16T23:28:01.950+0000)\n>\n> isnt she on free rotation like right now untill tonight?\n> just go play her\n\nYa. I ran her about 5-6 times in Int Bot, but we know how hard bots are, especially if they can't script skill shots. But I was asking, see I tried her and like her in a bot match, if its worth the 4800 to pick her up. The thing is, I suck at top lane, don't know what to do half the time, don't know the match ups, etc. and was wondering if picking her up would cause more problems than create opportunities.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Graidon,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=5WErrEUG,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-03-16T22:35:32.573+0000)\n>\n> 1.

So add in Maokai with Riven and you'll be set on two great top lane choices that fill different needs depending on whether damage or tankiness is what your team will need.\n\nAlso, yaaaaa, in the games I played, the AA after each skill didn't seem like an issue, and the dash and stun seemed really solid. I had fun with her in bots, worried that even if I bring her to Norms I will still get stomped. Ugh. Anyways, someone else mentioned {{champion:57}} so I might pick him up. He can jungle too, right?\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Seattle Scrub,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=5WErrEUG,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-03-16T21:43:10.325+0000)\n>\n> What elo are you in?

Haven't placed this season yet due to not knowing how the Jungle works (still practicing that). I have all those champs you mentioned except {{champion:58}} and I was also thinking of getting him. I don't have any RP atm, so I am stuck with the 7k IP i do have, which is why I am making this such an issue XD. \n\n> [{quoted}](name=Mezzie,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=5WErrEUG,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-03-16T20:56:48.424+0000)\n>\n> If you are looking for easy, absolutely do NOT go Riven.

I think why I liked her was because of her difficulty, yet how smooth she felt with Smart-cast as compared to other champs (Thresh, I'm looking at you!!).

Ill check this out for sure :D and I diffidently thought of getting {{champion:126}}  too; he seems really powerful and fun to play, but I haven't seen him too much recently. And {{champion:127}} is a good solo-que top laner? Also, whats you thoughts on {{champion:59}} for top/jungle? Was thinking also of getting him as well.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=BlackMageTactics,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=5WErrEUG,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-03-16T19:59:14.538+0000)\n>\n> Don't pick up riven for pvp matches as something casual to do when you get the role, despite all everyone's whining she actually has a pretty high amount of mechanical ability and matchup knowledge required to even do decent with her - and the amount of skill and knowledge to play her only gets higher as you face better players since she is required to outplay the enemy to do her job and merely farming evenly is a failure.

Any thoughts on a good pocket-champ for top lane? As showed above, I am also thinking of picking up (as an alternative to Riven) {{champion:59}} I got this tier list, but so many champs I don't own XD\n\nAlso, {{champion:122}} and {{champion:105}} are free this week, so I'm a try them out too.","replies":[{"poster":"PÃ¦an","date":"2015-03-16T20:16:21.355+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to play Jayce in top and mid lane and I did really well, I dont know why I stopped.  His E-Q combo is so gratifying when you snipe someone for the kill.  Be sure to fire the Q off first then instantly drop the gate in it's path so the enemy has less time to react. The combo in cannon is Q-E not E-Q.  Also be sure to make use of his many passives.    For the longest time i didnt know his W passive in hammer form regained mana each strike.\n\nLissandra got a slight nerf to her Q damage due to high wave-clear (or maybe it's still pbe? not sure).  I started playing her toplane and have a 100% winrate, granted that was only 4 games, but I had literally just started playing her straight to ranked.  Her ult is a crazy targeted stun with some nice AOE damage.  She counters a lot of melee toplaners due to her slow on Q, root on W if they engage, and easy escape on E\n\nJarvan is pretty strong as a jungler/toplaner.  His innate tankiness is crazy and his passive still allows him to due a big chunk of damage even when build full tank.  He was nerfed a little with the armor gain on his flag, but that's normal for people that are pick-ban for a while.  Mechanically he is extremely simple, just toss the flag behind them and push Q, quick knock-up that the jungler/laner can follow up on.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Sword Saint","date":"2015-03-16T19:59:14.538+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't pick up riven for pvp matches as something casual to do when you get the role, despite all everyone's whining she actually has a pretty high amount of mechanical ability and matchup knowledge required to even do decent with her - and the amount of skill and knowledge to play her only gets higher as you face better players since she is required to outplay the enemy to do her job and merely farming evenly is a failure.
