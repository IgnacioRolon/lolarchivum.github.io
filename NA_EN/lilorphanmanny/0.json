I thought you were talking about Old Yordles in a literal sense. . .\n\nNow that you brought up the subject, I was thinking of giving {{champion:42}} an ability overhaul as well just so his kit would fit in to the whole Dog Fighting theme. When I think of dog fights, I think of planes trying to tail each other, firing their guns and missiles at their enemies. So perhaps some kind of passive or ability where Corki tails an opponent and fires all his guns at his opponent simultaneously.\n\nThat idea can be reserved for another dog fighting champion as well. Speaking of which, I'd like a new set of pilot champions who are all part of the Screaming Yipsnakes as a way to explore Corki's lore on his flight background. The many missions he's participated in, and some of his most daring and most dangerous battles. I mean Piltover as far as I can see is the only city with flying machines so its most likely Corki has fought against flying monsters throughout his career and is damn good at it too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Milky Thighs","date":"2018-12-29T03:40:25.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love Lulu, but I wish they'd make her look more akin to Poppy and Tristana.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hammermancer","date":"2018-12-29T03:40:00.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I kinda want yordels to live all over the place outside of piltover and make it the case that when yordels and humans coexist they start making science\n\ni mean I'm stoned so that might be stupid af\n\nbut like, it'd allow more interaction between champs like {{champion:74}} and {{champion:18}}  as well as a crossover as the Evil Archmage {{champion:45}} attacks piltover and threatains it's very future, {{champion:126}} comes to fight for the sake of tomorrow.
