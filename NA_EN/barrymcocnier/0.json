I know that might sound very sarcastic, but its the truth.\n\n I am currently in the bronze division, and I watched some of my replays to help improve, and I noticed how many times we simply fight for absolutely NO REASON. Even after we fight and one of the teams have been aced, we simply go back to base and get more items. For what? We already killed them? Why do we have to prove we can do it (or worse NOT do it) again? \n\nI have watched some higher elo games and in some games they dont get first blood until 20 minutes in. 20 MINUTES IN A GAME FOR ONE KILL. After 20 minutes in a bronze game its 49 to 54 and the jungler hasn't even looked at a single drag. \n\nSo I started paying attention and choosing battles when they are in my favor, and believe it or not I win more fights than i lose. Even when I am in a lane where I have been counter picked, as long as I don't feed the enemy and let them snowball, I AM WINNING MY LANE (of course cs is important too). \n\nSo when you look top and notice the 0/9 darius on your team, you simply can't stop the 9/0 renekton coming for you. What makes this Darius think \"man, next time i will get him for sure\"? It is very hard to solo carry when others cant understand that not dying, is just as important as getting kills.","replies":[{"poster":"Theorchero","date":"2017-06-07T13:22:21.091+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":3,"body":"Oh please.\n\n\"Die less\" sure, that's a decent metric.\n\nBut the reasons you die are usually a mystery to the majority of the playerbase.\n\nThe Darius? He probably wasn't trying to all in and kill the 5/0 renekton. He probably just stepped forward to Q the wave and *got* all inned, or he underestimated the total dash range of E->E Renekton, and *got* all inned.\n\nHonestly the vast majority of players in bronze wouldn't be bronze if they just gave the slightest respect to their lane opponents range of efficacy and actually learned to last hit worth a damn.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-06-07T16:11:38.126+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is kinda why I like Sion.

Stop overextending for CS and objectives. If you're alone, and you don't know where the enemy team is, _you're overextended_. Stay behind your active wards. Move with groups to establish more vision. When doing the latter, try to creep up behind your minion wave, as this also gives you vision.\n\n2. Stop hard pushing without flash, unless 1) the enemy doesn't have flash or you know you win an all in, 2) you know where every member of the enemy team is, including the jungler.\n\n3. Stop treating your tower as if it makes you immortal. If you know you're about to get three man dived, ping for help and back off until help arrives. Sometimes, this means straight up sacrificing your tower. That sucks, but it's better than giving up your tower _and_ your life.\n\n4. Stop trying to contest objectives you can't actually contest. I'm looking at you, dragons. You're not going to successfully contest a dragon 3v5, so give it up and try to take an objective elsewhere. There's no point in three of you dying for a failed attempt on an ocean drake. (Caveat: if your jungler wants to suicide steal while you do this, that's acceptable.)\n4a. Also stop trying to contest objectives when you're way behind. If it's 20-40, _you're not going to successfully fight for that air drake_. Stop it, give it up. Again, have your jungler attempt a solo steal while you trade the drake for pressure and objectives.\n\n5. Stop trying to fight without the rest of your team. You're not going to win a 4v5. If your idiot teammate gets caught out and dies, don't chase after and try to avenge him in a blaze of scornful glory. It's not going to work. You're all going to die. Fall back and regroup until your teammate respawns.\n\n6. Stop trying to save idiot teammates. Unless you're damned well sure you can save your mid laner, or unless they're _way_ more valuable than the rest of your team, don't sacrifice yourself to save them when they do something stupid. Odds are, both of you will just die.\n\n7. Stop overstaying after securing an objective. If you've got the tower, the inhibitor, whatever, and you're all low on health/cooldowns or have a ton of gold to spend, back, reset, and prepare for the next push. _Don't stay_. You're only giving your opponent an opportunity to get back into the game by fighting you at your weakest.\n\n8. Stop fighting when you've a ton of gold on you. _Even if you're ahead_, you're only giving your opponent the chance to get back into the game with a crucial shutdown. Don't do that. Stop it. Stop getting greedy. Cash out and come to the next fight even stronger.\n\n9. Stop chasing deep into unknown territory, unless you're 100% sure where every member of the enemy team is. Odds are, that guy you're chasing is running toward his nearest teammate. If you don't know where you're going, _stop_ chasing. You're essentially overextending.\n\nAll right, that's all I can think of off-hand.

I speak from personal experience. Assuming a Nasus who E-Max's first is going AP will ultimately end you itemizing poorly when he then goes for the traditional build after he has amassed enough farm. \n\nPersonally I think E-max is fundamentally weaker playstyle that rewards a lazy play style of Nasus that will ultimately back fire. However putting 3 levels in E early vs ranged AA champions like Teemo, Vayne and Draven is often wise especially if you are higher elo and they know wtf they are doing. But you have to go for Q max after that 3rd point and start getting stacked b/c even if you out farmed they will out scale if you do not get the damage on your Q. \n\nBasically never assume anything. Darius is also one of those champs who always needs respected even if he did shitty in lane b/c he still has a passive AD bleed, true damage and hell of a lot of armor shred and can easily turn a team fight around.
