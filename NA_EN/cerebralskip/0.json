This is not uncommon for me so I did not think anything of it. Until it came my turn to pick and the client lagged when I pushed the lock in button. It turned as if I had clicked it and then stayed greyed out while the timer ran down. So I was penalized with low priority queue because I technically \"dodged\" even though the client was the cause of this issue. Normally I would just wait and move on but I was slapped with a THIRTY MINUTE penalty instead of the normal 6 or whatever. This is ridiculous, some people don't have much time to play and a 30 minute penalty can mean am entire game that I won't get to play this weekend for something that was entirely not my fault.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-13T16:28:47.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lagging in champion select suggests a poor network, and can cause you to lose sync or disconnect entirely.  It is really important that this is resolved, and not risk getting a [queue dodge](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging) for it.  I suggest going through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide for a list of steps to get this fixed up for good.  Otherwise, consistently leaving like this will continue to escalate your lower priority queue.
