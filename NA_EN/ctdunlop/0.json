I don't know how t level up and when I tried to look up how to I couldn't find anything. My account is level 30 and I've been playing for over a year and a half I believe and with the end of the spring LCS split I want to start a discussion about my ideas on how to improve the fantasy aspect of LCS and hopefully get back into reading the boards if I can either get this fixed or figure out how to level up.","replies":[{"poster":"ctdunlop","date":"2017-03-27T13:15:40.265+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"AAAAAAnnnnnnd its fixed :)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-27T21:12:13.912+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad to see you got it worked out on your own!
