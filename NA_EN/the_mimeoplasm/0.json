At least give us Anivia players SOMETHING for having to work twice as hard for our pressure. As much as I like making more walls, this change completely ruins already difficult matchups against mobile assassins like LeBlanc, Ahri, or Zed. Without reliable burst she doesn&#039;t even win otherwise decent matchups like Viktor or Syndra. This nerf is way out of line with your goals for control mages. You have talked about the reliable burst needed to threaten a zone in patch notes about champions like Orianna and Viktor, but then completely destroy Anivia&#039;s reliability with this patch.\r\n\r\nPlease reconsider, this change makes Anivia nigh unplayable in the current meta.","replies":[{"poster":"CppL","date":"2016-11-23T08:20:48.271+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"Her RE combo had no counterplay.There is nothing to discuss here anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Sona Ping","date":"2016-11-23T09:23:17.283+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"There's plenty to discuss.

Saying that it lacked counterplay is fine, but when Anivia now is forced to get close to a target and maintain that distance without getting hit by a stun, or without her target simply walking out of her ultimate before it finishes channeling, and not increasing the reward for the extreme increase in the risk? That is ridiculous. \n\nHer Q has always had an extremely slow movement speed and a really long cooldown in order to create counterplay and create a vulnerability to exploit in her plays. \n\nThe only thing that was ever reliable about her kit was her RE combo, which had an effective cooldown of about 6 seconds. Her build naturally avoids most cooldown reduction items since most do not provide the mana regeneration or flat mana she needs to handle her extreme mana costs. Compared to say, Viktor, who happily builds a morellonomicon and an hourglass to reduce hisE to a 6 second cooldown and his Q to ~3 seconds, his burst is more reliable than Anivia's, has greater range, and even less counterplay since his Q can't miss, where at least Anivia could run the risk of missing her R or the enemy flashes/dashes out of her R and the frosted debuff wore off before the E hit for damage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"legionnaire99","date":"2016-11-23T07:58:44.004+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":4,"body":"O NO DID THEY MAKE HER BURST TAKE SKILL!","replies":[{"poster":"The Mimeoplasm","date":"2016-11-23T08:06:20.805+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=curtin123456,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pIIlAPRc,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-11-23T07:58:44.004+0000)\n>\n> O NO DID THEY MAKE HER BURST TAKE SKILL!\n\nEven slow champions can casually walk out of Anivia's abilities in mid lane. Her effective range on her stun is ~1/2 to 2/3 of it's cast distance depending if the other guy is running away from you in a line, or tracking side to side. Her q is simply too slow to be reliable. \n\nSimilarly, her R channel is just too long to be reliable.

Sure there might be a small like 1 second delay (if even) before he uses Q and gets the auto attack amp but that amp could be about as long as Anivia takes to drop her ult on the target to get the first proc of it. So really....Viktor's Q is just under Anivia's E damage with as little \"counterplay\".\n\nAt least with Anivia, it requires her to use her ultimate for it and it takes 225 Mana (+60 mana for every addtional second) compared to Viktor's Q which is only 65 mana. Also the Viktor would get a movement speed + shield for hitting it, while nothing for Anivia.\n\nThat's what I don't get....Yes there wasn't a lot of counterplay to the old R>E, but there are champions in the game that can also do that much (if not more) damage then her with as little counterplay while using only basic abilities, less mana and extra effects/buffs in them. Hell even {{champion:31}}'s Q does more then Anivia's E and even his silence is almost stronger then it as well though I know it's hard to land Chogaths Q some times but still the point stands.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pnakotic","date":"2016-11-23T11:04:30.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or Syndra press R to the win lol ^-^","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wonderlands","date":"2016-11-23T09:26:39.688+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Don't be salty cuz now you have to actually land her skill shot to do damage.
