What it basically boils down to is:\n\nThe client will open, I'll queue for a game, I'll sit in the queue for two or so minutes, and then when I finally get impatient and cancel the queue, the game will refuse to let me out and I'm \"stuck\" in queue until I have to force-quit the game.\n\nI've tried queueing with friends to see if the match found screen pops up--which it does--but when I click accept it doesn't seem to register and then whoever I'm in queue with tells me that \"you didn't click accept and now we're out of queue\". While that's happening, however, my client still thinks we're in a group and that we have requeued. We clearly haven't, though, because the timer ticks forever on my end and on my friend's end we're not even IN a queue. And, surprise surprise, when I try to back out of this fake-queue on my screen, it won't let me yet again.\n\nIn other terms--the queue seems to \"pop\" but it never shows up on my screen and so I can never accept it (or, in the case of queueing with friends, the queue DOES pop, but it doesn't seem to recognize my \"match accept\").\n\nCan anyone help me out with this? I can't be the only one getting this problem.\n\n(For context, I'm running the game on a macbook. I'm currently in the process of using the Hextech Repair Tool, but that also seems to be stuck at generating R3D logs...)\n\nAny help would be appreciated. I haven't been able to play the game ever since the new client came out.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-11-07T23:35:48.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a sign that your client is unable to connect to the Server!
