I try to run at him and trade during his \"weak early game\" he E's and i cant engage cuz LMAO the slow. Then I try run away he E's me again for like 250 MAGIC damage so I cant even build armor to counter him LOL great design. I do nothing then he free farms. Suddenly in the event I engage and get him to 25% HP he uses his W and auto attacks THREE times and HE IS LITERALLY AT FULL HEALTH AGAIN LOL.\n\nWhat the hell Riot, nerf this champion into the dumpster if you want to save your companys integrity.\n\n\nRemember to Like, Comment and Subscribe for more Threads.","replies":[]}
