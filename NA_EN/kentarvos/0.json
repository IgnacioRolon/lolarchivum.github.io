Turning off the language filter in the client has no effect, and I haven't found an option in the in-game menu to change it either. There was an old, archived thread that had a fix that looked like this;\r\n\"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client\\releases\\(lat est version)\\deploy\\preferences\r\n\r\nOpen up the shared(character name).PROPERTIES file up with Notepad\r\n\r\nIt should say:\r\n\r\n[Chat]\r\nEnableChatFilter=1\r\n\r\nSet the number to 0\"\r\n\r\nbut when I went through the file path detailed there, there was no lol_air_client folder. Are there any other ways to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-05T04:49:42.747+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, this issue is quite annoying!
