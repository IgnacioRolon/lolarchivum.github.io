It's such a joke how the people who have run down lane mid 40x in single games consistently still get to continue trolling further games with the same method because they simply said. \"Sorry bad game\" so that riots system doesn't pick them up as \"inting.\"\n\nSame goes for people who are PURPOSELY baiting out others to see if they can get a toxic response and then reporting the person they literally trolled all game to the point of them not being able to enjoy the game they are in. However because of the way some of these people set out to troll, they are not picked up even when a report is sent in to the system.\n\nOur current report system is a joke. I literally had someone tell me to KMS because I didn't want to give them my lane that I queued for and was ASSIGNED. This person then went to my lane and sat at my tower the first 7mins of a game and proceeded to mock me. Are they still playing? Yes. Did they get any form of a punishment? Not that I can see. They have queued up every day. They literally put a space in between how they typed something to me and instead of the system still flagging and banning them \"because KYS IS bannable with no tolerance according to rito\" they got around the filter and have enjoyed prolly displaying the same behavior towards others. \n\nThese type of people know how to play the system and continue to this day to promote toxicity. When tribunal existed we had about half the toxic behavior we have now but at least players were able to deal with the issues right then and there. Now tickets can rot for days in queue just to have no form of action taken except a bot tell you \"checking into query blah blah but you won't know the result of the investigation.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Anivia OTP","date":"2019-10-28T20:48:53.416+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"a single insult is already too much\n\nsecond of all, you got permabanned, meaning that you got banned 2 weeks prior to this punishment\nDidn't you understand that you should have been banned the first time , and riot gave you a last chance ?\nWas insulting that person worth your account ?","replies":[{"poster":"Nagake","date":"2019-10-28T20:52:15.478+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Anivia OTP,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=OPFfPY2u,comment-id=0015,timestamp=2019-10-28T20:48:53.416+0000)\n>\n> a single insult is already too much\n> \n> second of all, you got permabanned, meaning that you got banned 2 weeks prior to this punishment\n> Didn't you understand that you should have been banned the first time , and riot gave you a last chance ?\n> Was insulting that person worth your account ?\n\nI wasnt banned, i only had a mute or something like that a few years back, nothing in the recent past","replies":[{"poster":"The Anivia OTP","date":"2019-10-29T01:40:36.913+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"make a ticket it's not normal , you're not supposed to be banned off a simple insult\nplease come back with the support's answer","replies":[{"poster":"Nagake","date":"2019-10-29T01:56:16.169+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Anivia OTP,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=OPFfPY2u,comment-id=001500000000,timestamp=2019-10-29T01:40:36.913+0000)\n>\n> make a ticket it's not normal , you're not supposed to be banned off a simple insult\n> please come back with the support's answer\n\nI made it as soon as i got banned, still waiting for the response~","replies":[{"poster":"Applesauceys","date":"2019-10-30T10:10:54.614+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your just gonna get told they won't do anything about it.

I never start any kind of conflicts in chat because I understand some people simply just are not that good or are having an off game, but if someone comes at me I WILL respond.
