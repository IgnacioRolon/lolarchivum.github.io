They could be just the backstories or lore of each champion. It would be a good way to get people to know their champions better, or maybe even learn something new. Also to teach newbies what they&#039;ll be getting themselves into when trying to decided what champion to use. It would interesting, knowledgeable, nice change of pass from the MMO, and most importantly, fun. ( more maybe a some kinda ahh.. noble kinda deals, where voice actors can do the noble for the champion they voiced for in LoL..)","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-01-08T15:40:13.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fx_9E0Uu9Cg/maxresdefault.jpg","replies":[]}]}
