I assure you that I am not the only one disappointed by this seeming lack of concern on your part.  There are many, like myself, that look forward to relaxing with a few good plays and fun games at the end of a hard day of work.  And if I am so bothered by this I would hate to think how competitive players are feeling about these problems.  In, unexaggeratedly, every game I have played over the past week someone has DC'd, albeit most temporarily.  That in addition to 2k ping causing my champ to look like a wild Frogger on the Rift makes the game purely frustrating and unenjoyable.  I hope you find a way to fix it soon Riot, you've not let us down yet.  Don't start now.","replies":[{"poster":"TruffleMcShuffle","date":"2014-09-19T21:55:42.641+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIOT you are wrong. It is on your end 100% I started playing dota 2 and Infinite Crisis with no lag. I play mmo's with no problems at all. To the person who posted this thread you are wrong. This problem has been going on for a month now. Ive done everything you asked riot to identify the problem and when you asked me to submit these tests with my network and process i did so only to get no response. Your game is unplayable and you continue to just blow it off and expect people to pay for champions and buy RP. You should be sued if it was even possible to do so. Offering a product that doesn't work and coming out with new products that customers cant even use is fraud. But it is what it is and you wont do anything to fix it so ya have a nice day.","replies":[]},{"poster":"C9 DerKen","date":"2014-09-19T21:11:10.595+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is this lag...","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-09-19T01:57:41.495+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hello CelMySoulForYou,\n\nFirst, I want to thank you for coming to the Boards and the new Help and Support Community.  That being said, lets dig into your issue a bit.\n\nIt is true that the NA servers have been going through some rough times in the past couple of weeks and months.  We have had server issues that made connecting to games extremely difficult.  However, these are isolated incidents and not a result of the NA servers themselves being inherently unstable.  Once we identify and quickly resolve these issues, we do not see serverwide issues with lag and disconnection issues.  \n\nTo that end, if you are experiencing issues connecting to games or experiencing extreme 2k ping spikes day to day, and from game to game, it seems that the root cause to this issue might lie somewhere else.  I am by no means claiming the issue is 100% on your end, but we do need to start ruling out root causes so that we can identify where the root cause is.  Because of this, I strongly recommend that you complete all of the steps in the following guide:\n\nhttps://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/26932010-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues\n\nThey resolve the majority of connection issues and will allow us to rule out multiple different causes.  If you are still consistently getting these issues, make sure to [send us over a new request](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new) and include the logs at the bottom of this post.  These logs will allow our Tech Specialists to analyze your network, confirm if there are any issues there, and continue investigating. \n\n1) Network Analysis: https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/27495980-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq1\n\n2) NetworkInfo Log: https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/27495980-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq4\n\n3) Process List: https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/27495980-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq3 \n\nI hope this helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Sedreth","date":"2014-09-19T23:27:35.527+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\" We have had server issues that made connecting to games extremely difficult.

Probably more like thousands without much exaggeration....It sounds like the only thing \"isolated\" about these incidents is NA.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vexom1","date":"2014-09-19T23:26:53.915+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am not being disrespectful...

It is likely that my next leave will result in a permanent ban. Something has to be done, I've spent money and time on this game and the way I see it, I should just quit, because even if i create a new account, riot is just going to troll ban me after their servers d/c me or crash.
