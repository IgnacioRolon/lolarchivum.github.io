I wanted to create this thread to see if there were any other players like myself, who suffer from this disorder. \r\n\r\nUsually people ask what it is and don&#039;t understand right off the bat and assume you&#039;re shy or that forcing yourself into social situations will somehow cure this disorder magically, but they are far from being right. As defined by the institute here: http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/social-anxiety-disorder/basics/definition/con-20032524 , it is a mental health condition that causes irrational fear of any type of social situation, these include: \r\n\r\n* Fear of situations in which you may be judged\r\n* Worrying about embarrassing or humiliating yourself\r\n* Concern that you&#039;ll offend someone\r\n* Intense fear of interacting or talking with strangers\r\n* Fear that others will notice that you look anxious\r\n* Fear of physical symptoms that may cause you embarrassment, such as blushing, sweating, trembling or having a shaky voice\r\n* Avoiding doing things or speaking to people out of fear of embarrassment\r\n* Avoiding situations where you might be the center of attention\r\n* Having anxiety in anticipation of a feared activity or event\r\n* Spending time after a social situation analyzing your performance and identifying flaws in your interactions\r\n* Expecting the worst possible consequences from a negative experience during a social situation\r\n\r\nThese symptoms can lead to self consciousness in the worst possible terms, depression, making yourself physically sick to where it can cause heart problems and in extreme cases suicidal ideology. \r\n\r\nNow that I&#039;ve clarified exactly what this mental disorder is, is I wanted to ask if anyone else suffers from this mental disorder within the League Community? I know that most with this disorder would even find it hard to post on the forums, but I wanted to take the time to do this to not just reach out, but to see if there was a sense of support that could be found within the community of one of my favorite games.","replies":[]}
