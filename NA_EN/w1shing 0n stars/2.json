Unfortunately, the addiction had lead to him developing epilepsy and eventually, his body just began to shut down all together, especially over this last year. Wenesday night, he had a seizure that caused him to go into cardiac arrest, and he couldn&#039;t be resuscitated.\r\n\r\nEverything feels really surreal right now, and I know that I&#039;ve had my own share of drinking problems... families even compared me to him; But, since I had last visited him (about a week ago) I haven&#039;t even been able to touch alcohol, or even look at it without getting sick.\r\n\r\nStill though, how does one cope? I never thought I would lose my oldest brother, he was only 33.","replies":[]}
