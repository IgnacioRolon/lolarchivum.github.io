Support has been useless to fix this btw which sucks i havent been able to play for 3 months. My point is that seeing ping in the loading screen wont really help with this. Besides the people who dont believe someone is actually lagging are just going to rage at them for playing with high ping in the first place.","replies":[]},{"poster":"That Rat Bastard","date":"2014-10-10T14:25:50.946+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"riot should for sure bring this back, this is a great idea!","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlazingSalvo","date":"2014-10-10T19:47:27.861+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Hey guys, Talon must be an East coaster, he has 112 ping!
