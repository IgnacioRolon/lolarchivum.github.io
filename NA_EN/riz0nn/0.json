Then he told me he would send my ticket to a specialist and that it would take an unknown amount of time, and he never got back to me. \n\nA week later i got an email asking \"Your ticket has been marked as solved! :D\" and a survey asking how i enjoyed my experience...\nI opened up another ticket saying that my last one was marked solved but it wasnt and I got an inconsiderate response saying \"your ticket is being handled on a different thread #21212121 \"... wtf is that. \n\nSo i tweeted about that to riot support and you know what they said? \"open up another ticket\"    --_______-- u have to be joking.\n\nthen i sent a message to riot support saying that if i cant play the game because of this bug, that no one is willing to help me with, then i want my account closed and my money back, because its not fair, with the amount of money ive spent on the game, that i cant play. AND U KNOW WHAT THEY SAID?        nothing, they said absolutely nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-03T22:47:25.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look at this for you, and see that your ticket was closed a while back.  There was an issue affecting some players at the time, and a member of the tech team gathered your information to fix things up for you.  If you're still experiencing an issue then there may be something else that's causing it, and we can take another look through a support ticket.  \n\nI'm just now seeing your other post, because to be honest we're pretty new here on the boards and likely weren't around to see it.  To clarify, we're currently helping out on Help & Support boards only.  I understand that your experience hasn't felt too great, but I promise we're here to help as we can.  We don't have a magic wand, and some things just require extra work from both parties to dig deeper and figure out what's going on.  We're happy to assist if you'd like to put in that ticket!","replies":[{"poster":"Hitchens","date":"2016-08-04T00:45:00.595+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you're a sweetheart. <3","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
