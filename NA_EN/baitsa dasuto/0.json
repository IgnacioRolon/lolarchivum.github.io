Here's what I do:\r\n\r\n1. Start game with Jungle Vi. Buy Machete and Pots. Start jungling as normal. Skill order is W->E->Q\r\n2. I approach a jungle camp and charge into it.\r\n2.a) Sometimes I charge through the wall and sometimes I don't\r\n2.b) Sometimes I hit my E during the Vault Breaker, sometimes immediately afterwards\r\n3. After Hitting all the members of a camp with the Vault Breaker and using my E on them, I start autoattacking as normal\r\n4. For some reason, none of the minions in the Jungle Camp fight back. I get to attack and kill them without taking a sliver of damage\r\n5. I've seen this trigger with the Wolf Camp, the Twin Golems, the Wraith Camp and the Big Wraith (which was much easier to kill because of this bug). I don't remember if this bug triggered with Red or Blue.\r\n\r\nI know there's a lot of variables in this one, but I cannot seem to reliably trigger this one.\r\n\r\nI decided I't try this out *just now* in a custom, and I was able to trigger a variation of the glitch:\r\n\r\n0. Started a custom on Summoner's Rift. Vi only, blue side.\r\n1. Bought Spirit Stone\r\n2. Skilled QQWE\r\n3. Charged into the Double Golems from behind the wall (red buff side) with E on and started autoattacking the small golem. The small golem did hit back, the large one didn't.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Afic","date":"2014-09-23T01:48:45.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info on this!

As near as I can tell, if you first damage a camp by dashing over a wall into it, the attack *animation* doesn't play. However, you still take damage as if they were auto attacking, and if you move far enough away that the camp has to move to attack you, the error ends and their AA animations start playing again.","replies":[{"poster":"Baitsa Dasuto","date":"2014-09-23T00:12:54.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've experienced this glitch as well, but with Vi, I did NOT take damage from jungle creeps who weren't playing their AA animation.","replies":[]}]}]}
