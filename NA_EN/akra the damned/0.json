One, the way he's handling me as a human doesn't at all indicate any kind of sympathy or empathy to people in the situation that he mentioned earlier. It makes much more sense to be sympathetic to someone who's being respectful, polite, and at least trying instead of putting their effort into being nasty to everyone. I have no sympathy for someone who says, \"What a fucking idiot. Why the hell did you build that? Are you stupid?\" versus someone who would say something like \"Hey, most of their team is AD, it might not be the smartest idea to build a spirit visage.\" If you get impatient with humanity and treat them all like idiots after trying constructive criticism on only one person, you've clearly the wrong impression on the way humanity works. Every individual is different and there is NO excuse for getting impatient and treating people like shit.\n\nAnd it's my mantra, man. I love Leona, I'm a Leona main.

Saying it's fine, not fine, couldn't make up their mind.\n\n4 : Definitely this. My biggest problem out of all 6. Getting on my nerves. Usually 3-5 times for me. Lucky if I make it on the first or second try.\n\n5 : This is the one problem I actually don't have that many others seems to be having.\n\n6 : This use to happen to me before. During last season. Client freezes during champ select and forcibly closes. Resulting as a dodge and loss in LP. Sometimes I would dodge trolls and just take the 3LP loss instead of 15. Then later on in the day, it freezes and I lose 10LP, it counting as a second dodge when it froze on its own. BUUUT... haven't had that happen to me in awhile now.\n\n7 : (my own) Spectator Mode still freaking broke. It was fine until last half of Season 4 for me. Thought it'd be fixed by the time they put the new map in, but nope. Spectator Mode still broke to this day.\n\nEdit: This post is mentally retarded. It changed the numbers.
