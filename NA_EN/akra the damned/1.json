My moniter simply became unplugged slightly, whcih I was able to fix within a couple minutes of examination, and promptly returned to the game (to which I discovered this player&#039;s inaccurate statements)\r\nWithin the game I continued to maintain a level of maturity that was unrivaled by the player using the RIOT tag, which convinced me that this player was using the tag in error, and was indeed hacking.\r\nFor some reason I am unable to find where these screenshots are located within my hard drive, but upon description of where to find and how to post these files, can provide ample evidence that this player is very clearly not a Riot employee and is indeed misrepresenting the views of this company","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2018-03-17T03:30:24.332+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"While Necromancy may be handy (and sometimes needed) in video games, it's not the case for old forum threads.

If you simpl wanted to report a player who you think is using Riot tag without being a rioter, you could just report him for Innapropriate summoners name, and riot guys would resolve it, but clearly this is a rant about a bad game you had.\n\nOn the other hand, when you are creating a new account it says please dont use RIOT, so unless the guy is a rioter, he probably wont last long with that name, all you had to do is report innap. username","replies":[]},{"poster":"u suns of beach","date":"2017-05-23T08:38:10.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Son, please go home with me, you have played league for a few years still act like shxt...but it's fine, as a father and a family member, no one would blame u or look down on you, I mean if you go home with me, i will teach you how to farm and kill. but above all, you need to learn dat respect is the most important shxt in  your life. anyway, i felt shamed that i have a son like you, but i'm okay with that since I know you'r born to be a hater and sucker....no worry, daddy will save u. pardon for my poor english son. and last thing.

Why are you even come to player behavior forum claiming about others? It's like a match trying to warm up by wood fire, mouse comes to a cat asking for cheese. Are you trying to dig yourself a grave? Low self-awareness even. \n\nYou talked shit in lobby and in game, afked for several minutes in game and fed the enermy super hard while verbally insulting your teammates. You basically took every reason to be reported in one single game and you still whimsing about others. I don't even know how badly you need attention to actually justify doing this. \n\nGet mature as you \"claimed\" you were.

True.\n\nYour monitor malfunctioned and it took you a couple minutes to fix it. He said you AFK'd. True.\n\nWhere are all these lies? You know AFK stands for Away From Keyboard. This means, the player who is AFK simply isn't playing. He is not using his keyboard. It's a simplified, blanket term, for anyone who is standing doing nothing. It doesn't mean you literally have to disconnect to be \"afk\". So you told him to \"eat my ass\" as a joke, according to you... well, not many people take it as a joke. You said you thought it was disregarded as a troll. So you troll chat and go afk for a couple minutes. Can't you understand why this person would think you are a troll? It's simple critical thinking. Don't be upset, you brought it on yourself.\n\nAll I'm saying is, it sounds like a misunderstanding. A reasonable one, at that. Can't you just laugh it off? Like aww man I said eat my ass, and then of course my monitor fucks up, so I look like even more of a troll. Figures. Just chalk it up as a misunderstanding caused mainly by yourself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-05-22T15:29:39.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a real Rioter. \n\nIf he did behave as you said, he'll loose his job, and I doubt any Rioter will be silly enough to do that. \n\nBut this surely isn't the place to report people.
