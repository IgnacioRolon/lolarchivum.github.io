Recently for some reason my game limited me to 60 fps out of no where, VSync is off, FPS Limiter on league is off, all my settings can go on low and have everything off and it will still be limited to 60 fps. I have updated all my graphics drivers and everything I can except for Java but I'm not sure if that will help since I don't know if league uses Java at all. If anyone has any suggestions please tell me because this is really making me frustrated. I have watched at least 10-15 videos on YouTube and none of them have helped. Please let me know if u have any suggestions for me. Also I have had this problem on both clients.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-30T02:08:17.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This could be caused by a few different factors, so let's try a few things out. First, ensure that the *Game DVR* feature isn't enabled in the [Windows Game Bar settings](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html). This feature has caused FPS issues for a lot of players on Windows 10 in the last few months.\n\nIf the Windows Game Bar wasn't the culprit, then this may be caused by a recent Nvidia driver update. I'd recommend rolling back to driver version **373.06** which you can find [here.](http://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/108322/en-us) Let me know if this helped!","replies":[{"poster":"DTGPRO724","date":"2016-12-02T03:16:43.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!! I disabled the windows 10 Game DVR setting and my fps instantly went back up to 290-300 fps so now im going to download the Nvidia Driver because I just realized that my auto-updater wasn't working so I was still on version 369.09 xD. But seriously though thank you so much.","replies":[]}]}]}
