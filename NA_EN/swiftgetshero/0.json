After paying for said beer but before drinking it, you start a fight with another patron. You get thrown out of the bar. The bar doesn't owe you the money you spent on the beer.

Sure we're not allowed to play anymore on our accounts.  After I saw perma I froze, it's kinda like a wake-up call that your and in this case me as well are bad people online and just have to rethink what we're doing with our time. I still love league and watch LCS all the time.

It does NOT mean anyone else has to listen to you, or put up with your attitude. A private business has every right to set out rules for what they deem acceptable behavior in their game or place of business. \n\nThe First amendment does NOT protect you from the consequences of your words or actions. If you get banned from the game due to your behavior, your rights are not being violated, it's just that Riot and the player base do not want you playing with them, and are showing you the door.
