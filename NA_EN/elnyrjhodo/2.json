Last Season Climbed to G 1 then back to G 4. Now the game is trolling me at Silver. Oh you wanna promote to S 2. We are gonna give you 7 games of 0 20 clueless bot lanes. Last season it also took me twice as many games to get out of Silver. Then my allies get good to Gold 1. Then trash again to G 4. If this was a 1 v 1 I would maybe have almost 80 percent WR. But fed enemy mid and adc, sometimes with decent jg just stomps. The 1 v 4 Quadras with Darius don't happen every game. And even in those games I need another good ally and 1 decent ally. 2 pure trolls can be carried if the enemy top and jg are behind. If not gg. But the worse the player the less he surrenders.","replies":[]},{"poster":"whiteLight3r","date":"2020-02-19T07:30:56.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"story of my life. Last season (came back to league after not playing for multiple seasons) I put a bunch of games into ranked (100+) and I bounced between s1-s4 like 3 times. I would grind to s1 and then go on crazy losing streaks until s4 and repeat.\n\nIdk what the hidden matchmaker decisions are but they are making me hate ranking. Prob wont complete placements in s10","replies":[]}]}
