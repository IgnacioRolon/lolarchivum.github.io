IMO she has strongest zoning and kiting capability in the game. \r\n\r\nSo first off let's just look at her tool tip so you can get an idea of just how much damage you can do! \r\n\r\n**Unleashed Power**\r\n(Active): Draws upon Syndra's full cataclysmic power, harnessing all Dark Spheres to deal magic damage to her target per sphere. Unleashed Power will use the three spheres that orbit Syndra, ensuring a minimum damage.Â \r\nAll Dark Spheres remain on the ground for 6 seconds after Unleashed Power is used.\r\nCost: 100 mana\r\nCooldown: 100 / 90 / 80 seconds\r\nDamage per Sphere: 90 / 135 / 180 (+0.15 per ability power)\r\n\r\nMinimum Damage (3 spheres): 270 / 405 / 540 (+0.45 per ability power)\r\n\r\nDamage with 7 spheres: 630 / 975 / 1260 (+1.05 per ability power)\r\n\r\nIt still does so it of damage with the minimum amount of spheres so once late game comes around you should be able to drop them with 1 skill rotation. \r\n\r\nYou're going to need 40% CDR.. To do this go 21/0/9 going for cdr or you could even go with 9/0/21 for utility but I wouldn't reccomend this.. \r\n\r\nFirst buy a Grail vs ap or morellonomicon vs Ad,, that's 20%cdr right there.. \r\nNext buy Boots of lucidity and you're capped at 40% with the extra Cdr from your masteries.\r\n\r\nSo here's what you do.. Q then Q again,, the next part is what makes or breaks the 7 sphere ult.  after you have the 2 spheres out the first one should be about to expire as your q is coming off the cool down for casting the second sphere.  You will have to Q AND use W at the same time to pick up the first sphere then immediately drop it back down and hit R,, and there you have it a 7 sphere ult that will completely decimate health bars.. \r\n\r\nI recommend smart cast as this makes it immensely easier to pull it off and also makes micro managing your spheres easier. Once you get comfortable with syndra I recommend you can get sorc's over lucidity as there are other items that can give you cdr and damage(DFG, buy an elixer for cost efficient cdr)  and the cdr boots take away from your burst.","replies":[{"poster":"athame","date":"2014-10-26T10:29:18.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"AHAHHAHAHA, cute. you think syndras the best kiter.

Much more versatile with it too. Ahri has no slow and her q is up less than syndras'. Not to mention the fact that stun > charm for running away.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mat7itan","date":"2014-10-27T00:18:18.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mhm","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"2000boxes","date":"2014-10-26T18:59:47.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i only got to 6 when syndra was free, now i see what i was doing wrong\ni was using my e instead of w because i thought the balls disappeared if they stood still too long","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tapu Fini","date":"2014-10-26T09:54:08.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good tip for people learning Syndra.
