He told me to kiss my account goodbye in post-game chat. Sure enough I'm permanently banned. Nice game you have here, Riot. Toxic players don't get punished for intentionally ruining the game, and a dedicated player of 10 years gets banned because the chat bots picked up on a few bad words.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2020-02-23T00:18:36.054+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really good question, actually. This is the first permban for chat i have ever seen where it was not obvious why it happened.\n\nYou can probably contest this, send in a support ticket asking for clarification.","replies":[{"poster":"hyperion3182","date":"2020-02-23T07:44:17.286+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are similar posts on a daily basis. The common point is that some people think you can only be permabanned with hardcore zero tolerance stuff. Its not true, you can be permabanned if you are constantly negative and follow the IFS protocol 10cr, 25cr, 14d ban, permaban. Its possible to be permabanned for typing \"trash\" BUT it doesnt mean you got permabanned because you only said \"trash\". Its an accumulation of incidents, with a final one that can be seen as mild.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hyperion3182","date":"2020-02-23T07:41:43.854+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you got a 14day ban recently (and I bet you did according to opgg), its a valid permaban. After a 14d ban, theres no more tolerance, any mild incident can trigger a permaban. \"Trash\" is enough. Remember you didnt lose the account for an isolated last mild incident. You lost the account because you KEPT breaking the rules. Also remember that reform cards are almost never exhaustive. If it would have been your very first first flaming, maybe you would have chat restrictions or nothing.\n\nhttps://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-","replies":[]},{"poster":"shh im hiddens k","date":"2020-02-23T00:00:36.328+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"yikes rito system is a big yikes","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lock On","date":"2020-02-22T23:21:28.668+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"Really wish Riot expressed a little more gratitude for their veteran players. Unfortunately the only thing we can do is speak with our wallets. Not that it'll make much of a dent unless the playerbase as a whole grows a spine and stops buying into every new skin release before Riot stabilizes their shitty fucking client or plays their game before releasing patch updates. But hey, you can always make a new account, only this time don't bother buying content knowing how easily Riot will delete your account over some petty back and forth between you and a trouble-making player.","replies":[{"poster":"Sefeed","date":"2020-02-22T23:30:01.291+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"Nah I won't be making another account. Clearly this game isn't what it used to be. I've never encountered such a high percentage of players who behave poorly in-game and go unpunished because they keep quiet in chat.
