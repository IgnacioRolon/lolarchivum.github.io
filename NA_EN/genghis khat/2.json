You want to know something else? You will get LESS armor pen/lethality up until late into the game since you don't get the full lethality until lvl 18. Sorry but I love when people actually think that somehow there is this massive amount of extra armor pen than what we had before... that is not the case at all. We have a slight very minor increase in lethality that is counter balanced by the fact that you do not get the full amount instantly but need to wait until lvls 13-18 to get them","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sir Saltarin","date":"2019-02-17T17:07:16.068+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"AD assasins without lethality were stronger, remember S3 Zed being tier S for a long time?\n\nNo thanks, keep lethality.","replies":[{"poster":"LTK KoRo","date":"2019-02-18T13:48:33.535+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> AD assasins without lethality were stronger, remember S3 Zed being tier S for a long time?\n\nthat's a good reason to revert lethality and assassins update, assassins are so shit right now","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Saltarin","date":"2019-02-18T16:11:21.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Gameplay Boards:\n\n>Wants to go back to when lethality didn't exist forgetting that assasins were stronger back then\n\nMe, an intelectual:\n\n>Wants to keep lethality because as it is now, lethality make assasins worse","replies":[{"poster":"LTK KoRo","date":"2019-02-18T16:21:38.359+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"being an adc abuser doesn't mean being intelectual :(((\n\nstill boards are dumb indeed","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2019-02-17T15:55:32.841+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":30,"body":"Cass had no armor built and is naturally very squishy, Zed has a level advantage, Zed landed every single ability +an auto attack + multiple Q's + ignite + electrocute.\n\n Zed _must_ be broken because an assassin landing all his abilities on a squishy target with no armor while using electrocute and ignite shouldn't result in a kill.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Saltarin","date":"2019-02-17T17:07:56.980+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":6,"body":"Dont forget to mention that it happened because they forced Cassio flash on a gank earlier.","replies":[{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2019-02-17T17:09:26.125+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":7,"body":"Careful, speaking like that will get you mass downvoted in these parts.

(JG item was cinderhulk) This was WITH elixir of Iron. Zed had no elixir...\n> \n> **Actually, Zed wasn't even full build, but I was. I also slowed it down enough so you could see how badly he missed his skillshots while melting me, as well as how the support was doing no damage.**\n> \n> - Items at bottom (Plus iron elixir for amumu), Amumu stats on left.\n> - Zed didn't even use his item actives.\n> - Can't say I didn't build tanky enough, look how little damage I was doing to an \"Assassin\" ADC, and Support. Oh but \"tanks are overloaded with base stats\" lol.\n> - I'm not saying I should be crushing everyone in my path, I am a tank, but I certainly shouldn't be getting melted like that by an assassin because....well...I am a tank...This game lasted over 50 minutes just on my team having to play around a Zed and only won because his positioning was horrible which gave us ways to slow play around him.\n> - The opposing team was almost 100% AD, we had 4 bruiser/tanks and it took us over 50 mintues to close it out simply because defense is ineffective in league...\n> - We took 1 Rift Herald, 2 dragons and **FOUR** barons before we were finally able to close it out. We ended up closing it out by doing a 3 lane split push and not engaging. (Retreat any lane they attack and push others with minions) In short, we couldn't close out against them until we vocally communicated with eachother, and decided to let the minions carry us.\n> \n> https://gfycat.com/LankyThoseKiskadee\n> \n> Honestly, I originally never realized how bad zed was until I got him in a random mode and was able to win by just smashing QWER repeatedly while holding the mouse over opponents, not even knowing what my abilities did.\n> \n> \"Look at the moves, look at the plays\" he literally held the mouse over his opponent while smashing all his keys...\n\nBack in season 4 you actually needed tiamat or bork or even both as Zed to oneshot. That is two additional imputs.\n...These are now removed. He is low effort low risk now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Astrovert","date":"2019-02-18T17:04:06.208+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The whole stupid amount of damage on champions that go invisible is starting to make me not like League anymore.\n\nI mean stupid damage and basically untargetable?
