Ahri had her tails while in movement, Lissandra had her ponytail, and Aurelion had his free floating body. A snake, like Cassiopeia's lower half, does not free flow and does not operate with drag-along physics - the entire snake has to be slithering in order to properly move. Her movement animations are actually pretty decent, and if she needs anything, it's a base skin recall animation.","replies":[{"poster":"FantasySniper","date":"2016-08-18T13:17:29.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you know how a snake's turning works?

Having her tail act like Sol's is physically unfeasible because her lower half still has to actually exert force to propel her, where as Sol's lower half I'd simply drug along by the top.","replies":[{"poster":"FantasySniper","date":"2016-08-18T23:35:13.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's physically unfeasible to move your tail in the same position relative to your body while you're on the ground, but not when you're in the air?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Im Kinda Stupid","date":"2016-08-18T13:41:29.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What im hoping for is that Cass' movent mimics that of Dota 2 Medusa... just wishful thinking :3","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MavenSong","date":"2016-08-18T01:09:37.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed, Sona could use this. \n\n... im not biased.... nope","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2016-08-18T23:10:15.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course not. ;D\nI agree though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Onkel Malte","date":"2016-08-18T08:59:55.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd absolutely love to see some more visual updates of Janna and Sona. \n\nBut there are actually over 75 champions in need of Visual, Voiceover or Gameplay updates, even more than Janna and Sona.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Matezoide","date":"2016-08-18T01:24:33.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ahri is the only old champion that got this because she is special and her players would probably have a heart attack otherwise.","replies":[]}]}
