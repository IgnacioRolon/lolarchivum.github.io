I usually only alt-tab out like once a match and it doesn't happen every time, but last night it went on for multiple games in a row some how? it's really strange...","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Winterisraining","date":"2017-10-09T06:54:49.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only way I ever found out how to fix this was to redownload the game, but that's really time consuming.","replies":[]}]}
