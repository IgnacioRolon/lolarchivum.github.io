Where's My Nocturne Rework At?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't {{champion:56}} Nocturne, The Eternal Nightmare use to be one of the most well known champ in League? Over this course of couple of years, Nocturne has now blend in to {{champion:238}} Zed's shadow who we just barely remember as \"the one who went kamikaze\" and start team fight. What is Nocturne anymore? When the \"Assassin Update\" was announce I'm sure  all the present Nocturne main was eager to see their favorite diver take some kind of rework in to the real nightmare that he is. Even so Nocturne is always a laughing stock for people every time someone fail his ult because they were afraid he can't escape once he dive. I believe Nocturne is one of the speediest jungler but he lack mechanic to outplay. Even a cheap champ like {{champion:11}} Master Yi has higher mechanic than Nocturne. Even If anyone can build the best item like {{item:3142}} and {{summoner:6}} both together you can't even escape a simple chase. I know all those Nocturne main understand how weak Nocturne is out of the meta right now. Their for i ask for support for Riot improve this forgotten champ into someone fit to play with.","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-10-27T18:05:04.274+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's a Diver, not an Assassin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pikmints","date":"2016-10-27T07:31:56.618+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember seeing posts about this a while back. People basically said that Nocturne fits more into the diving fighter archetype than the assassin one.\n\nHis RQ+Passive doesn't do a ton of damage in a single rotation unlike most assassins' full combos unless he's gotten very fed, which already can be said about most fighters. His utility is intended to let him stick to targets for as long as possible, meaning that he's intended to deal his damage over an interactive duration. Where assassins often have the ability to hop into and out of a fight, Noc has no way out other than surviving whatever damage is thrown at him, requiring him to build bulkier than assassins while utilizing his passive lest he only use his ult for picks instead of engages.\n\nSo he is _able_ to be played as an assassin, but he's intended and designed to play as the diving fighter.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-27T04:47:08.786+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since this is a post about the balance of the game and Nocturne {{champion:56}} , I recommend posting this on the [Gameplay Boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance) where it will get more traction and discussion.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"GhostOfShrimpmas","date":"2016-10-27T06:49:48.406+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got excited when I saw this thread in the red tracker, since I don't think any Rioter has mentioned Nocturne in years, probably not since the lore removal was announced. \n\nAt least he technically got a red post mentioning him.","replies":[{"poster":"DwarvenGiant","date":"2016-10-27T07:53:55.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's actually been talked about by the likes of Reav3- How Nocturne will probably be getting _some_ changes with the eventual Diver Roster Update. :P","replies":[]}]}]}]}
