What I do have is that it tells me that I have failed to connect and have to close the client immediately after every game, with no other option despite every game being play to the end (with random dc's that make no sense but nothing unmanageable).\r\n\r\nThis started directly after the update. I've never had this issue before. My network is fine and everything else is connected and working for me but LoL client. I was curious if anyone had any suggestions beyond the support options, I've tried those, and no results.","replies":[{"poster":"myninjaaaaa","date":"2017-11-28T21:27:56.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same issue","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-28T20:27:44.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This can happen if your network is unstable and failing to transition from the game server and back to the client.  It also sounds like you're having some connection stress, so it's likely you'll see this as you try to reach other services.  Though your internet is fine, you can still have problems reaching servers.
