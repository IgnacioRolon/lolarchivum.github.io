Sorry Riot I Got a leaver Buster because I had to go pick help my brother from falling off his trampoline and severely hurting himself. Sorry riot forgive me all powerful gods for being a human being and helping my brother with his bleeding knee because this game is all important. Better type \"I agree\" to not help my brother when he is hurt and screaming for help. :/ This company is a joke. Especially when I come back to the game before its over....","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-11T05:49:47.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should absolutely help your brother if he ever hurts himself, regardless of whether League exists or not. Nobody would blame you for that. However, that doesn't exactly translate over to the punishment here. It's good you chose to take care of your brother for sure, and that's far more important than one game of League, but it doesn't erase what happened either.\n\nAlso, you won't ever get a leaverbuster from just one left game!

So you are very wrong about me not getting a leaver buster from one game. Which I did and I returned to the game too and lost exp. I just dont think i should be punished for that. Also it was a bot game. \n\nAlso what do you even mean \"it doesnt erase what happened\" ??? that completely contridicts everything you just said, your basically saying \"yea you should definately help your brother by all means, \"BUT\" you still left a game and it doesnt change that\" <<< thats so heartless.

Riot is not obligated to look at hundreds of thousands of left games per *day* and determine if the reason was valid or not. The system treats **every** leave equally - someone leaves a game, they don't get credit for the game.\n\nYou were not \"punished\" - a punishment would have involved a \"Low Priority Queue\" for 5 games (starting at 5 up to 20 minutes) - where you'd have to wait before joining the queue. That only happens on players that leave very frequently. If you only run into the occasional emergency such as this you will not receive an actual punishment from LeaverBuster.","replies":[{"poster":"eºƒ","date":"2018-01-11T06:23:38.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"k. thanks for being a human being :3 Ill take a picture of his bandaged leg now and get you your proof. \n ","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-01-11T06:40:18.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is simply not enough manpower for the cases to all be reviewed by humans, and it would be unfair. The system as it is now treats everyone the same - anyone leaving a game is subject to possible action or punishment. This is regardless of if they are ragequitting every other game, or if every other game their power goes out/mom calls for dinner/they have to go to work/etc. Both situations result in the same outcome - a team is left without a player. Hence why you were marked a leaver and did not receive any rewards for the game.","replies":[{"poster":"eºƒ","date":"2018-01-11T06:42:39.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is a race thing isnt it?

All you had to do was type \"I agree\" to the message you were given - which is not a punishment. It's informing you of the rules that are established. You have to agree to a set of rules when you create accounts or download almost any game now-a-days. By your logic, you were also punished simply for creating your account, as you had to agree to a set of rules to create it. Leave buster punishments come in the form of low priority queue, which gives you extended queue times. All you need to do is go AFK for at least a few minutes, and you'll be marked as AFK for a game. A few minutes can truly make a huge difference in the outcome of a match. Real life emergencies always comes first, and Riot understands. If you don't intentionally leave games because you're mad about something or someone, and you only leave during emergencies or circumstances out of your control, then you won't have much of a record of leaving games. And as a result, when you do unfortunately have to AFK or leave, you likely won't be punished for it.","replies":[{"poster":"eºƒ","date":"2018-01-11T19:09:12.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"See honey. I would fully agree with you. If the game that it happened in wasnt a Bot Game. And the 4 other players I was in the game with were IRL friends that knew what was going on and didnt report me. Your system or whatever... your coding for how it works, should definately take into consideration the other players in the game, like maybe if they dont report me for being afk or you know maybe if its a FREAKING BOT GAME????????????? Then it shouldnt even be an issue. This type of shit is a freaking turn of to new players and HOLY SHIT YES IM GOING TO BE PRETTY SARCASTIC WHEN IM BEING FREAKING PUNISHED FOR 1 HELPING MY LITTLE BROTHER... I HONESTLY DONT CARE IF YOU DONT KNOW  OR HAVE PROOF OF HIS INJURY... IT HAPPENED aND ITS MORE IMPORTANT THEN A FREAKING BOT GAME REGARDLESS OF WHATEVER FREAKING LOGIC YOU THROW AT ME. **AND 2 I RETURNED TO THAT GAME** >>>REEEEEEETURRRRRRNED <<< GONNA EMPHESIS THAT A BIT SINCE YOUR NOT READING THAT PART.... before it ended and played it out for about 10 minutes... and we  freaking won.... So ... no... your logic is flawed... the fact that im being shamed and forced to type \"I agree\" to not afk when obviously i really cant agree to something like that because anything can happen in a game that is more serious this playing the game out and there isn't any amount of reasoning or logic you can throw at me to make your point correct of valid. SO FREAKING STOP. STOP BEING A HEARTLESS GAME DESIGNER  and just apologize for how i was treated. <<<< this post by the way isnt sarcasm... its coming from a place of actual anger for being put through something actually stupid and making a traumatic situation more frustrating to deal with and ruining my day completely. AND IM ABOUT TO MAKE THIS A BIGGER ISSUE by posting this situation on reddit and other social media places ((with picture of his injury for ur \"proof\"))) to raise the issue..... if you cant admit that your company made a mistake and aplogize for it \n\n\nSIDE NOTE LITERALLY ALL MY FRIENDS IN THAT GAME... thought the entire situation stupid  too and bullshit and I will get their help as well in raising awareness to the heartlessness I was met with in boards about it. \n\n\nALSO DOWNVOTING MY POSTS??? LOL THAT DOESNT MAKE WHAT IM SAYING NOT VALID OR TRUE... YOUR JUST A SHEEP TOT HE FLOCK. JUST STOP. Im in the right here no matter what you say or do.

The rule has nothing to do with your personal circumstance, and everything to do with being AFK in a game too long. The rule which you had to agree to was not shaming you, but rather informing you. It existed and was in effect before you had to agree to it a second time. Feel free to report anything you believe is misbehavior. I'm not bothered by it, because I know I didn't misbehave.","replies":[{"poster":"eºƒ","date":"2018-01-12T03:48:46.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm making you aware that harassment is subjective... and I am feeling harassed by you.

I dont get how much more clear I need to be. There is absolutely 0 reason for you to respond to me. Go about your life. If your continuing to come to this thread to post its because you are trying to cause me mental stress which is harassment and dont say your informing me. Im telling you i dont want your information... so if you continue to give it to me then that is aggressive pressuring which is harassment. If you dont know the definition of harassment look it up. Your aggressively pressuring me to listen to your information when im asking you to stop.
