We win and lose as a team, together.\n- Being honored only slightly boosts your progression\n- Be consistently honored by being an awesome teammate\n- Multiple honors help boost your honor even more\n\nYou're 22! You're so young! You'll have all the time in the worl-...wait..nvm..(it's....it's a joke). {{sticker:sg-lulu}}\n\nAnyways, I'm not too sure on honor progression for levels pre-30; but it looks like you've been an awesome teammate - I'm sure you'll get Honor Level 3 and get to 5 quickly! If you have any more questions, just respond below!\n\nHope I helped! \n{{sticker:sg-kiko}}","replies":[{"poster":"YCondition","date":"2018-02-02T05:50:53.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Words from a Wise man","replies":[]}]}]}
