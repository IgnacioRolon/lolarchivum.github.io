Ever since I got a new laptop I've been having major issues staying connected during league games. Everything else runs fine; hearthstone, steam, EVE online, you name it. No disconnects during any game. There are times when I can go a whole day playing back to back league games when all of a sudden around 9-11 PM EST, my game disconnects then gives me a \"No internet connection\" when other internet based programs are running (Curse, etc). Only solution is unplugging my router, otherwise it will not let me past the load screen. I've read it could be my firewall or something about IP address flushing? I'm somewhat tech savvy but not enough to fix an isolated problem like this. Really appreciate the help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-16T22:31:25.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You did get a new rig, so you've got to make sure that your drivers and settings are all up to date.
