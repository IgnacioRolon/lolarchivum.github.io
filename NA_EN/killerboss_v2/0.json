Gold 5 0 LP and bronze MMR,  Silver 5 0 LP and very low bronze MMR and so forth.\n\nEdit:  You can also decay out of the tier too if you are inactive.","replies":[{"poster":"llillllilllllill","date":"2016-11-02T06:20:22.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, but when your anything above gold, you rank decays over time a certain rates, if you don't play ranked matches, and because you're in plat, if you don't play for long enough, which is what I'm assuming happened, your rank decayed.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
