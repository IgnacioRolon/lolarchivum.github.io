So I let it do that while I was at school for the morning. I come back and I decide to play some league. Logging in the game and picking a champ in champ select were good. No issues. Then when i spawn in game, the screen freezes and the sound distorts. I cant ctrl + alt + delete and have to power off manually. It does this when i spawn, while im in game and at the end of the game. I don't know how to fix this and was hoping someone on here can help me. Just to point out I was play AR URF when this happens. I never tried this in a normal game and it doesn't seem to happen in a bot game &amp; I'm not sure if its the new game mode or what. But I'm too afraid to try in a normal game. \r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"DANXTHEXNINJY","date":"2016-09-25T13:42:48.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HAVE YOU FOUND A FIX TO THIS YET?","replies":[{"poster":"gèntle","date":"2016-09-30T01:38:14.941+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-24T23:32:25.744+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The sound and freezing issue appears to be a problem caused by the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) not interacting properly with league.
