In the game when i went Tristana and he went Teemo support, he banned yi after a teammate said he wanted to use him,  took smite and teleport. He then: Teleported mid after a death and ran it down mid to give zed a free kill, stole my cs using smite and minion dematerializer then emoted a thumbs up, stole jungle monsters, went invisible during teamfights and skirmishes and watched as teammates died right next to him, did not build support item until late into the game(I doubt he got his 500 gold quest). He is purposely doing this and he even said &#039;Check my op.gg, I have been doing this for many games and riot hasn&#039;t banned me&#039; when other players, myself included, said that we were going to report him. And the chogath got tilted and raged and flamed played poorly, having 11 deaths. The teemo then said he will report him, and to be honest I&#039;m pretty sure cho&#039;gath got in trouble and not teemo. This is extremely reminiscent of videogamedunkey&#039;s punishment where he got mad over an inting malphite and got banned. I don&#039;t know if he was doing this on purpose, but the teemo was exposing everything wrong with the system: Not punishing troll builds and doing things counterproductive to the team, and punishing the people who get mad at the troll. It is like they are testing you to see if you will get mad and then punish you for taking the bait. Personally, I think the game&#039;s meta is in a place where there is many champs and builds and items that are sup optimal or even unviable which in turn make people mad when you pick something like that (Electrocute Orianna! Just Q+W+Auto! It works! LeBlanc jungle! She has a root, 2 if you use her ult!) because the meta, imo is so oppressive that you are putting yourself at a disadvantage when you do such things. But that is another discussion for another thread.\ntl;dr Riot doesn&#039;t punish trolls and their builds and picks, but the people who get mad at them for doing so and it needs a revamp. But i guess when you make as much money as them and so many people play your game, they wouldn&#039;t mind losing thousands of people to it.","replies":[{"poster":"JeonGoyangi","date":"2018-05-05T03:31:36.797+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hi Summoner!\n\nI edited out the name from your post, as per the Board rule against [Name & Shame](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/4LgZ2EwM-universal-rules).

Repeatedly pointing out mistakes they can not fix that quickly serves no purpose but to belittle them. There is a big difference between the following:\n\nPlayer A: Hey man, try to do X instead next time\n\nand\n\nPlayer A: once again no vision\nPlayer A: Once again, get picked off\nPlayer A: Maybe if you were with the team\n\nrepeated over and over in a game.\n\nWhile yes, it's not as toxic as telling someone to kill themselves, it is still toxic. It doesn't just ruin the game for the player it's directed at - it makes the game less fun for all other players involved who have to watch someone pointing out every little mistake. If players want a coach, they're free to go buy one themselves - you don't get to just assume the role and say \"but I was trying to coach them so nitpicking their mistakes is okay\".\n\nOne thing I think people also forget is that these players getting 14 day bans for the above behavior have a couple things in common that they conveniently leave out of their original posts and sometimes don't even answer questions about - history and frequency. These players have almost all had prior chat restrictions telling them this behavior is okay. Punishments escalate - Riot doesn't just sit around and let someone ruin infinite number of games and make them less fun. It is expected you improve your behavior or you will be permanently banned. Further, many of these players had just came off a smaller punishment (either chat restriction or temporary ban) - or in some cases were on a chat restriction when they got banned. If you are on or very recently off a punishment and you go straight back to negative, bossing behavior, that's a clear sign that you have no intent on improving your behavior.\n\nThe bottom line is this - the community, ever since Tribunal - when they could actually vote directly on this - has overwhelmingly decided they don't want to see bossing, negative, mistake-pointer-outers in the game. It makes it not fun to play if you constantly have to worry \"well if I fuck up he's going to harass me over it\". And it is harassment. It is unwanted attention being given to someone for playing poorly. Whether you accept that or not, that's fact.\n\nReply Quote Permalink","replies":[{"poster":"Accursêd","date":"2018-05-07T02:14:20.204+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice copy/paste but I won't be convinced that the people going around following the jungler with smite and stealing their camps are the victims if they get yelled at in chat.

As the system stands, it actually favors the trolls who do something stupid to ruin the game like say take smite and follow the jungler around and steal camps or go into lanes and int, because the people they do it to get frustrated and say something dumb in chat, and end up getting both banned, and their time wasted in a game they could never win in the first place.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-05-05T05:45:51.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Someone else trolling doesn't justify YOU doing anything (except reporting) and most likely the teemo is chat and(or) game banned.\n\ntheir no part of the game that says you have to build what everyone else tells you to, as long as you are trying, its fine, so is the same with picks, if i believe that vayne support is a great idea and i try my best, its fine, picking bad on purpose and building bad on purpose is bannable.","replies":[]}]}
