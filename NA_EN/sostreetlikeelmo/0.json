About 5 times in, I realized that it happened every time I went to upgrade an ability and put my cursor over the [+] button. I joined the game again and played for a few minutes, but by this time, the game was over and we lost. I got placed in a 5 game, 10 minute low priority queue. I started playing aram just incase it happened again and it did. However, I realized I could upgrade my abilities just fine by using [ctr] Q (W,E,R).\r\n\r\nThis is obviously not my fault. I sent bugsplat reports and everything. I think it is really unfair to put me in a low prio queue. Is there any way I can get out of it?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-22T21:44:53.602+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure what the issue is, but I'm assuming that your keys were not responding when trying to use them.
