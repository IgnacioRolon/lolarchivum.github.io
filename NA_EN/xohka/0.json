At the time, I also had Infinity, Hydra, Spirit Visage, Sunfire Cape, Trinity, 4 Dragon buffs, and an elixir of wrath. The glitch persists even after the elixir wears off.\r\nSo around 600 and above movement speed, Yasuo's model glitches with his scabbard in the front like the picture. Just letting you all know, because it looks pretty silly.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-02-24T18:00:05.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the report! \n\nWe're currently investigating the issue. :]","replies":[]},{"poster":"Starcall Casey","date":"2015-02-24T14:10:16.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a visual glitch whenever yasuo reaches above 500+ move speed no matter what boot type or other items he has. I really hope they fix this soon, it's annoying to look at especially when I get to see it for 10 seconds if a nunu uses W on yasuo","replies":[]}]}
