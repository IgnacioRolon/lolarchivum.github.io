But what I do have a problem with is when players have smurfs just to screw with players in ranked, recently I played with a dude that decided to int feed for the sole reason that I picked kayn, giving no shits since apparently his account was a smurf.\r\n\r\nThat guy will prob go and ruin at least a few more games before he gets banned, and then he&#039;d still have his main account apparently.\r\nPeople should be actually punished for ruining fun play on all their accounts instead of being about to screw people over without caring about consequences.\r\nSo just wondering why there isn&#039;t IP bans, at least for perm bans, like what Overwatch does, and that&#039;s a paid game.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2017-07-14T00:30:41.776+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"> So just wondering why there isn't IP bans, at least for perm bans, like what Overwatch does, and that's a paid game.\n\nGood question.\n\n1.)

It should be about punishments applying to all of the accounts owned by the offending player.\nWhile IP bans are a (flawed) way of doing that, they are not the only way.\n\nRiot have already alluded to the fact that they have \"fingerprints\" for all players, which they use to detect boosting and account sharing.\nBasically, each player has a unique way of playing, based on a number of factors, from the way they assign their summoner spells to the way they move the mouse and input controls.\nIf a player's fingerprint changes drastically, it suggests that someone else is playing on their account instead of the normal player.\n\nThe same fingerprinting system could be used to track and link any secondary accounts that a player might have.\nMost likely, the fingerprinting data isn't enough to uniquely identify one player out of the millions who play League, but it should be enough to significantly narrow it down.  If it were combined with extra information such as an IP address, it should be enough to have a fairly good idea of which players own which accounts.\n\nOnce the accounts are linked, then punishments to one of the accounts can be applied to all of the other accounts.\n\nNote that there is no blanket ban of IPs here.  The proposed system would just automatically detect the original owner of new accounts, and apply punishments to the other accounts accordingly.\n\nIt would be a complicated system, and you can debate as to whether or not the effort required to build it would be worth it, but the technology exists to make a system like this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CrazFight ","date":"2017-07-14T00:30:21.482+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alot of people in college play league, ip banning wouldn't work because it could ban whole dorm's, there are other examples but that one is prob one of the biggest.
