Mine happened earlier today.\r\n\r\nPlayed a ranked game as {{champion:150}}  vs {{champion:50}}  top. At the beginning, {{champion:50}}  started cussing out that \"{{champion:150}}  was such a bulls#%t champion\" and \"you are trash for picking a bulls#%t champ\". He ended with \"Are you ready to get f#%ked in top lane?\"\r\n\r\nSeeing that {{champion:50}} was pretty pissed off, I told my jungler, {{champion:106}} , to gank top a few times early game. If we could get {{champion:50}} to lose lane, he would most likely rage out, causing him to make more mistakes as he played or leave the game all together. We got two kills on Swain and the tower before 15 minutes. I then said in all chat \"I must have missed the part where you wrecked me\". \r\n\r\nAccording to his team, {{champion:50}} flamed out and then rage quit. To the dismay of my opponents, my strategy had worked. **In hindsight, it wouldn't have made a difference if {{champion:50}}  left or not; {{champion:106}}  was 7/0/4 by that time, we had two dragons, and every lane was winning hard.**\r\n\r\nI would like to express my condolences to my opponents who had to deal with a person such as that Swain summoner. Playing with ragers is never fun. \r\n\r\n**Psychology OP**","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-03-18T02:52:21.182+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Back around patches 4.19 and 4.20, before people had figured out you need to get baron whenever you can, I had this little strategy.
