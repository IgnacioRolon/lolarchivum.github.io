So i guess there must be a reason why riot is keeping me away for no legitimate reason.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-16T00:10:54.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not happening for any reason on our end, but most likely something going wrong between the game and either your graphics software or monitor settings. Update your graphics drivers, as well as the other steps you can find in our [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting). Also, double check that your League game is outputting to a resolution that your monitor supports, as if it's higher than your monitor it'll show you a blank screen like this sometimes.","replies":[{"poster":"WOWHATER","date":"2017-10-20T03:06:48.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"exactly and guess what.. how in the world can i output a resolution to my monitor higher if i can't even choose that within the game? as a default the resolution is 1920x1080 i have a predator monitor with Gsync that goes ut to 2k resolution. but the option is never there. so it beats me why riot can't make it work","replies":[]}]}]}
