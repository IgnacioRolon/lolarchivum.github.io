Before this started occurring, the league client would be left open when my family members would switch to their other mac accounts, so I'm not sure if that forces it to shut down. Anyhow, now it just happens when i click it in the task bar and that's when the message appears, and I've attempted to open it through the applications in finder. But yeah just clicking the icon makes the message pop.\n\nEdit: plot twist, it opens if I find it through the applications folder in finder, the message will display occasionally, but it still refuses to open on the sidebar (where the other programs are located).","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-03-05T21:25:49.556+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Does the message ever pop up if you launch League from the Applications Folder?
