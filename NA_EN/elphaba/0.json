This may not go anywhere but it's always worth a try. I am desperately trying to find a PAX Sivir skin. I know there are some people on this site who have given them away and I'm hoping I can run into one of you kind souls. \r\nI don't have a cute emotional story as to why I want it, unless you count being a 100% broke college kid. She's one of my favorite ADCs (though I'll admit it's not my best role) and I'd LOVE to have a skin for her while I'm working on my bot lane skills, especially this one. It's truly epic and if I had the cash I'd drop it without hesitation. My boyfriend offered to buy it for me but those skin codes are just so expensive and neither of us really has that kind of money right now, and I can't let him do that for me. I personally can't even afford Harrowing skins let alone a PAX code! I don't really have anything to offer in return except my eternal love and gratitude. \r\nThanks in advance for any help anyone can offer, and if not of course I understand, they're rare!","replies":[]}
