Particularity the targeting. When you have a ranged ghost when you click on the inhibitors, and turrets, unless you click really close to the exact center the ghost thinks you want them to walk over there, and then they pick up their auto targeting system, and start attacking. Inhibitors are particularly nasty to aim at with a ranged ghost (especially non-dragon ghosts).

That being said, I have lost Baron buff to Death's dance bleed damage because the game said for a split second 'you're dead' and stripped the buff, then realized 'But hey you're not dead, but bleeding out' but never returned the buff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Luxs Destiny","date":"2016-03-23T04:04:46.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Attempt to recreate this under the CC of A) Leona, B) Irelia, C) Cho'Gath, or D) Hecarim. \n\nThe only time that Amordis would've had baron buff was the ~40 minute mark, according to recent match history.
