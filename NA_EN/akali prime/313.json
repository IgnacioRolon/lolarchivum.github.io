I believe everyone needs to have at least mastery 4 on a champion before they can lock them in in ranked thats like 3 days to a week of learning a champion. Im sure its bearable. this will limit those people who like to first time champions in ranked then heavy feed their lane because \"who cares its just a game lol\" \r\n\r\n2. autofill does not need to exist in ranked, period. This also ties into the first point, why are you forcing a person into a role they dont play? and then punishing the entire team if they do bad and lose the game? even though its not their fault since they didnt ask to be autofilled but forcing someone to jg or support when theyve probably only played those roles a handful of times is just unhealthy itll most likely force them to play a champ they've never played before on top of a role they're not familiar with. This system even increases the chances of trolling on your team (especially in low elo) \r\nplayer 1: \"hey man can i mid i got autofilled support and idk how to supp\"\r\nplayer 2: \"nah man sorry\"\r\nplayer 1: \"oh, ok\" *bans midlaners intended champion and locks in yasuo* \r\nplayer 2: \"wtf\"\r\n*arguing ensues* \r\nits just not healthy for ranked riot.\r\n\r\n3. Ranked needs its own ban system. Just a light one for small time offenders who fuck up ranked games but not often enough to cause a suspension.\r\nif someone get reported maybe once or twice for inting or trolling it and they're score is looking like 0/10/2 ban from from queueing in ranked for a day or two. if the come back several days later and do it again, ban for a week if they do it again then we can look into account suspensions because they're clearly trolling on purpose at this point. same with toxicity. \r\n\r\n4. forced breaks after losing streaks. its simple, someone in ranked losing 5 games in a row? but they have a decent score to where they're obviously trying to win..its ok your not in trouble just go play a few norms then come back to ranked. simple lock out from ranked to have them go play X amount of norms or rotating game modes to help them get off tilt so they dont lose too much lp. show them that you actually care about their climb. if thats not possible maybe make them lost a little less lp (like 5 or 10) for one or two games if they're on a losing streak then have it go back to normal lp loss if they continue losing. \r\n\r\n5. afks and trolls. We all get them, more often than not if feels like you get them way more than the enemy team does (its definitely true for me)\r\nif a game is confirmed to have an afk in the match and if the team with the afk loses have the afk take extra lp loss while the team gets reduced lp loss (maybe like -15 or -12 lp) i dont believe this system can be abused because no one is going to want to lose 30 lp for afking if their team tries to bribe them too plus the team will still lose lp aswell. if you have to afk due to an emergency then honestly the lp loss should be the least of your worries.\r\n\r\nalso if we cant promote from splash we shouldn't be able to demote from splash lp its not fair. \r\nwell thats all i have i really feel like if riot did these 5 things...ranked would be a lot less stressful its just a system that filters out everyone who isnt serious about ranked and itll help people who actually care about ranked get to their dream ranked, you guys have to realize someone may be bronze and be a good player but they're not good enough to  solo 1v9 every game. its just not fair to expect a player to hard carry a game thats supposed to be a team game. riot should make it easier for us little guys by giving us a fair and less stressful environment to climb in. \r\n\r\n\r\nalso add unskilled report option back, a player may not have intentionally went 1/9/4 but they do not need to be on my mmr level if they're average game scores look like that.","replies":[]}
