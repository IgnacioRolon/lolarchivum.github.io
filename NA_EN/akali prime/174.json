Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Netherlife","date":"2017-04-19T01:43:50.929+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of potential for this.

I'd been thinking about how dope a space-god (or space-demon, in this case) Zed would be, and how the particles, the kit, and the character of Zed himself would fit together. I mean, they made a Dark Star Kha'Zix, which no one expected, and yet they've (from what I've seen) nailed the Dark Star aesthetic perfectly whilst still keeping it Kha'Zix. And it seems like you did the same here (although the Shuriken seems too similar to the Classic Zed Shuriken, but that's just my opinion). He gives off this very menacing, supernatural feel, which is what Zed was originally designed to give off, but on steroids. In fact, looking at the design of his head and comparing it to all the other Dark Star heads, I get this feeling of cosmic dread being emitted from the image. Which really does match the Dark Star style, what with all the Dark Stars being very similar to the Great Old Ones of H.P. Lovecraft's stories.\n\nRito seriously needs to see this. Unfortunately, if they do see this and decide to make it, I doubt he'd get it skin very soon. After all, there are a shit tonna champs they still have to work on skins for, and my boy JUST got a Championship Zed one. Though we are seeing an SKT Jhin after Blood Moon... hm... But I'd love seeing this as a Legendary Skin, and I'd buy it day one of release. Overall, I r8 8/8 m8. \n\nReally looking forward to seeing the other versions on your DeviantArt page.","replies":[{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2017-04-19T23:45:58.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, very much appreciated bro\n#zedmains4lyfe","replies":[]}]}]}
