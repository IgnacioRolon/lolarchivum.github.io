It is not affecting my gameplay or anything but its just annoying how i keep getting that window and have to click launch to get into the new client login every time. It didnt use to do this the problem started when i unpinned the lol icon from my task bar then pinned it back. Is there anyway i can get rid of this additional window that comes up before the actual client its super annoying.\n\n\nEdit: nevermind, i fixed the problem literally 2 seconds after posting that. all i did was unpin the old icon and pin the new icon to my taskbar ","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-06T21:14:11.777+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeeeaaaa it can be a little annoying when a program updates with a new shortcut and the old one no longer works.

I recently had an issue with my computer with a new installation for lol, I clicked Okay, and accept for the update to do its thing but it would just close out. This is where it all started (around 10 days ago). I researched a lot and got the common \"reinstall lol\" or \"get the hex tech repair tool\", so I reinstalled lol and begun the reinstallation and re patching process with the hex tech tool, but when I finally downloaded the LolpatcherUx, it comes up in large writing that \"the client update has begun\", and when I click launch the window closes and does not reopen. I am really confused because it has old image of the L icon for lol and also keeps explaining what Awesome things are in the new client (showing the new L icon)… But I have had the new client for ages, and these updates seemed as if they happened a while ago. \n\nDid I just download an outdated lol? or is that just the process of downloading lol, such as downloading the old lol and having to update to the new client regardless if I already had it before I uninstalled lol. I've had many other issues leading up to this one, and have solved them myself, but I cannot figure out a way to make this damn game WORK!\n{{summoner:3}}","replies":[{"poster":"SteveoBuscemio","date":"2017-12-10T03:26:19.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did hear something from riot that they are fixing a lot of shit and putting a lot of stuff back together, and the Oceania servers may take a while to kick in… what's the deal with this bull shit? I should still be allowed to play the game right? are these new updates excluding some Oceania players or is this just something to do with my computer (which is a mac btw).\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}
