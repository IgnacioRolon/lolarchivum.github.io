The system is designed that you can attain level 5 from 2 from start of season, to end, even on little play time. That said, 0 requires you dig yourself out of that first, _then_ you can start leveling it again. Not sure how long that could take.","replies":[{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2018-08-14T16:52:13.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"honor lvl 0 because i was punished late last year and was at 0 then when the season reset my honor didnt reset then i got a 10 game chat restriction earlier this year so thats how.","replies":[{"poster":"Bootleg Gay","date":"2018-08-14T19:38:47.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Okay, so why were you 0 last year???","replies":[{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2018-08-14T19:40:41.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes, i got punished for something while still honor lvl 2 (when they first introduced honor system) and basically honor lvl 0 stuck with me all the way until now","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DaenrysTargaryen","date":"2018-08-14T17:30:32.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hells bellsX,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Y51rgYkg,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-08-14T16:52:13.239+0000)\n>\n> honor lvl 0 because i was punished late last year and was at 0 then when the season reset my honor didnt reset then i got a 10 game chat restriction earlier this year so thats how.\n\nJust so you know if you were below honor 2 when the honor reset you kept your honor level, only if you were above honor 2 did your honor level reset to 2, or 2,1 2,2 or 2,3","replies":[]}]}]}]}
