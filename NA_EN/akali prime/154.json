And if i happen to do bad on that champion both my team and the enemy team flames me to the point where i want to afk. \n Im losing so many games right now its not even funny. All of the people i usually play with arent online and its really stressing me out having to try to fight through this big ass losing spree alone. i just need someone good to play with, i feel a lot better in games when im duoing with someone.","replies":[]}
