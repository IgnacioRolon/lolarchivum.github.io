Yes, they COULD make a reindeer a sol skin available year round, but it will look very out of place in the store when the rest of the skins released with it get vaulted and he stays out. Snow Day Bard is an anomaly. And I still think all holiday skins should get vaulted because they are most likely only going to sell during their respective holidays anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2017-11-20T23:20:55.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh its avaliable year round? i didnt know that, well if thats the case then your original argument is valid.\ni used bard as an example because i thought it was a legacy skin, which came after his release skin","replies":[{"poster":"My Waifu Vanilla","date":"2017-11-21T00:28:26.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's fine. Your misunderstanding further proves my point that generally people wouldn't think about a Christmas themed skin being sold outside of Christmas time.
