Now, I dont play zed a lot, However, i know that he, Strictly, Scales with Damage and CDR. While, Yes, BC Offers 20 CDR and quite a bit of good armor shred, That most of the games you build more bruiser-esque than damage, That you typically lose. \n\nTake some time and work on how exactly you want to zed, And try to make a 100% accurate step by step guide that can work for YOU.\n\nI also notice that, Despite maining AD Champs, You have a natural aptitude for AP Champs, So i suggest try playing around with other champions. Yes, Zed is a great champ to be great at, But reminder that he has a resource bar that he cant modify to playstyle, And honestly, He wont fit in a lot of comps.","replies":[{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2016-11-16T21:27:47.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the advice ill try to build a little differently but its mostly because of the tanks i go bruiser so i can kill them alot easier they usually get fed by my teams and also im working toward buying aurelion sol whos my second man","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Stealth Panda","date":"2016-11-15T00:44:01.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Read my jungle tip post. :)\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/ueyFoVp6-three-and-a-half-jungling-tips-from-a-passionate-jungle-main","replies":[]}]}
