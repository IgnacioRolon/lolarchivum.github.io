It's insanely boring to fight them because of just how bloody effective they are. They'll clear their jungle in like 2-3 minutes tops and go clear half of yours by the time you've killed Red-Raptors-Wolves. Not only that, but his ganks are great as well, with that Ice Blast slow + Stalker's Blade.\n\nAs for Singed...There's almost no good Singed players, but the crazy Singed-only mains are insanely good. They'll proxy perfectly, grab a turret or two well before 10 minutes, and never die because of R + Ghost. He just split-pushes all game and it's insanely annoying.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FaithPhel","date":"2016-12-05T10:01:55.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Leo1024,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=gUv3QFxt,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-12-04T22:23:11.210+0000)\n>\n> trynd does but singed and nunu?\n\nI logged in just to comment on this, I find that after he flips you, just walk back to the minions you were farming.

Like, unless Yasuo's winrate is so abysmal at your League that you will have a noticeably higher chance of winning without Yasuo on your team or Yasuo is so good and popular that the enemy will most likely pick him before your teammate and win with him, why not let your teammate play what he or she wants?","replies":[{"poster":"ManiacalCoyote","date":"2016-12-05T05:22:31.857+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"**(Rant directed at somebody else, not you.)**\n\nWell, when your pick intent shows up right as my index finger has depressed my left mouse button on the \"Ban\" icon, it's too late. \n\nYou knew that you needed to show your pick intent, and you waited.
