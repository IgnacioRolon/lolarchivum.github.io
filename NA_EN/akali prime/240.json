(but really simply so adcs dont get blown up every game)\r\nexample have garen prioritize between protecting a certain champion on his team, meaning he'll attack whoever is attacking that champion or not straying to far away from that champion in battle OR have him prioritize attacking the enemy (you cannot choose what champion specifically to attack because of what i stated earlier) \r\n\r\nthats pretty much all the ideas i have though, feedback welcomed.","replies":[{"poster":"hrooza dota ","date":"2019-07-03T06:28:48.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok will give my feed back for each point one by one\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Akali Prime,realm=NA,application-id=RaE1aOE7,discussion-id=eOoR3TtI,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-07-03T05:03:34.851+0000)\n>\n> 1. whenever your battling an enemy and one of your champions kills one of theirs that happens to be holding an item, have that champion drop a copy of that item apon death, if its a fully built item have them drop a piece of it that builds into said item. this will be rewarding for players who barely got to start with any items and will help them get back into the game if one of their champions manages to kill an item wielding champion. doesn't matter if that player wins or loses they will always get the item if they killed the champion.\n\nthis will just result in having worst time in the game if you dont get good items in first rounds, imagine getting out with a lone rage blade on vayne and finding everyone having a champion that is full build , feels bad right? now imagine each time they kick your ass with those items they get even more items because they beat your vayne ass multi times and get free {{item:1043}} {{item:1058}} because lol we are ahead, even worst if you had the worst luck in early stages and everyone just goes ahead and ahead because they kill each other/your champions for more items.\n\n\n> 2. make it easier to get 3 star champions. i usually like to rack up the earlier champions in the game and over the course i see they are available less and less frequently making it hard to get a 3 star champion while the enemy has two 3 star champions because they simply got better RNG. make us be able to spend gold in a different type of store so we can have a certain champion spawn to buy more often for example. \n> you need some zeds, so what you'll do is open up another store and spend 10 gold to increase the chances of a zed to appear in your deck to purchases  \n\ntheres a limited pool of each champion, so say if 7 are building garen they have hard time doing so because the limited pool hit them, your suggestion will kill the skill of adepting to what is happening in the game, i just won a game by changing my focus from nobles [because many were building garen and fiora] to full ranged comp , this is one skill that players dont focus at , adepting to what others are focusing at.\n \n> 3. champion copys should come with different abilities and combining them will give the champion more abilities to use.\n>  for example you have 3 zeds in your deck you can purchase. zed A. has his Q ability, Zed B. has W,  zed C. has E.  combining all 3 zeds will make zed have all 3 abilities he can use during a fight\n> if you have 3 zeds with only the Q ability you can still combine them and their Q will just be 3x stronger same if you were to have 2 zeds with Q and one with W, his Q will be 2x stronger with the added of being able to use W. \n> in TFT zeds W should work by him sending a shadow out that attacks enemies with him and will also copy other abilities zed cast.\n> make this for every champion. \n\nthis will result in more rng as you can get diff abilitys when you want to focus on one, besides how would a champion use all 3 abilitys if one use all his mana? it might result in just using the *wrong ability* during the fight which again increase the rng. [i cant imagine garen being in the middle of the enemy team and uses his damn Q on enemy tank instant of spining and hitting everyone].\n\n> 4. beating enemies will bring your health back up by 10 points. \n> this is just to make the games last longer, id like this to be a tense game, especially if playing in ranked. altho this may make the game last way too long.\n\nthats a bad way of fixing game damage , imo damage should be fixed on all stages and not increase over time [so higher damage early less late] right now the game is already heavy late game focused and late game end in few rounds as will and early game damage dont effect that so much imo.\n \n> 5. more xp and gold if you beat enemies stronger than you or shut down their winning streak. not sure if this is already implemented because i dont pay attention to gold gains and xp much in game but would be cool. \n\nbad idea for now, because a lot bank gold and go for late game and already beat the early game players hard enough and make their early game useless, this just make the problem worst.\n\n> 6. be able to choose your champions priorities.
