High-elo players offer a unique perspective...one that matters very little to the majority of the playerbase. Giving a very small pool of players much more power and a louder voice than everyone else is, using your logic, just as bad as claiming low-mid elo players are more relevant, and makes you seem elitist and biased against those with a less-fancy virtual medal.\n\nHigh-elo players usually only care about what affects the meta plat+. They don’t care about anything else, naturally, because they aren’t affected by any changes directed at what they consider to be the unwashed masses. Same goes for low-elo players. The difference is, there are more low-elo players, which means their opinions technically affect a larger part of the player-base than someone in high-elo.\n\nAurelion Sol may be played more in high elo, so maybe this specific example is an outlier in this regard, as high-elo opinions are more relevant in this specific context, but for nearly every other champion this isn’t the case, and one could still make the argument that riot is unfairly favoring one part of the playerbase over the other, as instead of making Sol more playable for everyone, they made him harder to use overall, forcing him into the awkward “high elo only” pidgeon-hole.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sewer Side","date":"2019-08-31T13:24:21.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I mean, if you’re going to to play the game and the champ sub-optimally, I can point out that it’s probably not just the changes that makes him feel weak to the user.\n\nNothing wrong with being silver, per say, but if you die consistently 12 times per game, have no macro sense, throw your champion into the enemy without thinking why...it’s not the changes that are the issue.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FSRER","date":"2019-09-01T16:44:48.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me tell you why it reached live.
