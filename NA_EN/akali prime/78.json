Its a transition animation from end of the Q into Passive walk (so make sure your passive is up). Aatrox has many transitions since he has 4 possible states. Another fun one you can control yourself is with ctrl+5, you can sheathe/re-sheathe the sword. He does some fun transitions when you go from sword on the back to passive stance via ctrl+5.","replies":[{"poster":"edoxbox1","date":"2018-07-05T21:11:00.127+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But the Taunt-Joke animation are broken, with the VO too, right ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"ı Sona ı","date":"2018-07-11T22:18:01.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotLamz,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bJUjEAEy,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-07-05T20:23:36.088+0000)\n>\n> That animation is in the game, it should happen after the first or second Q attack.

I wish they'd do that with Project Ashes hood, instead of making it come only when shes in jungle area/enemy side of the map","replies":[]}]}]}
