This led to me being stuck having to farm under tower all laning phase because she would move or aggro the enemy unless they got too close she would occasionally use her Q to damage enemies when they got too close or use her E to heal me but she never once used her W which is her main source of power.\r\nld just sit there and not do anything She never spoke a single word that whole game and did dumb things like if i went aggro on enemies she wouldnt do anything and just sat under tower yet she wasnt afk and moved around in one fight she ulted herself while she was at full hp and i had like only 300 hp left and needed and she let me die then she died herself. she even teleported to the back tower (the one in front of base) while she was in base and had homeguards. This player was just inhumanly dumb and did absolutely nothing to help the team at all i really need riot to look into this before she ruins someone elses game.","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2017-06-11T09:26:27.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As Ventress mentioned, reporting on  the boards doesn't get the job done.

The best (and easiest) way to ensure that Riot is made aware of a player's actions is by reporting them.  It ensures that the IFS begins to track that player's infractions, and is what will lead to them being punished and prevented from doing this sort of thing in other matches (assuming it was act rule-breaking and not just bad mechanics). \n\nIf you didn't report her, you can send in a ticket to Player Support.  They will not be able to discuss any actions taken against that player, and will thank you for taking the time to send them the information and will then look into it.  They will probably also ask/remind you in the future, to try and use the post-game lobby as much as possible, simply because of how easy, fast, and efficient it is. But if there is anything actually suspicious in that player's account, such as the use of botting programs to level up accounts, then it's possible that they may find it, and ban it in a future wave.","replies":[]}]}
