Riot tries to build a group that is a good mix of all the roles in this game (adc, support, top, mid, jungle), type (assassin, burst, utility, sustain, tank, etc), ap and ad, and \"easy\" and \"hard\" champs. That means certain champions that are more beginner/role friendly are free more often than more difficult champions that take a lot of skill to successfully utilize.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-05-15T17:21:54.986+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/oLpHlA6Z-replace-free-week\n\nMore reason free rotation just doesn't work.","replies":[{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2017-05-15T17:24:33.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"trying to make more people downvote your post is a bad idea","replies":[{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-05-15T18:48:34.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like votes matter.
