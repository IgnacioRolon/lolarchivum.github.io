Are you certain that the card is activated and has the full amount of funds on the card? \n\nSome cards need to be activated online before making online purchases, and usually the instructions are on the back of the card for how to do that. \n\nI'm assuming you've entered the information correctly and have double checked it, but that's another possibility.\n\nHow many RP purchases have you made recently? I've been locked out of purchases before for making too many purchases within a certain time frame, and had to wait a few days for it to clear before being allowed to make another purchase.","replies":[{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2017-11-07T05:02:40.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes im almost certain i activated it and did it online aswell, it has 50$ on it.\ni havent made any recent rp purchases. do you think i maybe because i have too many cards saved on my account already or maybe it could be that i tried to spend money a few mins after i activated the card maybe i shouldve givin it a little time first","replies":[]}]}]}
