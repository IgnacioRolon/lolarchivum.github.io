He's never referred to as doing such.\n\nInstead, Taric is referred to as \"Runeterra's guardian of life, love, and beauty\".\n\nSo if we're being specific, Taric is technically three Aspects in one. The Aspect of Life, Aspect of Love, and the Aspect of Beauty.\n\nAs for any other Aspects, in Ezreal's Field Notes on the official map of Runeterra, down near Paretha in Eastern Shurima, a shaman claimed that Ezreal's soul is \"entwined\" with the Aspect of the Traveller, hinting at yet another Aspect.\n\nWhile this Aspect might be someone we don't even know yet and will be revealed later on, the Aspect of the Traveller might be Bard, considering he has a connection to Targon, is known as \"The Wandering Caretaker\", and often travels a lot.\n\nAs for Leona, I don't think she's the \"Aspect of the Sun\" in the sense of her powers being from any specific sun in question, rather, I think it means she's the Aspect of Sun Magic in general, this power being granted to her by the \"Celestial of the Sun\".\n\nSame for Diana.\n\nNone of the Aspects work for Aurelion Sol. Quite the contrary, Aurelion Sol is the one that has to work for the Targonians, the inhabitants of \"The Real Targon\". They are (presumably) also the same ones that are in charge of choosing new Aspects. That, or the Celestials themselves (it's also possible that the Targonians *are* the Celestials).\n\nKindred doesn't have an \"Aspect\", and won't be able to either, as they're a spirit with no connection to Targon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Whyte Lyon","date":"2019-03-26T11:31:29.851+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the celestial aspects are the embodiment of almost any concept _you_ can think of. But looking at it from an outsiders perspective its quite difficult to follow. \n\nMost people understand that there's a couple of aspects representing abstract concepts (Justice, War, Protection). While others instead represent astronomical bodies (Sun, Moon, Twilight). \n\nBut the case is most represent both abstract concepts and astronomical bodies. The Protector is the concept of _life_ (love &amp; beauty), while also being etherial starlight. Twilight is the astronomical event of between dusk and dawn, while also the abstract concept of _change_ (apparently youth &amp; imagination too). Then we have Pantheon who represents _war_ (conflict &amp; the warrior's spirit), while also a constellation. \n\nSadly the others aren't so clear on what they fully represent. The aspects of The Sun, Moon, and Justice have no concepts attached to them, none that I can think/know of. Which I would presume they should. Neither of the Sun and Moon represents an abstract concept, while Justice has no known astronomical body. \n\nWe also have Soraka, who is one among the celestials, but isn't an Aspect by a title like the others are. She has no concept to embody nor comes from a specific part of the astral sphere. My theory is she'll someday evolve into the Aspect of the Shepherd, meaning guidance and inspiration.

The zodiac sign of Libra known as the scales represents divine justice, harmony and balance which goes with the whole theme of  {{champion:10}} {{champion:25}}\n\nIn the old lore, {{champion:89}}  was represented by her desire to protect even at the cost of her own life. She believed the Sun chose her as it's champion so she could make it up to all the fallen children in the Rite of Kor that she couldn't save which would make the aspect of the sun the real protector. I'm not sure if this is still what the sun represents with her new lore but she did show mercy to that goat boy thing which somehow proved her worth.","replies":[]}]}]}
