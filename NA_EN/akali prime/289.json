This will also help very much with your Q in laning phase because 9 times out of 10 your enemy will be standing behind minions and since ur Q is a skill shot u have to walk with to increase the range it makes landing really hard since minion blocking will delay it and give the enemies enough time to move out of the way.\n\nand a side note, with the amount of CC there is in this game since riot feels every champion needs a stun, or a knock up in their kit now. cc should not disable Aurelions passive stars because in this current meta hes unable to use them half the time.","replies":[]}
