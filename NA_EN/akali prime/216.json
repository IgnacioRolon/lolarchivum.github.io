Bcause they always make dumb mistakes or bad calls, and its not like i can sit there and type to correct them every time they do because it&#039;ll just distract me or get me killed.\r\njust got out of a game where it looked like we were going to win but then the enemy team got baron and pushed mid then the katarina on my team decided it was a smart move to try to 1v5 the baron buffed enemies after she inevitably died they pushed mid with brute force and non one could stop them and they killed all of use and just took out all our towers and destroyed nexus and won the game in a matter of seconds.\r\n\r\ni just need a duo partner please my goal is to just get to silver before the season is over,  i know its basically just bronze on steroids but at least its a start you know? please contact me i can play mid and adc, so if you main mid or adc thats fine ill just do the opposite lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Luple","date":"2017-09-29T14:58:59.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"come on man, dont blame your teams. the enemy team does just as many stupid things. you just need to practice and get better at exploiting them. also, simple things like laning in bronze and lower elos in general are a very simple thing to improve on. people make so many mistakes and dont ward. people let themselves get solo killed and people never really roam. there are so many basic things to learn at that rank, its really not fair to blame your team. they are bronze, you are bronze. everyone is bronze. its not your team's fault.","replies":[{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2017-09-29T15:31:14.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Walled Out,realm=NA,application-id=K6EGEal2,discussion-id=JE55iXFL,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-09-29T14:58:59.178+0000)\n>\n> come on man, dont blame your teams. the enemy team does just as many stupid things. you just need to practice and get better at exploiting them. also, simple things like laning in bronze and lower elos in general are a very simple thing to improve on. people make so many mistakes and dont ward. people let themselves get solo killed and people never really roam. there are so many basic things to learn at that rank, its really not fair to blame your team. they are bronze, you are bronze. everyone is bronze. its not your team&#x27;s fault.\n\ni didnt blame my team i blamed on specific stupid player that lost us the whole game, it is a TEAM game which means 9 times out of 10 you going to need you teammates to be atleast halfway decent to win the game. some games just cannot be won due to teammates making dumb decisions i can not jesus take the wheel on everyones computer and make them play better i wish i could but i cant, and its not like i can sit there typing all game to correct them because itll distract me and since we have so many snowflakes in this game id most likely be labbed as toxic. Katarina rushed into a 1v5 trying to fight a fed tryndamere with baron buff.\n there was nothing me or my team could physically do to stop her or help her without all being killed. Once she died their whole team bomb rushed mid with a shitt ton of buff minions and killed all of us in a 4v5.\n I understand what your saying that theres always something you can do better but some games cant always be won. this is one of them.","replies":[]}]}]}
