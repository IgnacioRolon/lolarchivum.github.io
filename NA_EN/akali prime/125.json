Over time she losg the ability to walk and had to become wheelchair bound. He parents soon became poor because of the cost of all her medical treatment and had to eventually move to zaun when she was 15, this is where she met ekko. Over time ekko and Ruby became good friends and he build her a pair of exoskeleton robotic legs that&#039;ll help her be able to walk again. Ekko saw how rebellious ruby was and wanted her to join his underground gang to help out homeless and runaway children and give them a home and food to eat. Ruby accepted ekkos offer to join his group and he made a few adjustmen&#039;s to her robotic legs and made them be able to run beyond normal speeds.\r\n\r\nGameplay-\r\nRuby is an ad fighter champion, that relies on speed to fight.\r\n\r\nPassive: momentum\r\nAs ruby moves around the map she gains more movement speed and as she gains movement speed it increases her ad on her next basic attack and ability. (25 second cd)\r\n\r\nQ: dashing blows \r\nRuby Impowers herself for 3 seconds and she may select up to 3 enemy champions and once she selects them you my press q again of after a 1.5 second delay she will blink to all 3 (or less) enemy champions damaging them and slowing them.\r\n\r\nW: accelerate\r\nRuby temporarily gains increased attack speed and movent speed. (Stacks with passive)\r\n\r\nE: think fast\r\nRuby targets either an ally or enemy champion then dashes towards them and knocks them back (like poppys e) if she targets an ally they will gain a small sheild and movement speed boost. If she targets and enemy they will be knocked back and take damage, if they are knocked into a wall they are stunned for 1.5 secs\r\n\r\nR: overdrive!\r\nRuby goes into overdrive slowing anything and everything around her in a big slow zone allies/enemies/abilities/moventment/ and auto attacks are all slowed significantly, while ruby can still move and use abilities at normal speed. R last 4.5 seconds. This ability gives ruby time to set up kills, save teammates or reposition.\r\n\r\nPlease tell me what you think of this concept, pictures of ruby up close are on my divantart page please check it out:)","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2017-04-21T23:55:30.522+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\ngot interested in that concept, because Zaun is my favourite faction and I always want to see what people are able to come up with as a next champion. ^^\n\nWhat I like:\n- backstory, like that she was part of Ekkos gang and how she got her legs\n- art, pretty nice drawings you made for your character, hope I see more concepts in the future\n\nStuff to think about:\nThe major problem I see in this concept is that it lacks something unique...\nLet's look at her kit. You got a passive that makes her AD scale with movement speed and a skill that increases the movement speed (for even that purpose). There is a champion in this game who already has the exact same interaction, Hecarim. His passive gives him bonus ad based on his movement speed and his E is granting additional movement speed and a knockback. Your E is basically Poppys E and your Q a Master Yi Q with target select (which could be pretty hard to use in a fast paced fight, for example teamfights).\n\nWhat I mean by that is: Your champion lacks something that really makes her unique and defines her, some kind of signature move. I think the kit could use some work. \n\nI am not sure where you think she should be played, I expect her to be a jungler right now but it seems she lacks defenses or sustain to survive there.\n\nAnd last but not least: Your art is really great, but I think her design clashes a bit too much with champions which are already in the game. Her general look is pretty close to Vi in my opinion. And the hextech enhanced legs thematic is already taken by Camille. But I really like the idea of having a handicapped champion from Zaun, you definitely should keep thinking about that.","replies":[{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2017-04-22T02:26:49.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you for your feedback and i feel like her kit design may seem familiar because of how many champions are already in the game with different champions and i feel like they're only so many unique abilities you can come up with before the game stops making sense. But i see your point 100% and i think her true uniqueness relies in her ultimate which is something never done before. \nAlso i believe she would be a good top laner/jungle or maybe even a decent midlaner, shes a diver like vi and camillie which means you build her semi tanky and ad i picture her gameplay as being the person to jump into the teamfight kill or peel whoever they need to, to set up kills and get the rest of the team an advantage in the fight.  \nBut i do love your feedback thank you so much i will be taking what you said into consideration and may make a few adjustments to her.\n\noh and the reason she seems similar to vi is because i wanted to create that (4th girl) to complete the colorful haired zaun/piltover girls \njinx(blue) vi(pink) cait(purple)  ruby(green)","replies":[]}]}]}
