So no, we can't do that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gibberwatt","date":"2016-11-22T16:25:17.920+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, chillax.  Seriously.  Just cause they banned your champ doesn't mean you can't go with someone else.  My personal favorite is that if they ban your champ, go for an off-meta champ for that role, and carry hard.  Of course, this would require that you become skilled with some harder champs, but the chat convo's you can have with the trollilng guy are just amazing.  And there's always the option of \"if you hadn't banned my main, I would be doing fine\" if you get killed a little bit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Krigjer","date":"2016-11-22T18:33:55.575+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"All these people telling you to just pick a different champion.\n\nNo. How about everyone stops being dicks to each other just to be dicks? \nI've seen way, WAY too many people say \"I don't like that champion, so you're not playing it' and they ban it. \n\nThis is DIFFERENT from a previous mentioned situation (and similar situations):\n> (contested pick and you're not first pick, for instance)","replies":[]},{"poster":"My Sea Cow","date":"2016-11-22T16:54:32.869+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"First off, you're playing normals, what do you expect? \n\nSecondly, learn to play other champions! You're really only playing 2 champions consistently and you have a 25% win rate in normals!!! I think it's time to widen your champion pool and pick up something maybe less challenging.  Focus on less mechanically challenged/beginner friendly champions instead. If you like Mid and jungle try picking Morgana, Ahri, Lux for mid and Graves, Amumu, and  Hecarim. \n\nYou should be able to play at least 3 champions per role you want to main, so 3 for primary and 3 for secondary. That way if someone bans your first pick you have 2 more to fall back on and you won't get so tilted or upset about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2016-11-22T18:26:56.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"id rather be beheaded then to play gg ez noob no skill champions NEXT","replies":[{"poster":"My Sea Cow","date":"2016-11-24T22:46:17.572+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"then you'll continue to have a 25% win rate with no growth and not improve on the game","replies":[{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2016-11-25T02:01:45.027+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"its not about winning its about having fun. :)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"catastrophicSkil","date":"2016-11-22T16:21:28.613+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"OR you could get over it and learn to play more than 1 champ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jax Cramer","date":"2016-11-22T15:24:21.009+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"If my teammates ban the champion I have hovered over I am just picking Azir and running it down mid :)","replies":[{"poster":"Akali Prime","date":"2016-11-22T18:31:28.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"ill do that for now on until riot changes that bs","replies":[]}]}]}
