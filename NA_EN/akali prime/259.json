The mini bases can only be captured 3 times to keep the game from going on forever, who ever has captured it 2/3 times will permanently own that base, rinse in repeat until your team has captured all the bases once you do that the final base to capture will be in the enemy teams tower which is lined with defenses if the losing team is able to defend for 5 minutes (maybe 10 minutes idk) the war will end in a draw and both sides will get equal points. \n\n\n**now heres the event part**\n \nduring the factions event a system will keep track on every factions win/lose rate and compare them all in a status that all players can see to see which faction are highest and lowest at the end of the month/event whatever faction has the most wins will:\n\nreward ideas:\nhave the client themed after that faction until the next event (can be turned off through settings)\nhave 5 skins awarded to 5 champions that belong to the winning faction (all players will get to vote which champion gets a skin)\nin the next faction event have the map themed after last events winning faction \nICONS! RIOT LOVES ICONS!\nand ward skins too!\nor all of the above.\n\n\nof course the gamemode will need tweaking or whatever but this is the basics, i got this game mode idea when me and a bunch of randoms choose frelijord champions in a draft game. \nfeedback please.","replies":[{"poster":"WÃ¸Oxer","date":"2018-08-03T07:20:15.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Won't work matchmaking would take too long to find players, for example I chosen Ionia and others chosen most of the time Noxus.\n\nEDIT:\n\nin case matchmaking would take longer than expected you will be forced to change factions :) which would turn into another Noxus vs Demacia event.","replies":[]}]}
