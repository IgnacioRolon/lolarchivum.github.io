So what if there was a separate ban system just for ranked so if someone racks up too many afk reports or too many troll reports they will get banned from queueing up in ranked for a few days or for maybe a week this way it&#039;ll reduce the trolls and people who afk too much in ranked to help improve ranked quality. They will still be able to play normal games just not ranked ones for a few days.\r\n\r\nim not 100% sure on where to post this idea so ill just leave it hear until a riot corrects where its supposed to be.","replies":[]}
