This is truly well deserved and I respect that. Sadly, the true hero is in a majority of the times never noticed.\r\n\r\n**I&#039;m talking about your support! **\r\n\r\nWhen your botlane goes hard &amp; destroys the enemy botlane following by snowballing the whole game securing you another win/ LP, the ADC is the one who&#039;s noticed and so to be believed to have carried the game. \r\n\r\nWe die for you, make the clutch saves &amp; sometimes we turn our &#039;_not-too-experienced_&#039; ADC into a killing machine. \r\n\r\n**It&#039;s depressing!**\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve never been too focused about receiving a honor or anything such, but after this update we supports truly get to experience being ignored for our effort. It&#039;s not about us wanting to be worshiped or noticed for everything, not at all. The whole idea of this post is that we players are being blind~ having a tunnel vision on who did what.\r\n\r\nIn the end we remain as the unkown hero (with no honor in our pockets D:).\r\n\r\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/aSVjtu7","replies":[{"poster":"Tin Obliterates","date":"2017-07-12T11:20:05.397+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always honor the player who was friendly and made the overall experience better for the whole team.\n\nAnd that person tends to be the support quite often.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KANSAS CITY STAR","date":"2017-07-12T11:35:37.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have never really allowed myself to be persuaded into doing something just because it's normal. There has always been an \"honor\" system, you could give a thumbs up on all the players in the game at the post-game screen and even had choices as to what you're giving them \"honor\" like you can now. So why in the world do I get this fullscreen popup after every game now? Really bugs me that im almost forced, but not forced, to honor someone on my team. Lots of games there are crappy players or eveen whole teams but regardless I usually click the \"not this time\" button unless there was a player that I actually enjoyed playing with or was just fun to talk to etc. I don't even like the idea of using the word 'honor' in a videogame like it's honorable to ignore your family and friends etc in order to submerge yourself into a fake world.

The team experiences the effect & results of you being fed (sometimes) because of the support and honors you.\n\nDon't get me wrong, its not about the honor- but the fact people think '_we won the game because ADC was op_' without thinking about the support.
