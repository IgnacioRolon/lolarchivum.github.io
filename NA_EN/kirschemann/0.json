My client has been slow/jerky since June, even after re-installation and even trying cortex to smooth it out for ram. I am confused as to why, as the new client had been smooth up until then. \r\n\r\nIs anyone else noticing that with each update it gets more and more problematic? Or could it be my more than adequate pc?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-17T17:38:14.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your client could be going through some stress, but it can also depend on when or where exactly it's being slow.

I have done everything possible to reduce the stress and it baffles me how it has had such a shift. It began to somewhat speed up over the micro updates that seem to happen (or whatever is occurring at those times), but in the latest patch it again dropped down to being clunky. It shows itself a lot when i attempt to access loot or the shop.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-31T15:16:56.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for following up with me, the sudden change is odd.
