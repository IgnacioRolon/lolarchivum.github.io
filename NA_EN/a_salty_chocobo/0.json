I eagerly await your pathetic attempts to justify their actions.\n\nYou know if this was anyone else they would have banned both accounts but look. He&#039;s free to be toxic on his main or a different smurf. Players who should be setting the example get special privileges .

That would require an IP ban which they refuse to do for obvious reasons. However this is a prominent figure in the scene. What's the point of banning if it doesn't do anything? They know WHO it is and they have the option to do it but they won't. Now if it was a random player they can't do anything about that for the reasons stated above. Your logic is full of holes.\n\n**Do you honestly think that means much to ban a (ex) pro's smurf account that has almost nothing on it?** This might as well not even be a punishment. He most likely has multiple smurfs AND his main account. He will continue to be toxic and Riot will continue to turn a blind eye. Nothing new here.\n\n Defender of GD? More like Defender of Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-03-11T23:50:42.545+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"That's a great strawman argument you have constructed there.

My point still stands and you have ignored it because you know deep inside the truth of my words. This player was toxic, got a perma-ban on his smurf and probably didn't even bat an eye. Here you are condoning toxicity with a circle-jerk claim. Sounds like DTN.\n\nPerhaps you should try and address what I said instead of attacking my character? I might take you seriously.

From your quote I can infer that Riot deals with these on a case by case basis and rarely bans **players**. So basically you're saying Riot COULD have but CHOSE not to. I never argued this point I was pointing out the bias of Riots decision in my original post. Tou didn't even address it and instead ignored my claim and instead attacked my character.\n\n> That's a great strawman argument you have constructed there.

This is why I rarely post on this sub-section because it's chock full of circle-jerk fanboys who don't say anything but up-vote their local hero and down-vote whoever they are arguing with regardless of how toxic/foolish their \"hero\" sound.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
