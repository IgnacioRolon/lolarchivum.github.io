I had this screensaver working for a long time, up until the new update with the BLood Moon characters, and now all I'm getting is a black screen. This persists even after I switch it to just having one image, and after I uninstall and reinstall the screen saver. Anyone have any idea what to do? I'm running this on a Windows 10 and I know it was working fine until just recently.","replies":[{"poster":"Chamelion","date":"2017-02-14T22:48:25.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definitely know there's something going on with the screensaver itself, because the only thing I actually DID get was the notification that there were new screens for the screensaver. On a black screen. So, I know that it's in the right folder and that there isn't a conflicting application in  he background.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-14T00:25:59.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is the screensaver application installed in the same folder that League resides in, or do you have it installed somewhere specific? Also, do you have any applications running in the background that could be conflicting with the screensaver? You may want to close out some apps to be sure.","replies":[]}]}
