Any \"last resort\" kind of tips ?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello,\r\nI started playing LoL in late season 5, I was placed bronze 1 and had no chance to climb further since pre-season 6 was about to kick in. In season 6, I made the mistake of maining support. My two friends who were introduced to LoL by me (top laner and ADC/mid) made it to Gold 5 by the end of the season, while I barely managed to claw my way from bronze 4 to 1. Now I got matched with players so bad I had to double my medication intake during placement games, and I promise you they are the bad ones. I can smash lane on my friend&#039;s plat unused account but in bronze support can&#039;t simply carry. My 2nd role is jungle, but everytime I try it my support is very bad (goes full AP and doesnt ward) so I find myself compelled to play the next game as support. Besides, my jungling isnt as good as my support. My overall winrate is below 50% and I&#039;m guessing I&#039;m one of the small % of players who got the short end of the stick (and it&#039;s natural because players above 50% have to exist, therefore losers exist too) I&#039;m just very frustrated with the fact that I can&#039;t do anything to help my team as support in bronze. (I do those things but bronzies dont benefit from warding and information provided like flash timers and &quot;that bush is warded dont gank&quot; etc...)","replies":[{"poster":"Myrmiron","date":"2016-12-09T22:01:55.618+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cut your life into pieces.\nHeard that works well.\n---\nhttp://fs5.directupload.net/images/161206/6ns3tse8.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Unholy Slayer","date":"2016-12-09T23:28:17.103+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Suffocation, no breathing\nI actually give a lot of f*cks of our ADC runs it down mid bleeding","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pandemic Punch","date":"2016-12-09T23:09:06.411+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No suffocation.\nAvoid bad positioning where they enemy can harass you away from CS.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"dim2a","date":"2016-12-09T19:58:19.252+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want to keep maining support, find a competent adc, and duo with them.

Back when I was Bronze 3 I thought \"Man I should be in SIlver or gold easy right now.\" Looking back, I belonged in bronze. I had to play a lot and learn from my mistakes. Season 5 it took me 500+ games to get from B3 to S4, once you start improving as a player you will climb. Season 6 i was stuck in low silver for 300 games before I finally started to climb towards Gold 5, where I ended the season. You can always get better and improve.

It took me about 35 games to get from B3 to S5. I never climbed a lot because I always got too serious in ranked and never enjoyed it. I changed that attitude and my ranked is going pretty well now.

Other people only have a stable internet connection when they visit a non-primary custody parent on Tuesday nights and every other weekend (when they might want to actually spend time with that parent).\n\nYou have to sacrifice more to reach Master than you have to sacrifice to reach Gold.

Aim for 80 by 10 minutes on a late game champ and you should be able to carry around 60% of your games. You won't always get 80 by ten minutes but this should be your aim. With this in mind your CS should be always be where it needs to be in context of the particular game. What I mean by this is that even if your don't make 80 by 10 minutes, let's say you hit 60, then your opponent might be at 20 or your 60 might be the highest in the game. I guess what I'm saying is, farm as much as possible. Learn how to do this and forget the idiots than wanna fight constantly without any thought. Fight later when you're farmed and leveled.
