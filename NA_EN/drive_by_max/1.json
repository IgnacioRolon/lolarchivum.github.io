Fiddle E doesn't really synergize with his kit like brands, which both stacks and prioritizes his passive. Veigar's wall and Thresh wall both synergize really well with their kits. \n\nThere's also the fact that fiddle is just kinda bad. His ultimate is amazing, but other than that, he has nothing going for him. \n\nYou could say, \"Oh but you can't compare kits,\" But the fact of the matter is veigar has an ability that is stronger than an ult, which is supposed to do the same exact thing. Peel or capture. They both utilize it really well, it's just stupid that veigar gets essentially a point and click \"You're dead\"(meaning the only real counterplay is an item for ap mages) and an ultimate level ability as a basic ability. \n\n> [{quoted}](name=CrazyBear1987,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=RIy28RGX,comment-id=0019,timestamp=2016-11-02T05:28:20.374+0000)\n>\n> Are you saying they should switch?\n\nSwitching would be terrible. I think veigar should have something changed, or thresh ult should feel more impactful than another champion's basic ability, which is better in almost every aspect. The only thing thresh's ult has on veigar E, is the damage it does, which tends to feel lackluster unless someone was seriously focused on collecting souls. \n\nTake a look at karthus. Now the kits aren't comparable, but he is an immobile mage, with a form of cc for the early game that isn't terrible early or late, works with his kit, and doesn't feel stupid to play against.","replies":[{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2016-11-02T07:44:35.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some champions have their power loaded into their basic abilities.

Now, his cc isn't that great to begin with, yeah, he has a pull, and it does drag people through the wall, same on E, but it's not that strong. The damage is actually bad considering how many souls a thresh player tends to get, and then basically everyone has a base of 30% magic reduction. \n\nVeigar's event horizon is much better for locking targets down.
