I had actually found that crit yi to be the most effective URF build because accelerated income meant 100% crit in like 12 minutes and no one had the chance to build enough armor to combat that before ending. Didn't actually use alpha all that much other than to dodge hard cc \n\n(edit) just watched the video.. pretty sure in a realistic scenario where there's more than one enemy nearby, just using alpha to dodge is higher dps ","replies":[{"poster":"shicky97","date":"2018-05-08T00:44:10.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it isnt really even about the DPS, his biggest weakness is getting locked down and killed but that's a tough thing to do when he gets to alpha 6 times in 8 seconds, and that's without even getting a kill reset. Also yes, it gives me URF flashbacks for that very reason, legit never being able to hit him because of almost permanent alpha strike uptime in combat.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ValiantKiller","date":"2018-05-08T00:29:33.532+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=shicky97,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7GXvkdxO,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-05-08T00:21:50.985+0000)\n>\n> That Master Yi and Jax footage in particular is giving me URF Flashbacks.

His normal On-hit build could afford to incorporate an Essence Reaver if it meant getting several more Alpha Strikes off in a single fight though, which in turn means it is harder to exploit his weakness of being CC'd and nuked because he is untargetable much more often.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-08T01:21:24.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These are using highly unrealistic attack speed, anyone trying to do this would be useless until they can get ER and multiple speed items, and useless when their ult is down.","replies":[{"poster":"shicky97","date":"2018-05-08T05:30:14.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Master Yi one, which is the one that actually looks worrying, is most likely closest to reality. His normal on-hit build will have attack speed on a similar level to the clip from the video. Also Master Yi is generally not great when his ult is down anyway, I doubt he will pick a fight without it available.","replies":[]}]}]}
