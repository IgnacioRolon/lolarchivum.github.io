Resolve is fucking pathetic.\n\nIf it's going to be the only defensive tree it should offer good defence. I don't even mind if the tree is completely devoid of utility and offensive options and it only offers straight defensive abilities outside of Grasp.\n\nThe weak utility options in the tree like Second Wind, Revitalise, Font, Demolish and Perseverance need to be worked on or just straight up replaced and the two runes which are just mathematically inferior in Iron Skin and Mirror Shell need to be replaced. We need options that will grant real durability when you take Resolve either as a splash or as a primary tree, especially since it's the only place where such options realistically exist considering Celestial Body is a complete joke.","replies":[{"poster":"Bob the Toastr","date":"2017-11-09T14:53:35.347+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.
