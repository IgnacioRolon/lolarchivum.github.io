Basically, whenever I go to play a RGM that isn't based in Summoner's Rift I get 3-9 FPS max per game. In normal games, I get 30-40 FPS, which is fine because I actually see what I am doing, etc. \r\n\r\nFor example, I experience low FPS in Ascension, but I don't experience low FPS in URF, One for All, etc. I only experience low FPS in RGMs that are not based in Summoner's Rift. \r\n\r\nEx. Ascension, Invasion, etc. \r\n\r\n{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-10T22:58:13.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is a super low frame rate, I'm sorry about that.  :(  There could be a game asset for ranked not rendering properly, or a coincidence showing up as just ranked.
