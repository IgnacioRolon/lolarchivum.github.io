It is a fact that there are a whole bunch of threads that try to farm upvotes by capitalizing on the inevitable outrage that comes with a CertainlyT design, or any other sort of controversial change, and I think we as a community need to stop giving oxygen to people who scream the loudest without saying anything of substance. However, the argument that this is a factor in any measure behind Rioters not participating here is bullshit. I have been on these Boards for years, and Riot has never participated consistently, and it is in fact their lack of participation, and poor management of their own discussion space, that has killed the productivity here. \n\nA vast amount of people posted constructive and measured threads in the past, and many still do now, only to be met with total silence. As such, it is understandable that players who made an effort to put themselves out there would be frustrated at Riot for not holding up to the promise of this space. Considering how Riot has ignored measured criticism in the past, but bent much more quickly to angry rants, especially from higher-profile people like Hashinshin, that too has pushed some players to scream a little louder, because that is the only way they feel they are going to get heard. Constructive criticism unfortunately hasn't had the biggest impact on here, whereas louder and harsher posts have had at least somewhat of a better chance in the past, which likely explains this atmosphere in part.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=AbiwonKenabi,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=s7hmnYp0,comment-id=000a0000,timestamp=2018-07-17T14:07:04.578+0000)\n>\n> OP&#x27;s main point was that average posts like this make it difficult for Rioters to comment on an actual civil discussion, hence why many refer to Gameplay as merely &quot;circlejerking posts&quot;: a term meaning posts that don&#x27;t contribute much to overall conversation, instead just receive upvotes from other players who are similarly outraged and don&#x27;t leave much room for discussion or for Riot themselves to contribute. \n\nA circlejerk on a discussion space is when people get together to pretend to have a discussion, when all they do is simply agree with each other because they already know they have the same opinion. Gameplay does have this, as does any in-game forum, but what I'm pointing out is that this thread is no different. This thread doesn't actually post constructive criticism, nor does it try to stimulate a conversation, it just tries to fish upvotes out of like-minded people who dislike the Boards. It is, in this respect, no different from the posts it attacks.

For sure, I too would have appreciated a thread that urged players to think twice before posting, and to avoid attacking the character of individuals, but that's not the aim of this thread. The very OP, right from the title, clearly tries to shift the blame for Riot's lack of communication onto the Boards community, and dumps on Gameplay with the rather obvious intent of gaining upvotes from like-minded people. That's not helpful either.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=AbiwonKenabi,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=s7hmnYp0,comment-id=000a0000,timestamp=2018-07-17T14:07:04.578+0000)\n> \n> In my own personal opinion, I think some people aren&#x27;t actually interested in an actual dialogue and just want Riot to tell them what they want to hear; furthermore, the ideas for the game of the Boards at large are generally bad, and if Riot actually listened to Boards/Reddit/Any fan forum as much as they&#x27;d like, we&#x27;d be in even worse position. Again, that last part is my personal opinion.\n\nExcept the vast majority of input given from the online community is feedback, not specific suggestions. For sure, any amateur is unlikely to come up with a viable change to a game, but players can certainly comment on how their experience feels, and this is what the playerbase has been doing. On most occasions, Riot has not heeded this feedback, even when Reddit and content creators, including many pro players, have echoed the exact same opinion, and even when Riot themselves had acknowledged a problem in the past (e.g. with overloading champion kits). The whole idea of \"Boards are terrible at X and I'm glad Riot doesn't listen to them\" is both elitist and hypocritical, since at the end of the day it implies you're only happy because the developers just so happen to be following the direction you personally enjoy. \n\nI too would love constructive discussion, and I push for this in the posts I make, but unfortunately the facts right now are that Riot simply does not participate in this space, regardless of how constructive discussions are. Right now, the net impact of constructive versus non-constructive discussions is the same, and that, coupled with the lack of moderation, only breeds more anger and resentment. At the end of the day, this is a structural problem with the Boards, coupled with a lack of two-way communication, and that is a problem only Riot themselves can fix. Blaming all this on the playerbase is utterly useless, not to mention toxic, and the fact that there are people who seem content with repeating this mistake is itself a problem to be addressed.","replies":[{"poster":"AbiwonKenabi","date":"2018-07-18T06:04:15.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While you make a valid point that perhaps the structure of the Boards is partially to blame, and obviously Riot holds their own part in the responsibility, the fact of the matter is that a developer has no obligation to follow what comes up in discussion. You are right that this is a valuable source of feedback--something that a developer should highly regard, and I believe Riot does--but its up to Riot to decide what to do with that feedback. Further, there is often feedback on both sides of an issue; for example, there's a large group that really enjoyed tank metas of the past, while there are plenty of others that hated them. What does Riot do in that situation? Ultimately, they decide for themselves on the direction they want. \n\nI by no means agree with everything Riot decides for the game, in fact I am unhappy with the general state of the game same as many others, but I recognize that personal attacks and raging comments aren't going to change that. For one, its just a game, a game that is important to me but is still just a game nonetheless. More importantly, I also know I am just one set of opinions among many, and all I can do is comment with my own thoughts. Getting angry does no good, its not entirely Riot's fault when I get angry at the game. I think players forget that they can control their own actions but they can't control others. Blaming outside forces can only take you so far: sure the Boards probably need to change in order to promote better discussion, but to just give up on civil discussion altogether? I think this is as equally unhelpful as Riot's silence. \n\nSpeaking of silence, from my perspective I think Riot keeps quite open communication. Meddler makes posts several times a week on the \"State of the game\" containing the balance team's thoughts on things while also responding to player questions, and beyond that I consistently see quite large \"Red Post Collections\" on S@20 from practically every department. I think Riot is plenty open with communication and its presumptuous to think that they need to constantly comment on every piece of feedback they receive. At the end of the day, they can't please everyone, but I think its ok to acknowledge that they've at least spoken to the community, even if you don't agree with what they've said. \n\nOP was saying \"No wonder Riot never engages with the community, these posts are not constructive\". I don't think you can deny that is what he/she was saying. Its perfectly alright to criticize Riot, that should be encouraged even, but that doesn't mean you have to condone the ill behavior of others. We should avoid \"circlejerk\" but I think its ok for a community to come to a consensus on certain things as well. I think we can all agree on things like \"Killing people irl is BAD\". That's an extreme example, but again, deciding \"constructive criticism ftw\" I don't necessarily consider a \"bad\" circlejerk. Everyone should be heard, not shouted down and we should aim for open civil discussion and avoid circlejerk. I don't think these are bad things for everyone to agree on.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-07-18T07:41:00.441+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AbiwonKenabi,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=s7hmnYp0,comment-id=000a000000010000,timestamp=2018-07-18T06:04:15.066+0000)\n>\n> While you make a valid point that perhaps the structure of the Boards is partially to blame, and obviously Riot holds their own part in the responsibility, the fact of the matter is that a developer has no obligation to follow what comes up in discussion.\n\nIf you want to go by that line of reasoning, the developer is under no obligation to do _anything_: Riot could just close their doors here and now, and they'd be perfectly allowed to do so. They could also turn League into a mobile gacha game, and would be under no \"obligation\" to avoid doing so. Neither of those, however, are likely to benefit them or their playerbase as a whole. Similarly, Riot is under no obligation to communicate with their playerbase, and that is a fact that has been apparent for some time now. However, it would be to their _benefit_, and to ours as well, if they did participate more, particularly since their lack of communication has had a clear negative impact on their game and its reputation.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=AbiwonKenabi,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=s7hmnYp0,comment-id=000a000000010000,timestamp=2018-07-18T06:04:15.066+0000)\n>\n> Further, there is often feedback on both sides of an issue; for example, there&#x27;s a large group that really enjoyed tank metas of the past, while there are plenty of others that hated them.

The tank meta just so happens to be a point where many people on here accept that there are disagreements, due to the difference in pacing people prefer.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=AbiwonKenabi,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=s7hmnYp0,comment-id=000a000000010000,timestamp=2018-07-18T06:04:15.066+0000)\n> \n> I by no means agree with everything Riot decides for the game, in fact I am unhappy with the general state of the game same as many others, but I recognize that personal attacks and raging comments aren&#x27;t going to change that.\n\nHashinshin's rage-fuelled video rants are unfortunately the most impactful piece of community feedback in a very long time, while civil discussion remains ignored. It is therefore unsurprising of others to act the same. I personally hate the toxicity in this space as well, and I think it needs to change, but then Riot needs to show that they value civil feedback, instead of simply bending to whoever screams the loudest on the rare occasions where they do take in player feedback.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=AbiwonKenabi,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=s7hmnYp0,comment-id=000a000000010000,timestamp=2018-07-18T06:04:15.066+0000)\n> \n> Speaking of silence, from my perspective I think Riot keeps quite open communication.

Do you see any part that takes in player feedback? Do you see any substantial questions receive proper answers, such as the state of damage in the game? What about long-term plans and design principles that aren't just vague announcements for the next patch? At the end of the day, Riot sure talks _at_ the playerbase, but doesn't at all do a good job of talking _with_ them, and what they do say is frequently contradicted in the next patch, or the one after.

It attempts to blame Riot's lack of communication onto the playerbase, which is not only toxic, but patently untrue. Riot has been lacking in communication regardless of quality of discussion, and even now constructive threads continue to be entirely ignored. I can agree that toxic threads are bad, but they are not the reason why Riot has not been communicating with its players. We can definitely encourage each other to be better, and to avoid bashing each other for our differences in opinion, but that is different from blaming an entire group of people for something they didn't do. Doing so is also disrespectful to the people on these Boards who genuinely do try to be constructive, who still remain ignored, and who get bashed by ignorant posts such as these nonetheless.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MalrothDragonia","date":"2018-07-17T14:26:28.083+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"^^^^^ THIS SO MUCH.

With that said, though, I do think there is room to criticize specific developers, though that criticism needs to come from a place of honesty and constructive intention. When a developer makes the same kind of mistake repeatedly, it is worth pointing out that trend, and to some extent it is more understandable for players to feel frustrated about a developer than about another player. In this particular case, CertainlyT has definitely made some mistakes in the past, and this new design of his has the hallmarks of some of his more frustrating designs, so that in itself is worth pointing out. Is it worth insulting his person? Certainly not. Does that mean we should cease criticism of developers altogether? I don't think so either.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-07-17T20:43:09.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I wasn't saying criticism shouldn't be made, I agree with you that criticism is important.\n\nBut it's important to make the distinction, soapboxing about incompetence and chanting for heads on pikes are not valid forms of criticism.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-07-17T20:50:55.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a general rule, if someone does do a particularly poor job and refuses to improve, that is grounds for firing them.

In this respect, I agree that we should definitely stop with that. However, as mentioned above, this should not mean deliberately ignoring trends and repeated negative patterns, so if a developer does appear to repeat the same mistakes, that is worth bringing up as well. Part of the problem here is that CertainlyT is largely perceived as having had a detrimental impact upon the game, and for refusing to change, so while that still does not really justify wanting to end his livelihood on a whim, it is understandable that some people would not want him designing on the game they care about.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
