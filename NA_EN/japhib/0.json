I&#039;ve read most of the stuff you guys have online, including the &quot;Day in the Life&quot; article about the software dev from Hong Kong, the Riot dev blog, and the various open job descriptions. I have a few more questions, though:\r\n\r\n(A. Intro, how long have you worked there? What does your team do? What technologies do you work with?)\r\n\r\n1. How often do you actually play League during work hours?\r\n2. What&#039;s the coding culture like? Does it &quot;feel&quot; like a big company where you&#039;re a just a cog and there&#039;s lots of red tape, or does it feel smaller where you have more freedom but also more responsibility? Or maybe it&#039;s a mix?\r\n3. How free are you to experiment with new technologies?\r\n4. How often do you find yourself working evenings/weekends, and how much of that could you avoid if you didn&#039;t want to? Are you on-call and is it required for most dev teams to be on-call?\r\n5. What are some of the more important non-technical aspects of a new hire that you look for in interviews &amp; resume reviews? (If you do that sort of thing)\r\n6. What are some nice things about being a dev at Riot Games, and if you feel comfortable, what are some not-so-nice things you&#039;d change if you could?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance! You guys rock, the game rocks, don&#039;t let toxic Boards-ers keep you down, and keep up the good work!\r\n\r\nEdit: My post was removed from the subreddit because it addressed only Rioters instead of all LoL players. But I can't figure out how to remove the link, so we're going to go ahead and ignore it!","replies":[]}
