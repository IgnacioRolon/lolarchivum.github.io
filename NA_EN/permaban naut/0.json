That sent me over here to the forums in a hurry. I do use this feature and want either it or a full, well-supported replacement to exist in the new client. Time to up-vote everything related to this and push Riot towards either supporting it long-term or supporting an open-source 3rd party version that will be just as good and just as consistently supported.\n\nPlease, Riot?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kveldolf","date":"2016-10-26T02:23:42.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The item set and changes are super helpful i don't want to be forced to memorize every champs best build or have to write it down you have a nice and convenient set up don't  waste it {{item:3151}} {{item:3151}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-18T17:36:14.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think Item Sets are active on the alpha client yet.
