This gave me a bad game experience because many time my client crashed in loading page and system just judge me as AFK and put me in lower priority queue.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-22T23:08:51.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Random crashes with the client are often caused by your client losing its connection to the game platform service. These are often the result of local network settings that conflict with League. I recommend working through the steps in our [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure these settings are all up to snuff.\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change.","replies":[{"poster":"Arianrhod","date":"2016-09-24T09:36:24.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My problem is that it crashes and not responding in the main page (not in the game).

Your troubleshooting guide doesn't help for shit in any case that I've ever had, had issues with your staff all the time, nobody being able to help me when needed, nobody knows what's wrong and you always suggest me use those useless guides.
