Just today I've dropped 15 lp, I haven't lost a match, or dodged a game, my client has crashed twice though in a ranked lobby, I currently have a 30 minute leavebuster for no real reason other than Riot felt like this. I'm expressing my concern not only for how common the crashes are but how we're punished, lack of good support means we can't really tell anyone but the forums about it. And it really blows my mind that they haven't implemented a way to join a lobby back after a change, if I'm the 5th person to lock in and it crashes after bans I should be able to join the lobby back cause my friends are still in it, but no, we have to wait for everyone to log in, for it to get to me, and for it to countdown, then we have to wait out the leavebuster and try to make up in lp. It's frustrating, it's wasting my time, and it's causing me to derank.\r\n {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-31T23:48:22.443+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Disconnections, crashes, or delays in champ select often happen where there is a poor or unstable connection to the server.

A lot of people have been getting client crashes lately. I think it's related to memory usage getting extremely high and then the client stops responding.","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-08-01T03:10:07.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of the client crashes are a result of poor connectivity, corrupt game files, out of date operating systems and such.","replies":[{"poster":"Lucifer","date":"2016-08-01T03:55:51.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rineyy,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=9HgaeZFF,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2016-08-01T03:10:07.046+0000)\n>\n> Most of the client crashes are a result of poor connectivity, corrupt game files, out of date operating systems and such.\n\nNot recently.

The client literally freezes because it's sucking up too much memory and forces you to close and re-open it. There's no internet problem related to it.","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-08-01T15:14:04.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's the memory usage % when they're in champ select?
