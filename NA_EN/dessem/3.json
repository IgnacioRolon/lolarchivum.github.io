There&#039;s more, but when I think of &quot;champion who really needs their ult&#039;s CC to make a teamfight impact&quot;, these are the champions I think of.\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s make one thing clear: I really do not mind that QSS is being changed so that it can no longer cleanse debuffs like Malzahar&#039;s Malefic Visions, or Trundle&#039;s Subjugate, or even Zed&#039;s Death Mark. If before these debuffs were balanced around a QSS Cleanse, it means that should open up space to make these debuffs less impactful. After all, Trundle will have no counterplay against his ult. He uses it and you&#039;re fucked and have to disengage the fight, which is rough with Trundle&#039;s powerful slow, and chasing power.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll have faith you will adjust it.\r\n\r\n**HOWEVER**, if the reasoning is that it&#039;s not fair for these debuffs when you can erase their effect with the click of a button... then please do consider the above champions. Their ults are a high moment. In the case of Warwick and Amumu, it&#039;s almost the only high moment permitted in their plays. QSS still negates those.\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;re going to say it isn&#039;t fair for Zed to have counter-play against his ult&#039;s marking, then I&#039;m going to say it isn&#039;t fair that Warwick can be rendered completely useless with the click of a button either. Either they can both have their point-and-click ult rendered useless by QSS, or neither should.\r\n\r\nPlease draw one line here.","replies":[{"poster":"ArlanKels","date":"2016-04-20T17:07:23.682+0000","up_votes":44,"down_votes":4,"body":"I believe this is all about making it easier to balance certain champions....but I might be insane.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2016-04-21T01:27:03.979+0000","up_votes":77,"down_votes":19,"body":"This is pretty much the point, and admittedly, it's a difficult sell.

The problem in season 6 so far is that multiple problems are being put into the game at once because they essentially have to live test (or so they feel) multiple things. IT was like preseason, stacking multiple things and trying to get them all good at once.\n\nIt caused so many problems, op champs (for a while at least), the masteries are STILL being fixed, and so on. It is looking like the same situation. So yes, 100% you can only tackle one problem at a time, but maybe then only implement one problem to solve, instead of 6, when you can only fix one, and are testing it against items, jungle changes, champs, etc all at once.

Just let your other teammates take them down and focus a squishier target.\n\nHonestly, I feel like QSS is an item you can make extremely useless to a player mid to late game when team fights are happening.\n\nSo honestly, I agree.  The changes to QSS were unneeded and should be reverted.  If you're smart, you'll just avoid fighting that champion unless you know it's down.\n\nAnd honestly, my honest opinion in the changes, is that they're doing it so their second LCS baby (First baby being Lee) will stay current in the meta, and still see tons of competitive play, with the changes to mages.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BigPooStorm","date":"2016-04-20T21:52:28.386+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":5,"body":"It's unfair to counter a champion with a click of a button... \n\n{{item:3155}} {{item:3156}} \n\nDoesn't even require a click of a button.

Sona at least has some utility, but if Amumu or Seju flub their ult or don't have it available, what they can do is limited. Amumu chiefly has very little appreciable impact without his ult.","replies":[{"poster":"kile147","date":"2016-04-20T17:55:32.186+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"If they land a good ult then it's still useful because only their adc is free and you've got the rest of the enemies cc locked.
