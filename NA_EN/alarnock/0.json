I&#039;m fine with her being able to invis even under turrets, but give me a fucking chance to do some damage back and punish her aggressiveness.\n\nLiterally the only option at this point is to run away, and hope you kill her before her 8.5 second shroud is back off cooldown.","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-10-08T01:14:43.490+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's a poorly designed ability because it allows Akali to only fight on her terms. In a teamfight it isn't bad, because if she sits in it she can't do anything, but in lane it's just oppressive. It's just way too powerful for a basic ability imo, it basically prevents you from being able to outplay her(a common trend in new/reworked champs), and if that wasn't enough she has like 2-3 dashes in her kit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2018-10-07T21:14:18.247+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"Walk away from it.\n\nSuddenly it has lost every bit of it's power.\n\nNow you go back in after it's dissipated and her one defensive and utility ability is on a 20 second cooldown.","replies":[{"poster":"MarkedOfKane","date":"2018-10-07T23:46:39.960+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AvantelWings,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=UeiaxFFd,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-10-07T21:14:18.247+0000)\n>\n> Walk away from it.\n> \n> Suddenly it has lost every bit of it&#x27;s power.\n> \n> Now you go back in after it&#x27;s dissipated and her one defensive and utility ability is on a 20 second cooldown.\n\n*Walk away*\n*No longer under your tower*\n*She kills you*\n\nAlternatively she just stalls you out and you cant kill her, you get ganked etc","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2018-10-08T00:03:45.401+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"so she follows you through one tower, leaving her only defense, into another tower.

If she dives you, she can sit under tower with you safely and kill you, if you try to just run away, you are no longer under the safety of your tower and she can just jump you there.\n\nSure you come out ahead, but she can just heal herself or poke you from inside the shroud if you want to stick around for farm and she has plenty of mobility to just back up if she needs to. What I meant by stalling is that shes potentially untouchable for what, 6 seconds? Giving the typical benefits of that such as refreshing all her cooldowns or having her jungler/team arrive to the fight and so on.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"5h4Dovv","date":"2018-10-07T22:33:18.792+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AvantelWings,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=UeiaxFFd,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-10-07T21:14:18.247+0000)\n>\n> Walk away from it.\n> \n> Suddenly it has lost every bit of it&#x27;s power.\n> \n> Now you go back in after it&#x27;s dissipated and her one defensive and utility ability is on a 20 second cooldown.\n\nIt is immune to turret detection, and she have too much mobility already to justify this level of kiting/defensive/towerdiving ability.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alarnock","date":"2018-10-08T02:54:40.382+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"The cd on it gets absurdly low, iirc last time i played her.. with 10% cdr I had an 8.5 second cooldown on it at max rank, and it isn't much more otherwise... maybe 16 second at level 1","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Love Anastasia","date":"2018-10-07T21:23:42.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"It has counterplay: The time.\n\nAlso, it has another hard counter: Permaban her as I do while I pray to CertainlyT getting fired","replies":[{"poster":"Sharpest glasses","date":"2018-10-07T22:31:31.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Your main is same as CT creations, no joke.","replies":[]}]}]}
