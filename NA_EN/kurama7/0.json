Its no fun playing the game and having 3-5 of the enemy team members all in call with each other talking about what to do when its me and 4 random people having to communicate through pings it creates such an unfair advantage and makes it so i don't want to play the game. If we don't get a solution to DQ soon i will stop supporting Riot, no more watching lcs on their youtube/twitch etc i'll use others who upload afterwards so riot isent being supported by me and i suggest everyone else do the same until this problem is fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"Kurama7","date":"2016-06-22T03:06:19.337+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just had a game where they had 3 man premade and we had all 1 man team. On top of that it seems that i will randomly get people on my team who are just so far down in elo compared to everyone else that it makes no sense to have them, like having a silver 3 on my team against a team of full gold 1-plat 5's, its an auto fed lane for whoever they are against.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-06-22T02:27:19.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This almost never happens (look at the stats riot posted on this very topic about a moth ago). Premades are matched against premades of the same size in virtually all games, and a 4-man is NEVER matched against 5 random solos.\n\nWhy blame bad games/teams on DQ?","replies":[]}]}
