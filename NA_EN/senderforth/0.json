HELP.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is so stupid, so my game wouldn't let me attack monsters as i was playing jungle, and sometimes didn't even let me see them. So after a few minutes of gameplay, I had to exit and reconnect. then it wouldn't show up to \"Reconnect\" as it usually does... So then i exit the league client and then I log back in and it says \"Authenticating\" for literally 20 minutes, I decided to do my homework and I had league open, then later I checked AND STILL, NOTHING. Today, I got back on and I GOT A LEAVERBUSTER FOR 20 MIN. 5 TIMES!?! WHAT? How do I get punished for something that wasn't my fault? It wasn't even my internet, I checked so many times and it was league's fault for not logging me innnnn. I'm not taking this leaverbuster... I'm just not. I'm not accepting it man. Help me out cuz this is gonna piss many more people off. Take this leaverbuster off my SenderForth account.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-28T22:59:37.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it sounds like you couldn't attack those jungle creeps or get reconnected because your connection was having problems. You got the Leaverbuster since you left the game and never reconnected. Regardless of whether your network was letting you back on, your teammates game was still affected from you not being there. You're welcome to reach out to us in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to see about getting this reduced, but I'm not entirely sure how likely that's going to be.","replies":[{"poster":"SenderForth","date":"2017-09-29T05:42:21.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for paying attention to this and taking the time to help. I think that's cool that you can give 'tickets' out like that, and I did submit my issue. But it just seems like most of the time, my connection is fine and when it's not, I definitely can recognize it, and there's nothing I can do about it when it says \"Reconnecting\" and I check to see my internet status and it's perfectly normal. Also, I didn't leave or even acted in an unusual or hurtful way to anyone and it's hard to remember when I even knew I'd get in trouble in some way so I have no idea why I would get a leaverbuster after this one single game.","replies":[]}]}]}
