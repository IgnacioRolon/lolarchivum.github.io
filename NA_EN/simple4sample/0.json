It happens completly randomly where it happens usually once every day. The freeze makes the whole PC freeze; the sound, cursor, game and every other program I have running. It began one month ago. I monitored this while it was happening with Open Hardware Monitor but I could not see any issues. Everything was running as normal. Any thought about this? {{summoner:3}} {{item:3151}}","replies":[{"poster":"Max Last Breath","date":"2017-08-16T13:01:45.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think it's fair to say that it still exist ;) been happening for a long ass time...

Drivers are a lot quicker to check and easier to fix so let's start there. Check out this [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) and follow the other steps as well, and let me know if that helps at all!","replies":[{"poster":"Simple4Sample","date":"2017-06-25T11:10:02.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, after two weeks I can say that the issue is still not fixed.
