Jungle is just awesome, and I'm awesome at it. I currently have 6786 IP and I have Yasuo and Vel'Koz.

He's also a better counter jg and (arguably) has better ganks. Both end up being fairly tanky.\n\nThey both have interesting kits, though I would argue that Rengar's is more versatile. He also comes with the possibility of **The Hunt is On** to trigger :p.  However, it's more difficult to utilize correctly and he takes more time to master.\n\nSo what's your pref? I play both, though I prefer Vi...mostly because I'm still not that good at managing Rengar's 'Ferocity'. They're both great picks, especially in the current meta. It really just comes down to playstyle and theme.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-02-23T00:56:26.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I bought {{champion:254}}, one of the best choices I have made.\n\nShe has decent sustain in the jungle, her pre-6 gank are great, and her level 6 ganks are almost always guaranteed kills.\n\nShe can build one damage item and the rest tank, she functions quite well as a tank in that her skills lead her to being in the middle of fights, so she draws the focus of the enemy team and can still survive while your team cleans up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kokopelli2","date":"2015-02-23T00:46:57.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Neither buy {{champion:266}}!\nBut if i had to chose get Vi.","replies":[]}]}
