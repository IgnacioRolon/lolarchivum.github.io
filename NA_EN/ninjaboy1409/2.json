I left before Kindred came out. After coming back, I tried logging in but the account password was changed, which was weird because I never received any emails saying for a request. After changing my password, I see this screen where it said I was permabanned, and I don&#039;t recognize the chat was given to me before I was banned. I don&#039;t know if it is possible but can you unban my account?","replies":[{"poster":"jwn8175","date":"2016-08-21T05:48:10.512+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably someone hacked your account and acting ridiculously toxic on it.

But I wouldn't get your hopes up too much, account security is on the account owners head. Might be a chance that they reverse it if you can prove it wasn't you. Good luck with your account.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Urf Mode Is Life","date":"2016-08-21T02:36:18.192+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"riot only wants your money, they dont give a fuck about you","replies":[]}]}
