Its also not that difficult to find a location. We would accept any ping below 80, it would be a huge difference to how we play currently with 120ms- 150.\r\n\r\n**Language**- We dont all speak Arabic. Most of us do, but not all of us. You need to consider countries like UAE where a huge amount of people dont speak Arabic, and all countries have different \"types\" of Arabic. For example, People in Egypt dont speak the same as locals in UAE.\r\nMy point- IF you were to add an Arabic language, make sure to still include the regular English in the options.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you eventually implement such server, it will certainly be filled with players within days. Tournaments will be made more often (Riot-less and *fingers crossed* Riot authorized) and League will become a much bigger deal here than it is currently.\r\nIm just giving an idea, I really hope you decide to implement a server at some point. {{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-09T21:59:16.660+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've got some pretty decent points here, but sadly I don't have much of a say in new servers =\\ .
