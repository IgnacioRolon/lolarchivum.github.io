No one has ever said that. But as of right now AP items cost A LOT more gold 500 extra for zhonya, 300 for rabadons, etc.. this is a big deal...What's worse? this mastery system sucks goat crap direct from the asshole for APC's. Tanks and bruisers are in an even worse position... 1300g for anti-armor anti-health tanks. Tank items also cost more, so the value of armor/health has degraded SIGNIFICANTLY since last patch. I don't think you truly understand the tank and bruiser nerfs.. wait until more ppl realize it and capitalize on it","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-11-12T07:57:13.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"BT costs an extra 500g, BotRK costs another 200 and got nerfed, the 1300 item you're talking about is actually near garbage tier unless the tank has more than double his base armor as bonus armor and even then, a Cleaver beats it out by itself.... \n\nY'all need to quit the circlejerk. You get 80-100 base armor at max level that an ADC can't ignore anymore and that's 40-50% reduction by itself. To say tanks and Bruisers got nerfed is like saying ADCs are worthless now because IE gives 15 less AD, BT has 5 less AD and costs 500g more, and BotRK took an arrow to the knee. lol.","replies":[{"poster":"iTziLLiRL","date":"2015-11-12T08:02:13.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"there are more factors like mastery. no 5% additional AP, no flat AP bonus, no % dmg bonus from 21 pts there are os many factors, but really no one can deny that tanks and bruisers are in a worse position today than yesterday","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-11-12T18:56:19.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tanks and bruisers are in a wonderful position right now since most of them have a base of 80-100 armor. That's 40-50% damage reduction that ADCs and other AD based carries can NOT ignore anymore. Before, with a LW, you ignored about 40% of TOTAL armor with the mastery. That meant you could cut into their base armor if they had more base than bonus, which isn't hard if you only have 1 armor item. Now, Tanks and Bruisers can grab up a Randuin's and Ninja Tabi and cut an ADC's DPS harshly and because you only have a bonus of 90 armor, a LW won't even do much. Seriously. That 40% LW will cut your 170 total armor down by 36 because it'll cut it based on your BONUS, not total.\n\n170 is about 63% reduction. 134 (Minus 36) is still 57.6% reduction. 5.4% change! Before, you went from 170 to 103. 103 is barely over 50%. This is on top of tanks and bruisers now getting 200% health regen when low on health, gaining 8% more from shields and heals and other regens, and a choice between 300 free bonus health or 4-8% reduced damage taken on top of it all.\n\nMost MAGES are also in a pretty good spot with the Deathfire keystone and the 2.5% damage increase against CC'd targets. Most mages use CC as part of their combo and it also means 2.5% against SLOWED targets, so a Rylai's also increases your damage. So whereas before you had 5% bonus AP, so your 225%ish average combo ratio was increased by 5% because of that and then by another 3% from the last mastery, you now have 2.5% increase and you gain 20% on your combos. If you have a DoT in your kit too, you do close to 40% of your AP added onto your 4s DoT with Deathfire.\n\nIs there a lack of good keystones for Mages? Yes. There's also a lack of good keystones for AD Casters since Deathfire does MAGIC, Fervor only affects AA's and takes TEN stacks to be noticeable, Stormraider's is almost purely snowbally, and Thunderlord's Decree is near worthless late game, especially since it does magic damage, then left there's Warlord's and that's for ADC's plus Tryn and Yas.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"iTziLLiRL","date":"2015-11-12T07:08:00.665+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"you guys fail to understand all the details. probably didnt even read notes. typical children. Tanks got screwed so hard, bruisers got screwed so hard.. and AP champs got screwed so hard. do you understand how important bruisers and tanks play in the game? if they want to change tanks and bruiser meta they're going to regret it. when you see a game with 4 ad casters or adc's and a support... and team fights go on for like 5 seconds cuz everybody getting 1 shot... and it takes very little skill and critical thinking yeah you got a fckn problem. tanks and bruisers play an important role in the game. they stall out fights, zone, annoy, peel and many other factors.. when AD casters and ADC's are this powerful that building armor/health items cost a shit load of gold(same as dmg items) FYI you probably dont realize this but dmg stats have a higher gold worth meaning dmg items are typically more expensive.. now this isn't the case. tank items are fucking expensive and tank junglers are in a SHITTY fckn place right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Ooh im Edgy","date":"2015-11-12T07:24:18.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"do support u bruh. much agree-mints, very yes.","replies":[]}]}]}
