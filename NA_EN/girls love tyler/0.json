I own it.\n\nAgain, no. You own nothing.\n\n> Riot doesn’t own it because it wasn’t free on their behalf, it was my money.\n\nAgain, no. Below is as close to a complete answer that I can give you. All of this comes from[ section 4 of the ToU](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse#virtual-goods)\n\n> # 4.1. What kind of “virtual goods” can I access in the Game? (You can unlock access to champions, skins, emotes, accessories, etc.)\n\nLet's see, you access virtual goods created by Riot\n\n> When using the Game, you may “unlock” and gain access to various in-Game virtual goods (“Virtual Goods”) associated with your account, including:\n\nA second time? Access, not purchase\n\n> You can access these Virtual Goods in at least one of three ways:\n\nThere it is again, \"access\", not \"purchase\". Let's dive deeper\n\n> 4.1.2. With Riot Points.  Every player with a valid, active account may participate in our “Riot Points” service offering, which is a redeemable point system that operates like virtual currency.\n\nHmm, \"like\" virtual currency. It isn't currency, it is just like it.\n\n> Riot Points can be purchased online through the in-Game store or at retail in the form of a prepaid “Riot Games Game Card.”\n\nFirst instance of purchase in the entire section. Nothing about buying skins, champions, etc. The only thing you purchase is RP.\n\n> You can use Riot Points to unlock and acquire access to certain Virtual Goods (e.g., boosts, champion skins, ward skins, and new champions).\n\nLook at that, you don't use RP to \"buy\", you use it to \"unlock\". it gets even more explicit in the next part\n\n> # 4.3. Do I “own” the Virtual Goods I unlock? (No. What you “unlock” is not the virtual good itself, but rather, a qualified right to access it in the Game.)\n\nWait, did it just say that you don't own it? Yep. They go more into detail in the legalese.\n\n> You have no ownership or other property interest in any of the Virtual Goods you unlock, regardless of whether you acquired access to those Virtual Goods using Riot Points, Blue Essence or Hextech Crafting. \n\nThat is pretty damn explicit. especially the first part of the sentence: \"You have no ownership\". But can you get any money back for virtual goods?\n\n> Virtual Goods have no monetary value. You can’t redeem them for cash. \n\nSay what? The stuff you *unlocked* is monetarily worthless? Yes, that is exactly what they say.\n\n> You can’t obtain any refunds for purchasing Riot Points or Virtual Goods, except as expressly permitted by us.\n\nSo, unless they expressly say that you can have a refund, you are not entitled to a refund. They even provide a link to their [refund policy](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751864-Content-Refund-FAQ)\n\n> 4.4. Once again: I don’t own these Virtual Goods? (“No!” shouted all the lawyers.)\n\nIt must be pretty damn important, if they feel the need to repeat that.

Once you break the rules, you are no longer allowed to use it and you don't get a refund for breaking rules you agreed to. You agreed to this when you made your account. Your account is theirs to do with as they see fit and they can stop service whenever they want for whatever reason they want. Again, you agreed to this when you made your account. You and Riot have an agreement, you follow the rules and you get to use their services, you can even pay for extra flair if you want.... Idk how many times I should put the word \"agree\" in here, but hopefully its enough for you.  \n\nBesides, what is the point of letting you transfer all of your stuff if they perma-banned your account. They are basically saying \"unless you reform, go away.\" so why would they want you to keep making accounts without any real punishment?   \n\nalso I remember your previous posts, you clearly don't understand the difference between having a bad game/making a mistake and being too toxic to be allowed to play the game anymore. You were bumped up to permaban really quickly because you clearly didn't get the memo with the 14-day suspension.","replies":[]},{"poster":"comedybingbongs","date":"2018-09-12T14:28:10.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is that Riot sees it as you renting the skins. As soon as your account is banned, your rental period is over. \n\nNow, this shouldn't necessarily be an issue. People are familiar with the concept of renting. People rent a tux for prom, people used to rent movies from blockbuster, etc. The problem, though, is that Riot has made the client and the shop look and feel like a regular online store. Like amazon or something like that. They have purposefully *not* recreated the atmosphere of a renting. So when players get banned, it feels like stuff that they bought and own is being taken from them. \n\nSo yes. Riot can point to some ToS bullshit that nobody actually reads. So can the Riot fanbois who occupy these threads. And they are absolutely correct. Howvever, Riot knows what they are doing when they design the client to feel like you are buying something and not renting it. \n\nTldr: Riot should make the store feel more like you are renting something than buying something. This would be the honest move.","replies":[]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-09-10T03:45:52.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But in the terms and agreements, you agreed that you don't own anything, you just get the access for it.\n\nand by agreeing to the ToS, you agreed that.\n\nya.\n\ntheres a prose i wrote 5 years ago.\n\n\"you should have read the terms more carefully.\"","replies":[]}]}
