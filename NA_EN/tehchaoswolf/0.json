I never restarted my computer after that, but a wondows 10 update came through and forced a restart, Since then, both Search UI and Skypehost are back up and running. I have disabled them through the task manager to no avail. This eats my CPU usage and causes my FPS to drop to 1-10 fps, instead of my normal around 60. My ping is fine, and I have replicated this issue at another house to make sure it wasn't just my internet. I cannot find the article with the command prompts anymore, and was wiondering if anyone knew how to solve this issue or permanently close these programs so I can play again?","replies":[{"poster":"Wolfearent","date":"2017-02-12T19:34:56.885+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having the same issue!
