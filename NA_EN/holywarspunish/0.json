Or have their price reduced. come on is that dificult to answer us?\r\n\r\nive asked this question couple of times but nobody gives a straight answer. I know they are old and at that time Riot had a different quality for those tier skins but as times passed on they became useless and unfun.. but the worst is that they are still sold as 1820 rp skins. It just doesnt follow accordingly with the tier skin rules no??\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you give them updates dear rito?\r\n{{champion:20}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-16T23:56:08.103+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"At this time, we don't have plans to update older legendary skins.","replies":[{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2015-12-18T11:59:33.711+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Question: with all the absolutely awful splashes from 2009/2010 that are still around, why was Hade Dragon Wu remade... as just a slightly chubbier, oilier and messier version of the old splash?
