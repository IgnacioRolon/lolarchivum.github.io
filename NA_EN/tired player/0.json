I installed the drivers for my graphics card and all the things that came with downloading league, but when I stream my fps is 30-60, while it&#039;s supposed to be around 55-90.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m on the exact same settings in League as I was before I reset my PC. Same stream settings aswell. I feel like I&#039;m missing some kind of program or driver that I didn&#039;t think of....\r\n\r\nThank you for your time","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-15T21:10:16.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you reset your PC, there could still be outdated drivers or products.  Make sure to update Windows, and if you already did then make sure to also disable the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html).  It's auto-enabled and has been known to cause fps and even freezing issues for some players.  Make sure to also go over each step of the [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide to tune things up.
