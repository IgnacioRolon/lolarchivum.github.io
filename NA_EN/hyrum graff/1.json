I'm seeing this on the desktop browser as well. I'm fairly certain it wasn't like that a week ago.  I'll let the dev team know. Thanks!\n\nEdit: Actually.... nevermind. Those specific Rioters just happened to be posting in the same thread in a very short span of time. I'll try to confirm this.","replies":[{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2015-01-12T22:33:14.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah. One way to know is going to the posts themselves and see if the red posts matches the amount on the red tracker.","replies":[]}]}]}
