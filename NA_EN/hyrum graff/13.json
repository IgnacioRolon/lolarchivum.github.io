Making each of them weaker in some areas lets you make them stronger and more interesting in other areas, which makes them more unique and hopefully increases the diversity of marksmen who see play.\n\n#Why do adcs in their current form exist?\n\nThere&#039;s really 3 parts:\n\n**Seige:**\n\n- League absolutely needs a class which takes towers quickly.\n  - Otherwise we get an endless stall-fest.\n- This class probably needs to be ranged, otherwise taking towers becomes *way* too risky, and again we get a stall-fest.\n- This class needs to have good single-target dps.\n  - The alternative would be, they can deal burst damage to towers.\n    - This is not really a healthy mechanic because you get the same amount of damage off whether or not the enemy is defending. It might be able to work on a melee tower-taking champ, but as mentioned before, melee cannot take towers \\*reliably\\*, so they&#039;re out.\n\n**Objective Control**\n\n- Any class with good single-target dps will naturally be good at taking neutral objectives.\n- Autoattacks are naturally made to deal good single-target dps.\n  - If you change that, you&#039;re pretty much making a new game.\n\n**DPS to champs / teamfight / late game:**\n\nI&#039;ll be frank. I see no reason why every marksman is REQUIRED to have insane late-game scaling. The reason why they DO have it is because AA damage is 100% tied to items.\n\n- This seems to be a place where marksmen could differentiate themselves.\n  - Champs like MF, Graves can get their damage moved out of insane AA scaling and into their damaging abilities. Less dps, but still cooler.\n  - Champs like Vayne, Kog&#039;Maw can keep their insane AA scaling, because that&#039;s who they are as champs.\n\n#How to do this\n\n- Look at Kalista: Her AAs scale with 90% of her AD. Combine this with carefully controlling different adcs&#039; base stats and you can give them all unique scalings\n  - ex: graves AAs now scale 200% with AD, but his base AS is now shit. This gives him an incentive to stack AD, arpen, and crit, but avoid AS. It pushes him away from dps builds and into burst builds.\n\n\n**edit: people are saying how this would add too much complexity to the game.**\n- An alternative is: nerf all AD items, then give marksmen *who are supposed to deal more dps* stronger steroids in their kits.\n\n#Benefits\n\n- More marksman variety.\n  - When every marksman is good at exactly the same things, there&#039;s no incentive to pick anything but whoever happens to be the strongest marksman at the moment.\n  - When all marksmen scale exactly the same, because near-100% of their scaling is based off of their items, every marksman builds the exact same items and brings the exact same thing to a team.\n- More interesting kits on marksmen.\n  - Taking power out of marksmen&#039;s raw AA scaling with items, you can put that power back into their abilities and make them more interesting.\n  - You can&#039;t deny that Kalista is interesting, both from where they&#039;ve put power in her kit (whether or not you think that&#039;s a good idea) and her itemization choices.\n\n#Thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-09-29T05:47:20.820+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":21,"body":"The problem with giving every ADC new and unique scalings means that different items work differently on each champ, which makes learning the game much harder.

I'm not sure I like your solution though. The biggest reason I dislike the idea of changing base stats is that it makes item behavior inconsistent. Though this doesn't really hurt invested players like you and me, it makes is very hard for newer players to learn things about the game, which hurts the growth of the game. Imagine for example a player who starts by learning the marksman role on graves (without knowing about his base stats). If our hypothetical newbie buys attack speed he hampers himself significantly but if they buy AD they succeed. This isn't inherently bad because it's why we don't see AP graves, but it leads to a problem. When our player switches to vayne the basic mechanics switch over, but the item decisions do not. Suddenly buying BT and IE is a terrible build, and there's no clear reason why. Each marksman now has a set of items that have to be learned, despite the fact that they all theoretically are the same class of champions. Right now any marksman can build the default IE, PD, LW build and it will work okay (the same is true of mages with deathcap, void, zhonyas and the various tanks with randuins, visage, warmogs). Losing out on that will make the skills of itemization transfer poorly which will make it harder for new players to learn the game.\n\nThe second reason I disagree is a balance reason. Imagine for example that the best ADC in a hypothetical metagame is Graves who builds a BT and IE every game (under your system) and that the other marksmen build those items only rarely. How do we go about nerfing graves (assuming a nerf is better than a set of buffs for fixing the problem)? We can nerf his inherent scaling, but that just brings us back towards the current system. Alternately we can nerf BT and/or IE, but then those items become even worse on the other marksmen so that only graves will ever build them, and next time graves is on top of the meta the problem is only worse. This problem already exists in the form of hybrid items, in order for them to be usable on the champions that are meant to scale with them they have to be completely useless on everyone else.\n\nAll that said, I still think we need some solution to the issue of all the marksmen feeling the same after the laning phase. I would suggest that the way to do this should focus on making each marksman's skills (especially the non-steroid skills) continue to be relevant into the late game. For example, you could make MF's make it rain and bullet time scale with attack speed (ticking more frequently for the same damage) similarly to the culling so that she would still be incentivized to use them for damage instead of just attacking. This would make MF uniquely output ADC damage in a large area of effect at the cost of not being able to fight as well as other ADC's when her spells are on cooldown. Graves could be given mage-like ratios on his spells so he could act like an assassin at the beginning of a fight (if he was willing to really get right in the opponent's face). A lot of marksmen already have something uniquely theirs (kogmaw with his long range, kalista with her rend objective control and kiting, ezreal's poke) so to really differentiate them I think it would be better to turn those skills up to 11 instead of trying to tune their base stats.","replies":[{"poster":"Nefas","date":"2015-09-29T17:43:46.524+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The biggest reason I like these ideas is that it makes \"item behavior inconsistent\" in your words.

They are all *mages* but Xerath is a poke-siege Mage, Viktor is a control/burst Mage, and Swain is a bruiser-sustain Mage. I don't see why we shouldn't have the same thing with ADCs. It isn't just the core three items with ADCs - pretty much the whole 6 are fairly static throughout the class and as long as they are all primarily based around AAs it will pretty much remain that way with some minor variations with BotRK.

The choice shouldn't be between best and unusable, it should be between best and okay. If you build seraphs and deathcap on velkoz you will still do damage just fine. The items do exactly what is expected. Sure you'll lose the mirror match to a velkoz with morellos and void staff but you still get the expected benefit from the items. The problem is when buying an items does not do what you expect. If deathcap randomly didn't increase the damage of a mage's spells that would be bad and would make it harder to learn that mage. Similarly, if phantom dancer didn't meaningfully increase attack speed (such as because attack the base attack speed of a hypothetical graves was half that of other marksmen) then it would mean that learning graves was significantly harder.

You do so and then get confused because you don't do all that much more in damage, just a bit, because his ratios are bad.  You really haven't gotten the supposed 'expected benefit' of death cap's mega damage boost. All because the player couldn't be bothered to read ratios and figure out how to actually play the champ. It's the exact same thing. You buy AS on hypothetical graves, you will still attack faster, just not that much faster. You buy AP and mana on velkoz, you'll do a bit of damage but not very much and will likely lose not just against a mirror match better build velkoz but against any competently built opponent. \n\nI'm not the biggest fan of the comparison because AD would still be fairly core stat on ADCs just as AP for the most part is the core stat for mages (yes some like velkoz function far better off of magic pen and cd reduction). AS is more of an area where there can be major difference between champs like between mana and mana regen.\n\nSome of these differences could be emphasized on the passive tool tip - eg about how much AAs will do or could be added to an ability as a passive.\n\nSo what if phantom dancer doesn't increase attack speed all that much on hypothetical graves? It still increases attack speed. It doesn't mean that the learning curve on graves is much harder. In your hypothetical, the player can't be bothered to either look at the champion's stats or look at recommended items which would not include attack speed items. You might as well say that every champ should be the same otherwise new players would get confused about the difference between tanks and mages.\n\nThat there would be itemization problems is not an argument against this - it's an argument for updating the very limited number of items that ADCs currently use.\n\nWe've been at this for a while and I won't convince you and you won't convince me, and that's fine.

The more itemization slants towards perfectly locked builds determined by inherent synergy, the less skill can compensate for a lack of knowledge.","replies":[{"poster":"Nefas","date":"2015-09-30T16:29:29.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dislike the example because I think it is way too extreme - everyone has skill and knowledge to some degree. I don't think they are particularly equal - does skill really have a limit? Arguably no, you can always get better in aiming, predicting  enemy champ and team actions, Does knowledge really have a limit? Arguably yes, there are a finite number of stats, numbers, timers, cool downs, etc that are in the game.\n\nEspecially in this case,  the knowledge we are talking about is not that difficult to acquire. This just requires basic thinking about what the champ does, how it behaves. Its really not that hard nor does it take that long to figure out that certain items are flat out better than others - *especially* in the extreme cases that are being discussed where graves basically would scale with AD and Armor Pen and not with AS. This isn't a high level type of knowledge such as internalizing enemy champ cool downs and being able to play off of that, this is reading your own tooltips. If a player is too lazy to do that, then I honestly don't see the need to cater to them. Call that elitist whatever if you want, but this is not asking that much.","replies":[{"poster":"Zok72","date":"2015-09-30T19:54:07.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The example doesn't attack any magnitude to the differences, it isn't extreme, just categorical. Also, you have arbitrarily asserted a limit to skill without proof (though I will cede that there is a limit to game knowledge).\n\nBut to address the meat of your point, the knowledge of what scales well on graves is easy enough to acquire, but the knowledge of base scaling is not. There is no tooltip, guilde, etc. IN GAME which indicates that IE and PD together will out damage botrk and LW over the course of a long fight, just experimental evidence, the kind new players have to acquire slowly. Sure, our hypothetical graves could read tooltips and then buy AD but not attack speed, but then when he switched to ashe (whose tooltip mentions critical strikes) how would he know to buy attack speed? So yes, you could create tooltips which tell every player what to buy, or very concise recommended items (buy these items in this order), but then you're basically not even making it knowledge so much as checking a player's ability to read. If everyone has perfect item orders because every champion has only one viable item set, then there's no knowledge or ingenuity or skill to itemization, it's just reading a chart and the only thing that matters is the presentation of that chart.\n\nOr put more succinctly, if there is only one right option, and the knowledge is easy to acquire, why bother having options? On the other hand, if knowledge is not trivial to acquire but instead must be learned with time and experience then the decisions in itemization remain a meaningful way of differentiating between players and in this scenario it is important that the \"wrong\" options still be functional. You don't win a game just for building the right items, but it should help some.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2015-09-29T23:25:04.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zok72,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BjO3WHwR,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-09-29T05:19:42.075+0000)\n>\n> I like your points here, I think it's a very thoughtful analysis of the situation. I'm not sure I like your solution though. The biggest reason I dislike the idea of changing base stats is that it makes item behavior inconsistent. Though this doesn't really hurt invested players like you and me, it makes is very hard for newer players to learn things about the game, which hurts the growth of the game. Imagine for example a player who starts by learning the marksman role on graves (without knowing about his base stats). If our hypothetical newbie buys attack speed he hampers himself significantly but if they buy AD they succeed. This isn't inherently bad because it's why we don't see AP graves, but it leads to a problem. When our player switches to vayne the basic mechanics switch over, but the item decisions do not. Suddenly buying BT and IE is a terrible build, and there's no clear reason why. Each marksman now has a set of items that have to be learned, despite the fact that they all theoretically are the same class of champions. Right now any marksman can build the default IE, PD, LW build and it will work okay (the same is true of mages with deathcap, void, zhonyas and the various tanks with randuins, visage, warmogs). Losing out on that will make the skills of itemization transfer poorly which will make it harder for new players to learn the game.\n> \n> The second reason I disagree is a balance reason. Imagine for example that the best ADC in a hypothetical metagame is Graves who builds a BT and IE every game (under your system) and that the other marksmen build those items only rarely. How do we go about nerfing graves (assuming a nerf is better than a set of buffs for fixing the problem)? We can nerf his inherent scaling, but that just brings us back towards the current system. Alternately we can nerf BT and/or IE, but then those items become even worse on the other marksmen so that only graves will ever build them, and next time graves is on top of the meta the problem is only worse. This problem already exists in the form of hybrid items, in order for them to be usable on the champions that are meant to scale with them they have to be completely useless on everyone else.\n> \n> All that said, I still think we need some solution to the issue of all the marksmen feeling the same after the laning phase. I would suggest that the way to do this should focus on making each marksman's skills (especially the non-steroid skills) continue to be relevant into the late game. For example, you could make MF's make it rain and bullet time scale with attack speed (ticking more frequently for the same damage) similarly to the culling so that she would still be incentivized to use them for damage instead of just attacking. This would make MF uniquely output ADC damage in a large area of effect at the cost of not being able to fight as well as other ADC's when her spells are on cooldown. Graves could be given mage-like ratios on his spells so he could act like an assassin at the beginning of a fight (if he was willing to really get right in the opponent's face). A lot of marksmen already have something uniquely theirs (kogmaw with his long range, kalista with her rend objective control and kiting, ezreal's poke) so to really differentiate them I think it would be better to turn those skills up to 11 instead of trying to tune their base stats.\n\nSee the OP, I think the edit is a much better solution.\n\nThe problem right now is that AD itemization gives insane scaling. It doesn't matter whether you're MF or Vel'Koz, if you have a full 6-item build you will shit physical damage (does vel'koz shit?). Since all adcs have access to that scaling, the amount of places elsewhere that you can add power to their kit is much smaller than, say, mages. If you nerf AD itemization so all AD champs don't automatically hyperscale, then you can, as you say, \"turn their skills up to 11.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Zok72","date":"2015-09-30T06:41:58.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Post was made before the edit.
