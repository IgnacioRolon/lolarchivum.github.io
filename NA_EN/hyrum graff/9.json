When undecided players look at which position to play, they evaluate the pros and cons of each one, what they get to do that's unique, what the tradeoffs are, etc. In the case of supports, though, there are far too many cons: focusing on assisting allies is itself pretty divisive, as it's considered a positive by only a subset of players (which is fine), and disliked by many others, but adding to that is a laundry list of gameplay issues that weigh Support down. Not only do supports often have less gold, experience and overall freedom than most other champions, it's also mandatory to have a support every game, which causes even support mains to eventually burn out. By contrast, marksmen, the only other mandatory class, get priority for gold income and team assistance, and itemize to feel like the most powerful champions in the game.\n\nI think the issue with the support position is that its implementation is sort of backwards: because its appeal is so niche (few people want to sacrifice personal glory for team synergy, and supports across all games tend to be the least popular class), the class and the position both need to essentially have every other concession made for them in order to be popular: at the very least, they should be running on equal gold and experience with their allies, and even if they somehow had the highest gold and XP income, they'd still be niche. They deserve access to items that make them feel powerful at what they do, and focus on their champion's own unique contribution to their team. Even in terms of recognition, there's work to be done, and any champion who assisted in a massive play or an ace deserves recognition on the same level as a kill streak. Instead, supports are saddled with some of the game's largest and most severe set of restrictions, and don't feel valued nearly enough for the tremendous contributions they make to their team.\n\nAs for solutions, at this point I think it might be beneficial to supports if Riot removed the Sightstone line: the item is boring, none of its upgrades feel worth buying, yet the item is also mandatory. Supports are not only required to spend an item slot for an effect everyone can already access via trinkets, the very existence of Sightstone forces supports to shoulder the burden of vision more than any other class, which is neither fun nor functional. Without it, supports would have 800 gold and an item slot off of their mandatory build, and remaining items and trinkets could then be buffed as necessary for teams to have the same overall amount of vision and counter-vision. A change like that alone wouldn't solve all the issues with Support, but could go a long way in making them feel more fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2016-11-04T15:53:13.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The flip side is that removing SS means supports can't sweep and ward at the same time, which gives them even less agency.

If supports could only either ward or sweep, they'd have more time to do things that would not involve laying down the vision everybody's supposed to partipate equally in, and could thereby have more agency overall, as they'd get to be closer to where the action is. Having supports dip into vision more than anyone else has never really turned out well for them, and has limited both their itemization and gameplay choices. Prior to Preseason 6, removing Sightstone would have been horrible, because supports would have been forced to load up on wards 24/7, but now that stealth wards aren't purchaseable, there's no \"alternative option\" for supports to fall back onto, besides maybe Tracker's Knife, which means there wouldn't really be a way for them to be forced to buy a new mandatory vision item, or to do more vision things than anyone else.\n\nAs for the game's gold income items, while I think they're ultimately a crutch that should be solved through changes to duo+ laning income, I agree that they should give more gold, though they should likely also have tighter restrictions on their gold generation to avoid being used by solo laners. Having Favor work purely on ally minion kills, and Tribute only activate when an ally is nearby, for example, could achieve that.

Controlling vision does dictate which objectives your team and theirs are able to take, so I think that is something.\n\nThat said, it's also easy for a support alone to be caught out while sweeping or warding, and when you need another teammate to come with you to ward/sweep, your agency is now gone anyway.\n\n>If supports could only either ward or sweep, they&#x27;d have more time to do things that would not involve laying down the vision everybody&#x27;s supposed to partipate equally in, and could thereby have more agency overall, as they&#x27;d get to be closer to where the action is. Having supports dip into vision more than anyone else has never really turned out well for them, and has limited both their itemization and gameplay choices.

The only times when you can buy a different item first are:\n\n1. On karma, because she gets SO much benefit out of CDR. But you should get it ASAP after you hit 25-35% cdr.\n2. If you're playing against a full AD team comp (something like Irelia / Zed / Yi / Lucian / Janna). If they have even a little hybrid damage or AP tank, like Jayce, Gnar, Leona, Naut, Maokai, Malphite, etc, this doesn't apply.\n3. If the enemy has a fed AP splitpush threat or your team has no concept of wave control, you can get banner instead.\n\n---\n\nLocket's aura (and to a lesser extent, shield) gives such strong, reliable power that anything else puts you at a significant disadvantage. Locket gives all nearby teammates 15 MR. Before penetration, that's 15% magic damage reduction, (more like 10% after all's said and done) permanently. Compare to exhaust, which reduces a champion's damage by 40%. Would you spend 2500 gold if Locket were described as \"A permanent semi-exhaust on all nearby enemy AP champions\"?\n\nThe problem with is that, despite Locket being blatantly OP, it's really hard to feel the impact of its power, because AP champions are balanced around the assumption that the enemy team will have one. So the scenario ends up being -- when your team has a locket, it's business as usual, and then when you don't have a locket it's HOLY DICKS HOW DID LB JUST KILL ME WITH TWO ABILITIES.","replies":[{"poster":"MrNhbdy","date":"2016-11-04T13:34:19.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, so quite recently (1 or 2 months), I've been trying to use more actives to help my team.
