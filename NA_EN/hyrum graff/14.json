In this case, shove the wave into the turret and let your lane Recall as well.\n\nThis way you basically get a free wave of minions or two on both yourself and your lane that your opponents don't get. Basically guarantees a lead in that lane. Without the shove you can't really guarantee a decent Recall from your teammate(s).\n\nIf your gank doesn't do anything, the question is then, \"Does your teammate need to Recall?\" Even though you're sort of weakening your teammate by leeching XP and gold, any Recall almost always loses you some anyway. So the quicker and more painless you can make your teammate's trip to base, the better off they are. And since you're getting some Gold/XP yourself, it's still a positive choice overall.\n\nBut if none of those are true and your teammate just wants to sit in lane, I don't recommend taxing their lane for no reason.","replies":[{"poster":"LordOfTheLeague","date":"2014-11-17T17:49:30.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if you push the enemy out of lane, it's not always a good thing to push the lane because it's not forced that your teammate need to recall.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-11-17T16:35:43.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">IMO it comes down to maximizing your team-wide power.\n\nAgreed. I mean, isn't that what pretty much every meta concept is about?\n\n>If your gank doesn't do anything, the question is then, \"Does your teammate need to Recall?\" Even though you're sort of weakening your teammate by leeching XP and gold, any Recall almost always loses you some anyway. So the quicker and more painless you can make your teammate's trip to base, the better off they are. And since you're getting some Gold/XP yourself, it's still a positive choice overall.\n\nI'd say then it comes down to (from the jungler's perspective), \"Do I stay in lane and last hit for a while, or do I shove the lane and get back to ganking/farming the jungle?\" That choice is probably different at your elo, where the global pressure is a bigger factor, than mine. And based on a number of other factors.\n\n>But if none of those are true and your teammate just wants to sit in lane, I don't recommend taxing their lane for no reason.\n\nIn competitive LoL, and maybe your elo soloq, I'm with you 100%. In my experience at lower elo, though, if the gank was successful (gave me an advantage in whatever form), giving the jungler some more strength is often the best way to maximize team-wide power:\n\n- If the jungler is pulling off successful ganks in my lane, chances are they're doing it elsewhere, too.\n- I have a much easier time carrying if my team is doing well or going even than pulling us back from a big deficit, even if I'm relatively less fed in the former scenario.\n- Once laning phase ends, junglers are often relatively less fed than their laning counterparts. If they have more gold, they have more ability to continue to make the plays.\n- I'm usually able to win my lane even if I don't retain the advantage from every CS up I am, from the jungler gank that forced my opponent back (Karma is love, Karma is life).\n\nSo, in general, I'd rather spread power amongst my team, even if I'll scale better with that gold than my jungler will.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"iainB85","date":"2014-11-16T23:34:16.558+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> I was just wondering what your thoughts are on lane taxing?

If a jungler needs a little more gold to get an item before back or to catch up then they should take it, because that will overall benefit the team more. \n\nThe short of it is you have to trust your jungler to take minions when they think they need to and roll with it.

It's kind of like how in botlane, the general consensus is, \"most of the time the support shouldn't mess with the minion wave because it interferes with the adc's ability to cs and manipulate how the wave pushes.\" Except that sometimes (csing under tower, pushing hard), the support *should* help the adc.\n\nI was attempting to come to a consensus on what's acceptable, in general, not a 'follow these or get reported' set of rules.

Lumping everything into one paragraph like that makes it difficult to tell. I'll play it safe and go with you think it's rude when you ping the jungler out of lane.\n\nAnd here's the thing, most of the time I agree with you. It's rude to not let them tax a bit **when they've done something**. In the scenario in my post, the jungler took the kill and then was attempting to take the minions as well. Yes, the jungler himself is getting fed, but the laner has almost no gain from the gank as a whole other than their opponent being sent back to base. That's not teamwork. That's not working together. That's the jungler being greedy at the expense of the laner in question and lowering morale.\n\nHere's another scenario where I believe it's appropriate to ping the jungler to get lost: You're in mid lane and you've pushed the lane so that the opponent is farming under tower. Maybe the enemy jungler is afk or is up top or something, so it's safe to push like this. Your jungler walks through mid lane as if he's on a nice leisurely walk, and on his way out he casually smites a cannon minion. That's not teamwork, that's being a dick and taxing for no reason other than he stopped by.\n\nJunglers take a lot of unwarranted crap, but once in a while they do deserve it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cenobite Azaziel","date":"2014-11-17T20:10:16.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So let me get this straight :\n\nA member of your team, has to pick a crappy summoner spell (to be able to jungle early and secure objectives), has to build awful jungling items (see their cost efficiency and compare with other lane rushed items that if are relevant out of the jungle are straight foward nerferd [ old SOtAG)), that are only relevant to the early game (except flare), since  anyone during mid/late game can clear camps with ease,  has a weak stream of money (hey we have to balance it so the lanes won't get bullied and the early ganker jungler skyrock because of the ganks!) , has to gush on potions (shaco and other junglers), gives the team buffs, don't have ANY defense (towers right behind you? nope) if being counterjungled (just his team) and you're BITCH*NG about some lane creeps?\n\nReally?\n\n Put yourself in the jungler's shoes before you complain about them.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-11-17T21:10:32.820+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You sir, misread my post.

I don't care how much you need cs, 6 last hits for me is better than 3 for you any day.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2014-11-18T14:45:12.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's not so cut and dry as you make it seem.\n\nif you guys get the kill, regardless of who gets the gold for it, you want your jungler to help you hard shove the wave into turret. this lets the wave reset and gives you time to recall so that you can snowball your gold and experience advantage that his gank gave you, and so that you're at 100% hp and potions when your opponent returns to lane.\n\nif you don't get the kill but you get a summoner and the wave is pushing (IE can't be frozen) then same as above, you want to hard shove it so that it resets and your lane opponent can't just farm under turret. this gives your jungler the opportunity to return for a kill later, or stick around and snag it, or at a minimum it lets you deny your opponent farm.\n\n3rd case is if you don't get the kill, but you get your opponent low enough for a dive. you want to shove the wave hard enough that you can threaten to dive your opponent if he sticks around, and if he doesnt you get a ton of turret damage or you get the turret kill.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cenobite Azaziel","date":"2014-11-17T21:46:24.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is no thing as overtaxing (except when the jungler is trolling you). \nWhenever the oposite laner is killed you have gold for the assist/kill, you have about 1 or 2 waves of no harass free CS and exp advantage.\nIf the gank is goes even, no one died, you have the free poke/damage that the jungle provided.\nAlmost every time the jungle ganks you gain some of benefit. It's kind of hard the jungler ravage the whole creep wave in early game.\n\nIf you only consider tax a matter of gold/reward for a good job, you should give it to your jungler. \n\nTax in most  cases isn't about the gold (as I already explained, if you cared about the gold, you wouldn't jungle in first place) .It is about the lane pushing/freezing and the matchup.\n\nIn a lane that my team is playing nasus, I rarely tax because that means pushing and putting him in a dangerous situation that hurts the whole team. Same as mordekaiser, veigar, non mobile champs.\n\nIf you need to push or get some early advantage/ rotate to another lane, pushing and taxing is a must.\n\n\nThere is no consensus. Top lane will always be \"Dude you're hurting my gold income by taxing!\" (sometimes his cs is 60%) , and jungle will always be \"I still need your CS, lost time camping your lane) , unless it's a feral flare power farmer.  Then the QQ is reversed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MastèrBaitèr","date":"2014-11-17T16:23:46.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its funny because some games you can't even hold a lane for someone. Literally got yelled at a nasus for holding a lane and freezing it by last hitting minions. He kept yelling \" GET OFF MY FARM STAPH TAKING IT *****\" even though he was at base. Like im REALLLLYYY going to let the gold just slip away.\n\nOften times as a jungler people think im taking, but lanes don't know how to shove the lane or push when the enemys dead after a successful gank, or how to proxy the next wave to put them further behind and get damage on the tower.\n\nI usually don't tax unless its in situations where its a fast shove, and even then i just spam abilities to shove and proxy and share it(if he's still here.) \n\nIll go and shove mid too when mids roaming and the cs is just sitting there as well","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hinro Honato","date":"2014-11-17T16:11:40.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of my ganks are none or one minion taxing. \"Welp I got rid of them for you, good luck and I'm smiting something on the way out.\" That is how it goes most of the time.

Two or three waves usually gets the point across. In the most extreme cases I'm not leaving your lane until it's pushed up to their inhib turret.

You do realize you fall off late-game, right?\" When he does next to nothing to even touch the enemy and then procedes to take my entire wave just because he can, that's really playing selfishly. Too many people I think take the farm \"just because they can\" not weighing whether or not it is good for the team or not.\nI also think taxing depends on the lane match-ups. If you are in an unfavorable lane match-up you want to get as fed as possible to try and shut down the other enemy by itemizing faster than they do.

I've had people yell at me to stop taking CS and leave the lane, only for them to immediately die afterwards because I was doing it to pressure the enemy and give them a chance to recall. Someone coming mid-lane to take the tower will push, but some mid-laners scream and shout for them to stop. Even a support taking CS *completely* out of range of the ADC could get exclamation marks all over their screen and a death threat to boot.\n\nIt's in fact a (bad) habit of mine to forget about taxing entirely.
