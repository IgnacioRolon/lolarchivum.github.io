Then I click on one to switch the page.\n\nIn the alpha client, I have to click the drop-down menu, hover over, and wait around half a second for the distribution to pop up. I can also only add one mastery point at a time (instead of 5), but I think that&#039;s a bug. Those two combined increase the amount of time for me to select masteries by 10-20 seconds, which makes it incredibly hard to finish my masteries in time for game start in ARAM or when I&#039;m last pick.\n\nYou want masteries to be more about meaningful decisions that you make in champ select depending on what playstyle you want, right? I'd love to see them more incorporated into the actual selection process: select a champ and lock it in, select a skin and lock it in, select runes and masteries. Imagine if the entire screen real estate were dedicated to choosing masteries, the way that it's dedicated to choosing a skin.\n\nSo I don&#039;t use the alpha client, and if the issue isn&#039;t fixed by the time the AIR client is deprecated, I&#039;ll be forced to take a break from League.\n\nI&#039;ll submit this through the feedback site, too, but I really hope someone sees this as it is a game-breaking problem for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-10-26T17:54:48.814+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is a game breaking problem for everyone, good thing we caught it in the alpha ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2016-10-26T19:00:40.131+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot a huevo,realm=NA,application-id=2E4zVIwd,discussion-id=wb29hiJf,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-10-26T17:54:48.814+0000)\n>\n> It is a game breaking problem for everyone, good thing we caught it in the alpha ;)\n\ntouche\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2016-10-27T03:23:11.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot a huevo,realm=NA,application-id=2E4zVIwd,discussion-id=wb29hiJf,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-10-26T17:54:48.814+0000)\n>\n> It is a game breaking problem for everyone, good thing we caught it in the alpha ;)\n\nAck, I also just realized there are multiple duplicates of this thread.
