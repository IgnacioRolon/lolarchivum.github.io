What would they be wearing (or wielding?!)\n\nI THOUGHT YOU WOULD NEVER ASK :'D\n\nPersonally, I would go about it as such:\n\n(Pool) Party Crashers!\n\nTop: Yorick would be interesting for this, and I will go with it fully. Yorick would be pale with a slight sunburn, and he would be wearing a red and white stripped one piece swim suit. His shovel would be those nets pool boys use to clean pools. His ghouls would be different types of pool toys (Q could be a seal, W could be a giraffe, E  could be a snake), and his Ultimate would be a water clone which is tainted water.\nJungle: Zac, where he is water is fairly obvious, but give him trunks or a speedo, with goggles, and maybe some fish in him. His Q would be normal with splash effects, his W he would rupture in a splash, maybe some fish would come out too, his E would be him doing a dive across, and his Ult would be him preparing for a cannonball! \nMid: I would love Orianna for this. She would try to enjoy the party like everyone else, but not being an actual person would make everyone else uncomfortable. Her Pet would be a beach ball, and she would be in a two piece (being made of two parts herself), and all her particles/effects would be watery!\nAdc: Jinx with a water gun Pow Pow colored/designed like a duck or hippo, and either a proper shark or maybe even a crocodile designed to look like Pool Party Renekton for Fishbones that shoots water balloons. Her Zap! Would be a sling shot that she launches other water balloons. Her Chompers would be little crocodiles or crabs with water balloons strapped to them. Her ultimate would be a dolphin float-y that bursts into a huge splash!  \nSupport: Morganna would probably be ideal, and she could have a towel wrapped around her lower body to be her skirt, and then she could have a bikini top on too. As a comedy piece, maybe her wings are inflatable? Her effects would be pretty consistently water particles, maybe her Black Shield being the only thing that isn't. Maybe a water balloon shield or just water as well.\n\nI think this is a pretty good outline. Would love to hear what you think, but I understand if you're busy. Hope you enjoy them regardless!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2015-02-08T01:03:50.773+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think there's already a bunch of threads about suggestions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HuskerWolf82","date":"2015-02-10T00:20:35.262+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=EMVAAjn4,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-02-08T00:43:52.214+0000)\n>\n> I think more Pool Party skins would be awesome! \n> \n> What champions would you like to see?!

Why not? Change the crows to seagulls or something though.\n{{champion:254}} - Giant foam/balloon hands for the ultimate water battle. Her abilities would be perfect for a splash fight! \n{{champion:21}} - A two piece lifeguard outfit to make them ladies green with jealousy. Dual water pistols and an E that is a deluge of water to drench her opponents.\n{{champion:222}} - Fighting back against Vi with her arsenal of Gatling water gun, rocket propelled coconuts, bouncing water balloon bombs that stun, and her R a water balloon in the shape of something funny.\n{{champion:74}} - Science has gone mad at the pool! Turrets become water hoses like you see at water parks or something. Drawing a blank here but sure something fun could be thought up.\n{{champion:201}} - Have his shield resemble a wooden Tiki statue face. Have him wear a stripped swimwear like mustached guys wore back in early 1900s like [this](https://images.search.yahoo.com/images/view;_ylt=A0LEViYYSNlUmkYAFrwnnIlQ;_ylu=X3oDMTB0dmRibmhwBHNlYwNzYwRjb2xvA2JmMQR2dGlkA1lIUzAwMV8x?p=early+1900+men+swimwear&back=https%3A%2F%2Fsearch.yahoo.com%2Fyhs%2Fsearch%3Fp%3Dearly%2B1900%2Bmen%2Bswimwear%26ei%3DUTF-8%26hsimp%3Dyhs-001%26hspart%3Dmozilla&w=200&h=316&imgurl=4.bp.blogspot.com%2F-JN1nKY4PTDI%2FUKO15AvMKzI%2FAAAAAAAAAAU%2FTYCIkytGrMM%2Fs1600%2F1900.jpg%231900%2520men%2527s%2520swim%2520wear%2520200x316&size=11KB&name=1900.jpg&rcurl=http%3A%2F%2Forangearticles.blogspot.com%2F2012%2F11%2Fevolution-of-mens-swimwear.html&rurl=http%3A%2F%2Forangearticles.blogspot.com%2F2012%2F11%2Fevolution-of-mens-swimwear.html&type=&no=1&tt=120&oid=609c7fb6268cfc4feecd092628aaf694&tit=1900.jpg%231900%2520men%2527s%2520swim%2520wear%2520200x316&sigr=12a1hqtil&sigi=13oik7ubt&sign=108djs908&sigt=103vg5ole&sigb=133t4pofm&fr=yhs-mozilla-001&hspart=mozilla&hsimp=yhs-001)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Giovarco","date":"2015-02-08T21:19:38.101+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pool Party Urgot would be awesome really.
