I always go Relic on him.\nBut Talisman gives you a nice amount of Armor too, and the Raptors cloak passive is very good on thresh for the increased mobility and MS, especially when seiging.\nAnd the active even more so.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RisenDarkKnight","date":"2016-11-25T22:42:30.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to last hit properly, but it's not too hard with his E passive.
