I believe it happened when the \"Defeat\" came up, and I believe it is an audio corruption.

If this is only happening with league, then some bad game files could be the culprit.  Download our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and perform a repair to get that fixed up.  Make sure your drivers are up to date as well!
