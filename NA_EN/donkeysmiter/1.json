Whereas before there was a shortcut to the new client, so then I never had to re-download. I suggest, that in the new client, when you click settings, there should be a button where it creates a shortcut for the client.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-15T21:27:24.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a little unfortunate, but for now, you do still need to update from the old client if you need to fully reinstall League. The installer hasn't updated to go directly to the updated client so you will need to go through the client update, and then patch up to the latest patch as well. I don't have a date quite yet on when the installer will be updated.","replies":[{"poster":"DonkeySmiter","date":"2017-06-17T02:15:10.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, just try to get that update where it is fixed! :D","replies":[]}]}]}
