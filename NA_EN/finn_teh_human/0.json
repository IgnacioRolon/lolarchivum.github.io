I've tried everything from resetting my internet to checking my settings on everything etc. I can't figure out why it's spiking. My internet seems fine, was wondering if anyone else has had this problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-02T22:09:06.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The suddent change in high ping can happen with packet loss.  You haven't disconnected entirely, but something is definitely causing your network to the game server to struggle.  In this case, run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) for these games so we can get an overview of what's happening.","replies":[]}]}
