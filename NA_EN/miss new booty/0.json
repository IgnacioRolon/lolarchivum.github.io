AD carries are very weak early and scale only with gold, so they need to be able to last hit well; they have a support (who has enough base utility to survive on very little gold) to help them with that. They're placed in the bot lane because botlane ganks can turn into dragons fairly easily, and having a support makes it more likely that the carry can survive a gank on the longer lane.\n\nAlthough AP carries (the typical midlane role) need gold to function well, their most important resource is experience, since ranking up their abilities gives them most of their power. With that being so, they're placed in the middle lane; since it's shorter, it's much harder to be zoned out of experience range, and the shortness of the lane also gives them a decent chance of escaping a gank or all-in even without a support to help them. Since levels are their most important resource, giving up a whole wave of XP to ward the river shouldn't be common enough to require a sight stone.\n\nIf you're looking for another sight stone on the team, jungle is your best bet. Although junglers don't earn as much gold as laners, their items are also remarkably gold efficient, meaning that they can pony up without too much pain. They also spend a lot of time roaming around gank paths anyway, and so get full use out of the sightstone without roaming too far from their intended path.","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2015-11-05T03:14:46.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  AD carries are very weak early and scale only with gold\n\nWhy does everyone say this?

One of their jobs is usually to apply damage, and those roles can't really be shelling out the 800g and setting themselves behind or wasting an item slot.\n\nAnd as for mid being in charge of warding, that's also a less than optimal idea. Yes, they are closer to both lanes, but since they have to keep up their farm, roaming isn't desirable unless it can net you a profit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fusarix","date":"2015-11-05T03:17:18.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If mid got a sightstone item. It would be a must have on mid laners, and if the item didn't work on your mid lane champion of choice, they wouldnt be viable. And if the item had stats to compensate every mid pick (which isn't possible) it would be too expensive and they wouldn't get it anyways. So nope. they shouldn't get a sightstone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-11-05T02:41:06.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"An upgraded trinket is all mid needs.","replies":[]}]}
