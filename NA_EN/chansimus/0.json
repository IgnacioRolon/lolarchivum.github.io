Some other regions will get the patch earlier based off the deploy order (I think Russia's up first, though wouldn't swear to it). \n\nAs a general note as with other pre-seasons it's likely that, due to the sheer number of things being changed and the way those things are interconnected, balance on at least a couple of things will be noticeably off. That will mean at least some of the assassins for example will probably need buffs or nerfs pretty quickly. We'll be working to address whatever crops up in the next patch, odds are though that some champs will look way too weak or way too strong for a little bit though. \n\nTLDR: Balance on some stuff will probably be significantly off for a couple of weeks, we'll be working on it quickly.","replies":[{"poster":"MistroTTC","date":"2016-11-08T13:36:35.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This may be a little greedy, but will that include replays?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-11-08T19:38:54.347+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe so, though that's not a feature I'm directly involved with myself.
