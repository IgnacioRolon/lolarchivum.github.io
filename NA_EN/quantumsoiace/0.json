I researched it and found out that this is low priority queue even though I wasn't the one who received it my SOLO/DUO ranked games are being affected by it. How can I fix this? I've gotten 2 games in a row with exceptionally toxic people with a queue I don't deserve.","replies":[{"poster":"DarlinDoli","date":"2017-06-10T03:57:07.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After Upgrade, and before, my game would freeze at least one game out of 4 or 5 a night. never figured out why... but now I have a LPQ. I think I have had like 6 now, and there is no update as to how many of these I have to sit through.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-10T01:22:11.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went ahead and checked you account, and there's no signs that you currently have a low priority queue. My best guess is that the friend you're grouped with DOES have an LPQ though. If you're queued for a match with someone who is in low priority queue, you will need to wait through that queue with them. \n\nDo me a favor and try q-ing up solo, and let me know if you still see the red triangle or not. If it's still there when you Q solo, take a screenshot and shoot it my way so I can look over this more!!","replies":[]}]}
