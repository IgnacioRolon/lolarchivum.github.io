Such as my match history, the most recent game as Vi, bottom lane gave up around 10 kills to Jinx, before they ever hit level 6. Arguably, their dynamic que either got lucky or was just much better. Not too sure what can be done when the enemy bottom lane has 10 kills before 10 minutes. Not to mention mid lane getting thrashed too. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the game as Sivir, was the complete opposite, The enemy team just got trashed from the beginning. Team started to throw about half way through by going 2v5 and such but we just grouped and ended after I pointed it out. Anyways, they were getting wrecked. \r\n\r\nThe point is, it seems like I haven't had a CLOSE/EVEN game in quite some time. It's always just a complete stomp one way or the other. Is this due to dynamic que or just bad/good match ups?","replies":[{"poster":"CoffeeDave","date":"2016-04-15T20:57:23.056+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not just you, I've felt this way for a while now.

Teams that are ahead are nearly always able to hold onto and their advantage because if someone gets fed in lane, and they wipe the enemy team in a teamfight as a result, the ridiculous respawn timers ensure that the enemy team is able to take multiple towers and perhaps an dragon as a result.  The resulting buffs/gold increase to everyone else on the team ensures that they stay ahead. \n\nIt's really hard to carry this season as a result of this.  Even if you got 1-2 kills, destroyed the tower, and didn't die at all in your lane, that 0-8 and 0-5 Thresh and Varus bot will make the game literally impossible to come back from.\n\nIt's maddening, and it's the reason I've stayed away from ranked for a good part of this season.  Unless you completely destroy your lane; like, obliterate them from the face of Summoner's Rift, your chances of winning are usually 50-50 depending on which team feeds first.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Megeflegorf","date":"2016-04-15T23:08:37.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've got no idea about high elo but I've seen people not happy with it.
