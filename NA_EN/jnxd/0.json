The fps swaps between 90-500. When there is alot going on around the screen, my fps can go as low as 90. And for the hardware that I have, id say that is pretty messed up. You guys have any suggestions on what to do here?\r\n\r\nI have reinstalled windows, cleaned drivers and redownloaded em', changed the power settings to maximum performance. Nothing seems to work, still staying stable around 200 fps for a while, and then dropping below 150. \r\n\r\nI see that my GPU underclocks itself in lol, dropping as low as around 500 MHZ on both clocks. Power usage on the card is around 10% during gameplay aswell. \r\n\r\nI understand that for a game like this, getting 300 fps isnt crucial, but still, I want my hardware to be like clockwork. Is it my system that is faulty, or could there be something related to this game?\r\n\r\nPlease help me.","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-11-15T23:06:55.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would worry me too if my machine started doing that.\n\nSeems you've already taken a lot of good preliminary steps to troubleshoot, but we have some other ones that you can try over here in our [**FPS Guide**](http://riot.com/2dlHSAF).\n\nWe're also aware that Windows recently released an update, so being on Win 10 may mean that Game DVR is enabled on your computer if it was previously turned off. Having that enabled can affect your FPS so be sure it's turned off.
