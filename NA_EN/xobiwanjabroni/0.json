Here's an example of what happens:\r\n\r\nI'm farming mid land and go to poke my lane opponent, i click to move closer and cast a spell, my move command goes through, but the spell does not, so now I'm just walking through minions toward my opponent and toward where I clicked to move. I am unable to command my champ to move anywhere else and I cant cast spells. For roughly 2-3 seconds I just stand where I last clicked to move to. During this time, I can still see everything happening in real time, ~70fps and ~74ms. Unlike normal lag the minions are still taking damage, things are moving properly, and the music plays normal. My fps and ms don't fluctuate enough to constitute the issue (in my eyes, i don't design vidja games), and I can still fully see animations from move commands and my opponent as they aa and cast spells to fuck my shit up (cause 3 free seconds of poke is redic).\r\n\r\nAs stated before, I'd call it lag, but my connection never reports dropping out, and I don't see the \"Reconnecting\" pop-up. My computer is roughly 3 years old, but this was never an issue between patches 2.7 and 6.13.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks for any advice, and I'll try to clarify my issues if anyone has questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-28T20:52:45.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From your description, it sounds like you're experiencing bursts of *packet loss*. Packets are the small bits of information that are sent to the server when you make any command like moving or using an ability. If some of these are lost en route to the server, it can mean the server won't properly receive your inputs. While there are a lot of potential causes for this to happen, our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) addresses the most common solutions for this. \n\nIf you still have these instances occurring after taking the steps from that guide, please get back to me about it.","replies":[]}]}
