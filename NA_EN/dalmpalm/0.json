My ISP is SHAW and I am in SK. I have attached my trace route to Riot server below. As you can see, the ping start to increase at 208.185.240.194, which is to Abovenet Communications in Seattle. There are many of others Canadian experiencing similar problem since last night. There is a post on Reddit. I think the problem is from Riot side.\r\n\r\nTracing route to 104.160.131.3 over a maximum of 30 hops\r\n\r\n  1     1 ms     9 ms     9 ms  hitronhub.home [192.168.0.1]\r\n  2    24 ms    27 ms    10 ms  70.64.0.1\r\n  3    26 ms    19 ms    24 ms  rd3ha-be101-1.ss.shawcable.net [64.59.183.33]\r\n  4    25 ms    30 ms    19 ms  rd4ha-tge0-2-1-0.ss.shawcable.net [66.163.73.26]\r\n  5    27 ms    49 ms    29 ms  rc3ar-be50.ed.shawcable.net [66.163.73.30]\r\n  6    26 ms    39 ms    27 ms  rc1we-be1.ed.shawcable.net [66.163.70.49]\r\n  7    26 ms    30 ms    39 ms  rc3no-be6.cg.shawcable.net [66.163.64.69]\r\n  8    38 ms    47 ms    49 ms  rc2wt-be100.wa.shawcable.net [66.163.75.233]\r\n  9    56 ms    59 ms    58 ms  rc1wt-be18-1.wa.shawcable.net [66.163.64.81]\r\n 10    58 ms    42 ms    41 ms  six.zayo.com [206.81.80.19]\r\n 11    87 ms    93 ms    99 ms  208.185.240.194.IPYX-089814-ZYO.above.net [208.185.240.194]\r\n 12   119 ms    86 ms    89 ms  104.160.129.35\r\n 13   109 ms    99 ms    84 ms  104.160.131.3\r\n\r\nTrace complete.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-25T21:42:29.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"According to this trace, your latency issues start when your connection hits Shaw's node at:\n>**rc2wt-be100.wa.shawcable.net [66.163.75.233]**\n\n____\nAfter that node, your latency continues to rise until it hits a peak of 99ms before hitting our servers. In this situation, it looks like the routing issue is on both Shaw and Zayo's network, which is a backbone provider that Shaw partners with to get your connection to our servers. I suggest reaching out to Shaw to get in touch with a Tier 2 tech and provide them this trace for additional context.\n\n____\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","replies":[{"poster":"Kantoweru","date":"2016-10-26T00:57:46.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Shouldn't that be Riot's job? You're providing a service that seems to be having troubles with an ISP - shouldn't you get in touch with the ISP to let them know there is an issue and get them to fix it?\n\nThis isn't an isolated issue, there are a ton of us experiencing a 30-40 ping increase overnight.","replies":[]}]}]}
