Say I am not in combat and the enemy jungler is running in to gank.  If I throw my field in his way, it will do nothing to him because it was out of combat.  Say I was sitting in lane with my ADC and I feel like giving them mana.  Does the pool detect if they are in combat, and if so, does csing count as combat (it usually does)?

Great job Soraka, I am sure they wanted some mana while Rengar is ripping their face off.\n\n>2)It doesn't have to be a large amount of mana and/or it could scale off something that would require her to lose help towards something else\n\nOf course it doesn't have to be a lot of mana, but it doesn't take much mana to give someone several more casts than they would have had otherwise.  If you make it to low then you have the issue of it being not worth the mana cost and cooldown.  Why would you scale it off of something that doesn't fit the rest of her, and what would it be?  Max HP?  AD?  Giving her a bad scaling stat is just a way to not give her scaling.\n\n>3) you always need mana, say it was after a small skirmish and some abilities were used or if it was a champion that uses mana frequently\n\nOk, unless you are a champ with a ridiculously small mana pool (or this is pretty early game), a small skirmish does not remove all of your mana.  If you are running out of mana while in a peaceful lane then the mana isn't the problem (unless peaceful includes poke).  If you are poking a lot and running out of mana doing so, then Soraka giving you mana will become a big problem for game balance.  Soraka is a lot of the reason that Urgot got trashed:  she gave him extra mana and so he had to be balanced around it.\n\n> 4) it could drain Soraka's mana/use her hp like her health when she is giving mana\n\nYes, this would be a must.  If it didn't do that then the ability would give free mana since Soraka can also stand on the mana field.

I wouldn't have it scale off something that she absolutely doesn't need but instead have it be a stat the doesn't already take priority on soraka so she would have to choose what to build so max hp/mana, or you could just have low scaling ap, or MR if you really want to.\n\n> Ok, unless you are a champ with a ridiculously small mana pool (or this is pretty early game), a small skirmish does not remove all of your mana.
