Essentially, your own internet is a-okay, but the path it's trying to take to the EUW servers just isn't working out for something reason, whereas the path it takes to the PBE servers seems to work just fine. The fact that a VPN helps all but confirms this too (since a VPN also routes your connection in different ways).\n\nYou can tell your network to force your connection in a certain path by updating your DNS settings and port forwarding as well. Check out this [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for those steps, and test them in a custom game if you don't mind.","replies":[{"poster":"bGlXaJay","date":"2017-11-16T09:04:28.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've already updated my DNS, I've tried doing the port forwarding and nothing changed as well, I really don't know what to do anymore I tried almost everything, and for some reason every few websites il get one website that won't connect at all like the riot support websites or articles, where it says the connection was reset, it happens to other websites as well, any other suggestions to fix this? could this be a faulty router?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-16T21:51:15.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm if it's happening kinda randomly and it only pops up in short spurts, it kinda sounds like it could be caused by packet loss. Could you try running a quick traceroute using something like [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) to the EUW servers at 185.40.65.1 so we can get a better idea of how your connection looks?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mandr√©s","date":"2017-11-16T01:04:28.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've also been hit with this problem recently. Just to add some more info, for my problem at least - I've used the Hextech Repair Tool and it showed that everything was okay. I can log into PBE fine meanwhile the live Client gives issues. The authentication error is seemingly random, I haven't found any patterns for when it does and doesn't happen. With that said, it does only happen sometimes (for me at least), other times I can log in perfectly fine. \n\nI am using Campus Wifi, connected through ethernet (I figure this has something to do with it, however this has only begun happening very recently, as in within the past month. I was able to play league perfectly fine before then.) My roommate who also plays is able to log in sometimes when I am having this error, and other times I am able to log in when he encounters this error (we are both using ethernet). We are both always able to log into the PBE perfectly fine when either of us are experiencing this issue. \n\nI've encountered no fixes, trying the Hextech Repair Fool, enabling ports and disabling my firewall briefly. I have also tried a vpn with no luck. Sorry for seemingly taking over your thread - I just wanted to post about my similar problem and not make a new one for it!
