Rhia and Utility Backline are a diamond duo who are both support mains. We said fuck all them ADCs who tilted off the face of the Earth. We run bot lane the way we want it run. Fighting, and winning. Our bot lane combo is dubbed the Storm of the Century, and we are looking for eager storm chasers to come be a part of our fun. \r\n\r\nWhat will you find in our stream? Endless fighting. No AD champs. Sometimes Fiddlesticks! No Fake (weather) News!\r\n\r\nWe have no rules either. PC plebs are still welcome but they will find no trigger warnings. Come BM! \r\n\r\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-01-08T02:42:29.352+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like this idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Utility Backline","date":"2018-01-08T02:51:55.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=EBBIvmVK,discussion-id=ZimHhUqG,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-01-08T02:42:29.352+0000)\n>\n> I like this idea.\n\nWe've been doing it now for 2 weeks.

I also did more damage than their bot lane combined and Xerath did even more. Rofl you're a joke dude.

Kayn dealing more damage and ganking more is just the most obvious thing that could ever happen in a situation like this.\n2. You are Janna and Xerath. No shit you'll be doing more damage on the charts. All you do is just poke. Over time your damage dealt in lane adds up.

Its further proof of how much of a bonobo you are. Its why you have hundreds of games and are hardstuck platinum. \n\nClear as day you are on your main.\n\nRoasted.
