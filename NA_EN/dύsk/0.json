If you want your character to be visible, you will have to change your client's language to Greek.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have other questions for me.\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\nIs it my problem that they allow me to use greek characters on english client?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-16T23:58:58.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This board is designed for NA players, so overall the decision will be left up to the EU agents. Off the top of my head I would think this could be something easily fixed since, in the long run, the name change didn't work as you thought it would at first. I'd consider reaching back out to them to ask again if it'd be possible for any kind of help at all, but it will be left up to their discretion.","replies":[{"poster":"Dύsk","date":"2018-01-17T14:44:27.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry about that i have not noticed , So you think I am right yes? , when you pick up and check a new name its appears normally but soon you gonna find out that on a website and ingame its looks so different D'Ysk and DIsk :D close to what i picked yee sure :D","replies":[]}]}]}
