It doesn't mean your connection is shit, it's just that these things can be hella weird sometimes. There really isn't any end-all-be-all fix for these kinds of problems, and sometimes the first suggestion might not solve the issue, but we won't be able to help without a little work on your end as well.\n\nWhen the client isn't showing you that your game queue is ready, there's really only two possible things that could cause it. Either your installation of the client isn't working correctly at all, in which case those queue's will *never* pop for you because the files are damaged, or your network isn't able to see that the queue is ready because it doesn't have a steady connection with our servers. The way you described what's happening seems to really zone in on the fact that your client can't stay connected to our servers. It could be caused by a large number of different settings, so the only way we can really narrow this down is the go through [**each of these steps one by one**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). \n\nI know you're probably worried about getting kicked out a match and ending up stuck with penalties, so be sure to try these changes in custom games or the practice tool, that way you won't get hit with an LPQ or leaverbuster.","replies":[{"poster":"Asiaomo","date":"2017-05-30T13:03:51.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tried this stuff it didnt work i dont have ping issues or getting trying to recconect in middle of the game no its just in the launcher when ever i try to que ..","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sublymonal","date":"2017-05-06T04:18:16.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but to go from a legacy client with no connection issues to a new client with connection issues, how has the connection changed that much that it has jacked up a lot of our connections?","replies":[]}]}
