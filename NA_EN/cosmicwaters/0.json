With the movement of the SKT skins into patches where we already had content scheduled, we've been a bit full in terms of resources. \n\nI do apologize for the extremely long wait on this (you and I both feel the frustration here, as we both use this chroma pack a lot). We have it officially scheduled to be resolved. I'd be happy to give you more information as soon as we lock down a patch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CosmicWaters","date":"2016-06-30T05:47:11.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay stellar thank you so much!!\n\nBlu Koi Chroma is my my fav Nami skin so !\n\nthanks so much for taking the time out to reply to me! \n\nps I lov Deep Sea Nami it's so badass","replies":[]}]}
