(I actually sort by new!) :) \n\nThis bug actually hasn't been happening for over a year. It was resolved on July 30th, 2015, but it appears that the issue has re-occurred. I've just loaded her up in game, and you're correct that the particles are base, as opposed to the Koi Nami particles. I've gone ahead an re-opened this bug so we can get the proper particles added again.  ^-^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tysmin","date":"2016-05-26T00:09:57.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is intended it is the same for every chroma pack","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-26T17:30:57.006+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Nope - this actually isn't intended. ^-^ The chromas should use the particles of the parent skin.
