It sounds like your network might be having a hiccup updating your info.  Give your client a restart to resync, and let me know if it's still an issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Err0rnAmE","date":"2017-10-13T21:15:00.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After the second restart, it did update the mission.\n\nThank you very much for that, have a nice day!","replies":[]}]}]}
