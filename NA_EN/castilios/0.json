This can happen if your connection is specifically having problems with our services, in this case losing sync with champion select.  If you're on wifi, going wired will likely fix this up.  Otherwise, see if [power cycling ](https://kb.netgear.com/19755/How-to-Power-Cycle-Your-Home-Network?cid=wmt_netgear_organic)your router or [configuring your DNS ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)might help.  Test it in a custom game, though.","replies":[]}]}
