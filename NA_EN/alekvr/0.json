Too Harsh??????","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":1,"down_votes":17,"body":"Riot today decided to issue me a permanent ban after a I was reported for using harsh language in a game. I take it a bot reads the chat logs first because I was in a 4v5 with a troll and i feel like its fair for context to be understood in these games before issuing PERMANENT BANS.    My support was stealing my CS the entire game and feeding, this caused one of our other teammates to quit hence the 4v5. The game continues and I'm letting out some of my anger in chat cause i'm angry i'm stuck with a troll. Pretty normal. \r\n\r\n\r\nI get that I used harsh language. But I do not think what I said warrants a PERMANENT BAN especially given the circumstances. Everyone in  ranked is just trying to advance and to get stuck in a game with a troll and then get PERMANENTLY BANNED for it is rather egregious. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nAlekvr: is teemo jg actually legit/\r\nAlekvr: ive never seen it played\r\nAlekvr: y\r\nAlekvr: god dammit pyke y\r\nAlekvr: yeah no shit ur bad lol tone it down a little\r\nAlekvr: im ashe only better adc than me right now is cait\r\nAlekvr: we got this\r\nAlekvr: stop taking my CS\r\nAlekvr: OMG\r\nAlekvr: are u trolling pyke\r\nAlekvr: then sit under the fucking tower\r\nAlekvr: ur taking my farm and killing urself\r\nAlekvr: and ur kill stealing\r\nAlekvr: yes at 6\r\nAlekvr: PYKE STOP TAKING MY FARM\r\nAlekvr: FUCKING STOP\r\nAlekvr: omfg\r\nAlekvr: teemo he is literally stealing every last hit from me its not like 1 or 2\r\nAlekvr: and yes y did u not build a money item pyke????\r\nAlekvr: fucking stop taking my farm\r\nAlekvr: this fucking pyke\r\nAlekvr: kinda hard to do when my support is stealing CS and feeding for no damn reason\r\nAlekvr: pyke for gods sake stop taking my CS\r\nAlekvr: omfg u little fucking %%%%\r\nAlekvr: hes trolling\r\nAlekvr: probably has nothing better to do in his life\r\nAlekvr: god fuck you pyke\r\nAlekvr: can u guys report this pyke\r\nAlekvr: trolling\r\nAlekvr: stealing CS pretty much just giving u bot lane kills\r\nAlekvr: oh and not helping the\r\nAlekvr: no support item\r\nAlekvr: when do u want me to stop\r\nAlekvr: lol\r\nAlekvr: can u fucking do something useful pyke\r\nAlekvr: anything at all\r\nAlekvr: how? teemo isnt trolling\r\nAlekvr: sigh\r\nAlekvr: and all this fighting started with pyke\r\nAlekvr: yeah lets not surrender\r\nAlekvr: fuck you pyke\r\nAlekvr: i dunno\r\nAlekvr: llaoi ur joking right\r\nAlekvr: look at my name idiot\r\nAlekvr: im ashe\r\nAlekvr: i dunno teemo\r\nAlekvr: really just dont care and want this game to end\r\nAlekvr: oh nice GJ again pyke\r\nAlekvr: just end\r\nAlekvr: we are down a man too\r\nAlekvr: ......\r\nAlekvr: are u kidding its literally us 3 and pyke\r\nAlekvr: ya llaoi is pykes partner on this she isnt surrendering\r\nAlekvr: lol go fuck urself\r\nAlekvr: pinging for help\r\nAlekvr: can u guys hurry this up and end we have 2 trolls and are down a man\r\nAlekvr: they wont let us surrender\r\nAlekvr: llaoi i dont care u wont let us surrender\r\nAlekvr: fucking %%%%\r\nAlekvr: good one child\r\nAlekvr: ayyy way to fuck that up too llaoi\r\nAlekvr: god teemo i feel like my last 5 games ive been stuck with children\r\nAlekvr: lol\r\n\r\n\r\nI have had people say worse things to me over the state of a game and doubt they got permanently banned for it.

It will take longer because the punishments won't be automatically escalated, but it will have the same destination.\n\n1) Use chat to help your team win the game. \n\n2) Don't complain about the past. Time travel is stupidly expensive. No one is going to go change the past for you. So, it's only useful to talk about what to do NEXT.\n\n3) If someone is trolling, don't engage with them. Trolls get sexually excited when you get upset at them. Don't help them get off.\n\n------------------------\nThe punishment ladder goes:\n\nStarting Position\n10 Game Chat Restriction\n25 Game Chat Restriction\n14 Day Ban\nPermanent Ban\n\nWhen a punishment is issued, the next punishment in the list is given. Trolling is a 14 day ban on the first offense, as is using Zero Tolerance language. Punishment tiers do reset with time and games played with _good_ behavior. It takes 3 to 6 months of regularly playing with good behavior to reduce one penalty tier.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-12-23T17:03:28.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You may not think you should be punished for your behavior, but Riot thinks you should.
