I even am polite to those that are toxic to me. Given an example, I received a friend request from someone from a previous game, when accepted it, I got harrassed so I justr wished them good luck and sent a support ticket in for getting harrassed after game through private messages.\r\n\r\nI would like to hear as to why my account got a 2 week ban citing that \"an extensive audit of this account\" was given and that \"this is the only warning\", however. It claims that Riot wants to follow through with reforming players, but I got a straight out ban instead of a chat restriction, which I haven't gotten at all.\r\n\r\nLike I said, if I am wrong, I would rather not get smite online, and would actually like a personal response, maybe through some form of private message, but anything but the automated emails from the support staff would be great.","replies":[]}
