Hi, I am just a student who got banned from the ban wave last week. Forgive my English skills.\r\n.   I&#039;m living in a house with multiple students called dormitory. There are 2 strong PCs to use freely. I can play game, watch movie, everything (but porn) here if there is no one requires me to give one of the PCs to them. There are some guys here playing LOL same as me. One day, it is a storming day with ban wave, I got banned. I don&#039;t know what happening and when I check my mail, they say I used third party malicious or someshiit like that. I begin to research about the script.\r\n .  After doing for a while, I know I accidentally loaded shitty third party. But I don&#039;t use it, I even don&#039;t have any effect of them. Maybe I just use Curse. You can just watch my replays as http://www.replay.gg/search/na/iEatTheWorld# . I also stream in my facebook, one of the example is https://www.facebook.com/Nhi.hoang618/videos/192350841189102/ . There are many one else you can check in my facebook. My name was Nhi Nhi Simi before I change to  iEatTheWorld. \r\n.   I recognize that the game client never warns me if something wrong loading with it. And the Rito doesn&#039;t show any signal or anything if the script was loaded that people who use free PC like me can avoid. They just ban who inject it, even if those players used or not. So it is not fair. In the past, there are someone got banned by third party and get freed. Hey Rito, why don&#039;t you have any warn for people who first time loading script or accidentally load it? Why are there someone got banned and freed again but someone not? What are your conditions to get freed? Top up 10k$? NVM I&#039;m just tilted.\r\n.   I played this game for 5 years, try to step by step from an unrank player into diamond 4. And if you see my replays/old stream videos, you can see I can go higher, without script or cheat programs. There are no reason for me to use those shiits. I know there are many people have the same case as me. But Rito won&#039;t care. &quot;We will leave, they will die&quot;. \r\n.   I just quit LOL, it doesnt mean I quit moba game. I still playing game. Game is a part of my life. Cheat in the game is cheat my life. I&#039;m still looking for they answer, and I will leave this server. Hey RITO, you make mistake that you create a bad client that people can hack/bug/abuse on it, and now you ban those players by your faults. \r\n.   Goodbye, goodnight!","replies":[{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2016-09-21T06:54:12.661+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the main reason why you shouldn't use a computer that isn't yours. I understand you are a student, but even then that is just risking it if anyone can up and use the computer and do anything with it.\n\nBut even then it seems like you knew of 3rd party programs just didn't use them. That's one of the reason why riot doesn't want any part in it. Do you know how many people who do cheat play that card? Hell if all it took was \"I didn't use it\" everyone would be using it as an excuse. \n\nAlso I don't believe they should warn people with something that serious. I can understand toxic/trolling behavior because some times you just don't know. But with cheating you need to actually search and download these programs and have them work with the client. You know full well what you are doing and shouldn't have to be warn about cheating!","replies":[{"poster":"Verxint","date":"2016-09-21T17:21:08.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They take cheating/exploits so seriously that people have lost accounts for using exploits in custom games just to see what they were.\n\nIf you want to be safe don't use any intentional exploits and make sure you know everything on your computer.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"iEat The World","date":"2016-09-21T20:58:36.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your replies\nI know those, when I load my game client. I see something not correct and I immediately closed it. I'm worried that someone would hack my account.\nThat's why I wrote \"I don't use\". My case is just loading and close it. Not let it be loading during the match.\nI know many people say they don't cheat, but I require them to look at replay or should have more solution other than just ban. It's not fair at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-09-21T03:49:50.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/AEVP3NMA-anti-cheater-banwave-incoming\n\nThey did say it.  They just didnt make it front page news in the client because they have better things to promote in the main client.\n\nStill, they have made it pretty clear that they dont like 3rd party programs (with named exceptions like cv). if you knew you had something on there that might get you caught in the ban net then you should have gotten rid of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2016-09-21T03:40:46.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you want them to warn cheaters first? How long will they have to remove the third party program? Like warn them and give them 3 days? 1 day? What if they only play once a week... the warning wouldn't help them. If they give em 3 days warning that's 3 more days to spend cheating in games. What do you want them to do?!","replies":[]}]}
