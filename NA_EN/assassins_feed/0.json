What happens is that when I que I never find a match, or when I que with friends they get the matchup but yet I remain in an endless que, at which when they accept it instead says that I failed to accept the que. But that's not all, if I by some miracle manage to find a match the champion select dosen't work, atleast not well. It often says that it failed to save masteries, failed to pick a champ please try again or failed to lock champion please try again, and at the end I just freeze at 0 seconds for what I imagine an eternity feels like, if I'm lucky I can manage to join the game 5 mins later or if I'm not lucky I just can't join at all.\r\nI've tried a few things to fix this but without success so far, have anyone else experienced this? is there a fix or should I just give up? Any and all help is appreciated.\r\nPs. My network and router works fine as far as I can tell.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-09T23:21:10.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see a couple different issues here, but I want to make sure we go over each one.\n\nAbout those Q timers when you're queueing with friends, there's a pretty good chance that one of your friends didn't accept the Q. If one of your premade members dodges the Q you're in, I believe it will in fact reset your timer (since someone in the group dodged). Make sure you're waiting our the whole LPQ and accepting the match that follows to rid out of low-priority.\n\nWhen you get into champ select and can't choose anyone and the timer freezes at 0, it really sounds like your network is having a hard time communicating with our servers. It could just be due to some awkward [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), but you could also try using a hardwired connection if you aren't already to see if that helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Flemman","date":"2017-06-10T05:36:39.040+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the fact that there is many poeple getting it recently is maybe the sign their is a problem on your end too tho :p\n\njust had it 2 time in a raw yestarday as I was first pick (seems to occure only when it's the case). I could ban a champ during banning phase (so the connection to champ data must be right at that time) but the arrow for picking a champ wasn't there after that.\n\nAny chance that it's related to new coding for pre game lobby? I didn't change my network setting in years so I find it pretty suspicious that there is this global bug now appearing despise the fact i change nothing\n\nin case you miss it, link to a thread with multiple case of this first pick bug\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/LP0TKmZr-champion-list-not-appearing-in-select","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MapleTwigofGOOD","date":"2017-06-09T14:15:51.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been experiencing this too but I have no idea how to fix it ;-;","replies":[]}]}
