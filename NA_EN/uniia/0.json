I tried this 2 or 3 times and same thing happened every time.\n\nI tried disabling windows firewall(only one i have) and it didnt help. I was able to login into EUNE earlier today after multiple tries, but now that doesnt seem to work anymore. I have tried restarting computer and my modem but those havent helped.\n\nI suspect this could be connected to a windows update that happened recently, but im quite confused about usually being able to log into EUW but being blocked from EUNE.\n\nEDIT: Got into EUNE again.","replies":[]}]}]}
