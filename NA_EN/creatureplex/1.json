No matter your adc, or your support choice, fuck you guys make playing Tristana kind of hard when you got a lulu and jhin that just eat up your braum because the fucking idiot and I quote just started playing again didn&#039;t bother to check his mastery pages/meaning he didn&#039;t even have 1....... bronze for life! \r\n\r\nQuestion of the day, what do you do as a team when your bot lane is forced to hug turret because the enemy adc/support is just pushing them back and all in kill or nothing type of playstyle? \r\n\r\nSee I always thought that in this type of situation me Tristana, and a Braum vs a Jhin and Lulu, from the start to Jhin&#039;s first 4 kills only 2 of them being on me btw, that the best and really the only way to deal with a kill lane is to let them push and overextend and let your jungler pitch a tent and snowball off crappy all-in idiots. So I just like to try to understand I&#039;m getting bullied can&#039;t farm worth shit because as soon as I step up my Braum gets wrecked hard by Jhin and Lulu and has to blue pill while I take quite the beating myself, what am I supposed to do during this situation? \r\n\r\nI hug turret and lose a shit ton of farm and try not dying I&#039;m pretty sure that&#039;s all I can do, but isn&#039;t my jungler supposed to punish them for this type of gameplay, shouldn&#039;t my Yasuo mid which is constantly pushing his wave to enemy tower be roaming trying to get kills on this overly aggressive bot lane? \r\n\r\nPlease correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but isn&#039;t this how you are supposed to handle an overly aggressive kill lane? Take advantage of them over extending and punish them for playing too aggressively, or at least spend their flashs possibly at least push them back so I could push my lane just a bit.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-10-16T10:08:22.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you don't let them get kills you will definately out scale them.\n\nTry asking specific members of your team politely for ganks and try to maintain your health levels and keep map awareness so you can help when they get there.\n\nDon't be too afraid to cover your support with attacks if he gets caught a bit. Softening them up makes them look tastier to your teammates.","replies":[{"poster":"creatureplex","date":"2016-10-16T10:27:54.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I couldn't farm that Jhin and Lulu seem like they were perfectly intent on just pushing bot lane for as long as my team would allow it and my team didn't feel any urgency to come bot at all, so I was completely starved.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-10-16T13:16:15.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Farm under turret with your lane pushed.

Just from a quick look at your match history it is pretty obvious that you ragequit/afked/trolled that game. And you still have the nerve to complain about other players? Braum, unlike you, actually contributed something to that game.\n\nAnyway, what could you have done?\n\nJust survive the lane. Jhin starts to snowball pretty fast and you got Ivern as jungle....yeeeee. If Jhin gets a kill first, just go into survival mode.  If they push the tower, that's fine. They will propably rotate mid and take mid as well, but there is nothing you can do about that anyway. Once the midgame starts you push sidelanes solo and you do nothing else. Try to cover yourself with wards. Tristana is extremely good for that. She can push waves fast and can jump away if anyone tries to collapse on her. You also still got your ultimate if things go bad. It will take some time, but you will get back into the game for sure.","replies":[{"poster":"creatureplex","date":"2016-10-16T10:24:02.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No I quit because I asked jungle and mid to bounce bot yasuo was dominating mid lane and we could use the help kept pinging it ivern came down once and had a chance to kill a jhin with only 2 kills at the time braum was fighting like a champ i had just died for my first time, and braum hit his slow proct his passive one more auto and jhin would of been stunned, but instead of ivern autoing him, instead he backed out jhin killed braum as a result and was able to get out of the situation then for some reason ivern decided to chase jhin taking a shit ton of damage from a full health lulu and jhin killed him giving jhin 4 kills and his first blue pill, came back in lane right away my braum died, I hugged turret they tower dove me and killed me easily like really easily needless to say didn't have much farm. And we lost our tower, and it's bronze jhin already had 6 kills 0 deaths our jungler was useless and our yasuo only had 1 kill. But I kept going for a little bit, lulu and Jhin pressed our second tower, and we lost it, and still for some reason our jungler and mid didn't think it was necessary to come bot and help out instead got told to stop dying so much mind you at this point I had only died a few times, so yeah I raged quit. I know full heartily that as an adc, if I get starved I'm fucking because their jungler now is going to do everything he can to make sure I can't catch up.","replies":[]}]}]}
