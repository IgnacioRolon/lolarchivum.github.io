So last thing you want is your adc to die.......so your team needs to make sure the heavy assassins that are playing in bronze can&#039;t get to your fucking ashe, the more you protect your adc, your chances of winning increase.\n\nAPC-Ability Power Carry otherwise known as a mage, not a support, but an apc that&#039;s building ability power, Ziggs, Xerath great examples. They rely solely on their abilities usually throwing down abilities into combos, they force the enemy team to build MR so that late game your adc can do damage without being resisted, this is especially true to those pesky players that love playing Assassins mid, some exceptions like Katarina and Kassadin are different because they are also mages. \n\nTank-Okay this one is obvious soak damage and usually in the front lines, should be anyways.......If you are Nasus, Garen, even Darius, a lot of people don&#039;t know this but they can tank, they aren&#039;t just bruisers.....Build defensively and hold the line, keep assassins off your carries, and take the damage, you should be the first one in, and the last one to leave the fight.......Okay.......okay so why are you chasing through the enemy jungle after Master Yi, how about instead you stay in front and trust that your team will win this team fight, if you are to die, so be it, at least all the damage is being done to you and not the rest of your team. \n\nBruiser/Off-Tank- You are not an assassin your job is to disrupt any frontline they may have. Get through get to the carry if you can if not fine disrupt the front line spread them up, make it easier for your team to prioritize targets. Vi, Xin Zhao are great examples of brusers, don&#039;t go chasing down the adc, stay in the fight beat up some people and push the adc away from their team, so that your assassins can take care them easier. \n\nAssassins-Your not the carries, you will not be doing the most damage, you might have the most kills but you aren&#039;t the damage dealer, your job, see that Ashe, and that Morgana, your job get to them, kill them, chase them until you kill them or you die, keep them away from the team fight, be smart don&#039;t go in knowing your going to die. Assassinate your target get out of there, come back after your abilities are off cooldown and take out another target.\n\nSupport-You are the team&#039;s mom, or dad whatever........your main goal is to watch over your team be that wall like Braum, initiate the fight like Leona, pop that game changing ult like Soraka, aoe their entire team like Sona.......keep assassins off your carries, that is your main goal, it&#039;s not the early game anymore.....so what your job doesn&#039;t change, why are you Morgana running after Jinx? Stay here and ult their fucking team spread them apart shit.\n\nTheir is your roles on a fucking pedestal!\n\nAnd then their is the infamous hyper carries, Master Yi, Yasuo, okay these champions most of them were design before the current meta came into existence, every since that meta, Master Yi, and several hypercarries aren't viable later in the game stages, say gold and above with well coordination not seen in low level play Master Yi as well as a lot of these type of champions don't do so well. I like to consider them as cheese champions kind of like a 6-pool for Zerg against Terran, it works sometimes, it might even be able to get you out of bronze but once you get to silver maybe gold, and that's a big if........you'll be shot right back at the bottom because instead of mastering more team oriented type champions, you chose to master Master Yi useless pass bronze and silver. Reason being unless fed, they serve no purpose in the game.....like a 6 pool if it fails the game is as good as over, same with these type of champions. Yasuo is one the few champions that can hyper carry a team in bronze and is still useful in all stages of the game, he no longer would be considered a hyper carry in gold and above and becomes a strong assassin/Bruiser depending on how he builds.

Their is a huge variance in skill when it comes to bronze a huge gap, that unless you are a bronze player you wouldn't know. Plat level players completely different they don't chase, they know the basic rules, that's why they're in plat but everyone there knows that. \n\nI'm in bronze because I sucked, I'm improving but I main adc, and if my team doesn't peel for me or spend some effort on keeping assassins and such from doing their job to me, I'm not going to be very effective. \"Well play Ezreal or some shit, I'm sorry I'm not going to play Ezreal because other players don't know how to play their champions or don't understand this game very well. I make mistakes, I try to learn from them, but I can take a horse to water, it's up to the horse to drink the water. Our last game was one of those games where if my support bought supportive items, I would of snowballed and probably won the game for my team in less than 20 minutes she went full ap which really punished me. She cared more about getting a kill than protecting me, which as a support is really selfish play style. And I never once exempted myself if you bother reading further up on comments I said what separates me from other high level players are those slight mistakes that I make. \n\nAnd I like to look at it like a guideline what I posted, and has nothing to do with actually insulting others.......I considered it like basic rules of lol follow these and we'll get out of bronze, we'll win this game.........Trying to describe these things to others is almost like talking to a wall. This one game, I'm Ashe I'm doing alright, but I have no front line because every team fight my Trundle is off split pushing..........I'm holding mid top lane what ever lane I need to hoping Trundle, you coming dude......What happens when you Ashe and you have no support, or tank by you and Fizz/Zedd/Akali jump on you? You die, now I know that so I know I'm not going to put myself in a position to let that happen, but because I have no front line, I can't proceed so I'm getting backed up, avoiding skill shots, but eventually one is going to hit me, and if I have no tank or support I'm as good as dead.","replies":[{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2018-04-02T17:55:08.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=creatureplex,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=J2u2QvFU,comment-id=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-04-02T07:24:05.739+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;ve seen gold players play like bronze watch youtube videos of players that are bronzies that are actually pretty damn good just make a few mistakes in a game that your typical plat player or so wouldn&#x27;t make.

Sorry but you are playing with and against bronze players. If you are improving like you say you are you would know what to do against those bronze players. Smurfs and many others make a bronze challenge and they get over that rank in little to no time at all... you not being over bronze should already tell you that you have not improved enough. There is always something you can do to improve. Whether that means better map awareness, better positioning, better build paths, better targeting or something else. There is always something to do to improve yourself.

Simple as that. You are playing with those players I don't care what you think about yourself, I don't care that is your teammates fault that you are stuck in bronze. You are the sole reason you are stuck where you are not your teammates or the enemies you face, you are not good enough to be anywhere else but bronze atm.

Do I deserve bronze, IDK maybe I know when I first got placed there, I sure in the hell did, I sucked badly. Didn't ward properly didn't understand trading and counter picks, played with a large champion pool, and did like most bronze players won some games lost some games. Right now I've played 5 games, I've won 4 of them......3 of them with Ashe with a crappy ass team if I may add........my supports going full ap, my tanks split pushing, my team feeding I've seen it all. I will never say I was the only reason we won those games, shit I didn't even ditch out the most damage in some of those games......But I kited well avoided death, made some plays built base off of situations, and most of all kept my deaths relatively low despite my team not peeling or offering any type of protection from assassins. Did I play a big role in the reason we won those games, I say yeah I did a hell of a job, was I the only reason no........But I will say I didn't get carried, I pulled my weight and always do the best that I can with what I have.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BigBellBrute","date":"2018-04-03T00:32:14.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=creatureplex,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=J2u2QvFU,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-04-01T01:49:49.097+0000)\n>\n> Shit post?

Supports can be to blame for a loss but no more than any other role in the game. Supports suck if they have a shitty adc, they won't shine very well, and supports can be counter as well to, for instance, yesterday I went Thresh into Tahm Kench......I wasn't really able  to do much I played safe kept Caitlyn away from Jinx, and we lost it happens to the best of us.

But if they don't and blatantly ignore me it kind of sucks.
