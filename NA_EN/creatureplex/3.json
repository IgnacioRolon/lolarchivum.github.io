I want to be able to be aggressive but still be able to protect my adc, I like Leona for that regard, tanky, great initiation, great cc, and has a strong kit design to protect my adc, problem is she costs 4800 blue essence and I only have 4100 :( and unlike the old system, I don&#039;t get blue essence every game, so it takes awhile to build up again.","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-04-06T05:51:04.369+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Braum.\ntheres no better support for your needs.","replies":[{"poster":"creatureplex","date":"2018-04-06T07:17:35.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=breakordoom444,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jt5eyEkQ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-04-06T05:51:04.369+0000)\n>\n> Braum.\n> theres no better support for your needs.\n\nI do really like him but he's 6300 BE and it takes a long time to build up to that, I chose Shen instead I like his playstyle a little supportive great tenacity and cc, and still has ways of dealing with jungle ganks while being able to tank in team fights mid to late game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2018-04-06T07:21:48.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:44}} \n\n1350 BE\nCan half health an adc with a stun and 2 autos at level 1\nHas a stun\nHas a shield\nHas a heal\nHas invulnerability\nBest all-in in the game\nCan play passively as a guard for your own squishies or can go ham with cooldown resets","replies":[{"poster":"creatureplex","date":"2018-04-06T08:02:30.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AlienPrimate,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jt5eyEkQ,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-04-06T07:21:48.472+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:44}} \n> \n> 1350 BE\n> Can half health an adc with a stun and 2 autos at level 1\n> Has a stun\n> Has a shield\n> Has a heal\n> Has invulnerability\n> Best all-in in the game\n> Can play passively as a guard for your own squishies or can go ham with cooldown resets\n\nYeah but Taric is like Thresh good off-tank but he's not really a tank, I found Shen and only play 3 games with him and I like him he fits very well with my playstyle.","replies":[{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2018-04-06T08:19:27.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While he doesn't have the raw stats of a tank, he is still very tanky due to his constant heals and shields.  As a support, I often heal for more damage than I take as well as mitigate just as much, if not more damage than my top laner.  When I go top lane with him, I heal for quite a bit less due to mostly just healing myself but usually mitigate about 2 or 3 times the second most.  You may see Taric and think he only has 2500 HP and that he isn't all that tanky, but by time he dies he should easily shield at least 36% of his max life and heal for around 1k.  This means his actual effective HP in a lost fight should be around 4400 without his high resistances.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord of Math","date":"2018-04-06T07:20:55.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:14}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:44}}","replies":[]}]}
