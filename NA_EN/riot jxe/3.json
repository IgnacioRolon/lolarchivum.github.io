First I get like 250-270 fps, then minion spawn and it lowers a bit and when the second wave spawn I go down to 150 and 200 fps once minions aren't on screen anymore. But at that point there shouldn't be more \"things\" on the map at once since there is already 2 waves of creeps alive, and still the fps goes down every wave even if it's just a bit. So even tho I don't actually know how it works I wonder if minions are still loaded even after their death. \nAlso between spawn and lane there is almost a 200 fps difference (270->100) and I know that a lot more things are loaded on lane and in real game but, I feel like it's not supposed to drop fps by THAT much, if I can have more than 250 fps by looking anywhere on the map why are 1 champion and 5 creeps all it takes to divide fps by 2 ? Ok maybe we actually load everything even if we don't look at it but still I don't see why champions and units reduce fps by that much when it feels like the summoner's rift might be way harder to load actually. But maybe that's really the way it's supposed to work idk.\n\nAlso since fps drop a lot in lane too even in custom games I think it's not a special case about teamfight anomation and so on but something really basic either about the map or minions or champions or timers...\n\nIsn't it possible to see what does the render in a console with logs or something like that ? If not is it possible to create a tool to do it ? (Maybe it would reduce performance but its only purpose would be for you to see if there are loops or compare it with old patchs or things that goes wrong in the way the game render) that way even if it takes time to build it you will always have an easier time to fix things in the future.\n\nMy pc specs : windows 10 64 bits\nNvidia 960m 4gb vram latest driver atm something like 388.43 I believe, I7 4720hq, playing on SSD.

Force closing it seems to help, but then I have to log in again after every match.  However I don't think this is everything, and randomly guessing as a programmer myself, I would think it's related to the fact that there are 3-5 processes related to league running at once for some reason.  Honestly the client itself using over a gig of ram is kind of ridiculous when not in a match, everything it does could be handled as simple html5 with local assets.  it's just text and pictures\n\non the flipside being cautious of this lag has made mejai's stacks easier to retain.

Some games are worse than others. I used to have over 200 FPS and now my best seems to be about 150 and it's sometimes dropping to 30 in teamfights. For an example, on one of my recent streams, just pick a random time like the ten minute period between 01:40:00 to 01:50:00 and watch the variability in my FPS... randomly jumping around between 60 and 120: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/204762999","replies":[]},{"poster":"korg023","date":"2017-11-28T11:18:44.918+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"What do you mean it cant be reproduced?
