The ping spikes seem only to be with League of Legends as none of us have noticed lag issues on any other games or in our voice calls. It usually happens at least once every game and if we're playing with friends in the same game it happens at the same time to all of us. It's making Lol unplayable and it's caused me to dodge out of champ select a few times due to the spike. \r\nAnybody else noticing this?","replies":[{"poster":"Megagig","date":"2016-08-26T18:19:12.233+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here.

I love the copy paste response from the rioter as well. Makes you feel like they are really dedicated to fixing your problem and not at all ignoring it till it reaches a critical number of affected users.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SaxonMan","date":"2018-03-10T19:32:33.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this happens to me about 2-5 times per match. I will DC for about 20 -30 seconds and my ping will spike to 8000 at times. At first i thought it was my internet connection but like you, it only happens with LOL. it started happening about 3 days ago and hasn't stopped since.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JLingz","date":"2017-09-05T01:58:45.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, I am so fed up with playing with this ping spikes every 1 out of 3 games, and it's making me just quit playing league anymore. I know I spent lots of money to support them to fix these kind of problems, but it seems never going to get fixed. Especially when playing Ranked, it really pisses me off and make me blame Riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zrandon","date":"2016-08-27T19:22:24.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the exact same issues, and I just had a Charter Tech at my home (Minnesota) and he said there is no issue on their side.

If the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) hasn't been able to help or possibly due to an ISP issue, submit a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to us so we can get more context and information for this and find a solution.
