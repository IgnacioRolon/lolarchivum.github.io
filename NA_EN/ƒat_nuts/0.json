I've summited bug reports and a ticket but no one seems to care.\r\n* I've been leave-busted 3 times now because the client decides it wants to repair every single file in the game when I try to enter the loading screen. It's very irritating I'm losing LP and probably affecting my honor score it's not fair and needs to be fixed because I'm 100% positive I'm not the only one experiencing that crap, I love this game but I don't want to play anymore...","replies":[{"poster":"ƒat nuts","date":"2017-07-26T17:36:44.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I really enjoy the help I'm not getting thanks for making this gaming experience amazing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ƒat nuts","date":"2017-07-24T02:10:24.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello...?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-08T03:29:15.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your client is needing to repair that often, you may want to take a step back to figure out just what exactly is going wrong.
