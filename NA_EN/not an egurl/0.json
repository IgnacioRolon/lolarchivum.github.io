I bought the region switch and it stated that the login name ----- was taken on NA which it is, its my NA alt which im using right now as i cant log onto my account. So i changed my login name to --------- as that was free. I then checked and my username ------- was not taken on NA so i was set to go. I began the account transfer and all was going well, i logged onto the NA servers just fine but then realised that my in game name was --------. I was like ehh, so i relogged my client and went to log back in and it said the username or password is incorrect. My username is -------- as i had to change it as fluhi was taken and my password is 1000% correct. Im not really sure what to do, i cant even log onto my account on the forums and i really want to get back to playing league. I've spent loads of money over time on league and really cannot afford to lose my account, please can someone help me get this fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-27T20:43:33.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went ahead and edited out all the mentions of your username, you should keep that private to help keep your account safe and secure. \n\nWith that out of the way, I checked up on this and it looks like the username you're using isn't quite the right one that you created for the NA server. Hit up [**this website**](https://account.leagueoflegends.com/eune/en/forgot-username) and you'll be able to recover that username to your signup email!","replies":[]},{"poster":"not an egurl","date":"2017-07-25T19:08:08.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When i log into EUW ---------------- and NA -------------------------","replies":[]}]}
