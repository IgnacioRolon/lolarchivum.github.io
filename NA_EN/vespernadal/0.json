This is fine and dandy and I can agree to this change since I don&#039;t need vulgar language to convey my point of view but for this post I&#039;m going to use some of it because I feel like it. I&#039;m not that mad about you making this change, but I am  PISSED that you do it spontaneously and without warning. Pulling shit like this is highly unprofessional in your line of work as this is the kind of moderation I do have a problem with. We told you in prior threads that one thing we would like to see more of is some transparency on your end. When you make rule changes without warning you are being very non-transparent. You already done fucked this up twice now. I want to see this change updated into the board ettiqutte sticky on the side of the page. I also want to see a post from one of you mods about this change. And I want to see this \"heads up we&#039;re changing stuff again\" PRIOR TO MAKING THE FUCKING CHANGES. It&#039;s too late now, but is it so hard to publicize your changes ahead of time?","replies":[]}
