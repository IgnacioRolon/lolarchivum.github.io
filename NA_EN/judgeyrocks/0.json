I know this message is a bit late to help you, BUT if you ever run into this issue again and you end up in a ghost game just wait about 2 hours and the issue should clear up. \n\nHope you're back in the Rift slaying some Champ's. Good luck. \n\n{{champion:25}} {{summoner:4}} {{item:3157}}","replies":[]}]}
