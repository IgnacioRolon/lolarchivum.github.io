I also tried other games to look if its my pc thats dying but those still run fine. to give a good idea how the game runs its like the units dont move smooth and slender when they move.\r\n\r\ni hope you can can do something about this, and otherwise thats just bad luck for me. {{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-15T02:43:23.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you've already disabled the Snowdown assets through the in-match settings, this might actually be something more driver related rather than your pc just dying xP. Do me a favor and double check your graphics and directX drivers to make sure they are still fully updated.
