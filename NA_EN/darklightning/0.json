I was robbed of RP","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"... when I purchased a ward skin. Seriously. Ward skins need to be around 200 RP.\r\n\r\n\r\nRight now I agonize over buying one... and the single ward I can recall purchasing was for my main champion. Now I have regrets since I've moved into the jungle. It isn't reasonable that I have to pay more for a ward skin than I would have to for some champion skins. In the very least you should have ward skin sales at 50% off. That temps me to spend my hard earned real money on vanity items. WARDS ARE INVISIBLE TO HALF THE PLAYERS IN A GAME... and most of the time you don 't give them a second glance. The \"dude, cool skin\" factor is too low for the current pricing structure. Obviously... you are making money at the current rate... but when you start getting desperate for some more money, consider this. Right now I wouldn't buy a single ward skin without agonizing over it... if you dropped the price, I would likely buy 3-4. I can't even use 3-4 per game. I want a skin ward with my favorite champion to highlight I value this champion. Right now that isn't likely to happen.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for reading. ...and if you didn't read it all  {insert insul}> :P\r\n\r\nKeep up the good work Riot... I generally love your game.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-11T23:54:28.636+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can refund certain purchases within 90 days of their purchase date, according to our [Refund Policy.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751864-Content-Refund-FAQ#h1) This means you can refund a ward skin if you don't enjoy it, so long as you have a refund token available and do so within 90 days.\n\nIf you'd like to leave feedback on this, feel free to on the [Miscellaneous Boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous), where it should also get more visibility.\n\nHelp & Support is a section of the boards where *Porocles* and I address technical issues or general questions about the game.

You should have thought about wards being not visible or having low visibility most of the time when you bought the ward skin. Also they cost a bit more than expected because ward skins are not champ specific and can be used by any of them.","replies":[{"poster":"Darklightning","date":"2016-10-23T19:26:39.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Clearly you skim.
