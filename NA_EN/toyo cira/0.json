Its therefore possible for your oc settings to be stable in certain situations are not in others.\nExample I OC'd my graphics are a couple months ago, settings were stable in most games but would randomly crash sometimes in Heroes of the Storm.\n\nId recommend you google overclocking guides for your specific CPU. Keep in mind that with regards to overclocking, different batches of the same chips will OC differently. The quality of each chip is not the same, some OC better than others, its ultimately a lottery and you can get a good or bad chip. You therefore need to thoroughly test what settings work for your specific cpu and not just randomly assign clock speed and voltage.\n\nIf you dont have it already id recommend downloading CPUID HWMonitor and monitor the temps of your CPU at load.\n\nUltimately you should try lowering your clock to 4.4 and the voltage by a bit and seeing if this fixes your problems.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Víaggro","date":"2016-06-07T19:57:54.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Easy fix...revert the overclock to normal settings and read up some more on how to OC correctly. While 50c isn't to high that doesn't mean that the OC is stable. Starting from factory increase the clock speeds .1ghz and just prime95 for awhile, if it doesn't crash raise it another .1ghz. Repeat until it crashes. Then if you want you can try and raise the voltage a little bit and do the whole thing over again. DO NOT RAISE THE VOLTAGE IF YOU HAVE STOCK COOLER!!!!! On that note because he didn't mention the cooling setup you have, if you only have a stock CPU cooler you aren't really going to be able to overclock that much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2016-06-07T07:58:30.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What are your OC settings? How many Volts are you pumping into your CPU? What is your CPU cooling solution? And what other games have you tested?\n\nAdditionally, other, newer games are likely not as dependant on the CPU. I suspect, given how the LoL client is looking and feeling, that this game is more CPU dependant than others. But even so, a PC shouldn't just shut down unless A) it's overheating, or B) your OC is unstable at load.\n\nhttp://www.tomshardware.co.uk/answers/id-2207262/safe-voltage-amd-8350-5ghz.html\nhttp://www.overclock.net/t/1318995/official-fx-8320-fx-8350-vishera-owners-club\n\nI tried some OCing on my previous CPU, an Intel Core-2 Quad Extreme QX9650, but while it took a ~33% OC (from 3.0 to 4.0 GHz), it wasn't stable then. Under CPU load, my PC also shut down. So the OC was reduced to 3.8 GHz, and was tested stable at that speed (but with a 7°C increase on the cores).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nausicäa ","date":"2016-06-07T04:05:08.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you experienced in overclocking? Did you test proper voltages for that OC because it sounds like it might not be stable.\n\nTry increasing the voltage assuming its within the safe limits for that CPU, otherwise lower your OC until its stable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-07T01:13:23.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When a computer instantly shuts down instantly, it usually is a result of overheating.
