That isn't really important though. It's stupid that 2 master players got matched with unranked not even level 30 players. The matchmaking in normals is horrendous and I think Riot should take rank in account for normals at least slightly. This is a big reason why low levels have a hard time leveling up and can definitely sway some players away. No one likes being stomped by players who are far superior. It's just not fun.\n\nAlso this Hecarim was also a smurf, so that also helped us win.","replies":[{"poster":"MosesTheTroll","date":"2016-05-18T14:34:09.330+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not a fan of Riot lately, but it sounds like Riot got it right.
