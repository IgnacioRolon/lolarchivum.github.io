Vigorous Gaming is a community that brings players together and makes them into serious rank teams with their own channels, GFX, and coaching for free! \nTo keep everything short and simple we are looking for serious players to make a rank 5's team. I will add the application and requirements below. If we are interested in your application I will contact you on League so please DON'T add me in game.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n* *Gold Rank*\n* *Serious*\n* *Social*\n* *Can make practice*\n* *Flexible Schedule*\n* *Possible Leader*\n*  *Teamspeak*\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Application:**\n\n*Nickname:*\n*Age:*\n*Rank:*\n*Timezone:*\n*Shot calling ability:*\n* Desired Role:*\n*Are you a Leader:*\n*Why we should pick you:*\n*Do you agree with the requirements: *\n\n \nThanks for taking time out of your day to fill out this application I hope to hear from you soon!! -*Detroit* &lt;3\nYou will be added by a account named Detroit Gaming because my main account is cluttered.","replies":[{"poster":"Eudocia","date":"2015-04-15T00:06:35.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eudocia","date":"2015-04-07T21:10:28.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Demonfear4565","date":"2015-04-01T22:31:07.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nickname: Demonfear4565\nAge: 20 \nRank: gold 4\nTimezone: EST\nShot calling ability: okay XD\nDesired Role: mid\nAre you a Leader: Yup :D\nWhy we should pick you: I am dedicated and willing to improve!\nDo you agree with the requirements:yes","replies":[]},{"poster":"PrimeeTimee","date":"2015-03-31T13:07:42.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am a jungle / support main and gold on two accounts.\n\nJungle: I main amumu with 70% win rate but can play most other jungles including vi, j4, olaf, malphite, wu, lee, sej, graggy, yi, fizz ect. I prefer to play amumu/malphite/sej if my team needs AP and wukong/vi/j4 if my team needs AD. I just seem to have higher win rates with those champions as I can carry games by myself when needed in soloqueue. However on a 5's team last season we got to gold and I played team based jungles mostly. My champion pool is very diverse in the jungle and my map awareness and team fighting is exceptionally strong. I have over 2000 games played over 3 seasons on two different accounts.\nSupport: In season 3 I mained support for a gold 5's team and I enjoy playing janna, morgana, nami, Leona, thresh, velkoz. I play most supports at a gold-plat level but I play those 6 the most. I pride myself on my map awareness as a support in the bot lane and I know when and how to roam to get vision and assist in jungle / mid lane when the opportunity arises. I have carried many games in the support role through proper vision placement and team fight knowledge.\n\nThank you for reading and if you or your team have any interest in adding me please contact me in game and also leave your information here so I know that people are interested in letting me try out.\n\nI am looking for gold+ teammates and can play nightly from 8pm est to 10pm est and then most weekends. I am an adult 28+ so would prefer an adult team or atleast 18+, no kids.\n\nhttp://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/36757452#ranked-stats (zedi master)\n\nMy account arihm has few ranked games at the moment as I have been playing around on my smurf account trying new champs and lanes just for fun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Purge the Serge","date":"2015-03-31T10:13:37.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: Drentish\nAge: 16 (in 3 weeks)\nTimezone: EST \nRank: Currently P4 (been fluctuating between P4 and P3 as I've been quite unlucky with leavers RIP)\nShotcalling: If I'm jungle, it's mostly dive calls and objective control, for mid and top laners it's usually when i roam, turret dives, and fight initiation. The one downfall i have is that if i tell someone to go in, i need them to trust me because usually i can't accomplish whatever the task is without their help (it's cost me a few deathless games)\nDesired Role: Mid>Jungle>Top, I have no problem playing any of those 3, I just prefer my AD and AP Assassins\nAre you a leader: Like i mentioned before, I love to dive so i will gladly lead, but i do need follow up support. I can do general shot calling before late game lvl 18 group and roam. It's usually not a good idea to have your hyper aggressive assassin player make late gamedecisions. \nWhy I'm \"the very best, like no one ever waaaas\": I have extremely solid lane mechanics. I know most matchups on my favorite characters,I have extremely strong last hitting (600 stack Nasus at 27 minutes and other champs hitting 250 cs at 20 minutes), I'll always have a presence in the game (get camped,no problem, safe last hit and use those behaviors for money), and I can easily play against diamond solo laners as long as I didn't get completely counter picked (or if i don't know the matchup).\nIGN: Drentish \nDo you agree with requirements: I completely agree except as a student with some after school activities, my schedule isn't that flexible","replies":[]},{"poster":"fapfapfap","date":"2015-03-31T09:52:45.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nickname: Hanlin\nAge: 23\nRank: Gold 3\nTimezone: California/Pacific\nShot calling ability: Objective control and when to go for baron/dragon/baserace\nDesired Role: ADC\nAre you a Leader: I'm a decent shotcaller for teamfights and objectives, although I would prefer to follow than to lead. I like to ping alot what i want the team to do.\nWhy we should pick you: My main account is currently in Silver 3(2 bouncing back and forth), but on my smurf that I created and leveled up from scratch I have achieved Gold 3 rank by going 9-1 in my provisionals only soloque, no duo(I don't like duos). The highest rank I have gotten on my main is SIlver 1. Still working on getting my main account into Gold as well. I think it's impressive(maybe, not really) that I was able to go 9-1 in my provisionals vs Golds and Plats with barely any runes. I am aiming for Diamond this season on 3 accounts. I'm looking to improve and hoping that in joining this team, I can learn alot and improve my play and game sense.\nMain IGN: Hanlinn\nSmurf IGN: Hanlin\nDo you agree with the requirements:\n\nYes I agree with the said requirements.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LostBast","date":"2015-03-31T06:58:31.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would definitely like to try out for you!
