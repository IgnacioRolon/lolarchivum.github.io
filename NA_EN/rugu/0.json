If they buffed the trinkets to absolutely best SS (or at least equal it) and removed consumable wards/SS it would be an early game buff to JG as they would only have to worry about weak starting trinket.  Teams would also have to make trades between sweeping, regular wards, and pink wards.  for example, weighting the benefit of say having 2 dudes sweeping, one dude placing pinks, and 2 placing reg wards (in effect having a max of 7 wards on the map) vs a team of all reg warders (15 wards on the map, but no ability to destroy them or detect stealth.  This could keep the vision game rather dynamic, and probably encourage more warding in general because trinket is more painless than individual wards (which have the stigma of 'if nothing happens in 3 min, or I place badly it's a waste) and less expensive than SS.  Furthermore, it allows teams that have gotten to full build late game and thus have no item slots (rare, but it does happen) to continue the vision game with the buffed trinkets.  Heck I'd be in full support of everyone starting with some kind of free trinket between the current and SS, simply because it would help remove a big source of toxicity from the game by making it painless and free while still offering the tactical diversity of which trinket you choose, when, and how well you use it.","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-02-19T22:19:07.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having to wait until lv 9 isn't a cost in the sense that i had intended, i mean to say that there should be a tradeoff for getting vision.

If you buff trinkets to the point of sightstone where anyone can supplement one players lack of warding, then you can basically remove the fog of war permanently and that is not good. \n\nI will also mention that if your ward is placed for 3 min and it doesn't see anything, That is 3 min of guaranteed safety and that is information that has been gained and can be used effectively. \n\nAs for the late-late game regime that you mention it might be reasonable for the trinkets to be twice upgradeable, with an additional gold cost to give greater functionality unlockable at lv 18. \n\nI guess that the tl;dr of my opinion here is that the fog of war is not only good but necessary for healthy gameplay, and too much of a buff to trinkets could potentially remove that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Partholonian","date":"2015-02-19T03:55:13.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, there has to be *limits* to vision.

The meta exists for a reason . . . it is the result of the tactical reasoning of the top players.  It is not a mechanic to blindly follow especially when what applies to the top tier does not necessarily apply elsewhere.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2015-02-17T23:19:23.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"False: The best item in the game is {{item:3175}}","replies":[{"poster":"ULTRAF0RCE","date":"2015-02-17T23:23:00.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not an item anymore {{item:3070}} {{champion:107}}","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2015-02-17T23:26:15.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3070}} {{champion:107}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Partholonian","date":"2015-02-18T03:33:55.359+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, the first one was correct.

I checked the gold efficiency of sightstone to ruby sightstone, sure, ruby is less efficient, but you still have 200 more health, so if im going with a  sightstone, might as well go for the ruby while at it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Drogeist","date":"2015-02-18T00:43:26.620+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I tend to stick with the idea that just about any support should still get a sight stone, I do completely agree that the stealth ward upgrade is AMAZING for many champions.  Seems like I always have a ward up when I need one.  Put one in the enemy jungle and get an opportunistic kill.  Ward all approaches to your solo lane and reduce the chances of being ganked.  \n\nIt's cheap, it's useful, and you get wards without having to use an item slot or even go back to the base to buy them.

Within 2-3 minutes of getting the trinket you can have 3 wards on the map constantly, and you don't have to go back to base to refresh them. I've been doing this on supports if I get fed and want to make damage to further stomp my lane - upgrade trinket for 250 gold instead of paying 800 for Sightstone. It works pretty well, honestly.","replies":[]}]}
