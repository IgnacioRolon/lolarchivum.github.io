The Patcher and everything loads perfect. I can select a champion and load the game, but then my game crashes before the characters load into map. \r\n\r\nMy computer completely freezes on the screen looping the last sound. I am unable to play league OR any other full screen game. CS:GO does not work. I believe that the windows update corrupted something on my computer - Graphics Card etc. but i have no clue how to fix it\r\n\r\nThese are the things I have tried to fix:\r\nRevert to older build of Windows 10 - Failed\r\nRepair LoL files - Failed\r\nDelete LoL and reinstall - Failed\r\nUpdate drivers - Failed - Up to Date\r\n\r\nI will retry any suggestions, supply any logs, or try any method to fix this. \r\n\r\nThank you for the help!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-28T21:39:01.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This may be due to an issue with a recent Windows 10 update that auto-enabled the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html).
