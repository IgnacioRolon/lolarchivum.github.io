When I started the download, the launcher downloaded normally - at normal speeds and in a matter of minutes. However, once I got into the actual game and started downloading the whole game, I've been having problems. Its been over an hour now, and the download is barely proceeding. The downloaded started at 1.3 MB/s, and quickly decreased to 335 KB/s. Over the hour, it has eventually decreased to 205 KB/s. My internet  speed test shows a range of 40-55 Mb/s, so I should have more than 200 KB/s. Aside from this, while it is showing that I have a current download speed - it is not 0 kb/s - the remaining download is not decreasing and also increase. For example, it is at 9194.2 MB, then goes down to 9194.0 MB, then goes back up to 9194.3 MB, as if more files are being added to the download. \r\nDoes anyone have any tips to help get a regular download speed back, as well as to stop it from what seems like adding files to the download queue?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-01T01:39:53.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There might be something either within your network or along the route to our servers that's giving your connection a hard time reaching our servers.
