Don't rush {{item:3174}} it sucks as an item in general. I suggest {{item:3165}} as a first item, into either Deathcap or Zhonya's. Max Q, then W. Never factcheck brushes, as your Q is a temporary ward wherever it is placed. Also, instead of ignite, like thirsty Ori players go, use a defensive summoner spell. Use her long range to your advantage, move your ball while also repositioning yourself so you don't die. Always attach your ball to the tank when going in, and ult once your tank is in the midst of the enemy team.","replies":[{"poster":"Paper Towel","date":"2015-02-25T05:25:17.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any suggestions for runes and masteries?\nI currently run 21/0/9, with hyprid pen reds, armor yellows, mr blues, and ms quints.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Raptorspls","date":"2015-02-27T18:23:09.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"9x scaling CDR blues for runes is needed.\nBuild tear even when behind.\nGet scaling hp yellows if you can lane well early on.\nGet flat hp yellow if you can't lane well early.\nbuild CDR boots.\nget 5% CDR on masteries from offensive tree.\nPicked up this style from Faker.

Against mages like Ahri and Veigar, grail is a must buy. Morellos is a situational item but it works very well and I really like it.\n\nFor boots I would say {{item:3020}}  but {{item:3158}} is a great buy as well because the CDR is great for Ori.\n\nLiandrys is a terrible item on Ori, if you want a health item that has AP, go for rylais, more ap and the slow combined with your ult is great if you panic ult and your W is on CD.\n\nMy build is usually {{item:3040}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3135}}  but you can swap some items out for {{item:3174}} if you really need to, {{item:3001}} if you're getting dived on{{item:3100}} if you really want that AA aspect of Ori, but I'd say using {{item:3165}} is also a good choice, maybe even better than Grail. That's my standard build, varying against different team comps.\n\n\nMax Q first, then W. In laning phase, use Q-W in quick succession for lots of good poke and throw in some AAs if you can. When going for combos, Ult-W in that order, if it hasn't killed the enemy already, the slow will ensure your team can get them as well as your W gives your allies a speed boost.\n\nI run mpen Reds, but your hybrid pens are even better, armor yellows, mr glyphs and ap quints as my more offensive page, if I want to play an aggressive style. Of I'm going for a safer playstyle, I will go mpen Reds, health yellows, ap glyphs and ap quints which seems really weird, I know, but your E grants passive defense boots while the ball is on you, and if you're playing safe, that's most of the time (lol this logic). That's just me though. \n\nReally gotta pay attention to the position of the ball, using E on yourself might end up making you ult yourself and hitting nothing, which, btw, has happened to me a lot of times before. QE for quick poke and return.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-02-25T04:54:04.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not going to go into builds because I feel yours is very improper but because there are literally a couple thousand good Ori guides you can find on solomid.net for builds.

Go look at the featured builds for Ori. I say this because I am not dealing with another \"Liandry's is good on champ X but not built by ANY notable player because they are lost.\" Item builds are determined for very specific reasons, while there are variables in them (example building athene's into full AD team would be dumb) that does NOT mean, \"I am B5 and it works in my elo\"...because if it did you would not be bronze 5.
