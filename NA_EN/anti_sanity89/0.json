The issue may be able to be resolved by clearing the file on the server, but if this is done, you'll have to recreate all of your item sets from scratch. There's no guarantee this will work, but if you'd like to try this, I suggest working through the steps below:\n\n>First, **log into the game** then navigate to your installation folder, which should be in the following directory:\n\n>**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends**\n\n>Delete the folder named **CONFIG**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, close League out and relaunch/relog back in. Create a test item set, then hop into a custom match to see if it shows up in-game. Let me know if this worked.","replies":[{"poster":"Anti Sanity89","date":"2016-09-17T15:50:16.737+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did what you said and while i didn't get my original set back i did get back a new page i was working on\nit does show in game and i can live with that thank you for being more helpful than a support ticket il remember to come to the forums first next time.","replies":[]}]}]}
