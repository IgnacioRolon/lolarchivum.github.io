Anyways I just want the Riot design team to take notice on blight varus and change his w and r particles I mean you changed it in arlight but why get lazy and not do the same to blight. I guess I understand the reasoning since it kind of matches the skin but still new particles would be better. {{champion:110}}","replies":[{"poster":"ImAMountainGoat","date":"2015-03-16T08:17:18.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please! I was just coming here to post something about this. I like Blight Crystal Varus the best out of all the skins (just my personal opinion like everyone else) but the particle effects just aren't there so it's not actually worth buying myself. Especially not at it's current pricing. \n\nThe idea that the W passive could actually be blighted crystals ~~(~~as was mentioned in a [previous post](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3627795) ~~) ~~sounds amazing. And then to just make his Chain of Corruption match, have small crystal particles shoot out and then combine together into bigger, more constricting crystals. Who knows? The possibilities are endless and I would love to see this skin updated :)\n\nAlthough I'm sure it'll just go on Riot's LLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNG to do list xD","replies":[]}]}
