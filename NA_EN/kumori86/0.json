I have played league of legends consistently for the past for 4 years. This is the most toxic and stupid this game has ever been. I cant win a game without a friend in solo/duo because everyone else plays brain dead. The game in itself is a simple strategy game. But the human factor is driving me nuts!! How hard is it to get along with 4 other people on your team for 30min?! How hard is it to not be toxic, not rage when you die once, or not afk because someone asked you to stop running into an enemy and die?! \r\n\r\nGame mechanics, map awareness, and general common sense are gone in the elo in silver... How do people even make it to LCS with these narcissistic, passive aggressive, trolls?! Muting helps with not reading toxic mess through out the game but it doesn&#039;t stop them from chasing kills, running around and afk farming when they are jungle, and in general making the game you&#039;re in terrible. I know others who play this game feel this way. All i want is to be able to climb with my skills. Not be driven mad by this stuff. And I&#039;m tired of people making excuses for these people. &quot;Well that&#039;s how it is&quot;, &quot;just focus on you&quot;, &quot;you cant talk about them because etc.&quot; Why do we as a gaming community have to suffer through these types of things? \r\n\r\nI hope Riot fixes some things next season, because people should be winning because they are good, not because the other team has a flamer or that one person who refuses to take any type of critique on their play. And I mean &quot;hey man you&#039;re running into the enemy and dying. farm up a bit until jungle comes to help you.&quot; *proceeds to curse you out and feed*. &quot;Hey lets try not to tunnel vision on kills and push the lanes out.&quot; *Goes and chases a high damage target with no wards into their jungle and gets 4 man jumped.* \r\n\r\nI knew the climb would be hard but not almost impossible.","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-09-10T03:51:21.532+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can control yourself, but you cannot control others.\n\nThere isn't anything you can do about flamers, Riot can only ban them, \n\n\n>How do people even make it to LCS with these narcissistic, passive aggressive, trolls?! \n\nThey solo carry!, they are simply too good for the Elo that they don't belong in, its like those \"challenger vs 5 bronze\" videos, even if 5 people deals more damage, the one will always have map awareness and alot of awareness around them.\n\nyeah its annoying, but what do you suppose to fix it?\n\nmute all, or just the toxic person.\n\nI usually just /mute all in ranked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-09-10T14:31:09.804+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kumori86,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=4h4EEyEY,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-09-10T00:55:36.249+0000)\n> \n>  How do people even make it to LCS with these narcissistic, passive aggressive, trolls?! \n\nThey farm up well,  play around cool down and power spikes, pick people off around vision, 1v3 them through better mechanics and ability to press their champion to the limits, pressure through better wave manipulation. \n\nThere's probably more to it, but that's the extent I know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"R107 Games","date":"2018-09-10T01:06:40.310+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kumori86,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=4h4EEyEY,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-09-10T00:55:36.249+0000)\n>\n>  winning because they are good, not because the other team has a flamer.\n\nWhat does a flamer have to do with winning/losing games?","replies":[{"poster":"Kumori86","date":"2018-09-10T02:03:22.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=R107 Games,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=4h4EEyEY,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-09-10T01:06:40.310+0000)\n>\n> What does a flamer have to do with winning/losing games?\n\nUsually when someone is flaming they are sitting there typing instead of playing. Case in point my last game the Kat starts calling me worthless because i would go into 4v2s.
