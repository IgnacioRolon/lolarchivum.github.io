While the shield is active, Urgot gains **armor reducing attacks**.\n\nWhile the shield is active, Urgot's attacks & missiles **reduce (*possibly \"steals\", instead?*) the target's armor by 12/14/16/18/20%** (*same as current/live values, unless you guys intend to change it?*).\n\n* [E] - Noxian Corrosive Charge:  Urgot launches a corrosive charge that damages enemies in an area and **slows targets**.\n\nEnemies afflicted by the charge have their **Movement Speed reduced (*possibly \"stolen\" as well?*) by 20/25/30/35/40%** (*same as current/live values, unless you guys intend to change it?*).  Urgot's basic attacks & missiles also **slow** the target **while they're afflicted**.\n\n-----\n\nMy reasoning for this switch is basically the same reasoning as with Rework {{champion:72}}'s Movement Slow shift to his E-Fracture, and Rework {{champion:79}}' Movement Slow shift to his Q-Barrel Roll (which I also posted about, a *long* time ago:  [Gragas - Switch Enemy Speed Debuffs](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2572371)  .)\n\n* Thematic cohesiveness/intuitive logic\n\n* Using a spell that activates a shield (*W-Terror Capacitor*), **just** to be able to use its Movement Slow function, just isn't intuitive in terms of gameplay.  And swapping these functions in his kit would certainly make his gameplay become more intuitive & improve his learning curve.\n\n* Also, using a spell that looks very chromatically similar to {{champion:29}}'s W-Venom Cask (*E-Noxian Corrosive Charge*), but *doesn't* **slow**, is just plain *confusing* (*especially for players who like to play both champions - {{champion:6}} {{champion:29}} - and are trained to think that the abilities are consistent with each other*).\n-----\n\nAdditional Fixes:\n\n* Allow Urgot to move while casting Q & E. \n(**QoL Fix**, *for more intuitive gameplay; helps with learning curve/improving gameplay skills.  I don't remember if he can, or can't, as I haven't yet..'retested' him this week & it's been forever since I've played him, but it doesn't look like he can from his videos*.)\n\n* [R] - Hyper-Kinetic Position Reverser:  Both Urgot & the suppressed target are untargetable until the reversal channel is completed.\n**Reasoning**:\nThis helps solidify the..\"fantasy\" (*original intention/design/vision?*)..of the ult, so that it doesn't simply turn into a glorified Root/Stun, allowing both teams to kill the champions being reversed, while the reversal is still in progress.\nInstead, it forces both teams to wait for the reversal's channel to end, & decide whether to engage a teamfight, peel for/protect their displaced teammate, somehow manage both, or disengage & leave their teammate to die.  (*\"Counterplay\"?*)\n\n-----\n\n(*Trying to think of what else to say, to further flesh-out my ideas, but that's all I've got.  I think I've said it all?*)\n\nAnyways, I hope you guys consider implementing these fixes for Urgot!  =D\nHe's a fun champ that I want to unlock & play more often (*especially with his Battlecast skin!*  =D ), but the current state of his kit has kept me from playing him to the best of my abilities, and my proposed changes would certainly allow me (*& possibly others*) to play him better.\n\n(*I also have some ideas for his larger rework, but I'll save them for when the official thread for that appears*.)\n\nThank you for your time & for reading this!  =D\n\n[Will be posting this here & in the other thread you've posted in, since I don't know which one is the official Urgot Rework discussion thread - the original thread was in the old forum & it's been archived.]","replies":[]},{"poster":"LoL Ergo Urgot","date":"2015-02-26T02:29:12.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You sir.
