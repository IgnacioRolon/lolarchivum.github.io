Keep in mind that a 4-man pre-made is not a full 5-man premade and that the other lone player might not appreciate the kind of jokes you and your friends like to do. Many people have been punished and claimed \"just joking with friends\" when in fact it wasn't just them and their friends in the game. Either use a program like skype or discord to chat in, do it in a full 5-man premade or don't do it at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2017-09-02T17:52:27.178+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sure you can.  Just like when you are in a restaurant, a movie theater, any public places, you have to mind other people around you.  When you are in a restaurant with 3 of your friend and there's one random guy eating at the next table, if you start throwing vulgarities at your friends jokingly, you are still going to be asked to leave because the restaurant owner has to respect all his patrons and you are disturbing the other guy.\n\nIn this game, you can't exactly ask the 5th guy to mute the 4 of you and basically forced him to play the game in complete silence.  He has the option to mute you all if he wanted to, but the choice should not be forced on him.  If you are to throw toxic jokes with your friends (just like any private venues, e.g. Rito Games, in real life) and someone has to read them, you will probably be reported and 100% deserved the ban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Winek Chan","date":"2017-09-06T21:14:58.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, no matter how hostile this was said, I understand :/\n\nI understand the 5th guy can be uncomfortable, but what I can't get is why would that make you someone toxic? It's not like I would have the intention of it, and  I was more questioning the example that the 5th guy thought we were flaming eachother for real and reported us because he thought we were actually toxic. Normally, if some guy feels uncomfortable about flaming n everything, he would say something like \"Stop flaming please\" which we would proceed by saying it's a joke only between each others and of course don't do it seriously against other people.","replies":[{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2017-09-06T21:25:45.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The point is that it doesnt matter if you tell him it's just a joke.  He did not queue up to see flame and toxicity (jokingly or not).\n\nIf you are with your friends at home, you  can throw all kind of slurs you want.  No one cares.  But when you are out in public, you cannot gain free pass to throw slurs out loud (e.g. people can/gave to clearly read them) just because you said it's a joke.\n\nDo it in private chat or private voice comm.\n\n\n\"Stop flaming please\" is usually the phrase that get the troll/flamer to redirect his trolling at you because the troll can smell that his trolling get to you.  Mute and report is what people should do.  I should not have to decipher if you are joking or not because i should not have to read it to begin with.","replies":[{"poster":"Winek Chan","date":"2017-09-06T22:16:40.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really get your troll example here, but what I mean is that if it's obvious that I'm screwing around with my mate and it makes them uncomfortable, then someone sane would say \"Can you stop flaming\" otherwise they would just be a senseless dick :/\n\nIt's kinda shit but when I'm in a 4 man premade and let it out I usually tell the other we are shitting around and most answers I get is \"np\" and \"lol\".","replies":[{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2017-09-06T23:50:24.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It only takes ONE person to be uncomfortable with your jokes and report you.\n\nIf you want to risk your account, that's on you.\n\nIf you play with me and \"joke\" offensively, I will quietly report you without telling you...just like i would with any toxic chat in my games.  I feel no obligation to inform the person im reporting.\n\nAnd yes, it's a punishable offense because automatic chat scan....\n\nI am simply trying to tell you that if your \"jokes\" are offensive, not everyone will be willing to engage and ask you to stop.  You are creating a negative gaming experience for anyone not part of your premade and you are risking your account if someone report you.
