First, when you initially moved the servers, everything was great.  Got solid 30 ping normally and at worst (on the other server i guess) I would occasionally get 45 ping.   Both completely playable, no problems.  After a month or so, that 30 ping vanished and now 43 is the absolute best I can get.  Whatever still good.\n\nHowever this past week, I've had a solid 80-90 ping.  No amount of PC resets, modem resets, or router resets change this.  Literally _nothing_ has changed on my end.  Not even a PC software update.  Before this, I had a somewhat steady ping of 43-50ish for months.\n\nWoW servers in Chicago = solid 32 ping.  Rarely, if ever, fluctuates.\nOverwatch servers = solid 32 ping. Rarely, if ever fluctuates. I'm aware that it's not officially Chicago but Blizzard owns servers in Chicago and it's a central location so it's possible.\nLoL in Chicago = 43-80ish ping.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pizzanator99","date":"2017-02-14T00:32:07.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well at least on my end I know it's my ISP, everyone in my area is having trouble with them it seems.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Trevarg","date":"2017-02-07T02:51:47.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anyone Experience a large steady ping increase?
