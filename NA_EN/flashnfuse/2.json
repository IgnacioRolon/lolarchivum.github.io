Maybe a tad higher to compensate for the lack or reliability, but not much.\nIt's not guaranteed hit... but it's pretty much fool-proof anyway. The size of Randuin, around an Akali or Diana diving in your team? You won't avoid it.\n\nWhich leaves... it's AoE. Yeah, that's kinda a noticeable difference, if you can hit 4 or 5 enemies, that's a lot more damage than Electrocute, but damage on the frontline will probably not really matter in the end. It's a bit light, as the only point to justify its existence. (Also, Electrocute is technically AoE, but the radius is really tiny, so I won't nitpick about that.)\n\nDH and Electrocute, on the other hand, have a **very** meaningful difference: one is strong in early game, the other is a late-game scaling choice. There are clear situations where you want one over the other. Can you give me a similar clear situation where sometimes Electrocute is the right choice, and sometimes it's Supernova?","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2018-05-31T19:21:08.799+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"- If you know you want loaded damage aginst key target, Ele, If you'll roam bot a lot and want to spread your damage to both targets, Nova\n- If you want more flexibility being sure you can shut down the target with extra damage even when you already used combo, sacrificing the measure of the damage\n- When you want to just zone off enemy, yet again, sacirifcing damage\netc.\n\nAs If other keystones had much more diversity than this, lol. Aery is extra damage on first spellcasts just like Comet, except Comet is chosen when you poke with any CC, Aery is chosen when you don't or when you have enchant.\n\nWhen choosing between Aftershock, Guardian and Grasp, you either dive with CC, are Support or are Bruiser, even less decision-making and these keystones are vastly different.\n\nWhen choosing between Press the Attack and Elec you either run away after combo or you keep fighting. There are divers who pick PTA as three hits into burst, when they fight afterwards, then Skirmishers who pick Elec for three hits into burst then run away.\n\nLiterally If Elec showed the amount of stacks with the same graphic effect as PTA, suddenly the runes would be nearly identical. With PTA you trade away the reliability for dmg amp and smaller CD.\n\n> (Also, Electrocute is technically AoE, but the radius is really tiny, so I won't nitpick about that.)\n\nJust because it looks like that to you? Or do you have any way to prove it? Because you can get to PT, put two dummies extremly close and you'll see it deals damage only to specific one.

All 3 of them have a 3-attack proc model, but vastly different effects, which are useful in completely different situations.\nPtA is a supportive, team-wide keystone with back-loaded damage, good in large team-fights late game with no CD, whereas Electrocute is a very selfish, early game keystone with front-loaded damage, single target (or tiny AoE) and a big CD which prevents you to proc it on multiple targets. Except the way they proc, they have nothing in common.\nOn the other hand, what's the good situation to use Supernova? It's not large team-fights, even though it's AoE. Who are its intended users? Champs who want to dive in and burst a priority target. Those champ will pick Supernova and use it exactly as they use Electrocute, or so close that the difference won't be noticeable, I wager.\nAlso, PtA is in Precision, so gives AS, whereas Electrocute is in Domination and gives AD. Supernova would be in Sorcery, so gives AD just as Electrocute.\n\n> There is no reason for it to be AoE, that would be such unnecesary decision.\n\nI'm not sure about the new version since Rune Reforged, but the old version (Thunderlord's Decree in the previous Rune system) was 100% AoE, but with a radius of something like 25 units. The whole area was half a teemo wide, so basically the only way for it to affect multiple targets was if the second was dashing through your primary target at the moment you proc it. Very unlikely to happen in a real situation, that's why I said I wouldn't nitpick, but it was technically AoE.\nNot sure about the new version, but I simply assumed they didn't change that aspect.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"HonestJohnTheCon","date":"2018-05-30T18:43:55.774+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"More sorcery keystones are always nice, and this one looks like it could have some potential.","replies":[{"poster":"Zone of Endless","date":"2018-05-31T01:07:27.296+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Helixarrow,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0IBEUVaq,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-05-30T18:43:55.774+0000)\n>\n> More sorcery keystones are always nice, and this one looks like it could have some potential.\n\nthey'll just throw this into domination and give sorcery another speed rune","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-05-31T06:43:45.262+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Truth is becoming more ironic than fiction nowadays...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"flibitydoo","date":"2018-05-30T17:41:08.717+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like a mixture of electrocute and aftershock.\n\nhard to tell if any of these assassins would use it over electrocute given that 3 seconds is a lot of time to stay near an enemy champion and if they are covered by their teammates they might die.\n\nI know for a fact that most elise players will immediately rappel after combo'ing so she's probably out of there before the supernova can go off.\n\nAlso I just feel like everyone else would rather run electrocute anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2018-05-30T21:36:46.430+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Electrocute is single target, this is AoE.\n\nWhat about adding in that large/epic monsters can trigger this as well?

That could be fixed by making it champion only though.\n\nThe second one is that it prompts you to not want to poke your opponent because you lose out on all in potential.  Electrocute for example requires 3 damage instances, meaning that you can poke without losing your burst.  Meteor on the other hand comes up more the more you do poke, and is meant as a poke one in the first place.\n\nI also just generally feel like it is a more niche version of Electrocute.  The champions you mentioned generally want to take out a single target as quickly as possible, Akali for her R reset, Diana because she is focused on trying to burst someone down in a very short amount of time.  None of them have much use for doing damage in a large AOE at the cost of single target burst, and post laning phase if their kill time takes 3 seconds then they are already going to be dead anyways or their damage is so low that this keystone wont make up for their lack of burst.\n\nWhat I do see happening is J4 and other similar divers focused on AOE taking this, although most of them can just take aftershock for less damage in a smaller area, but with the resistances to actually live long enough to kill their opponents.  Of the people you listed I could see Elise taking it _purely_ because her mid-late game teamfight is a bit weak and it helps her provide some more damage for the team, and even then she would only be able to take it because spider form E lets her survive that long in a fight.","replies":[{"poster":"FlashnFuse","date":"2018-05-31T14:55:58.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is AOE around yourself and can be triggered by a single spell for weaker than comet power, or triggered by all your spells for a stronger than electrocute all in with teamfight utility that electrocute and comet lack.\n\nThe big selling point is this rune is made for somebody who wants to dive into a team and doesn't mind a little setup. Diana is a great user of this because she wants to land her Q before diving in of her own volition. Nidalee would be a great user too.\n\nWhile this has some overlap with both aftershock and electrocute, being able to go sorcery domination would be a lot better for some Champs than resolve domination, purely for the stat boosts.
