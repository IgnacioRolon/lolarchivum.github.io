[long post]","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hello everyone, I&#039;m FlashnFuse and I&#039;m a [self-proclaimed Quinn main.](http://imgur.com/dMDC6Jd) \nI play Quinn a lot, and I like to think that I&#039;m [pretty](http://i.imgur.com/TAk03cU.png) [good](http://i.imgur.com/DPS4fk9.jpg) with her. I typically play her as a bot lane ADC, but I take her top a lot, and I&#039;ve jungled with her a few times as well.\n\nOver time I&#039;ve had a lot of ideas for buffing her, but overall I think she is in a decent (slightly weaker than competitive) spot right now. [She can hard carry a game if she gets very far ahead](https://youtu.be/FKvVSkAhFDk?t=25m29s), but can easily fall off in the late game. \n\nIn the interest of full disclosure: I haven&#039;t had any of my mains significantly changed or worked on in the time that I&#039;ve played league, so I&#039;m really worried that they&#039;ll change Quinn into a champion that I do not like. Rather than complaining about the changes or crying, I would like to make a comprehensive list of ideas so that RiotRepertoir and his team have some discussion to work off of\n\n**Please note that it would be absolutely insane to make all the changes I&#039;m suggesting, this is just a list of ideas that I have in a notepad file that I want to share with the boards. If they went through with every silly buff idea I had, Quinn would be more ridiculous than Warwick with release skirmishers/devourer. Some ideas are better than others, most are buffs, some are changes i&#039;ve seen other people suggest that I liked, some are changes I&#039;ve seen other people suggest that I disliked, and some things are a desperate attempt at comedy. This is just a giant blob of everything I feel I can contribute to my favorite champion and should be taken with a grain of salt due to my confessed bias.**\n\nLet&#039;s start out with the simple things! What is fundamental to Quinn&#039;s identity? Though it may vary from person to person, I think that Quinn mains can agree on three things:\n1. Valor tells the best knock knock jokes\n2. The harrier proc mini-game is fun and occasionally maddening, but it makes Quinn who she is\n3. Correct use of Vault can make you great, poor use of Vault is the easiest way to get yourself killed\n\nLet&#039;s address each skill in no particular order:\n\n(E) Vault: _Dash to targeted enemy and bounce away from them, dealing a small amount of damage while knocking them up and slowing them for a short duration. Applies a mark of harrier to the effected target_\n\nThis skill is perfect as it is, it doesn&#039;t need to get changed. I&#039;ve seen a few different discussion for changing this skill and the most common one I see is \"change it to be a dash like Graves&#039; quick draw or Vayne&#039;s tumble\". I would be incredibly disappointed to see that change. Vault&#039;s greatest strength comes from being a targeted skill, even changing it to something more along the line of Vi&#039;s vault breaker would be a bad change because of enemy champions/minions accidentally bodyblocking your single gapcloser/disengage skill. Did you know that Vault follows someone exactly the same way that Lee Sin&#039;s resonating strike does? I&#039;ve gotten killed a few times because of that, but I&#039;ve caught and killed far more enemies with that then I&#039;ve lost. On top of that, this skill is great for a disengaging as well. It interrupts channels (fiddle drain, katarina ult, etc) and is a nicely rounded off skill.\n\n**TL;DR people that main Quinn don&#039;t want vault to be changed**\n\n(Passive) Harrier: _Valor periodically marks a visible target as vulnerable, granting sight of the affected target. Quinn does a moderate amount of damage when attacking a vulnerable target. Passive disappears when Quin is replaced by Valor_ \n\nThe \"shoot the harrier procced targets\" is a fun minigame. Valor can be a bit of a troll at times and mark someone you don&#039;t want marked. That&#039;s okay though, he&#039;s not malicious; he&#039;s just a bird and birds are dumb. What I love about this skill is it does a great job of translating the thematic elements of a person and a bird working together to hunt down targets.\nThere are a few small buffs you can throw at the skill, but really this one is in a good spot right now\n1.  Harrier does bonus damage to minions (similar to caitlynn&#039;s headshot). It would make the early laning phase a bit better and is just a \"feel-good\" buff to the skill.\n2. Harrier passive and Vault mark use separate cooldowns. Vault applies a mark of your passive (which is great!) but it also resets your passive timer (which is not so great). This means that if your harrier has 2 seconds until it marks someone and you use vault, you will apply harrier to a target and reset the passive cooldown (~8ish seconds). This is kind of annoying, but a very reasonable limitation of the skill. This would be a big buff to Quinn&#039;s damage and make a lower skill floor for vault/harrier resets.\n3. Have auto attacks consume the harrier mark similar to a Katarina Q. I&#039;ve seen this suggestion before, but I think that this would be a very bad change. As the skill is now, you have to **start** an auto attack **after** the mark is applied to get the harrier damage. Clarity wise, it&#039;s great to know that you need to run away from the crazy bird lady when you have a target on your back. If they changed it so that it got consumed when an auto attack hits, regardless of when the mark was applied(so lets say .1 second before the auto attack hit), it would lose clarity and be an insanely unfair damage boost that your opponent couldn&#039;t see coming. \n4. Ignore bonus armor (similar to caitlynn headshot). Strictly a dirty buff that would help her out at all stages of the game, particularly late game when she struggles.\n5. Make critical strike chance lower harrier&#039;s cooldown. This would be a similar change to Ashe in how this champion uses critical strike chance differently, but this would also force Quinn into a standard adc build. I think there are some good trade offs that can be made here though, so I would be curious how riot would implement this system.\n6. Movement speed boost (equal to W&#039;s passive speed boost) when moving towards a Harrier-marked target. Being a very short ranged attacker, Quinn can get in a lot of trouble trying to hit a harrier marked target. This would be a gigantic fat buff\n7. Auto attacks reduce harrier cooldown. This is a change I would love to see, especially if they went for the \"remove critical hits\" route on Quinn. Quinn doesn&#039;t scale incredibly well with raw attack speed (since all her damage is in harrier&#039;s semi-static cooldown or her ultimate&#039;s execute) but this would complement that botrk and youmuu&#039;s that people like to build on her. I think could be over bearing though, allowing Quinn to have too much burst and sustained damage.\n8. Harrier gives true sight on the target. It&#039;s kind of annoying when Valor marks someone and they go invisible, or when you vault off someone and they go invisible. With this change you can mark someone with true sight and then choose to not attack them (to give your team the vision on them) or you can attack them, consume the mark, and lose vision on them. This could be an interesting change but I&#039;m worried about how hard this would hit stealth-based champions.\n9. Harrier procs reduce vault&#039;s cooldown by 1 second. Could be a sweet buff for when you&#039;re dueling someone for an extended period of time. Not to overbearing.\n10. **BUG FIX** When you auto attack someone marked by harrier but behind a windwall or Braum&#039;s shield, the harrier mark remains on the target but you can no longer consume the mark. Reaaaaaallllly annoying bug that needs to be looked at and fixed.\n\n**TL;DR this skill is in an okay place right now, but I have a few small tweaks it could take along with a significant bug fix**\n\n(W)Heightened Senses: _Active: Reveal an area around Quinn. Passive: Gives a small movement and attack speed boost when you proc harrier. Gives a large amount of attack speed as Valor._\n\nThis is a nice scouting skill with a long cooldown. Straight out of the gate I would like to suggest a buff that would give it parity with other scouting tools:\n1. **Two charges** . Similar to Ashe&#039;s scouting tool and Kalista&#039;s scouting tool. This would give Quinn&#039;s scouting tool parity with other markswomen. I can see no good counter argument for Quinn not getting 2 charges on this skill when other adcs have 2 charges on their longer range scouting skills. Really feels like a no-brainer to me.\n2. More attack speed. If you go down the path of making harrier \"scale\" off attack speed, i think it would be cool to bump up the attack speed passive from this skill. I think could be over bearing though, allowing Quinn to have too much burst and sustained damage.\n3. More movement speed. Could be a neat numbers buff, but we shouldn&#039;t make our adcs too mobile.\n4. Passive as Valor attack speed moved to ultimate. As it is right now, this skill gives a massive boost to attack speed as valor (40% + 10% per rank in W). I&#039;m not a fan of the attack speed on Valor being gated behind a skill that is a 1 point wonder at best (there is no realistic reason to max this skill over Q or E in any game I&#039;ve ever played). I think moving the attack speed boost as Valor to ranks in the ultimate would be a nice significant buff. But I have a lot of different changes under the ultimate section.\n5. Proccing Harrier removes slows. Makes sense that a movement speed boost can break a slow. Could be op.\n6. Ranks in W **increase your attack range against harrier marked targets** . This could give this skill the meaningful choices when it comes to \"which skill should i max first?\". This will still probably be the last skill you mark up, but it would be a very uniquely new mechanic for the game and reinforce the thematic ranger and bird hunting down targets and attacking \"from above\".\n\n**TL;DR two charges is mandatory for scouting skills, move attack speed from this skill to ultimate, this skill gives attack range on marked targets**\n\n(Q) Blinding Assault: _Throws valor in a line in front of you, damaging enemies he hits for a decent amount of damage. Also blinds enemies he hits by gouging out their eyes, which is fucking savage_\n\nThe blind is what makes Quinn able to fight marksmen with better kits/more damage than herself. A good hit of blind can make or break a fight for you, and is great against anyone heavily auto attack reliant (Vayne, Jinx, Master Yi/any devourer user). While being not so great against ADCs that rely on spells for damage (Ezreal, Graves, Varus,etc ). I love the thematic of a blind, since it works great with the whole bird thing but visually there is little difference between throwing valor in a straight line and throwing a knife (or something) in a straight line. My following changes are mostly just thematic/visual changes to the skill, but functionally i believe Q should always remain a blind for Quinn&#039;s enemies.\n1. As Quinn, Q becomes a point click single target blind. I&#039;m not a fan of this change, but it would cement Quinn into a single target duelist while Valor has a lot of AOE. It would make Quinn&#039;s waveclear weaker but her harass stronger.\n2. Q grants vision. There are a lot of skills that you can throw out somewhere and grant vision, I believe that Valor should grant vision in a similar fashion while he&#039;s flying to a spot.\n3. Have blind scale with rank, again for the meaningful choice: \"Do i want to max Q for a longer blind, Vault for faster cooldowns/more mobility, or W for range?\"\n4. Valor lands in a spot in a fashion similar to Elise&#039;s volatile spiderling and Soraka&#039;s starcall. Anyone in the area that Valor lands gets hit with a longer blind, the damage and is marked by harrier. If there is nobody at the landing spot, Valor chases a nearby target and hits them for less damage and less blind time with no harrier mark . This skill would just be amazing fun to get a clump of enemies (minions mostly) marked with harrier and could be interesting way of showing the Demacian Duo working as a team to kill things. This could be seen as a net nerf if Valor&#039;s acquisition range is too low, or if the \"starcall\" style landing is too long, but it could be a far trade off for the longer blind and harrier marks on the center of mass. Valor should probably prioritize whoever Quinn is auto attacking for the \"chase\" target.\n\n**TL;DR Blind works well thematically for Quinn. Option 4 is the coolest functional change**\n\n(R) Tag Team/Skystrike: _Valor replaces Quinn on the battlefield as a melee attacker and gains attack speed from w. Valor moves through units and gains movement speed while out of combat. Reactivating the ultimate casts skystrike dealing a damage that increases based on opponents&#039; missing health_\n\nI love and hate this skill. If you see one person outside of the pack, you can catch and kill them pretty easily (which is where Quinn gets her assassin title from). That being said,  It&#039;s absolutely useless in an organized team fight against competent opponents. Becoming melee ranged isn&#039;t fun when you&#039;re a squishy ad carry, and the execute damage isn&#039;t even that great compared to other executes.  The AOE on it is also very small, unless you&#039;re sitting in the middle of their team (don&#039;t do that). If you don&#039;t completely change this skill (which you should, and I have a suggestion below) I have some changes you could make to it.\n1. The cooldown is way too long. (140 / 110 / 80) is its base cooldown. Compare that to Jinx&#039;s (90 / 75 / 60) execute that does more damage from a safer distance or Riven&#039;s (110 / 80 / 50) cooldown which does SIGNIFICANTLY more damage and puts Riven right where she wants to be. It&#039;s just not fair compared to these two other AOE executes and should be lowered either by a fixed amount or by 1 second per harrier mark.\n2. Valor gets damage resistance or armor/MR. Strictly to what a melee champ of that level would have. Could be OP or worthless depending on how much resistance valor gets. This is a very poor path to go down, don&#039;t do this.\n3. Valor can still mark enemy targets as vulnerable for harrier&#039;s damage. Quinn&#039;s primary damage source comes from harrier, and it hurts a lot when harrier is gone.\n4. Skystrike marks everyone it hits with a harrier mark. Again, the AOE isn&#039;t great enough that you could do this in a teamfight and hit too many enemy champions, but it would add more kill power to the execute.\n5. R breaks CC when Quinn switches to Valor OR makes Quinn untargettable as they swap. Could be an interesting change, I think of it as Valor swooping in to save Quinn when she gets rooted by morgana or something to that effect. Would add a new interesting choice in using the ult, still I&#039;m not in love with the ult.\n6. R resets cooldowns when Quinn and Valor swap. This is straight up OP. The combo of resetting cooldowns would leave you eternally blinded while letting Quinn and Valor murder you. H-AA means a harrier procced auto attack in this combo (Q -> AA -> H-AA -> E -> H-AA -> R -> E -> AA -> Q -> AA -> AA -> R -> Q -> AA -> H-AA -> E -> H-AA). If that combo doesn&#039;t kill you, it means you&#039;re either truly immortal and/or nasus.\n7. The more time you spend as Valor, the more damage skystrike does. Generally when you ult as Quinn you do a quick burst combo to kill someone, so this change (and the compensatory nerf to the upfront damage) would be horrible.\n8. Skystrikes casts if you die. Could be nice, and definitely reinforces the suicide bomber mentality that Quinn has. This easily tips the line into overpowered territory though. \n9. **A complete overhaul to the skill**. R is now a point and click spell that summons Valor near you and has him race over to attack a targetted enemy. He has the same stats as Quinn (or a bit lower because balance), more attack speed, more movement speed and can move through units. He can no longer use vault, your Q changes so that he does it in an area near him (exactly as it works now, just with a pet) and W&#039;s vision gives vision around him instead of Quinn. Every time Valor auto attacks a target, he marks them with Harrier, which works great with Quinn&#039;s longer range attack if you use the W change proposed above. This is a huge change to the ult, one in that it makes Valor a pet, and two in that it changes to more closely mirror the thematic of Quinn and Valor on the battlefield together. You wouldn&#039;t even have to change the quotes! Naturally this means the execute would be gone, unless you people were insane.\n\n**TL;DR Have the current ultimate replaced with summoning Valor as a pet, Valor auto attacks enemies and marks them with Harrier while the player (as Quinn) attacks in tandem with her bird. No more execute**\n\n\nWow that was long! (MS word clocks this in at just over 3,000 words....) Thanks for reading and I hope that I&#039;ve contributed to the Quinn discussion positively. If anyone has anything to add, I&#039;d love to hear it!","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-13T00:23:07.693+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, just wanted to pop in and say that I read all this and think it's awesome you put so much into it. I agree with a lot of what you've said makes Quinn who she is, and also with a good amount of the what does and does not need to be changed on her. I think playing up her passive to be a bit less frustrating, and even more important and powerful to her could be really cool. I agree that E is a cool trademark ability, and that Tag Team could use some work. This isn't to say any of the other ideas were bad or wrong, but I think they may be easy changes or things that are handled after really nailing down who the character is.\n\nI really appreciate you having written this up. If nothing else, it helps to further align myself with what it is that Quinn players actually want/need out of her. I can't share too many details about any changes I may do for her just yet, but thanks again for the post!","replies":[{"poster":"Recon","date":"2015-08-13T05:47:21.498+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Going to reply here so that hopefully you see this. I'm not entirely familiar with how these forums work unfortunately. Firstly, I implore you not to change Quinn too much. She's unique and fun.\n\n---\n\nAnother self proclaimed Quinn main here. I agree with some of the general thoughts on the skills but disagree with a lot of the potential buffs changes. Will go through them below.\n\nBut before that, one thing I would like regardless of how this (hopefully mini) rework goes is for Valor E to have a separate cooldown to Quinn E so that you can dive into the enemy team and then vault back out to relative safety. Opens up additional play as well. Running away from an enemy and Valor is about to run out? You don't need to bet absolutely everything on the turn around but can potential jump back in, reposition yourself slightly and vault over a nearby wall. For example. Other additional plays are more obvious. One thing to note is that this obviously allows you to proc harrier essentially immediately after using Tag Team, which is obviously a straight up buff to her teamfighting and just generally makes using her ult in a teamfight actually a potentially valid strategy.\n\nAnother thing which would be very much appreciated would be having Blinding Assault's hitbox not originate inside Quinn. Too many kills have been lost because a minion _behind me_ ate the bind I threw forwards. Additionally giving it a conical shape (small missile width at origin, current width at end) would let you essentially arc the skill around minions (a little like Diana Q). Makes sense thematically as well, valor swoops towards the enemy and spreads her wings at the end. Would be important to keep the AoE regardless of distance traveled - change would be to hitbox.\n\n---\n\n:Harrier and Vault:\n\n> Harrier does bonus damage to minions\n\nI don't think this is necessary at all. Farming is already easy on her.\n\n> Harrier and Vault procs have seperate cooldowns\n\nI agree with that them sharing cooldown is a very reasonable limitation to the skill. It makes you have to adjust your playstyle a little bit to actually combo properly. Something which is a) very healthy for the champ, b) gives you a small sense of satisfaction whenever you do it right and c) prevents her from absolutely destroying everyone in a solo lane. Changing this would potentially be too much and require damage nerfs, which is not preferable. \n\n> AAs consuming harrier mark if your AA is in the air as the mark is applied\n\nOn the one hand you're right that it takes away counterplay. On the other it's extremely frustrating when you correctly guess the mark time only for your AA to not proc it. There are a few solutions to this though.\n\n1) Have Harrier be applied by Valor faster (not lower cooldown, just faster marking). This decreases the time between seeing a target being marked and being able to proc the mark.\n\n2) Give a short period of time where the AA will proc a mark that is coming down before it's technically applied to the target. This just reduces the frustration.\n\n> Ignore bonus armor\n\nMany, many Quinn mains (myself included) run a lot of armor pen in their rune pages AND then also build a lot of armor pen. If we're going to 'dirty buff' her I'd prefer it to be somewhere else.\n\n> Crit chance lower harrier CD\n\nThis is a fairly interesting idea. To prevent your feared locking into the ADC build give it a set maximum impact on CD, perhaps I/E alone maxes it out, or perhaps I/E alone maxes it out once your W is rank 5 (crit % to CD reduction ratio change per rank). \n\n> Movement speed boost towards marked targets\n\nAgain I feel like this reduces counterplay, however if is an interesting line of thought. I feel that further increasing the movement speed buff when harrier is proc'd would be a better change that adds a lot of potential skill to the champion. Currently it's good but not great.\n\nFor example;\n1) Harrier annoyingly marks a minion > proc the mark and have an easier time poking the enemy. \n2) Enemy goes all in on you. Harrier marks the enemy and once proc'd you're in a better position to orb walk or run away.\n\nNaturally the movement speed buff in this case cannot be too overbearing. Something equivalent to the bonus given by furor boots could work relatively well (though maybe that would be too much as well - testing required).\n\n> AA reduce harrier CD.\n\nNot sure what to say about this one. Gut feeling is that it would be too much.\n\n> Harrier proc reduces vault CD\n\nThis reverses her entire combo. Currently you want to proc a harrier mark and then vault to get your second. In the usual combo you wont see any reduction whatsoever. This would almost _have_ to be combined with the separate vault mark/harrier mark proc idea from earlier to be at all worthwhile.\n\n> 10. Bug Fix\n\nYes to any bug fixes.\n\n---\n\n:Heightened Senses:\n\n> 2 charges\n\nThe skill needs something more before it's worthwhile. 2 charges is one possible step in the right direction.\n\n> Buffs to attack speed boost and movement speed boost\n\nI already covered the movement speed boost above. As far as i'm concerned the bonus attack speed is already in a good spot.\n\n> Moving Valor buffs to ultimate\n\nPersonally it doesn't matter where the attack speed is. At the moment you generally don't want to be fighting people in Valor form -> generally preferring a quick engage with valor and a quick end to Valor before resuming usual ranged attacking (if they're not already dead from that combo).\n\n> Breaking slow\n\nMarksmans with skills that break slows tend to get those abilities removed (see; lucian) and that's mostly because of how much counterplay is removed when you can cleanse a slow easily. A nasus would now never, ever even have a chance regardless of how well he plays.\n\n> AA range increase against marked targets\n\nFrom a thematic perspective it makes some sense. From a gameplay perspective it would be too powerful. Especially in top and mid lane.\n\n:Blinding Assault:\n\n> Targeted\n\nNo thank you. There's something to be said about having some skillshots on a champion. \n\n> Grants vision\n\nUnnecessary and causes an overlap with your W further making it irrelevant. \n\n> Blind scale with rank.\n\nHer blind is currently always effective. Very happy with the duration at all stages of the game. I don't think it needs a duration buff in any way, shape or form.\n\n> Q chases people when you otherwise miss\n\nAn interesting idea but otherwise once again only serves to remove counterplay from the champ. The enemy _should_ be able to dodge it if they're good enough.\n\n:Tag Team/Skystrike:\n\n> CD reduction\n\nA straight CD reduction would make her far too powerful when roaming and not give her any real disincentive to using it. At the moment you _have_ to hesitate to use your ultimate because of the massively long CD.\n\nNow that said, there should be _some way_ to reward a good Quinn player with a lower cooldown for the ult. I have a few ideas for this, important to note that these would not happen together, one or the other;\n\n1) Flat decrease of X seconds on kill or assist when you've recently used Skystrike.\n\nThis gives you an incentive to use your ult aggressively and all in more often.\n\n2) Similar to teleporting to a tower, reduce the cooldown if you don't attack an enemy champion during Tag Team. \n\nOn the one hand this makes her split pushing even stronger - potentially too strong. On the other it gives you a choice between using your ult to engage on the enemy (longer cooldown, more damage in fight) and using it to roam to another lane before coming in as Quinn (shorter cooldown, less damage in fight).\n\n3) Reduced cooldown of Tag Team each time a skill hits an enemy champion while playing as Valor. This serves to give staying in Valor form more value and gives you a shorter cooldown if you're using it to fight rather than just roam and/or splitpush (and run). For example - R>E>Q would reduce your Tag Team cooldown by X seconds x2. Realistically giving you potentially 5~ X second reductions in a standard 1v1/1v2 fight.\n\n4) Go in the opposite direction and instead make her ult last longer if you kill an enemy. Sort of like Yi's ult resetting on a kill. Same strengths, same issues.\n\n> Damage resistance MR/Armor\n\nWont be as effective without also building health, which isn't something I would prefer to be forced to do. Instead I would like to be a little safer when engaging as Valor. Perhaps make her untargettable/invulnerable during her Valor E (like Maokai W).\n\n> Can still mark enemies while Valor\n\nMight make her a bit too strong but would definitely make staying in Valor form more worthwhile. I would settle for being able to proc marks that are already on a champion when you swap.\n\n> Everyone hit by skystrike is marked by harrier\n\nI like the sound of this. Gives you a little bonus if you use Tag Team to show up to a teamfight late (potentially ending Tag Team from a distance where you can hit some enemies with skystrike but dont need to go all in).\n\n> Break CC\n\nMm, not sure about this. Might just kill counterplay a little too much, but it makes sense thematically and it IS her ult so ~ maybe.\n\n> Reset ability cooldowns when you swap.\n\nOnly one I would like and that would give you more healthy play without being broken is Vault and Valor E having separate cooldowns (as I described way earlier).\n\n> More time = more damage\n\nWorks nicely when showing up late. Doesn't give her anything extra for normal teamfights. \n\nBasically, a buff to something which is already a strength of hers rather than smoothing out a weakness. Would be nice, could be overbearing.\n\n> Cast if you die\n\nIn my opinion this should have been the case from day one. You're squishy as hell so if you jump into a teamfight head first you should be able to do so knowing that you will at least be able to achieve X amount of damage because of skystrike.\n\n> Complete Overhaul.\n\nPersonally I like Tag Team. I think it's an extremely unique skill. I think it's fun. I think it's interesting. I think it's core to her kit and I think it makes sense to her thematically. It needs to be tweaked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FlashnFuse","date":"2015-08-13T01:09:18.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Repertoir!

Getting to turn into a bird and being able to zoom around the map is actually one of the core reasons I enjoy playing Quinn.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FlashnFuse","date":"2015-08-17T07:30:06.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've thought about it a bit, and I agree that the ult should stay as is but with some buffs. Quinn's E and Valor's E can be considered two different spells on two independent cooldowns: Quinn has \"Vault\" and Valor has \"Charge\". They remain functionally the same as they are now, just on separate cooldowns (so that when you transform to valor you can charge in immediately). As a counter point just make sure that Quinn's vault remembers its own cooldown, so that you can't Quinn Vault-> R->E->Q->autoattacks->R->E without regards to vault's cooldown. \n\nAlso make it so that skystrike marks everyone with harrier. Harrier's application smoothing out by being \"faster\" would be great (faster animation, not necessarily on a faster cooldown)! \n\nHeightened senses (W) could also have a cool thing where it's buff stacks and refreshes with itself, leading to some crazy plays where you charge into a group of enemies, mark everyone with harrier, and then go to town..... Okay that may be a bit much but it sounds awesome! It would also synergize well with harrier procs lowering the ultimate's cooldown by 1second (or something). \n\nThanks again for reading my giant rito pls post, I hope you see this one too","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2015-08-13T06:06:31.472+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great write-up, but:\n\nAs a Quinn main, her ult is a major part of her appeal to me.

To me, one of the most exciting things about playing Quinn is being able to switch with Valor to 100-0 a squishy target who is out of position. I like that I can play as Valor for a while and I like the hail of arrows at the end as a finisher, it's a very iconic and unique ability and it's what got me into playing Quinn in the first place. Even if they decide to remove Skystrike's damage to buff her elsewhere, keeping the cosmetic effect would be nice.\n\nThat being said, I wouldn't mind some changes to Quinn's kit for some polish. Turning Tag Team into a \"Valor pet\" is probably my least favorite of those ideas as it would remove the fantasy of turning into a speedy and bursty bird that I find the most attractive about playing this Champion.\n\nHere's hoping there are good things to come for our favorite Demacian :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crett","date":"2015-08-13T05:17:03.464+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd probably be ok with Quinn buffs if I did not hate her top laning so so so so so much","replies":[]},{"poster":"OwlWarrior","date":"2015-08-12T23:42:58.496+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"These are all really neat. I'm a big fan of option numero 4 for her Q and option 5 or maybe even 9 for her ult. I agree wholeheartedly with 2 cast for W. It makes sense that Quinn is good at the whole vision game, she has eyes in the sky after all.
