It wasn't a classic lag out, the rest of my computer was running fine (had my playlist running in the background just fine), and I was able to alt tab between the frozen game and other things without it going unresponsive by windows standards. \n\nI left the game, closed the client, reopened and everything was fine.\n\nAny way i could pass some logs to a dev or something to take a look at?","replies":[{"poster":"Fighter Ignite1","date":"2017-09-08T01:11:48.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been having the same problem","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-06T16:26:36.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This seems like packet loss or your network to the game server getting stuck.
