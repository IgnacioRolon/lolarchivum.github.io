If the Acid Hunter, before the Muramana bonus damage is applied, deals enough damage to kill the target, the damage text will only show the pre Muramana damage. Basically, the enemy dies before the rest of the damage can be applied. From what I can see Acid Hunter's otherwise always applying the bonus damage as expected, so there's no gameplay impact (though this does look a little weird visually). Let me know if you're seeing otherwise.","replies":[{"poster":"Steenzs","date":"2015-04-03T11:26:18.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, just tested what you wrote and it happens ,that you're right.\n\nIf Acid Hunter kills the target , the visual trigger of Muramana will occur but you won't see the bonus damage from it. The bonus dmg still triggers on a target which isn't killed by Acid Hunter, however normal attacks always trigger the bonus damage(killing the target or not doesn't matter).\n\nThanks for your help :D\n\nThis thread can be closed.","replies":[]}]}]}
