The loading screen never popped up, and pushing the \"reconnect\" button didn't do anything. \nrito plz help :( \n*edit: I have also tried to spectate multiple different players games from my friends list and my client simply flashed a black screen, then went back to normal (it also showed my status as spectating for a split second when it flashed the black screen as it faded in and out.)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-01T20:49:01.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It definitely sounds like you might be having a network problem reaching the game servers.  This is further affirmed by the black screens, because assets are failing to load.
