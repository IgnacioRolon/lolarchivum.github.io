(Which stands for Rambling At New Things not really thought it was clever though.) Have a frustration about the game? Want to scream your head off about Riot nerfing your main? Want to scream about how broken Yasuo is? Well, the rant board is the place for you! Please remember to read the Rant Board rules however before posting! **We will also be redirecting a lot of spam/ranty posts from Gameplay to Rant now that we have this Board.** https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-moderation/oXu8xQ5v-boards-update-the-rant-board-is-now-live\n\n\nIn case anyone didn't know there is a new Rant board. You're able to create threads there, which probably an optics thing to make it not the thread Graveyard that it actually is, but commenting on threads is not allowed. Just posting my thoughts here so more people can read. Above is the description of it and below my post in the thread announcement thread. I'm posting this all here because I know most of us here don't care about Boards homepage or go to Discuss The Boards much.\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Colonel J,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=oXu8xQ5v,comment-id=0014,timestamp=2019-03-05T13:05:56.014+0000)\n>\n> Whose idea was this?

To quote someone who put it better than I ever could:\n> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=oXu8xQ5v,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2019-03-05T04:29:56.100+0000)\n>\n> Gameplay ~~Plus~~ Minus\n\n","replies":[]}
