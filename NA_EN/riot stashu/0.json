Welcome to another Runes Corner, this time brought to you by Riot Stashu. This week, I&rsquo;m here to preview of a new keystone rune, Hunt of the Blood Moon (temp name)! \n\nI&rsquo;ll get into the details in just a sec, but first, a bit of a primer on the high-level direction for this rune:\n\nHunt of the Blood Moon comes from the path of Domination (also temp name) -- a style geared towards snowballing a lead by hunting down and taking out priority targets with a burst of damage. When designing the suite of three domination keystones, we wanted each one to highlight a different one of these three defining Domination aspects (&lsquo;snowball,&rsquo; &lsquo;hunt,&rsquo; and &lsquo;burst&rsquo;). Hunt of the Blood Moon focuses on the &lsquo;hunt&rsquo; aspect of the style, while its neighbors excel at the other two (stay tuned for more info on those!).\n\nSo without further ado, here is **Hunt of the Blood Moon:**\n_________\n                                              http://i.imgur.com/gG7flg8.png\n\nEnchants your boots with the active effect &#039;Blood Moon&#039;s Call.&#039;\n\nChannel for 3 seconds to activate Blood Moon&#039;s Call. Gain 35% movement speed for 15 seconds. Damaging attacks or abilities end Blood Moon&#039;s Call, dealing 60 - 140 based on level (+0.2 bonus AD)(+0.3 AP) bonus damage. \n\nCooldown: 180 seconds. Starts the game on cooldown and goes on cooldown if damaged or interrupted while channeling.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/bZCoxUA.gifv\n*(Typical W.I.P. note here: numbers are tentative and likely to change before release. Temp icon courtesy of Warwick W.)*\n_________\nSo there you have it: a high cooldown, long duration haste with a touch of damage all neatly packed into whatever boots you&rsquo;re currently wearing (apologies, Cassiopeia). This rune/item combo works a lot like Edge of Night: a cast-while-moving channel that&rsquo;s easily interrupted, so it is best used while out of combat. This mechanism is to solidify it as a &lsquo;hunt&rsquo; rune, instead of an in-combat dodging or burst rune. \n\nYou can cover some SERIOUS ground with this thing active (15s of a 35% haste!), which can be difficult for opponents to account for, so while the hunt is on some sound and visual effects (think Warwick W) will play on enemies within about a screen&rsquo;s range of you. The effect will be on cooldown until 180 seconds into the game, partly to sidestep some potentially degenerate level one shenanigans, but also to enable junglers to take this keystone and start with a jungle item without feeling like they&rsquo;re missing out on too much. Laners can still opt to start boots, but will have to lane for a few minutes before going out on their first hunt.\n\nWith that all said, you may be wondering how we got to putting an active effect on boots. It&rsquo;s a bit of a story, so gather &lsquo;round and listen up for some Rune history:\n\n&lsquo;Hunting power&rsquo; generally means &lsquo;power to impact other lanes,&rsquo; and in League of Legends, that can be very oppressive. So, starting from early on in development, we knew we had to limit the frequency of this sort of rune. Early attempted iterations included: requiring a number of unique champion takedowns before getting access to it, swapping or augmenting one of your summoner spells to it, and lastly, putting it on a fixed global timer that automatically activated the hunt for all with the rune every 5 minutes. \n\nThat last one (fixed timer) had some real promise, but it would activate at useless times (while dead) and often pressured the user into using it at all costs, leading to some questionable tower dives. While this was its own sort of fun, it became apparent that we had to put more agency in the players&rsquo;s hands. We experimented with many triggers to let the player choose when to use it (both here and in other runes), but to little success - nothing quite felt as satisfying or natural as pressing a button. Part of the struggle here was our desire to hook into existing systems rather than layering on new runes-specific buttons (a slippery slope of complexity). So, when someone suggested adding an active to the item that *almost* every champion buys, we had to try it. It was an immediate hit and got us what we wanted - hunt power, a long cooldown, and an intentional trigger. We have some worries and are playing close attention to negative side effects (such as sheer number of active items, especially on supports), but it looks like active boots will be here to stay!\n\nNow that we have some Keystones out there (Meteor, Perxie etc), hopefully the system is starting to take shape for you. We&rsquo;ll be around to answer questions and meme, so let us know what you think of this latest rune! \n\n_________\n\nYou can check the previous Runes Corner posts here:\nRunes Corner: [Runes Content Development Peek](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/pt/c/developer-corner/MZd3jemX-runes-corner-runes-content-development-peek)\nRunes Corner: [Meteor Sneak Peek](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/pt/c/developer-corner/nVHz5tjE-runes-corner-meteor-sneak-peek)","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-07-19T21:15:08.150+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice! I'm both excited *and* terrified of the power we see here, and I hope the other Keystones are this level of impactful -- this one feels far more engaging than the meteor previewed previously because there's more control and more conscious decision-making required.\n\nTwo related design questions for you, if you have a moment!\n\n----------------------------\n\n\\#1 -- Why do you feel it's worth using a boots active for this particular design space? To me that feels like it cuts out a lot of possibilities in the future, as now the ONLY things you can put on boots actives are Keystone Masteries, as otherwise it would create impossible complexities with this item. To me that feels like a potentially wasted opportunity since, as you said, there's a lot of exciting stuff you can do by hooking a feature up to an item everyone buys (or through a return to the boots enchantment style we saw before, which it seems something like this would be awesome for).\n\nIn short, what made you decide the benefit here was worth effectively locking that design space to Keystone Masteries for good (or for as long as the ability exists)?\n\nBecause personally I'd be wondering if a Kindred-style interface for abilities like this might be a better fix, since it leaves the boots slot open and abilities like this will rarely be instant-cast in combat simply due to their warm-up time. Having to mouse over to an icon or menu of some sort for this seems like about the ONLY time a solution like that wouldn't feel super clunky. I get that there are numerous downsides to that (would have to do more analysis on how much time/effort/attention it takes to use), but it could open up a UI option for future effects (Rift Herald summoning, etc) that aren't in-combat usage, while also preserving the design space. Bonus points: Cassiopeia could still use it.\n\nOr, heck, a second button for a \"functionality\" wheel that acts like the ping wheel but with items on it. Sort of like the weapon selection menu in a lot of FPSs. Again, would have to do some thinking on where/how to implement that, but it would be speedy for things like this and, again, open up space for other abilities in the future as well.\n\n\\#2 -- Since we now will have two forms of \"channel-while-moving,\" could we get a specific differentiation between the two (or more) types? It seems we have a few forms that all follow different rules, and it's not living up to the clarity that most of *League*'s rules have.\n\nAs is, I see the following types:\n\n* Stationary, damage or CC interrupts (Recall)\n* Stationary, only CC interrupts (Teleport, Fiddlesticks, etc)\n* Mobile, damage or CC interrupts (Edge of Night, Hunt of the Blood Moon)\n* Mobile, only CC interrupts (~~not present in the game, but an interesting design space for the future, possibly for something like an AoE effect~~)\\*\n\n\\***Edit:** As others have mentioned, this effect does exist in things like Varus and Xerath. My brain was just off.\n\nIt would be nice to have a better way to differentiate these effects (especially if the fourth type is ever used on a champion or item), even if only the *static* and *mobile* types were differently named, and the damage breaking effect were specified each time.\n\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Reinboom","date":"2017-07-19T21:53:06.551+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"1: That's a great analysis of design space restriction.\n\nShort term looking, being afraid of space restriction for the sake of space restriction itself (with cautionary notes of long term, I'll get there) means that we'll never use that design space. Effectively, it means we've \"wasted\" the space in a different way, by not utilizing it.\n\nLong term looking, it's important to look at what types of content are consuming a space. In shorter lifespans (think 2 years or less time), systemic content like Runes (or items, or summoners) can be removed when they are discovered to not provide sufficient benefit for the space they consume. By compliment, this also means that trying out these spaces in systemic content can be very fruitful - that is if we don't remove it then it's implied the content was good enough for that space, or can be iterated there.\n\nTwo major limits to this is 1) if the content that's consuming the space has a high potential attachment. See: Champions. Space consumed by champions is pretty much there to stay as a default assumption. Also, see: Old runes. Consuming attractive space with old runes (not that they would...) is an issue because of IP investments. Also 2) If the game becomes dependent on the consumed space. See: Flash. Curating Runes at this point to deliver on choice is much easier for us to do now then at release, however, and as long as there is choice then dependency takes longer to build.\n\n\nKeystones are also interesting in particular for this exact conversation. Most major pieces of content actually have a button associated with them, meaning that the desire and payoff for consumption is rather low. Keystones in particular sit on that edge, where they are strong enough that in some cases (see: This reveal) they may warrant a button (where mindspace allows, though that's a whole conversation on its own), and yet don't have a button to hook to. To me, this makes Keystones very appropriate movers on this particular space.\n\n2: I like the proposal of naming channels differently. Though, in this case, just adding _mobile_ is appropriate (no need to over describe the list that contains \"etc.\"). We found that for the most part this is easy to feel out, but your proposal works if it becomes more of an issue.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-07-19T22:08:04.437+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Reinboom,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=hFIemE4p,comment-id=000b0000,timestamp=2017-07-19T21:53:06.551+0000)1: That&#x27;s a great analysis of design space restriction.\n\nWhy thank you!

Effectively, it means we&#x27;ve &quot;wasted&quot; the space in a different way, by not utilizing it.\n\nThis definitely makes a ton of sense, specifically with what you said in the next paragraph. It definitely is a Keystone that seems like it would be easy to remove or re-position elsewhere if this design space found a more useful hook later...although I imagine doing that would require paying a clarity and information cost to the playerbase now accustomed to this previous implementation, yes? Still, probably worth it in the long run, especially since it does allow experimentation into unused design spaces.\n\n>To me, this makes Keystones very appropriate movers on this particular space.\n\nMake sense and, to a large extent, I completely agree -- it just feels a little odd to me since it's the ONLY Keystone that hooks into that space, rather than it being used for Keystones in general. Of course, there's the possibility of more in the future, certainly...\n\nEither way, I really appreciate the in-depth response! Although it seems, amusingly, that the answer to the question might be \"we weren't using that spot and someone came up with an idea for it, and we didn't have anything else planned for it in the near future so figured we'd test it out.\" Which is possibly A: actually the BEST reason for doing it, and B: a far simpler explanation than I was expecting! :D\n\n> 2: I like the proposal of naming channels differently.

I guess my concern is that newer players would read \"you can move while channeling\" on things like Edge of Night and assume it applies to all channels. Which might be a minor concern, all things considered. I also realize I totally forgot movement channels, which can be stopped by roots, and attacking channels (Lucian ult) which can apparently be stopped by blinds. So many channels! It's like I have a cable TV package. :P","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Reinboom","date":"2017-07-19T22:37:25.449+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Either way, I really appreciate the in-depth response!

The first attempt at the space replaced your Ghost summoner spell, and then acted very much like the Demon Brand you have in the Hunt of the Blood Moon game mode (invisibility and all). This Rune was... ... an interesting study of interactions (Riven combo setup so easy with invisibility omg). That is, it very much started as \"Hey. Let's do that thing. It's awesome!\"\n\nThe piece that survived was less the execution space and more the decision space. The \"hunt\" keystone.\n\nStashu independently devised a Keystone not too dissimilar to the Demon Brand / Summoner Spell version that was the actual direct ancestor to the previewed Hunt of the Blood Moon Keystone. That keystone was targeting the space specifically. Initially, it was actually just a passive: every 3 minutes... once out of combat... it triggers the hunt. The output was appropriate for the game, though the activation condition felt like a lot of game control was stripped away.\n\nFurther discussion brought us to realizing we needed to return to a button, but couldn't amp the power so far as to replace a summoner spell like before. Those conversations naturally brought us to where it is now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BFG Heart","date":"2017-07-20T05:52:15.581+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope we can expect a keystone for enchanters (Nami, Lulu, Janna, Soraka) {{champion:267}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:40}} a replacement rune keystone for windspeaker's blessing.

Runes are meant to have a wide audience, but some champions have especially unique kits that break certain rules, which excludes them from runes that hook into the common system that they are sidestepping at a kit level. If we can find a solution that allows her access to it in some way without compromising it for other users, that'd be ideal, and I'd love to do that, but no promises.","replies":[{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2017-07-19T21:13:19.873+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the answer Stash, do you feel this may furhter increase active item burden?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Stashu","date":"2017-07-19T21:20:10.600+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, a little, which is bad. That said, I think this is going to be very low impact in that regard, since it's a huge cooldown and can really only be used out of combat, so it will rarely be competing with your other active items. I think the biggest problem with lots of actives is having to use them all in rapid succession in a team fight and getting your fingers all jumbled up on your keyboard. It's still not great to put in a bunch of active items, but avoiding this case gets us a lot of room.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kyunsei","date":"2017-07-19T21:06:50.818+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to league of Jungle easy peasy gank.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Penns","date":"2017-07-19T21:37:36.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Moly 15 seconds, cd is high too tho.\nEnchanting boots with an active effect sounds interesting, but what about very late game games where you would want to sell them for a 6th item? :o","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Stashu","date":"2017-07-19T21:45:36.062+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Probably not worth when you have these bad boys ;).\n\nThat said, you can use them, sell your boots, and then buy them again in 180s.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"big boi edri","date":"2017-07-19T21:21:39.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This may have been answered already, but is this like a keystone?
