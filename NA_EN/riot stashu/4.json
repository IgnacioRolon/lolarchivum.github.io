Sorry for not having the Cassiopeia discussion on Boards earlier. The discussion on GD has been going pretty strong for a while now, and I've learned a lot from it, but it's definitely about time I brought this over here. (Also, sorry for not posting there in the past week or two).\r\n\r\nI'd love to discuss everybody's experience on Cassiopeia since the update, but I think I should first address the concerns about her identity and power level. Also, as it's come up a number of times, I'll include a more detailed background about what inspired this update and how we got to where we are today. It's quite long, so I'll throw that at the end of this post for those of you who are interested.\r\n\r\nLet's start with the more pressing issue. On top problems from a balance perspective, Cassiopeia has lost a lot of her poison feel. This is the bigger pain point for most, and we definitely understand where everyone is coming from. Much of what has historically contributed to Cassiopeia feeling like the 'Snake Mage' is her poison DoT's, and, as these have been deemphasized, she's lost some of this -- well, to be more specific, we inadvertently took it away. It was never the intention to strip her Snake Mage identity, but we agree that we've done so in trying to meet other goals with the kit. This has left Cassiopeia in clear need of our attention, and we're really sorry about that.\r\n\r\nFurther, while she's statistically in line with several other champions in League (Twitch, Lee Sin, Elise), there are still some power concerns regarding her kit. That is, skilled players can take advantage of many of the challenging aspects of these champions' kits in order to overcome their inherent weaknesses (Lee Sin and Elise can overcome their lack of innate tankyness with mobility and cc, and Twitch can overcome his range disadvantage by using his stealth to get in range of his opponents). It has become abundantly clear that on top of being rather difficult to play, Cassiopeia has weaknesses which her kit can't answer. In isolation, this is okay or even good, champions should have clear weaknesses, but they should also have appropriately powerful and relevant strengths. Cassiopeia's strength, her damage, is gated sufficiently that despite how high it can be, it's not contributing enough to overcome her clear and often crippling weakness (namely a combination of range and mobility that just leave her terribly unsafe, particularly in lane). \r\n\r\nWith all this is mind, the primary reason why we had no changes for 4.18 is that we still haven't fully determined which tools to add to/bolster on Cassiopeia's kit. We know that we can buff her stats to a point where she's strong, but we're spending some extra time to ensure that our changes do everything we want them to (namely, reinforce her Snake Mage identity). We've been moving a bit more slowly than we (and I'm sure all of you) would like, but resources have been a little tight (we have a lot of awesome stuff in the works for pre-season! Coming to pbe soon :D). \r\n\r\nThat said, I plan on getting some Cassiopeia changes into testing with the target of finalizing them by the next patch or two. Our goals here are to preserve the direction Cassiopeia has gone in (high mechanical skill, combo-casting, late game carry mage), but add back some of the poison feeling that was lost along the way. These changes won't be on the scale of the original update, but we won't be hesitant to change mechanics/abilities more significantly where appropriate. The primary candidate here is Twin Fang-- we're considering having Twin Fang play into the DoT game somehow, perhaps through increasing poison damage to its target. Not sure if this is going to be what we ultimately land on, but that should give you an idea of how we're thinking here.\r\n\r\nI know it may feel like we've abandoned or forgotten about Cassiopeia to some degree, but I promise you it's something I think about every day. I'm eager to bring Cassiopeia into a place where people are happy with her, especially those who used to love playing this Champion. While the GD discussion got a bit overwhelming, know that I've read the majority of your feedback and we're trying to figure out how to best respond to the problems you've all helped to identify. \r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who has been raising visibility on and contributing to the discussions surrounding Cassiopeia, and thanks for caring. We'll do our best to make her the best Champion she could be.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------- \r\nMain post: over. Detailed history of the project below for those who are interested. It's really long, so, sorry about that!\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nBackground: Cassiopeia was in line for a texture/art update since she was a bit old-fashioned and could use a little work both in general but also for her appearance as it will fit on the new Summoners Rift. With this in mind, we saw a good opportunity to add some gameplay updates to Cassiopeia, so we decided to look into it and see if she could benefit from any. This led to some deep analysis, and after a lot of discussion, we identified some problems on the kit. Casseopia's damage profile (spamable, high damage, AoE DoT's) made her impossible to balance and fight against when strong and had some readability/satisfaction problems on top of that. Additionally, much of Cassiopeia's kit was nondistinct and, though she was unique in some ways, we felt she could be more interesting than a 'vanilla' mage than she already was. \r\n\r\nHence, our planned changes primarily revolved around identifying and clarifying her identity. Our results: Cassiopeia had good AoE damage, but she wasn't *the* AoE mage. She also had good control, but she wasn't *the* control mage. She used damage over time, but she wasn't *the* DoT mage-- Brand, Rumble, Swain, Zyra, Malzahar, and even Mordekaiser compete in many/all of these fields. However, it was quite clear that compared to other mages, Cassiopeia stood nearly alone when it came to consistent DPS output. \r\n\r\nEven previously, those who knew her well feared Cassiopeia as the highest damage output mage in the game-- and this occasionally led to some very interesting strategies, even in the competitive scene, like the Yorick/Cassiopeia Zombie-Snake combo. Karthus admittedly was a close competitor here, but we recognized differences between him and Cassiopeia wanted to push them a bit further (have to mention Ryze as well, but his thing is tanky/reliable damage, more than the highest damage possible).\r\n\r\nFor Cassiopeia, this meant emphasizing her single target damage and her utility surrounding it. On the flip-side, this also meant de-emphasizing her AoE damage (and as a result, her DoT damage). In some ways, we were certainly happy about this, as there are some design problems surrounding the satisfaction/power ratio and readability of DoTs. In others, we were less happy. Poison has been an important part of Cassiopeia's thematic identity, and a part of it that many people have deeply enjoyed, so this direction was dampening that a bit and thus costly in that sense. However, truthfully the poison aspects of her kit were not integral to its gameplay even as it stood before--one could argue that Twin Fang depends on the target being poisined, but her Q/W could just as easily applied a non-poison marker which enabled E-resets and retained nearly identical gameplay. I could imagine a Champion's kit that depends on a thematic poison identity to work with its gameplay (a debuff-focused champion comes to mind), but Cassiopeia would likely have to change dramatically to become this. Our changes here were focused on driving Cassiopeia into a unique area which emphasized many of the things she already was doing, not switching her role entirely.\r\n\r\nAs a brief aside, I'd like to explain a bit about how why we decided to push Cassiopeia so far in one particular direction-- bare with me for a moment. Consider Cassiopeia, and, side-by-side, consider a nearly identical champion, except one who uses nukes instead of DoTs (imagine all the other mechanics stay the same, like her Q applies a 3 second marker to the target that resets her Twin Fang when it hits them). Do these champions bring anything different to a team? Of course, there are some differences between DoTs and Nukes that would likely result in minor number changes, but, overall these champions would be doing largely the same thing, with largely the same damage. Now consider Cassiopeia again, but with half her damage and twice the crowd control effects, and compare that to a Cassiopeia with twice the damage but no crowd control (forgetting for a moment whether or not these champions would be balanced). These two champions have clear strategic differences, as they bring dramatically different things to a team (in this case, general damage vs general crowd control). As the League roster grows and grows, Champions need to occupy more and more specific niches to be unique, and this general damage vs general crowd control difference is no longer meaningful.\r\n\r\nThis is the line of thinking that brought us to distilling Cassiopeia to the highest -- single target -- late game -- consistent damage -- mage. This is a particular space that Cassiopeia can maker her own, not shared with any other champion; unlike DoT mage, for example. It does have some differences compared to her pre-update identity, but it comes directly from the unique things about her that we identified and wanted to support. We may not have gotten the numbers right here for her to hit each of these aspects, but that's the goal and we're still working towards it.\r\n\r\nNow, there may have been better ways to tie the poison thematic (or more importantly, the DoT feel) into this identity than the ones we landed on (the ones we settled on being certain aspects of her passive and Miasma slowing more). One idea that has arisen both internally and on the forums is something like making E into 'Corrosive Fang:' Deals some minor damage to the target and increases all poison damage to the target by x% for y seconds, stacks up to z times. This wouldn't change her gameplay at all (she would still mark targets with Q/W then hit them with a bunch of E's, and continue to try to land Qs, just as she does now and even before), and thus wouldn't add anything particularly poison-y to it, but it certainly goes some way towards amping up her poison thematics and adding back some poisony feel. While this particular version has some problems, I quite like the goals and direction and it's something I'd like to take a stab at.\r\n\r\nIn any case, that's a more detailed look into our thought processes and the story behind this update. Hope that helps/explains some stuff!\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTLDR; We could meet our goals of keeping Cassioepeia's use case (namely, late game single target mage carry) unique and special while amping up her thematics and making it more of what everyone wants from the Snake Mage. And that's where we're going in the next set up updates!","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-10-10T06:06:06.138+0000","up_votes":62,"down_votes":6,"body":"While I'm glad you're looking at Cass, you still have some feelings that worry me.

He has one dot spell on his ult, and you never even use it for the dot! you use it for the % hp up front burst combined with the reward of assassinated the marked target.\n\nAlso, brand is only even remotely close to a dot mage due to his passive, but his success case has always been as a combo mage for huge burst and situational utility.\n\nRumble and swain are the closest to dot mages on this list as you'll ever get. (I won't touch on malz, cuz you guys have brought that up almost a thousand times) but even then, rumble is a front line unit designed for positional plays with his ult. But at the end of the day, he isn't about his raw dmg output, but rather his powerful zone control and beefy tankiness. Swain is closer to karthus in his playstyle as an unkillable monster if he get's rolling. The problem with swain however is that his ult is a dps ult, not a dot. His ult chunks ever few secs rather than the fast burn of a dot like his decrepify and torment. But the cd's on those two spells are high enough to prevent him from having a 100% uptime on his dots thus limiting how much of an impact he can have with the dot theme.\n\nCass, on the other hand, was able to keep a 100% uptime on her dots with proper cdr and successful landing of her skill shots. Throw in a rylais and liandri's and cass was capable of burning down even the most tanky of champs given enough time (which wasn't much). Her E was almost always used as an 'emergency pistol' effect if someone all-in'd her or if she knew she had the dmg to go for a safe kill.\n\nIn the end, the fact that cass was able to keep 100% uptime on her poison was the strongest aspect that tied her to the poison-snakelady dot theme unlike all of her competition in the dot field.\n\nsadly, it doesn't matter that I'm saying all this cuz it's just gonna get buried in this nesting and will prob never get read by riot at all. :/\n\nEDIT: I think I'ma repost this as a main post in the thread to see if it can get some visibility.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crownsy","date":"2014-10-10T18:14:56.848+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea i pretty much rolled my eyes and stopped taking his \"direction\" for the champ seriously at that point.

I have summarized all its drawbacks thusly:\n\nIt makes her early game incredibly pitiful. Not readjusting her mana costs accordingly pigeonholes her build into a forced tear start. She requires so much time to gain maximum stacks that she won't have them until the 30-40 minute mark, and in the early game, she requires having her lane opponent remain in the lane as long as he will to have an adequate number of stacks by mid game. As a result of getting so much AP late game via her passive, Riot slashed her Q scaling and E and W base damage; Cass needs 700 AP break even with old Cass's E damage. This gutted her AoE capability and forced her into strictly single-target damage. Since she receives 30% CDR from stacks, Riot also uncoupled her Q-E combo before that 30% CDR point by increasing the base cooldown of Q to 4 seconds. She can no longer keep a target permanently poisoned for continuous E casts until she has 30% CDR or overcaps herself on CDR by building it early. The AP-amplifying component of her passive means that in order to function optimally doing damage, she is forced to build those items that grant maximum AP, further reducing build variability. All of these changes were implemented as a direct response to this atrocious passive that makes her weaker than a kitten until the 30-minute mark.","replies":[{"poster":"Neo Cyrus","date":"2014-10-10T05:22:30.666+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":3,"body":"Honestly she doesn't even have an early game or mid game. 2 hits of Space AIDS from Malzahar murders Cass early game, there is no realistic way for her to lane against many things in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"lceman","date":"2014-10-10T07:02:14.091+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree but it doesn't even have to be Malz.

The one she has feels like it would be more at home on veigar (thematically) than it does on cass.

After playing over 4 yrs of league I've played all kinds of matches. And I've played matches that have lasted for well over an hour. After a certain point more dmg is meaningless. You need defense and utility not pure glass cannon dmg to finish out a match. This is why ryze has such a ridiculous late game while no one ever plays veigar professionally. Sure, veig can get some of the best burst in the game, but when he's squishy as heck and his opponents all have BV and/or GA it really doesn't matter how much ap veig has, he just can't compete. Ryze on the other hand, gets strong by building tanky due to his mana scaling.

That having been said, this is long overdue. Moving on.\n\nCassiopeia, having multiple AoE damage over time spells, was indeed a far more primary DoT mage than any of the examples you've brought up. Brand's DoT is in his passive, roughly equivalent to Darius's bleeding damage. Rumble and Mord offer DoT in their ult, so it's situational throughout the game as opposed to the bread and butter of their kits. Only Malzahar can really compare and they are so different that I don't think anyone is stepping on anyone's toes here. \n\nThere is a middle ground here, and I don't think that choosing it means the champ doesn't have \"niche appeal\". A champ doesn't have to be the best at something, there's too many champions for them all to be the best at something.\n\nIf you want to continue this \"late game hyper damage\" thing, why isn't her damage increased based on her level as opposed to stacks? One of the biggest complaints we have is that in most games Cassiopeia can't reach her potential. That wouldn't be such a big deal except that if she can't reach her potential she never becomes relevant. Nobody wants to pick a champion who has a good chance of not even getting their turn at bat. \n\nI don't support the concept of adding poison buffs to her twin fang - there's too much focus on twin fang already. It doesn't make sense for a champ to have two AoE DoT spells, an AoE hard CC ultimate, and one single-target nuke... and have the focus of her one viable playstyle be spamming the nuke. Spamming the nuke is central to her kit, sure. But it's the deal closer. It's what you do when you are ready to all in. It doesn't need to 2-shot everyone to be relevant, it was always relevant. It can stand to lose a little damage in order to increase poison damage. Q requires some skill to land - it should be rewarding to do so. It wouldn't even need as much of a damage buff if she could cast it while moving, ala Syndra.\n\nThank you for touching base with us and please, PLEASE continue to converse with us.

Her passive. I think the developers forgot the most important part about making a champion, are they FUN to play. Is current cass fun to play? No, not even the slightest. Knowing you have to stay in lane nearly for 20+ minutes just to make yourself semi-useful for your teammates isn't anyone's idea of fun. I think most dedicated mids would rather play support then try and play Cass now, at least as support you can make a difference and not be a liability for your team. If i'm in mid, and my opponent decides to go gank bottom or top, not like I can really follow him and help my team. Sure I'll be there, I might be able to land a poison to 2, and do...next to nothing damage, and probably get myself killed, is that really helpful in the game? Is that really taking Cass or league in the direction it should be going? I think you were so focused on giving Cass counterplay and gating her 'power' that you forgot to actually giver her the ability to counterplay other champions. I\"d almost be scared to fight a urgot with current cass in 1v1 early or mid game.\n\nHer passive is just to weak right now to be of any use. So it's 25 minutes in a game, you have 300 stacks( my opponent has left at this point and is roaming the jungle and making my team hate me because I can't afford to leave), and lets say a...Tear, rabadons, Zhonyas and a void Staff, plus your other needed items in pvp, wards, boots, etc. So i'm sitting on 303 base AP or around there, with my passive at only 300 stacks i'm getting a whole whooping...30.3 AP from that. So you mean to tell me, that veigar can kill 30 minions and get my AP that I just spent Almost the entire game getting? Thanks. Or even Nasus siphoning strike, if he kills 30 minions, his is doing a extra 90 damage. 30 additional AP on cass's current scalings is trivial, it's not even noticeable. The power jump from 200 stacks to 400 is just to dramatic, sure she has cooldown reduction, not like that REALLY helps since you raised her cooldowns.\n\nAs long as her passive remains the same, I seriously doubt you'll get good criticism on cass. It's just to much of a hassle for so very little reward. You've gated her 10 'difficulty' into being how well can you last hit a enemy that's poisoned, which is pretty difficult for most people. So...congrats? You made a extremely difficult champion alright, to bad her difficulty doesn't have any pay off, and very little relevance to the game.\n\n If you have to suffer the entire game to get your power spike, I think you SHOULD be able to roflstomp just about anyone who get's in your way. Even if you have to add \"be level 16+ and a fully stacked passive\" catches on her abilities, I don't care.

But Cassiopeia?\n\n\n\nThe rework have been riddled with problems [**and I've went into massive detail here**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/GD/rqv8AInZ-i-am-saying-this-in-as-polite-a-way-as-possible-stashu-you-do-not-get-cassiopeia-the-rework-shows) (hint: that Passive of hers is *NOT FUN*, it is  a *CHORE* that un-subtly only exists to gate her power rather than aid her) But responding to just what you typed down here...............\n\n> She used damage over time, but she wasn't the DoT mage-- **Brand**, Rumble, Swain, **Zyra**, Malzahar, and even Mordekaiser compete in many/all of these fields.\n\n*-twitches psychotically-*\n\nYou see, I've mentioned this before and I'll mention it again...I have a very strong reason to believe that you still don't truly understand what DoT even is. Asides from the fact that you brought up Brand, who is identified for, asides from his inability to exist in the meta, his combo-burst damage, his Passive being icing on the cake.\n\nMore importantly, Zyra...DoT...you see, I kinda really question whether you know what DoT is. More importantly, Zyra can't even be called a DoT mage anymore as she's much more of a turret-based support after her repeated nerfs making going mid as her horribly impractical.\n\n\nThe fact that you consider the likes of Rumble and Mordekaiser as \"more DoT\" than Cassiopeia is astounding. The fact that you don't realize the difference between Malzahar's DoT and Cassiopeia's style is worrying too.\n\nAnd again,\n\n> as there are some design problems surrounding the satisfaction/power ratio and readability of DoTs.\n\nThis is a view that I PASSIONATELY disagree with, as her DoT was exactly why I enjoyed playing her for. Malzahar doesn't even compare(he has his own unique problems). Swain is a single-target DoT mage. Mordekaiser has an ultimate and a shield that also happens to deal some damage overtime.\n\n\nCassiopeia was THE DoT mage thanks to the fact that she have two reliable AoE poison-nukes. More importantly, her W is unmatched in a siege.\n\n\nI really can't stand it when Riot says DoT is unsatisfying and unreadable. This is exactly the line of thinking that resulted in Draven getting his uninspired gold-passive rather than just getting his Passive nerfed instead.\n\n\n**edit:** You know what? Upon further thought, I'm doubting Malzahar as being anywhere near Cassiopeia at all as a DoT mage. He inflicts DoT, but his pattern plays like that of a burst mage. His success relies  upon comboing all of his abilities together to 100-0 his opponents like a burst mage rather than a true DoT mage. Cassiopeia is able to whittle down and erode away the enemy champions with her Poison.\n------\n**tl;dr** - I'll give you credit for trying to reach out and talk about Cassiopeia and all that. But MAN do you shoot yourself in the foot whenever you talk about DoT and begin comparing her to Brand and Zyra...and Mordekaiser...\n\n\n\n**PS** - why are you so insistent on focusing on the most hated ability in her kit (Twin Fangs)? That ability has always been the black sheep in her kit. Why not give** AoE DoT mage** a chance? That was when she was FUN, and it's a niche no other champions competently achieves.\n\n\nBecause Cassiopeia's DoT is Poison, enemies are still afflicted even if they walk out, that's what makes it so satisfying. With Malzahar, he either has a low range single-target DoT, or an AoE DoT zone that can be walked out of unless the enemy is cc'd.\n\nRumble and Mordekaiser's really damaging DoT abilities are stuck on stupidly high cooldown ultimates. Swain's DoT are all single-target. Brand...stop bringing Brand into this! And stop bringing \"supports\" with zero DoT as examples of DoT mages!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Robot Jake","date":"2014-10-10T23:47:06.613+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"Usually I tend to stay off the forums, but for once I think I have to share my two cents. Bit of background: I'm a massively casual League player, I tend to stay as far away from Ranked and play Normals/ARAMs. Having said that, I do have several friends in the platinum/diamond skill range, meaning I've been up against players of that skill level. I usually get stomped, of course, and I'd say my own skill level is somewhere around Silver - if I'm being generous. On a good day. However I'd like to think I've played enough to have a solid idea of game mechanics.\n\nThe reason I'm posting today is that Cassiopeia was, by far, one of my favorite midlane champions. She was a veeeeery close second after Brand, and far above anyone else. And now I absolutely detest her.\n\nThe rework tried to focus on her identity as a hypercarry, single target burst mage. My problem with the rework is that I NEVER PLAYED HER AS SUCH. The Cassio I loved playing was a sustained damage, kite-oriented CC mage. Usually by way of a heavy magic penetration focus with a Rylai's on top. By landing Q on champions - probably the most mechanically challenging part of her kit outside combos - Cassio could use the speed boost to kite people around the map, occasionally turning around to land an E when tactically appropriate. Her old passive meant I could focus on rushing this MPen + Rylai's combo in the early game without worrying too much about mana. The old Cassio could still run out of mana, but with due diligence in keeping her passive up this took a while. If it really was a problem, or you lane opponent was more aggressive than you (re: Talon/Zed), Catalyst into Rod of Ages was always an option. She could definitely burst people down when needed, but that required her to remain immobile, while my old playstyle rewarded picking your shots, only turning around when you knew you had a kill on your hands and saving your ult for problematic situations.\n\nNowadays, her new passive locks her into a single build path - late-game hypercarry. Build a Tear into Archangel's. Rod of Ages remains a solid choice, but is more important than before due to her fragility. Rabaddon's, Void Staff, etc. Standard cookie cutter build. Her early game is now focused exclusively on last-hitting minions with E in order to afford her hypercarry itemization, and that demands enough attention that being bullied out of lane is excessively easy, especially since long periods of immobility are now required to get her full damage output out. Her late game isn't even that satisfying. Stacking her passive, to me at least, feels like a massive chore - a constant reminder that if I get shut down in the early game, that's it. Passive is useless because I'm not getting to late game anyways. Game's over for me.\n\nI was ecstatic when I saw this post talking about changes to the Cassiopeia rework, yet my heart sank when I saw the phrase \"Our goals here are to preserve the direction Cassiopeia has gone in\". I don't see myself ever playing the new Cassiopeia when I can instead play Brand or Malzahar - my new number 2 APC - and actually get to play a DoT champ the way I want. Later in the post, you talk about a Cassio with \"Half her damage, and twice the CC\". I for one much prefer that direction for Cassiopeia. De-emphasize her hypercarry potential and the damage from her E, and focus on her poison abilities instead. More work? Definitely. But certainly better than the sorry state she's in now.\n\nTL:DR; Cassiopeia is way more interesting as a sustained damage kite-mage than a late-game hypercarry. I understand taking her so far in one direction to give her a clear identity. I just think you're going in entirely the wrong direction.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ceaselessphantom","date":"2014-10-10T20:50:18.536+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stashu regardless of our views of poison mage vs e spam and lane bully vs strong late game\n\nPretty much all of us hate the stacking mechanic.

Most of them rely on a burst pattern that happens to have some DoT mixed in, but ultimately they play no different than a full burst champion.

Cassio was a lane bully and should've stayed a lane bully. Ideally (in my opinion), any changes to her should have toned down her laning power *slightly* in a way that would give opponents meaningful ways to play around her while simultaneously giving her some much needed QOL changes (standardizing the E cooldown, for example). Everything that's been done beyond that just radically changed the way the champion was played with no regard to the people who enjoyed her the way she was before.\n\nYou can argue, perhaps, that a DoT focused Cassio would be similar in *playstyle* to other champions, Ziggs being a very obvious one. But you fail to take into consideration how they *feel.* That may be irrelevant when the question of competitive diversity comes up, but honestly, you're probably going to ruin a lot on the path to getting there.

Many are picking apart different parts and some are doing a better job than I so I simply want to jump right to your TLDR summary:\n\n\n> TLDR; We could meet our goals of keeping Cassiopeia's use case (namely, late game single target mage carry) unique and special while amping up her thematics and making it more of what everyone wants from the Snake Mage. And that's where we're going in the next set up updates!\n\nI really hope that you _don't_ further push the goal of a single target late mage carry.   Beyond the particulars of execution I'd argue it's even a flawed goal.\n\nIf we strip the cass identity for a moment and just look at what it is you're creating ... you're a creating a niche that doesn't even fit the meta.  Just think about that for a second **you are creating a character to fill a roll that has no place in the current league team makeups and thus effectively tabling her from use until the meta changes.**  The very concept tables Cassiopeia.  \n\nThe most successful mid laners snow ball early, dominate mid game ... and abuse that power to roam and impact the other lanes.   In addition they need very little babysitting from the jungler ... they tend to get it  because the current meta favors this playstyle, but should the jungler be needed elsewhere they usually have mobility, CC, or something to give them an out.\n\nThis new kit grants no mobility or cc ... but even worse ties the mage to midlane.  Roaming impacts stacks ... so this \"new niche\" basically destroys the midlane value of the champion ... ironically it makes the champion more suited to another lane such as top ... something that traditionally holds and farms until late game.  But with all the DOT power stripped the champ can't even really do that ... \n\nNo ... what we've really created is a champion that can only thrive in bot lane ... aka useless until fed so needs a support in tow.   We created a magical carry modelled after an ADC ... but now expected to survive in a new lane.  Unless there's some cool itemization coming down the pike that might make a bot lane Cassi Carry viable ... we've basically create a champion for a **role that doesn't exist**.\n\nThe design goals are fundamentally broken.  The only way it will work is if you over-buff her so she's so strong she functions anyway otherwise she will get shelved until a meta shift occurs ... a major one that emphasises a magic hyper-carry at the 40 minutes mark ... a position that the ADC hold a monopoly on.  If the meta DOES shift ... you'll just come back and nerf her into the ground because she'll suddenly be over-qualified.\n\nPlease don't ignore the complaints on her thematic feel being lost, either.  That is another very big and very real problem.  I'm simply pointing out that there a more fundamental one as well.  Again I appreciate the feedback but this cassi re-work project is just a fundamental failure at a number of levels and NEEDS to be reconsidered for the good of the character.\n\nMy only lingering hope is maybe she has some sick ultimate skin in the pipe so suddenly she's on the radar again ... because I'm not quite sure why she hit the limelight otherwise :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"AsToldByGinger","date":"2014-10-11T03:51:26.407+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"so you guys were just gonna visually update her then tacked on some attempt to \"update\" her gameplay? you guys on \"deeper analysis\" decided to change her gameplay. even if the buttons you're pressing follow the same pattern as before it's still different. it means something different. it feels different. its not practically the same thing. you guys imagined this wacky space for her and are now changing her. you think about her everyday cause its your job not because you understand the relationship of characters and their purpose of existence . she's a snake for gods sake. you just throw a ball of stats at her and call her a hyper carry. what cass needed was those bug fixes and then to go from there. not some joe shmoe trying to make some impression a company by adjusting a character into a completely different playstyle. the abilities stayed but shes just a caterpillar now with some chore of a stack system.

They called her a niche pick who perhaps needed only a few quality of life updates such as her E being more reliable and her ult hitting people directly in front of her.\n\nFast forward to a few weeks before they dropped the bomb on her and all of a sudden Riot is up in arms about how terrible of a bully she is. It's clear that the gameplay update was completely tacked on and rushed out for no reason so they were coming up with any justifications that they could.\n\nThey thought nothing would come of it because of Cassiopeia's small player base.

There is absolutely nothing you can do to help your team win if you lose your lane. You end up being a situational stunbot, if you're lucky enough to be able to cast it. Without flash, you can forget about it. I don't know what your plan was with this, but this new passive will make whatever you are planning borderline impossible. Up until today I've been unsure as to what to think of this remake. I always enjoyed the E style of play so I didn't think it was all that bad. Until I got to see how she does if you do not stomp your lane... The thresholds on the passives are too high. There is no room for error whatsoever. Step of the path for a second and you fall off. Get forced out of lane for one recall or two and you fall off, and God forbid should you get killed before you get to 75 stacks. You're never going to come back.

I also feel I should warn you, this post may come off as hostile, but frankly you are going to hear much worse from others.  Your idea on what her identity is, and what her playstyle should be, is entirely off base and flawed.\n\n\nFirst and foremost. I think it would be best if we established what a rework should actually accomplish:\n\nA rework should do:\n1)  Remove a toxic playstyle (for example, Kassadin....granted the rework didn't entirely succeed at that....it at least removed most of the toxic-ness)\n2) Strengthen a champions identity\n3) Remain faithful to the champions old playstyle\n4) Remove elements that are destructive to the champions identity and playstyle (for example:  Sion)\n5) Ensure that the reworked champion is actually viable.\n6) Ensure that the reworked champion is actually balance-able number wise.\n\n**Important note, this isn't in the order of most important, all of these are EQUALLY important and need to be analyzed on a case by case basis depending on the champion in question**\n\nNow that that has been established a basic understanding of what the true goals of reworking a champion should be, lets have a look and see what your rework accomplished according to this list.\n\nPoint 1)  She didn't have a toxic playstyle.  Therefore point 1 is moot and irrelevant to this champion discussion.\n\nPoint 2)  Her identity was destroyed.  Failed.\n\nPoint 3) Her entire old playstyle was destroyed.  Failed\n\nPoint 4) Arguably Twin Fangs is against her identity, but it was important for her old playstyle (it was her primary weapon to finish the weakened enemy off when she finally all-ins).  But now it is now her only playstyle.  You failed at this objective for a for a slightly different reason reason, it failed because you strengthened something that wasn't core to her identity (in fact it actually was against it) while simultaneously harming her old playstyle (which it was an important part of her old playstyle, but it wasn't the most important part).  Failed\n\nPoint 5) Well, I think it is safe to say this failed utterly.  She has all the weaknesses of old Cass, and none of her previous strengths.  I would go so far to say that she is actually LESS viable than before.  Failed.\n\nPoint 6) Honestly, I don't know about this one.  I think the old Cass would have probably been easier to balance than what we currently have.\n\nI will discuss this further, but I have run out of time and must go off to work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cimexis","date":"2014-10-17T23:26:06.911+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":">The discussion on GD has been going pretty strong for a while now, and I've learned a lot from it, but it's definitely about time I brought this over here.** (Also, sorry for not posting there in the past week or two)**.\n\nIf you were sorry you wouldn't repeat the same mistake. Apology **not** accepted.\nMind starting to actually communicate about what's in plan for Cassiopeia, so people can actually give valid feedback? The longer you remain silent the less civilized this will become.\n\n>TLDR; We could meet our goals of keeping Cassioepeia's use case (namely, late game single target mage carry) unique and special while **amping up her thematics and making it more of what everyone wants from the Snake Mage**. And that's where we're going in the next set up updates! \n\nHow can you possibly believe you can accomplish this without actually asking the playerbase what they think of the changes? So far, the only understanding you've shown with Cassiopeia is from the point of view of her opponent (as in: she's your lane opponent). Why should people trust you to not alienate her even more when you've yet to show if you actually understood what made Cass be Cass for the person who's actually playing her, and then proceed to not communicate about anything?\n\n**How I view this reworks execution: **\nI guess you've at least once in your life either been tasked to write an essey (for instance in high school), or simply had a \"brilliant idea\" right before you fell asleep. In either case, have you tried giving it a view from an objective standpoint a few days later? When you're working on something, you often get \"in the zone\", meaning you become extremely narrow minded and vastly overestimate your work. From my own experience, I've had several esseys where I'd be thinking \"This is the most amazing essey ever\" while writing it, just to reread it later and think \"this is complete garbage\", resuling in me rewriting the whole thing several times before I'm happy with it.\n\n**So the impression I get from the rework is this:** You had this amazing brainstorming where everyone got excited (\"in the zone\"), tossing out one great idea after the other untill you were thinking \"most amazing rework ever\". Then you simply rushed ahead and implemented it before your great ideas/vision for the rework slipped your mind. Then came the PBE phase where the only legitimate communication was about the %CDR. In my ears, this screams that the developers never really reviewed their own work from an objective point of view, simply giving me the impression of saying \"No, you are all wrong.. All your complaints a wrong. Just you wait and see, this rework is amazing\". \n\nAnd then came the live version with 35% win rate and all the continuted negative feedback about the rework, as well as the contunied lack of properly communicating about the feedback. Sure, doing any major changes after the PBE can be viewed as a sign of \"defeat\", as that would imply your amazing vision for the rework didn't work out. However, the result is what we have now, which in my opinion is an extremely unhealthy champion regardless of preformance. If you get ahead, the game is ruined for your opponents. If you fall behind, the game is ruined for your team. (ruined as in taking the fun out of it). I've yet to have a game where I've just gone \"even\". (Quite sure it's close to impossible with her current \"niche\". If you're stronger you mop the floor with them, if you're weaker you cant do shit).\n\n**So to make a conclusion:** My impression is that the development team made this \"amazing idea\" without ever giving it a proper second (objevtive) look. Most work is complete garbage compared to what they become if revisited when you're no longer \"in the zone\". You've then proceeded with the \"give it more time and you'll love it\" mentality. By the time the you've actually taken in the feedback you've shown so much pride about the rework that any major changes would be viewed as a \"defeat\", resulting in you trying to fix it in more subtle ways. The result is in my opinion a **very** unhealthy champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"U4fyn2vZzW","date":"2014-10-13T21:01:07.673+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about just reverting her back to her better state?
