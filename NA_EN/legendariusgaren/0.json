But CS is one thing I judge during game to see how I'm doing versus enemy jungler, and a lot times I'll be behind in level but according to the scoreboard will have an impossibly large cs lead on the enemy jungler almost as if it's ONLY counting jungle minions which sounds silly during a game.","replies":[{"poster":"RisenDarkKnight","date":"2015-11-17T21:41:12.484+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Enemy jungle cs seems to very dramatically in game for me as well.
