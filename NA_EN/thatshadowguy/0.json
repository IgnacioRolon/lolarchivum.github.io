Nice to see the status quo being (somewhat) shaken up, and this is certainly a step forward in terms of League lore.\r\n\r\nThere are still a few things that nag at me, though. Namely, Miss Fortune&#039;s actions throughout the story show a much darker side of her than what we&#039;re used to. This was originally intended to be a big rant about how she comes off as little better than Gangplank, but in retrospect this seems a little obvious to those keeping up with the lore. Long story short, she seems to place her desire for revenge above all else, and doesn&#039;t really give a shit about the long-term consequences of her actions. She &#039;killed&#039; Gangplank in such a way that Bilgewater turns into a complete hellhole in a classic case of Evil Power Vacuum. She also kills a man with a bounty (who was supposed to be brought in alive) and drowns his brother simply because the former worked for Gangplank. Since Captain Fortune is just a skin, unlike Gangplank&#039;s current model, it seems safe to assume she has no interest in leading Bilgewater or even doing anything at all to clean up the mess she&#039;s made.\r\n\r\nNow, of course, here&#039;s the big question: So what? What&#039;s the big deal with having Miss Fortune go grimdark? Why would that be a bad thing? Simply put, because of Darkness-Induced Audience Apathy. If we&#039;re to continue to develop this rivalry, we need a reason to care about these characters. Gangplank was never particularly pleasant, and his character development is best surmised as &#039;grimdark -&gt; grimdarker&#039;, while Miss Fortune&#039;s flaws have already been thoroughly explored in the last paragraph. If they&#039;re both assholes, then why should we care about whether or not they achieve their goals? No matter who wins, Bilgewater loses.\r\n\r\nStill, this is all up to interpretation. As I&#039;ve thought it over a bit, I realized it may be more complex than that. Maybe MF expected her revenge to fix all her problems, and on some level she&#039;s starting to realize this isn&#039;t the case. However, instead of reflecting on it, she&#039;s overcompensating by prolonging the whole process as much as she can. Just one more henchman brought to justice, and maybe the nightmares will stop. Once she burns all the buildings Gangplank once owned, she&#039;ll feel how she was &#039;supposed&#039; to feel.\r\n\r\nPerhaps vengeance feels empty, and she simply doesn&#039;t realize it yet.\r\n\r\nOf course, that could all be a load of crap. What do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2015-08-10T06:41:13.358+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Maybe MF expected her revenge to fix all her problems, and on some level she's starting to realize this isn't the case.

Gangplank took any control Sarah had over her life away from her. Deep down, revenge was about taking back that control, but by successfully enacting that vengeance, for the first time in her life, she felt truly powerful. She thought that bringing down Gangplank would free Bilgewater from the kind of tyranny that Gangplank imposed upon her (from her viewpoint). In many ways she was right, but Bilgewater doesn't function as a democracy and the power vacuum she created destabilized the city. In her mind, destroying every last vestige of Gangplank's power structure is cutting a cancer out of Bilgewater, to make sure it can't happen again. But her view is too myopic, too blinded by her righteous anger, and it's put her on a path that won't be easy to steer away from.\n\nShe's built her life around one goal. It's very difficult to set something like that aside.","replies":[{"poster":"CasterGilgamesh","date":"2015-08-10T22:42:37.791+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"don't tell that to {{champion:429}} though....","replies":[{"poster":"OverpoweredSoap","date":"2015-08-10T22:49:24.511+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EmperorGilgamesh,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=jcfBARQ9,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2015-08-10T22:42:37.791+0000)\n>\n> don't tell that to {{champion:429}} though....\n\nI'm rather curious to see if Miss Fortune would have accepted the \"help\" from {{champion:429}} or {{champion:223}} to kill off Gangplank. \n\nOr would she be too prideful, that she, by herself and her own doing or might, in taking Gangplank herself.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Xulsigae","date":"2015-08-10T08:35:53.490+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"She'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.
