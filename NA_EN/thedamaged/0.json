I took a look into this for you, and it actually looks like you're out of mastery chest drops for the week after you obtained one for Alistar the other day.  You'll have to wait a bit before you can obtain another for the week.  If you're on the legacy client, you can see how many are available in your profile, next to the amount of ARAM rerolls you have.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"thedamaged","date":"2017-01-13T23:54:09.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Porocles,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=xMWBMMNk,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-01-13T22:24:59.720+0000)\n>\n> Thanks for the link!
