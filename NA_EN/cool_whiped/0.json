My ping is only 10 ms when I measure it on speedtest.net and have nothing in the background downloading...any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-13T03:59:15.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Note that the ping you see on speedtest.net is only to their test servers. Each service or game you access online is located somewhere else, so your connection will see different latencies (ping) to different servers. Because of this, the biggest culprit when large changes in latency happen is a change in your network routing caused by your ISP that makes your connection take a longer route or hit a problematic node. Before we take a real close look at your network routing, I'd like you to work through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure your local network settings are configured properly for League.\n\nLet me know if this resolved your issue.","replies":[]}]}
