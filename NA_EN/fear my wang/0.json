The issue is that *there is no reason to start abusing or insulting someone in a recreational activity.* Accepting abuse isn't a sign of maturity, but being able to feel emotions without turning those emotions into an attack on someone else *is*. It's not that we're \"offended\" or \"hurt\" so much as it's clear that the person doing the insulting isn't respectful of his fellow players, and likely isn't playing the game for the right reasons.\n\nNo one is telling you you can't be angry, or frustrated, or upset.
