I tried my pc on csgo and it worked perfectly 0 game freezes 150 fps. But when i tried it in lol the game started freezing from the start. My resolution settings were 1920x1200 and all graphics set to the highest amount and i thought that was the problem for my freezing. But then  i tried it with lower resolution and all graphics settings to the lowest and it was the same thing. So please someone help me to enjoy this game :).","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-02T20:22:14.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a heads up, in case you are using a 4k monitor be aware that it may cause issues with League and you would need to reduce your resolution.  As a first time, it's super important to make sure all of your drivers are up to date when getting a new rig.  In addition to that, make sure you've gone through the wring of windows updates.  I suggest going through our [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide as well to tune up your pc.  \n\nOn a final note, if you have updated Windows already, then you may be having an issue with the [Xbox Game Bar ](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) that has been causing freezing for some players.  Disabling that can rid you of the freezing problem.\n\nHopefully, this will smooth things out for you!","replies":[{"poster":"vvlone","date":"2016-09-04T11:01:36.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the help bud, For monitor i use my ex- tv screen its kinda big what resolution would you preffer for me to play on?\n Anyways thanks for the help! :)","replies":[]}]}]}
