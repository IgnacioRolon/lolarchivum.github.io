I could easily see something like this becoming a cheap (or free) bit of flair you could add to your profile in place of, say, your favorite champion background or something. It's something I could see possibly adding to a small search interface in the client (click a profile option, get presented with a list of champion/League art to select from, and a place to type in a name of a champion/team to narrow it down further), and letting regional teams from events like the College Championships etc. actually create their own backgrounds (within a set of Riot guidelines) and get approval for, so that their fans could then find them in the client.","replies":[]}]}]}
