I don't know your age, but in the 90's a ban was laid down that stated characters in shows that aired during certain times of day and movies with ratings lower than PG-13 could not be shown smoking - because children are impressionable. This game is marketed to older teens and it's a different world now.\n\nIt's unlikely that anyone today is going to say \"I wanna smoke so I can be cool like Graves!\" but the OP is not completely wrong, either.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Storm Dragon","date":"2014-10-24T10:51:01.337+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He smoked a cigar in the New Dawn cinematic.
