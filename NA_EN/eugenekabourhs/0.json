It's best to leave it alone and let your network grab those files unless you're getting any errors.  Once it's all done, run through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to tune up any settings that might be slowing or degrading your connection to our patching servers.  Cancelling the update too early can delay your patch by scanning every game file for corruption!  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]}]}
