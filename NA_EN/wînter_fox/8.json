Especially if they don't add an indicator, as it's considered to be 'perma' atm, and this isn't even true at all and it needs an indicator already, especially for {{champion:55}}. You jump in and EWQEE, this is normally within 5 seconds, and so if you don't purposefully delay the combo in the first place, your sudden impact falls off and you don't reproc it and you're left with Shunpo/w/Q on cooldown anyway. It's a challenge to even keep it running, and is not ideal for your Shunpos to be spaced 5s apart. You can very easily in live now Shunpo, and try to engage 4s later(improperly timed) and miss the proc all together for the rest of your combo(WGR).\n\nI would rather prefer a rune that just gives 5pen(adaptive, why not), at all times.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"0 Hogapu","date":"2018-03-23T13:46:42.650+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently, the rune lasts longer than it has CD. \nAs a Kat main myself, I just notice that this rune is doing almost 3/4 of the electrocute damage in every game, and I think this is defnitely too strong.\nHowever making it have a 25s cooldown would make it hard for Kat to use it purposefully given how often she has to use E in lane, and not especially to trade with her laner. \nHaving an indicator would help that's for sure, but 25s is way too long anyways.\nThey could also make it proc whenever someoen dashes AND hits an ennemy champion, to make it procable on demand instead of randomly losing the buff.","replies":[{"poster":"Kats Pajamas","date":"2018-03-23T21:45:26.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Azorlebleu,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=GVfbTlnl,comment-id=00000000000000010000,timestamp=2018-03-23T13:46:42.650+0000)\n>\n> Currently, the rune lasts longer than it has CD. \n> As a Kat main myself, I just notice that this rune is doing almost 3/4 of the electrocute damage in every game, and I think this is defnitely too strong.\n> However making it have a 25s cooldown would make it hard for Kat to use it purposefully given how often she has to use E in lane, and not especially to trade with her laner. \n> Having an indicator would help that&#x27;s for sure, but 25s is way too long anyways.\n> They could also make it proc whenever someoen dashes AND hits an ennemy champion, to make it procable on demand instead of randomly losing the buff.\n\nPersonally, the rune shouldn't have a cooldown at all, until it has an indicator.\n\nEven with it's 4s live cooldown, you miss using it obliviously all the time, and with a 25s cooldown, it's rather important if you know if it's up or not. This change absolutely makes it useless until 1. Indicator or 2. not happen. Katarina combo does not synergize in the slightest with these values on live. You just have the closest refreshed dash to them, thus high power. For example Fiddlesticks doesn't even consider this change for his Ultimates. Nerfing the CDR of Sudden pretty much effects Katarina more than even new Irelia and shes at 50% winrate.  25s is insanely long, karthus flash for R is more important than katarina shunpo with that much cooldown.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fairyfleur","date":"2018-03-22T21:28:30.148+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's really good on {{champion:28}} too, although, the added cd probably won't hurt that much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daunt","date":"2018-03-23T00:11:15.528+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Only Katarina takes it regularly and she was already nerfed a bunch of times for synergizing well with the new runes.","replies":[{"poster":"Unvictus","date":"2018-03-23T12:17:01.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yet they chose to nerf her and not the runes, and now they are nerfing the runes too.

Any halfway decent player will be able to harrass and zone out Kat during the laning phase and she’s forced to opt into resolve just to come out even from laning. Her dagger damage late game got nerfed so her already bad late game got worse. Due to her now weaker early she can’t perform mid game when she should shine and then late game is hopeless.

You seem to overuse the word \"gutted\" without actually knowing what it means. 15 less damage on Shunpo doesn't \"gut\" her and the nerf to her CD was justified.\nAny decent Katarina will also know how to survive the lane and look for openings not just in lane but on the map as well. Her lane did not change in the past few patches, the champions that people play in mid did. And most of the time i don't even run Resolve unless the matchup is really nasty. Inspiration gives me nice utility which i can transfer later in mid game. She was already overkilling people late game so realistically she didn't really lose any damage with the last nerf.\nAlso, let me correct your statement: Due to her not being a god tier pick anymore we Platinum and below players are unable to pilot the champion so it must be weak.\nShe IS weaker and i do agree to that but not to the length you people do. The thing is that currently champions that screw Katarina over early are picked so there's not a problem with the champion itself. Even so, she's still able to transition into her mid game powerspike and carry games if YOU are able to pull her off. Katarina will never really be in a bad spot, especially under D3 where she's always gonna be considered broken.\n\nAh the Katarina community. As soon as their champ gets touched or isn't S tier they start crying. Even though their incompetence is the only reason for them not climbing.

That was by far her best secondary tree. Triumph and Coup de Grace synergize so well with her kit.

I said “they gutted the damage” not “the change gutted her”. Don’t put words in my mouth kid.

Pretty much only Lux and Xerath really outrange her, of which the latter is also broken atm, I play him pretty often and he is good to rival Anivia.\n\nYou dont need to outrange her, all you need is to be able to cancel her ultimate and/or dodge her Q, which is why i like both Ahri and Syndra into that matchup,.,,,,at least when Syndra isnt bugged. \n\nProblems killing her? In lane its really easy for most of them, the reason they lose eventually is that it's hard to do in teamfights and her DPS is top class thanks to liandry buffs. \n\nWell that and she actually scales well, but she is a zone control mage so by default, avoid playing into her hands and she cant really do much. \n\n\n> Like you said, the only way to actually do anything against her is to outrotate her early and bring your team ahead before she scales.\n\nThats the price she pays for safety though, being unable to really impact the map, and you can beat her in lane if you play right or have the right cards on hand. \n\n\n> But if that doesn&#x27;t work, gg. And even then finding moments to rotate against her waveclear isn&#x27;t an easy thing to do in the first place.\n\nSplit your team then, she cant be everywhere, nor can she actually do much if she gets flanked.....she is actually one of the weakest mages when it comes to responding to an attack when she has already dropped her ulti elsewhere. \n\n> Also, her winrate is somewhere around 53-54% for months now across mid and high elo, which definitely isn&#x27;t fine for a mage. Idk where you got 51,5% from.\n\nEven OP.GG, which puts her at her highest being 52%, and looking at her winrate it has in fact been slowly sinking since patch 8,2, a patch in which she had rapidly risen, but her playrate hasnt ever been really high either so it's not a case of 40% pickrate and 52% winrate. \n\nWith only 6-7% playrate it's not really unreasonable to have 52% winrate on a fairly easy but reliable champ. \n\n> In theory getting out her egg and killing her sound easy, but in reality that isn&#x27;t so easy, at least not in SoloQ.\n\nIt is easy.........as long as you arent playing something thats weak early or lack the ability to really get ontop of her and finish her like say Lissandra. \n\n> To kill her you have to put in so much more work than to kill any other mage, and it feels like she doesn&#x27;t even pay anything for that, considering her scaling and damage.\n\nHer damage is as i mentioned, super conditional, she needs to land her Q, make you stand in her ultimate and she also needs to not be hit by CC.\n\nShe cant fight while moving, she cant handle mobilty or flankers and she cant handle range, she is also very slow so she struggles to reposition. \n\nI honestly think that the only reason she does well at this time is because of the changes to seraph and liandry being greatly beneficial for her.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dani El Pezglobo","date":"2018-03-22T23:21:17.585+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"its really hard kill anivia due u have to kill her 2 times, and lets be real midlaners doesnt have dps enough to kill her egg.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2018-03-22T20:38:23.188+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Who Fed Ru,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=GVfbTlnl,comment-id=000100010000,timestamp=2018-03-22T17:53:42.220+0000)\n>\n> if you ask me, half of these compensation buffs don&#x27;t even make up for the loss of basically half the damage on {{item:3147}}.\n> That item was pretty much deleted.\n> \n> I wonder why Duskblade had to be the first item to be nerfed.\n> Assassins definitely aren&#x27;t the class that&#x27;s causing only problems atm in the first place.\n> \n> Bot lane is still broken, Junglers can still gank every lane 10 times a minute without losing anything, {{champion:50}} is still in his overbuffed state, {{champion:19}} is still on his 55% wr, {{champion:40}} and {{champion:34}} are for some reason allowed to still be broken for months now, but better gut Duskblade first I guess.\n> \n> The only champ that actually was a problem was {{champion:121}}.\n> And I&#x27;m pretty sure it will take months for now until Riot actually starts fixing the real problems in this game.\n\nJanna and anivia arent even broken.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ValiantKiller","date":"2018-03-22T16:58:09.376+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Who Fed Ru,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=GVfbTlnl,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-03-22T16:43:04.113+0000)\n>\n> so Assassins get nerfed again because of something else abusing their stuff?\n> \n> honestly go fuck yourself Riot.\n\nAnd all they got to do, was just to lock this special items/runes to special type of champions but ofcourse let adc and mages run away with their power spike while assassin pay for {{champion:86}} ,{{champion:92}} , adc that use {{item:3147}} and abuse it power now we paying for champions that use sudden impact.\nYay.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2018-03-22T17:48:22.256+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Locking runes and items are kinda contrary to the entire idea of their creation and act of putting them out for everyone x)\n\n\nBy the way.....how are assassins paying for Garen and mages for Riven?
