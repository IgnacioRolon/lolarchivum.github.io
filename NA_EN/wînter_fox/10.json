I've already ruled out 90% of animes with the non-highschool restriction, but If you think of an anime in less than 5 seconds I've probably seen it. Before the trolls start swarming in I want to lay down some more restrictions:\n\n**I. No mainstream animes**\n\n* - If you're going to mention One Piece, Bleach, etc. you're probably a terrible human being.*\"Have you ever watched Dragon Ball Z, OP?\"* - really? this is like recommending water to someone who wants to try a new drink. \n\n**II. No Adult Swim animes**\n\n* - That means Cowboy Bebop, Stand Alone Complex, Samurai Champloo, Full Metal Alchemist, Wolf's Rain, Trigun, Kenshin, etc. Yes they're good. Yes I've seen them. Everyone has. Next!\n\nIII. **I've already seen these - watch them if you haven't**\n\n* - Welcome to the NHK, Gankutsuou, Death Note, Spice and Wolf, Fate/All of them, Maison Ikkoku, Love Hina, Steins;Gate, Darker than Black, Planetes, Monster\n\n**IV. Honey and Clover sucks**\n\n* - It was boring and I don't know why people recommend this\n\n\n\nDon't disappoint Riven, GD!","replies":[]}
