I could never get into Arma or it&#039;s mods like original DayZ and such. I see a lot of people playing H1Z1 King of the kill and it looks fun, never hear anything about the survival mode though. I have 7 days to die and I&#039;m not a huge fan of it either. Would you suggest KotK or any other survival game?","replies":[]}
