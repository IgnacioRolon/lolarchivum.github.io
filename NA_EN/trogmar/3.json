I'm talking maybe a few months after he was released Urgot. The one who truly transitioned from a monstrous early game carry in lane to a late game soul-crushing bruiser tank. There were few people who really appreciated just what you did with a champion like Urgot back then, but I knew that the correct way to play him was this: You chose one enemy and concentrated all your efforts on making their life miserable forever.\n\nEverything in terms of the feel of the champion that I enjoyed has been neutered since, so I no longer play him.\n\n\nIn the future when I can consistently play more often I plan to play a ton of {{champion:432}}  because I have never had more fun playing a champion than with him.

I made this account to teach a friend how to play the game. My friend is new and I find it appalling when newbie players have to match up against smurf players, but with me right beside him that would be hypocritical. So I purposely handicapped myself by picking the weakest role (support) and the weakest champion in that role (Taric) and then proceed to play the game with these handicaps. My carrying potential is very low but I can atleast even out the score enough that my friend had to learn to step up instead of me bailing him out all the time and he is a better player for it. We don't always win but my presence helps neutralize/diminish the smurf factor in the early stages of the game for him as well as gives him the opportunities to improve on his game play.
