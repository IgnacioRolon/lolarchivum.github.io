She's so disruptive to team fights and puts out really good damage. So I'd say her late game potential is amazing.\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to add that she reminds me a little bit of an AP version of Yasuo. Where Ryze you sorta park your ass and focus on single opponents, Taliyah has a really dynamic/organic battle style. You have to be comfortable fighting in the thick of a battle and move around to totally disrupt your opponents cohesiveness.","replies":[{"poster":"Trogmar","date":"2017-02-17T17:18:03.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mountain Warden,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HqiPJslm,comment-id=000500000000,timestamp=2017-02-17T16:46:22.386+0000)\n>\n> I haven&#x27;t seen too many good taliyahs, but once I saw one that was godlike.

His ult will allow for good catches similar to Taliyah, but he doesn't have the downfall being super team reliant. \nAs someone who has played a lot of Taliyah I play a playstyle that is to try and single out targets for my team to kill, and to roam like crazy to get either my top or bot rolling so we can win the game. She is an early to mid game champ, but falls off hard compared to her other mid counterparts. \nSeeing how you are going for a OTP the real question is finding a playstyle that you can enjoy. Like I said Ryze is easier to carry with but Taliyah, in my opinion, is far more fun and rewarding to play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unlucky47","date":"2017-02-16T20:49:59.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't listen to that missing kayo guy.
