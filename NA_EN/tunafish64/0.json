From what I remember I was the owner of this club but when I updated my client I was mysteriously kicked out of the club. None of my friends said that they did anything, and one was confused if she was the leader or not (since I was the leader to begin with and it must have switched leaders). I didn't care too much at the time up until today when I tried to create a new club. It said that to create the club I have to have played at least 1 game (which I most definitely have), and cannot be an owner of a club. My guess is while I am not part of a club, that client still believes that I am (hence \"glitch\"). If anyone knows how to fix, or can fix, this problem, it would be much appreciated!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Tunafish64","date":"2016-12-13T23:33:05.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay Cool!
