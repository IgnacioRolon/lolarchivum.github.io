Please exit the client and re-open it to try again.\" When I do that it says \"We have restored the installation to an older version of League of Legends. Now we'll try and patch it up to the latest version.\" Except nothing happens, I login and it's just the same problem over and over again. I have tried the full repair button for settings on the login screen and even uninstalling and reinstalling multiple times yet nothing has worked.","replies":[{"poster":"Junglerz Fault","date":"2017-06-06T18:17:17.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having this same problem now.

Grab our [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and run it using a **force repatch** first. If that still doesn't work, go ahead and run the tool with **reinstall and clean uninstall** and that should do the trick, albeit taking a bit longer.","replies":[{"poster":"KlNG P0TAT0","date":"2017-06-06T04:17:07.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thank you.
