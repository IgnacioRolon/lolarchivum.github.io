Very few have explored the Void, and those that do are not open to discussing what they discovered or have no interest in conversation at all; Malzahar and Kassadin being the former while the Voidborn are the latter. What we do know about the Void as a location is that it induces madness in human minds exposed to it, darkness is prevalent and natural according to Vel&#039;Koz, and that a number of varied, yet highly specialized, creatures inhabit it.\r\n\r\nHowever, while information on the Void is limited, data on those that call it home is more readily available, and it is the commonalities between them I wish to bring up.\r\n\r\nMost, perhaps with the exception of Rek&#039;Sai, Voidborn are capable of speech. It can be argued that Cho&#039;Gath, Vel&#039;Koz, Kha&#039;Zix, and Kog&#039;Maw are not actually speaking, and that the voices we hear in-game are simply there to provide a more familiar experience than the incoherent sounds of a monster. In spite this possibility, I firmly believe that Voidborn are capable of real speech, and by extension, capable of forming complex thoughts.\r\n\r\nIt may not seem like much, that these horrible monsters can speak, but this potential for communication in foreign tongues suggests that perhaps there is another language Voidborn are capable of communicating in, one humans may not be fully capable of comprehending. Perhaps it is a sophisticated combination of sounds, pheromones, and bioelectric pulses (Vel&#039;Koz and Rek&#039;Sai are capable of producing naturally occurring electricity). Whatever the case may be, if a language exists, someone or something came to define it.\r\n\r\nIf everything I have outlined is true, and it may not, then the potential for Void culture and society exists, as anyone will tell you, the easiest means of facilitating some semblance of common ground is through language.\r\n\r\nSo I ask, does some form of Void culture exist? Do the Voidborn possess a society that is, while incredibly alien, nonetheless a structured existence? If so, what do you think it is like? Perhaps there is some strange type of hierarchy or even aristocracy where superior Voidborn are granted social privileges that may include _eating_ their inferiors? Perhaps one Voidborn takes advantage of its malleable anatomy and treats its body as a living work of art. Maybe there are intricate hives in the Void with otherworldly architecture.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2015-05-22T02:08:50.516+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would assume that the Void's organisms exist in various sub-cultures determined by their individual species, with broods growing and developing independently. Some broods are specialized for a specific environment or specific activities while others are extremely broad in scope as to what they can do. If we look at two Voidborn; Rek'Sai and Kha'Zix, we see one is specialized for burrowing and digging, while one is capable of adapting to any potential environment. \n\nI'd say that the Void is sort of a primordial soup of development and alien growth that exists in constant flux, with species growing dominant in one area and then being supplanted by another species that evolves a way to take them out. \"Omnivorous\" voidborn like Kha'Zix exist as the prevention to stagnation in the evolution; if one species gets too dominant the highly adaptive species grow to combat it and even out the playing field again, allowing for other species to emerge.\n\nThen we have the Voidborn who are capable of speech, but intelligence isn't a binary measurement that only a being ability to speak determines. Kog'Maw of course is young so he could potentially grow smarter, but I feel like he won't, as his biology doesn't need him to be much smarter. Kha'Zix is similar; his thoughts are sharp, quick and to the point. Nothing inefficient, even in his mind. It's not what we'd say is \"smart\" but in reality Kha'Zix is highly intelligent in his own way. He doesn't actually need to be smarter, and being smarter actually defeats the point of his very existence.\n\nOn the other side though we have Cho'Gath and Vel'Koz who are probably the most intelligent of the five. Vel'Koz is intelligent, but he isn't that different to other voidborn like Kha;Zix and Kog'Maw; his smarts are simply to allow him to comprehend the nature of things he consumes. It is his purpose after all. Then we have Cho'Gath, who is clearly intelligent to the point of being malevolent and sinister, something we don't see in the others. Sure they all wanna ripe your face off in some manner but Cho'Gath isn't as simple as that. \n\nHe's careful and crafty, and I honestly think that's not in his species that's him growing outside of his means. He's not supposed to be like this by the nature of Voidborn; it's inefficient, unnecessary. But he has grown that way regardless. He has lived, survived and grown enough to evolve past other Voidborn and comprehend beyond simply knowing. He _understands_ things. he knows about emotions in humans, about how creatures behave and he knows how to torment people simply with words. \n\nOn the other side we have Rek'Sai, a creature who doesn't speak and while she has some intelligence, being capable of eliciting enough joy to actually laugh about things, she is primitive. I feel as though this is her personal adaptation to Shurima, in that as the dominant predator of the region, intelligence isn't required. The Ascended are scattered, Shurima's armies have long fallen, there's no competition for her. It's her world. She developed in areas that would allow her to maintain her status as apex predator, and lost abilities that were meaningless to such a being, including the ability to speak in a language understandable to humans. This is inherited by her children, and will likely persist until something forces the Xer'Sai as a species to adapt once again, but they haven't had to do that in god knows how long.\n\nOverall I'd say the Void is a place that doesn't so much have structure as it has an ecology that is smart enough to know what it's doing. The Voidbeasts that are the cream of the crop are supplanted by beings that grow specifically to counter them, while other species know to avoid such things. The entire Void exists in a state of organic change and species likely don't stay around in the same incarnation for very long. This changes when they come to Runeterra though, as the environments are more stagnant and development is slow. Some Voidborn are old and powerful, and as such are vastly different to the rest in terms of mentality and biology, but all in all I don't think there's a specific \"culture\" for the Void, merely an environment. A play ground for the development of monsters that can etch out a living within it.\n\nAlso as a final note, I personally think all the Voidborn names we have are Shuriman words. I personally doubt the Void has its own intelligible language. They may screech and bellow and can respond well to visual stimuli but it probably varies between species or something to that effect.","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2015-05-22T06:39:06.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just a small thing but I don't think Vel'Koz is that different from how Cho has gone beyond what is required of his species in that when he does his taunt, he creates a sort of monitor that displays symbols, this suggests that he has some kind of language or numerical system made by either him or some culture of the void or perhaps just his species.

The world could vanish in an instant, and not only would mankind be helpless to stop it, but the entities involved with its destruction would not even notice.\n\nWhen I think of something Lovecraftian, I think of this:http://25.media.tumblr.com/0118a0129ac430e1f1914ea9dbfd5479/tumblr_mvrny2MIbD1rni5lso1_500.gif\n\nWhat we can perceive is so limited by out state of existence that what can be seen may only be the barest fraction of a monster's form, the dimensional equivalent of it dipping the tip of a metaphorical finger into our reality.

It cannot exist in our world, it should not exist in our universe, but somehow it defies all rational laws that we understand, which further implicates our understanding of the universe is flawed, and exists in spite of them.\n\nLovecraftian works make man small, inconsequential, and completely ineffectual. While the Void does make Runeterra feel small, it does not do so in the same way.\n\nChampions from the Void are flesh and blood, they operate on a biological foundation that we can _mostly_ understand. Most importantly, they can be overcome, and not just with armies, sophisticated magic, or advance technology, but on an individual basis.\n\nPerhaps there is more to the Void than we are currently aware of that would fulfill the criteria of a Lovecraftian setting and the Voidborn are the rough equivalent of parasites or bacteria, a not too complex organism that happens to exist in the shadow of much more significant beings.\n\nAs it stand now, the Void merely has Lovecraftian vibes.

Consuming. Whether it consumes flesh, or knowledge, it wants to eat, to devour, to take over, to obtain. However, what each creature wants, and why, is very different. Cho'Gath eats so that he can grow stronger. Kog'Maw eats to 'meet' and 'experience' the world around it. Kha'Zix eats to evolve, to improve itself. Vel'Koz 'eats' to obtain knowledge, to learn, to expand its knowledge. Rek'Sai is the only one not fully explained, mostly because anyone that tried to ask about it was promptly eaten.\n\nHowever, the Void is clearly not a land of mindless destruction, it does not consume without reason, it does not destroy, or ravage without purpose. It is not a mindless place. Malzahar is perfect proof of this. The Void has touched him, granted him power, and essentially uses him as its servant in Valoran, and Malzahar himself offers the Touch of the Void to others, gaining a following, granting power. The Void has goals, it has plans, and it is not merely some stupid, mindless force. The Void watches Valoran, sends through creatures, tests the world, and, if Void Fizz is actually pseudo-cannon(As in it is a possible outcome for Fizz) it may want to take over, and control, or change the creatures of Valoran.\n\nThe thing that intrigues me most about the Void is thinking about its potential 'government' or 'society', is it ruled by an all-powerful Lord, or King that directs them? Are they commanded by a central hive mind? Do they have a council, or group? Are they an army of pure individuals working together merely because it furthers their own goals? Do they have a monarch? A Canceller? A President? Is there a Void Obama? Do they have homes, or belongings? Do they CARE about homes or belongings? Do they have any sense, or care for anything other than their particular 'Taste' for what they consume?\n\nThe Void is so intriguing, because there is so many possibilities, it's such an alien world, an alien society, a place that we cannot even think to understand, and I REALLY hope that stays there, I don't WANT to fully understand the Void's goals, desires, society, inner workings. If I understand it, that ruins it. It should be impossible to truly understand, otherwise what makes it any different from Zaun, or Demacia, or Bilgewater?

I like to imagine that guiding intelligences behind the Voidborn are what you might call more real than real.  When the Voidborn raze a world to its foundation for their own ineffable reasons it isn't out of malice, far from it. Those in charge simply don't care about all those lives being lost. Not because they're bigger and more powerful and more ancient (they are certainly all those things), but because from their perspective these little material folks aren't real. It would be like shedding a tear over the countless virtual lives lost after several games of Pandemic. In that vision, beings from the Void can only interact with Runeterra via avatars (the Voidborn) because they can't exist in a fantasy world any more than you or I can.\n\nWhich is, of course, why we interact with each other via Champions.\n\nIt makes a nice little bit of cognitive dissonance, don't you think?  That we might have more in common with the eldritch abominations?\n\nSo the Voidborn are avatars.  The Voidlings would be, what?  Simple self-running scripts?  Koggy's 'Daddy' would thus be whatever awful thing he's an extension of.  A fractal fragment of a horror too vast for Runeterra to contain.  As for their culture, who's to say?

It's hard to say.

Not as something the people of Runeterra could learn, but something so drastically alien that any attempt to understand or learn about it would be wholly futile. As a whole, the Void and its creatures are rough yet- in some ways- organized, ex: the strong lead, and in theory that could be any creature of the Void, but its generally  a pretty consistent leadership. I would imagine that in this leadership, there's what we would think of as greed or- presuming the creatures of the Void existed in ancient Shurima- a desire for vengeance. They want everything there is, everything there ever will be, and ultimately the greatest enemy of this structure is itself- for example while Rek'sai is a Voidborn like Vel'koz, Cho'gath, Kha'zix and Kog'maw, it's a clear stretch to call her their ally. I would imagine species like the Xer'sai are reasonably common, actually, and in a sense they are probably the most predictable force in Void culture precisely because you can trust them _not_ to cooperate for some greater goal.\n\nIt would also be pretty reasonable to assume that, while we may consider Voidborn like Rek'sai or Kog'maw to be unintelligent, it's entirely possible that Rek'sai (and after some growing, Kog'maw) would be considered brilliant by Voidborn standards. While Vel'koz and Cho'gath surely show more intelligence in the sense that _we_ would measure it, the Void probably has an entirely different standard defined partially or entirely by success or efficiency. In that regard the absolutely gargantuan Rek'sai and efficient Kog'maw could very well be considered geniuses in the sense that we would consider a painter or writer a genius despite their intelligence being of a drastically different form than, say, a physicist.\n\nI think in order to define what Void culture_ is_, we would be better served by defining what it _is not_. At all but the highest levels, it probably isn't rigid, but the highest level of it has probably been rather well established and would consist of creatures like Rek'sai and possibly Cho'gath. It isn't something that would make sense to the people of Runeterra barring a few like Zilean, Kassadin and Malzahar- and the last is probably debatable given his insanity. We can also probably assume it isn't something that can be reasoned with as their goals are fundamentally opposed with Runeterran existence. It might be helpful to think of the greater creatures (Rek'sai the only one we're aware of at the moment) as something close to gods, the pinnacle of existence as far as the Void is concerned, with the rest being akin to believers in this case. Put simply: while Rek'sai is simply a larger, stronger Xer'sai, her strength puts her so far above her peers they might as well be ants in comparison. And likely, the Void is filled with countless more examples of this- there is almost certainly a larger, more powerful eyeball monster than Vel'koz, with the only possible exceptions being creatures like Kha'zix whose strength is adaptation and change likely actually being somewhat more vulnerable as they get older and inevitably more rigid in their development.\n\nI certainly think there's more going on than just a bunch of mindless beasts who want to destroy everything for the evulz, but given what little we have to work with, it's impossible to say exactly what's up with the Void beyond it having some sort of organized hierarchy and wanting to- to the extent it concerns most people, anyway- raze Runeterra.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lysdexic1","date":"2015-05-22T05:33:41.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To me, i think we only have a glimpse of one aspect of the void: the warriors.

Where Shadow Isles embodies life and death, Void is feral nature evolved.\n\nWe need Envy and Sloth based champions tho!\n\nAs far as Kassadin and Malzahar go, they're humans. How they're affected by the void would largely differ based on their personalities and exposure to the void itself.\n\nMy five cents on that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alljoy","date":"2015-05-22T02:39:16.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  Perhaps one Voidborn takes advantage of its malleable anatomy and treats its body as a living work of art. Maybe there are intricate hives in the Void with otherworldly architecture.\n\n\nOr maybe said hives *are* voidborns themselves that exist in that realm.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tesla Effect","date":"2015-05-22T02:31:08.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"More like Darwinian culture, survival of the fittest.","replies":[]}]}
