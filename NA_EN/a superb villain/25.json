To me it's almost as if when things like this happen, it's like everything unites for a common goal; people aren't cowering, praying to their gods and guardians, they're fighting alongside those gods and guardians!\n\nAlso adds an interesting vibe for me to the Noxus - Ionia conflict: \"You brought mercenaries and technology from Zaun? Well we brought guardians of natural and interstellar beings!\" Perhaps this is how they plan to resolve the conflict completely since Noxus hasn't been booted out yet, I mean what better way to send a message to your enemies than literally having your gods come around and slap them in the face?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Gunpoint","date":"2015-02-24T21:21:03.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, Jax is Gragas's drinking buddy.
