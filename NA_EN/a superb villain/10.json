The Q was buffed to give the 5 AP on Assists as well as kills, so say your jungle is helping you, but you've gone oom because early mana costs OP and your jungler takes the kill like he should. Well, normally you'd go B and cry as you missed out on 5 AP. Now you go B and look at that free 5 Q farm you just got by pressing E. His W also lost .25s off of it's drop time since its countdown now starts when clicked rather than at the end of the cast time. His W was given reliability and his Q now gives AP a lot more often.\n\nI should point out before his W dropped in 1.45s and his base stun lasted for 1.5s. Usually it took you about .25s-.5s to pressing W since you're not always in range for the W when they hit the wall. Well, now with 2 levels into your E, you can then level your W second properly and abuse the large base damage it does rather than having to put 3+ points into it so the enemy would be stunned long enough to actually take the W's damage. Considering his W has a 300 damage base (Being nerfed next patch) can now be achieved at level 14 rather than at max level on top of getting 5 AP for every assist after your max level Q... To put it simply, Veigar got a lot of reliability added to his abilities after his Q was turned into a skill shot and his E was given a delay. He's not got 'about' the same amount of reliability he had before, which was what made him strong before. Now he's just gotta be tuned down oh so slightly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MAN OF INTELLECT","date":"2015-10-25T23:03:50.307+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"My, how big he's grown!","replies":[{"poster":"Solis Deus","date":"2015-10-25T23:33:18.351+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"that's what she said.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"juice loosener","date":"2015-10-27T05:28:32.504+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"that's because everyone was short-sighted :D","replies":[{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2015-10-27T12:59:44.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ಠ╭╮ರೃ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-10-26T01:34:10.395+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So ready for that to be a skin next February.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FistOfSharkiesha","date":"2015-10-26T01:13:27.622+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"He has about 1 patch in the limelight.
