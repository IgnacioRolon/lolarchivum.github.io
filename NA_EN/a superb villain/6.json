I just really like Viktor and wanted to give him a little backstory that shows before the machine, he was human, just as anyone else. Any and all criticisms are welcome. Thank you._ {{champion:112}} \n\n---\n\nHe&rsquo;s never known hunger. For as long as he remembers, there has always been a plate at the table for him, even if it was the only one there. He never hesitates to climb up a chair taller than him. There is nothing he cannot overcome, no challenge unsurpassed, and it is the gentle words of encouragement from Mama that help him reach incredible heights. Other children tell him the factory dumpster isn&rsquo;t really that tall, but he still feels like a giant when they twist their necks to look up at him. And he never, ever, starts eating until Mama and Papa have taken their seats at the table. Papa says a young man must show consideration for his peers and wait until everyone is ready. Mama says it works out best when everyone begins and ends their meal together so they can all speak freely.\n\nSo when Papa isn&rsquo;t ready one evening, he sits and waits.\n\nMama watches him from the counter and asks, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you hungry, Vitya?&rdquo;\n\nHe scrapes a heel against the metal leg of his chair. He tries not to stare at his plate and ignores the growling of his rebellious stomach. &ldquo;Where is Papa?&rdquo;\n\nHis mother puts down the knife in her hands and wipes them on her apron. &ldquo;Papa is it at work. He&rsquo;ll be coming home later now.&rdquo; Her hand slips over his and she squeezes. &ldquo;Go on. Eat.&rdquo;\n\nSo he does, but the table is quiet and his meal sits uncomfortably at the bottom of his stomach when he&rsquo;s done.\n\nHe tells himself he doesn&rsquo;t mind, that he understands why Papa stays at the foundry well after lamps light up the streets. He tries to convince himself he doesn&rsquo;t mind hearing the door click shut in the early morning hours, or that he stops seeing Papa at breakfast as well. His father only finds time for him on the too few days he&rsquo;s not needed at work. He wants to play outside like they did before, clambering over asphalt as his Papa growls behind the metal bars of a jungle gym. But now his father can barely make it to the door without yawning, so they spend his free time in their small living room. There is a book in his hand from the library and his father snores loudly, but Viktor doesn&rsquo;t mind reading on his lap. And that he readily believes.\n\nSometimes he wanders down the winding streets of Zaun when the school day ends and his feet carry him to the Likhachov foundry where his father works. The windows are too high to look through, but he sees enough as sparks fly just over the rim. Through the brick walls he can hear the groan of metal and whir of machines, feel the steady thrum of a living engine that produces great metal beams with a belch of smoke and fire.\n\nHe&rsquo;s seven years old when men in large, white coats knock on their door.\n\nMama drops the screwdriver in her hand and stumbles away from the radiator sputtering against the wall. The way she fiddles with her faded apron as her fingers make awkward spasms causes him to chew lightly at his lower lip. His mother looks from the door, then to him, then back to the door. He does not argue when she tells him to go outside, that he can finish his homework later. Her hands are shaking as he is guided by the shoulders out the back. Mama chokes when a second series of knocks roll through the house. He walks around the block with little else to do, making a point to avoid his own front door. He waits for the streetlamps to turn on before making a slow return.\n\nMama is waiting in the kitchen when he makes it back home. Her breaths are short and shallow, eyes glassy and red. She sniffs loudly as he inches closer. Warm, strong, safe arms slip around him and he&rsquo;s pulled into her lap. Mama&rsquo;s mouth opens but nothing comes out. She tries several times, forcing out quiet squeaks and not much else. Viktor does his best to wrap both of his arms around her waist. Mama holds him tighter. He notices for the first time she is holding a wrinkled slip of paper when it scrapes his ear. He doesn&rsquo;t ask what it is, there&rsquo;s no need; the way her white knuckles tremble around it tells him its bad and that is all he wants to know.\n\nHis father never comes home.\n\nSchool progresses quickly and his room becomes a mess of motors, circuit boards, and batteries. Wires form a complex web across his floor that pulse like veins whenever he adjusts his desk lamp. Studies of various anatomical parts hang from every wall; arms, legs, organs, and bones create a puzzle of flesh. It&rsquo;s never quiet anymore. There is always something clicking, humming, whirring, and buzzing in the privacy of his room. Viktor makes a world of living metal to fill the silence. It&rsquo;s nothing like the foundry with its titanic pulse and sweltering breath, but it&rsquo;s as close as he can get, and that&rsquo;s enough.\n\nHis mother starts working at a local office, &ldquo;savings for a rainy day,&rdquo; she says. She leaves before he gets up for school and returns just before dinner. Viktor makes sure their meal is ready by the time she arrives. They wash the dishes together every evening, discussing their day as bubbles pop in the sink.\n\nOne night as the last plate is placed in the drying rack he stares at the faucet and says, &ldquo;I miss Papa.&rdquo;\n\nThe water continues to run as neither speaks. With one hand his mother shuts it off and with the other she pulls him close. Quietly, to hide the strain in her voice, she says, &ldquo;I do too.&rdquo;\n\nAt fifteen he graduates. A world of opportunity stretches before him and he can hardly imagine where he might end up. Dolshmein College has an attractive array of robotics courses, but the labs at Zaun Metropolitan offer the cutting edge in emerging techmaturgy. With the right scholarships, and perhaps a loan or two, he could even apply to the Rochester Academy of Piltover. Viktor&rsquo;s still puzzling over the most efficient course of action when his mother calls him to the kitchen.\n\nThe room feels so much smaller when he steps through the doorway. The wallpaper has lost much of its color and the tile has been rubbed down to a dull mockery of its once pristine sheen. His mother sits at the little table they shared for so many years, a black lunch pail held in both hands.\n\nIt&rsquo;s his fathers.\n\nShe pushes it towards him with a smile on her face, eyes filled to the brim with tears. Reverently, he opens the lid to discover a thick roll of banknotes wrapped together. It may not see him through the end of his education, but it is more than enough for a promising start. He can barely speak past the tightness in his throat, but his mother speaks for him.\n\n&ldquo;For a rainy day, Vitya.&rdquo;\n\nThey laugh as he scrambles around the table to wrap her in an unsteady hug, the lunch pail held tight beneath one arm. She whispers words of encouragement into his ear just as she always has, and Viktor believes he can change the world.\n\nHe&rsquo;s twenty-two and on his way to present an automated intelligence at the Metropolitan when a malfunctioning carriage throws him across the street.\n\nWith the best medical care he can afford recovery lasts three weeks, but restoring his leg is well beyond the limits of his meager wealth. The first steps are painful and he can barely manage to shuffle around but Mama squeezes his hand and he tries again. With days of practice he learns to anticipate the fluctuations of his unreliable knee. The hospital offers him a cane nonetheless. Viktor nearly matches his former speed with the rod&rsquo;s assistance, though his gait has become a terribly awkward hobble.\n\nEventually the fire in his leg fades to a dull ache that is content to occasionally reveal itself after a long day or restless night, but the traitorous knee keeps him from ever letting go of his cane.\n\nListening to the whir of an artificial limb turning the crank of a projector, he stares at diagrams penned from a previous study. The light stutters in the darkness of his room and fails before the metal arm quickly resumes cranking the projector. He wants to walk as he once did, not out of any vanity, but to simply prove he can. What good did studying the human body do if it only helped him create synthetic replicas? There was a connection between natural and artificial, he only had to look.\n\nThe first brace is clumsy. It weighs him down and causes his leg to ache after an hour of walking. The second moves with a natural grace but can barely hold him up. Viktor tears through designs and tests prototypes with wild abandon. Many are filed away as serviceable reminders of failure while some find their way into new iterations. Each test brings him one step closer to taking a literal one free of painful limitations. When he straps the final design on, Viktor knows he has found his solution.\n\nHe&rsquo;s thirty-four when the city requests his expertise in creating a line of waste-disposal automatons.\n\nHe&rsquo;s thirty-six when it&rsquo;s decided he&rsquo;s no longer needed.\n\nThey lied to him. They gave him praise for his contributions to the most promising collaboration organized by Zaun. But when the mind he had so carefully constructed proved to be much, much more than merely intelligent, Viktor was abandoned. Worse, he had been denied recognition for his efforts while others claimed his work as their own. Newsreels proudly proclaimed the birth of Runeterra&rsquo;s first sentient construct of techmaturgy.\n\nThe hole in his heart opened twenty-nine years ago yawns cavernously wide, and Viktor feels hollow. He had been cheated, abused for reasons he couldn&rsquo;t hope to explain, and unceremoniously dumped back where he had been found.\n\nIn the confines of the new apartment he had moved himself and his mother, the incessant chatter of machines becomes deafening. The metal click, click, clicks burrow into his skull like mechanical maggots, squirming through his thoughts. Who could he trust if fellow man took from him just as easily as the world did? It wasn&rsquo;t right, wasn&rsquo;t fair. He had worked for years developing the mind now guiding the steps of a certain steam golem. They left him with nothing.\n\nHe needed clarity of mind, and only work brought him the peace he so desperately desired. Days grow into weeks within the walls of his modest laboratory, but steady productivity lightens his spirits, helps him forget the sting of betrayal.\nLittle more than a month rolls by when the Headsman&rsquo;s Pride is paraded before flashing cameras.\n\nHe hardly believes his eyes as designs he knows by heart clank together in some hideous perversion of their true intent. It isn&rsquo;t possible; he refuses to accept the possibility of such unscrupulous deception. Viktor pores through countless folders holding documents from every previous experiment, but the folder he is searching for in particular holds no promises.\n\nIn fact, it&rsquo;s quite empty.\n\nHis eyes close on the laboratory and when he opens them he&rsquo;s greeted by a scrap yard. His hands are trembling as small cuts leak blood onto the floor. His brace is in shambles, the metal twisted like broken fingers. There is an ache in his chest and the harder he tries to deny its existence the more insistent it becomes.\n\nHe hates the College of Techmaturgy.\n\nHe hates Stanwick Pididly.\n\nMost of all, he hates himself.\n\nHe&rsquo;s weak for trusting them, is weak for letting their betrayal debilitate him.\n\nNo more.\n\nHe is weak, but weakness can be cured. Through iron and electricity, he could shed the faults of his birth, become more than he ever dreamed. And if the world wanted to take anything from him it would first need to pry it from his cold, metal hands.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-07-19T16:06:42.800+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like it!\n\nIt implies a few things that could perhaps be gone into with more detail, but I suspect that was intentional.

His work in conjunction with fellow students is just another project, he didn't expect anything amazing out of it. So when the work is prematurely shut down, declared a success, and not a word is said to him, he's confused. Everything spun wildly out of his control before Viktor could act.\n\n\n> I can understand the humanizing element to the introduction - the loss of his father seems like it should be a fairly motivating element - but that doesn't seem to loop back around.  Was the Likhachov foundry somehow connected to Stanwick?  Does he blame anyone for his father's death, because it seems it didn't spur him to be more like (or less like) his father in any respect.\n\nI think I struggled to make the connection Viktor had with the foundry, and by extension machines, through his father. That is why he doesn't finger any blame, he doesn't demand justice because he knows it was an accident; machines aren't malicious. It does motivate him, as Viktor goes on to invest much of his time observing and creating machines, all of which are described organically because that is how Viktor wishes to see them, and why he draws so heavily from the human body for inspiration. He does not need to make a metal arm to work the projector, but does so because he wants to.\n\nEmulating the factory, which to him is this fantasy of a \"living engine\" is his primary motivation, is also a means of being closer to his father. It is familiar, nostalgic in a way, since the majority of his childhood memory revolves around his father working and the effect it had on home.\n\n\n> Lastly, I'd have liked to know what happened to his mother.  If they share an apartment, and he destroyed the room in a fit of rage, was his mother still in the picture?  I don't suggest you have him accidentally kill her (too cliche, even for us, maybe ;)) but after the (very emotional) moment of paying for some of his education, she seems to be a non-element.\n\nHis mother is very much alright, though by that point of the story she is really beginning to feel her age; she is 51 about the time of Blitzcrank's creation. I can't imagine a lifetime within Zaun lasts very long, especially if you perform manual labor. He moved them into a new apartment because at that part of his life Viktor was successfully providing enough for both of them to live, and he recognizes just how much his mother did for him.\n\nI remember reading in Viktor's lore he entered a depression first, then locked himself away in his personal laboratory, and thought it would make sense if he moped at home before trying to overcome his disappointment in the lab. When the news hits that Urgot has been revived, and with designs swiped from his desk, he suffers a breakdown and destroys his lab. I tried to imply Viktor has been bottling up his emotions by never protesting his father working overtime, never crying after the unexpected death, the accident that broke his leg, or even being snipped from the research team, and all of that emotional baggage spilled out in a massive temper tantrum. When he sees years of work in ruins, even self-inflicted harm, Viktor decides that instead of dealing with his emotions, he would rather get rid of them, and that is a flaw I wanted to emphasize: he is non-confrontational.\n\nI never thought to kill her, and never would; too many champions are conveniently orphans or have parents that simply are not mentioned, and to have Viktor, perhaps the most inhuman human in the League roster not only interacting with her regularly, but actually providing for her, strikes me as a pleasant twist. If I ever continue writing this little headcanon his mother would play a very significant part. No matter how much he changes, Viktor will always be her little boy, and that piece of humanity is something he simply cannot deny. If anyone is to pull more human elements from him, it would be her.\n\nFinal note: originally his mother would have also been met with an accident that took her leg, and Viktor would create his first successful prosthetic for her, but it felt much too coincidental. I meant for it to provide a connection between Viktor, his family, and his current goals. His father prompted an interest in machines, his mother nurtured a desire to better the world, and that is why Viktor believes his inventions are for the betterment of mankind.\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Bioluminescence,realm=NA,application-id=2XjzURgc,discussion-id=PpLl6s6M,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-07-19T16:06:42.800+0000)\n> I am glad you wrote it - even if you're not sure why you did.\n\nAnd thank you very much!

However, I would like to say that even though Viktor worked primarily with techmaturgy, there is nothing that states he refrains from investigating other fields of science. Also, I feel the rarity of electricity in Runeterra is no longer so significant as it once was, as the most recent glimpses into Zaun via Ekko seem to imply that utilizing electricity, even if it is not the sole source of power, is more common than previously thought.\n\nStill, I made a mistake mixing hextech with electricty when no such precedent exists.

Facing that fact in someone he would never willingly ignore ensures some measure of humanity is retained no matter how much he attempts to remove.\n\nAnother detail I interpreted, and you have noted, is how Viktor never confronts his problems. He never confronts Pididily, he never responds in kind to Jayce's assault. Instead of dealing with his emotions he strips them away, or at least tries to. Every character needs flaws, and I like to believe avoidance is Viktor's most significant vice.\n\n\n>Viktor strikes me as a character who isn't bad - not by a longshot.\n> \n> ...But he could *turn* bad.

While Viktor's efforts are difficult to understand from the perspective of Runeterra's general population, most of his experiments are done in the name of improvement. Viktor, like the transhumanism he embodies, is in an intermediate state; where he goes from the current point in time is largely unknown.\n\n\n> What if what remained of his family were threatened?

His goal in the lab was to reforge himself into a greater being, and he was in part successful; all but the strongest emotional responses are suppressed. The only way I see Viktor going bad, so to speak, is if he pursues his Glorious Evolution to its most extreme end, where his inventions cause more harm to humanity than good.\n\n\n> In either case - my baseless take on everything aside, I really liked reading this.
