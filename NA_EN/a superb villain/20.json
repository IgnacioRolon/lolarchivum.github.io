It also takes skill to identify what IS good in a current meta which as stated above will primarily be assassins vs adcs for preseason by the looks of things. We did not pull that statement out of our ass but by inferring that adcs will be strong and multi-laned due to buffs and item changes and that Assassins will be needed to counter the ADCs. If you want to show off your 200k mastery point Sion or whatever for the sake of your mad skillz in a meta full of ADCs that will literally shred through your like you were made of paper mache (the irony is palpable) then you can go right ahead and lose because you are narrow-minded.\n\nYou make it sound like playing \"meta\" champions will not take any skill and that if I pick one I will automatically win. That is simply not the case since most of them do take a few brain cells or games under your belt to play well. Yasuo for one will be very strong in the preseason but you cannot expect a first time Yas to do well because he has a rather high skill cap to be able to carry the game all on his own. \n\n\"Change is good.\" - {{champion:121}} \n\"It's time for a true display of skill!\" - {{champion:81}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"D2Vincent","date":"2015-11-03T03:35:27.742+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meanwhile in the land of immobile mages...\n\n\"well wtf are we gonna do...\"\n\n(I'm a Karthus main and I find the preseason changes a little offensive...)","replies":[{"poster":"NightOfLight","date":"2015-11-03T05:42:27.317+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"well jungle is gonna be easier so you can jungle karthas then ult for free kills and farm like a mad man.","replies":[{"poster":"Anidan","date":"2015-11-03T05:57:11.588+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I heard some of these changes will be good for AD Malz, too. \n\nTheir part-time jobs are starting to look a little better, at least.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Gunpoint","date":"2015-11-02T23:08:25.190+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lonichiwa,realm=EUW,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=vNqac04O,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-11-02T21:27:53.306+0000)\n>\n> Wanna hear something funny?

This game is, in the grand scheme of things, a very big game of rock paper scissors with like 5 different options instead of 3 which all cycle back to each other. The only problem with the current iteration of League's rock-paper-scissors is that it is Tank<Marksman<Assassin<Fighter<Marksman/Control Mage<Assassin<FIghter<Marksman/Control Mage<etc.\n\nNotice anything strange? Tanks are nowhere to be found because Riot has currently made them sub-optimal to bring when compared to a Juggernaut that is arguably just as bulky but packs a lot more damage for the sacrifice of CC (To an extent since Death is arguably the hardest form of CC since it stuns you for 30+ seconds AND teleports you to the fountain. This is only surpassed by the duration of Morgana Binding where she disconnects you from the game entirely).
