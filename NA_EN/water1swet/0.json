I play Mid the most and am now getting into Jungle, and my main is Veigar. Love him so much that I have him Mastery 6 already.\nI do good against a lot of the champs I come across.\n\nBut with Yasuo... RIP. It feels like I can't do anything against even a decent Yasuo. I don't know how to play against him. He is so much stronger early game, and I feel useless against him no matter what I do. I try to stay around tower, let him aggro and farm minions with my Q, but as soon as I leave tower I'm deleted. Im not a bad player with Veigar, either (Atleast I would say... less than a month and already Mastery 6 is pretty good I think), but Yasuo is just the bane of my existence.\n\nSo, Veigarers, I have some questions to hopefully be better in the next fight against him (and i'm not banning him, I'm permabanning Katarina kappa)\n\n1. How do you guys play against him early game / laning phase? I know how to stack but it feels impossible against him, especially against an aggresive Yasuo. \n\n2. What items do you guys buy to counter him? \n\n My usual build in all games is start dorans ring and 2 potions, then go into Lost Chapter and boots, rush the rest of my Morellononicon or wutever its called, and then do L. Echo, Void Staff, Death Cap, Sorcerers Shoes, and then Zhonyas or Banshees depending on if they are AP or AD. (Not in that order). \n\nAre there any particular items within those big items, maybe like seekers armguard or something, that would be good to rush against Yasuo? Is Zhonyas usable while in mid air? Any items I haven't mentioned that I should give a try?\n\n3. How can I come positive in a 1 v 1 situation?\n\n I know that's hard against him but I FLIP when hes a low health, I go in to ult him, and hes like \"nah b\" and puts up a wall to completely block my ult, and then I get crucified by his tornado and ult. Also, that shield he has is so annoying, it negates so much damage that I could of done.\n\nAll help would be appreciated and I thank the people who read this heartful tantrum and decided to help a noob out :P","replies":[{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2019-06-29T22:49:10.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Take {{summoner:21}} or {{summoner:3}} if you're worried about him killing you, or take {{summoner:12}} and know when to back off and reset if he outtrades you. \n\nYou win by not giving him free kills, if you push up the jungler will just camp you or yas will solo kill you, so just farm from a distance, dodge Qs (rush tier 2 boots after lost chapter if you struggle with side stepping his nado), and ping your laners whenever you lose vision on him. As veigar, just scale and pop their ADC with your burst or somebody else, yasuo cannot cast windwall during his ultimate animation so you can combo kill him then if necessary. \n\nDon't try fighting him 1v1 from full HP, if he's low try to bait out his windwall by spamming Q so he WWs to try and block the poke, then you have a 20second window to AA (pop passive) and combo him. You don't win the yasuo matchup by winning lane, so don't bother with that, you win late game when you 100-0 their other carries or get a fat cage at a baron fight. Don't feed and you'll be fine. \n\nThis is how you should play majority of matchups tbh. Farm, be a cage bot for your jungler so they get free kills mid, scale, be useful late game.

Max W, this is my go to, if you against a champion you cant beat(yas, xerath, vlad, etc.) you max W, and when you have 3 points in your W you can 1 shot the mage minions(depending on your stacks, and just sheer amount of AP, usually 2 dorans and a 900g book from morello) and in general, you just farm. A lot of people want o max Q stacks, but sadly with how expensive mage items are, and how weird mages are in general(except xerath) its rare you'll be able to farm your Q without hassle. It's more important to get every cs in that minion wave then it is to maybe get 50 more ap in the first 20minutes.\n\n1.1. You play against him and stay very back, you don't get close to your minions because he can go in and dash around, chunking you pretty hard, this is where the W and walk away comes into play, but in general, play super passive, if the yas isn't braindead, there's no reason you should be able to kill him.\n\n2. If you're really into stacking, if you play the lane right you wont need to rush a hourglass to beat him, against, just stay away from him, and don't go in for a CS if you know you'll take a lot of damage just for that one minion. My general build is . . .{{item:3158}} {{item:3165}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3089}}. I like ion boots a lot because it helps veigars weakness by making your summoner cd short, and even spellbook in the inspiration tree is great, for another 25% less cooldown on your summoners. And with Ion boots, combine that with the 10% cdr you can get from sorc tree, when you complete the boots and morello, you're at 40% cdr, and can start farming away with Q.\n\n1. You NEVER ult him unless his windwall is on CD, it's also a good idea to take exhaust, because if he does jump you, you just exhaust and go \"lul\" and walk away, since it reduces his damage to basically nothing. Try getting rid of his shield with an auto attack, but never do it if you're at risk of him getting on you, yas is also a lane where you just dont win, so the ideal way to play the matchup is farm farm farm, it's a bit boring, but he's mobile and you're not. Also make sure to never E him unless your jungler is ganking, it's the same deal with zed, you hold onto your E until he jumps you, if you toss out your E in hopes to get some damage off, you're giving him a huge window to do some real big damage to you.\n\nIf you want, feel free to add me in LoL, I'm a plat1 player, and I've played veigar since the DFG and instand stun days, if you need anymore advice just hit me up on the game, I don't really look at the boards much anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Water1sWet","date":"2018-01-17T04:59:46.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a lot, I'll try your build out.

Seekers armguard an option?\n\nThere's no real item to rush against most matchups, sure you can go armguards and hourglass rush, but you lose out on early CDR and in the end, that hourglass wont make a difference if he gets close to you and such. Basically your \"item\" is just your playstyle, make sure you keep distance, hold onto e till he jumps you, and you're fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2018-01-17T05:28:08.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a former(?) Yasuo main, I can assure you that there isn't an end all item you can rush against As Veigar. Like any aggressive laner, his goal is to jump on you, so yours should be to keep away. If he succeeded in getting close, then an extra chunk of armor isn't going to help; you are still very squishy.\n\nYour first item rush should probably be the components to a Morellonomicon, with few exceptions. Focus on building yourself up rather than countering your opponent unless you can't avoid scrapping.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2018-01-17T07:13:42.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Watch your incoming lane minions back off before they arrive since Yas will try to use them to flank you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dope Solo","date":"2018-01-17T04:37:40.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't engage hard.  Keep him close to your tower. With V's W, keeping the CS from being really threatening should be mostly easy. You get stronger the longer the game goes. Focus less on Yas, more on using Q to score AP. You'll get windwalled pretty often if you go for EWQR combo. Don't waste it, just do the W. One does not simply 'deal with Yasuo', who sells more skins to get buffs to sell more skins.

His astacks are fast, yet predictable. Just as they have to know what when they can and can't do things, you've got to do the same, and you can pull that off with Veigar thanks to his E.\n\nThe key thing to remember is that your own minions are against you when face Yasuo. At max levels, the dash can only work on an enemy once every 6 seconds. He needs to choose what minions to use to dive in, and then what minions are left to jump back out. For safety reasons, if you're near your minions at all, assume that he'll try to use them to hit you with an auto, then his Q, and then he'll either hit you once more or jump back out. If you time in well, you might even be able to trap him. and avoid damage.\n\nAnd pay attention to when he uses his Q, because after using it twice, he can use his tornado to poke/fuck you. He even has a wind blowing around him to give it away. Watch when he's in a position to shoot it, then dodge.\n\nBut no matter who you're up against, Veigar has a poor early game regardless. As the tiny master of evil, you always have to play smart, not dominantly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OSKAR EL","date":"2019-06-29T22:13:27.891+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":1,"body":"BRO IM VEIGAR MAIN AND I HATE YASUO AND ALSO HE KICKS MY ASS EVERY GAME AGAINST HIM","replies":[]},{"poster":"AR URF","date":"2018-01-17T07:15:11.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I love shitting on veigar as yasuo.
