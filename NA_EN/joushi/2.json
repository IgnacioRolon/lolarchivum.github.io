In this series I'll be taking what I believe to be important concepts regarding designs in League of Legends, primarily about champions, and expanding on them, describing what makes them worth paying attention to. I'll be pulling topics and arguments from things I've read (Riot and otherwise), things I've done, and of course arguments that you the reader make or bring to my attention. So let's get this started!\r\n\r\n----\r\nhttp://riot-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/images/news/August_2014/GAN/dg-ss.jpg\r\n\r\n#**How Many Abilities Do You Really Have?**\r\n\r\nI know what you must be thinking. “Obviously, apart from the obvious exceptions (here’s looking at you, transform champs!) champs all have four abilities!” And you know what, you’d be right! Good job everyone, discussion’s over. We can all go home.\r\n\r\nJust kidding, what we’re more interested in than the number of *abilities* you have, is the number of real *choices* you have when using those abilities. There are a couple important things we need to define here so we're all on the same page. The first being, what constitutes having a choice?\r\n\r\nWe’ll start by defining what isn’t a meaningful choice on your basic QWER, and give a couple examples of each.\r\n\r\n* Passive stats\r\n * Ryze getting 2/4/6/8/10% cooldown reduction on his Q (Overload)\r\n * Teemo getting magic damage and DoT on his E (Toxic Shot)\r\n* Negligible cost undodgeable abilities\r\n * Evelynn’s Q (Hate Spikes)\r\n * Zac’s W (Unstable Matter)\r\n* Autoattack resets\r\n * Jax W (Empower)\r\n * Darius W (Crippling Strike)\r\n\r\nNow why aren’t these choices? Because there’s no meaningful decision you make when you use them, if you even use them at all, they are simply part of a larger decision or there is a strictly best way in which to use them such that not doing them in a given way is actually playing suboptimally. \r\n\r\nThe second and third sets do have the argument that you have to manage mana/energy when you use them, but I’d argue that is part of a larger decision on resource management. Generally speaking, these abilities follow the logic “If there is an enemy it can be used on and it is off cooldown, I will use it.” Go watch a streamer play Evelynn, watch how much he spams his Q button in a teamfight, or when clearing a camp. That’s not a real decision.\r\n\r\nWe’re interested in whether an ability presents an interesting decision every time that you use it, or at least as often as not. \r\n\r\nThis also means that abilities that are simply used as part of a single larger decision are not decisions on their own. An example of this is using Karthus' E (Defile) when going all-in and toggling it off when you disengage. Using E isn't a meaningful decision in itself, it is simply something you do as a result of making another larger decision.\r\n\r\nWe also won’t be discussing choices that are available to differing degrees in all champions. All champions have access to basic decisions like movement, autoattacking, fighting and disengaging, recalling, and summoner spells. We will be focusing on decisions that are unique to the player when playing a specific champion.\r\n\r\n#**So What Counts?**\r\n\r\nSo what kinds of abilities qualify as presenting interesting decisions?\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/T2yeeZm.png\r\n\r\n**Skillshots**\r\n\r\nBy their very nature, all skillshots provide a situation where you (and your opponent) have to make a decision, as you have to decide where to aim. Will my opponent dodge? Which way will they dodge? Is there something in the way that I need to kill before I throw it? The answer you come up with to these questions represents a decision where there might not be a best answer at the time you do it.\r\n\r\nhttp://riot-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/images/news/September_2013/JLCR/Jinx_Comic_thumb.jpg\r\n\r\n**Tradeoff Stats**\r\n\r\nThis is a bit of an odd concept, most clearly represented by Jinx’s Q (Switcheroo). In each of the two states, between which you can freely alternate, you have different stats. The minigun gives you more attack speed, but the rocket launcher has more damage and range, but at the same time costs mana. Other examples of this include Aatrox’s W (Blood Thirst/Blood Price), Master Yi’s E (Wuju Style), and all transform champions (excluding Gnar, damn yordles). These are all theoretically interesting decisions, as which stance you are in presents clear tradeoffs depending upon which you choose.\r\n\r\nThings that this category does NOT include are stats that you simply “turn on” with no significant repercussions. Irelia’s W (Hiten Style) simply gives you more damage at what is effectively no cost. Rammus’ E (Defensive Ball Curl) and Kog’maw’s W (Bioarcane barrage). This category of free stats is actually one of the largest subtypes of abilities, see if you can find them all!\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/3NNOEXO.png\r\n\r\n**Self Movement Abilities**\r\n\r\nMany abilities involve moving yourself to a new location. These usually present interesting decisions, especially when you don’t need to jump to a specific target. Think about when you see the ADC dash in, using their escape to try and do a little more damage.  (Ezreal E (Arcane Shift), Graves E (Quickdraw), Tristana W (Rocket Jump), Corki W (Valkyrie), etc.) They now have increased vulnerability. Initiators jumping in, in order to start a fight, put themselves in the middle of the enemy team, hoping they don’t die too quickly. Should I use my dash to dodge that skillshot? Should I try and close the gap? Should I save it so that I have it in a couple of seconds when I really need it?\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/qQifiV6.jpg?1\r\n\r\n**Crowd Control**\r\n\r\nEspecially hard crowd control. It presents an important decision every time, should I use my stun to stop the assassin from killing my ADC? Or is it more important that I use it to make sure that their mid laner dies?\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/AbhNefN.jpg?1\r\n\r\n**Terrain Creation**\r\n\r\nAh yes. Jarvan trapping his team with his Cataclysm. Anivia walling off the enemy team behind her Ice Wall, letting you all escape. Trundle completely blocking off a corridor with his Pillar of Ice, cornering a target. These abilities are iconic of their characters because of how important the decisions revolving them are. Whether or not the new terrain is placed correctly is so incredibly important that every creation of terrain is its own decision.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/aI6BBXA.png\r\n\r\n**Conditional Abilities**\r\n\r\nThese abilities are important decisions because they do different things based on how, when, or to whom they are done. Does Irelia’s E (Equilibrium Strike) stun them or merely slow? Did Poppy’s Heroic Charge stun her target? Is it better to shield my ally or do damage to the enemy with Pix?\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/RdUd9U5.png\r\n\r\n**Significant Cost Abilities**\r\n\r\nThis is the most obvious one, but I chose to leave it for last so I could get other points out of the way. Significant cost abilities use up a lot of mana, or have exceptionally long cooldowns. Blitzcrank’s Q (Rocket Grab) uses up half of his mana at level one, making it important not to use it idly. Karthus’ R (Requiem) and Shen’s R (Stand United) have cooldowns that are three minutes long when you first hit level six. Summoner spells like flash, teleport, and heal have cooldowns even longer than that. These are important decisions because using them now means you can’t use them later, limiting your options when you might need them.\r\n\r\nThe last important note about abilities being real decisions before I move on to the rest of the discussion is comboing of abilities. Many abilities, such as Jarvan IV’s E/Q (Flag & Drag), Alistar’s W/Q (Headbutt/Pulverize), Orianna’s Q/W (Command Attack/Dissonance) and others, are often effectively one decision. While there are definitely instances where you might want to perform one without the other, in general it is better to simply use them together at the same time and I will often refer to these abilities as “half choices” because of this.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#**Alright, So What?**\r\n\r\nThis question came up as many often do, a bunch of friends and I were sitting around a room talking about what makes champions good and bad, and what exactly made them that way. An important argument that I would often make is that a champion is not necessarily *“good”* or *“bad”*, but rather was *”broken”*. This lead to an examination of characters that fit into these categories of the good, the bad, and the ugly. Err… broken.\r\n\r\nWhat these characters had in common is that they either had significantly more or significantly fewer decisions in their abilities than other characters did, and this made it harder to balance the abilities so that they were balanced and still felt rewarding.\r\n\r\nThe problem with having too few decisions to make is that every decision you make is an interaction point between you and your opponent, and an opportunity for one of you to outplay the other. With fewer decisions, it is usually possible for one player to find abuse cases within their abilities and dominate the game. On the other hand, when there aren’t effective abuse cases, these characters tend to be underwhelming, because they don’t have opportunities to make plays.\r\n\r\nLet’s take a look at a couple offenders of this.\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Warwick_0.jpg\r\n\r\n**Warwick**\r\n\r\nWow, who would have thought that a champion from beta would have a simple kit with relatively few interaction points? Oh, everyone.\r\n\r\n* Q – Hungering Strike: Takes a bite out of an enemy unit and heals Warwick. Target an enemy, deal damage, heal yourself. Low mana cost outside of laning phase and a low cooldown means you should usually be using this as often as possible. Not really a decision.\r\n* W – Hunters Call: Warwick lets out a howl, increasing all nearby friendly champions' Attack Speed for a short time. You mean I get free stats for me and all my friends? At half the cost of my other damage ability? There is no reason not to use this whenever you’re fighting.\r\n* E – Blood Scent: Warwick passively senses weakened enemy champions around him. The scent of blood sends him into a fury, causing him to move at incredible speeds. This one, since it is a toggle, has a minor decision involved. Stealth vs speed. We’ll call it a minor decision.\r\n* R – Infinite Duress: Warwick lunges at an enemy champion, suppressing his target and dealing magic damage for a few seconds. This is Warwick’s iconic ability and only decision that is always important to make. Target selection is of huge importance, and the complete control of the enemy character makes this his biggest decision.\r\n\r\nSo let’s look at this. Warwick really only has one important interaction with other players where he can make a choice. We’ve seen Warwick become very strong recently, because his stats have been favorable, and his stats are often enough to overcome the lack of play in his kit. The smite-ultimate combo that was very popular in Patch 4.20 really had almost no interaction between Warwick and his target, and when he does enough damage to just kill a target, Warwick will be strong.\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/XinZhao_0.jpg\r\n\r\n**Xin Zhao**\r\n\r\nDoes anybody remember Xin Zhao upon release? I don’t, I wasn’t playing at the time. I’m told it was absolutely awful, and videos definitely seem to confirm that sentiment. Let’s take a look at his current kit and see why he could be such a problematic champion.\r\n\r\n* Q – Three Talon Strike: Xin Zhao's next 3 standard attacks deal increased damage that reduce his other ability cooldowns, with the third attack knocking an opponent into the air. While the third attack does present some decision making, as the target you select could be important in context, there’s almost no reason not to just use this as often as you can.\r\n* W – Battle Cry: Xin Zhao passively heals every 3 attacks and can activate this ability to attack faster. Again, this one is even less of a decision. Why would you ever not use the free stats given to you?\r\n* E – Audacious Charge: Xin Zhao charges an enemy, dealing damage and slowing all enemies in the area. This one starts to present more decision making than the other two abilities so far. The self-movement allows you to dodge or to keep up with enemies, or even escape in the right conditions. The interplay with his passive also determines who is gonna stick around when he uses his ultimate.\r\n* R – Crescent Sweep: Xin Zhao deals damage to nearby enemies based on their current Health and knocks non-challenged targets back. Xin Zhao gains bonus Armor and Magic Resist based on number of champions hit. This is again, Xin Zhao’s most iconic decision to make. It can be used in ways that are aggressive and defensive, scattering enemies in all directions, but keeping the primary target isolated.\r\n\r\nAt least Xin Zhao is better than Warwick, but that really isn’t saying much as Warwick has a decision and a half. Xin Zhao at least has two whole decisions. Also similar to Warwick, we have seen times when Xin Zhao is absolutely dominant in the meta as a frontline diver, or an insane damage dealer coming from the Feral Flare, but apart from his times when he is dominating he tends to be hiding in the shadows, pretending to be relevant.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo we’ve looked at champions that have too few decisions, next we’ll have to look at champions who have a lot of decisions. As mentioned before, every decision you have is an opportunity to outplay your opponent. Similarly, every decision has at least two options available, and options are power. By giving players access to more options, it gives the champion more opportunities to outplay their opponent both offensively and defensively.\r\n\r\nWhile there are a lot more points of interaction when characters have more abilities, and therefore opportunities to outplay your opponent, or mess up, when your opponent doesn’t have access to as many options can feel frustrated at their lack of ability to respond.\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Riven_0.jpg\r\n\r\n**Riven**\r\n\r\n* Q – Broken Wings: Riven lashes out in a series of strikes. This ability can be reactivated three times in a short time frame with the third hit knocking back nearby enemies. On her first ability, Riven already has three movement abilities which can be used to dodge or close a gap, the third one providing crowd control and the option to hop over terrain, the only resource being used being the cooldown. There are already three potential decisions on her first ability, that’s as many as the previous two discussed characters already!\r\n* W – Ki Burst: Riven emits a Ki Burst, damaging and stunning nearby enemies. Probably the least interactive of her abilities, simply doing damage and a brief stun directly around her. However, due to the nature of crowd control, it at least still qualifies as a decision.\r\n* E – Valor: Riven steps forward a short distance and blocks incoming damage. The movement of the ability as well of the shield again ensures that this will remain an important decision when you use it.\r\n* R – Blade of the Exile: Riven empowers her keepsake weapon with energy, and gains Attack Damage and Range. During this time, she also gains the ability to use Wind Slash, a powerful ranged attack, once. While the first activation isn’t really an important decision, since Riven just gains free stats when she wants to fight to the death, but the second activation, which is a skillshot and execution has enough considerations to remain an important decision.\r\n\r\nThere’s a reason Riven is such a popular character, whether you love her or hate her. She has so many options available, and everyone has seen plenty of situations where Riven will massively outplay another player, because she has 6 important decisions, twice as many as Xin Zhao and Warwick combined.\r\n\r\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/LeeSin_0.jpg\r\n\r\n**Lee Sin**\r\n\r\nWhen Riot talks about playmaking champions, Lee Sin is usually one of the main ones pointed to, and for good reasons. He has so many decisions to make, so let’s take a look at them. Due to the nature of his abilities this section will have to be formatted differently than the rest.\r\n\r\n* Q – Sonic Wave / Resonating Strike: \r\n* Sonic Wave: Lee Sin projects a discordant wave of sound to locate his enemies, dealing physical damage to the first enemy it encounters. If Sonic Wave hits, Lee Sin can cast Resonating Strike for the next 3 seconds. Skillshot damage. Easily one decision on its own.\r\n* Resonating Strike: Lee Sin dashes to the enemy hit by Sonic Wave, dealing physical damage plus 8% of their missing Health. Now this is what separates this ability from so many others and makes it actually two decisions total. Now, Lee Sin gets to decide if he wants to go in, moving himself into the enemy and either dodging or starting a fight.\r\n* W – Safeguard / Iron Will:\r\n* Safeguard: Lee Sin rushes towards a target ally, shielding himself from damage. If the ally is a champion, they are also shielded. After using Safeguard, Lee Sin can cast Iron Will for the next 3 seconds. While this is all one decision, there’s actually a number of considerations here as well, due to how it changes when depending on how it’s used. Do you need the shield? Will the lower cooldown really matter or do you just need to get over this wall right now?\r\n* Iron Will: Lee Sin's intense training allows him to thrive in battle. For 5 seconds, Lee Sin gains Life Steal and Spell Vamp. This one really isn’t much of a decision, because it’s just free stats again.\r\n* E – Tempest / Cripple:\r\n* Tempest: Lee Sin smashes the ground, sending out a shockwave that deals magic damage and reveals enemy units hit. If Tempest hits an enemy, Lee Sin can cast cripple for the next 3 seconds. This whole ability is mostly just one decision, whether or not you need the slow. The damage is good, but it’s rarely the reason it’s used.\r\n* Cripple: Lee Sin cripples nearby enemies revealed by Tempest, reducing their Movement Speed for 4 seconds. Movement Speed recovers gradually over the duration. Again, this is the reason this ability is used, and as a whole this ability is mostly one decision.\r\n* R – Dragon’s Rage: Lee Sin performs a powerful roundhouse kick launching his target back, dealing physical damage to the target and any enemies they collide with. Enemies the target collides with are knocked into the air for a short duration. This technique was taught to him by Jesse Perring, although Lee Sin does not kick players off the map. First off, that’s actually on Riot’s info page for Lee Sin. Go check it out if you don’t believe me. Secondly, while using it is only one decision, the number of ways this ability can be used, into the enemy team, into your own team, to disengage a fight, makes this an incredibly high impact decision.\r\n\r\nAltogether, Lee Sin easily has 5 important decisions to make in his kit alone. This is again, not only more than the examples that have few abilities, but more than the supposed number of abilities you have. With how much stats the character has, no wonder Lee Sin has been a staple of the competitive scene since his release.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nFrom the examples we’ve seen, the number of decisions characters have can be really important in terms of trying to balance them. Too many decisions and you end up with characters that will remain viable in almost all metas, like Lee Sin and Orianna. Too few decisions and you end up with characters that will either be overpowered or really weak, like Warwick and pre-rework Sion.\r\n\r\nWhile neither extreme is necessarily better than the other, it is important to keep in mind when designing or reworking champions at how much unique agency you give to the player when playing that champion. Similarly, the number of decisions you have available will draw different kinds of players. Someone who just dives onto the enemy carries doesn’t necessarily need as many decisions for the player to make, as it will usually end up with one of the two characters dying. An assassin on the other hand needs a lot of options available to them so that they can jump in, do their dirty deed, and jump right back out unscathed.\r\n\r\nFrom an esports perspective, it’s also important to give options to players, as every interaction point is a place for one person to outplay their opponent. Characters like Zed, Lee Sin, and Ezreal, regardless of whether you think they are weak or strong, are interesting to watch because there are so many opportunities for them to display skill.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nOf course, I didn’t talk about everything abilities can do here. Ally buffs and enemy debuffs, Invulnerability, Invisibility, and Waveclear are all examples of things abilities can do which I didn’t mention. Do you think they count as making something an important decision?\r\n\r\n---\r\nWow you read the entire thing! And if you just scrolled down a tl;dr, shame on you. Go back and read it, I worked hard on creating something I thought you would enjoy and you’ve made me a sad panda.\r\n\r\nQuick shoutout to [dialMARK4acti0n’s Facts, Myths and Theories series](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/mbW28tHJ-facts-myths-and-theories-main-post), as a great read and one of the inspirations I had for starting my own series!

Q toggle, W timing, E target, R target.  One of the most involved ADC kits to play, in fact.\n\nI don't claim to be a great player, but I actually don't find Ashe to have a very complicated kit with a lot of decisions.  That's actually why I like playing her.  Ashe has the same major two decisions every ADC has: (1) where do I position, and (2) who do I attack.  Ashe, like all of the other immobile ADCs, has to be much more careful about (1), and so is more limited in (2).  In my experience, her kit itself doesn't add many meaningful decisions to her play, however.  Her first major decision is (1) do I ult?  This is pretty much the decision that makes or breaks Ashe.  A good Ashe ult can swing a fight/game.  A bad one can lose a fight/game.  \n\nThe rest of the decisions are pretty simple, at least later.  Any time you are AAing a champion, you want Q on.  Any time you can poke, you throw out a W.  In a team fight, you throw out a W almost every time it's up (e.g. unless you are trying to kill a single specific target that is either high value or who is threatening you or another high value target).  When you need vision of a bush/objective, you throw out an e.\n\nI'm not saying that Ashe is simple to play, I'm just saying that I don't think her kit offers a lot of additional meaningful choices over and above the average ADC.  In team fights late, you basically only worry about when to ult and when to throw out w.  There are other ADCs whose kits require far more decisions to be made every moment.  As I said earlier, this is why I love playing Ashe.  I can focus on getting better at the core positioning and target selection aspects of playing ADC.","replies":[{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2015-01-05T22:30:52.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I'm not saying that Ashe is simple to play, I'm just saying that I don't think her kit offers a lot of additional meaningful choices over and above the average ADC.  \n\nAshe E and R have no analogue in other ADC kits, and I think you dramatically oversimplified their usage in your coverage.  Varus R is kinda sorta similar, but its shorter range limits it to being a teamfighting ability, rather than an initiation.\n\nI also think that immobile ADCs have more decision making to do than mobile ones.  Positioning is less mutable and target selection more critical.\n\n> There are other ADCs whose kits require far more decisions to be made every moment.  \n\nI don't think this is true.  Ashe is not so complex mechanically as Corki or Lucian, but they're not really making decisions in the same way that Ashe E or R is a decision.\n\nI suppose this is based on which definition of \"decision\" you use.  I don't really think Lucian Q (or Ashe Q for that matter) is much of a decision.  They will both be used on the primary target when you decide to fight.  Target selection is the operative decision here.\n\nIn my view, the thing that Ashe's design gets right is that it's mechanically simple but tactically rich.  Definitely wouldn't recommend playing her to a newcomer to the role, because decision making is more critical to success on her than just about anyone else.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VDc0zCqe0w","date":"2015-01-05T22:16:26.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i recall many Lulu, Sona, Elise, Zyra, Thresh, Janna at times, Taric, Leona, Thresh etc...\n\ni can't say the same about S4","replies":[{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2015-01-05T23:12:40.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Puffball,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6475Toha,comment-id=00010001000000000001,timestamp=2015-01-05T22:16:26.970+0000)\n>\n> i recall many Lulu, Sona, Elise, Zyra, Thresh, Janna at times, Taric, Leona, Thresh etc...\n> \n> i can't say the same about S4\n\nSeason 4 started as Annie/Leona/Thresh.

You've put a ton of effort into a post that is eloquent yet easy to understand and read through, and makes a ton of good points. I completely agree that one of the main flaws of a lot of older champions is the lack of decision-making, and I think that's also the core issue with a lot of fighters, whose power is largely tied to steroids and stat bonuses. I do, however, disagree with a few of your points:\n\n> Jax W (Empower) [as an ability with no decision-making]\n\nThat would be true if Empower's functionality were only limited to an autoattack, but it can also empower {{champion:24}} 's Leap Strike, so it does carry a decision: do I use this directly as I jump onto my target, forgoing the autoattack reset, or do I wait a little and use it after I dash, spending a little more time out in the open (and giving my opponent a chance to evade the attack) in exchange for a chance to deal more damage?\n\nWhile you tend to label these other factors as \"part of a larger decision\", I still think those factors are important, and can make the difference between an ability with no decision-making whatsoever and a major decision point. Conversely, I think some abilities that look like they involve decision-making actually don't: {{champion:22}} 's Q, Frost Shot, for example, allows her autoattacks to apply crowd control, but the ability itself carries little decision-making and, in fact, reduces options for both Ashe and her opponent (if you have no gapcloser and get slowed, you can't really run away or retreat to safety). All perma-slows have this problem, which is why they're being removed. \n\n>Kog’maw’s W (Bioarcane barrage) [as an ability with no significant repercussions]\n\nAgain, this would be true on its own, except {{champion:96}} is also defined by extreme vulnerability and a sub-par autoattack range. Using it *does* bring repercussions, because without his steroid Kog'Maw puts himself at heavy risk, and the ability's cooldown is long enough that he can never have it up all the time ({{champion:10}} , on the other hand, can become permanently ranged). It's because of factors like these that you can't simply judge any ability or effect in a vacuum.\n\n>These abilities are important decisions because they do different things based on how, when, or to whom they are done. Does Irelia’s E (Equilibrium Strike) stun them or merely slow?\n\nI'd say this is actually a good example of a false decision. As {{champion:39}} , you're *never* going to want to deliberately lose more health than your opponent just so that you can stun them. The conditional just means you have a better chance of escaping or dueling your opponent if you're at a disadvantage, but otherwise the ability carries little decision-making.\n\n>W – Ki Burst: Riven emits a Ki Burst, damaging and stunning nearby enemies. Probably the least interactive of her abilities\n\nI disagree with this. Its cast time and extremely short range means it has gameplay similar to that of a skillshot (with {{champion:92}} as the projectile), where your opponent has an an opportunity to move out of the way even as you're casting it. It's as interactive as the damage on her Q, which can be dodged in the same way.\n\n\nOverall, I agree with almost everything you're written down, and you make a very good point about the importance of decision-making in fun and interactive play. However, I think there are some nuances on ability interaction and windows of opportunity/vulnerability (i.e. using an ability leaves you open to counterattack or some other kind of counterplay) that you need to integrate more into your post. You've set very good general rules, but I still think abilities and champion kits need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and not on their own.","replies":[{"poster":"Joushi","date":"2015-01-05T23:12:25.377+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for reading!

One of my main tactics as Irelia is to engage on them, let them beat me down to just below their health, and then E->W and let the true damage and doubled health restore do it's work.\n\nAs Irelia you always want to lose more health than your opponent when your E is up.\n\nOr to engage when at slightly lower health than them.\n\nThe hard decision is when it's worth to use it for \"just\" the slow.\n\nI'm no pro, but this seems like one of Irelia's strengths and a very much intended part of her kit: Trade subpar and then stun+steroid and you've regained half your missing health while you've been dealing severely increased damage to them.

Not to mention how the passive only encourages spamming further.\n\nThen you get to his ult. Holy shit! That is 3-4 in only one ability.\n\nFirst, during the laning phase this ult presents you with the choice of either using it for sustain (with its 100% spell vamp) or saving it up for the kill.\n\nSecond, when do I use this in a teamfight? Do I blow it right at the beginning in hopes of taking one person down instantly for that giant stat boost and ghost that pretty much wins any teamfight, but easier to negate due to cleanses and shields. I could use it at the end of a teamfight when I am sure to get a ghost, this somewhat cripples your team fight potential yet assures you an even *faster* push.\n\nThird, who do I ult? Is it the mage whose ghost, while mostly useless as a pet, gives me an AP stat boost that is sometimes even better than {{item:3089}}. Or do I take the ADC whose ghost alone can win any teamfight and provide immense pushing power, but the personal stat boost may as well not be there if I do. \n\n\nHe ends up with maybe 1 decision coming from all 3 of his basic abilities combined, yet his ult may just be the game's most complicated ability. \n\nWhat is your opinion on Yorick?","replies":[{"poster":"Joushi","date":"2015-01-05T06:29:50.317+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mordekaiser is such an interesting champion, sometimes I wish I played him more because of how bizarre his kit is, and how high impact his ultimate is. One of the problems with him is since it's hit ultimate he doesn't get to use it very often!\n\nYorick is interesting, so I'll do a quick analysis of him.\n\n* Q - Omen of War: On the one hand, it's an autoattack reset which I don't really consider an ability. However, it does reward him with extra stats, but since that's also not all that much of a decision, it's weird. I'll give it a 6/10 as a choice.\n* W - Omen of Pestilence: This one I'll call a real decision since it's vaguely a skillshot and can be used in different ways based on what you try and accomplish. 10/10.\n* E - Omen of Famine: Again, weird since it functions very similarly to Warwick's Q, which isn't really much of a decision unless you're low on mana. I'll say it's not really an ability. 2/10.\n* R - Omen of Death: This is definitely an important decision, do I want to use it immediately on myself so that I have extra damage right away? Should I use it on an autoattacker early to get more damage out of them throughout the teamfight? Or is having that player alive again when they die more important? Do I want it to be a frontliner or a damage dealer? This is definitely an ability. 10/10\n\nOverall: 28/40. Not many decisions. The problem with Yorick for me is that the decisions he does make are decisions that have little interactivity. Most characters are forced to run away from his ghouls, and later on the mana issues are non-existent. This makes the decisions he has somewhat decrease over the duration of the game and makes it hard to outplay or get outplayed by your opponent as Yorick at almost all points of the game.\n\nAnd thanks for reading!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kitcat300","date":"2015-01-05T02:46:47.459+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> From the examples we’ve seen, the number of decisions characters have can be really important in terms of trying to balance them.

I love playing Warwick (he has been my #1 fav champ since the dawn of my LoL career) but it pains me to see when people dismiss him as an \"ez no skillz\" champ. Sure he doesn't have to click many buttons when fighting, so much that I could even make calls in the chat while move+attacking someone if I needed to, but the decisions that he makes OUTSIDE of his kit and the final, calculated, game-changing decision that he makes when he has to ult somebody makes him extremely entertaining and exciting to watch (note that this is my opinion as a Warwick player watching other Warwick players). Before the ult happens, the Warwick has to calculate the availability of every skill-breaker CC the enemy has, the current damage potentials of his own teammates, the proximity and appropriateness of the positioning, and the prime target of the skill. Fail any of these and you could single-handedly lose your team the teamfight and the game. Succeed, and you can push your team to an unexpected victory. It's like going all-in on a bet where you have one (count 'em, one) chance.  \n\nWhile pushing back that decisive action, there is very little you can do besides guide your team to an optimal setup. Commanding the team becomes so much easier when you're playing a simple champion like Warwick in solo queue. He is a powerful champion at taking objectives. He is strong at taking dragon or baron, can split push, or effectively support a heavy tower siege. With his simple kit he can make so many decisions about how to pressure the map while lying in wait for the perfect ult. Sure, there are other champs who can pressure all areas of the map just as well, but none of them can do it with such a simple yet decisive kit as Warwick's.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UberAffe","date":"2015-01-06T06:37:00.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"FYI I have started going through champions and rating them, and it is going to take a loooooooong time but something I realized about riven is that even though she does have 3 choices with her q its really only the 3rd one that is important to her. personally I would say that the q as a whole is 10/10 a decision, with the first being 3/10 second being 2/10 and third being 5/10.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2015-01-06T04:35:40.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What they need to do is what they did to Sion.

I have recently been spending time thinking along the same lines.\n\nYou have framed the conversation in terms of meaningful choices.  I think this is an interesting lens through which to view champion kits, and yields a lot of great insights.\n\nRather than try to perfectly formulate and connect all my comments, I'm just going to throw some disjointed thoughts:\n\nI think an interesting angle to look at some abilities in is that not only do some abilities not require many meaningful choices, but they actually REDUCE the amount of meaning other choices have.  Every player in league is making meaningful choices all the time.  As an ADC or other squishy, where you position yourself in the moments before a team fight represents a huge meaningful choice at each moment that can have a big impact on the game.  If you make the wrong choice at any of these moments, you can get caught out and cost your team the game.  Mobility abilities, however, can reduce the impact of each of these choices, and make them less meaningful.  As Ezreal, your choice of where to position yourself leading up to a team fight is still very meaningful, but it is not necessarily as meaningful as the same choice by a Varus player, because you have an ability which allows you to instantly get away.  Thus, dashes and blinks and other mobility abilities may increase the amount of meaningful choices you have, they may also decrease the meaningfulness of other choices you make (e.g. where you position yourself).  Akali's and Wukong's stealth abilities operate similarly.\n\nOn a related note, some abilities REDUCE the amount of meaningful choices other players have.  Poppy's ult and Trynd's ult are great examples of this.  If you're fighting a Poppy and she ults someone else, you have very little meaningful choices to make for the duration of her ult.  If you're fighting Trynd 1v1 and he ults, there's a good chance your choices just got narrowed down to \"run\" or \"die\".\n\nIt is perfectly okay for a champion to have an ability that makes a champion's mistakes more forgiving (like a blink) or that reduces opponent counterplay (like temporary invuln), but it is important for that ability to be a balanced part of a healthy kit as a whole.  \n\nSome champion's kits are so cohesively directed toward a single play style that looking at each ability individually overstates the meaningful choices made when playing the champion.  Burst champions are the offenders of this that come immediately to mind.  For example, with Annie, although your Q, W, and R all could be characterized as having meaningful choices, after the laning phase, if you cast one you are generally going to unload the rest as well.  Your choice, at any given moment, it basically a binary choice: do I go in.  Sure, she has the choice of which spell to initiate with, and what target(s) to hit, and whether to use her ult, but for the most part she just goes in or she doesn't.\n\nAkali is perhaps an even more extreme version of this.  Akali just goes in.  If she's ahead you die.  If she's not, she dies.  If you try to run, you will die, because her kit gives her the ability to go in over and over tied to a point and click ability that she can't miss.  Warwick when he was overtuned was a slightly different version of this.  He still went in with a point and click ability, but he could only go in once.  However, he usually killed whoever he went in on, and he was tanky enough (plus lifesteal) to ensure he was still going to be a factor in the fight.\n\nAt the end of the day I generally agree with you that the kits with the least meaningful choices are the most problematic, but I think it's mostly a function of ease of use.  If a champion has a kit where a lot of the power is tied to abilities that are hard to mess up mechanically (e.g. point and click abilities), and has a simple play style that is easy to grasp (e.g. nuke the other person), then the champion is either going to be oppressive or undertuned.\n\nI think that Sona is an interesting champion to look at in this discussion.  In theory, she has a ton of meaningful decisions to make, when you look at the different auras she can use and the different power chord choices she can make.  In reality, however, she is a champion who has a straightforward play pattern and a lot of abilities that are hard to mess up.  This isn't to say there isn't some advantage to mastering Sona, as I'm sure there are nuances and a great Sona player can get a lot more out of her than the average player, but an average Sona player can still utilize a large portion of her power budget.  Compare this to Thresh, where an average Thresh player will come nowhere near being as useful as a great Thresh player.","replies":[{"poster":"Joushi","date":"2015-01-05T23:45:30.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow there's a lot to take in there!

I responded with this to a comment elsewhere: \"Zed, like you said, has more escape opportunities built into his kit, so going in with his ultimate (while still an important decision!) can have less consequences if something goes wrong. Warwick on the other hand, once he's in, has more difficulties getting out so his initial decision (ulting someone) is more important, like you said.\"\n\n> On a related note, some abilities...\n\nAgain, very true, and part of the reason (I think) that these characters tend to be undertuned. When your opponent doesn't have important choices to make, it can be a lot of fun to do that to someone else, but it's not very fun to play against, so they are kept weaker so fewer people have to play against it.\n \n> Some champion's kits are so cohesively directed toward a single play style...\n\nThis is one of the biggest things I think I could have described better in the article, and something I alluded to a little bit with discussion of \"larger decisions.\" There are many abilities you use as part of another decision. Natural combos like Jarvan's Flag&Drag or Jayce's Gate+Shock blast are big offenders of this in many cases! If you use one, the other one is almost required to be used as part of the initial decision, thus making the exact means by which the decision is executed less important.\n\n> At the end of the day I generally agree...\n\n*Cough {{champion:13}} cough*\n\n> I think that Sona is an interesting champion to look at in this discussion...\n\nTrue, but always remember \"someone who plays a character more than other people will see nuances to a kit that someone who only plays them in ARAMs will.\"","replies":[]}]}]}
