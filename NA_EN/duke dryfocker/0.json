If not, I&#039;m in the top 1%, which ironically is the exact opposite of my MMR.  I grew up during the beginning evolution of video games.  I won&#039;t disclose how far back that is, but it involved paddles.  \nThat being the case, I understand there&#039;s a new game called &quot;Forkknife&quot; sweeping the nation!  I thought my league friends could hip me to what it&#039;s about!  I read an article today on the World Wide Web, about a Major League Baseball player suffering from tendonitis due to playing it! Must be one hell of a game!  I mean, are there spoons too!?  Must be a bonus item or something.\n\nTY in advance for your info ABOUT &quot;Forkknife&quot; :)\n\nLeague is Life\nStay in School............forever if possible\nLove,\nTHE DUKE\nhttps://ibb.co/n5e5fd","replies":[]}
