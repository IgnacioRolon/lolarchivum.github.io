I want to go back and try to get better at rift.  Dont know what champ to try or anything.  I have Malz at Rank 4 so I try him mid.  4/11/4 with only 68 cs in 25 mins.  Team kills 45-16.  It was weird because I haven&#039;t played Rift much since the days that mid was only rangy mages.  I was facing a Yasuo and a Roaming Xayah.  It was an awful experience.  I don&#039;t even know where to start to improve upon it.  \r\nAdvice?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-21T19:30:17.413+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play rift more.

My flip actually synced with yas super well.  I didnt have a sparkling Kda but I had 19 assists, the most on the team.  Maybe I need to stick to support or top?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-21T21:06:55.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  Yasuo\n\nSounds like you also have little to no normals ELO, going to take a while for matchmaking to stabilize.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
