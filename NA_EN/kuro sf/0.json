I believe this is contributing to an environment where savvy players dodge games with unranked teammates, causing them to \"double stack\" into other teams, where they get 2-3 unranked players per team. Sometimes there might be unranked on the other team, sometimes not.\n\nPlease, Riot, get these unranked (and low confidence MMR) players out of the ranked queues. They are toxic for games.\n\n\n---\n\nHow do we do this?\n\nForce them to solo-q for normals in a special \"qualify\" phase, so they can get a provisional MMR while playing normal games. \n\nMatchmaking can use these normal queue games to give a player an estimated MMR... once the MMR has high enough confidence (over ~10 games), then they will be allowed to play ranked with that provisional MMR.  If they AFK during this period, their MMR quality resets (aka, they will have to play a minimum of another 10 games).\n\nOf course even after this provisional \"qualify\" period, the system won't have a perfectly accurate MMR, but at least it will be better than throwing completely random MMRs into the ranked queues -- unevenly on the two teams.\n\nWhy is this a win?\n\n1) players who only play &lt;10 \"ranked\" games a season will never actually be in the ranked queues\n2) players who afk once every 10 games will never actually be in the ranked queues\n3) players who have not played 10 games last season will need to actually play a bit before they can be in the ranked queues\n4) new players will need to get a provisional MMR before they can get into the ranked queues \n\nAll of these things will reduce noisy MMR and increase team equality.. which will increase the quality of games and *fun*, while reducing toxcity.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-01-06T20:02:47.972+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Isn't this already present in the form of placement matches?

You get unranked \"should be in Iron\" all the way through ~G3 (or higher smurfs). You get people who have no idea how to play the game, and people with years of experience in the same game. This wastes time on games decided by matchmaker RNG not by demonstrated player skill differences.**\n\nI don't care how riot improves this situation, but this is the situation I would like improved.\n\nMy idea, to improve it.. is to have people do a \"qualification\" round in the normal queues, so get them a prelim MMR before they are allowed into ranked.\n\nThis is no problem for the people in normals, because they are in normals and dont care. This is no problem for the person qualifying, because if they are going to play 100 games in ranked, 10 qualification games don't matter, and if they are not going to play 100 games in ranked, we don't want them in the ranked queues anyhow. \n\n Either way, the match maker can find out if they can maintain 50/50 winrate. If they can't, then their MMR drops until they can. Once their W/R is 50/50 over ~8 games, they are given that MMR as their provisional ranked MMR... If they lose ~15 games in a row, they would just be placed in iron.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Imbetterthanmoe","date":"2020-01-06T21:30:09.559+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Riot purposely puts unranked players into silver and gold elo to stimulate a climb feel to these new players.

Science shows gamblers are addicted to losing, not winning.\n\nIf players had an orderly climb right to their appropriate rank, where they would then either plateau or actually work hard to improve themselves.. the game might not be as \"compulsively addictive\" for those so inclined. The only people who would keep playing are the ones who actually want to get better.\n\nInstead what we get is 60% of games in silver include an AFK, or iron uranked, or some other complete game-tanking situation on one of the teams. Addicted players see that as a \"win\" when it goes their way, and a \"loss\" when it does't.... I just see it as waste-of-time RNG, because over 100 games, 60 of them are decided by matchmaker RNG.. which makes the climb slower. \n\nAlso, the RNG makes things really lottery like. Get some good RNG on those outliers, and you can jump tiers quickly. Get poor RNG on those outliers, and you get demoted to the bottom. \n\n---\n\nI get that if you are truly diamond or whatnot you can climb your way out of this, by winning some of those 60% games... making the climb maybe only 15% RNG.. but what if you are truly silver/gold trying to understand how to improve?
