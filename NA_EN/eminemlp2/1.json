By the time i reconnect the game ends, and now i have 5 game low priority.\n\nThis is the Second time this happened, if there's anyone with the same issue and have some type of solution please Share.\n\nIf there's anyway for one of the staff to remove this low priority from my account it would be amazing (if possible).\n\nThis not AFK.

We definitely need to try and address those crashes before you hop back in the queue, since it sounds like some of the game files might be corrupted.
