Upon entering Platinum 5, i have lost my last 2 games.  If i lose my next game will I be demoted?  Some people claim that it depends on your MMR.  Is this true? According to na.op.gg my MMR is 1829, or \"normal\" by the algorithm's standards.  \r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"DaejinTye","date":"2014-10-15T08:43:41.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah. There is a buffer for fresh promo's... I'd imagine you can lose the first 5 without being demoted.","replies":[{"poster":"Goochapotamus","date":"2014-10-15T08:48:59.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you,\nThat makes me feel a bit better lol.  I just want to hold out until Nov. 14 for the Plat rewards XD.  So that means i can wait a few days and play one more game.  Then sit pretty until the end of the season","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2014-10-15T08:41:29.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you wont","replies":[]}]}
