Though, I think its specifically using portals that lead to/from Bandle City as its mode of transport, seeing as how its now former master was a Yordle. That being said, unless there's a portal in the vault Ryze hid the Runes in, I don't think it can take someone directly to there.\n\nStill, its more dangerous than people realize. Though, given that it is sentient, I think someone who intends on using it for evil purposes might have trouble with it. Even then, though, what can Yuumi really do to stop someone from taking it? She's a magical cat that, as we know right now, can't really do anything dangerous to protect the book.
