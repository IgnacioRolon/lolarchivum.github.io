While you do need to play against better opponents to improve, it needs to be gradual. If the skill gap between two players is too high, the guy getting smashed not only won't be able to learn as much since he'll literally get overwhelmed. But he might also get discouraged and literally give up. Players need to feel they stand a chance in order to have the will to improve. \n\nSo actually, yes you can miss out on learning if you're only fighting people 5-6 times your skill level. It's why good matchmaking is so important in competitive games.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Battalion","date":"2017-12-06T21:07:44.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"For future reference: It is very easy to find your username having even one username of anyone who played a game with you.\n\nGoing to a site such as http://na.op.gg/na\nSearching for the summoner name of \"Xezzy\" your Teemo\nI can then find the game with the same team composition as what's listed in the screenshot.\nYour summoner name is Alpha T1. \n\nIt'd be better to cross out all names. \n\nIt reminds me strangely of another player why the name of Tyler1, a Draven one-trick, who calls himself \"Alpha\" and likes to \"Run it down mid\".
