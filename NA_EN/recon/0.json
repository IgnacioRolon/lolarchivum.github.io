It just recently started happening. I am playing at 38 ms and then my game will randomly spike to 80 ms and my champion won't move or cast spells, but I see everyone else moving normally and am able to click around my champion. I have checked and flushed my dns to see if I was dropping packets, but I have lost ranked games because during laning phase I will just not be able to move, and I die. This is EXTREMELY frustrating and I was hoping there is some feedback about this.\n\nThank you\n\nEdit: I have a clip showing it, but not sure if I can post. I have done all the steps listed in the website regarding network configuration. I have checked with websites regarding my DNS and switched it to the Riot recommended one. My ISP is obviously on a break, but my speedtest shows normal upload and download speeds. I have reset the routers, and done manual CMD pings to the riot server which shows stable 32ms. There are no programs running, downloads, or anyone else on the router. I've looked for all basic answers to this\n\nThe problem are these random little 3 second spikes where I just can't move. As a midlaner I am unable to play the game this way if there is slow reaction or if I stop moving then I can throw the game by giving FB or dying in a teamfight.\n\nTwo clips showing what i'm talking about:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/rz5xPHWZC_0?t=8m23s\nhttps://youtu.be/rz5xPHWZC_0?t=46s\n","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-03T05:08:14.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you've already gone through the basic network steps in our connection guide and are still experiencing issues, we'll need to take an in-depth look at your network routing to our servers to find what's causing this issue. This looks suspiciously like *Packet Loss*, so I'm pretty confident that a traceroute test will reveal what's going on. To do this, I recommend grabbing a network app called WinMTR, which you can grab [**here.**](http://winmtr.net/) After loading up the app, plug **104.160.131.1** into the host field before starting the trace. After it's been running for 5 minutes, export the results as text and paste them in a reply.\n\nLet me know if you run into any issues with those steps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Recon","date":"2017-01-01T23:38:35.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really hoping to get an answer on this.
