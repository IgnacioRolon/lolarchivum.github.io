I'm interested in knowing what the items guys think, so ask a few questions and try to pop back here sooner or later with a response.\n\nHey man--if you want to know what I think, just ask!\n\nPersonally, I think the breakdown here is mostly that Dead Man's Plate gives greater rewards because it requires actions to \"unlock\" them (you have to move around without getting hit by CC, and it's basically done doing its thing once you've initiated--which is great, because it has defined strengths and weaknesses as a niche item for champs that want more initiation power), whereas Sunfire is basically at this constant, steady burn so it can't really do anything at DMP levels of cool since it's \"always at 100%\" more or less.\n\nThe Cinderhulk upgrade in one of its earlier iterations was pretty interesting, in that it was essentially Sunfire cape with more gameplay to it--this is the item that would allow a tank to be a threat if left alive, and largely benefited champions that wanted to commit to longer fights, a back-loaded power compared to DMP's front-loaded power. Since that in-combat scaling is no longer a part of Cinderhulk, I think reincorporating it into Sunfire's passive effect will not only make the two more distinct from each other, it could also allow it to be more situationally powerful and thus a match for DMP's situational power. (This could also be a neat tandem \"AoE magic burn threat\" with the new Abyssal Scepter if it ever makes it to live, much in the same way that Rylai's and Liandry's play so well together--allowing tankier champions to sacrifice some durability for raw aggro generation)\n\nOr you can just buff the numbers a bit to make it more gold-efficient, I guess that works too.","replies":[{"poster":"Eph289","date":"2015-09-23T15:20:30.479+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm showing myself as an old forums guy here, but logged in to say that I read this comment and at the first mention of \"DMP,\" thought \"Dance Master Phreak\" instead of \"Dead Man's Plate.\" Only when I saw the second mention did I realize your true intent. >_> \n\nObligatory link for the forum newbies: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIVbLgmElvA","replies":[{"poster":"Sasogwa","date":"2015-09-23T20:21:28.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Eph289,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ji7ME6sY,comment-id=002b00010000,timestamp=2015-09-23T15:20:30.479+0000)\n>\n> I'm showing myself as an old forums guy here, but logged in to say that I read this comment and at the first mention of \"DMP,\" thought \"Dance Master Phreak\" instead of \"Dead Man's Plate.\" Only when I saw the second mention did I realize your true intent. >_> \n> \n> Obligatory link for the forum newbies: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIVbLgmElvA\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iexPTpv_4_c","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zielmann","date":"2015-09-23T17:10:53.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As another old-timer, I had forgotten that existed. \nThis made my morning.\n\nNow I really want to believe the acronym for Dead Man's Plate was not an accident...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ultîma","date":"2015-09-22T20:28:35.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be cool if Sunfire had more going on to it rather than _just_ flat burn damage as an aura.

Stack with Reinforced armor to grant 400-40=360-36=324 damage received =76 reduced damage assuming a 400 damage crit auto. After ~8-9 crit auto attacks from an ADC, new randuins is better. ~3000 damage received in both cases, ignoring non-crits. Factoring in non-crits feels like it makes new Randuin's quite a bit worse.\n\nThornmail: If I'm reading right, you can get ~200 bonus armor lategame, and deal 100 extra reflection damage. Carries autoing you would get reflected for a ton more than this when they crit before the changes, but now it's more normalized, where a reflect deals a much more consistent value, regardless of the attacker's damage. Thornmail reflects less to lategame ADCs, but reflects much more to low damage incoming autos, making it better at small scraps, and significant against on-hit enemies (teemo, fizz, devour bruisers) and mages/supports who weave autos between casts. I'm concerned about it being harder to tank lategame ADCs with these combined changes of thorn/randuin\n\nDead Man's Plate: I'm concerned about the addition of mobility-enhancing tank items to the meta. If Juggernauts like Garen get too strong this patch, the stated solution is to remove some of his champion specific mobility. This concerns me because it can force him to find his mobility in items like this and glory, instead of having the freedom to build specifically tank resistances. These items are restrictive replacements for Garen's tenacity, and movement-speed duration that have already been taken out, and the thought of further reducing his mobility if he seems 'strong' makes me shiver.\n\nFrozen heart, nothing much needs to be said. It's a few hundred gold harder to buy.\n\n\n\nIf I'm reusing this argument from someone else, please let me know, but I think it's the kind of specific feedback about the recent patches that RiotRepertoir was asking for.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Red Ryu","date":"2015-09-25T02:34:50.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ji7ME6sY,comment-id=002b,timestamp=2015-09-22T19:59:02.168+0000)\n>\n> Good discussion.

Most of them already have ways to get in and disrupt the back line, so they don't really need Dreadnought (though it wouldn't hurt them), and most of them also drop off in damage pretty hard once they've unleashed their combo, which makes Crushing Blow both redundant and useless. This type of champ makes more sense to build Sunfire Cape on.\n\nJuggernauts are tanky damage dealers, NOT tanks. Their purpose isn't to disrupt one team and peel for the other so much as to shred one or two squishies while ignoring the rest of the enemy team. Sunfire Cape doesn't make sense on them, because it's offensive against the team when they only want to murder one or two members. Further, they usually lack great engagement skills, and if they do have them (like Jax or Darius), it's hard to stick to the person they want to kill—and this is more important for juggernauts than tanks because their point is to stick to someone, not lock them down. DMP makes much more sense on these champions.\n\nIn a League that focuses more on bruisers than tanks, DMP will overshadow SF Cape, but that's not a bad thing, and there are still many champs that would rather build Cape than DMP.\n\nHowever I am but a humble Bronzie so feel free to poke holes in that.

Really. Lots of players have this misconceptions.
