I plan on having scrims, game night, and even rp prizes for when enough people join the community. \r\n\r\nEveryone is organized by what role they main, and have an elo tag as well so you can just post in the LFG section of the chat, or send people personal messages.\r\n\r\nWhen you come to the server, please message the owner with your main role/rank (the owner is specified on the right hand side) because mostly everything is blocked for you until you can be tagged. \r\n\r\nhttps://discord.gg/011amLs7jFpouaKfT If you dont have the app downloaded, you can just post this in your browser and it works just the same.
