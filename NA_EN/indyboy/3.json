Like it feels bad to pull up the top lane champions and not see a champ like Leona. Like is Leona very good top lane? Not really. Can she go top lane, heck yeah, but she's not in the top lane sort option. I just feel like this system is made to pigeon hole people into picking specific champions for specific roles rather than to encourage creativity which completely goes against the old Riot's modus operandi. Maybe I'm just overthinking that though. Does anyone else feel that way?\n\nSo my main request is that they bring back the role sort option in champ select. I really miss it. Pls Rito hear my call.\n{{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[]}
