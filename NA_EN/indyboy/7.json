Some of these have been said before but I'm just sort of organizing some of them into one cohesive thread. I'd like to see maybe one or 2 of these be looked if possible.\n\n**Auto attack animation:**\n-Cass's auto attack animation is sooooo incredibly slooooooooowwwww. When I'm trying to last hit with my autos I feel so vulnerable and its feels so blegh. I really would love it if Riot could increase the travel speed of Cass's autos and reduce the animation time.\n\n**Having to stand still while casting Noxious blast:**\n-Now whether this is done for the sake of balance or whether its unintentional I feel like this would be an amazing change to Cass. If its for the sake of balance though I would understand. Though I will say if Syndra can cast her Q while continuing motion then why cant Cass. Just something to think about.\n\n**Having to stand still while casting Twin Fang:**\n-Ok this is something that needs to change. Honestly. Like I don't mind THAT MUCH that I have to stand still while casting Q but when I'm trying to kite backwards with my E I feel like its almost impossible sometimes to position myself properly and continue to deal damage. If Cass really is this APC markmenesque carry that is meant to kite around fights and while lacking any sort of mobility outside of her Q movement speed boost, then I feel its only fair that she retain her mobility when casting her twin fang. Call me crazy but in this league of insane mobility assassins and bruisers I don't think its too much to ask to be able to continue my movement away from them without having to stop while kiting. Like its one thing for an ADC to do it with the click of a mouse, its a whole nother for Cass since she has to first off land her Q(while standing still I might add) and then having to nail them with her E's.\n\nThis last one I've been told has been discussed already and most likely is already in the works just stating it for the lolz basically and to keep everything centralized.\n**Clearer particle effects on her poisons:**\n-Basically just make her poisons easier to notice in big teamfights so she can use twin fang properly and effectively, blah blah yadda yadda.\n\nSo basically these are a few QoL concerns I have, if anyone agrees with these I'd love to hear. If you don't you can go sit in the corner with Teemo.(lol jk) But seriously if you don't agree pls tell me why.\n\nEdit: After playing around with new Cass I almost wanna say i would prefer the Q change over the E change but I couldn't tell you. Both would just make everything about everything so much nicer with Cass.","replies":[{"poster":"Serpents Embrace","date":"2014-12-12T01:06:48.154+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":5,"body":"Trying to QoL the current iteration of Cass is useless, because no amount of power or ease of use will make the playstyle Stashu is trying to push rewarding and fun.","replies":[{"poster":"IndyBoy","date":"2014-12-12T01:17:14.194+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":9,"body":"Me: *checks opgg profile*\n*mfw you haven't even played new Cass since the update*\n:^(","replies":[{"poster":"Serpents Embrace","date":"2014-12-12T01:39:02.899+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"I don't have to in order to read.\n\nHe did nothing to address the actual problems, so nothing about my opinion is going to change.","replies":[{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2014-12-12T02:19:39.653+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":11,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Serpents Embrace,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WPsf4IHw,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2014-12-12T01:39:02.899+0000)\n> I don't have to in order to read.\n> \n> He did nothing to address the actual problems, so nothing about my opinion is going to change.\n\nHow do you possibly know that unless you play it though?

You don't **embrace** curses, especially when their effect has already taken its complete toll. *The idea of the passive is not only already done, it doesn't fit here.*\n\nGameplay-wise, the passive sucks because the rewards it gives you aren't tantalizing. You can get 30% bonus AP from Rabadon's. You can get 25% CDR easily, and having it forced on you actually limits your itemization. And the on-hit heal is just pseudo-spell vamp. Nothing the passive gives you is *actually interesting*, just regurgitated stats.\n\nOh.

I've barely played at all lately, if I do it's often to kick back to fight the monotony of studying and getting that first win IP. I've played the new Cass a number of times, enough to give feedback and critiques. I'll probably give her one more shot or two after the Finals are over, but considering how little I'm enjoying her, it'll literally be for the sake of providing feedback. However even THAT is harder than it sounds. Play blind-pick and I have to fight over who gets to mid and see who locks their champion in first.

I have never played Cassiopeia since her update myself, but the two Cassiopeia's I met were struggling even with the new changes to avoid dying. Heck, one of them was feeding their lane... in Intermediate Bots.\n\n>This is important because it allows you to have both damage and wave clear which the previous iteration of the post reworked Cassiopeia did not have. \n\nI disagree with this because Cassiopeia still has to both poison and then proceed to spam Twin Fang on creeps in order to actually get rid of them, but most other mages can clear waves while spending less mana.\n\n>I then went on to make the point that the new Cass now had enough damage to Kill her lane opponent at level 2, which the original post-rework Cass could not do.\n\nRight.\n\n> Also you are correct, I probably did not have to type in all bold or to space my words out as I did.

If you can't stay calm when writing your piece, either say so (e.g. give yourself a margin of \"I'm human please don't treat me like I'm perfect\"), or don't post. I do this (frequently I actually write a reply and just never post it \\>\\ P.S.

Serpents Embrace never, EVEN ONCE, played the new updated Cass against actual players yet he claimed to be all knowing about how she now functioned and played. \n\nThis is false because 1) PBE 2) Smurfs 3) Friend experiences 4) Videos. You do NOT need to have played a Champion in order to know how they function, you need to watch it be played OR play it yourself. The latter gives a better view, but both give you information-- and lots of it.\n\n>Its very frustrating trying to talk with someone like that, not to mention the fact that he consistently was miss-interpreting what I was saying and making incredibly wild accusations about my opinions as if he was basically ignoring what I was writing.

How do you know Serpents Embrace wasn't being jovial and merely messing with you, playing devil's advocate for your argument?\n\nShort: You don't.\n\nHence, why would you say this? Just admit your own faults, don't push any onto others. If you only admit your own faults, it makes you seem stronger as a character, and people tend to be decent judges of character and tend to agree with people who have characters that they individually agree or sympathize with.\n\nA better way to say that you're \"man enough to admit it\" would have been\n\n>#In short, I need to type more clearly-- and I'm man enough to admit to that.\n\nNothing else.

The auto attack animation and the poison indicator no. they are minor changes that don't really have THAT much influence but they would be nice little changes to make her feel more fluent.\n\nNow the mobility changes to Q and E.... I have no idea, I feel like that would be something that should at least be tested in beta. If it turns out it pushes her over the top then no. But if they don't then why the hell not. Cass could use a small change to her mobility, and the PBE and internal test are perfect for testing this kind of stuff because it doesn't necessarily mean it would go live.\n\nAlso to be honest I think I would trade a bit of damage on new Cass for the small mobility buffs.
