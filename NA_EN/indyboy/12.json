I had issues controlling my temper and I deserved it.\n\nSince then I&#039;d like to think that I&#039;ve gotten a lot better. I hold my tongue, I only play when I&#039;m in a positive mindset, never when I&#039;m drinking(which were my most toxic games), and I try and pick my teammates up if they&#039;re having a rough game.\n\nBut now I&#039;ve started noticing, maybe because I&#039;m a lot less toxic myself, how toxic people are in this game, ESPECIALLY in ranked. Like Jesus Christ some of the things people say in this game are freaking horrible, and yes I mute them but god bless if you or one of your teammates makes one little mistake, in comes the hardcore flame. It could be something along the lines of, &quot;you're worthless piece of human trash and no one will ever love you, go kill yourself\" and that&#039;s on the tame side.\n\nI mean sure I get the response, &quot;why don&#039;t you just mute them?&quot; I do.\nI feel like it&#039;s every game though. Everything starts off fine, then someone makes one little mistake and boom, shit hits the fan and it becomes a flame war. Then, I end up having to mute basically an entire lobby... and their pings, because getting question mark pinged by 3 people when I make a mistake is definitely not fun either.. Or better yet they tilt the other members of my team and then we lose because everyone starts playing for themselves or just not thinking when they try to make plays. Not to mention that communication is basically out the window at that point.\n\nThe best experiences I&#039;ve ever had in this game are when both teams are relatively equal in skill level and people want to communicate and play at their highest level to accomplish the goal of winning the game, and when both teams are rocking that kind of mentality is where this game really shines, and I stand by that.\n\nI&#039;ve played this game since season 3, I really do love it. I&#039;ve put hundreds of hours and tons of money into it and NOTHING has ever made me want to just stop playing as much as dealing with toxic people which IN ALL HONESTY is probably much more of the community than Riot bans. Like you have to be absolutely out of control for Riot to even give you a chat ban, I should know, I was there at one point. I probably wont stop playing though, I like this game too much, I like how competitive it is, but I have to admit, muting entire lobbies, playing with people who hate your guts to the point of spewing absolute trash at you, or flaming the fuck out of your teammates who don&#039;t have the mental composure to just mute people and continue playing because they&#039;re upset is just not fun and it never will be fun.\n\nIMO it might be a good idea for riot to start &quot;cracking down&quot; on people. Give people more chances but chat restrict them more times, maybe they&#039;ll catch a hint, I did. I dunno, I&#039;m just not having as much fun as I used to and I&#039;m probably not the only one.  Peace, love, and prosperity.","replies":[{"poster":"Zombie Gerbil","date":"2018-03-20T02:54:39.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i misread","replies":[{"poster":"IndyBoy","date":"2018-03-20T03:17:51.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was suggesting that they increase the ban rate not decrease it nor was I suggesting they give toxic players \"breathing room.\" I just was saying that maybe they need to reform the restriction system, as in instead of only banning 5 percent of people maybe they should ban 15 percent and make the bans less impactful. If people get chat restricted more often, they're less likely to flame.\n\nI'm not saying I'm leaving league either I even said that in my post but to me it just seems as if toxicity hasn't really decreased in the years I've played this game. You're free to disagree with that but that's my honest opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"Zombie Gerbil","date":"2018-03-20T03:40:19.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am extremely sorry, I misread the whole thing. \nI hope they do crack down on toxic players and I agree they should ban 15% more. That might put a scare into the toxic individuals. I believe they will eventually. I hope you can find the fun in this game again.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
