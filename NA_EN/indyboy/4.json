{"poster":"IndyBoy","date":"2017-11-29T10:58:36.321+0000","title":"Zoe Nerf Propositions","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"I&#039;ve been putting a decent amount of games into Zoe since her release, both as and against her, and I feel as if the champion is a bit overpowered.\n\nThe number one major issue I have with the champion is that at early levels her sleep last entirely too long. It allows her too much reliability on her Q and because of this her damage is way too consistent at early levels. Also I feel its worth noting that her sleep is not just a 2 second stun(which is already insane btw) it&#039;s a 2 second stun coupled with a slow prior to activation so an over 2 second cc which is ridiculous for a skill on such a low cooldown that even acts as a trap if you miss(the trap range being quite large mind you).\n\nA good comparison I found is Veigar. At early levels Event Horizon(his stun) only last 1.5 seconds, couple that with the fact that it is telegraphed before it goes off it makes it much more forgiving to Veigar&#039;s opponents and allows them to react accordingly. As the game goes on though the stun duration for his E goes all the way up to 2.5 as you level it which makes it more useful as the game progresses.\n**(On a side note getting cc&#039;d, especially for very long periods of time, is a very anti-fun experience for opposing players. Combine that with how well it works with her kit and the damage it allows Zoe to deal, it makes playing against Zoe quite an anti-fun experience at times.)**\nMy main proposition is that the duration of Zoe&#039;s sleep be reduced at early levels to allow for more counterplay by her opponents and time to actually dodge her damage at early levels after Zoe&#039;s cc ends.\n\nThe second issue which is much less pronounced I would say is Zoe&#039;s early game damage. I believe she ramps up a little bit too quickly and could do with some toning down at early levels. Part of that being damage to champions and the other part being how quickly she can wave clear so early in the game. I consistently find myself clearing the back line of minions quite early in the game which not only makes farming quite easy but help to push my opponent under tower where I can harass them with my artillery with ease. An interesting way I think they could make a slight nerf would be by lowering the range of Zoe&#039;s ultimate at early levels, her ult range being directly tied with her damage and damage consistency. Other than that another option would just be to just outright nerf her base damage on Q dramatically and then buff her scaling to compensate. That would make her much less oppressive at early levels but still a late game powerhouse that can still skillfully assassinate carries and chunk tanks mid and late game.\n\nThese are all just some ideas I had, would love to hear some other opinions or ideas. Thank you for reading.\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"F4keS4lt","date":"2017-11-29T13:18:55.528+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My main problem with her is her E true damage.

Her job starts to become that of a poke mage and the true damage allows her to be a great tank buster as well as offering good assassination potential on squishier targets. The issue being if you're going to give her all this late game power you need to compensate by weakening her in the early game which just isn't the case currently.\n\nAs of right now her early game is a bit oppressive and she ramps up too quickly in my honest opinion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Unreformed Shaco","date":"2017-11-29T11:21:47.108+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I play her and against her and her windows for outplay are huge.\n\nShe is so easy to outplay.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahris","date":"2017-11-29T11:58:41.397+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Unreformed Shaco,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=07N3qg5H,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-11-29T11:21:47.108+0000)\n>\n> I play her and against her and her windows for outplay are huge.\n> \n> She is so easy to outplay.\n\nShe shouldnt ever really be outside of jungle during teamfights.

What types champions do you play? Who are you playing? Are these assassins? Mages? I'd love to hear.\n\nPersonally I've found she does struggle against certain assassins that can close in and limit the range of her Q in particular. But that in of itself does not indicate that she is perfectly balanced in all aspects. But again, tell me your perspective.","replies":[{"poster":"Psyrix","date":"2017-11-29T13:16:11.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the mages that do well agaisnt her: Orianna, Syndra, leblanc, Ahri and Viktor do pretty well against her.   Azir as well.  I'd actually say most of her matchups are skillbased, rather than her actually countering anyone.  (haven't played or gone against her as Taliyah, Cass and Ryze so can't really say for those).\n\nFor some assassins it's a skill matchup, however some will completely decimate her if she doesn't play safely (Talon for example)","replies":[{"poster":"Psyrix","date":"2017-11-29T13:22:53.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I say it's a skill matchup because her main damaging abilities are skillshots, and tiny ones at that.  Use your minion wave to your advantage.  Pay attention to how she fires the her spells (her range is always at max 800 units from her model, estimate that, monitor the CD of her spells, pay attention to the visual indicators and dodge to the side [perpendicular to the skillshot]  or stay parallel to ur minion wave [behind them], the splash damage isn't that big.","replies":[{"poster":"IndyBoy","date":"2017-11-29T21:24:12.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't feel it's fair to say that her skillshots are tiny, they're really not. Her Q missile speed is quite fast and it explodes into an AOE which is great for harassing people who try to use minions as cover. Plus not only that her range is excessive. I've found myself in situations where I've been hit by a max range sleepy bubble, during the drowsy part of the bubble I've flashed for cover, and she STILL hits me with Q in spite of my flash.\nHer E also is quite large, granted it's a lost slower, and even if you miss it stays on the ground as a large trap which acts as a great zoning tool in lane.\nAlso another point that I made in my post was that Zoe clears backline way too quickly at early levels which makes it much much easier to harass her opponents because then they can't even use minions for cover. So when you say, \"Use your minion wave to your advantage\" I respond with, that's not always an option because her wave clear is too strong.\n\nLeblanc isn't really a mage, I would say she's definitely more of an assassin and again I would say that Zoe has a hard time against assassins in general that can close the gap on her which is also part of the reason why I think Ahri might be good against her, especially if she could use her ult to dodge bubble. Malzaharr is also another great counter pick to her because he can MATCH(not outpush) her early wave clear and his shield makes it almost impossible to land a bubble if he plays smart.\n\nFor some of the other champs I'm not sure I would necessarily agree that all of those do well against her. Syndra I'd probably agree with, and Azir seems like he would function a lot like Malz in that he could match her wave clear early enough so I could understand him doing well vs her, though I will say I haven't personally played the matchup. But for Ori and Viktor I'd have to say that I don't agree, their wave clear early is a bit lack luster compared to Zoe and I feel like she does quite well into immobile low early game damage mages with mid level wave clear because she just has to push them into tower and then harass them with her long range poke.","replies":[{"poster":"Psyrix","date":"2017-11-29T22:48:31.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The missile itself is tiny, the splash is what makes it seem large, and that's why I said stay parallel to the minion wave if ur gonna use it to block the spell.  \n\nIf there is no wave, dodge perpendicularly since at that point it is an extremely tiny skillshot with nothing to splash on.  The wave has to be in a specific alignment that's why she has to wait for the minions to spread out (try her out if ur able and u'll understand what I mean)\n\nCounted Ahri and Leblanc as mages since the nerfs kinda make them function as mobile burst mages (poke poke before the extreme killpotential) and since they do magic damage without some device (it's their own power) they still are mages xD.  Orianna and viktor have quite good wave clear :/ especially viktor.  And even then it's not really a battle of waveclear, it's a battle of zone control.  Viktor's stun (and just general damage) and orianna's ball placement are major zone controllers.  Orianna can move while she casts her spells, making her a harder target to pin down.","replies":[{"poster":"IndyBoy","date":"2017-11-30T00:06:06.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes mid game Ori and Vik have decent wave clear that's why I specified early. Early in the game their wave clear is average, while Zoe's is well above average and that in of itself is quite a big deal.\n\nAlso yes her q itself is thin, but that means a lot less when it moves about the speed of Varus Q. You either have to be dodging prior to it being launched or you have to already be out of range of it, which is more of an issue if you're pushed under tower.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dracovicus","date":"2017-11-29T15:37:13.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bad news ZOE GETS BUFF TO HER Q","replies":[{"poster":"IndyBoy","date":"2017-11-29T20:54:10.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you referring to the change that was hotfixed to live on 11/22?
