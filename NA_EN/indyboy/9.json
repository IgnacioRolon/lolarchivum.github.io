Soundcloud link:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/user-956579527/509359922a\n\nIf everything else could be affected by the volume slider (allowing me to mute them) that would be great.\n\nIt would really be neat if I could mute the HUD without using mods. I've been playing with it muted... For probably years now (around the same time you introduced the ping volume slider). I like spamming buttons, and some of the sounds hurt my ears (and give me a headache), which is why I originally muted it. And now with you guys moving to the WAD format, this is harder to do (I need to remake my mod every patch), and I'm also risking being banned if you guys ever change your stance on cosmetic mods and just start banning anyone with modified WAD files.\n\nThanks for all your hard work, and thanks for reading our posts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"theRedCheck2","date":"2018-03-10T01:00:08.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Although I didn’t have issue with the sound volume settings being switched by sound is essentially inoperable.

I can not focus on playing the game if something plays too loud and I can't hear other sound effects (and that's also one of the reasons it's difficult for me to play Evelynn, because the sound is so different when her passive is active). Less of an issue when a sound effect is missing, I'll probably still catch the visual effect with my eye. But a sound that deafens me just distracts me.\n\nNow I know Riot has updated their sound engine. Whatever it changes, I have no idea, but for one I know such sound issues happen once in a while.\nEven in 8.4 I read some people complaining about announcers voice being off.

I have a few ideas at what may fix this, we got this!\n\n1) I see you have alot of processes running on your computer. Some of which could be interfering with League of Legends. To eliminate the possibility of that happening, let's turn off your unnecessary start up processes. This has the added benefit of making your PC boot up faster :)\n\nGo to your start menu and type in the search area, \"Command Prompt\"\nOpen Command Prompt and type msconfig and then hit enter\nA window shall open, select Selective Startup and uncheck Load Startup items.\nClick Apply, OK and then restart your PC.\nAlso, make sure TunnelBear VPN is off for now just to make sure its not interfering with League.\n\n2) I notice you have a few Overlay programs running. Any overlay program can cause crashing in League as it conflicts with League trying to have priority over processes running. Below are the overlays you'll want to keep off for now:\n\nWindows 10 DVR - Follow this link to disable xbox DVR: https://www.howtogeek.com/273180/how-to-disable-windows-10s-game-dvr-and-game-bar/\nDiscord has an overlay in User Settings > Overlay - Keep that off as well\nPlays.tv - Uninstall this program to prevent it from turning back on while in League\nRainmeter- Keep off while League is running\n3) Let's try a complete config reset which will clear your settings incase of any corruption:\n\n*First open the launcher, log in, and then minimize\n*Next go to your league folder located at C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends and delete the folder called 'config' completely\n*Finally try to launch a custom game\n\nIf your issue persists, please send me updated HRT logs so I can continue to investigate the issue.\n\nLudusBonus\nJax Main\nRiot Games Player Support{{item:2012}}","replies":[{"poster":"T o m a s u m i","date":"2018-09-26T20:01:45.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That didn't help me, I still can't hear chat clicks and ping sounds, I also can't hear the sound when I buy items, Everything else is fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"allaxxor","date":"2018-03-19T11:06:18.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The guide above is pretty interesting, I'm sure, but IT DOESN'T ADRESS THE ISSUE AT ALL!\n\nThe freaking victory/defeat sound is so loud, its ridiculous.
