I already know I got 9 times reported because my team surrendered at 15 and it was a ranked game. Now I don&#039;t know if I should play again because if the issue happens again not only will my team lose the game but there&#039;s a chance I&#039;ll get leaver-bustered.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve seen others mention that they&#039;ve had a similar issue and I was curious if any Riot support staff had a definite solutions to the issue.\r\n\r\nExtra details:\r\n-Running windows 10\r\n-Had a program called YoloMouse running in the background which helps me keep track of my mouse ingame. Closed that before reopening client first time, didn&#039;t help.\r\n-AMD Phenom(tm) ll X6 1090T Processor 3.20 GHz\r\n-12 GB Ram\r\n-GeForce GTX 1060 Graphics card\r\n-Pulling up and typing in chat is what spurred the issue, did not even finish message before crash occurred.","replies":[]}
