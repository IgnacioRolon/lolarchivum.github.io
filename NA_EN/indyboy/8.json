In my opinion her Q being a targeted ability really used to helped with her consistency, sure her new Q is longer range, but it’s slow and is blocked by minions so it’s incredibly inconsistent.\r\n\r\n**Q is underwhelming:**\r\nI’m just going to make this its own thing even though it ties in with the first part, her new Q is wayyyy too inconsistent. Sure the range is longer but the cast time delay and the slow missile speed completely neuter this ability and make it much less powerful for catching people out. Her old Q was much more consistent and even though it had a shorter range was much better for catching people out. NOT TO MENTION it can’t go through minions anymore which only makes it more inconsistent.\r\n\r\n**Ult is just bad now, or at the very least highly underwhelming:**\r\nHer old ult used to allow her to auto attack while she was invulnerable which made her an amazing duelist as well as making her much more of an issue in team fights. Before the changes you used to be able to walk up to a good number of champs, especially enemy ADC’s, and just completely outduel them, she’s absolutely lost that ability in a ton of matchups. Sure, the damage is nice but that implies that you, a ranged champion, are now in melee range of your target…… what. I’d rather just be able to kite properly and mitigate the damage from other ranged carries and still provide auto damage to a fight. It just feels like it doesn’t synchronize well with her kit anymore.\r\n\r\n**This champion cannot function without a frontline anymore:**\r\nIn my honest opinion if you don’t have a frontline you’re at a distinct disadvantage now compared to old kayle. At least with old Kayle it used to be much easier to either A: go off and split in a side lane and duel people or B: catch people out with your Q(which I’ve already discussed is much more unreliable now.) Now it seems like you’re forced into the role of being an ok ADC with mediocre mobility and the inability to provide consistent damage while ulted.\r\n\r\n**The only 2 possible changes I’d like:**\r\n-The ability to auto while ulting. This is the big one to be honest, please Rito. Give me back my dueling machine, I personally would take a massive damage nerf on her ult for the ability to auto through this.\r\n-Range and/or missile speed increase on her Q. Also the ability for her Q to travel through minions.\r\n\r\nThose are my biggest issues with new Kayle, I’d love to hear what people thought. Thank you for reading. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Titanium70","date":"2019-03-19T15:11:38.476+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"First thing to realize: Kayle is currently on the strong side! If anything Nerfs are what you can expect over the next patches. \n\nThat what's currently on PBE:\n\n- AD per level lowered from 3 to 2.5\n- Attack speed per level lowered from 2 to 1.5\n- Celestial Blessing (W) Bonus movement speed from AP lowered from [10% per 100 AP] to [8% per 100 AP]\n\n----------------------------\n - The Q in it selfe is fine. It's a strong Spell with alot more use than the old Q and 50% Armor shred is INSANE, especially for TFs!\nSadly its indicators as well as its visuals are complete dog shit! The amount of times I think \"WTF that hit\" OR \"WTF that didn't hit\" is hilarious even after hundreds of uses by now! Just compare the indicator to Graves and Lissadras Qs... \n\n- To no longer be able to AA while Ulting was to be expected. It's something you need to get used but once you did it really doesnt bother you as much. I prefer a stonger Kit with the current ult HEAVILY over a weaker Kit with the ability to AA while Ulting. This feature simply eats far to much of the total powerbudget - imo.\n\n- I somewhat agree on your last point which is why I play Kayle in Midlane instead of Top. IF you have a stong fighter (like Renek, Darius) by your side you can pretty much 2v5 without much sweat. Besides, outsustaining a Mage in Mid is easier than surviving a Diver on Top! (Most APs in Mid are actually weaker than you early on! #nerf_mages btw.... my ass!)","replies":[{"poster":"IndyBoy","date":"2019-03-19T22:04:20.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going to address your points and rebutt on each.\n\n* The Q has use if you have a front line and you can get solid front to back fights, in a 1v1 it's much worse. You only need the armor shred if you're trying to cut down tanks, it's not nearly as effective and or reliable when you're trying to duel.\n\n* The thing is that her kit would be stronger if you could AA while ulting, I think that you're sacrificing a lot of damage by losing the ability to attack while invuln. The damage compensation you get from the ult damage is much less than you would have if you could auto for the 3 seconds that your ult is initiating.\n\n* I don't believe mages should be losing to you mid lane, I just feel like people probably don't know how to pick into her and so they don't understand the matchup and over time she'll start seeing people exploit her lack of range and early game damage. In theory ranged mages should absolutely dumpster her early. Mages I would imagine would be good picks into Kayle would be: Syndra, Orianna, Cassiopeia, Malz, Veigar, and Zoe. Also I would imagine that a lot of assassins would have decent matchups vs her such as Leblanc, Kassadin, Ekko, or Fizz. Now I'm not positive because I haven't specifically played these matchups but theory crafting would leave me to believe that they should give her a very hard time.\n\nRegardless of her win rate I still think she's in a bad spot and I think these changes are premature. The attack speed nerf is serious and I have a feeling that that, combined with people understand how to punish her, is going to drop her to a much lower win rate.\n\nAlso one more thing, on the note of the inability to not play her into a comp that lacks a front line, I don't necessarily think it's such a bad thing, it just means she's a niche pick that can't be blinded into just any comp. But I also think that Kayle's identity used to be that of a duelist AS WELL AS that of a late game hyper carry and they took the dueling part away from her which highly limits her playstyle and makes her one dimensional, which I'm really not happy about.\n\nEdit: I'd just like to add one more thought. If they swapped Kayle's level 6 and level 11 passive upgrade she would make an amazing ADC/APC and all of this would be irrelevant cause she could just be played as a bot laner. Mostly because you would have a much better chance of having a front line from either top or jungle and depending on whether or not you had an AP or AD mid you could just build the opposite or even hybrid so your team would have split damage types.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rester","date":"2019-03-19T10:45:38.290+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you want her to auto while ulting they'd have to take away the damage from the ult itself.\n\nHowever I will agree with the whole Q thing.","replies":[{"poster":"IndyBoy","date":"2019-03-19T13:42:14.493+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"100 percent would give up the damage on her ult to be able to auto.
