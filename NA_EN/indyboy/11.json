Here is my exact Quote:\n>ONE THING I THINK NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. This is very serious and I think you really need to look into it Stashu, I'll make an entire thread on it if I have to. Is the clarity of targets that are poisoned. In big teamfights I feel it needs to be necessary that targets that Cass has poisoned are actually poisoned. Like some times I&#039;m finding myself mashing Q and trying to spam E and sometimes I can&#039;t tell if my Q actually landed or if I&#039;m about to hit a target with twin fang and put my E on cooldown.\n\nI was responded to by a Rioter, **Riot Stashu**, and here was his response:\n>There&#039;s actually a thread on this (well, poison indicators in general) right now that&#039;s gaining some traction, and it&#039;s something that we&#039;d definitely like to do. Totally agree that it would go a long way, the current particles are just not up to par with the clarity bar we&#039;ve established over the past few years.\n\nI went looking for the thread he mentioned and never ended up finding it. It wasn&#039;t a top priority for me at the time so I sort of brushed it under the rug since it wasn&#039;t that big a deal.\n\nFast forward to today and poison clarity has still not been updated. So I&#039;m posting this thread to try and resolve that and offer what I feel would be a reasonable solution WITH PICTURES! :D\n\nHere is the current poison indicator:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ImopLoP.png\nIt&#039;s very subtle and hard to spot in big teamfights.\n\nNow my personal proposition is that poisoned targets are fully highlighted purple when poisoned. I got the idea from the animation for the move &quot;Toxic&quot; on Pokemon Stadium shown here:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/WyrscB7.png\nThis would add a lot of clarity to poison and I think it would be healthy for poison based champions as well as their opponents.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read through and I hope we can find a way to resolve this.\n\n**Original Source Material:**\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/2YmVu2JW-cassiopeia-421-opinions\n\nEDIT: I was hoping we could get a Rioter's opinion on this as well if possible.","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Skill Tank","date":"2017-11-18T08:45:36.352+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"No, because if there would be multiple champions poisoned in one teamfight it would REALLY hurt clarity instead of helping it.","replies":[{"poster":"IndyBoy","date":"2017-11-18T09:59:43.011+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dont stop Niisan,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Q3QMcIQO,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-11-18T08:45:36.352+0000)\n>\n> No, because if there would be multiple champions poisoned in one teamfight it would REALLY hurt clarity instead of helping it.\n\nI definitely believe your point has some weight to it, but I also believe that there has to be some kind of middle ground to all of this. Maybe a solution not quite as ridged as what I was suggesting, but again something that does help with the lack of clarity of targets who are poisoned because as of right now I still feel like there is definitely an issue as it currently stands.","replies":[{"poster":"LazyW0lf","date":"2017-11-18T21:03:24.442+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if the entire health bar was outlined in purple","replies":[]},{"poster":"RunninInThe90s","date":"2017-11-18T16:07:49.568+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just have an effect like Sunfire Cape's orange ring, except purple, around poisoned targets.

It would allow players who are just trying Cass for the first time a bit of a cushion and it might help lessen the learning curve a bit. I mean she's definitely difficult enough as is, some QoL changes might do her some good.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Poro","date":"2017-11-18T18:12:15.502+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree. I'd definitely like it. I'm just not sure if Riot thinks it's worth the effort. If it only has a purple recolor for Cassio, I don't think it's too much clutter. \n\nHowever, we have to be careful with recoloring a full champion because there'll be conflicting situations like Olaf ult + poisoned: which color takes priority?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Boiled Triangles","date":"2017-11-18T11:47:49.753+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think just adding a purple tint to the poisoned champion (sorta like in the pokemon stadium screenshot, but more pronounced) would work just nicely.

I myself have issues tracking targets in teamfights and it's even worse when I try to look for specific particles. Then when you add something like graves ult and twitch poison it makes it basically impossible for me to see the tiny poison particles at times. I also agree though that this change should take into account the aesthetic qualities of opponents champions. I mean you pay good money for a skin, you don't wanna sit there purple all game and not enjoy it, you have to admit though it would make people try to avoid getting poisoned to avoid the dreaded purple tint. xD","replies":[]}]}]}
