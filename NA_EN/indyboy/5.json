Now that&#039;s what I&#039;ve heard but I have yet to see anything conclusive on what that conversion rate will be, when we will know that conversion rate, if our current orange essence will increase or decrease in value, and what I have heard has been few and far between.\r\n\r\nI would really appreciate if a Rioter could please respond and give me the rundown on whether or not skin shards are officially being reduced in value, will our current orange essence reduce in value and if so will it also be multiplied to compensate, and if it has yet to be officially announced I was wondering if you could provide a time frame for when we might know any of this information.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}
