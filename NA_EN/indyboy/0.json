There was a literal crap storm of negative post from the get go. Most of them fell on deaf ears. Heck just before the rework dropped on live Riot started the \"Lets talk Cassiopeia\" thread. I dare you to go back to that thread and read through the FIRST FEW PAGES. 90 percent of the post are negative, or completely against the rework. Please, be my guest. Side note, that thread went on for a full 300 pages of discussion almost completely devoid of Riot involvement for MONTHSSSSSS. Also you know what, you say we're being immature for speaking out against the rework? Well you know what? We're all consumers, we put time and money into this game and it kinda really sucks when a company decides to completely ignore our, the consumers, opinions. All we ask in return is that our opinions are listened to. But no. No matter how much criticism we drop on this rework, no matter how many post we make, no matter how many numbers we crunch, or well thought out post are written, almost all of it falls on deaf ears.\n\n> Cass wasn't even 'reworked'.

Her late game power spike isn't even worth the trouble you have to go through to get there. Even champs like {{champion:75}} or {{champion:67}} have better early and mid games and they provide just as much of a late game as Cass currently provides now. That combined with how inconsistent her damage actually is makes her completely pointless to play over basically any other mid laner. I could name a massive laundry list of champions who do everything Cass does but better in early and mid game stages and then still be just as powerful as her late game.\n \n> Yeah, she's a bit weak on live right now, but the changes going through will help her immensely. She will be MUCH more capable of carrying games that she is in, and that really only leaves tweaking the passive to make it feel a bit better.\n\nThe juries still out on this. It took him MONTHS to even do something as small as this, why should I trust that this will actually change anything. Also you know what, I just wish for ONCE.... FOR..... ONCEEEEEEE. That they would freaking ASK, JUST FREAKING ASK what WE, the consumers would like to see in terms of changes. But what ever dude, the new changes including the ones being dropped in 4.21 fit YOUR playstyle so obviously you could care less. Also I reiterate something I feel is important. 1.2 percent. That's her pick rate right now, that's the TON of people you mentioned like the new Cass. That's like nothing. This rework hasn't done anything to help this champion, its only hurt her and the people who enjoyed her and none of us even had a say in it. So I feel like the only reason you're justifying the changes is because they fit into your playstyle, not the preferred playstyle. \n(I'm not even mentioning her win rate btw because it is completely irrelevant even if it is negative.)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FlubbyDG","date":"2014-12-11T02:32:50.786+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"AFAIK, she was not reworked because she was deemed \"OP\" or lacked counterplay or anything, but because she was weak in the meta. I also remember someone mentioning that strong DOTs are \"anti-fun\" because it's hard to tell how much damage you've taken/are taking. I also remember a rioter saying they want champions to have one, distinct and unique role/experience and do that one thing well.\n\nWell, as far as I can see both reasons are crappy in this instance. Cass *did* have a unique playstyle - she felt uniquely poison-y, in a way completely different from Singed, Teemo, or Brand. As for the \"anti-fun\" of DOT's, this applies to all DOT champions and should be addressed via visual indicators NOT (more obvious icon, purple healthbar, etc).\n\nThe effectiveness of DOTs isn't about an opponent \"not realizing\" they are losing HP, it's puts them into a \"time management\" counterplay. They can all-in before the damage kills them, since they have some time before it does. They can run back and try and heal up.\n\nPicking one champ who specializes in DOTs, and than nerfing those DOTS to put focus on the other spells, is silly. I'll admit I've only played Cass one time in an aram, but I've racked up tons of games as old Cass, and my inital experience of her update was \"ugh, she doesn't poison anymore. all i can do is run around throwing fangs at everyone. I know longer feel like a cool, venomous threat in lane ....instead I feel like some sort of weak mage-nasus who spends the entire early game hoping be relevant.\".\n\nInitial verdict (admittedly based on 1 aram): terrible.\n\nAlso, it's understood that Riot will never completely revert a reworked champ. Not only is it doubtful they'd change their minds so much, but it would make them look bad, like they'd made a mistake, and also give the impression that they'll cave when a bunch of players rage over something. New Cass is, unfortunately, here to stay.\n\nDOTs actually have more counterplay than straight damage, imo. If you get DOT'd and know you're dead, you can all-in instead of running. Or, you can run before you're actually low, to avoid \n\nicking on one champ who specializes in DOTS and just making the actual *D* in DOT useless.\n\n\nI don't anybody was ever asking for a late-game hypercarry focus, and I'm not sure why they chose that (I recall","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xaihady","date":"2014-12-10T22:09:17.150+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a solo laner who loves tackling difficult champions with a high reward potential. Pre-work Cass seemed to me to be a niche pick; a champ who was powerful but because of her lofty skill floor wasn't played as often. Which was tantalizingly fantastic to me. Around late summer I decided I finally wanted to learn her, but I heard she was getting a rework, so I figured I'd wait until after the fact to start.\n\nAnd once the rework hit and I did try her out she was certainly difficult to do well with, so I didn't think much of it because difficulty is what I expected. But after a few games passed and I started getting the mechanics down, I realized that the bulk of this difficulty was coming from an inability to hold her own in lane and a power rise delayed way too long. Plus, getting those stacks is horrendously BORING. Sure, if I survive to late game my E does mind-boggling damage to the enemy, which was fun for a while, but it's all just slapping down some form of poison and spamming a point-and-click ability like mad. Cheap and unsatisfying. It doesn't feel so beautifully TOXIC, like the Cass I remember seeing played and was excited to play. \n\nI'm just sad beyond belief that I never picked her up before.

Cass used to be one of the defining definitions of \"lane bully.\" She was strong early & mid, and could still scale well into late game. A mechanically intense champion who was high risk / high reward.\n\nThe nerf was to her AP ratios. Q&W ratios were absolutely gutted and basically became utility spells (even though the Q speed buff was also dramatically nerfed at lvl 1, making it pretty useless in utility until it's rank 3), and also slightly to her Ult. All her dmg was loaded into her E, which was given a QoL update. Before, E would reset to a .5 second CD if it *hit* a target that was already poisoned. Due to travel time of the spell, this made the actual CD time of the spell anywhere from .5~ if you're right next to a target, up to .7-1 second, if you were farther away. With the QoL update, it made the .5 reset happen *if the target is poisoned,* meaning you can **potentially** double your E output in trades.\n\nWhat I remember loving most about Old Cass was turning those early-mid game ganks into 1v2 double-kills. A well timed Ult, take out the lower-health target, and then either finish off the 2nd enemy, or die but have the satisfaction of having the last tic or two your poison (which they stupidly sat in while trading you down), finish them off as they walk away thinking they've won. Always #worth.\n\nEdit: They also nerfed the early AP ratios of E, so it's not even of the same ratios until rank 3. But w/e. A lot of these things are being addressed in patch 4.21, which I'm gonna be excited to play when I get home. Q is getting a flat 20% movespeed buff at all ranks, and E is gonna add a poison amp debuff that'll stack up to 40%, and if you start your combo with a W, you could get some pretty decent dmg off I imagine.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2014-12-09T07:15:06.056+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shit, did Stashu just temporarily go black there?

That's all I'm trying to say, and it gets kinda frustrating when we have all these new Cass players playing her just BECAUSE she got reworked without even knowing what she was before and how much fun she used to be. ALSO on that note we get a lot of people who didn't play pre-rework Cass who just spout off what Riot told us about how she was \"toxic\" and too much of a \"bully\" when that's absolutely not the case.
