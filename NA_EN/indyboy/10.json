Please review the ingame coms and you will see how unfair the situation is.

It seems like it is only a problem if there is a pattern of negative behavior in that match and other recent matches.\n\nI think the ban you received was because of instant feedback on slurs and phrases since even though you didn't call anyone bad things people can still see the slurs. I think you should send a ticket to riot and explain the situation with your chat logs. They might not take it back or maybe reduce it because the goal as a player is to NOT say any slurs or offensive phrases in any context.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HonestJohnTheCon","date":"2018-04-02T14:27:19.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think so, but it's an easy way to start a flame war in-game, so I'd only do it if it's a straight-up troll.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Paintchip","date":"2018-04-02T07:38:51.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":10,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Freshairkaboom,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=e4avec6v,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-04-02T06:26:31.982+0000)\n>\n> Report talking and circumventing filter.

I think it's unfortunate that I got banned if it was an automated system that got me but the point is 95-99 percent of the time people are using those words irresponsibly to either hurt other people or amongst themselves.

Feel free to downvote me as much as you like. The community consensus is clear. Also, disagreeing is not flaming. It's not taking it too far to call someone brainwashed when they literally behave the same way as 99% of toxic people in their chat logs. That's just stating a fact. I used to be the same way, so I know. I've said my fair share of \"report X for Y\". I'm done with that part of my life.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"zacktootall","date":"2018-04-02T06:13:25.255+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"ticket","replies":[{"poster":"IndyBoy","date":"2018-04-02T06:14:46.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just submitted one.
