Also atm he&#039;s not that great of a pick. I've also played some Kog is an ok option but the only thing with that is you can&#039;t really rely on people to peel for you in solo queue.\n\nSo my question is if anyone has any good picks to throw at me when you&#039;re in desperate need of some AP. Side note, I don&#039;t mind mage or other role suggestions, just anything that you&#039;ve tried that works well.","replies":[{"poster":"Prison AnaI","date":"2018-03-24T19:54:21.481+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"is corki actually that forgotten lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rewt","date":"2018-03-24T18:45:06.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Honestly, just pick a tank buster and take Cut down.

I'm a support main that's basically turned into an AP mage support main due to all AD comps or no wave clear comps.\n\nCorki, Varus, Kog, and Kai'sa would be my suggestions for a AP ADC so your teammates don't rage at you for not picking an ADC.  There might be others, but I can't think of them right now.  If you don't mid playing a mage, Cassio, Kayle, and Azir can fulfill the DPS mage you might want.  Ziggs works but you have to focus on taking towers with him.  He doesn't have the same DPS in teamfights as the others do, but it's something.\n\nFor Varus, you can try Wit's End, Guinsoo, Beserkers, into AP items like Banshee/Zhonyas/Void Staff/Death Cap.  Basically you start out for attack speed, but swap to AP later in the game.  There's a Korean ADC main who's been doing this for a while now, so you can go through their [OP.gg](http://www.op.gg/summoner/userName=%EB%B0%94%EB%A5%B8%ED%9E%98) if you want to see other choices they make.  I assume that build would work on Kai'sa as well since it would make her passive hit harder.  The benefit to this is that you get the ADC DPS with the safety of having Zhonya's or Banshee on these champions to help if you misposition.","replies":[]},{"poster":"S0l0Cl0N3","date":"2018-03-24T22:13:07.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Malzahar.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jocomotion","date":"2018-03-24T20:11:11.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:42}} like {{champion:96}}  deals a lot of magic damage for an ADC. {{champion:110}} can also build on hit AP, but this is a lot trickier.
