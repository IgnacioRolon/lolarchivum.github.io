Contact Player Support for more detailed info\". I have tried to contact support, but every time JENNY711 is in charge of my ticket and doesn't even read it, just copy and paste the same message, JENNY711 didn't supply me with proof to my reason of ban, this has made me believe this ban was unjust.","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2019-07-15T05:46:09.537+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try a live support ticket.","replies":[{"poster":"UdealCornelius","date":"2019-07-15T05:52:01.203+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i have, look at the video","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2019-07-15T05:56:08.323+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats just a regular ticket.
