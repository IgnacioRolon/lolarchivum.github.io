Im a jungler, team was hard core flaming me for not gaking, when all 3 lanes were losing pretty hard, bot legit fed 5+ kills in the first few minutes of the game. Im not going to gank a lane that can kill us 2v1. So Yes I was negative, but i was also stating the truth? If a lane is 0/5 and keeps aggressing fights without wards, saying that they&#039;re feeding isnt that nice, but it is objectively true. Last part of the chat was in all chat, after i muted the whole team. Also I did ask for garen to be reported because he griefed and afked in fountain while still typing last 10 minutes of the game. Not illogical to ask for people like that to be removed from my future queves. Bot was also a duo, so im sure they both reported me, top probably did too, but they were just toxic, and i dont see what i did thats report worthy as far as communication goes. Maybe im just too full of myself? Idk\r\n\r\nCould I have handled this better, for sure! I should have just ignored everyone and mute alled off the get go.\r\n\r\nps, first few lines someone asked about favorite pokemon lol. \r\n\r\n\r\nlog: \r\n&quot;Game 1\r\nOtzy: lickitung\r\nOtzy: or lickitongue? idk anymore\r\nOtzy: i only know like the old school shit\r\nOtzy: ty\r\nOtzy: top flash\r\nOtzy: gj\r\nOtzy: soon\r\nOtzy: eh worth\r\nOtzy: janna has to move up with us\r\nOtzy: play safe\r\nOtzy: and farm\r\nOtzy: dont aggro at all\r\nOtzy: youre so behind\r\nOtzy: stop pinging at me like we can fight lol\r\nOtzy: bot\r\nOtzy: go farm\r\nOtzy: stop fighting\r\nOtzy: you guys are feeding\r\nOtzy: not if people keep trying to skirmish with 1/3 their cs\r\nOtzy: ?\r\nOtzy: no one was there\r\nOtzy: easy kill if people are there\r\nOtzy: youre alone\r\nOtzy: were in jungle\r\nOtzy: wake uop\r\nOtzy: definitely the guy whos 1/4, not 4/2\r\nOtzy: 1/5*\r\nOtzy: wc\r\nOtzy: inner team conflict\r\nOtzy: ?\r\nOtzy: what did you want me to do there\r\nOtzy: it was 2v45\r\nOtzy: 4*\r\nOtzy: im just gonna mute all, you guys have no game sense\r\nOtzy: garen just decided to afk -.-\r\nOtzy: should be over soon lol\r\nOtzy: ik and my teams been flaming me all game cuz i cant come when they feed\r\nOtzy: i mean 50% of all games are lost, i dont get why people have such toxic attitudes while losing\r\nOtzy: youll never enjoy this game\r\nOtzy: gg report garen plz&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-03-25T19:49:11.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Otzy,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=jET8wOEr,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-03-25T19:42:24.263+0000)\n> Otzy: you guys are feeding\n> Otzy: not if people keep trying to skirmish with 1/3 their cs\n> Otzy: definitely the guy whos 1/4, not 4/2\n> Otzy: 1/5*\n> Otzy: im just gonna mute all, you guys have no game sense\n> Otzy: garen just decided to afk -.-\n> Otzy: ik and my teams been flaming me all game cuz i cant come when they feed\n\nSo a 10-game chat restriction is the lowest penalty Riot has, and it's likely to tell you that reminding people how poorly they're doing, commenting negatively on their game sense, and accusing them of flaming/feeding isn't appropriate. Even if they ARE doing all those things, it just makes the environment worse when you talk about it like that.","replies":[{"poster":"Otzy","date":"2018-03-25T19:50:59.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i feel like if its in response to them asking me why we shouldnt fight its justified though. granted thats on my word and with no chat logs, so i guess take it for what its worth lol.\n\nI do agree with you though based on whats shown.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-03-25T19:52:45.982+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Otzy,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=jET8wOEr,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-03-25T19:50:59.444+0000)i feel like if its in response to them asking me why we shouldnt fight its justified though.\n\nObserve the two ways do do this, assuming the context is \"who will win.\"\n\n\"definitely the guy whos 1/4, not 4/2\"\n\n\"He's just too far ahead right now.\"\n\nThe former puts the onus on the ally being behind, and subtly implies their score is bad.

So is \"You can't fight him until you farm more.\" \"You're 1/4, stop fighting\" is equally blunt, but also belittling. You can be blunt and direct all day without belittling anyone else.","replies":[{"poster":"Otzy","date":"2018-03-25T21:11:29.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was honor level 4 before this, and get honored most games.
