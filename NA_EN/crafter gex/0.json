I fully understand your decision why you banned me, but I would appreciate it if you can hear me pit: I have been playing the game for a long time now. I looked over the reports you sent, and honestly, I am ashamed of myself, and I shouldn't have acted like this. I have been through tough days later; my friend died in a car accident where I also was sitting; therefore, I was angry and irritated about everything. I was trying to cheer myself up with playing the game. If you reinstate my account, I won't do that again, ever! The reason I want to continue playing the game is that my friend and I started playing the game at the same time, and some of the skins that he gifted it to me. I don't want them to be lost like this and my account to be deactivated. Once again, I sincerely apologize to the whole team of Riot, and I would appreciate it if you took this message into consideration.{{champion:29}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Upgrades","date":"2020-01-08T13:43:42.302+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a chance.

You had many chances to reform and now you want yet another. If you got one, what would be stopping you from breaking the rules once more and asking for _another_ chance? This is why Riot sets clear limits, and why your ban won't be lifted.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SweetRainTv","date":"2020-01-08T16:01:04.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Crafter GEX,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=QvYfuscG,comment-id=,timestamp=2020-01-08T11:05:00.242+0000)\n>\n> im  player from beta  legue of legends :) \n\nahhhh you sure?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kroda13","date":"2020-01-08T15:31:54.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot doesnt ban players for no reason","replies":[]},{"poster":"GreenKnight","date":"2020-01-08T11:14:00.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot doesn't unban accounts, unless it was their system that failed.\n\nYou can write to support, but there's almost no way of getting it back, i'm sorry to say.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crafter GEX","date":"2020-01-11T15:18:41.171+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think the reporting system is such that some of the reports are also unnecessary people do it for fun it's easy just click on the button , If the internet is gone My team did ff.and game is no longer available I got 9x report so I will get report no?\n\n\nAs I said, I am guilty and frankly tell you the situation.\n\nTake a look at my games and you'll see how many people were in the game that made this promise to report me.\nAnd your answer is to everyone and everything do Mute so what is the reason to play the game online?\n\n1)Why there is no commission to discuss this\n2)Gave me a chance yeah system chance,,,\n3) gave me a chance as a player who supports you so many years... nononono your answer was like ye we understand u  but go do new acc ) yes and its mostly works and I'm thinking it's easy to do someone bann than try to help him her...\n4) I just  asked for  1 chance to  The whole family riot and The answer was no\nI never used cheating programs Before that would happen the story i had  acc honorable  LVL 3.\n5)Great company and great  Riot family Should give chance to players who have been for so many years supporting.\n\n\n\n\n\n{{champion:142}}","replies":[]}]}
