It's hard to get banned for behavior like this on a first offence and it takes multiple games of consistent negativity, but when you've been punished multiple times like OP, a single game can trigger the next punishment. \n\n It's mainly done to crack down on repeat offenders and make it clear that the behavior is not tolerable.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GFREEMEN","date":"2018-12-29T23:20:50.872+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find it interesting that they perma ban people for shit talk but actual Inters can go on for years.

I'd like to clear this up now and remind you_ that your teammate's scores are not an excuse to act like this. _ Just because someone is trying to provoke you or is performing poorly doesn't give you the right to talk down to them. It's not fair, it's not right, and you wouldn't like it if it were done to you. There's no valid reason to act this way.\n\n [Asking for reports is considered player harassment according to Riot Support.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-) Asking for reports also accomplishes _nothing_ because 1 report is worth the same as 9. It doesn't accomplish anything and you're trying to say it in chat to get others to gang up on Karthus.\n\n Rank shaming is generally not tolerable, either. There's no need to put players down for performing at a different skill level than you. Are you a higher rank than them? Okay, well take pride in the fact that you're statistically better than them, don't use it to your advantage to belittle and invalidate them.\n\n The rest of it is just not acceptable. You just can't treat your teammates this way. I'm sorry, but this permanent ban was warranted after you disregarded the multiple chances you were given. I'd recommend taking a break to cool off from League and then if you feel ready, start up a new account with a clean slate. Good luck.","replies":[{"poster":"hi im Rizzuto","date":"2018-12-29T23:09:49.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as i said, i agree what i said was wrong, i just feel like i get more cursed down by people nowadays and i still see their account active. like alot of people.\n\nit just feels wrong to me. \n\nthanks. have a nice day.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"4G PnutCollida","date":"2018-12-29T22:37:58.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry bud.
