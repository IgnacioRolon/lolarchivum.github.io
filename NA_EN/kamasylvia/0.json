I found the song very interesting and appealing. It also fits Kindred very well. I use it for my studying and I was wondering if there are other songs with similar styles as this one.","replies":[{"poster":"Ed the Conqueror","date":"2016-01-24T23:04:59.683+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey SwaggDaddy,\n\nThanks for your interest in Kindred! \n\nI would say the closest thing to Kindred's style is Romantic music. Off the top of my head, I can't think of pieces with the same kind of techniques (I am not a pianist myself, so my knowledge of the repertoire isn't concentrated on piano technique), but there is plenty of stuff for you to chew on in the works of Rachmaninoff, early Scriabin, Prokofiev, etc. \n\nKindred isn't concert music and caters to the champion's story, and some of the more ambient moments of the piece echo the piano works of Ravel and Satie. \n\nOf course, I am in no way comparing my work on Kindred to that of the masters I just mentioned. I'm a padawan, they're Master Jedis.","replies":[{"poster":"Kamasylvia","date":"2016-01-25T03:05:12.246+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty so much for ur help.
