Even still, let's be 100% sure of what exactly is going wrong by running a trace for me. \n\nRun a quick traceroute to the EUNE servers at 31.186.224.42 and paste the results so I can take a look. (PLEASE be sure to block out the first line which shows your IP!!!!)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Butt Ρlug","date":"2018-01-14T22:05:01.444+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It must be a connection issue, on your side i guess.\nAre you using WiFi to connect ? if so change to ethernet, and check anything that could give you lag too, it might be related.\nThere are hundreds of possibilities for packet loss.","replies":[{"poster":"Awessome","date":"2018-01-14T22:09:56.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Im not sure it MUST be a problem with internet. I play on ethernet, 0% packet lost in other games or when i try to ping some websites, but in lol cant move like every 2-3 min for a while (everyone around move and i can see it)","replies":[{"poster":"Butt Ρlug","date":"2018-01-14T22:44:23.022+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you try to narrow down the issue ? like analyzing what packets goes through your network at that time ? (other computers/TV/any programs using internet/...)\n\nI had a similar issue before and i fixed it by fixing other connection issues.\nFIY you can use any computer with two ethernet ports as gateway for your all local network ( put it just behind your router ), that way you can see every single network packet going in/out of your LAN, might help narrowing the issue.\n\nDo you know for sure that it's only related to LoL ? Did you tried to run a ping for example, you launch it in a console in the background, for like 400/500 pings while you are experiencing this issue, to see if you loose packets here too, you can try a bunch of other ways too.\n\nIf everyone else move around and you can see it, maybe your firewall blocks some packets, maybe your router firewall does so ( maybe it let through incoming packets but don't send those who are supposed to be sent to LoL, might explain why you see them moving while you can't move ).","replies":[{"poster":"Awessome","date":"2018-01-14T23:01:18.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Firewall is OFF + i said already about pings, 0% lost packets even after 1000+.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-14T23:44:56.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wanted to check in on your troubleshooting as well even though you're not the OP. Have you been pinging *our* servers or just your ISP? Be sure to ping League's servers to see what your connection to League looks like specifically (EUW servers: 185.40.65.1).","replies":[{"poster":"Awessome","date":"2018-01-15T01:57:15.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I pinged random sites like google, youtube. I wanted to ping lol servers but i did not know them ip. Are you sure 185.40.65.1 isnt wrong ip?

That 100% packet loss basically just tells me that your network works a little differently when it does a ping test, which I'd need a little more info to go off of in this case. \n\nTell ya what, I don't want to keep going back and forth over hours time so go ahead and send this trace route data and some network logs over to our techs in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). They can look through those much deeper than I can here and should be able to get to the bottom of this with ya!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
