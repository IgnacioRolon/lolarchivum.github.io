I hope somebody will help. When i download LoL and open, in the middle of loading it shuts down. Then i open Riot file and i can see LOCKFILE. What is that? When i try to delete, after next LoL turn on, LOCKFILE will reappear in the folder again.... Now im really lost guys. When i will let LoL run, after 30min-1hour is the (buggsplatrc resoucrces not found) and (LoL Patcher program has stopped working) on my screen. I tried a lot of things like-run as a admin, compatibility, delete launcher but nothing worked for me... Maybe can help you- when i tried to find clients in project file, there were just LoL louncher and patcher, i dont have any clients, maybe thats the problem. Please help me.. you are my last chance...\r\n\r\nsorry for my english:D","replies":[{"poster":"chrisvj","date":"2016-10-16T18:36:50.822+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"lockfile is a file the client creates when it is run and should be deleted automatically when you close the client. It is how the client detected if it was already running (when you get the message \"Another instance of the launcher is running. Do you want to terminate it?\"). The error you are having is unrelated to this file. It sounds like you need to reinstall the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-15T18:22:07.122+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not familiar with the term LOCKFILE, but it makes some sense because when you are trying to open LoL, it needs permission from your PC to launch.  I recommend using the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) and following each step to make sure access is allowed!
