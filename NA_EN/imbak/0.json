I have a STABLE connection no matter how many times Riot wants to shift blame onto unstable wifi connections. I have high speed internet. No other game or streaming service is affected. \n\nEvery 4-5 minutes in game for the last 2 months (give or take) I get CRIPPLING LAG SPIKES. \n\nI have a ticket open and have posted in several other threads without getting ANY help with my problem. Please don't just refer me to the network troubleshooting guide, by now I've committed most of it to memory.\n\nI have lol logs, netalyzer, and dxdiag info at the ready for anybody that wants to help solve a month/s old issue myself and many other players are experiencing. \n\n","replies":[]}]}
