My team /remaked and i got 5 20 minute queues.  I thought it was just a small glitch or bug so i decided to wait the 20 minutes and tried to play again, but it did the same thing.  Might have 10, 20 minute queues.  Please Help Riot.  Do i still have to have the low priority queues?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-02T18:26:48.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you may be running Windows 10 with the Game DVR feature that was enabled by the anniversary update.
