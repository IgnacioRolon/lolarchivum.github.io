You know that big, voluptuous ball that Orianna magnetically controls? \nA pet shop Orianna would have one, obviously. But it would be a hamster inside of a hamster ball.\nShe&#039;d wear what looks like an apron, with a little name tag and a puppy face on it. She&#039;d look almost human, but not quite.\nHer hair? Looks like a pet shop employee I guess. With an animal hair clip.\n\nHer ult would be little hamsters running around in a circle and then absorbing into the ball.","replies":[{"poster":"Prince Royal","date":"2016-09-15T01:14:17.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"idk i think thats pretty crul to animols :////","replies":[{"poster":"Prince Royal","date":"2016-09-15T01:14:53.362+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Prince Royal,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=AKBlmyKz,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-09-15T01:14:17.698+0000)\n>\n> idk i think thats pretty crul to animols :////\n\n:)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Princess Royal","date":"2016-09-15T01:14:40.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-15T00:42:19.525+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A poro.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Emojay","date":"2016-09-15T00:41:57.641+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure.
