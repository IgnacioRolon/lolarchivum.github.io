I, myself, consider broken something like Kassadin, or Lee Sin, even Jax back a couple seasons. They had kits that made counter playing them almost impossible, and even if you did counter play them in lane, who is to say your team could do the same. Broken would be something were the whole team has to exhaust all amounts of energy, planning, or even champ selection against. Naturally. You have to think about it like this. . .\n\nAkali, while albeit, was strong with her Q-R-E-Q-AA combo, she is comparatively no where near that level of play. However, even with that combo, a decent ranged, mid to heavy weight fighter, or even a strong burst mage could counter play her, alone. Sometimes the help of a jungler was needed, but for the most part solo lanes is all that was needed to face her. (This of course based off your teammates performances) Now yes, I have faced against Akali, who rolled me by feeding off my teammates, however, these teammates also over extended themselves, put themselves out in the open, didn't pay attention, or maybe all of the above. Does that make her broken by feeding off of opportunity or does it make her broken for this?\n\nAt the end of the day, you can feed anyone by making yourself vulnerable to attack. Take for example Zyra, she is as slow as a plant, not used in mid anymore, and hardly has any life to sustain against a counter. However, if she gets fed of opportunity, does that mean she is broken or the person who uses her just exploits the openings others give up? Now a broken champ would be like Olaf at the start of season 3 were he would invade solo and kill you at your blue or red buff at level 1. There was no counter play, no way to avoid it, and you had no choice but to run. This led to people specifically picking champs out of their pools to fight him, banning him over other, more annoying champs, making changes to game plans just to avoid him, etc. \n\nIt's bad enough trying to fight against a decent ADC, even worse fighting against an ADC and a broken champ. Akali wasn't broken, she is now on the same field of play as when they nerfed Diana down to nothing. A team doesn't have to change they game play just because someone chose Akali, all that happens is more map awareness to avoid her in the dark. But then again, isn't that the point of her anyways, to always be in the shadows, waiting to exploit your mistakes? So, why would you nerf that anyways? Because it isn't fair that you or your teammates over extended themselves? Shouldn't that be punished? \n\nSo, with that being said. How was she broken? Also, we all know when making plays at a silver 2 and above, FPS becomes something of importance in the game play physics. A .5 delay in attack to a instant is same as comparing the speed of sound to the speed of light. Her ult, by the way, does not always reset her AA animation, specially if the target is smart enough to just plain old walk away, as her AA range is incredibly small considering the size factor of her weapons.\n\n(I am not taking into account people who only have bad experiences against her or just plain whining about it. I am speaking clearly as an adult addressing the situation as how I see it. I understand that she could face roll by going 24-4-17. However, I also know that, getting the most kills doesn't mean you win the match. She is not a hyper carry contrary to popular belief, as stated in this excerpt I found could give a pretty decent idea of how hyper carries work. \n\nA \"Hyper Carry\" by definition is someone that scales so well into Late Game, that he becomes unstoppable.\n\nIn LoL, there are no True Hyper Carries, due to the fact that all carries can be focused and shut down at some point, although if we look at Vayne, she can be defined as a \"Hard Carry\" (amongst others) due to the fact that she reaches a higher peak at end game (with her True Damage, which scales with ATK speed, which you can find on the common ADC items such as SotD and Phantom Dancer)\n\nThere are two exceptions, mainly due to the fact that a fed champion \"Can be shut down by CC\". This does not apply to Irelia and Olaf. Once one of these has an advantage in gold and levels (aka \"fed\"), they are very VERY hard to stop, mainly due to their damage output, tankiness, sustain, and immunity to CC.\n\nSo, conclusion:\n\nLoL has \"No Hyper Carries\" (Faceless Void waves Hello)\nLoL has several champions with a higher potential when fed. (Olaf, Irelia for example)\nLoL also has simple carries that naturally reach a higher peak at end-game than other, known as \"Hard Carries\" or \"Late Game Carries\". (Vayne, Kog'maw and others)\nAdditional details:\n\nDue to popular demand, I am now apparently forced to list the most dangerous champions to feed.\n\nIrelia - Heavy CC reduction, innate tankiness and regeneration, True damage. Very hard to stop after she has an advantage.\nOlaf - Short CC Immunity + tankiness buff, heavy True Damage on demand, very VERY tough once at an advantage (the less Current HP he has, the faster he attacks. The more MAX HP he has, the more damage he deals)\nFarm-carries: Nasus, Sion and Veigar - Long story short, they have good CC and an INFINITE stat potential due to the fact that their stats scale with their farm (Nasus Q Bonus Damage, Sion HP (with Atma's, AD as well), Veigar Ability Power)\n\nhttp://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/103463/what-defines-a-hyper-carry\n\nI found this on this webpage.)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Teralone","date":"2015-03-18T00:08:15.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"I'm fine with not getting an Akali facerolling on everyone every game...","replies":[]}]}
