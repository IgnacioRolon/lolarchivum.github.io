And when I pull my phone out, it&#039;s like they know to get right up to where the camera lens is and prepare for a photoshoot.\n\nSo uhhhh yeah! Say hello to Pervince (Pervy for short) and Reggie! They wanna say hi to you as well! Sorry for some of the pictures being a little blurry, they REALLY like attention and will get as close as they can.\n\nPervy is the bigger one on the left, and Reggie is the smaller one on the right.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Ks64R7h.jpg\n\nThey really do love to swim on over to me and just chill out. Sometimes I play with them. They act totally different when they want food so I know they love me.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/XpL1xak.jpg\n\nHere&#039;s Pervy up close. He&#039;s got some dark spots. That&#039;s normal, don&#039;t worry. Lil axolotl freckles.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/S2M36rO.jpg\n\nAnd here&#039;s a close-up of Reggie. He got WAY close when I tried to get a picture.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/WjDYDnK.jpg\n\nI dunno, I just thought I&#039;d share my pets for you guys, because...\n#... I really really like axolotls.\n\nFeel free to show off your pets as well!","replies":[]}
