You fight a couple guys, but then you have to escape from a crumbling temple that throws traps and minions at you by lasting 10 turns without getting destroyed. And you get cards just from buying it (regardless of whether or not you used money or gold, I believe), which is pretty legit.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s basically Indiana Jones and the Temple of Blizzard.\r\n\r\nPlus this is a card from the available ones. Best card in the game. Wisp has nuttin&#039; on dis.\r\n\r\nhttp://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/272/302/27225.gif","replies":[]}
