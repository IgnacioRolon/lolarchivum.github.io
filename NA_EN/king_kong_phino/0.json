I had just installed a major windows 10 update and got through champ select without a problem. Immediately on entering the loading screen, a youtube video I was watching started to stutter and around 5 seconds later , I alt-tabbed into the loading screen and my entire laptop froze completely and I was hearing a repeated clicking sound. I powered off the laptop manually. I restated my laptop very quickly and got back to the loading screen. This time, I made it into the game and saw that the in game time was 1:30. However, after 1 second of getting into the game, my laptop froze again and I heard another repeated clicking sound and my laptop was completely unresponsive so I powered it off again manually. I haven't attempted to start another game or reconnect to that one. I checked the name of the latest windows update and it is called: \"Security Update for Microsoft Windows (KB3176495). I am now in the process of running the login client as admin and attempting the repair available there. I'm not sure where to find the logs you might need but if you message me back with some instructions I can provide those too for you. Finally, I can just uninstall the latest update and I'm sure league would again work fine, but I would prefer to keep it, so I hope I can find a way to make both work.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Numerablepie","date":"2016-08-18T22:45:45.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok I had an issue like this, I clicked the ? on the launcher and launched the game as Admin and cleared something and the game started working just fine for me","replies":[]}]}
