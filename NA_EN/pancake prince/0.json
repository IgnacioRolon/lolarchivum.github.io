I tried to install it three times already and the same issue occurs. Any advice would be helpful, thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Pancake Prince","date":"2016-12-02T21:22:54.859+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I managed to get it installed, thank you so much!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-30T19:22:14.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"An unspecified error at that point in the process may suggest a security setting blocking your PC from scanning game files.
