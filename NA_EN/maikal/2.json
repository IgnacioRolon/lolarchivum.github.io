He needs his ult nerf reverted, that&#039;s it. The E nerf being reverted would make crit builds less awkward (Zeal items don&#039;t affect E) but I can see it causing problems in the future if on-hit/bruiser itemization gets out of hand again.\r\n\r\nDevourer junglers were fine before sated was released. When you had to nerf 2 champions that were balanced for 3 seasons {{champion:11}} {{champion:77}} , that should have been an indicator that you done fucked up somewhere.

Instead of just removing Satedness and bringing back the hard stacking, they kept Sated, found out that autoattackers are still broke with it, nerfed them around Sated, then figured that Sated was too crazy anyhow, removed the item, and now the autoattackers are nerfed into garbage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maikal","date":"2016-05-10T21:06:05.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The difference between sated and feral flare is that sated was much more snowbally, as it significantly increased the value of your other on hit items/scaling. The ridiculous cost efficiency of steraks/maw combo was also another oppressive factor that made snowballing an issue. Feral flare was far less of an issue in that regard. Strength wasn't the issue with sated. Yi was still hovering a 48 - 51% win rate after sated release, but bruiser itemization + a bug that made his double strike start proccing every 2 hits from phantom hit which was originally disabled for being too strong jumped that up to 51 - 53% which still wasn't the main issue. The main issue was it made him stupidly snowbally, more than ever before, and being 1 v 5 triple/quadra/penta killed by a 2 - 4 level higher Yi is very frustrating when it does happen, which resulted in his hatred/ban rate.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Captain Aishi","date":"2016-05-10T14:55:01.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I saw a 134 stack feral flare udyr once... who lost the game miserably because he was playing udyr into an anivia/alistar team","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2016-05-11T00:23:48.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is why the only Feral Flare junglers in competitive were Xin Zhao, Rengar and Nocturne, and Rengar was Lizard->Full tank half the time and used for the utility of his snare rather than for his burst since it was too risky building him damage.

Neither Yi nor Shyvana need AP ratios in the first place, and balancing them around a quirk of itemization, which makes no real immediate sense to them, is going to end up playing to their disadvantage if Guinsoo's ever receives AP-related changes.\n\nI think the main issue with Yi right now, as with most other melee damage-dealers, is that he dies too quickly when going for a damage build. Fixing his buggy Q could help him a lot, and potentially buffing his W damage mitigation could also help him clutch-block incoming attacks at the right times. Shyvana's abilities innately all scale with attack speed, so it's good of her to build the stat (she's probably the only champion who truly deserves to benefit from a tanky on-hit build), and she should be be able to stack Guinsoo's with her Q, but ultimately her problem right now is that her tanky damage fantasy doesn't sync that well with her build path (she's too squishy early and can't focus on dealing that much extra damage late). She needs a way to be a bit tankier while building damage items early, so maybe her passive could receive a buff to its early game numbers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2016-05-10T10:06:00.324+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or we could just fix his obnoxious Q bugs.

If your fed the game tends to become 'if you die your team loses'. If that's the case the correct call is to buy durability so you don't just die and give the enemy team a way back in.\n\nIf you're an item up as an ADC for example you should almost always use your advantage to buy a GA, BV or probably Merc since that item's broken.

It costs 3600 gold and doesn't utilize twin bites effect. By the time you manage to get the 6 stacks, you've either already won or lost. Making an item feel 'less bad' by compensating for a stat that the champion already doesn't utilize effectively is a Band-aid fix for a laceration. If they really want to make it a workable item on these champions, they need to allow abilities that double auto-attacks to apply 2x stacks for that item.\n\nNot that I think Shyvana needs all that much help in her current state. It is mostly just how bad she feels at the moment building the items she was meant to build (Bloodrazor, and Guinsoos apparently). The idea is to boost her on-hit because her E scales so well with AS and double-proc items. You can't really build her all tank because then she does no damage, but you can't build her all damage either because she doesn't have effective burst. You have to get 2-3 offensive items and go full tank afterwards in order to get the most out of her front-line, brawling, tank-shredding power.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MLDzXnRRR","date":"2016-05-10T08:13:46.693+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yi's Q is still bugged.","replies":[]},{"poster":"clement1213","date":"2016-05-10T01:55:43.148+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Agree, revert his R nerf.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-05-10T10:46:51.875+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I really like the shyvana AP ratio, mostly because I miss AP shyv...","replies":[]},{"poster":"folsomdsf","date":"2016-05-10T05:56:46.349+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"What's worse is that Shyvana has a non devourers build that is close to 50% winrate, cinderhulk.
