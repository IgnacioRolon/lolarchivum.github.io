Thornmail also isn't good unless you have health to back it up, so the scaling with armour is counter intuitive. It does way less damage, on top of how it already is reduced by magic resistance. Most lifesteal items will let you outheal it.","replies":[{"poster":"7ha7guy777","date":"2015-08-22T17:30:40.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you reduce crits by 50% pre Infinity edge, are they doing normal attack damage?","replies":[{"poster":"67chrome","date":"2015-08-22T19:04:56.640+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe so, that's how Yasou's passive treats critical strikes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lt Cuddles","date":"2015-08-22T22:29:45.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"67chrome","date":"2015-08-22T19:04:25.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Thornmail too weak Randuins unhealthy\n\nRanduins? Not going to argue that.\n\n10% reduced crit damage with 50% crit chance and 250% IE crits also means: 7.14% damage reduction, best-case scenario in a standard game. At the end of the game. Vs. 1 player. Assuming said player delivers 100% of their DPS in AA format rather than resorting to abilities or on-hit damage.\n\nCrit reduction is pretty much non-existent vs. the vast majority of champions in the game, only really racking up solid values vs. a very small crowd.\n----------\n\nAs for thornmail though?\n\nThornmail is largely unchanged vs. raw AD values vs. someone like Riven or Talon when they throw in an AA.\nWeaker vs. critical strikes and spellblades.\nStronger vs. on-hit effects. Or at least all on-hit effects that aren't spellblades.\n\nWhich means more reliable and more useful vs. a larger stretch of champions rather than specifically only good vs. a select few. And reliability > chance, so I'd say Thornmail got a buff. Rather than only being good vs. someone like Tryndamere, Rengar, or pre-rework Fiora: now it's relatively solid vs. anyone who auto-attacks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-08-22T18:42:58.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:22}} needs some buffs, {{item:3143}} really reduce in 10% damage on Ashe.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Angelofchaos16x","date":"2015-08-22T18:16:21.341+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"{{champion:90}} is 100% countered by {{item:3140}} ever since 2009 and guess what, we all survived.

But Ashe's crits are healthy, because they're not based on luck. However, Randuins unfairly counters Ashe harder than other crit based users as a result, because Ashe is dealing 10% reduced damage on _every hit._ as opposed to other crit based users who get reduced damage on every other hit or so. The fact that crits are physical damage means we already have \"some sort of defence\" against it, and always have: Armour and health. Specifically reducing critical strike damage is unhealthy when counters to it already exist, and this change counters a lot of champions unfairly. I won't go into your malzahar example because I think that the reason why the counterplay from QSS is fine is self explanatory and not comparable to this situation.","replies":[]}]}]}
