The only way get the stacks you used to is to snowball and get 2 stacks/champion, but devourer is a difficult item to snowball off of considering everything it lost in the first place. You also get far less gold off its passive because camps spawned twice as fast so you made use of the 30% gold increase twice as much.\n\n**How the 100 second jungle respawn timers ruin strategic diversity:**\n\nIf you (the balance team) want junglers to have different strengths and weaknesses associated with a play style of ganking, farming, and counter jungling, why would you make it so that the jungler who constantly farms barely gets ahead in cs of the jungler who constantly ganks? That's effectively what happens when you have 100 second respawns on jungle camps and anyone with a decent clear speed has time to clear their entire jungle _and_ gank. You just can't get a noticeable cs lead anymore unless you tax laners.\n\nStrategic diversity =/= tanks, 3 bruisers, and Nidalee since they all can clear the jungle and stay healthy enough to gank (and have strong ganks, as opposed to a traditional farm jungler like master yi who has very weak ganks due to no cc and low damage early game)\n\nSo.... Why was an item that was considered underpowered, (as it prevented jungler presence for your team early game and some of mid game) nerfed so hard?\n\n**tl;dr**\nThe root of the jungle problems lies in the issue that there is no reward for focusing on farming when other junglers can keep up in farm just as much and snowball themselves or their laners off ganks easily. In other words, there is no reward for picking a different play style, as there is only one play style that works in the jungle and that's farming everything and ganking everyone hard.\n\n**EDIT:**\nIt seems most people agree that a diversity of strategy and play styles is not a good thing if it means little interaction with other players. \n\nHowever, interacting with players via ganks on most devourer junglers guarantees little kill pressure unless the enemy was over extended so heavily and your laner has cc. Also, you would lose most 2 v 2s if the enemy jungler counterganks on a tank/bruiser.\n\nSo what if devourer was given a tool to increase gank pressure? I was thinking maybe after killing \"x\" large monsters the next champion you hit (or make it an active) will be rooted for x second(s) (could be a flat amount of monsters, or proportional to the stacks you aquire to make it weaker as the game progresses (although that'd be awkward because it'd also take more camps to charge the root as you gain stacks), it could even be a flat/proportional amount of stacks gained to gain root charges in team fights although that isn't what this buff is intended for, it's intended for ganking early and only that).\n\nThis would also make devourer jungler's ganks predictable if the enemy could see how many stacks they have, similar to an annie stun however, which could be good or bad depending on how strong the root would be.\n\n**tl;dr of edit:** give devourer an active/on hit passive to root a champion for x seconds, active's cooldown resets after killing x camps or gaining x stacks (flat amount or proportional to stacks for either option).\n\nThanks for discussing whether you agree or disagree :)","replies":[{"poster":"Strawberrycocoa","date":"2015-04-25T15:05:57.910+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":3,"body":"They've stated elsewhere that jungle farming needs to be held back because (A) a player being able to farm gold comparable to lanes uncontested and unmonitored leads to powerful champions getting fed really easily without any counterplay by the enemy and (2) Junglers need to be incentivized to gank and interact with other players.

Which is probably easier and more effective than the former.\n\nRegarding point B, while I don't disagree that you should be incentivized to gank, farm junglers really don't have the tools to gank. Warwick ganks pre  6 (or really pre flare, since that ult has like no base damage now) = lol, same thing for shyvana. Master yi ganks even post 6 are pretty sub par.

Shaco/Lee Sin/Rengar invades are threats for obvious reasons but other than that she can hold out against others (either escaping or duelling equally).\n\nBesides, maybe you forgot, when a \"gank\" is happening, it usually means a 1v2. I know tunnel vision OP but you might want to watch what your enemy laner is doing besides eyeballing the jungler. Not that easy to dunk if you're being chain CC'd by a Nautilus or if you died after you got knocked into range for a Riven Nuke Combo. Unless you're fed as hell to 1v2 of course, in which case no jungler can help at that point.\n\nBack on topic, I think they nerfed farmer junglers because tank junglers that brought CC to their ganks were weaker than a Devourer farmer that just bulldozed everyone at 20 mins if the laners just decided to play safe while he farms (the lanes remain equal while the jungler power is growing faster than the laners, safely too). \n\nI do believe they had the right idea though initially though, a farmer should be rewarded for farming fast to carry later, at the expense of early ganking power. The tank junglers had CC and good base damages for good early ganks that could snowball the lanes, they SHOULD pay for it with something else (i.e.  their clear speed sucking was perfectly reasonable in my opinion). But their clear was still too slow even considering that, and needed a buff, that I agree. However, they did receive a buff in the form of Cinderhulk, they clear reasonably fast, do respectable damage, are hard to kill, all while keeping their early ganking advantage over the Devourer farmers.\n\nMaybe it's time to buff Devourer again? I notice that it does not really increase clear speed that much, perhaps the increased damage vs monsters passive can be reintroduced in a certain form?

His ganks are really the only major redeeming factor about him. That and his plethora of CC to help lock down enemies. Shaco doesn't really have good sustain either, but nobody seems to complain about his jungling power. Udyr never really had great sustain in the jungle, but has pretty good ganks. Nobody complains about him. Where is this... absent group of junglers who do nothing but farm to increase in power? And don't you DARE say Master Yi... I hate that guy,","replies":[{"poster":"Maikal","date":"2015-04-26T07:08:48.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your comment is really strange...\nFirst: Nautilus and shaco have great sustain, especially shaco. Nautilus has a big shield, shaco has boxes and his E's passive to blind monsters. Udyrs that properly rotate turtle stance also have great sustain, but that can really just be done with blue buff.\n\nSecond: All those junglers you mentioned are out of meta.... because they aren't able to match the one play style of farming everything efficiently and having strong ganks nearly as well as the junglers we see most now. The only jungler out of those listed who does have potential to match that play style is a really good shaco, but shaco is also no where near as good in a team fight as tanks/bruisers who can initiate. Unless that shaco got fed and can assassinate the enemy team's carry (easily countered by a pink ward, so he most likely would have to resort to split pushing, call that strategic diversity if you'd like despite it not happening until 20 minutes). So why are you listing champions that have clearly defined inferiority because of the jungle changes to back up your argument that the jungle is diverse?\n\nThird: And how did all those contradictions of yourself lead up to the unrelated question of who the junglers are who do nothing but farm to increase power? Well: Warwick, Shyvana, Nocturne, Kayle, and master yi (hate him all you want, he's a champion nonetheless). The only devourer junglers with high sustain/clear times and early gank potential are Aatrox and Udyr, but Aatrox's sustain is very limited, as it tends to sustain him no higher than half hp due to the passive on his W. Udyr's ganks are sub par unless he catches someone out over extended. His bear stance move speed isn't much... so he has a lot less gank pressure on someone in the middle of a lane than a champion with a dash/blink and cc.\n\nApologies if I misunderstood any part of your comment, and thanks for your thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"Doctor Dyment","date":"2015-04-26T21:48:47.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems that we are on different though processes when it comes to jungle diversity, and I can see right now that we probably will never see what we are trying to show to each other.

If I sounded hostile, I never really meant to and I apologize if I did. But I've been through enough arguments like this to know that nothing will really change.

It's about rewarding certain junglers for their innate sustain and clear time abilities, and this part of Feral Flare is what made it really strong. Not many junglers can make use of 50% AS and on-hit magic damage better than they could make use of the stats on the other jungle items. It's a niche item now, and this is why Devourer is not chosen. It's not reliably good in a majority of situations.\n\nI also want to point out that it starts out with twenty five stacks, and you don't have to farm up to that point. This means that at 7 - 8 minutes, you have stats on an item that are very, very good. Feral Flare never had this, because most people got their upgrade at eleven minutes in a good game. The item is not that bad, and I use it regularly in the jungle with a fair amount of success.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maikal","date":"2015-05-10T13:40:56.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hard4Hamsters","date":"2015-04-27T09:09:08.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm thinking they should just revert the nerf to Devourer.
