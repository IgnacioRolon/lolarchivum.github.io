Update:\n\nThe existing system was designed to count games you watch *after* purchasing a team pass.    Say you watched TL versus TSM Week 1, then purchase a team pass.  The current system wouldn't count that game (even if you re-watch it) and would only count every game you watch *after*.  \n\nWe thought that would be a good design to reward early adopters, but have since changed directions - it's just plain confusing and you should get credit for your fandom even if you found out about Teampass / Fanpass after the launch.\n\nIf you're not seeing as much progress (I think that applies to everyone in this thread so far), no worries, we will be automatically re-processing and applying games you watched since the launch of Teampass / Fanpass.  \n\nGive us a couple weeks for your new progress to show up - we just started changing this code and want to make sure we get it right.","replies":[{"poster":"AgentX91","date":"2019-07-08T14:31:01.662+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Friday 7/5 Update: If you bought a team or fan pass after watching games for that team / league this split, you should now see progress for those games.

We're also thankful for your thoughts on the actual mission design.  We wanted to try something that felt more like a way to level up your fandom using classic game mechanics around leveling up.  Behind the scenes, it's actually working for you guys as designed.  The challenge is how we show you given how our user experience is set up, something we're very actively working on to correct in the coming days.\n\nStay tuned and look out for some additional posts and a dev blog or something like it on upgrades we are rolling out to make the quality of life easier for all of you who are supporting the teams out there!\n\nI also want to apologize on behalf of the team for making this way more confusing that it should be.  We owe you some improvements and we're committing to making them where we can as soon as we can.\n\nSee you on the Rift, friends.  {{summoner:7}}","replies":[{"poster":"Delite","date":"2019-06-28T03:50:36.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm so confused.

I believe I bought my Liquid team pass right at the start of the season before any games had been played, which should account for 10 matches by now, and I've only earned 8 pass rewards. Last weekend after MSI I noticed and rewatched all the VODs on a separate tab on mute and it still only shows 8. It sounds like you guys are working hard to improve this for the future, and I'm sure I'm just bugged, but it would help if there was a way to know what Vods have been watched. \n\nIf you can help I'd appreciate it!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jenevere","date":"2019-07-08T21:02:04.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been having the same problem. I've watched every single C9 game except the one from yesterday (mostly because i'm afraid I won't be able to complete the missions if it's not counting correctly), but my team pass is stuck at mission 3/8 and having only watched 2/3 games. We've had 10 games now, I've watched 9, and it should have completed mission 3/8 by now. I'm worried about actually  being able to complete the mission pass now because of how it is bugged. I understand how you guys wanted to reward early adopters and not let missions pile up that couldn't be completed yet, but the missions should be given to us as soon as we would be able to start on the next one. It's creating a problem where people are watching games that a mission isn't showing up for yet. Anyways, if someone could help me with why my mission is bugged, that would be great :) I don't want to keep missing my favorite team's games because I won't get credit for them if I do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Triggered Totoro","date":"2019-07-07T01:26:40.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is still going on.  I have watched the VODs, I can't get my rewards if it won't count when I watch the videos.  I don't dare purchase the arcade pass because I'm not dedicating the same time to the game I did before mostly because of how demoralizing it is to get online and find out that the team pass you paid for isn't rewarding your efforts.
