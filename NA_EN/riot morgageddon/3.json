You might have a more informed answer from the balance section of Boards. The best I can provide is that because you did in fact play top, you were increased in ranking due to where you were, instead of getting mid points for winning, when in fact you were in top lane.\n\nThink if you did that 100 times in a row, traded mid for top, your team won, and still your mid score kept on going up and up and up and up. When you finally got to play mid again, you could be rated significantly higher than you actually are, where you'd be unable to compete without having the skills for that MMR (again, assumptions. For all I know, you're the next Faker).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Swiff Swish","date":"2019-02-10T00:43:49.980+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also having a really hard time climbing in the new ranked system.

You can get an extreme amount of variance in skill from players because it's the very beginning and everything's getting sorted out, and for the end, players are charging towards personal goals, possibly doing riskier trades/champ selections because they need to get just one more promotion with only 3 days left.\n\nUsually, after a few patches, everything's settling down, and you should be playing against people who mathematically are where they should be in order to improve.","replies":[{"poster":"Grey Wolf","date":"2019-02-12T17:31:04.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But does Riot understand the problem with this?

Akali can't even use gunblade anymore after removing her heal entirely. Her Q with gunblade spellvamp is absolute garbage!
