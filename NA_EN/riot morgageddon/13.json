After a fix and eventual redeploy to the party system, we fixed the bug between intended functionality and not. Those who should be able to play together now are able to! \n\nGame reconnects and player drops due to network changes (2/23, ~43 minutes)\nAn early morning change to networking routes caused a spike in game re-connections and disconnects. After the change was rolled back, the spike disappeared. Said change will be reviewed and the problematic part fixed before being implemented.\n\n**Game Stuff: **\n\nNew articles not set correctly (2/11, ~14 minutes)\nMonday started, and a tired Draaaven felt only two articles were needed on the front page. After correcting him and showing that we can count beyond two axes, we fixed the front page and multiple articles appeared. \n\nStore cards not visible on front page (2/11, ~73 minutes)\nThe tired Draaaven also didn’t think it was worth showing deals to players either, since you only really need one type of axe ever. After a brief triage to see why that was the case, store cards were properly enable on the front page as well.\n\n**Player Support Trend:**\n\nA slightly higher than normal amount of error messages cropping up! We don’t see a root cause yet, so if you see issues with patching or from the patching screen, take a look [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/230673527) before contacting player support! \n\n**UPDATE:  For anyone reporting on issues that they are experiencing, please take  screen shots or videos of the issue you are experiencing .  If you don't have them, that is okay too, report it anyways.  Any visual evidence will help us a bunch :)**\n\nMorgageddon &amp; Couch Commando","replies":[{"poster":"Padoµch","date":"2019-02-15T10:00:28.714+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand you are split into team, working on different things, so here is the list of things I m looking forward to (even tho I honestly dont think it will happen).\n\nClient is a mess.

Please, dont make us suffer like this.\n\nMake classes useful in the way, you created them. -> I mean it like this: Support Janna shouldnt loose in the early game to support Zyra just because Zyra has so much dmg in that lane. Make it, so supports are determined with how much utility they provide to the adc, so people will not just pick full dmg supports. \n\nRemake the champs into their main role, into which they were created to be. Zyra was made as a mid controll mage, make her so she is there again. \n\nRemove spellthiefs edge. Lower dmg, lower healing, remake true dmg on champs. Now you have everyone taking dmg champs, because the dmg is too high. Make it so that people who are good at laning are still gonna be good, but not because they play some bursty champ top lane.\n\nMake tanks feel like tanks again. There is just too many options to counter resists and stacking HP. \n \nRemove CS gold bounties completely. \n\nIncrease jungle camp exp, and gold, so that farming jungler are still playable against ganking junglers. Decrease the time for which the scuttle crab provides vision.

When starting up the client, my CPU usage jumps straight up (i5-4460). So I have to wait till the client loads to do anything :). I understand that the anticheat scans all my processes, but srsly. \n2. When opening tabs (mostly crafting) it just stays black, and I have to click on another tab and back to get it open, sometimes even 2-3 times.\n3. I understand that I got a new skin from crafting/new emote from the box, but seriously I have to see the notification (7) times, (7) times to click on that skin/emote for it to understand that I know its there?\n4. Having client cut from the game itself causes issues, like bugsplats, the game is now opening etc. The best thing is when you get packet loss when the game tries to load (not even getting to the window) - it will just tell you that you have no internet connection for like 3 minutes.\n5. The pre game lobby - the client changing my summs at it wants (ghost cleanse, ghost heal). \n6. Poeple cannot ban in ranked, causing them to get LB (Unexpected error)\n\nBetween us, the client feels really unpolished. Paragon in Alpha testing had a better client, but as I said, those games have it full screen, the whole program running. The main issue everybody has is that its slow, and taking a lot of resources from the pc itself. But yea, that is caused by optimization.\n\n\nI just thought of a question I would like to ask. Why can I still get champ shards from lootboxes, when I already have all champs and 225k BE? :). There is nothing I can use it to. I dont want emotes, I dont want ward skins, not even champ lvls (because they tell you nothing about the player).","replies":[{"poster":"Revive Aatrox","date":"2019-02-20T17:17:00.712+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"''2- When opening tabs (mostly crafting) it just stays black, and I have to click on another tab and back to get it open, sometimes even 2-3 times.

The impact of the bug is considered not terrible enough to warrant fixing the bug and delaying the cycle, so it's a 'known shippable' and usually fixed the following patch. However, sometimes bugs can remain 'known shippable' until other dependencies are fixed. It's not great, but it's what's needed to prioritize bugs.","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2019-02-20T00:04:54.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Understood.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ReGaM 01","date":"2019-02-19T16:03:28.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"King Braum","date":"2019-02-19T22:35:49.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont advertise your content in people's discussions.
