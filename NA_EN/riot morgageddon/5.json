Investigation leads to a download node not sending data correctly. Before 3rd party vendor can investigate said node, the node self-recovers and failure rates lower to normal levels. \r\n\r\n**Game Stuff: **\r\n\r\n* **Wrong F2P Schedule (4/16, ~2 hours)** F2P rotation for the week rolls out, with Evelynn free instead of Vel’Koz. The Agony’s Embrace will have to wait a little bit before being able to hug everyone, and instead we’re all being watched by the Eye of the Void. He doesn’t blink much. \r\n\r\n**Player Support Issues:**\r\n\r\nThere’s a pretty stable amount of similar problems across the board in Player Support. We are also launching the new League Patcher, which should improve a bunch of things, as well as prevent you from needing to allow League through your firewall with each patch! Read about it [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015621174-New-League-patcher) and if you want to adjust your firewall one or two final times for the client, look [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3)\r\n\r\nMorgageddon &amp; Couch Commando","replies":[{"poster":"IdrakoKagesisbak","date":"2019-04-21T23:47:38.615+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"anyone know a solution to my game randomly pauseing for 1-3 seconds and my ping jumping from 50 to 350 then going right back down?

It sounds like either something is connecting/disconnecting, or you've got a process/program that's lagging you out occasionally.","replies":[{"poster":"DangoX3","date":"2019-04-22T07:15:48.671+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ye this keeps happening to me and my friend.

Wifi was designed for convenience and not gaming. If your desktop is 5g capable you can try that otherwise you wither want a hardline Ethernet connection or a powerline Ethernet adapter.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Morgageddon","date":"2019-04-22T20:22:30.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IdrakoKagesisbak,realm=NA,application-id=6WpmgL9O,discussion-id=rlVTLzLH,comment-id=00020000000100000000,timestamp=2019-04-22T19:54:59.184+0000)\n>\n> I play desktop wifi.
