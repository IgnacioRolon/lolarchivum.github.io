(Moved to Mondays for easier updates)_\r\n\r\nWe’re seeing some exciting Worlds matches, Clash testing is always fun, and 9.20 is right on the horizon!\r\n\r\n**Follow-Ups:**\r\n\r\n* **Mac voice still not working properly** Bug grouped with other Mac bugs\r\n\r\n**Ongoing**\r\n\r\n* **Transfer service goes down(9/21)** PS notifies the NOC that players are getting errors when attempting to transfer between Europe and Oceania (Not 100% failure rate, but not 0% either). A JIRA ticket is made to track the problem, and teams are assigning resources appropriately during the upcoming sprint. \r\n\r\n* **TFT Match History intermittent(9/26)** TFT match history goes live on all regions, and reports start to filter in over the next day that TFT matches aren’t always showing up in match history. A code fix is discovered, but Live Production does not deem it high enough of a problem to warrant a hotfix just for it. The fix is slated to roll out with patch 9.20. \r\n\r\n**Server Stuff: **\r\n\r\n* **Automated Monitoring notices error increases(9/19, ~9 minutes)** Automated monitoring notices errors exceeding acceptable levels for logons. Before any need for investigation, the errors decrease back to acceptable levels. \r\n\r\n* **Match History fails to load after 9.19(9/25, ~58 minutes)** Platform opens after the 9.19 patch, but match history is failing to load. A micropatch rolls out shortly afterwards to update the server config for match history, fixing the problem. \r\n\r\n* **Issue with Pro View pass not giving item appropriately. (9/26, ~5 days)** A patch rolls out for pro view, and reports drift in that purchases are failing, but RP is still being charged. Pro view and team bundles are disabled while store and dev teams investigate. A fix is tested on PBE and then pushed to TR before rolling out to the remaining Riot realms. \r\n\r\n* **Automated Monitoring notices Reconnect Spikes. (9/29, ~90 minutes)** Automated monitoring notices game reconnects are spiking. Investigations from network teams identify a networking card issue on a specific server. Network engineers properly route traffic away from the failed network card, and a scheduled replacement task is created for the next time that server case is open for maintenance. \r\n\r\n**Game Stuff: **\r\n\r\n* **TFT ranked disabled due to bugs(9/25, ~36 hours)** The NOC is informed by game teams that TFT ranked needs to be disabled. Live Production teams start triaging the associated issues, testing on both internal realms as a micropatch is prepared. After the bug fixes are verified, the micropatch goes out and ranked is turned back on. \r\n\r\n_Morgageddon_","replies":[{"poster":"Aatrox Airlines","date":"2019-10-13T14:21:39.096+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Automated Monitoring notices Reconnect Spikes.

That server being disabled slightly lowers the overall capacity of games to host for that particular region. If we drop from say 100 game servers to 99, we've really only lost 1% of possible hosting power for games, which shouldn't cause any problems realistically speaking while we wait for the maintenance cycle.\n\nNow let's say it's a single server dedicated to network traffic as part of our Riot Direct system. If we only have say, four of those, losing 1 would be a 25% reduction in processing capability for properly routing traffic. That could be disastrous depending on how much traffic there is at any given moment, and whether that system is operating close to or at capacity.\n\nEverything doesn't have uniform server numbers or resources. We don't get to have 100 game servers, 100 network routing blades, 100 store processing servers, etc. So, depending on which area a single piece of hardware goes down, it could actually be pretty impactful (in a negative way) to players!\n\nDoes that help?","replies":[{"poster":"Aatrox Airlines","date":"2019-10-17T09:20:16.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the insight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IlKerrylI","date":"2019-10-20T03:19:40.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"can u answer this why there are trolls that not getting ban in rank games","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ONI BB","date":"2019-10-09T03:25:49.640+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"not sure if this is the right place seems clash once again broke something with AT&amp;T isp again ping is about 80-90ms higher than normal.","replies":[{"poster":"ßàßà ñasty","date":"2019-10-09T05:29:18.526+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same issue and it seems to be on Riots end because everyone with at&amp;t isp are having problems with ping.\n\nI hope they fix whatever is wrong soon.\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Morgageddon","date":"2019-10-09T18:37:19.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ßàßà ñasty,realm=NA,application-id=6WpmgL9O,discussion-id=sfpl9xRH,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-10-09T05:29:18.526+0000)\n>\n> I have the same issue and it seems to be on Riots end because everyone with at&amp;t isp are having problems with ping.\n> \n> I hope they fix whatever is wrong soon.\n> {{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}\n\nA new peering connection between Riot Direct and AT&amp;T finished earlier this morning.
