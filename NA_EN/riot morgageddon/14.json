We’ve got a fresh new patch incoming, start of the new season, and a bunch of “It’s 2020 where’s new news riot” memes as well.  \r\n\r\n**Follow-Ups:**\r\n\r\n* **Mac voice still not working properly** Bug grouped with other Mac bugs. More .plist fun (No progress since last check).\r\n\r\n**Ongoing**\r\n\r\n* **None**\r\n\r\n**Server Stuff: **\r\n\r\n* **Custom Player game minimum set to 10(12/15, ~92 minutes)** NOC is notified by automated alerting that CPU usage across game servers is approaching warning limits. To ensure the limit isn’t exceeded, the NOC sets custom games to a minimum of 10 players, alleviating the load slightly. Once the CPU usage falls back to normal levels, the NOC re-enables practice tool and removes all ticker updates.\r\n\r\n* **CPU Mitigation Steps(12/15, ~92 minutes)** Reports filter in that the CPU usage is above the ideal threshold. In response, the NOC disables the practice tool, sets minimum custom players to 10 per game, and starts throttling non-ranked queues. Once the CPU usage falls below the red line, the NOC returns all queues to normal. \r\n\r\n**Game Stuff: **\r\n\r\n* **TFT Elemental Pass rewards 10 and 11 disappeared from TFT Tab(12/30, ~13 hours)** Player Support notifies the NOC about reports regarding battlepass 10 and 11 not being available for TFT. Escalation and notification of the appropriate team finds the missions were set to expire at the wrong time. The missions are changed to expire appropriately, fixing the problem.\r\n\r\n_Morgageddon_","replies":[{"poster":"Dotty LB","date":"2020-01-10T11:02:41.973+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Client has far more issues than whats listed here and its so bad that playing ranked right now can me a huge liability.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hRnrBbWoTr","date":"2020-01-14T07:08:10.730+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Fix your fucking client.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChrisBrownze","date":"2020-01-07T13:03:54.449+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where are all the client  bugs???

If that bug first showed up here during this period, and was internally tracked, it'd be up there. It could be that the specific bug you're thinking of already exists and is being tracked or worked on, or isn't in the database. Could be old enough it's been tracked for a while, or lumped in with other client impacting bugs. \n\nUnfortunately, I'm not assigned to any team that actually edits code (client, game, etc). I can raise visibility around issues seen and unseen though.","replies":[{"poster":"tourgai13","date":"2020-01-11T16:48:46.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"****","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wyraw","date":"2020-01-20T10:14:27.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"blind fuck","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"S Tier Waifu","date":"2020-01-10T17:54:40.512+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol not a mention of the client issues, yet there are thousands of posts about it on the forums...delusional","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarknesTheDragon","date":"2020-01-09T09:03:42.747+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"all this about cpu are you talking about peoples processor's overheating?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Morgageddon","date":"2020-01-10T00:48:53.555+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DarknesTheDragon,realm=NA,application-id=6WpmgL9O,discussion-id=nfToEEPG,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2020-01-09T09:03:42.747+0000)\n>\n> all this about cpu are you talking about peoples processor's overheating?\n\nServer CPU!
