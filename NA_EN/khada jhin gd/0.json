Ezreal, Lucian and Kha'Zix are all similar in this way.\n\nIsolation is Kha'Zix's thing. Slapping the same type of mechanic onto another champion just makes both characters less unique and more bland.\n\n10% missing hp physical damage is a boatload of extra damage onto an enemy, especially since Talon will typically do his jump, q, w, ult or ult, w. This usually almost always overkills the champions he is going for which are squishy supports or carry champions with little health. Since his primary targets are squishies and he usually overkills them anyways, this type of 10% execution damage would overkill even more, if not, it would almost certainly grant him a kill. \n\nIf I was Riot I'd look to create a Passive that rewards him for killing people. In his lore it pretty much states that he was a robber and got in and out quickly. It's similar to his playstyle. E in = getting in quickly. Q and W= slow the enemy down. Finally, R= deal a ton of damage quickly and the bonus movement speed lets him get out quickly.\n\nThe passive needs to support his in and out playstyle.","replies":[{"poster":"Junkο","date":"2016-07-08T08:37:13.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Slapping the same type of mechanic onto another champion just makes both characters less unique and more bland.\n\nIkr.

(No one cares about the pitiful slow added to it while Rylai's is a core item.)\nPassive = tick damage nerfed. \n\nFor Brand to deal close to the same damage as before, he has to proc the new gimmick. That aspect about him doesn't feel good. Especially the fact that Riot doesn't even realize that all it takes is one MR item to make a mage no better than a CC support. \nI recently played against a Zed as Malzahar who rushed Maw. I could barely do any damage to Zed. Even with me having Seeker's, he still did more damage because AD > AP.\n\nAs someone who plays Brand (and Malzahar) often, it's painful to see mages who were just fine pre-MYMU be ruined by overnerfing (\"_New gimmicks are scary! I don't know how to buy MR! WAHHH!_\"), all the while some marks(wo)men also get new gimmicks, but instead of nerfs get a boatload of buffs, kit-wise and item-wise.

AD champions can do anything AP champions can, and usually better at that. Riot secretly hates cooldown-based gameplay and therefore wants AD champions to always shine the brightest because they **all** have inherent right-click power + flashy skills + tons of mobility if they get Black Cleaver. AP champions just have flashy skills. Right-clicking has no real cooldown and always has relevance in damage on **all** AD champions. That leads to more action and excitement in the LCS. It's not exciting waiting on mages with their cooldowns.\n\nWhy do you think marks(wo)men got such a sweet deal when they had their big update, while the affected mages got unwanted gimmicks and nerfs to kits and items?\n\nWhy do you think they want {{champion:268}} to remain strong while nerfing {{champion:90}} into the ground? Azir is a right-clicker for the mid lane. He consistently provides action. Malzahar is hindered by cooldowns (and high mana costs). Not exciting. \nSure, Azir has been nerfed a bit since then, but noticed how he was left out of the MYMU? Azir is what Riot wants with their mages. Despite the nerfs, he's still incredibly strong. Meanwhile, they want to reduce Malzahar's basic attack range to 500 (wtf?) and nerf his MS. \n\nA champion with **0 mobility and 0 disengage** needs to have much less MS than {{champion:64}}'s 350. \n\nThe message from Riot is right there, clear to see. Malzahar's MS is already low, **all things considered**, but _apparently_ not enough. The saddest part about all of it is he's not getting any compensation buffs from it, like having his Q and E actually do damage again.\n\nBut sure, let's keep whining about {{champion:45}} ulting one target for 500 damage every ~70 seconds while {{champion:51}} crits for more than 1k damage every second + the occasional Shiv/Firecannon proc damage without expending any mana and healing 100+ health each attack.\n\nAnything else that needs to be covered?","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2016-07-08T11:41:24.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uh, nope.
