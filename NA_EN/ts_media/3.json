You just can&#039;t satisfy your customer base, can you? Haha, we had the same problems too. We answered our communities beck and  call; made the game easier, updated the graphic and every iteration was only more complaints.\r\n\r\nSo we decided to spruce up our game far beyond what our customers wanted! Above and beyond, right? We had millions online at a time! Even with people leaving bit by bit with each update, it wasn&#039;t too bad. \r\n\r\nWe surprised them with a brand new runsecape in the end! Combat evovled! We took our pride and joy and completely butchered it. The community loved it! We woke up one day and saw our millions had turned into a few hundred thousand. Soon, we were struggling to even get a hundred thousand on at a time! Man were we stumped.  \r\n\r\n\r\nEach update after that was a complete flop. Anywho, our community is separated now, and while not perfect and as bustling as it once was, everything is going pretty smoothly. This was after we added back the 07 style rs. Some old schoolers came back, more newer ones are now enjoying the game again too.\r\n\r\nWell, we&#039;re only writing this letter to give you an early advisement status! Better get cracking on that old school league server. It&#039;s gonna be needed pretty soon!\r\n\r\nYour best friend,\r\n\r\nJaget&quot;\r\n\r\nPsst, just my lil take rito... I think a majority of us would looovvveee an old school server right before that juggernaut patch. Give the keys to morello and let him hire his own staff. Just me on this one.\r\n\r\n*Note*: Used a parody name for legal issues. Its just a joke  boiss.... mostly.... them servers though, rito... seriously.","replies":[{"poster":"DNFVixen","date":"2018-04-30T07:59:46.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TS Media,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=UfUT0Jtv,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-04-30T06:02:29.848+0000)\n>\n> &amp;quot;Dear Riot Games,\n> \n> It seems you screwed up as bad as we did.
