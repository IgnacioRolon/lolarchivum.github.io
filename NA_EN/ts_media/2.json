You cant botch rene Q or W and E is REALLY hard to botch but you can botch yas Q(even the normal q without nado which has the width of a hair) or W and for w you need to be walking one side to the other while doing everything else.","replies":[{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2018-05-09T06:25:39.593+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"I am silver/gold.

There is nothing complicated about it.\n\nIf you compare them, you have to compare how hard it is to play either at the same level, not yasuo \"using his kit\" vs Rene \"doing every single aa cancel and movement correctly\". With yasuo you have to auto between each spell too by that logic to maximise your dps.And how punishing is it if you do 1 less auto compared to if you miss your nado and then cannot ult for another like 6-7 seconds? Ofcourse if you mean at challenger level all champions' skill requirements are not that far apart. But as a non toplaner, everytime i get autofilled top I just lock in Rene and never ever feed. Sure I might not carry but the difference between navigating a lane as Rene and as Yasuo is abysmal.\nAlso you can never hit an enemy with your Q if they have the smallest amount of skill at dodging and are not CCd by a teammate prior to the nado.\nPS: I don't believe you can be gold by one-tricking riven and doing aa cancels and all the combos you mentioned earlier. I have 2 pals that even miss the aa cancels a lot compared to Box Box or Adrian and they still are easily plat 1-dia V.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TEA Nietzsche ","date":"2018-05-09T12:40:15.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think you could do [this ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Jw7521fH3I)reliably if even at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2018-05-09T14:16:32.404+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mean this??\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMlh2AlRhCA&feature=youtu.be\n\nI dont know if he is spaming taunt to make his model spazz like it does in your vid.

If you don't have sufficient skill on the champions to carry you through the early game, REFRAIN from picking them in ranked games please. Go train 100 games of normals on them before blindly picking the a champ thinking he'll be an \"easy\" win. You're only deluding yourself and setting your team at an inherent disadvantage.\n\nYou see the difference? this is an universal problem, it is not a Yasuo-only problem, hence why i can't take the OP serious and just see this as another circlejerk post.\n\nEDIT : nvm i fucked up, im delusional sorry, don't take this serious anymore, realized that what i wrote down is dumb as fuck ehhh","replies":[{"poster":"Gebba","date":"2018-05-09T13:42:23.711+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"- What was his own point he actually missed? I actually didn't catch that. I also don't think it means you can't miss it just because he did. You would be making the point against the point he missed, which means you still hit. If he did miss it, i still cleared up what he meant to say, more like repeated it. It's really obvious (to me) what the OP's statement is.\n\n- It is not an exception to Yasuo, but it was neither stated as an absolute. You're basically using a ''not all'' argument but swapped to ''not only''. He uses Yasuo because Yasuo is incredibly likely to be interpreted as the ''free elo pick'' currently, i assume. You could name any other champ, but that's whataboutism.\n\n- Idunno, third paragraph just isn't very relevant. I understand how you're thinking and why you bring it up, but it's trivial. It's like a metafallacy. You're shooting the message because the messenger is stupid, the saying goes. OP could be playing devil's advocate, but it doesn't refute his statement in any way shape or form. It stands as it is, you can swap Yasuo with some other champion, but OP chose Yasuo and probably not for no reason. Name another champ if you want, but then we're back to whataboutism.\n\n- I think people play ranked games to try and climb to a rank or get better, not because they ''do not want to be told what to do''. Also, you can actually look up your teammate's stats during champ select and know for a fact what they main. If they don't main Yasuo and never touched him in ranked, and didn't play him in their last 20 matches, maybe you should tell your ranked mates not to pick Yasuo- For your own sake AND theirs- Or dodge. Again, nobody can tell you what to do, just like you won't stop an inter from running it down mid by saying ''stop''. Point being, yes he can know when people are unlikely to know how to play the champ they want to choose. There's two websites that i knew of (I forgot the names sadly cuz i dont use them) which lets you see your teammates' stats with the click of a button during champ select. A lot of youtubers/streamers use it when smurfing, you may have noticed them dodging because of it. I don't even think this is relevant to OP either, he probably doesn't do it himself, but i'm entertaining the notion.\n\n- He is not making the post you presume to be the correct way of addressing the issue because OP finds Yasuo more relevant than saying ''freelo champs''. I see the difference, but they're both saying the exact same thing. It still is the exact same message. You can word it violently or you can word it kindly, you can word it using specifics or you can word it using general terms. It's the same message, but what you did was wordsmithing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TS Media","date":"2018-05-09T13:29:45.843+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://imgur.com/aumdHlO\nhttps://imgur.com/ic2BvD2\nhttps://imgur.com/mDdUz4V\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice the trend of games I've lost? \n\nAnd the account isn't a \"smurf\".
