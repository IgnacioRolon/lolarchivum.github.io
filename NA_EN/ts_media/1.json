I'll keep that in mind next time pantheon and zac are jumping in the back line after me, with the enemy team blowing their locket and redemption while I have a lux in the back chucking out Es providing absolutely nothing for the team. Except building AP. Zyra has way more early game pressure than lux and does well without items. Lux really doesn't. Her shield is weak and her poke damage is ass.\n\nWhen thresh just walks up and zones me from CS while I had the lux support sitting there chucking E's, I'll remember that she's doing her job. It's MY fault I'm getting zoned out by the enemy support after all.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SoundChaosDebug","date":"2018-02-12T23:45:07.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just checkin' in onya","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-02-12T23:56:54.034+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You hope the lux is actually good instead of trash that queued mid/sup, starts dorans ring, uses elementalist and cant hit shit to save their life, also never shields and never angles the return shield over you.","replies":[{"poster":"D3m37r1","date":"2018-02-13T00:51:19.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's basically every lux supp.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-02-12T23:45:32.601+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How can Lux not peel when she has a root on a fairly low CD, as well as a large slow field?\n\nAdditionally, it is not the supports job to body block you.
