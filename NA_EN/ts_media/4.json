Doesnt look like trolling. Just bad decisionmaking. And no, it doesnt even REMOTELY look like he is \"obviously boosted\". You have to watch him in many games to determine that. Perhaps he was lagging. Or getting BJ under table. Or he had family pestering him so he couldnt play.  There are hundreds of factors. Also reason he didnt use abilities is cuz he knows Morgana will black shield it so its waste of mana.","replies":[{"poster":"TS Media","date":"2018-04-22T23:46:41.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't matter if she blackshields.

Black shield CD is almost 30 seconds rank 1. To top it off, he had attempted to turn that fight by hooking or fighting back we had a higher chance of actually winning that and turning that into a pretty decent trade. We even blew heal earlier into the game so we were up heal advantage.\n\nSo if he's a decent player, as you claim, then he's obviously trolling. There's 100 reasons to show that he's boosted in this one clip alone. One of those reasons include us WATCHING her walk into the bush in the first place. I could show the entire laning phase and show you what he did.","replies":[{"poster":"KlydeFrog","date":"2018-04-24T17:24:35.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean I played against a katarina when I was in bronze still lol she raped us didn't type anything during or after match .
