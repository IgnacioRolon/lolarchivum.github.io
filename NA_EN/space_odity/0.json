Why?\n1. He&#039;s got that Lucious Malfoy look, _and you **can&#039;t** deny it                 _                                                          **/ +blondie**\n2.

In his splashart he looks like he has blonde hair (plus some gray hair but y&#039;know he&#039;s getting old and he&#039;s currently in like mid-40s or something like that I believe) which is also the case (kinda) when it comes to his skins (**EXCEPT FOR THE BILGEWATER ONE (5) **)   ** /  +blondie**\n4.
