There can also be a number of local network settings that can exacerbate the issue, so I recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a first step in resolving this.\n\nLet me know if you notice any change after working through those steps.","replies":[{"poster":"mofohamjam","date":"2016-08-14T20:47:59.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've went through all of it and my ping has went from 400 to 550 and doesn't drop below 500 anymore no matter what i try","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-15T15:30:28.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like the issue is most likely along your route to the server, then. We can take an in-depth look at your routing if you run a traceroute log. I recommend completing this using the [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net) application. After launching the app, plug in the IP address 185.40.65.1 and run a trace for 5 minutes. After you've hit that time, export your results as text and paste them here. Don't worry, your traceroute doesn't include your real IP address, so you don't run any risks doing this.\n\nI'll be happy to take a look at your route and see where the issues may lie. Let me know if you any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SaxonElektric","date":"2016-08-14T21:43:32.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im having the exact same issue, for the past few days now. Ping is consistently at 300 or above. Ive tried every home remedy i can think of, reinstalled the client twice, dns flushing, contacted my isp (virgin media) and everything is fine on their end. Everything else works fine, its just league. Then earlier tonight when they had issues with logging into chat, it got worse because now it never connects for me, so i tried everything again, reinstalled and still, high ping and refusing to log into chat.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
