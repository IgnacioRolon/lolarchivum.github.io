Eventually, of course, given Riot Time, but they've said they wanted to do it since...late S3, I think?\n\nWhen bruisers are dominantly strong, you have the exact opposite problem; there's no point in playing a ranged ADC or a squishy mage when a brusier can be 10 times tankier than you are and do equivalent damage. Riot needs to rework either a bunch of champions or how the game works in order to get the melee/ranged in equal parity.","replies":[{"poster":"kaykalos","date":"2014-11-17T23:47:21.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Range is defensive aspect, if riot dont understand that, then they dont understand why bruisers must be tankier than squishy and do equivalent damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-11-18T00:05:37.211+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That'd be a better argument if most bruisers didn't have a gapcloser and some form of CC, which is the primary problem with them as a class.

Of course, this leads to champions who are early game powerhouse lane bullies that scale hard into the late game (hello {{champion:13}}).\n\nSo unfortunatley we're at this stage where it's either bruisers are outclassed by every other class, or it's the League of Bruisers.  Riot said they're reworking bruiser itemization, but nothing really concrete has shown up.  Until that happens, expect to see Pantheon the god of top lane, or completely obscure, never in that sweet spot of just right (TBH, I wouldn't say that any champ in this game is balanced, they're either OP or UP to varying scales.)","replies":[{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2014-11-17T17:58:29.568+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> History of LoL shows that Bruisers have been a big pain in the ass top lane.

I mean, it's natural for there to be ebbs and flows and balance.  This specific timing definitely isn't preordained.\n\nThe way it seems to work is that Riot tries to reshape problem points in their game every winter.  That reshaping typically is looking at three areas of the game:\n1. Support isn't fun / can't buy items / ward burden\n2. Early junglers too influential / farming jungle not sufficiently rewarding / only a few viable junglers\n3. Top lane is stupid / melee-ranged interactions\n\nSo far, the only one of these they've gotten to feel pretty good is #1, and that took two seasons to get it right.  They're coming after #2 harder than ever in preseason 5, and who knows, maybe that'll work.  #3 is borderline unsolvable, and that's the one that always gets us into trouble on this topic.\n\nIn any case, what tends to happen is that Riot overshoots the mark on whatever fixes they're trying to make to the game.  In season 3, they wanted to move from a resistance-based tanking to a health-based tanking.  That was a success, but suddenly the first guy to buy a Giant's Belt was crushing top lane and the League of Warmog's was on.  Since bruisers tend to be the most broken thing about the game at any given time, it's only natural that we're trying to fix them every winter, so given this overshooting tendency in their attempts to fix things, it's not too surprising that bruisers come out overtuned every time their itemization gets tweaked.\n\nThat's my best guess for why the timing is as it is.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2014-11-17T07:36:17.835+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"We'll just have to see what season five brings to the table.\nBruisers have always been deceptively strong.
