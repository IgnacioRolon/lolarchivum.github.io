Warwick, right now, is an absolute monster.  However, this is also the first real play that he is getting on a large scale besides a few very dedicated players since S2.  Believe me, I get that he needs a nerf, hes at a 90% ban ratio and a 60% win ratio.\r\n\r\nBut they are sending him back to oblivion with the upcoming PBE nerfs.  W duration reduced to 6 from 10 seconds, ult losing 100 damage at rank 1, 85 at rank 2 and 70 at rank 3.\r\n\r\nSkirmishers is already getting changed so that he can't use it, but those changes aren't even on live and your going to hit Warwick again.  His ult is going to be useless until he gets an on-hit item, so bye bye CDR tankwick.   He is going to go from the most banned/picked champ to one of the least again in just one patch.  And most dedicated warwick players, myself included, aren't even going to want to come back to him.  He's been gutted.\r\n\r\nRiot, with this latest banishment of warwick to the abyss of LOL champs that you don't like, where you leave them untouched after smiting them  for YEARS, can we at least get a promise that his rework is going to be moved up in the timeline so that at some point we can play the wolf again?","replies":[{"poster":"Gorgannan","date":"2014-12-03T05:31:01.191+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"To be fair, he's like the jungle Garen.\n\nToo easy to be allowed to be strong, and at least safe for his low power.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2014-12-03T04:15:56.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My guess is that they're putting him on the shelf for his rework later (I'm hoping for an early 2015 release on the rework).","replies":[{"poster":"Firefang Warwick","date":"2014-12-03T04:41:12.973+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"[I wouldn't get your hopes up for that](https://twitter.com/RiotMorello/status/538799009985335296)\n\nThere has been talk of his rework as far back as the end of season 2 and we mostly get the above response when it is asked about. \n\nI'm still extremely upset the kit that was spoiled earlier this year was scrapped.\n\nI'm confused how he is still so low on the list when all it took was a new item and slight changes to the jungle to make him ridiculously broken. He needs a rework not a bunch of nerfs.","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2014-12-03T05:07:33.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I kind of meant \"early 2015\" as \"first half of 2015\"; I figured there was some progress being made since they actually bothered to scrap Zenon's rework (no need to get rid of it if they weren't looking at him anytime soon). Maybe I'm too hopeful but I was thinking he might be up next after Poppy and Tristana, since there seems to be more discussion about him than like, Yorick or something. Like, turnover for Soraka rework was pretty quick, fairly soon after she became a problem (not sure how long before then she was in the works, though).\n\nChampUp has been doing a heck of a lot of work recently though, and it's likely too that Riot is hesitant about making definite statements since they do run into delays sometimes and rather not disappoint people.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"poopoo peepee","date":"2014-12-03T04:07:28.503+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I doubt these numbers will be left the same.

The issue is that it synergizes TOO WELL with ANY attack speed or multi-hit champion since the true damage is per basic attack and the bonus magic damage is on-hit.\n\nI could think of a few different options that wouldn't absolutely maim Warwick's potential:\n\n1. Halve Infinite Duress' on-hit effectiveness. \n\nThis keeps his damage that people love Warwick for but also reduces the effectiveness of the Skirmisher's Blade that makes him so overpowered.\n\n2. Adjust the On-Hit magic damage scaling.\n\nMake big monster camps only increase the damage by .5 or .75.\n\nTL;DR is that Warwick was perfectly fine beforehand. Especially after Infinite Duress' recent cooldown nerf. They didn't need to butcher his abilities when they could have butchered the items that made him too powerful.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Done25","date":"2014-12-03T04:10:41.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The smite and devour changes are.enough to tone him down. They didn't really need to nerf his.buff and ultimate while they were at it.

Meanwhile garbage like lucien ramped for year, lee sin for 3 years, i really dont have time for the length of this list.\n\nBut ya this is why riot continues to never EVER see a penny from me. They are simply incompetent.\n\nThey do this everytime a weak champion gets some play due to broken items they create, they gut the champ, then they  gut the items  or what not and then leave the champ sucking dick. Look at all the singed nerfs....yet he is total garbage and they will never buff him to compete with thier new FOTM BS no skill champs. Wait what ? sivir was getting play cause her ult was good for team fights? Okay lets nerf her ult AND EVERYTHING ELSE IN HER KIT. Hey sivir enjoy having a spell shield every 22 seconds while a champ like lucien rapes you will all his skill anyways because giving up an offensive ability for a stupid shield is sooo worth a 22 second CD, oh we will also nerf your Q, wait now sivir is garbage and will remain garbage forever.\n\nsame old trash tier riot will be great the day league goes down and these losers have to find another job.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WooBeeWoo","date":"2014-12-03T04:49:56.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't know why they are nerfing both ww AND the item that broke him lol.... Like as we move forward they will probbaly continue adjusting the jungle and before long his nerfs will be unnecessary but you know.... Riot has no clue how to balance so they are doing it all in one shot and hoping its not too much instead of modifiying the jung first or just nerfing ww idk..... seems like a lot all at once","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rustling Bush","date":"2014-12-03T04:02:55.143+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"life goes on, but i wouldnt say he was obscured to begin with.","replies":[]}]}
