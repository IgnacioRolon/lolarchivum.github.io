I can't find any help on finding out how to post on this board. It's says I need to have levels? For a forum? How do I gain levels??

Kinda ironic... it's against the rules to be a troll.. and yet in order to use this forum you have to be a troll.

I couldn't find anywhere that explained that so I wasn't sure. I know a lot of forums have their own level system, you get \"exp\" from posting and commenting. Which I think just leads to more trolling. Good to know that this isn't the case.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
