The only logs that I had were back in June and July, but I'm also sure that that was when this problem was occurring for me (I took a long hiatus because of this issue). \n\nMy logs came back as 90 or above (90,92,94), so I don't think it's a network issue. \n\nI have Comcast XFinity as my ISP and Archer T4U for my wireless adapter; however I don't think these are the issue since this problem only occurred after Riot had implemented the new Launcher UI Update back in the middle of 2017.\n\n\nEDIT: I saw a Rioter reply to someone and tell them to turn on V-Sync and turn off Movement Prediction. I tried it and it didn't work out for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-21T19:12:51.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, sorry to hear the issue has been persisting for you.
