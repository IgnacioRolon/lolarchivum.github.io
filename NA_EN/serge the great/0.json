This is turning out to be such a frustrating experience for me and I don't know what to do.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nFrom 13:21 today:\r\n\r\nHey there,\r\n\r\nI just purchased 4 chests and opened them, and was pleasantly surprised when I found an Ornn Champion Shard. There are only 7 Champions I don't have in League and I was ecstatic. I clicked the Ornn shard, then clicked Home to check something else. I then went back to my Loot--and Ornn was gone. I am so frustrated right now and I have no idea what happened. Can I please get the Ornn Champion Shard back? He's one of the only Champions I actually want that I don't have besides Kayn and I am so disappointed right now. I NEVER clicked anything to deconstruct him for Blue Essence.\r\n\r\nFrom 15:25 today:\r\n\r\nOkay, now I am even more confused. I just looked in my Loot and found a Kayn shard there. That's all well and good, but where is Ornn?\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nSo that's my current situation.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-23T21:12:30.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm strange. I'm looking over your loot history right now, and those 4 hextech chests gave you a Kayn Shard, a Shaco Shard, an Arcade Ezreal Skin Shard, and the Mechs vs Minions Ward.\n\nIf you did in fact see an Ornn shard, that must have been weird visual bug.","replies":[{"poster":"Serge THE GREAT","date":"2017-08-23T21:26:50.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am 100% sure it was Ornn.

We're looking at our tools on the backend and it's showing all of the content you received from those orbs. Like I said before, you **may** have actually seen Ornn, but that would have been a bug since the system itself doesn't show Ornn coming from those orbs. \n\nWith that being said, we're more than happy to help if our system is wrong. But in order to prove to those agents that what they're seeing is wrong I'll need to have some kind of screenshot to show them proof =\\ .","replies":[{"poster":"Serge THE GREAT","date":"2017-08-23T22:24:06.059+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for being cool about this.
