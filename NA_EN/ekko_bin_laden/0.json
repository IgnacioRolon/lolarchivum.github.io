I went through the processes to try to join both testing environments, however, the Alpha has said pending for weeks now and I don't have any info on my PBE application. It's honestly alright if I am not allowed to join, I just want to know whether I can or can't enter either of the testing grounds. \r\n\r\nThanks for your time!\r\n\r\n-TheGodHermes","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-11T21:55:06.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait times to join the PBE, if you're eligible, can be an unknown amount of time. It could be weeks, months, or even longer. The criteria we use to choose PBE testers changes all the time, but we typically look for really active players who are a positive influence on the community. \n\nOur [PBE FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751904-Public-Beta-Environment-FAQ#top) has complete details on PBE and how it all works. You can check your PBE application status on [this page](https://pbesignup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/pbe).\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Ekko Bin Laden","date":"2016-09-12T04:37:31.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for replying to me again (you responded to another problem I I had recently)! I tend to be a fairly active player and, even though I do flame from time, try my best not to be negative. Is there a way I can check how I am seen (positive or negative) to the community?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-12T16:32:00.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's no direct way to check how positive or negative you've been, other than knowing if you've had a history of chat restrictions or behavioral suspensions. I encourage you to stay positive in your games, but I understand it's natural to not feel awesome when things don't go your way. When that happens to me in a match, I just dance to silly music IRL and continue to play. You win some and you lose some, but always keep your head up. ^.^\n\nBest of luck with your applications to PBE and Alpha client.

All there is to do is wait! Thank you for your help in this matter, but I have to ask. When you say you dance to silly music, what music exactly do you dance to?
