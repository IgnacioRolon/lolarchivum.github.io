Her W specifically says that it can be used on a target &quot;Enemy Minion&quot;, but it also works on Neutral Monsters. It only bothers me because a few champions that I don&#039;t remember off hand, maybe Nunu, says both enemy minions, and Neutral Monsters. I wanted to see if that could be fixed anytime soon if possible.\r\n\r\nSecond of all, I would really love to see a Dunkmaster Syndra skin as a sequel to the Dunkmaster Darius skin. I mean that would be a pretty awesome skin :DDD{{champion:134}} \r\n\r\nThanks for reading Riot, and I hope you can get to it soon if at all :DD~!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-06-04T18:03:25.270+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey UnknownDestrayon! \n\nThanks for bringing this to our attention. I'd be happy to pass this along to the champion team. In the future, to report bugs such as this, please use the [Report a Bug](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report) board! It helps keep things a bit more organized. ^-^ \n\nI think a Dunkmaster Syndra skin could be pretty awesome, although, the Dodgeball Syndra concept will always have a special place in my heart. RITO PLS. :P \n\nhttps://38.media.tumblr.com/ff846e5397395304858a0c62903d5b30/tumblr_n6h3w1GMMb1ra6ox3o1_400.gif","replies":[{"poster":"Mansana","date":"2015-06-04T18:49:12.075+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, we need Rave Syndra for those bass drops.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jiglypuffy","date":"2015-06-10T07:04:36.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dodgeball Syndra would look awesome.
