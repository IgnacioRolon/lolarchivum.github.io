I&#039;m not sure what element it is or what its called, so if anyone can help that would be wonderful.  My problem is with EL&#039;s E (Lucent Singularity) in a couple of her forms.  What I know is that with the Snowdown SR map (Thank you for bringing that back by the way) when she has one of white or soft colored elements on I can no longer see the E on the ground. I like to think I can move/flash out of them in time if I have to, more so if I am low oh HP. But if you can&#039;t see it until the slowed trails appear there is no real counter play. \r\n\r\nNow not to go straight up salty and qq everything, I want to point out that I might not be unique in this regard however I am color blind to certain colors, is there anyway we can adjust the resolution to make it more visible or even have Riot adjust it so that it shows up better? I&#039;m not sure what else to do besides put Lux on a perma ban so I don&#039;t have to deal with not being able to see the skins abilities.\r\n\r\nAny advice or help is appreciated.\r\n\r\nSincerly Ozias of Scagnar","replies":[{"poster":"LBmyBB","date":"2016-12-30T05:14:14.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wind is kinda hard to see.  I see your point with ice but the range indicator and changes in the area make it fairly easy to notice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-12-30T00:46:41.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please stop using a shitty TN monitor. IPS mastard rice.\nNo, really. It probably is a graphics issue, but it is still a valid concern for people with colorblindness or just really shitty monitors. Since it is only a seasonal map, i doubt riot would fix it - but a red ring around it, similar to some other AoEs, would be a good change.","replies":[]}]}
