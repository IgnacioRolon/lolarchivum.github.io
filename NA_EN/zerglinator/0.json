LET'S COVER ALL THE GIRLS to cater, we just want to make the most awesome thing, and however it fits the character, is how it'll pan out in terms of archetype, whatever the gender or species is.

This trend has also continued with newer champions.  I'm sure RIOT has commented on it somewhere, but I'd love to hear their thoughts here and now.\n\nI want the gaming world to be a place that I can unapologetically send my future daughter to explore.  I'm guessing it will take many years to change the culture and attitude towards women by gamer communities -- it may never happen -- but I feel like companies like RIOT are in a pretty powerful position to be able to set the tone.","replies":[{"poster":"mrfiddles","date":"2013-09-18T13:46:08.952+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're definitely not there yet, I completely agree.

How would you feel about something akin to the halo icons where people can mix and match the icons they have available to make something unique. \n\nI know i spent more time than i care to admit just trying to make something that meshed really well out of a bunch of random icons.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Smallgeese","date":"2013-09-17T20:42:51.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why did they even do this, Reddit's League of Legends subreddit is already the biggest gaming subreddit, This is literally just a downs version of it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RiotBrokenSword","date":"2013-09-17T20:19:50.883+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, yes.
