The thing is when we disconnect no matter what the issue may be we're leaving our team in a terrible predicament, especially if we're in a ranked game. I know I get angry when a team member goes AFK or DC's and I bet you can relate too. The thing is Leaverbuster stacks up after so many disconnections or AFK's. You may want to try Riot's connection KB, which I have used and work's wonders, to try and bring the amount of DC's to a minimal amount or none at all. \n\nConnection KB: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues\n\nLeaverbuster faq: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ\n\nI just wanna help you out. I'll be on for awhile so if you have any questions i'll try and help you the best way I can. \n\n\n{{champion:25}} {{summoner:4}} {{item:3157}}","replies":[]}]}
