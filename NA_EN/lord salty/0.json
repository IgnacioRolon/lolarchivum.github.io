This resolution would be fine but as my monitor is built to handle 2560x1440 it rendered the game unplayable, (I was missing easy to hit skill shots, my characters model was stretched to oblivion, the game was zoomed in a good 150% even after zooming out as much as I could, etc. etc.) I tried forcing it to play at 2560x1440 by changing the setting in game but it continuously forced itself to 1920x1080, I tried switching to Full Screen, Windowed Borderless and even tried to play it Windowed for a few games (still unplayable). I've initiated a full repair of the client, and restarted my computer (multiple times) but unfortunately to no avail, the only thing I haven't tried is re-installing the full game (which I'd like to avoid doing since my download speed is awful). If anyone has had any similar issues/knows how to help me with mine, please let me know :)","replies":[{"poster":"HaZzORDoUs","date":"2017-06-06T21:22:10.671+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Got an similar issue with a 1440p Monitor. Tried reinstalling the game and even Windows, because i thought it might be a DirectX Bug but still the same issue. The game renders at  some 4:3 resolution (i think 1024x768) despite being set to 2560x1440.  But HUD elements are shown at the right resolution. (Screenshot: http://imgur.com/a/4W1FV ). I figured that if I switch to a HDMI cable instead of the DisplayPort Cable (that works everywhere else perfectly), while being Ingame and having those issues, i get a bugsplat (already reported it). After reconnecting the game works just fine. I tried another DisplayPort Cable but the issue persits.","replies":[{"poster":"HaZzORDoUs","date":"2017-06-07T15:38:11.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Switched on GPU Scaling in AMD Settings and set the resolution of the monitor to 1080p. now it works again.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Espillion","date":"2017-06-07T07:06:00.642+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have exactly the same problem, ive tried changing resoultions through the game and the .cfg file, and  tried all the scaling options in nvidia control panel to no avail. i have also repaired and tried reinstalling league both didnt change the problem","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-07T22:48:19.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Though your monitor can handle higher resolutions, League doesn't support it yet.  Using a 4K or exceeding 1920x1080 can result in issues and interruptions.  You'll want to stick to a lower res for now!  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]}]}
