But, if I'm fast enough to accept, the entire ban phase is complete lag. By the time the game has recognized that I have declared a champion, my ban pick has already passed/ran out of time. And this happens often so the queue dodge timers are freaking tilting me so hard! What am I doing wrong? If it helps, comment any information you may need to help me. Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nP.S. I already sent a bug report hours ago. Maybe the forums will give me more direct help.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-09T02:37:54.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you running a lower-spec computer?
