Pick Hecarim or WW. Maybe even Sion.\r\nNeed a splitpusher/duelist? Pick Jax or Irelia\r\nNeed CC? Pick Maokai or Malphite or Sion.\r\nNeed a damage soak? Mundo, Sion, or basically any of the champions I listed before\r\n\r\nAll of the aforementioned champions are better than Aatrox at all stages of the game too. They're tankier, do more damage, and are safer in lane because they can abuse flask/tp.\r\n\r\nPlease buff Aatrox","replies":[]}
