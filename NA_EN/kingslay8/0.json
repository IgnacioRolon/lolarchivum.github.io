When he would get check, I would get nothing. After that, I would have to wait 5 minutes before queuing up again. This is regular for me. It kept happening, so much to the point where the time before being allowed to queue up would be 30 minutes. When that happened we just abandoned ranked, waited the 30 mins, and then went to draft instead. Today, I found out that all those times that I \"didn't accept a check\", I lost LP.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-17T23:53:52.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you are having a network issue that is causing you to lose sync upon accepting the match.  When in queue, the server groups everyone together and places them in champion select but it seems that a communication issue is leaving you behind.  I suggest using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to fix up your connection, but to also test it in custom games to prevent further penalties.  Let me know if you have any issues afterward!","replies":[]}]}
