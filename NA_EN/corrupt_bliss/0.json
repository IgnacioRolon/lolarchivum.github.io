Upon trying to load both the Beta client and the Legacy client, both end up crashing/not loading. I get the error specifically when I use the Legacy Client and press the 'Play' button. \n\nThe Alpha client on the other hand simply shows the League of Legends icon, and then never loads. \n\nI've restarted the computer and reinstalled league but cannot get past this error for some reason. I've checked all permissions but am simply stumped!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-01T00:15:13.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're on the right track about permissions, because it does sound like something is preventing the client from opening.
