I also agree the other three MacFarlanes have some very amusing moments, they just aren't shows I would prioritize. In general, I don't enjoy any of the live action shows on adult swim, and have always found King of the Hill boring (though I think a good sized group of people like it). Something I would add is that adult swim may have a high variance between good and bad shows, but their ad breaks are much more enjoyable than most TV Networks.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jet Sett","date":"2017-07-26T20:23:10.082+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly the Tim and Eric series and similar shows were terrible to me.
