The game itself has more dmg and some drastically changes should be made to make it less snowbally and get the games from 20 min baron wins:\n\n    1.All structures should get extra 50% hp: Turrets , Inhibs, Nexus and also if an allied champion is near his structure that structure gets 15% dmg reduction.\n    2.Dragons , Rift herald : increase hp by 25%.\n    3.Baron: increase damage by 100%.\n    4.Reduce AP dmg taken by structures. This changes will make it harder to snowball the game thus giving time to Crit ADCs to scale and open even more team comps possibilities.\n\nOne more change I would like to highlight would be removal of Chrysalis from Resolve tree and increasing all champs hp by 60 from lvl1 to compensate for extremlly high lvl 1 dmg and preventing of perma Resolve second tree meta.\n\nPlease share this one and let&#039;s try all together to come up with ideas to make this game better and stop mindlessly complaining but come with solutions to the problems we have/see.","replies":[{"poster":"Dotrix","date":"2018-06-18T04:52:51.360+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that making the game less snowbally by increasing tower survivability is a good way to go without directly changing any champions. The super fast pace of the game is the crux of the issue here, the game is over before most ADC's even have a chance to come online. Extending the game a little will address that issue and give them a fighting chance. Early game picks like Lucian will still have a big enough window to snowball and close out the game reliably but they'll actually have to use their lead effectively or have a true and realistic risk of being outscaled. League should be more complex than win lane win game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Holymanster","date":"2018-06-18T17:21:59.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad you understand my point but I think too many people are upset they can't easy carry a game and the game no more depends only on them and thats why so much uproar though it was like this during season 3 and ADCs somehow still carried games .","replies":[]}]}
