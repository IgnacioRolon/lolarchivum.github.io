I&#039;ve loved some of the designs of recent 750&#039;s (especially the SSW skins). However, I must admit that with these new Prehistoric ones I am a bit torn... \r\n\r\nOn one hand, objectively I love the idea behind these themed skins. Timing is perfect with Jurassic World coming. Teaser as cute. I really like Anivia and Cho&#039;gath&#039;s skins (Renektons doesn&#039;t exactly have that great of readability in my opinion... is he some sort of ancient corodilian? Sea creature? I can tell what Anivia and Cho are based on easy.) \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, my bias towards having desired a truly prehistoric lizard beast champ leaves me saddened that these skins came down the pipeline before a champ concept. While yes Renekton is a crocodile man, and Gnar is a prehistoric Yordle, neither feel like a dinosaurian champ proper. Renekton has a much more egyptian-esque vibe then prehistoric, as per his Shurima lore, and Gnar is more like if a Caveman could go Hulk. No champion has really scratched that huge itch I&#039;ve had for this specific type of champ. I mean, when I saw Anivia&#039;s new model I was sure that could have potentially made an excellent Pterodactyl-esque champ. \r\n\r\nSo I suppose my questions are, do any of the teams between skins and champ concept possibly juggle what might make for a better skin then champ? Has any champ concept been narrowed down to be a skin or even the reverse? Is there public interest aside from myself for a dinosaur champion? Is there not enough interest internally to make one? \r\n\r\nI know guys at Riot saw an excellent opportunity for some fun low cost skins, but I&#039;d like some insight into this.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-05-29T00:55:14.380+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\n**Do any of the teams between skins and champ concept possibly juggle what might make for a better skin then champ?**\n\nWhile we do converse with the champion team, there generally isn't discussion around what could make a better skin, as opposed to a champion. \n\n**Has any champ concept been narrowed down to be a skin or even the reverse?** \n\nTo my knowledge, nope! \n\n**Is there public interest aside from myself for a dinosaur champion?**\n\nI think an actual dinosaur champion has a lot of potential to be cool, especially if we give it some kind of 'Runeterra' style. \n\n **Is there not enough interest internally to make one?**\n\nI'm not on the champion team myself (I'm on skins), so I can't comment on their processes, or how they determine who the next champion is, the role they play, or what they look like. D: However, same rule as skins kind of apply - just because it doesn't exist doesn't mean it couldn't later down the road!","replies":[{"poster":"KyriaTheMystic","date":"2015-06-08T13:29:34.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for the response Katey. Apologies for the late reply, been busy with work and fam. I bet you know that feeling, heh. :P \n\nI see you around a lot on the forums. I really do appreciate you responding even on some questions that aren't in your field. :3 \n\nAnd a Runeterra style dino would be amazing! <3 Considering how I've seen the champ team handle a slightly more primordial creature (Gnar) and the skin team with these Prehistoric skins, I bet it would be amazing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OhtheShinx","date":"2015-05-29T01:55:41.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That moment when you realize its named runeterra becuase terra means earth..\n\nRune-Earth","replies":[]}]}]}
