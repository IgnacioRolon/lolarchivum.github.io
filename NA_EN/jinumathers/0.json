Suddenly, the speed drops step by step. Now showing the ETA 1000+ mins! \r\nIf I restart the client, it starts downloading from the beginning. What to do? \r\nWill it take years to download this game or it is a never-ending process?\r\nPlease fix this or give a proper solution! I have paid money to buy RP before! That's why I have to stick with that game! Else I should quit this game.","replies":[{"poster":"JinuMathers","date":"2017-11-04T13:44:14.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you!

If it seems to be moving way slower than it should, do me a favor and try updating your Port Forwarding and DNS settings to get a clearer signal to our servers. If you're not sure how to do that, check out those steps in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and let me know how they work out for you.","replies":[]}]}
