He did amazing work, nailing so many takes so fast.\nWe split the records to three days to try and save his voice-- but each day he was willing to push it further than was rational. A total pro, he was quick to adjust to notes, totally in control of his instrument, and easy to work with.

Either that or Etna from Disgaea.","replies":[]}]}]}
