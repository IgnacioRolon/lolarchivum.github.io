Hope I qualify for the 'any Rioter' requirement for the thread!\n\nThe answer to \"Are things progressing?\" is a solid **YES**.\n\nNow, to give what little else I know (and it is very little - I'm sorry).   \n**The tl;dr is - Stuff is being worked on, think in terms of months, stay suspicious!**\n\n**The tech issues** - those are the ones with probably the clearest timeline that I've found.  No, I can't tell you what's involved or when, but it's not just a lore issue - it affects a few other areas too.  Which (cynically?) is probably why it has a fire under it to hurry up.  Think in terms of less than a year, more than a month - but as with all things, that is a development best guess and could turn into 'never'.  This one is at least on the good side of likely.\n\n**Lores **- This one is harder to talk about, even than the vague stuff above.  They write them (and I know a writer who seems a bit sad that their character story hasn't got to you guys yet) but there have been shifts in focuses for the team.  Might be due to the fallout from the retcon, might be due to changes in leadership.  Might be for other reasons that I don't even have awareness of!  I heard some optimistic news recently that would answer this question soundly, but again - it's several months out AT THE EARLIEST.  That particular news may turn into 'never' but realize that I don't mean lores in general.  Like - I could say that \"burger = never\" but you'd still get food at some point, just not that particular burger.  Man, I hope I don't get fired for this burger analogy.\n\n**Discussions** - Oh hell yes.  So much discussion.  I sometimes get to sit in on them, which is a great window into the process for me (and helps me develop my skills in other disciplines - always be learning!)  Discussions are being had at all levels of the narrative side.  The one regular discussion I regularly go to has discussions and decisions on the regions and cities and cultures, on the underlying metaphysics and belief systems, on the relationships between the champions, and more.  That's only the one I'm in, which is a long, low burning one.  There are more I don't see.\n\n**Fan opinions** - Yes.  Opinions looked at, yes.  I won't say anything about the fan-fiction side of things (because that's a hornets nest and no mistake) but opinions on champions etc. are definitely looked at.  Several times there have been calls to discuss champions (which went badly and/or weren't attended by red-names enough) because it's one way to find out what *elements *of a champion you guys really latch on to.  \n\n I know that the changes to Xerath and Trundle etc. pissed some people right off - and I could, in my innately diplomatic way, try to argue that the underlying core of both of them didn't change depending on your perspective (and you could all shout me down and call me a traitor - as is your right - especially as I'm not a Xerath or Trundle main) but if you have a champ that you want to make clear what the core motivation or struggle is - then writing about it here and having other players confirm and discuss it with you will have a non-zero chance of being read.\n\nFor example - I'm a Sona main - there was a discussion started by a player here a while ago about Sona, her kit, her old lore, and what we, the players, thought was her core.  To me personally  - I think that she probably has an unhealthy protector/oppressor relationship with her etwahl instrument - and if I were called to rewrite her lore, then I'd probably ensure that element was the core of it.  Now, if someone else here felt that Sona's core motivation was her need to be the center of a crowd (maybe inspired by her aura-creating kit) then they'd ensure THAT was the linchpin of her story.  \n\nNow - don't worry - I'm not writing any lores here!  (I'm actually trying to write some spare-time fan-fiction of my own, but reddit won't give me any writing feedback - bah.)  But I'm saying that some champs have several aspects to them.  Maybe it's a 'desire for power' - and some interpret that as a desire for magical power, and someone else interprets it as a desire for political power via magic.  \n\nSo yes, I'm pretty sure they read your opinions - because they want to know what resonates most strongly with us all.  Otherwise sometimes they hear 'blue' and go 'cyan', when someone else meant 'periwinkle'.  (Bear in mind, that if every single shade of blue is shouted as the 'most critical' shade, then something's gotta give).\n\nCommence the keelhauling!","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-03-17T16:59:01.811+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, I'm going to be polite because it's a Rioter I actually like.\n\nSeriously?

I was taken aside, and had it all explained to me - those sorts of timelines included.\n\nI wasn't happy either, but the plans that they have sound reasonable behind the scenes.  I can see why they'd keep quiet about it - because if any part of the plan fails or changes, more delays are absolutely not what anyone wants to hear about.  \"Wait and see\" is the suckiest thing to say, worse to hear, and I imagine some feel that they should just keep their mouths shut until they have something to show.\n\nThanks, by the way, for not going off on one on me, Hellioning.

There's always at least a couple of champions in production at any one time; some might just be concepts that Rito is trying out, and then there's some that are confirmed 'we want to do this' that are having their art done and getting coded, and then there's some that are in preliminary testing and waiting for them to get the OK for release.

At Riot, we mostly form teams around the things we release to you, the players - not around our specific fields. New champions is one of those teams, and it includes some writers. That is, they're narrative writers ON Champion team, and both parts together are what is really important. (this is true for most other fields as well, by the way)\n\nWhen we're working on new champions, narrative is one of the key pieces involved from Day 1. It isn't a matter of just shipping champs off to \"the narrative team\" at the end to write a backstory. Narrative is involved from the very beginning, and they work with the rest of champion team AS WELL as the rest of the narrative discipline to make sure our champs are the best they can be and fit into the world we're building.\n\nAnd like Bioluminescence mentioned, the narrative writers on champion team are involved in multiple champions at the same time, at different stages. They help explore and set tone, keep art and gameplay cohesive, work on VO, assist with launch materials, and so much more. They're integral to helping members of the champion team understand who these characters are, which we believe makes everything about them better.\n\nI know this doesn't answer the larger lore questions you have (and unfortunately, I don't know those answers), but I hope it at least helps give some more context. And lastly, to one of your latter points, this isn't about \"selling you something\". The story you get with new releases is a culmination of a lot of work from the very beginning to make a character you'll (hopefully) love.","replies":[{"poster":"GenoXx","date":"2015-03-18T15:30:17.125+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Dude, Why is it always **on champ release???**  It wasn't like this before(JoJ) \nSo ur telling me that none of the said stories from last year about the shurima champs are going to get release simply because who ever is put on the next champ's team isn't working on those champs???\n\nSo since Ezreal already got released, we won't be seeing anymore of him or anyone else, **or ** ANY progression into the story of league because you guys are only doing champ release stories now.\n\nJust Wow.

We also know you're tired of hearing this this from us, but we really need more time and we ask you to trust us even if we can't give you a reason to.\"\n\nIn other words, the **exact same shit** we've heard for the past three years from Riot and Narrative.  If you wonder why we jump on every Red that posts in here, Narrative or not, it's because every single one of you keeps giving us the same song and dance and nothing changes.\n\nWe've been given nothing but the same lies and bullshit from Runaan, Opeli, and Kitae after the Freljord disaster that we've been getting from TommyGnox, Jaredan and Loping Cinder.  It's old, it's frustrating and we deserve better treatment and results after waiting this long.\n\nEven when Rioters tell us \"we want to make Lore a priority,\" they NEVER actually do that, which just creates another lie that they've constantly told us.\n\nSo, when someone like Bio comes in and says \"you should feel angry and you deserve to be angry because we've failed you for way too long.\" we gravitate to it.

I know that the anger and attacks are born of passion. The fact that you are taking the time to post, and putting in this amount of effort (no matter how it manifests) means that you care. You, and everybody else who posts on this cares deeply - so, so deeply - about this world we've created. That's **insanely humbling**, and it's something I continue to remind myself whenever I feel attacked. It's why I keep coming back.\n\n> We've been given nothing but the same lies and bullshit from Runaan, Opeli, and Kitae after the Freljord disaster that we've been getting from TommyGnox, Jaredan and Loping Cinder.

We've promised things, and then not delivered. It is not unreasonable for you to sit there and say \"hey, what the hell Riot?\"\n\nThe thing is, there is a whole reality of development that you don't see. There is SO much work going on behind the scenes. Not just in narrative, but across the board. We experiment on things, test them out, and then throw it away if it doesn't work. If it does work, we keep testing, iterating, refining.\n\nWe also rely on other teams to help get things out to players - so we need to share that context. Even when things go smoothly, it takes time to get everybody on board. It's even harder to share that outward, because we run the very real risk of promising something, and then not delivering. Which then causes you to sit there and say (again) \"hey, what the hell Riot?\"\n\nIt's a really hard thing. We could just not talk about anything until it's set and ready for release; but that feels unsatisfying. And odds are, we'd just be accused of not caring. \n\nBut If we speak on things too early, we'll likely end up shifting directions (if only subtly) before release. I know that every single person you called out was speaking the truth at the time they posted. But the truth can, and will, shift over time - and then we're branded as liars. \n\n> Unfortunately, it's a monster that the entire company created after four years of the same lies and broken promises and it doesn't look like it's getting better.\n\nI honestly don't know how to solve this, other than finally delivering on what we've promised. But that's just repeating something you already know, and I totally get that it's unsatisfying. Closing with that only adds more frustration.\n\nSo instead, I'll close with some of my personal feelings. This isn't me speaking as a Rioter, but as a fellow passionate player. These also aren't directed at you, TerraRising, but just my thoughts in general:\n\n\n* Personally, I think the claim that there's been no lore development is a little unfair. [This thread from a while back](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/AGEM160T-what-we-learned-in-2014-a-k-a-tldr-lore) recapped everything that happened last year (including the retcon), and tried to extrapolate what it meant, and what we learned. I don't know how accurate the conclusions are, and I'm sure a lot of what's there is up for debate. But I also think it pretty solidly illustrates that there was a LOT of stuff released last year.\n\n\n* I think there's room to channel the frustrations more productively. Jumping at people with these frustrations, while understandable, is a total turnoff. It feels as though some people are so determined to be mad that they'll twist anything that is said to justify being mad. I've literally been working on this post for 2 hours trying to make sure I don't say anything that's just going to get taken out of context and make matters worse. I truly feel that my intentions - and those of my fellow Rioters - are coming from the right place. So if something in here comes off sounding bad, it's most likely me doing a bad job of expressing myself.\n\n\n* I would love to find more threads talking about broad topics. It's easier for me to engage when we aren't getting bogged down into very specific executions. What themes do you enjoy seeing? Are there certain parts of the world you want to see developed? Heck, do you even care about world-building? Or are champ stories the only thing that matters? Did you prefer any particular story style? Let's talk about those things.\n\n\n* And lastly, as much as we all love League - we're also all people. Let's engage on those levels too! What stories had the biggest impact on you? What are your goals in life? What are your favorite games of all time, and why?

I understand that hate and rage just makes Rioters not want to deal with the forums, or even just the playerbase, but it's not like narrative's communication can get much worse.

It's why I try to keep my frustrations in check. But to us, 'Riot working hard, trying to get lore out to us as fast as they can' and 'Rioters laughing about how the stupid forum people ACTUALLY THINK they care about lore' look identical. \n\n> * I would love to find more threads talking about broad topics.

And I'm worried. On most of the big character changes, I've seen Rioters admitting, a couple of months later, that they underestimated how much some people liked Trundle's underdog nature/Karma's fans, or Xelnath having to explain to Jaredan 'this is why Xerath fans are upset'. I want to make sure Riot knows why we like champions, because I'm not particularly happy at their track record.\n> * And lastly, as much as we all love League - we're also all people.

I kinda get irrationally angry when I see most of the posts in the redtracker are things like 'WHAT'S YOURE FAVORITE COLOR!?'

Well, as is so often the case in these unfortunate situations, I think both sides are feeling defensive. From the community perspective, these \"shock reveals\" of rewrites and retcons have us pretty anxious. I don't know if I'm going to log in tomorrow and find out that Ionia is now a floating island that nobody in Valoran has ever heard of, or that Piltover and Demacia are at war, or that Zaun is a suburb of Piltover, or that Morgana is now from Shurima.\n\nWhen we're talking about brand new characters or settings, or even about new material that's \"backwards compatible\" with the established lore, I think shock reveals are much more appropriate. I still think that some community discussion is likely to be appreciated and enriching, but sure, those are \"blank slate\" scenarios where I can see a reasonable person deciding that a \"SURPRISE!!!!!!!\" reveal is the right way to go. But when you're rewriting huge pieces of a living story-verse, I think that's a really dangerous modus operandi to adopt.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Starlighte","date":"2015-03-18T16:16:02.347+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot ShadowStorm,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=4TK7oKqj,comment-id=00040001000000000001,timestamp=2015-03-18T07:45:12.707+0000)\n>And lastly, to one of your latter points, this isn't about \"selling you something\".

But maybe that's just how they run things?\n> \n> Like, do they do something like champion releases? There's always at least a couple of champions in production at any one time; some might just be concepts that Rito is trying out, and then there's some that are confirmed 'we want to do this' that are having their art done and getting coded, and then there's some that are in preliminary testing and waiting for them to get the OK for release. Does narrative not do anything similar? It's not like this hasn't been a new thing; I get that trying to come up with a cohesive narrative for your entire, multi-million dollar IP is a daunting task, but they've had years since the JoJ was removed and almost a full year since the retcon announcement, and we still only have lore when Riot wants to sell us something.\n> \n> Well, at least you talked to us about it.

Their role in that is one of keeping the creative vision aligned between multiple departments - ensuring that the concept, the art, the kit, the vo and sound, the effects, etc. etc. all tie together and reinforce each other and the core concept.  It sounds simple, and in a smaller dev team there wouldn't even need to be a person to do that!  But here, from what I can tell, that's a big job with a lot of moving parts - especially with the amount of iteration that champs go through internally.  There's also writing new VO, working with outsource on champ videos, working on teaser sites, and probably more.\n\nAnd yes - it's so much easier to get writing time when a new champion has a deadline coming up and they NEED to get their video or short snippet of writing, or 5 sentence background, done and localized by a set release date.  It's easy to see that as \"Only when Riot tries to sell something\" but it's likely that everything else gets pushed out of the way when a new champ is about to drop, because that's the most broadly exciting thing to players and usually has a *real* deadline to hit.\n\nIn the background, groundwork goes on in the gaps - getting clear handles on other parts of the Runeterra world, making sure they work together, and ensuring that it gets turned into useful forms that every Rioter can understand and won't accidentally contradict.\n\nI'm trying to write about how longer lore was written for a while (like RekSai and Sion) but that releasing things like that (like Azir, etc.) on forums *probably* wasn't very successful.  The forums, as a way of releasing stuff, is a pretty crappy method.  The forums are a small, but very interesting, corner of the way that players interact with League - most players never go there, and then if you divide it up by language and region, that proportion seems even smaller.

It is my very personal opinion that I am really happy that didn't happen.  Controversy!!!\n\nI've certainly noticed that in **[Factions](http://LeagueFactions.net)**. Some people really, REALLY hate yordles. (It honestly sort of surprised me, because, I mean, they're yordles. One of my friends has a theory that some people just get really angry at the idea of being beaten by cute fuzzballs.) Granted, that was in part because at one point Bandle City double-crossed Zaun (\"betrayordles\") after Zaun had quite magnanimously **[deployed troops to protect them from an undead horde.](http://leaguefactions.net/herald-i-01/)** It still seems like a disproportionate amount of hate. After all, Zaun **[set off a bomb in Piltover,](http://leaguefactions.net/hextech-revolution-update-2-opening-moves/)** and while a lot of people dislike Zaun, it doesn't seem quite as fierce. It's like people are vaguely okay with other \"awesome dudes\" wrecking them, but flip out if their victorious adversary is a cuddly little yordle. I suppose there's potentially something \"emasculating\" about it; it would be interesting to see if yordle opinions split along gender lines.\n\nMyself, I rather like yordles. I think their \"edginess\" should come from how alien and inhuman they are, which is part of why I'm a big proponent of the Mothership idea. On the one hand, I think it's derpily hilarious that they're a race of hamster-cats who worship a spacecraft, and it definitely adds to their cuteness. On the other hand, it also gives them some depth, and helps explain why other civilizations have trouble trusting them—they're ordinarily a pleasant people, with a knack for a non-threatening brand of trade and commerce, but if the Mothership commands them to do something, they'll break every other promise to obey. In addition, the Mothership is just downright **weird,** and I think yordles are much more interesting if their cuteness is tempered by an vaguely eerie sub-theme. A certain xenophobia also seems like an appropriate counterbalancing trait for a species that's so intensely community-oriented. The whole \"Teemo is actually a sociopath\" thing might have originally been a \"lol why not\" joke, but I think it's become more than that: it's just the sort of perverse twist that I think gives yordles some depth. It's funny, but also alienating and **weird.** I think that's wonderful.\n\nI have to say that I find the idea of a darker-and-grittier yordle kind of weird. Especially with the retcon of the League, I think Valoran is getting much too dark, bordering on genuine grimdark at times: my overwhelming impression of the new Valoran is a miserable, wretched place where every faction hides out in its little hole fighting to survive, deeply suspicious of all others, and often only dimly aware of their very existence. I really, really don't like that, and I don't think it's a good fit for League. Some people object to the idea of League as \"cartoony\" or \"derpy\", but I think it's deep in its DNA, and I don't think it's a bad thing. Some people have this penchant for grimdark fiction, perhaps especially those who fear that others will mock their love of fantasy as frivolous or \"sissy\". I had such an inclination myself for a while. But really, I think League's comic-book punchiness and handwavey casualness give it much of its charm. Silly, cute yordles are becoming even more important, now that everything else seems to be going uber-dark.\n\nSpeaking of what I've noticed a strange amount of hatred for—Riven. There is a sizable contingent of Factions community members who **despise** Riven with greater vitriol than I would have expected.

(Her voicework is pretty good, too, although I find myself involuntarily giggling at what I call the \"Guidance Counselor Riven\" lines—it's weird to go from \"So much death…\" to \"Follow your own path!\") I think she's got a deeply compelling backstory, and really deepens the Noxian setting: it's challenging, but I think rewarding, to contemplate why some Noxians might not embrace \"victory at all costs\", and might not see total annihilation through techmaturgic weaponry as a true victory. This was one of the first big Factions \"interactive lore events\": **[The True Noxus](http://leaguefactions.net/mirrorwater-update-5-the-true-noxus/)**, where Noxian Summoners had to decide between Singed and Riven. (They went with Riven.) She returned to play a key role in **[Shon-Xan](http://leaguefactions.net/shon-xan/)**, at the end of which the Reformists lost out to the \"New Noxus\" movement under Swain, with a particularly crushing defeat during a failed uprising (which Riven took no part in on either side) in the course of the **[Hextech Revolution](http://leaguefactions.net/hextech-revolution-update-8-shield-of-light/)**.\n\nI won't say she's my favorite character. But I like her. If I have a major gripe against her, it's that she's so angsty and self-righteous, and still has some serious narcissism going on. (Indeed, one not-entirely-unfair critical framing of her backstory would be that she was totally fine with slaughtering civilians until she got caught in the crossfire.) More than making her unsympathetic, those traits can start to get kind of tiresome: I for one do not get particularly excited about \"another lore update of Riven moralizing\". She's not as fun as many other characters, but she can be compelling.\n\nThe other thing is that, while I like her backstory overall, the Vietnam allusions reeeeeaaalllly push that derpy line. You know, the one that Doran's story is right on top of, and a hypothetical story about Noxus enacting a \"Final Solution\" for \"the Yordle problem\" would lie just on the other side of. There was a little bit of \"holy fuck, did you REALLY just…oh, FFS, Riot, really?\"\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Bioluminescence,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=4TK7oKqj,comment-id=00040000000000000001,timestamp=2015-03-18T02:58:40.135+0000)\n> \n> On your other note - I'm fully in favor of Yordles being part of our comic, weird, and anti-grimdark element.  I can totally see that there are people who push against that, declaring that it is too silly for super-serial stories, etc.  I'm not a fan of that\n\nI think yordles really are delightful that way. It's such a refreshing break from Noxians and Demacians hitting each other with big pieces of metal, and all the decapitations and disembowelings. I do think that it's even better if the yordles themselves have just a twinge of eeriness, which is part of why I like the Mothership: if they're pure sugar, I think it's a little too much. Besides, in another sense, their \"alien\" quality makes them all the cuter. It's also nice because they're really the only major non-human civilization around, and so I think it's appropriate to play up the fact that, no, they don't really work *quite* like humans.\n\n{{champion:37}} \nAs for Sona, I think it's interesting that people are so attached to her. My favorite thing about her was the old joke about how she's the most bloodthirsty Champion in the League, though I admit I find that joke a bit less enjoyable now, as it was a playful jest about \"why would she join the League?\", and that ties into the case built in secret against the League in the darker corners of the Narrative department prior to the Great Retcon. Doesn't seem quite as funny anymore. Instead, I've moved to the slightly more aggressive joke about:\n\n***Only you can hear me, BLUE TEAM PLAYER #5.***\n\nI've made my peace with Riot splitting lore and gameplay. But to me it seems eminently reasonable that, if we're \"still Summoners in the game\", even if we've been kicked out of Runeterra generally, we ought to be allowed to be, well, Summoners in the game. What's the harm in Champions talking about Summoners? I mean, the new party line is that Summoner's Rift doesn't actually exist in Runeterra. They're not rushing to rename it \"Magical Person's Rift\". So why the haste to scrub the voicework of any reference to the players (Summoners)? I found it immersive to have the Champions banter at me from time to time, whether to encourage me to \"Stay positive!\" or complimenting my \"tactical decision\", or to leer at me about the stains on my soul (\"PERFECT!\").

And why are they not explaining their own CF?\n\nBioluminescence, it's great that you're here so don't get me wrong. But the information you just dropped on us, \"greater than a month but less than a year\" that.... That is a nuke you just dropped, and nobody is around in their radiation gear. Not the community, not Narrative, not even the rest of Riot. Just you.\n\nThis kind of policy, of letting people like you tank the flak for Narrative's mistakes, is bullshit. Anything less than Narrative showing up and actually following through on their promises of communication, and some legitimate show of \"community feedback DOES matter\" is unacceptable for a company that claims to be the most player focused company in the industry.\n\nAs it stands, Narrative is a perfect example of why the previous statement, is false.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2015-03-19T06:31:27.932+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":7,"body":"The rest of the world has been something in process and exploration for a while. The announcement was done at the time it was because players were noticing things when we left doors open in content for what we were working on. We wanted to let you know this, and wanted to be able to communicate as soon as we could, which is why the original post by Tommy Gnox (which was actually by many people across Riot) attempted to make it clear that things are WIP, but it's a direction we are committed to.\n\nIt was either communicate before we had a full raft of content set up, or wait until it was ready (and that would have meant a longer period of silence, which we wanted to avoid).\n\nBy the way, for clarity: When I say \"we\" in these things, I'm talking about Riot, not just Narrative alone. We don't work that way.\n\nIn regard to Narrative answering the questions, I'm sorry, it's taken me a day to get to the boards due to being a bit swamped at the mo for reasons I can't wait to share with you. I was hoping to respond last night, but it wasn't possible.\n\nThe reason it's taking this long to produce content, outside of that produced around Champion releases and other products, is because we are exploring a variety of ways to tell story, developing new processes and product teams to deliver it, evaluating prioritization across Riot, restructuring and evolving Narrative as a discipline (as Bioluminescence stated, and as I have elsewhere, Narrative is a group that works on a number of different product teams in Riot), all in order to deliver higher quality than we have before.\n\nWhile that is ongoing, we are still delivering new content such as Harrowing, Sion, Rek'Sai, Bard, etc.\n\nThe periodical story releases hit a roadblock in the initial tech issue problem (we're currently reviewing a solution), and other issues that arose due to prioritization, staff availability, and things being worked on by a number of teams that I can't go into out of respect for their process.\n\nNo slight on Bio at all (she, as I've stated elsewhere, is awesome), but some of her statements of what \"might\" be the reasons behind certain things are not accurate. Fallout from the retcon is not a reason as the process and goals behind it are unchanged. There has been a change in leadership on Narrative, but the overall goals for Riot have not changed in that time. \n\nOne of the reasons for a delay in the replacements for current bios, and the more extended stories from them (aside from the completed ones we haven't been able to release yet, such as Amumu) is partly that we have been reading your feedback and we're working on a format that will give more details than the current snapshot character intros, while still leaving room for us to explore the Champions in stories as they happen in a changing world. And yes, your feedback does matter.\n\nI'm not sure what Bio's estimates pertain to specifically, we'll make sure to chat about it (there are several things in motion that may or may not hit the timeline she outlined), but it is likely you will see at least some of the stories we have worked on sooner rather than later. I know that sounds the wishy-est of washy, but after expecting to be able to release a few stories within a few days before, then things having to be delayed due to further tech issues, I have to be a bit cagey.\n\nFrankly, I hate being cagey. I'm not that type of bloke, but it's a truth of what I have to do and how I am able to communicate on the boards. I do speak for Narrative, but I cannot divulge many of the things that we are working on, particularly as they are inextricably part of teams that include artists, producers, engineers, game designers, visual designers etc. etc. that are working hard to deliver content planned out across 2015 and beyond.\n\nI spend much of my posts here to say that things are being worked on, that there are issues, that we are working at problems, and I know it is tiring to many of the players who frequent the boards to hear. It isn't satisfying as you want the evidence, because you've had similar words delivered for a very long time, and you're still waiting for results.\n\nI've spent the last couple of days in discussion with a variety of Rioters about moving forward and creating pipelines to allow for sustainable, high quality stories. There is absolutely the will and desire to make this happen across many teams and disciplines, but there is a lot of work to be done.\n\nThough it is not satisfying, and I understand the weight of the pinch of salt my words will be taken with, we are working to meet the needs that have been identified here on the boards. We can't answer everything exactly in the way it's wanted (we are not planning to undo the changes we have made to the story world, for example), but we are striving to deliver story in a way that is satisfying and sustained.","replies":[{"poster":"Starlighte","date":"2015-03-19T06:48:55.149+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jaredan,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=4TK7oKqj,comment-id=000400080000,timestamp=2015-03-19T06:31:27.932+0000)\n>\n> ~snip\n\n6 months since the retcon.\n24 months since any meaningful dialogue was had with Narrative.\n\nI get that restructuring is difficult and you guys have had change in leadership several times over, but come on... You can't really expect us to believe that stuff moves this slow at Riot. Hell, a full champion from start to finish takes less time than pushing out full bios, deciding on new avenues for lore, coming up with a plan for periodical lore releases that AREN'T tied to champion releases (as your point of Harrowing, Rek'sai, Braum etc. are all tied to content being released to be sold.)\n\nJaredan I respect you for actually showing up and not just avoiding shitty tough questions like these but shit... I want to see something that earns the trust back that has been destroyed over the past two years, and this isn't really cutting it.\n\nI know you guys at Riot absolutely loathe timelines, you loathe talking about upcoming content (Hello Jax, Morgana, Kayle, Fid, how are you doing now that the IoW is no longer a thing? What is your story now? What makes you, you?) but you may be verbalizing with the community, but that isn't the same as communicating or taking feedback. The community wants input, legitimate dialogues with you and the teams about what to do going forward with characters that we care about. I'm a dedicated Morgana main. Honestly, I probably have over a thousand games on her and her lore is fantastic to me. But how am I supposed to trust you guys on reworking her lore, when in the past two years you (Narrative in general) have given me no reason to trust in your skills of maintaining a character's core traits?\n\nUnless we're talking about it, and feel like we have a part to play in shaping the story going forward, communication is never going to improve. You need to impact the feedback loop, and this is the right way to go about it. Fuck the wishy-washy timelines. People get that, shit comes up and you don't want to get burned. But please, for the love of whatever you hold dear (as many of us hold some of these champions dear) do NOT continue with the modum operandi of \"Surprise>Player's Connections To Champions\" because that is where you will lose trust across the board with any change you make going forward with this retcon.\n\nYou've made it clear.

She and Kayle are intrinsically linked, in a way that goes beyond the literal aspects of their relation.\n\nMorgana and Kayle are two sides of the same coin. Both champions are gray (or grey if you prefer) and both can be considered evil or good depending on what side you stand.\n\nMorgana fights for freedom, and she does so by using magics that taint her soul. She is willing to be a martyr for her cause, and will do anything to usurp (as I think it is literally quoted in her lore) \"Kayle's brand of tyranny\".\n\nKayle, is trying to bring peace to a divided world. The only way she knows how to bring that peace, is through an iron clad rule that smashes expression and freedoms. \"The lives of the many, outweigh the lives of the few.\" She is willing to go to any lengths to unite her people, even if it means donning a mask to hide her tears as she fights her sister.\n\nAnd this is the dichotomy. This is the MOST IMPORTANT PART of the sisters. There is no \"right\" side (unless you WANT it to be) Morgana is willing to do whatever it takes so that everyone may live in the happiness they *choose*. Whereas Kayle, will do whatever it takes so that everyone may live in the happiness *she deems fit*.\n\nMorgana gave up her wings, her birthright, her sister, her soul, to protect her people from a perceived evil.\nAnd Kayle's sacrifices are on par, for they both believe themselves to be fighting the true evil of their world.\n\nBut with the retcon, there is no reason for Morgana to come to Runeterra. There is no reason for Kayle to come and fight her here, rather than wait for her to return to their world where Kayle's forces give her an edge. The gaps left by this retcon hurt in this story. It doesn't disrupt the characters themselves or their dichotomy, but it hurts their reasons for being in Runeterra.\n\nAnd I cannot express enough but please, do NOT link them to Runeterra just because you can. Don't go the Trundle/Gragas-->Freljord route. Give them their world, even if you're not willing to explore it. Even if you want their actions to be on the plane of Runeterra, don't make them denizens of it.\n\nAt the end of the day, Morgana and Kayle are interchangeable. And that... That is what makes them special to me. No matter how you squint while looking, they are the same coin.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2015-03-19T09:18:05.339+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"I'm not saying that this is something we're working on (we're not right now, we've had some preliminary discussions on the subject of Kayle and Morgana, but not necessarily relating to what I'm about to ask), I'm just interested in your view on this aspect: if the duality and dichotomy of Kayle and Morgana's relationship was kept intact, but not presented through the lens of an alien world, but instead a part of Runeterra (perhaps not even an area explored previously—again, this is purely hypothesis, not an avenue being explored internally) would that be critically divergent from those characters as you already know them?\n\nI found it interesting that you pointed out the need to make them not Runeterran. I'm not going to go into the specifics on Trundle and Gragas (personally, I think Gragas would get serious frostbite of the nipple if he spent all of his time in the Freljord), but let's not equate one set of reasoning for tying one champion to a specific location to a completely different example. \n\nThe setting for a story will usually reflect, contrast or emphasize the key themes and conflicts being explored by the main characters in the story.

So that we can show and tell you what makes us so passionate about the champion, so we can tell you the new Ahri art isn't foxy enough, so we can tell you that Sion is fucking awesome, he looks like a supreme badass keep going this direction, that we can tell you that the Xerath rewrite feels flat and like he is now a trope.\n\nI don't want lores to be crowd-sourced, but let's be honest. The rewrites to fix up the retcon... Those aren't for new players. They aren't for the cash-cows that don't care about the backstory and only play the game for the game. Those stories, they're meant for us. The people attached to our characters, who want there story to CONTINUE. To work towards resolution, even if you don't want them to find it.

I stopped doing those threads for two main reasons:\n\n(1) I figured nobody at Narrative was actually reading the discussions.\n(2) I had no clue what was being worked on and what wasn't. What was the point of doing a Bandle City thread only to log in the next day and find out that, while i was working on Bandle City, Ionia got rewritten? It felt very \"shot in the dark\", and \"have discussions about all factions at once\" seemed like a drastically greater time commitment than I could manage.\n\nDoes that second point make sense? It's a bit early in the morning for me right now. Basically, my goal is to do what I can to allow for some real back-and-forth discussion on parts of the lore that Narrative is planning to expand, or (especially) to rewrite. Starting threads like those feels very shot-in-the-dark, because I don't know which factions (if any) are going to be getting major story updates soon, nor which are going to be most drastically changed.\n\nI'm not saying that discussion is only helpful where big changes are happening, but that's where it's most urgently needed. If you guys want to put out a bunch of Demacian stories that basically fit with the established vision of Demacia, some discussion would probably still be appropriate, but it's not the worst thing in the world if the community didn't have any input. Maybe the community wanted more about knights fighting dragons, and instead got more about paladins fighting necromancers; that's just not as serious a problem as would be, e.g.,  \"community wanted Demacians to be mostly \"Good\", but now they're grimdark fascists from Game of Thrones\".\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Jaredan,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=4TK7oKqj,comment-id=0004000800000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-03-19T08:56:55.094+0000)\n> \n> All of the cultures and areas of Valoran are being worked on, to some degree, right now.

But I think it would be helpful to get some clue as to which settings are being slated for the most drastic changes, if any.\n\nIf Narrative really does look at such threads, I wouldn't be averse to creating a thread for each major city state. It's not too tall of an order. But I'd rather start with whatever factions are potentially going to be having a lot of work done in the near future.\n\nI am, at least, glad to hear that no major rewrites are currently locked in.

It wasn't so much that people didn't like the new Trundle lore: it was that (people felt that) Trundle was erased and replaced with a brand new character who shared the same name and some visual traits. I was never that into Trundle, so I'm not in a good position to talk about the specifics there, but that's what \"Trundle'ing\" means: a retcon/rewrite so profound as to annihilate a character. I imagine it's how I'd feel if I came by one day and found out that Veigar's new backstory had him as Teemo's best friend, a cheerful but clumsy yordle with a big hat who's shy about anyone seeing his face and heroically battles Noxians for the good of Bandle City.

Not with the communication around it, which was flawed in many ways and Riot admitted it to be so, but the end result, the new Trundle, seems to be a good thing in Riots eyes.\n\nThis means that Riot would happily change other characters if they think a 'better' character comes out of it.\nOne cannot care too deeply about a character if one knows they can just be removed.\nA story cannot be engaging if the reader does not care about the characters.\n\n**A characters removal logically means character-based stories are no longer engaging.**\n\nNow this won't go up all the time, there's stories that are engaging without characters one cares about and I suspect some people happily invest in a character even with the knowledge that this investment could be gone tomorrow. \nI don't think this is the majority of people though, nor do I think that Riot aims to write stories where the reader doesn't have to care about the characters.\n\n***\n\nI don't think Riot aims to write stories that aren't engaging. Then why are you happy with removing or changing a character? \nWorst thing is, I'm fairly certain you could've kept Trundles character intact and had him be an unwilling leader, since he can't really leave his tribe without the IoW around to start anew.\n\nIf you want a Rioters response to the removal: http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=36508044#post36508044\n\nRunaan has a great post here explaining alot about the creation of the new troll.

It is simply assumed that only elements can be preserved.\n\nI do remember this post back in the day (which, back in my day, we called \"the past.\")\n\nFrom what I took of it at the time, and still do, an artist at Riot made an \"Ice Troll\" concept skin and the rest of the team thought \"This should be Trundle\" and snowballed from there.  From what I gathered then and since, \"Traditional Trundle\" was merely a clean up of his original VU work before they went in the new direction and was included as a sort of weak appeasement.\n\nRunaan's explanations were, to be blunt, weak.  Any lore connections between the Ice Troll and the Poop Troll story were pretty big stretches, to be nice, almost to the point of being fabrications.\n\n- - - - -\n\nLooking again at the post, I have to laugh at this section...\n\n>We explored evolving Trundle into a frost troll as a solution to the problem of his story feeling complete. For example, we tried stories like “ice of Freljord slowed the disease” or “the Ice Witch cured him,” but they felt like Band-Aid solutions to get from Story A to Story B. This would not have been meaningful character development; it would have been an excuse to move the story forward in an inorganic way. A fresh start allowed us to create a strong, compelling, and open-ended story for Trundle. \n\nSound familiar?  Let's make some minor changes...\n\n>We explored **removing the Institute of War through a major Lore event** as a solution to the problem of not being able to explore new stories.  For example, we tried stories like \"Demacia and Noxus unite to compel the Institute to disband\" or \"Sabotage from Zaun destroyed the Institute,\" but they felt like Band-Aid solutions to get from Story A to Story B.  This would not have been meaningful world development;  it would have been excuse to move the entire lore forward in an inorganic way.  A fresh start allows us to create a strong, compelling and open-ended mythology for Runeterra.\n\nInteresting, isn't it?

Lots of insight here and it sounds like good stuff. This is highly encouraging.\n\n> It is clear that the old lore had many quality and highly usable pieces, and we'll be including many of them.\n\nThat'll be difficult without the IoW, as well as with some other direction decisions I'm seeing (less weirdness in favor of more dark/spook, less connectivity in favor of firmer boundaries, less breadth in favor of a harder Runeterran focus). I'm skeptical.\n\n> Quick question: what is it about Cass that you think has changed to her detriment?\n\nIn terms of lore? Not a ton. I mean, she came across as way too blunt, and the fact that she went from \"overconfident seductress\" to \"genre-blind backstabber\" isn't insignificant, but a lot of her core can still work (Du Coteau, subtle, greedy). The main problem is that a lot of old lore is in a canonical grey spot, so I'm not sure if she still has her background of being a political power player in contrast to her sister's tomboyish adventuring. I assume she does, and it just needs to be put back in the spotlight for her instead of \"here's this one stupid thing she did now she's Medusa\".\n\nHer kit rework was impressively bad, though. We said that her E was the least satisfying and thematic part of her kit, and then it got emphasized. We said that her manipulative and subtle nature should be more emphasized, and she went from a long-range DoT mage to a mid-range skirmish spamcaster. We said that she'd get raw number buffs until she was OP and that then there would be no further changes made, and that's exactly what happened. We said her kit changes wouldn't stop her from being a lane bully unless she was simply impotent in lane, and that also turned out to be totally true.\n\nCONTRAST THIS WITH XERATH. Xelnath came in and chatted with us about what we thought was cool about him, and the community shouted \"long range artillery!\" and \"low mobility siege mage!\" Then Xelnath tossed a few ideas around with us and we got hyped as heckarooni. Now Xerath is in a really healthy place, with a super coherent identity and is usable with clear strengths and weaknesses. That was one of the best reworks we've ever seen, easily.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2015-03-19T10:39:43.178+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":4,"body":"I can't respond with detail mainly as I'm beginning to drool (bloody hell it's ugly), but your supposition that she hasn't changed much is absolutely correct.

It seems clear, at least to those passionate enough to speak up about it, that the direction is disliked far more than appreciated, so when you say you listen, but do it your way (how else should this be interpreted?), it frustrates people.\n\nYou ask questions, want feedback, then choose to ignore said feedback and go with what you want anyways. It may not be the intent, and I apologize if my tone is frustration over understanding (as Ive said, I've been here for a while, so I've seen/heard it all from you guys), but a lot of what we are told is \"we get it, you want X, but we are Riot so we are giving you Y. We understand you prefer X, and don't like Y, but you are getting Y\". This is a very frustrating thing to see/hear/read, because you ask for feedback, but it is completely ignored (I could give very clear and well thought out examples, but that would be a wall of text no one wants to read), and if it isn't ignored, then it is most assuredly disregarded at the very least. \n\nIt is starting to feel like you guys (I'm again, specifically pointing this comment at the narrative/lore/whatever you want to call it team), tend to take in, then simply give back what you guys want out of the story. No one on that team can believe what you are giving is fully okay, especially when you make comments like us not being able to stop you from making another Trundle, that is bad, that is wrong, and that is why people turn from trying to have a civil discussion to angry. You can't go from saying you want feedback, then telling us that we can't stop you from making another champion into one of the most hated (yes I used hate, it is a strong word for a strong feeling) champion lore reworks we have been given. \n\nAt the end of the day, you are the guys writing the lore now, and you will do with it what you will, but it is becoming a trend that players don't trust your vision, especially when it is clear we don't like it (I say we, because there is a small percentage that are vocal that agree with the changes), and ask yourself this honest question;* shouldn't us, the players, liking the end result be more important than YOU liking the end result?*","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"OJ191","date":"2015-03-19T11:05:16.108+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jaredan,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=4TK7oKqj,comment-id=000400080000,timestamp=2015-03-19T06:31:27.932+0000)\n>\n> It was either communicate before we had a full raft of content set up, or wait until it was ready (and that would have meant a longer period of silence, which we wanted to avoid).\n\nYou can feel free to communicate before you have a full raft of content set up, but instead of merely **communicating** you went ahead and released your unfinished bug ridden (lol \"tech issues\") retcon before it was even 1/4 ready.\n\nReleasing the retcon without having all the replacement content ready and tech issues ironed out was **foolhardy**, **irresponsible**, and down right **rude** to lore fans.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
