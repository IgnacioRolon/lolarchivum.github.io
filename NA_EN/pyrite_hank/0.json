He submitted a support ticket but since the account is old he couldn't remember the first champions, skins or refunds he had purchased or used - of course he wouldn't, who would - and now the theif is playing ranked games and feeding on his account. aplaenx is diamond 5, and if you look him up on opgg, you'll notice the most recent games, starting with a 6/8/4 draven game, have been all losses and he now buys control wards, something that you'll notice he's never done in a ranked game before. Player support refused to help since he didn't remember the first anything, but he offered to show proof that he owned the debit card that was making rp purchases and was on the ip which it had been playing from before the account got taken. This was a very valuable account and he would really like it back, but player support has been less than helpful, what can we possibly do now that some account theif is feeding in his ranked games?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-07T21:29:02.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Our account team won't give account access unless they're absolutely sure it's being returned to the owner.  Any evidence he can offer certainly helps, but if they aren't giving it to him then there's some reason for that.  It's totally okay for him to try again, just have him fill out an [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416).  Sorry it's been a pain, and I hope he can get his account back!","replies":[{"poster":"Pyrite Hank","date":"2017-07-07T23:22:40.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, wasn't sure if he could try again, i'll get it to him right away","replies":[]}]}]}
