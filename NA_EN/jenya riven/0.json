I have re-installed League of legends. I have been running many programs which checked and confirmed that all of my drivers were up to date as much as they can be. Know i do not see the issue in my computer, I'm sure that it is something to do with the patch as this only started happening as soon as I upgraded to patch 7.1. However I am able to run the game because of the  Alt+enter trick that @Porocles told me to do .This opens up the game in windowed screen. However I am not able to play the game in windowed screen because I get very high fps spikes which makes the game unplayable, I did try running it in borderless more which lagged out my PC even more. Just for the information my computer is really old, I do think this might be a reason for the game not being able to open in full screen, Cant my GPU be optimized for the new standards of the 7.1 patch???? \nPlease someone help, I would love to get back into playing my favorite game and spending a lot of money on the upcoming goodness.\nI would love to get help from someone, thank you.\n\nJenya{{champion:74}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:74}} ","replies":[{"poster":"JayDragonMaster2","date":"2017-01-14T11:22:37.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so bro it worked for me\njust go to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config \nand open game.cfg and change WindowMode=1 or 0 to WindowMode=2\nAnd the game will work in borderless fullscreen\nif ur issues still continues Just post again and i will try my best to solve the prob\n\n\n\n                                                                                        Frm a fellow summoner","replies":[{"poster":"JayDragonMaster2","date":"2017-01-14T11:25:21.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Btw try lowering ur video setting on after changing windowmode= to windowmode 2\nand if it is still lagging u could gimme ur skype or something and i will be happy to help\nor just add me on EUW server\nI m sure u will e able to play again","replies":[]}]}]}]}
