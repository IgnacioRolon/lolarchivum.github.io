This was useful for setting up counterpicks and reducing the amount of trading required.\r\n\r\nStarting right before the season ended, this functionality (bug or feature) was lost to us. However, it hasn’t become random - rather, our players appear in the same exact pick order in every champion select, regardless of which player makes the game or what order players are invited, or any other variable that we can determine. Having our typical midlaner always pick first and our usual support always pick last is less than ideal.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what controls this? Even a random order would be better than what’s happening now.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-29T04:58:17.956+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Y'know, I don't actually think it was ever intended for you to be able to confirm the pick order every time like that tbh. I know the current matchmaking for sure doesn't have this kind of feature afaik, but I'm gonna make sure to ask around how this might have worked in the past and what changed if anything!","replies":[{"poster":"Gleekus","date":"2017-11-29T20:06:48.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for responding! I thought it might have been more bug than feature in the past, so I really don’t mind losing control of the order, but being stuck in the same (bad) order every match is pretty annoying.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Robert Puckett","date":"2018-02-24T07:22:58.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"BUMP.
