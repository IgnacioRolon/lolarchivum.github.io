This would be for any type of queue, nice option Checkbox so I don&#039;t waste my time against 2-5 people huddled in a Ventrillo or Skype session using third party resources I don&#039;t have access too.  \r\n\r\nMy account is so old I also notice I may win several games in a row, and then suddenly get matched with teammates who play like they just got their accounts from a friend.  Decided to post on this because I think Match maker is using my account as a &quot;keystone&quot; on a team of lesser skilled to somehow balance it out against an enemy team with a premade mixed into it.   \r\n\r\nAs of late when I notice the enemy team has several people sporting same clan tags, Ill just wiggle my mouse and afk/hangout near respawn.  I may actually owe Riot a thank you, because I actually got a downstairs sink project done that&#039;d been lingering for weeks.  :)","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-01-10T22:03:16.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2-5 people?
