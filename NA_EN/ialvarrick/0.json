I've noticed some of our Northern Friends have been experiencing some shifts in latency due to some routing issues with some ISP's to our servers. If you'd like, we can take a look at some traceroutes if you grab the networking app called [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/). Simply plug in **104.160.131.1** into the focus address area, then start the trace. After it's run for 5 minutes, export the results as text and paste them in a reply to me.\n\nLet me know if you have any issues running this traceroute.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kantoweru","date":"2016-10-26T00:55:48.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're not alone.
