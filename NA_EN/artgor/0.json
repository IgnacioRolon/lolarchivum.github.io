The gamblers foibles was gambling, he gambled everything (even his life), which is why the demon took everything he loved (which was the life he had), such path he took with the deal bit him in the ass. He thought he would be safe of his demons, but once you let them in your life, you are a fool that let it in and screwed yourself in the long process. \n\nAlso as many rioters have pointed out in the Q&A, the demon encountered many champions (which means many champions have this inner demon inside them) some as fellows or adversaries (those that are consumed by their inner demons, and those that overcome them).  \n\nBut the fun thing about Runeterra is that even your inner demons take shape in the physical world. Ill take Game of Thrones world any day now since I now even worse things exist in this setting.\n\nRegardless, I really like the concept behind this champion, the demon thing is something unique.

Years later he met a beautiful woman and asked her to marry him. She said yes and the wedding became a cause of celebration across the whole town. However at the altar the swamp spirit/demon came to claim his end of the bargain. He entered Tahm Kench ,transformed him into the monster we see in the game, now corrupted by the demon he devoured every single guest including his own bride.
