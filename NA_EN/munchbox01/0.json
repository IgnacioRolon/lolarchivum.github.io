That's a good thing, but it means that tanks and bruisers will likely be stacking less armor in the game, and can just as easily stack MR to counter an APC if needed.  All in all, that's good since it encourages intelligently tailoring your build based on the enemy damage composition, but it is an indirect buff to AD damage dealers and nerf to magic damage dealers.  So AD would likely need nerfs to their damage output and tank shredding capabilities, while magic damage dealers, or at least sustained magic damage dealers who can potentially bust tanks, would likely need buffs to deal with the extra Magic Resistance.\n\nDone properly, this could be a big improvement to the game.  It could even be a major step to class diversity in bot lane, since APC sustain damage carries would need nearly equal tank-busting and damage output potential to marksmen since resistances could be more fairly stacked in either direction.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HaIlMonitor","date":"2017-08-13T21:02:11.576+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think towers should start out super strong and punish people, but then get weaker over the game to where they do.
