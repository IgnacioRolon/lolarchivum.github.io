After patch 5.16, even though i have the ward skin checked as being used, it doesn&#039;t load in game, and the Kalista skin isn&#039;t being recognized as owned on my account, as it still prompts me to purchase it at the skin selection screen. I don&#039;t know if this has been happening to anyone else in a similar outlet, but if this is a glitch i&#039;d like to be compensated and get my skin back. Thoughts? Solutions?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-26T16:27:59.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Spears are Hard,\n\nIf content gifted to you is now missing, there are usually two possible reasons - \n\n1) If a player participates in Refer-A-Friend fraud to acquire IP or RP, then any champions/skins gifted with this IP or RP are removed.\n\n2) If a player purchases RP and gifts content with it, and subsequently issues a chargeback for the money spent on that RP, we will remove that content.\n\nIf you don't think either of these scenarios are why you're missing content, please feel free to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so we can investigate the issue further.","replies":[]}]}
