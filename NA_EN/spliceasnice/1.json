Pantheon holds the \"always wins lane, still falls off\" niche although his ganks are very nice.\n\nIrelia's nerf is not big at all, but she is still nowhere near as strong as Sion anyway. Basically top lane tiers right now are Sion>Irelia>everyone else relatively balanced.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"wop","date":"2015-03-15T23:01:07.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:92}} Riven is so easy to get fed early game, and it just takes 1-2 kills for her to be \"fed\"\n\nIf you manage to get the first few kills in your lane, you are most likely going to win it IMO","replies":[{"poster":"OoohCreamy","date":"2015-03-15T23:12:23.324+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"but riven can be shut down just as easily as any other champs. her counter is CC. so don't expect to be a god in lane early just saying riven gets overhyped too much. you cant play her and win everything lol she does good if played well","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AFK Push","date":"2015-03-22T16:03:19.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want to main a top lane champ for ranked, take some things into mind. If they are always on the nerf/buff train, they probably aren't worth maining (new champs mostly). If they are really only considered strong at certain points in the game, then maybe you want somebody relevant throughout the whole game. You also have to know if they are getting banned left and right due to how strong they are. For instance, {{champion:39}} has a pick of 14% but a banrate of 37%. What's the point of maining a champ (or even learning the champ) if you can't play them 1/3 of all games. With all of these things in mind and considering how strong certain champs are right now, I would recommend {{champion:62}}. He has a decent early game to snowball you, but has an amazing mid game so even if you don't do much early you can easily come back with roams and teamfights.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hooligan inc","date":"2015-03-16T00:03:27.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:80}} \nweq combo \nmust I say more","replies":[{"poster":"doom bot 82 ","date":"2015-03-16T18:18:10.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"qweq combo is better","replies":[{"poster":"Hooligan inc","date":"2015-03-17T01:08:07.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"qweq {{summoner:14}} forgot that","replies":[{"poster":"doom bot 82 ","date":"2015-03-17T05:22:52.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"qwe aa taimant q {{summoner:14}}","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hellish Prophecy","date":"2015-03-17T04:22:34.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wukong is actually a pretty good choice.
