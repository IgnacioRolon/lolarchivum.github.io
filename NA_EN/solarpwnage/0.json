Before I made this post, I kinda already... knew why and what image it looks familiar to. \n\nI want to show you the concept art that I drew 3 month ago but published 2 months ago, also here is a link to a post i published on the boards two month ago. Now what I find strikingly familiar is my torso armor to Victorious Sivir's torso armor. When I first saw the Victorious Splash art I immediately got excited that perhaps a Riot artist (Johnathan Lee) perhaps took inspiration from my art and incorporated it into the splash art. My original purpose of this post was to find out if... perhaps it was inspired by my work, I didn't expected to get an answer so quickly that it in fact took me by surprise! I just want to thank you for your time and I just wanted to bring this up. \n\nBut in the end I guess he didn't take inspiration from my work like I hoped, that's fine and again thank you for your time.\n\n\n(My Post)\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/fancreations/pZIA5xNV-art-of-league-help-me-with-feedback\n\n(My Art)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ktFzSDt.jpg[/img]     \n\n(Sivir's Art)\nhttps://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xat1/t51.2885-15/s480x480/e35/12142280_958642937525276_609085715_n.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2015-11-12T21:19:01.049+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SolarPWNage,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=tZcvAuut,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-11-12T06:20:59.269+0000)\n>\n> Alright, I want to apologize for one thing To you KindleJack.
