I do not have the option to reconnect, the screen simply freezes and says, \"Attempting to reconnect.\" This is very frustrating as it costs me games and time. I can assure its not my internet as I am posting this as I am \"attempting to reconnect.\" This is very infuriating, please fix this riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-12T17:54:56.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The random nature of these disconnects might suggest an unstable connection, which is having trouble getting to the game server.  I know this is frustrating, so I recommend sticking to custom games to troubleshoot for now.
