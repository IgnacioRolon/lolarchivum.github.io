I mean, why play amunu for his 1 stun and aoe snare when you could play Ekko with his aoe STUN and insane damage output, or Hecarim with his insane speed, or Vi with her TWO knock ups, or any of dozens of non-tank champs who can outshine him or any other tank for that matter.  As a tank main I find it harder and harder to play the champs I love(tanks) when so many brusiers do my job better than I can.  When you do see tanks in play it is always supp.  Which by the way makes our job that much harder since now we are responsible for the safety of the team but have to do without any real farm.  I mean look at the current line up of Primary tanks(nont champs like mundo or chgath): {{champion:12}} : who is not seen outside of support very often; {{champion:32}} : Who was discussed here and why he is falling behind; {{champion:53}} : who has always been more of a bruiser in my opinion but even so is supp and banned pretty regularly in lower elo; Cho would be next in Riots list but he does not even fit the 3 rules to being a tank that they put forth so screw him; {{champion:3}} : My main, one of the best champs in the game when you know what to do his shield increases Armor and Mr of the target and then heals him when the target takes damage(effectively increases both his and his targets survivability), an aoe slow that does decent damage, an aoe speed boost so allies can follow him into combat, and a aoe 2 second taunt, in all honesty he should see more play with that kind of kit but most do not realize how useful he can still be; {{champion:59}} : who I do not see a lot of since they nerfed him a while back, but would be one fo the few who stayed relevant if not for the nerf stick; {{champion:89}} : who is still pretty relevant but only in a support role which is pretty bad since I have witnessed both jung leo and mid leo trash their opponents; {{champion:54}} : who only has 1 hard cc which is his ult and I only see him paired with Kallista for wombo combo fodder; {{champion:57}} : speaking of nerf sticks.... he once owned top, now you do not see him anywhere; {{champion:111}} : probably the only champ in this list I still see regularly outside of supp, and with good reason since they cannot nerf him(except for minor tweaks) or he will be literally useless but cannot buff him because he would be unstoppable; {{champion:78}} : with her rework she was DESTROYING people, then she got nerfed and she kind of is fading again; {{champion:33}} : Still a solid champ, but does not see a whole lot of play because he is not a bruiser who will get more kills than assists; {{champion:113}} : another solid champ who just gets out classed in most match ups; {{champion:98}} : I did not see him much following his rework but have noticed more and more of him recently, probably do to his bruiser like build paths and playstyle; {{champion:27}} : not much to say here, I have seen maybe 1 singed in the past month, he is pretty much the dead horse you do not beat; {{champion:14}} : again another rework followed by nerfs, they make these champs to be good then realize that tanks are unkillable so they nerf the damage output and pretty much ruin their viability; {{champion:154}} : Not sure why he does not see more play either, I still play him, and still do really well, again just think people would rather have that \"Dunkmaster\" feel from Vi or Darius.  Sorry for the wall of text, but one more thing before I go: The three things riot says a tank needs are: 1) survivability   2) Peel/remain a threat   3) initiation.  The last is why I feel Cho does not belong with the others, he has no dash or speed boost or any thing.  He relies on catching with his q which is hardly the same.\n\nI mean compared to {{champion:122}} , {{champion:36}} , {{champion:245}} , {{champion:60}} , {{champion:120}} , {{champion:420}} , {{champion:24}} , and others like them who is really going to pick a true tank.  We do not do damage, we do not even have as much peel as most fighters released these days, and they have just as much survivability.  So why play tanks?  I do not know, maybe because i like life in hard mode, maybe I just like being the designated butthole that gets pounded so no one else does, I can not say that I have any reason I cotinue to back this dying breed of champs.  One thing is for sure, if things do not change tanks will die out completely and no one will even notice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Articality","date":"2016-08-23T23:45:07.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:1401}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3151}}  Useless?!

If you think Gragas or Reksai is better in soloQ, you're so wrong. These are champions who have a kit that are WAY better in organized team play but because of that, they have received so many nerfs that they are below average for soloQ players. Even if you're diamond, the picks in LCS mean nothing to you because they're based on a very different meta. A meta where players play like a team and not just individuals with a common goal. You can't pick Amumu in LCS because the enemy team will exploit his weaknesses. Your early game presence will be 0 and they will make sure you never get out of your jungle and lategame they will just split push the brains out of him so he will never get a 4 or 5 man ult. In soloQ, however, people will not be able to organize their team around countering amumu and you will probably get easy ganks in at least one of the lanes and having an obvious initiator is just so insanely strong in soloQ teamfights. You can't flash and knock up with rek'sai and expect your team to be hitting them instantly. You need a more obvious engage that lasts longer.","replies":[]}]}
