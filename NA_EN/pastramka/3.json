For them to ensure that the 'ideal method' of buying RP isn't for an American player to come to Canada and buy here, they have to ensure the cost is comparable given that being the case. Because if the ideal method is that then THEY as a company lose money on the exchange rate...\n\nIt's also bad for business if you, as a company, are actively encouraging your largest market to go somewhere else to buy your goods because they're getting a significantly better price.(which is what would be the case if they hadn't altered the prices). \n\nI don't LIKE that these things are factors that have to be taken into account... but I recognize that they are.

Origin has some issues to work out... but they have a LOT fewer issues than Steam did in its first few years(look up the release of half-life 2 it's widely considered to be one of the most disastrous game releases in history)... but at a general level, Origin has a lot of features that Steam is really lacking... but Origin gets such a negative rap due to the fact that it is an EA product(and for some strange reason EA is on the opposite end of the spectrum... whereas Valve could practically get away with murder and not be criticized for it, EA can't even release a good game without being criticized for it... it's kind of hilarious to watch the double standards at work) and the fact that it had a relatively bad launch period.

I think Riot has a hard task and does relatively well, and they're finally moving in a direction that will allow them to balance things in a less seesaw fashion. They're not THERE yet, but they're on a good track.\n\nI don't see why you're including me in on this rant, not one point in this rant applies to me at all.
