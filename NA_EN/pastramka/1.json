Then the normal timer starts and the Captain gets to decide which of the champions to ban. Since everyone can see which champions are about to be banned they will be quicker in stating whether they will use that champion or not. Then its the enemies turn, they go through the same process, back to your teams turn.

There are plenty of enough champs and if anything, just increase the free champ rotation by a few more champs to ensure that everyone can get a pick even if they don't own any other champs.\n\nBut a simple solution for what you're talking about would be to just let the other 4 people pick up to 3 champs to ban from their own pick screen (toggle up to 3 champs) and for the captain, they would see a red outline around preferred champ bans... The more ban votes for one champ, the brighter/thicker the outline could be.\n\nSo if say, 1 person wants Orianna banned, then it would have a 2 pixel red outline around Orianna for the captain's champ screen. If 4 people wanted Orianna banned, then it would have a 8 pixel red outline around Orianna.\n\nI would say you'd need to give maybe 10 seconds time before the captain could start banning though, so at least this gives the other 4 team members a chance to pick their 3 ban votes.\n\nBut again, the most elegant solution is to stop giving all the power to first pick and equally distribute the power to all 5 players.\n\n\nEither that, or use the system I described as a sort of democratic voting system... The game would look at all 5 player's 3 ban votes, and then ban champions based on vote count and then random pick for any tied votes. For example, if 5 players all voted for 3 picks, and maybe Lee Sin got the most votes (say, 3 or something) then Lee Sin would be banned... then whatever champ had 2 votes, then if only 1 vote champs are left, the game would randomly choose out of those... so everyone has an equal chance to get their bans in.\n\nI realize this really doesn't work for 5v5 premades or for LCS... but for Solo Q I feel like we need a different option for banning, as the idea of \"1st pick gets to make all the bans\" seems quite unfair.\n\nDefinitely we need different ban setups for solo q and for 5v5s.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dr Easter","date":"2015-03-06T20:44:33.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Display the ban people want?

Other Summoners vote. Maybe have three options: \"Yes\", \"Meh\", or \"No\".\n\nThis reminds me of another topic. I really feel like it would be beneficial if we could pre-set certain preferences that would be automatically displayed in champ select. I get tired of typing the same things out every time. Sure, some of this is situational, but the first move is almost always going to be people sharing their preferences. Some examples:\n\n* **Role preferences.** Let people indicate their best role, their second-best role, and the role they're worst at. They could appear as little icons. This would make it SO MUCH EASIER to work out who's going where. Right now, every match begins with people typing in their preferred roles.\n* **Ban preferences.** I wouldn't be averse to letting Summoners leisurely pick out a set of Champions they most want to see banned from their games, and having that aggregate displayed to the captain at the start of each match.\n* **Champion preferences.** Maybe let people select a few of their favorite Champions and show them. Perhaps this could be fused with \"role preferences\" to save space. This would not only help people get a sense of who people like to play, but would also help serve as indication to the captain as to whom not to ban.\n\nI guess one behavioral downside is that people might get snippy if the captain doesn't follow their preferences, but that already happens.\n\nI'd much rather set something in my profile that says \"prefer mid or support, really bad at ADC\" rather than having to type that out every match. I'd also like to be able to see other Summoners' preferences, even if they go afk while waiting for their turn.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Keagn","date":"2015-03-05T22:24:06.135+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Couldn't agree more.
