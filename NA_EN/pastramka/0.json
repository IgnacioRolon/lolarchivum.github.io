In this input one writes a little message, if one wants naturally, it wont be mandatory.\r\n\r\nAnd then in a page in the summoners profile there will be an \"Honor wall\" with icons from the Summoners champions from that game that gave the comment, something like this :\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/FsrvYXN.png\r\n\r\nI guess summoners that commented should be anonymous to visitors to the wall, But the owner can visit the commentator's profile by clicking the champion icon.\r\nThe comments must be approved by the owner for public display, so there wont be comments like \"Biggest KS-er NA! FU!\".\r\n\r\nIf a comment is not approved after a week it can be auto deleted, so if one does not wont to bother wont have to.\r\n\r\nThis can be also a good opportunity for a gift summoner icon from Riot: \"1k approved Honor comment\" icon.","replies":[{"poster":"Killer X 12","date":"2015-02-14T23:56:53.832+0000","up_votes":59,"down_votes":2,"body":"As long as you can report people who send you rude shit, yea.","replies":[{"poster":"jQuery","date":"2015-02-15T00:04:11.381+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, that's a good idea, a third button for reporting offensive comments.\n\n3 reports - never again can the summoner comment on an honor point.","replies":[{"poster":"Pastramka","date":"2015-02-15T00:08:39.147+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be nice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rock Rockburgh","date":"2015-02-15T04:24:39.647+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"It definitely shouldn't be permanent.

Honor banners literally mean you are among the most positive players in the game, going beyond simply not being toxic. No, in order to get Honor Banners, you need to actively behave in a positive manner, consistently.

With the 30-50-80 limit, you have the best of the ones you've received, and they can put in a counter for every comment you've had, the saved, new, and deleted ones.\n\nI can pretty much guarantee that if the Player Behavior team DID make a system like this, they would keep the smaller limit. Not only would it save data space (say hello to our lack of saved replays), but it would keep each one you get ***-special-***, making you want to earn more not just for a number, but to keep your inbox new and unique over the run of a season.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
