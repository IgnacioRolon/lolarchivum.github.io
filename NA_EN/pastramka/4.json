Anything, any tip at all, just trow it below!\r\n\r\nI play only couple games a week, don't play ranked and its usually a team builder (so no bans). I go support or jungle.\r\n\r\nWhen i jungle i can have a bit more influence...\r\n\r\nBut when im playing support... I mean what do I do? I see less and less Zeds roam bot, but after lvl 12 there is very little i can do to slow him down as a support.He is like *chak-chak* - 1.5 sec and my adc is dead, I was of no use....\r\n\r\nMy only hope is to pick {{champion:117}} forever and to save all the \"**Cuddly incoming**\"s for him and hope that my team does not miss the opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo anything you have, please share.\r\n\r\nhttp://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/14/144096/3368430-4864233108-IDW20.png\r\n\r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Wullf","date":"2015-02-26T11:43:12.062+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{summoner:3}} - best thing against him\n\n{{item:3092}} {{champion:267}} {{item:3222}} - pretty effective\nI was also able to keep {{champion:238}} from my ADC with {{champion:412}} \n\nalso {{champion:40}} {{champion:16}} (remember her silence pool?) {{champion:1}} {{champion:37}} (and I also had some sucess with {{champion:161}} )\n\nyou can play effectively against Zed almost with anything.\n\n\nCannot say for jungle.
