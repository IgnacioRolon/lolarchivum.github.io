They are so tough to the cold that they don't need layers and fur. They have adapted to their environment and embrace the cold. At least, that's what I take away from it.\n\nBut back on the main topic... I've sorted the overly sexualized female characters to the more modest ones:\n\nSexual:\n{{champion:103}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:22}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:143}} \n\nModest:\n{{champion:34}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:254}} \n\nSome are borderline either side... I based my decision on how the characters were dressed/portrayed. Like for example, Sona has a big bust, but she wears a pretty traditional dress and isn't really that intentionally \"exposed\" aside from some cleavage... but I can see the cleavage being TOO emphasized so she might go in either category. Some of the modest champs have really emphasized bodies but are at least covered up... even if it's like skin tight outfits.\n\nBut I mean, again, this all depends on what you find modest or overly sexy or whatever... I'm defining it by showing skin for no other reason than to show skin. Like champs wearing bras/bikini tops or visible thongs or basically bondage gear.","replies":[{"poster":"KING OF MASKS","date":"2015-02-20T00:29:56.320+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ahri being sexualized is kind of the point of her character, though.","replies":[{"poster":"Konidias","date":"2015-02-20T18:31:47.177+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KING OF MASKS,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=UIKvcJfH,comment-id=00030000000000000000000000020000,timestamp=2015-02-20T00:29:56.320+0000)\n>\n> Ahri being sexualized is kind of the point of her character, though.\n\nEh...

I'm sure you bundle up and put the heat on and everything... so there is no reason your body would like adapt to colder temperatures when you are using clothes and heat sources to keep it warm. :P\n\nBut again, these are fictional characters with magical abilities, so it's not unfair to say that some of them might have adapted to cold temps.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TwoD","date":"2015-02-20T05:39:09.904+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Fiora and Vi not sexual??? you cray","replies":[{"poster":"Konidias","date":"2015-02-20T18:20:21.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TwoD,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=UIKvcJfH,comment-id=00030000000000000000000000020001,timestamp=2015-02-20T05:39:09.904+0000)\n>\n> Fiora and Vi not sexual??? you cray\n\nAgain, I based it on how much skin they are showing unnecessarily.
