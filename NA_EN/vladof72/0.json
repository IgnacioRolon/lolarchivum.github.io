Right now I can't build mastery pages or fix runes as it keeps interrupting me all the time, and I'm too afraid to try and get into a game so I won't get punished for ruining a game for 4 other people.\n\nThis issue only happens to me in LoL. I play plenty of other online multiplayer and never had any problems in the last year.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-31T15:48:17.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Though you initially made it past the authentication server, is seems like an unstable connection is kicking out off pvp.net.  My suggestion ehre would be to go over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot and remove any blocks.\n\nYou can also grab our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and auto-configure your firewall settings as an added step.

I was getting a message saying there's problems connecting to the server and that I should check my internet connection.\n\n\nIt seems like my client REALLY doesn't like me trying to edit my mastery pages, to the point that after interrupting me editing them a few times I can't get into my mastery pages at all. Not in the collection tab and not while in champ select.","replies":[{"poster":"blizzardlike","date":"2017-09-11T11:14:52.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same issue and I am not able to fix it. It's only in the new client. Ingame, everything works perfect without any ping drops or whatever. But in the client, trying to accept games or changing masteries while champion select, or while banning, picking, i often get knocked out with these connection errors.\nI am not able to ban a champ -> kicked out of game.\nI am not able to accept a game -> Queue ban for 15 minutes.\nOften the system doesn't tell me that there is a game to accept and often i click accept and the system tells me, that I haven't accepted.\n\nThis really annoys me a lot.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"zayin b eyein","date":"2017-10-11T18:39:26.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the exact same issue. The client regularly crashes out of game like this, and sometimes the queue will never pop and it is really annoying, but once in game I'm fine no problem.
