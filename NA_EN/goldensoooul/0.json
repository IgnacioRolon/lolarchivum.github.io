It'll say I have a certain amount(Ex.4800) and I goto buy a champion and It would say not enough IP. So then I would relog and then my IP would drop by 100.

You should be able to resolve this by swapping over to the Legacy Client (from Login) in order to visit the store and cause another sync of your IP value with the servers.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/215576628/Launch-Legacy-Client.jpg\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenSoooul","date":"2017-02-27T22:29:42.601+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"UpooOnMe","date":"2017-02-26T21:26:17.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had this same problem. It's a bug where your IP displayed is not synced with the actual amount in Riot's database.
