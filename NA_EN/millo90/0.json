I mean i'm unranked, why i'm with/against ppl who are highly above my elo, it doesnt make any  sense. Riot seriously need to look on matchmaking system..\n\nthats exactly my issue. im not ranked yet and would like to play with a friend to improve. but whenever i queue with him we are against people with 500-1k wins whereas we are at 102 and 75 wins( bronze and silver players vs my team that is all unranked) . of course if u play and win for long and have those kinda wins means u have more experience in the game. my team wont ward well for example or dont know how to last hit or is not familliar with all champs yet, so im bummed out that i keep facing people that obviously are pro in the game and our team gets trashed cause i queue with a friend..... when i queue solo i get a little more balanced mm for sure.\n\ni mean i dont even have enough runes yet for 2 builds...\n\ni used to play prime world and there is only pvp and u have rankings from beginning. u start at 1100 and will only be matched vs 1100 if u queue with a friend that is 1200 u will be pulled up to 1200 though but it doesnt happen that u are vs high ranks like 2000. but in most of the mobas id u are in a 3+ premade ull be upscaled which is though. yes, premades are mostlikely on ts or so but one shouldnt be punished if u want to play and learn with a friend.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WÃ®nter Fox","date":"2015-01-06T00:33:22.672+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm Gold 5 in ranked.

So a platinum can play  as {{champion:121}} for the first few times in team builder and stomp everyone because he's more experienced and a better player but team builder treats him like a bronze because he's playing a new champ.\n\n-This literally happened to me a plat kha six vs my team of all bronze ranks.
