The /Remake system marks anyone as \"inactive\" if they don't take action for 90 seconds within the first 3 minutes of the match. It's a good idea to continue playing normally even if someone has yet to connect since they could come back before the match is eligible for a Remake. If they come back and all their teammates were AFK waiting for a remake, now their whole team is behind rather than just them. \n\nFor complete details, check out our [/Remake FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ).
