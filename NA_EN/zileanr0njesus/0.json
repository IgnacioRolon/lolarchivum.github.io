Since then, I&#039;d like to think that I&#039;ve improved my self-control and have reformed. \n\nThat being said, I keep trying to keep a clean slate and level up my honor but ive played around 100 games since my ban and I am still Honor 0. Based on the new PBE Honor update, are there any plans for a progress indicator for getting out of dishonorable ranks?\n\nIt doesn&#039;t have to be &quot;play x games without being reported&quot;. Literally something as little as a pop up saying &quot;You&#039;ve been improving your behavior. Keep it up and you will regain honor rewards!&quot; \n\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2017-12-12T22:30:30.956+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is a good point.
