Becuase of me being a support main I feel compelled to help all lanes 24/7, and I don&#039;t know if this is  a good thing to do.

However if your ganks are failing then you will quickly find yourself falling behind in levels and gold compared to your enemies.\n\nI would recommend you try and get a couple camps between ganks unless you see really good opportunities for kills. \n\nIf you find that your allies don't seem to be competent enough to carry you (i.e. playing badly, throwing away any lead you give them, making questionable decisions), then it is generally a bad idea to try and get them ahead.  You can still gank for them if you want to, but that is generally to (1) stem the bleeding and (2) get yourself fed enough to carry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OurLestrade","date":"2016-04-29T18:27:05.915+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support/Fill main myself so I get tossed into jungle a fair bit, ganking is always good but you always need to remember that you have your own gold and experience flow to think about too.

Then there are champs like Shyvana who'd rather farm up than gank.\n\nI think the general rule of thumb is you want to gank when your ult is up.\n\n> I mean if the gank is successful then they get a better chance winning their lane, sure my farm and levels are far behind, but it's worth if all other lanes win, right?\n\nIn the end, laners need to be able to take care of themselves and the only ones who you should be interested in ganking for are people who are winning their lanes.  If someone is having a rough time but hasn't fallen behind, you might want to make an appearance to take some of the pressure off.  However if someone is falling behind, he's frankly not worth your time and is a risk to gank for.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jaymc1130","date":"2016-04-29T19:51:49.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are ganking successfully (securing summoners and/or kills and taking objectives after you succeed) then there is no such thing as \"too much ganking\".

There's more to jungling then ganking where as you put helping 24/7.\n\nA few starters would be...\n\nTry for first blood, watch the minimap see what opposing lane is late to show up. You then know where the enemy started and can catch him at his next camp\n\nDon't gank lanes that are feeding and I can't stress this enough because you see it far to often. If the lane is already fed and you're not odds are you will only feed them more.  Instead what you should focus is helping lanes that still have a shot to win or are winning..\n\nDon't follow the meta bull, the Yi is not a viable jungler, nor are any of the guinsoo's builds. Unless your team has a tanky top and support it's a horrible idea to mess the composition up even more.  Half the people who play like this think they're untouchable and make the dumbest plays ever.","replies":[]}]}
