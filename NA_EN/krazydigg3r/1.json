They played 3 games, 2 of which were ranked.\r\nhttp://imgur.com/a/7oxZx (the 2 morde games and the rek sai leave) \r\nI often look at my match history, and I know I never use mordekaiser ranked, and I don't own Rek'sai\r\nSo even if I forgot playing those games it was just not me\r\nI decided to check all of my account to see if he/she did any other things...\r\nI notice I have 50 RP instead of 55...\r\nSo look at my purchase history...\r\nhttp://imgur.com/a/%%%2T\r\nInstantly I notice all the changes:\r\nMad Scientist Ziggs was bought then refunded on the same day without it ever being used (I was on my account on the 15th)\r\nRek'sai was gotten from crafting (didn't cost a thing, not refundable, my 3 only champion shards gone)\r\nProject Katarina was refunded (the only money I spent on league)\r\nI have 1 refund instead of 3\r\nSo then I wondered why I only had 50 rp...\r\nI look at my gifting history...\r\nhttp://imgur.com/a/FKCbH\r\nI have never ever gifted someone ever before...\r\nNow my account has gifted 2 skins to a person not even on my friends list on the 14th...\r\nSo pretty much in short form, my account got broken into and got robbed.\r\nI changed my password on the 15th, but the damage was done.\r\nAfter changing my password, my account went undisturbed. So I guess you could say my account got logged into.\r\n\r\nSo Riot...\r\nAll I'm asking for is to have my project Katarina skin back...\r\nThank you for reading...\r\n\r\n(I'm sorry I love using ...)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-17T03:46:00.009+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your account has been compromised, our specialists would be more than happy to help!

The first one I sent I believed had an incorrect title. I saw after on the recovering FAQ that the title should have a correct name that's why you can see why I have 2 different titles and why there's a 20 minute interval in between.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tupaco","date":"2017-03-17T04:30:31.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man keep us updated on if this is resolved","replies":[{"poster":"Krazydigg3r","date":"2017-03-18T02:32:50.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tupaco,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=mEQwhonY,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-03-17T04:30:31.784+0000)\n>\n> Hey man keep us updated on if this is resolved\n\nUpdate:\n\nWithin 2 hours of sending in my ticket, I got my skin back and refunds restored!!!\nRiot has the hands down best player service!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Krazydigg3r","date":"2017-03-17T14:38:46.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tupaco,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=mEQwhonY,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-03-17T04:30:31.784+0000)\n>\n> Hey man keep us updated on if this is resolved\n\nwill do","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Krazydigg3r","date":"2017-03-17T02:08:51.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://imgur.com/a/J1uEZ\n\nmy purchase history without the %%%","replies":[]}]}
