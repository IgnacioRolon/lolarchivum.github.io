False ban","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not one to usually complain but I just received a 14 day suspension for feeding intentionally which was not the case (1 game). I was playing a norm around 15 games ago with a toxic team and everyone knew it was a loss from the beginning. I died 22 times, had 5 kills and 10 assists, and I just couldn't wait for the game to be over, it was a bad match for sure. I died a bunch but I was trying throughout the match regardless of what the other mates we're saying and how hard I was getting camped. I have been killing it in ranked lately and I was just about to finish promos until that ban just popped out of nowhere. I was obviously reported by the 3 people I was playing with and I want to know if there is anyway I could revoke this ban with riot because it is utterly false and absurd that this just happened because of one horrific match. I consider myself a serious player and I'm striving towards being a professional player. I am not one to feed or troll and I intend to be sportsmanlike all around and my match history shows that. I believe this to be a false ban. I have already sent a ticket but the wait is long, If anyone can help me out with this I'd appreciate it. \n\nI'd appreciate serious answers, I understand the rules to this game and that 99% of bans are rightfully accused but this one is a no no. I just purchased RP and planned on playing hard tonight with my friends and this happened.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-30T21:14:23.952+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want more context as to why this ban was placed, you're welcome to reach out to our player behavior team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) where they can go over what was said in the match that got you banned.
