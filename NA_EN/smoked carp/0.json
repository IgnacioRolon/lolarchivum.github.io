The problem is that other runes in Dominion are tailored to assassins/skirmishers and don&#039;t fit mages at all. Sorcery has great runes but secondary path only allow 2 runes to be selected. \r\n\r\nAnother problem is choosing between Sorcery and Inspiration. Stopwatch and Cosmic Insight fit mages super well, while Ultimate Hat and Transcendence give mages with game changing ultimates (e.g. Orianna) much more power. Sorcery as a primary rune is fine but Arcane Comet just wouldn&#039;t land on a champ like Velkoz with no reliable CC. Early game Arcane Comet damage is also almost negligible. It would be very nice if Electrocute is a Sorcery keystone. That way mages can work with Sorcery + Inspiration.\r\n\r\nI feel like mages get the least out of the new runes system. ADC has higher attack speed and deals much more dmg with the new runes; Support have shields and heals that are broken; Tanks are tankier than ever and with health and Armor/MR runes ; and assassins get more vision control and more burst. Meanwhile mages get to choose between Sorcery, Dominion, and Inspiration, and Dominion doesn&#039;t even fit mages well.{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Stevev45","date":"2017-11-08T21:57:17.695+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ultimate Hat  combines multiplicity with other cool-down reduction.

Thanks to grasp's HP gain and the other HP-gain thing in their tree, they can build things like frozen heart and stoneplate and become impossible to kill (mundo possibly being the biggest beneficiary of said rune changes). Mages are kinda weird right now, to the point in which I might actively see a lot of them take kleptomancy just to try and get better value out of trades in lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Smoked Carp","date":"2017-11-08T22:10:53.201+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"lol kleptomancy is fun...","replies":[{"poster":"Miror B","date":"2017-11-08T22:23:54.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering the one game I tried it I had 1900 gold at 4mins on a sona, I agree.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2017-11-09T22:48:13.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thought every rpg protagonist ever XD","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Smoked Carp","date":"2017-11-08T22:01:51.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yea, I just looked through some other posts and apparently tanks are not happy..Guess I'll go play ADC{{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2017-11-08T22:07:39.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I was thinking that press the attack might work on a burst mage, if you can get the 3 AAs in.","replies":[{"poster":"Smoked Carp","date":"2017-11-08T22:12:43.115+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"but other Precision runes suck for mages","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2017-11-08T22:36:13.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Takedown and Coup De Grace would both work on a mage and the one that gives you AS helps last hitting with AAs and synergizes with your keystone.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jmman","date":"2017-11-14T18:39:47.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Mages really need a spell one that after 3 magic source damage.  that way dot and sustain mages had something.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Slythrin Umbreon","date":"2017-11-08T22:06:00.007+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Electrocute might be a little overtoned, but people really are underselling Comet.

The meteor is like a electro if you have a heavy damage and hard CC Mage but if you have a little more damage and shields get the pet rune that little fucker is great on mages like Ori, Lulu, Lux, Karma (the list is longer) that have both Heavy DMG and Bulky Shields. Dont always think this game is about getting kills and DMG its also about gold, items, HP and MP management and teamwork and I see that Riot wants to make this more of a farming season because honestly LCS went by super fast compared to others they use to have. But before people say thinks like about the rune that lets you get free gold and lets you go into debit.....well the way I see it thoses are champs like Ez and Draven or any champ that has a HUGE curve until they hit the \"OMGWTF this dude just got penta point\" but thats just my in take on it so please take it with a gain of salt everyone has a right to speak their thought so let them do it. STOP BEING A BABY AND GROW TRY SOMETHING NEW. If you dont try new things you will never enjoy them like when QT played EZ klepto and and said it was garbage at 1st then had legit fun with it\n\nLike the Ads for Riot say have fun being a noob grow and have fun because every fuck up is a learning step{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Friendly Ram","date":"2017-11-14T18:59:38.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I dunno i like Aery for mages as she has such a low cooldown.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tukan Tonko","date":"2017-11-10T11:51:33.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I find new runes pretty good for mages. I usually used stormraider's for bursty mage and I was really sad that I couldn't I couldn't use it on less bursty mages and mages with less reliablebursts. Now I can. I just played with Ahri with that new stormraiders and it was pure epicness. I even found myself doing weird stuff I nevrr did before, so it enhanced my gameplay perfectly. You got a lot of options and it doesn't always depend which keystone does more damage - oh, electrocute does  more damage than comet, so it's better. No, comet is as good as electrocute because it has lower CD, it is AoE and most importantly, it can screw enemies. People try to dodge the comet even if it deals small amount of damge. Not only do I have more time but they often break the combo chain so they do less damage as well.  \nAerie is another option that greatly enhances ones gameplay. Karma is a great example of this, you can use both damage and shielding. \nKleptomancy is another great option, it doesn't give you damage but instead it can give you gamebreaking moments that can decide if you lose or win the fight. It also greatly affects laning. \nIt depends on how you want to play the game. I prefer utility over raw damage almost in all scenarios. It is, however my playstyle and I know you may not agree with me. But I gave you some suggestions you could try. Really, kleptomancy is a fun keystone you can try to start early snowball and try to get ahead.","replies":[]}]}
