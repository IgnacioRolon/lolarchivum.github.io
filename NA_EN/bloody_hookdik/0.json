Client keeps crashing after champion select instead of loading into the game. I have been cooperating with Riot support since it started. So far I've reinstalled the game (5+ times now), graphics cards, performed forced patches with the Hextech Repair Tool, downloaded Malwarebytes as recommended by support and performed multiple scans...and it works for a day or two and crashes again. \r\n\r\nWhy is this a thing? Can't Leaverbuster's automatic punishments be amended to exclude players who never even load into the game? Are there really that many people who AFK from the start that aren't having technical issues? I'm a huge fan of the game and play with a large group of friends, but I'm a crash or two away from never playing this game again. \r\n\r\nTechnical issues are a headache, but it's the forced 20 minute wait to even queue for 5-10 games as punishment for those issues that make me not want to continue playing.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-22T17:38:24.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Leaverbuster treats everyone equally regardless of intent, because all leaves still causes negative experiences for other players.  It's good that you've been in touch with the tech team, keep up with that to get whatever is causing you to crash resolved.  In the meantime, sticking to custom games might help to prevent anymore penalties.  Good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Bloody HookDik","date":"2016-12-23T05:16:34.806+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The \"causes negative experiences for other players\" explanation is not sufficient. I'm already dealing with technical issues from the client - no other games have an issue on my cpu - and then get hit with 20 extra minutes to get into future games. Who's having a more negative experience than that? The others in the game who can remake after 3 minutes, while I spend hours reinstalling and waiting through a \"punishment\" queue?\n\nI understand how Leaverbuster works; it's too simple of a solution. In this case, it's making an annoying problem turn into an unbearable one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iceclawz","date":"2017-02-11T19:09:14.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also have a problem with bug splat and i have a great PC i never left a game  even for 1 sec and am not going to i never flamed my teammates but i get alot of leaverbuster bcz of splatbugs its getting really annyoying i stoped league today bcz of this so much stress i wish i never played this game and wasted money on it .","replies":[]}]}]}
