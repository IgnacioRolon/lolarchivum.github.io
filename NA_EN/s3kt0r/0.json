I have to shut down the entire thing and resign in just to make it work and in most cases I am 2 minutes late going in making the entire affair just plain unpleasant.  Last game it happened to our team's mid laner (managed to come back a minute before game over) and that forced us to just give up playing the game.","replies":[{"poster":"BoiseBossBear","date":"2014-12-13T04:59:30.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, this has been happening to me every game after the new patch. I fail to connect to the game, and I end up having to restart everything just to enter the game. I usually get back within the first five minutes, but it really affects the game.
