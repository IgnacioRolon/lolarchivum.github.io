They're more or less an interpretation of death as a stand alone, comes with a mask + lamb/wolf symbolism as a stand alone.

The last skin she had was . . . that weird robo theme skin beyond her default.  She's definitely doable for one and I'm pretty sure the Kindred Reddit is hyping for a skin of this nature as well?

Coven Camille's whole aesthetic would better gel as a servant to Ornn, not to mention that both are tanks (well Camille is technically an off-tank, but she still fits the sturdier design). Lissandra's deer god is probably something much more graceful like her; perhaps the future champion could be an assassin fighter in the vein of Diana or Riven, or even a mage like Lissandra herself.
