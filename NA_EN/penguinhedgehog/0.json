Hosting the PBE files and the main League of Legends files in the same directory has been reported to cause problems.\n* Double click on \"lol.launcher.exe\" or \"lol.launcher.admin.exe\" to run the launcher and start patching.\n\nDid you happen to accidentally install it in your main League of Legends directory? Or did you perhaps launch the live client.\n\nIf this all went successfully, you'll be able to launch the PBE client. It looks super similar to the live client, so take a look in the upper left hand corner, and you should see it say \"PBE\" as opposed to \"North America\" or another region. \n\nIn regards to not being able to log in to the PBE boards, is it possible the PBE was down for maintenance? Sometimes, the boards become unavailable during that time. Also, double check that you're using your PBE username/password, as opposed to the login information you'd use on your live account. \n\nIf you're still having issues after checking out the info above, please submit a [Player Support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=4584) and we'll be able to troubleshoot with you a bit more to get you set up for the PBE!","replies":[{"poster":"penguinhedgehog","date":"2015-06-12T03:27:38.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bakru, I've already extracted the file whenever the file whenever I downloaded the PBE windows client, but thanks anyways.\n\n\nRiot KateyKhaos, It keeps taking me to regular LoL client. I honestly don't know why it keeps doing that, whether there is something that I'm missing with my computer, or there is something else that I am completely overlooking. (I do that a lot) As to the boards problem, this keeps coming up _\"You must first create a Summoner by logging into League of Legends before logging into our website.\"_ \n\nAnyways, I'll keep looking into it and I'll let you all know as soon as I figure out what is happening. Thanks for the help though. I'll put in a ticket for now, but I have a feeling that my computer might be part of the problem.\n(I'll keep at this until I get to Pool Party Zac, so that's going to be a lonoooong time.
