The page you were looking for doesn't exist. You may have mistyped the address or the page may have moved. Take me back to the home page.  :(\r\n\r\nSo I am asking, did Riot get my ticket or is somewhere lost? I send them second ticket (I know, it's stupid thing to do but I wanted to try it) and it says the same thing. :/\r\n\r\nI hope you can help me. Thanks :)\r\n\r\nBTW: English isn't my main language so when there are some mistakes or something doesn't make sense, I'm sorry. :D","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-01T20:27:59.565+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I checked and I can see your ticket, and it appears you've been working with a specialist already.

I am waiting since from 4 days. They suspended to my account for protection but this is like punishment... But there is no crime... Just i coundn't see my old materials in my inventory and i thought someone reached to my account or i can't remember my inventory (cause i didn't play maybe since from 4 weaks) i banned later from sent ticket... just i said them; control to my account please . (if someone reached) But i thing they read it like ''ban me.''  Really there is no help. If they won't write me no more, i will create a new discussion. No more writing? I will create one more and more. I wrote under your reply for now. I hope you will write me a reply and give me time about my account's open date. If this problem is not in your department please say to my ticket to other support GM and show this message. -.-","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-23T22:18:34.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What the support agent was asking you to do was to visit [this page](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us), sign out of your League account (top right), then submit a **new ticket** using [*this form*](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416).\n\nI hope this helps.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MultiBeard","date":"2018-01-02T15:13:46.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem please please help! http://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/33209035","replies":[]},{"poster":"EXKON","date":"2016-10-21T08:05:31.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem .... \nhttp://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/23815868","replies":[]},{"poster":"Loneax","date":"2017-01-12T13:50:09.921+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same issues aswell @Targons blade http://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/25069911","replies":[]}]}
