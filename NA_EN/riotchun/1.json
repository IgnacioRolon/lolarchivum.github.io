{"poster":"RiotChun","date":"2014-05-24T01:56:29.784+0000","title":"[4.9] Live Gameplay Patch Forecast","subforum":"Live Gameplay Balance","up_votes":17,"down_votes":11,"body":"Hi guys, here is Chun with 4.9 Patch Forecast, where I'll be talking about the major issues we're looking at in League of Legends. Keep in mind that the forecast is more about identifying problems that we're looking at, and not promises of changes to come in each patch. Some changes might take longer than others!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1) Kha'Zix\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs Jag mentioned in last forecast (http://community.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/live-gameplay/gTkfbmI6-48-live-gameplay-patch-forecast), we have been working on Kha’Zix. Currently Kha’Zix is being played and built like a brute-force fighter who can initiate a team fight while also being able to survive to clean it up. Assassins in League need to rely on fighters or tanks to initiate fights before they take the opportunity to engage, but Kha'Zix is able to do it all by himself, which gives him a lot of free power. We're looking at highlighting Kha'Zix's assassin powers over his fighter abilities.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs a side goal, some of Kha'Zix's evolutions are really powerful and certain ones are really weak (hello W), so we want to make all 4 of his evolutions compete with each other (maybe not equally, but situationally), so you can choose the evolution to adapt what you need it in certain phases of games.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2) Kassadin\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs a rework follow up, we've been keeping track of Kassadin as he continues to become a more and more dominant force. We think we released Kassadin in a good state but then gave him a little too much strength as we saw players struggling with the new kit. The buffs taught players how to play the updated Kass, so we're peeling back the layers we added to get him back to a correct power level.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3) Kayle\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKayle right now is being played as an AP-scaling supportive mobile ADC because of her consistent burst, her high ramping damage and her high utility. What this also does is give her very few weaknesses as she can shred everyone in the fight while staying just out of range to use her Intervention on a teammate. We're looking at ways to give Kayle some real weaknesses to compensate for her high strengths so she needs to think about how she gets into the fray.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4) LeBlanc\r\n \r\nAs mentioned in 4.7 forecast, we're continuing to look into LeBlanc. Some of the things we like about LeBlanc are her high precision, her skill requirements, and her trickiness. Unfortunately she's doing all of this along with having crazy high burst damage without any counterplay for the enemy. LeBlanc has so much damage that in competitive play she doesn’t even need a Deathfire Grasp to burst down enemies (and DFG is potentially overboard at doing this). This tells us that LeBlanc is scaling very well (too well?) as a burst champion, and we're trying to find a way to balance her tricky / precise burst while making her fair to play against.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n5) Braum\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs a follow -up to a newly released champion, Braum is a little too powerful at this point. We are happy with what he can do for his team in team fights as a shield man, but meanwhile he is getting very tanky too quickly and he's a strong lane bully at same time. When we release champions we have to think about how players will get used to their playstyle, but people were mastering Braum very quickly so we're keeping an eye on his performance across all levels of play.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n6) Pantheon\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGrand Skyfall was always intended to be a high risk, high reward - a high damage global ability that's inconsistent. We've never been a fan of Pantheon's ability to cast spells while landing (which made his ult very reliable), but as he's gotten more into the spotlight, we finally decided to make the fix (and then forgot to document it, which was a big mistake). Either way, we've fixed the bug with Pantheon's ult where he could be affected by AoE abilities before he lands, but we're still trying to find a good way to make Grand Skyfall feel good to use without directly buffing its power levels (Pantheon has actually been pretty stable from some of our internal statistics). \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n7) Jungle XP\r\n\r\n \r\nWe have bigger plans for the jungle, but currently we're seeing problems where junglers are getting really far ahead of the game, especially if they have a strong start. We think it might have to do with lane EXP versus monster EXP, as lane minion EXP doesn't scale with average champion level, but jungle monster EXP does. Basically a snowballing jungler gets his teammates some kills, they get levels and bring up the average level of the game, and then the jungler gets even more experience as he clears camps for additional rewards. No other lanes get this kind of bonus, and we've always been aware of strong junglers controlling the pace of the game, so we're looking for ways to tone that down.","replies":[{"poster":"Cronovey","date":"2014-05-24T03:15:53.727+0000","up_votes":62,"down_votes":6,"body":"> 7) Jungle XP\n> \n>  \n> We have bigger plans for the jungle, but currently we're seeing problems where junglers are getting really far ahead of the game, especially if they have a strong start.

No other lanes get this kind of bonus, and we've always been aware of strong junglers controlling the pace of the game, so we're looking for ways to tone that down.\n\nI'm very, very concerned about this change to be honest. While I understand that some junglers with strong ganks and fast clear times (Xin Zhao, Udyr, and Nocturne especially) are able to get some pretty solid level advantages, I'm very worried that this will be yet another nerf to the tank junglers who are already outside the current meta. Nautilus, Maokai, Malphite, and even Shen were all potent and powerful jungle picks at different points throughout previous seasons, but with the implementation of the Spirit Stone changes and the addition of Feral Flare, they are all but unplayable right now due to the speed which fighter and bruiser junglers can clear the jungle and still have time to gank, all while being much more sustained due to their higher damage output.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is the current \"Madstone\" build going around where a jungler builds a Madred's Razors and Spirit Stone simultaneously for infinite sustain and incredible clear time in the jungle, which snowballs into absolutely massive advantages, especially over players who don't know of the tactic right now. I would suggest that one way to slow these oppressive junglers would be restricting the jungle items not as a GP10 item as they currently are, but by limiting junglers to only having one item built with a Hunter's Machete. The ability for a jungle tank to pick up something like a Talisman would be incredibly powerful for them and possibly allow champions like Nautilus, Skarner, and the like to see play time that they haven't seen since the GP10 changes and the removal of their ability to purchase Shurelia's Reverie, now Talisman. Some jungle tanks could also make great use of things like Face of the Mountain, with Relic Shield being a nice item for junglers to tax lanes after ganking them and so on. These items would be all but worthless to the current powerhouse junglers while allowing tank junglers back into the meta with the utility items they need to really bring the heat in team fights and ganks.","replies":[{"poster":"SmashGizmo","date":"2014-05-24T06:01:57.468+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":49,"body":"I get your concern here and just wanted to offer up a couple responses.\n\nThe first is that while it's true that this will also be a slight nerf to jungle support tanks, the relative nerf is much lighter on them than it is on fighter/assassin junglers.  Basically, this XP scaling ramped up as the game ramped up, meaning that it has a very minimal impact on the first 6 levels of the game and was mostly impacting the XP from camps in the mid to late game.  During these later phases of the game, not only are Tanks slower at dedicated jungle farming, but they're also spending more time ganking, assisting lanes, and donating camps to teammates than their damage dealing counterparts.  So all in all, yes, their strength is slightly lower from this change than it was prior to this change, but they lost much less than the class that they are trying to compete with and thus get relatively stronger (slightly).\n\nThe second response I'll offer up is that we're still working on larger jungle projects aimed more directly at bringing Tank junglers back up to par with Fighters/Assassins.  The change for XP in this patch is merely a response to a problematic trend we're seeing, it's not nearly large enough scale to be aimed at solving the larger issues that are causing Tanks to suffer in the Season 4 jungle.  As I said above, I believe the net result of this change is a small relative benefit for Tank junglers, but this change is not aimed at the problem you're stating and rather, we have a larger on-going project that is working towards the issues you're seeing.","replies":[{"poster":"TheKoiNamiCode","date":"2014-05-24T06:54:25.872+0000","up_votes":53,"down_votes":4,"body":"I'm just confused as to what you guys actually *want* junglers to do. I've seen, \"We want junglers to be able to carry,\" \"We want them to bring utility,\" etc. But all we keep getting are nerfs to each aspect until we, more than likely,  get back to how it was before with junglers being basically a second support. I'm confused to how carry junglers are problematic especially if they contribute well to their team throughout the game. In the end, if the enemy jungler is ahead shouldn't it fall back to the people in lane to ward and remember to play safe and give that as a reminder,giving that it should be being done anyways, as opposed to nerfing an entire archetype/playstyle?","replies":[{"poster":"SOGENT","date":"2014-05-24T11:31:47.462+0000","up_votes":47,"down_votes":1,"body":"Have to agree here.\n\nI've been a jungler 90% of games since Season 2.  You guys don't seem to have a clear idea of exactly what you want the jungler to do and, as a player, it's getting quite frustrating to see this constant flip-flopping.  Since S2, the support jungler meta, you've worked to increase gold and allow certain junglers to have a more prominent role on the team.  In Season 3, one of the stated goals was to allow carry junglers to be viable and that came with mixed results.  In Season 4, you've achieved that goal.  The jungle role seems more popular than it ever has been and it's been (from my experience) the most fun.  However, now it seems you have a problem with junglers being able to carry.  From the outside, it looks like this:\n\n**S3 Riot:**  We want carry junglers to be able to carry and the role to have higher impact to allow players to live the end game fantasy.\n\n*Junglers can carry and/or have high impact.*\n\n**S3 Riot:**  Junglers are able to somewhat carry and have high impact, we need to tune that back by nerfing a lot of the top tier junglers who do this.\n\n*The highest impact junglers are nerfed.*\n\n**S4 Riot:** We didn't quite achieve what we wanted with carry junglers.  We want carry junglers to be able to carry.\n\n*Carry junglers become carries.*\n\n**S4 Riot:**  Carry junglers are able to carry.  We'll be nerfing several jungler champs who can carry.\n\n*Carry junglers/items are nerfed.*\n\n**S4 Riot (Current):**  Carry junglers are still able to carry.  We'll be toning back XP so carry junglers cannot carry as well.\n\nThis is getting very old.  I think a large number of players would like to see you spend even half this time and effort of going back and forth on improving tank junglers (buffing, not nerfing everything else until they are good) which seem to have barely been touched the entire season.  I feel that Riot creates a lot of extra work for itself that isn't necessary by making changes, being successful, undoing those changes because they are successful, etc, rather than actually making efficient progress.\n\nThe jungle meta is tied together.  Carry and Tank/Support junglers are not independent of one another.  You cannot get one \"right\" before moving to the other and expect the changes not to affect each other.  You either need to know exactly what to do to both to create some balance in the two (which you're clearly playing it by ear now) or you need to work on them both at once so that you can see what adjusting one does to the other and vise versa.  If you do carries now, you'll have to go back and make changes when you work on tanks (and likely undo some of the work you've done).  This is not very efficient.","replies":[{"poster":"Phreak","date":"2014-05-25T03:05:54.776+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":11,"body":"The goal has always been to have a mix. In the first few seasons, it was basically impossible to carry from the jungle because there wasn't any gold in it. We upped the gold, a little too much, and the junglers who carried became massively overpowered, so we have to tune it back down. We're happy that guys like Wukong and Kha'Zix can jungle now, but we want Nautilus to be able to be picked, too.\n\nAs an example, saying, \"Yeah, you know we'd really like Rumble to get played\" then giving him 5,000 damage on Flamespitter, nerfing it next patch, and players going, \"WTF I thought you wanted to buff Rumble, Riot!\" And the answer is yes we do, but we don't want it broken in the other direction.","replies":[{"poster":"Jesus is Savior","date":"2014-05-25T04:09:40.615+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":1,"body":"Here's a question that hasn't been asked yet: Why wasn't all this figured out in the preseason? It seems like EVERY. SINGLE. PATCH. as a jungle main, I have to practice like 20+ games in normals before I can go back to ranked. Implement Feral Flare? Gotta practice, even if I'm not a flare jungler, so I know what to expect (but, most of my junglers are flare junglers :P - still need to practice tho). Nerf Feral Flare? Gotta practice again for another 20+ games. And now, if the exp gets nerfed? Time to practice yet again, so I know what to expect. You guys aren't just nerfing/changing champions. You're nerfing/changing the entire jungle every patch. If you nerf exp, I WILL have to practice, and it WILL be a big deal. The jungle isn't like a lane, where you can keep up with your opponent, regardless of changes. The jungle is you vs the world, and you need to know your power relative to EVERY lane (will I hit level X before mid hits level Y? when can I gank and be successful and not die?), as well as EVERY objective (when will I hit level X and be able to take dragon? And what level are the enemies going to be, and how likely will they be able to stop me?).\n\nThe jungle this season is a lane that could single handedly drop my rank because of a \"small\" patch if I decided to spam ranked without practicing in normals after every patch. And that's kinda sad, because that's supposed to be what the preseason is for.\n\nI actually hope that you nerf junglers out of viability for another patch  by overdoing this exp nerf (just like you did in the preseason with the dual targons top lane meta - which was fine, it was PRESEASON), just so I can point back to this post and say \"I told you so - you guys suck, get your shit together\". And hey, laning is about last-hitting, so maybe it'll be a fighter + full-tank (eg: Nautilus) going top, and you'll get your wish: Nautilus will be picked again! At the expense of...

Us included.\n\nWhile I understand it's a very complex game, there's a big difference between champions being perceived as strong/weak picks and an entire role being shifted in almost every patch of the season. Since the pre-season patch 3.14:\n\nIn 3.14 trinkets were added to the game as well as vision changes. Jungle items were massively changed, mostly nerfed. Ancient Golem's health was reduced, Elder Lizard no longer procs from magic damage abilities and had its AD nerfed, and Spectral Wraith saw some buffs. Smite got a massive cooldown/damage change. Jungle items are now considered GP10 items, restricting junglers from accessing Shurelya's Reverie, now Talisman, so tank/support junglers nerfed heavily.\n\nIn 3.15 Spectral Wraith and Elder Lizard had their bounty passives removed and replaced with Conservation.\n\nIn 4.1 Spirit Stone was changed which massively inflated it's value on DPS junglers, so tank jungles were massively weakened.\n\nIn 4.3 Spirit Stone changed again to buff it for AoE junglers, which weakened some and buffed others.\n\nIn 4.4 Madred's and Wriggle's got changed.\n\nIn 4.5 we had the addition of Feral Flare.\n\nIn 4.6 we had the cost changes of Wriggle's and the Feral Flare stacking requirement increased to 30.\n\nIn 4.7 we had Wriggle's Maim damage nerfed and Feral Flare damage/healing nerfed as well as the attack speed on the item lowered.\n\nTo date this season since the pre-season, there have been 2 major patches that didn't heavily affect the jungle: 4.2 and 4.8 (most recent patch). 4.2 had the potential to wreak havoc on jungling with the Skarner rework and the defensive healing mastery nerf, but the champions who would actually use that type of mastery (Mundo, Zac, etc) aren't really strong junglers in the current game and the Skarner rework was a giant flop that left everyone shaking their heads and wondering what happened. 4.8 had very minimal changes overall, and was actually quite pleasant as far as patches go; some bug fixes, a nice indicator added for Udyr ala Yasuo style (which is beautiful, kudos to whoever added that) and other than that, not a lot to consider.\n\nThe jungle has been shifting constantly, and it has almost all been to the detriment of jungle tanks; vision changes (everyone having free wards available) made the tanks without instant gap-closers (Nautilus, Mundo, Cho'gath, Hecarim, etc) weaker while champions with strong gap closing abilities didn't feel a heavy difference (J4, Lee Sin, Xin Zhao, Evelynn's stealth). Spirit Stone changes further weakened them all. Feral Flare's addition was just another nail in the coffin for tank junglers in season 4.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Prometheus856","date":"2014-05-25T07:44:44.115+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's easy to answer, it's because when you alter one thing another can rise up to take it's place. That's what I tend to call your wack-a-mole balance at work. For example, let's look at midlane Lulu. Why did it take 4 months for midlane Lulu to catch on? This is assuming that you're looking at Lulu from patch 3.14 to patch 4.5, which is the last time she was touched. Let's review:\n\n\n-Patch 3.14. Lulu is buffed.\n\n-Patch 3.15. Lulu is buffed again.\n\n-Patch 4.2. Kayle nerfed, sort of. Yasuo nerfed... sort of. Ziggs nerfed.\n\n-Patch 4.3. Gragas nerfed. Kassadin nerfed. Yasuo nerfed again, sort of.\n\n-Patch 4.4. Kassadin nerfed/redone/whatever. Annie nerfed. Lich Bane champions squashed like a bug.\n\n-Patch 4.5. Lulu nerfed.\n\n\nWhy wasn't Lulu played when she was first buffed? That's easy to answer, because Ziggs, Kassadin, Yasuo, Gragas, and Fizz/Kayle/Other Lich Bane champions owned midlane. There simply wasn't a way for her to show her stuff. But once ALL her competition got nerfed, she became good by comparison.\n\n\nYou can't seriously tell me you don't know that this is how things work, because to be honest, I'd have trouble believing you. I arrived at these conclusions with 20 minutes of thought and have yet to see a contradiction to them - if you nerf the competition, the new \"best\" that was kept in check behind it reappears.

Wriggles gives a tank scaling damage to camps even if they don't build any other damage items, and spirit stone gives them the sustain they need to clear the camps, since they won't be building lifesteal (and warmogs/health regen is a joke outside of super-long sieges - those are lane sustain items, where you can hide behind minons, NOT jungle sustain items)\n\nMadstone also has disadvantages - if you're behind and forced into a fight, you will die, because you wasted an extra 700 gold on a spirit stone, on top of your Wriggles, which gives you zero combat stats.\n\nLast point: let's not forget that madstone was a thing (albeit, not very popular) before Feral Flare even existed. I'd rather they not ruin this strategy.","replies":[{"poster":"Get Swoll Son","date":"2014-05-24T03:40:20.251+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are then insanely weak PvP.","replies":[{"poster":"Jesus is Savior","date":"2014-05-24T03:47:20.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, and so are the fighters/bruisers/carries who do the madstone build.

Tanks usually at least have some good cc to disengage, and some tanky base stats to let them do well in ganks if they have competent teammates.\n\nThe big difference here is that the fighters/bruisers/carries almost all benefit in some way from increased attack speed (faster Three Talon Strike for Xin for CC and more healing procs, more Phoenix procs or faster lifesteal in Turtle for Udyr, more true damage with Wuju Style and passive procs, not to mention faster Alpha Strike cooldowns, on Yi, and more passive procs for Nocturne) while the majority of jungle tanks don't see any benefit from an attack speed item (Rammus gets...AA damage, Zac gets...AA damage, Maokai gets...AA damage). You can see where this actually just makes the issue even worse; that 700g deficit just to clear the jungle efficiently while other junglers could choose not to do this actually puts them at a bigger disadvantage. Allowing them access to the utility items they currently cannot buy because they chose to build their jungle item brings relevance to them where someone like Master Yi or Xin Zhao wouldn't care because who needs a Talisman on Xin, or a Face of the Mountain on Yi?\n\nIn addition to this, these DPS junglers have a faster clear time and higher overall damage, which allows them to farm the required 1150g after Machete/pots start to get the combo while tank junglers are going to be days behind them in obtaining this because of their much slower clear time. So yes, the items are also available to tanks. This does not mean that the combo is even remotely equal between the two sets of champions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Braggleshnorf","date":"2014-05-24T08:28:36.279+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":8,"body":"\"Hurr durr. How do we fix Kha'zix? He's so problematic. He's being played and built like a brute-force fighter who can initiate a team fight while also being able to survive to clean it up. We can't find out what the problem is though!!!\" \n\nThis is the kind of stuff that makes people question you balance team. He isn't being build any more tanky than any other fighter/bruiser. Look: http://www.probuilds.net/champions/Kha'zix \n\nHow do you not realize the problem? How do you not understand the power of a flat 50% damage mitigation? Honestly. People only started evolving his ult and playing him more as a distraction initiator when you buffed his ult in 3.08, and then continued to increase the time in which he was stealth, and nerfed his other evolutions. How do you not understand how strong his ult evolution is? Do you know what that is? Do you know what you gave a god damn dps assassin??? You gave him an Alistar ult, mixed with a Twitch Q. Do you know how stupid that is? It's not a weaker version or something. It's just as strong as those abilities. 50% damage reduction, stealth, movespeed. \n\nOther champs (they're called tanks btw), spend the entire game trying to achieve that amount of tankiness. Their runes. Their masteries. Their entire item builds. Some barely even get more tanky than that. \"Oh but they're tanky all the time so it's ok.\" NO. It doesn't make any difference. He's tanky when he needs it. He can activate it as abilities are getting thrown at him. And you give this to a champ with one of the highest single target burst AND sustained damages in the game (from level 1 all the way to level 18). \n\nI would rather have the old W evolve Manamune poke-until-you-one-shot-everything Kha'zix than this new bullshit tank dps assassin. I understand that you changed him back then because you \"want champs to more accurately fit their archetypes\" and all that bullshit. But you can't say you have that philosophy, and then GIVE A DPS ASSASSIN 50% DAMAGE REDUCTION. Hell, while we're at it, let's give Leblanc 50% damage reduction too. When she clones maybe? Ah who gives a shit she'll be 90% ban rate anyways. \n\nNot only is this a bullshit contradiction of philosophy, there isn't even \"counterplay\" to it. It's not \"Kha'zix gets 50% damage reduction against the first ability/attack that hits him\" or something. It's \"Press this R button here when shit starts getting thrown at you and you won't take damage\". Do you know how fucking stupid it is when you throw down a pink ward, your whole team throws everything down they have at Kha'zix, and he still walks away with a few hundred health after murdering or near murdering your adc? Why the hell would you give tank stats to Kha'zix? Honestly? Not only does % damage reduction effectively give him twice the health, it makes shields twice as effective. As well as heals, regen, reduces their lifesteal/vamp, etc.. Do you still not understand the power of 50% damage reduction? \n\nPardon my fucking french, but what the fuck? Who commands all of this?

Or if the balance team simply doesn't have enough resources. Or if the team is full of perfectionists who's egos have reached a new standard over the years that brings them too much shame to bring their older amateur work into viability - and on the same note, are too proud to nerf things that they are proud of and/or invested in.

If this is what they're going to to do to his kit fine but give him the Annie treatment then. If people prefer to play him as a tank archetype retune him to reflect that as Annie was when she came into prominence as a support. \n\nTo me it appears as if the \"balance\" changes are constantly just taking paths or least resistance. Instead of buffing what is too weak for the meta we get thrown into a constant series of unneeded nerfs and reworks. Players want specific things in a champion. Look at Gragas, sure he was very strong but he worked and worked well. He wasn't anti-fun like Kassadin or AP Yi, he was bursty and he was used because that's what people wanted. Gragas became such a prominent pick because of nerfs to Fizz, Ahri and Zed. LeBlanc became more and more popular because of the nerfs to Gragas. I realize the rise of damage junglers was due to a buff to them however it was not balanced with consideration of tank junglers therefore it lead to an immediate switch to what was strong. Pros and Players are going to play what's strongest because they are playing to win. If there's one clearly strong pick that's above all the others that's what is going to be played. The meta demands a burst assassin mid laner because they do everything the late game scalers like Karthus or Anivia can do but way earlier in the game. If that's the case who's going to play those late game scaling champions? If other styles of play were viable **at the same time on the same patch** then perhaps things could change but by buffing one thing and nerfing another on the same patch then you've really just put yourself in the same position as before.\n\nTop lane tanks came into prominence because of the destruction of viability of tank junglers. Why have a jungler that takes 40 minutes to get as tanky as a top laner who can be at that point at 20 minutes. As a Season 2 Jungler I may be biased towards tanks but I loved that meta. You could start boots, cloth armor, vamp scepter, red elixir basically anything you could make work (Jungle Karthus and Ahri S2 Main <3) . You had so many options and contrary to popular belief damage junglers did work then we just didn't have any or many (Nocturne Xin?)\n\nI feel like support and adc have the best balance of niche champions each able to fill a necessary role and each is viable. ADC preference changes depending on the meta. Lucian and Jinx are favorites because Towers are by far the most consistent source of income to the team. Ezreal Varus and Cait were prominent during the poke/seige meta. Twitch and Vayne work in a pick or split push meta. Kog'maw and Tristana were for the CLG Eu meta.\n\nTL;DR Patterns are simple. Nerfs aren't working. Small Buffs e.g. More base health for Maokai Naut Mumu etc. Consider rolling back previous nerfs e.g. Jarvan IV combo hitbox, Shen taunt hitbox.\n\n/rant","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hadriel","date":"2014-05-24T04:28:23.836+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":3,"body":"\"Kayle right now is being played as an AP-scaling supportive mobile ADC because of her consistent burst, her high ramping damage and her high utility.\"\n\nWhile I understand putting Kayle into words might be difficult, this description is a sensationalist exaggeration of Kayle's strengths. She is an AP scaling supportive autoattack based carry with burst mobility, with high ramping DPS and strong windows of utility. She is not a \"mobile ADC\" because, for one, she isn't an ADC, and her mobility isn't an instantaneous movement spell nor does she have high base movement speed. She is on the harder scale of midlaners to position with because she deals her damage at 525 range with only a high cd speed burst to aid her that also forces her into the choice of using for heal or repositioning purpose. This renders her rather *immobile* in the midlane ecosystem. Also, there is no such thing as \"consistent burst.\" A champ either has burst or DPS. Lich Bane is the culprit of something like \"consistent burst;\" address that if you have issues with it, but Kayle's kit offers nothing of the sort.\n\nOn the topic of her nerfs, I can't understand why you've decided to do so or take this approach. 525 is already low range for an autoattacker, what you propose is absurdly severe and doesn't address any problem she might pose. The percieved problem with Kayle isn't she can't be reached, that's preposterous. Under this scope, Caitlyn might as well be immortal.\n\nThe new build is problematic, but there are are far more elegant solutions for this issue than removing her from viability by giving her literally Urgot range. If she needs more risk, then do the thing every Kayle detractor has always rallied for: give her ultimate a higher cooldown. She has her ult ready for every teamfight and sometimes can afford to use it TWICE. If you nerf her ult CD you create windows in which to force fights because she has to fight at short range and always relies on having her ult to insure she will get autos off even if she dies. THIS addresses the problem you cite, \"having no weaknesses\" which is also an exaggeration. She is weak to CC, AS reduction, reengagements, target changes and assassination provided her ult is unavailable. Most of these solutions require team coordination, which is why she's a good solo queue champion.\n\nOn competitive, the newfound build seems to be overwhelming, but you need not to gut her to fix the issue: you can code e so it isn't considered ranged and inhibit Runaan's use, or make it so the secondary bolts don't apply her passive (only on primary target). If you don't want to address the item (you should, then see how she dissapears once more like the FotM she is), you can make e's splash damage unable to apply her passive. If this proves to be insufficient, you can try to nerf e's slash radius, making her even more position intensive, and her enemies better equipped for fighting against her (space out).\n\nMy point is please, don't exaggerate what Kayle can do, don't downplay what she can't, address the real issues and don't target her before she can find opposition naturally (Akali murders Kayle, a fact not widely known). Don't pretend a range nerf isn't the most severe an AA based champion can receive. Be GRADUAL in any changes you apply on her and gather data before going further if needed. This is a champion who received a 0.4 AP nerf on top of a 0.25 AP nerf on Lich Bane which was a linchpin item on her.\n\nHer ult is the issue, try a flat 120 second CD (huge nerf) and you'll see immediate changes.","replies":[{"poster":"gibe d pusi b0ss","date":"2014-05-24T07:42:22.611+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I too believe this is the best possible nerfs for kayle without rendering her useless.

Sure, she can get very ahead, and that can be scary. You *remember* the games LeBlanc got fed and oneshotted everyone on the enemy team. What about all the games where she got lots of kills, but was utterly unable to convert that into anything productive? What about all the games where LeBlanc plays awfully, and is effectively nonexistent after laning? From her abysmal win rate at all MMRs, I'm going to guess those games are a lot more common than the LeBonkers games.\n\nOutside of competitive play, she is not a problem. Sure, she's snowbally, and good at killing people who she has enough damage to kill. So is Akali. The one difference? Akali doesn't see competitive play. There's lots of champs like that, and LeBlanc is just the one who is doubly unfortunate: her skill ceiling is massive, so she's overpowering in competitive; and her skill floor is equally massive, so she's already terribly weak outside of competitive. LeBlanc is not OP in any way that affects *you*.\n\nRegardless, this is a poorly considered nerf. It's a direct strike to LeBlanc's core mechanical identity of burst mage. It's crippling her strengths, rather than emphasizing her weaknesses. If you want to destroy her for competitive, make it so that her W only damages champions. This wrecks her already dicey waveclear, and forces her to rely entirely on single target autoattacks and spells to kill creeps. Actually, do that, and she's probably more viable as support than as mid.\n\n\nTo summarize, the LeBlanc you see is not strong. The LeBlanc that needs nerfs — the LeBlanc these changes are supposed to bring in line — is the LeBlanc of Bjergson and Hai.

His pre-11 is still tremendously strong despite it not utilizing it's full potential, because it gives him tremendous mobility in the form of a free teleport (or 35 gold if you buy a mana pot for it...) and can turn the direction of a push into a complete 180. His post-11 suffers, but that's because Panth is an early game champ anyway. It's useful for ganking, for stopping inner tower pushes, or for initiating fights, especially if you ult in towards the back of the group, rather than the front. I find my primary purpose when ulting with Panth isn't to do damage with it, or to make use of the slow, it's to force the other team to either deal with the damage/slow and my team's follow up by running into the circle, screw up their positioning by pushing them into the sides of the lane, preventing an escape, or in the best possible scenario, pushing them into my team while I hit their back line.\n\nIt has it's utility. As far as I'm concerned, they should just play off of that and lower the mana cost and CDs, so it can be used for plays more often. Heck, get rid of the damage and give him defensive stats when he lands it instead. That is IF anything about it needs changed in the first place.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pada1","date":"2014-05-24T03:07:11.147+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"are you guys going to buff up early game dragon again back to Pre S4 values? that is the only way to stop the constant laneswaps","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zalfier","date":"2014-05-24T05:30:34.727+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"3) Kayle\n\nNerf her Ult cooldowns.
