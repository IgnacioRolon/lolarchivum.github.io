It was already hard enough convincing the owner to let us in with how Zyra ''dresses'', but he tought we where mocking him when she ordered every single meal that contained meat. Twice.\n\nWe barely avoided getting thrown out like thieves by having me pay up-front for everything. (I'm not sure i'll be able to pay the rent this month. She sure has a crazy appetite.) It was fairly humiliating to have all the patrons look at us the way they did, I can tell you that, so I was relieved when she FINALLY finished gulping on everything.\n\nAfterwards, we went to the cinema. She insisted on watching some two hours long, sappy romance movie. She fell asleep during the ads, so I had to suffer through the whole movie alone, and since I was absolutely unable to wake her up, I had to carry her outside at the end.\n\nAt this point there was still some sunlight, so I suggested to go for a walk in the park. She enthusiastically accepted. I thought this would be a nice occasion to finally get to be alone together, peacefully.\n\nBoy, was I wrong.\n\nTurns out, her friends where all over the place, and she'd stop to talk to every single flowers and trees of the park. Need I tell you that was extremely awkward, and not exactly what I was planning for? I managed to keep my cool, though, and not let my rage out, up until the point where she started to hit on the big oak and get all up in his business.\n\nPlant-women are all the same.
