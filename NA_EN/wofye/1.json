AP MF is a stellar example of this.  When facing MF, people expect her Q and AAs to hurt like a mother, not her E and ultimate.  What made AD Soraka fun was the fact that you had a huge leg up in terms of AA damage, but your DPS scaling was terrible, and building her AD meant no sustain.  After her rework, her AD build actually became more viable due to her Q's innate sustain, and allowed you to hilariously zone, bully, and AA your opponents to death.\n\nAs for support Soraka, because Soraka's peeling capabilities are lackluster compared to most supports, she made up for it by having some scary zoning and poking capabilities with beefy autoattacks and huge AOE.  Taking away the AA damage means less poke.

Soraka has a clear set of strengths and weaknesses, and all of them hinge on her allies: she's the best healer in the game, and can keep allies topped up even against heavy burst or sustained damage, but also puts herself at heavy risk and dies quickly to focus. Her weakness to hard engages is what makes her killable in teamfights, and what allows her to have the phenomenal healing and supporting power she has. Toning this power down just to make her a better solo lane pick makes little sense, just as it doesn't make much sense to make the game's most selfless champion a competent solo laner when most of her abilities are geared towards helping her team.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the only reason Soraka was (briefly) a viable solo laner is because of how abusive she was. Her old Q let her zone out the enemy laner practically for free, and her long-duration, point-and-click E silence gave her free and oppressive harass, particularly against casters. Focusing her didn't work well either, because she frequently built like a bruiser and could make herself super-tanky with the armor on her old W. She was viable in solo lane for all the wrong reasons, and that solo lane power ended up costing her a lot of her supporting strength, prior to her rework.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2014-12-21T15:25:05.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based on the number of fans she had top/mid before she became OP, I think riot should have kept her as a multirole champ and created a new primary healer that went full ret*rd in healing.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2014-12-21T15:37:35.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering Soraka was, and still is, the only champion in the game with two ally-oriented heals (and one of them's a global ult), I don't think it would have made sense for anyone else but her to be the game's best healer.

Riot tried to shoehorn a bit of clutch-saving power with her old Salvation passive (heal more on low-health targets) and the short-duration armor buff her heal gave, but in the end it still made her really passive as a support and muddied the counterplay against her (she's meant to be fragile and vulnerable on her own, but that wasn't always the case when she could heal and armor up on demand). Soraka's new W is what her old W should have been right from the start, and I'm happy for the massive power and gameplay it provides.\n\nI also feel Soraka's kit was always worked around her heal(s). Prior to her rework, her Q got an increasingly large amount of power shifted into her heal by reducing her W's cooldown upon damaging enemy champions, and she had less CC and alternate utility than other supports just because healing took up so much of her power budget. Her old Q also made very little sense, as it forced her to get up close to her enemies for extended periods of time as a (theoretically) squishy caster support. Looking at her kit now, it just looks like the kind of power Soraka should have been about from the very beginning, whereas her brief stint as a mid-range bruiser mage never really fit her, her theme or her gameplay.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2014-12-21T22:41:00.164+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think her old hit revolved around her E and her new one around her Q.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Stoic Hero","date":"2014-12-21T14:50:15.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember when Janna was a viable mid lane mage, but she has been nerfed to the point of a pigeonholed support as well.\n\nI am not a huge fan of Soraka's rework either.

Soraka can beat most of the supports that are not damage focused 1v1, since in a battle where both sides have low damage, the constant slow from Q + selfheal wins. (I am assuming that you put a few points in Q first, since i think thats most reasonable if you want to be usefull)\n\nYou can escape with Q+E (btw you should never throw away your E as single spell unless you absolutely have to or just want to stop a channeled spell always chain it with your Q or allied spells) and you then cast out of range Q's that your pursuers run into. There are very few champions that have enough mobility to catch up with that. Despite her slow base movement speed Soraka is actually very good at kiting.\n\nSo even the enemies with the highest damage would slowly die if you play correctly. Soraka doesn't have a lot of potential to chase down kills herself, but if she is getting chased she can deal quite a lot of damage while being relatively safe.\n\nAbout breaking the meta, there are some very easy match ups, especially melee assassins or more squishy melee fighters like Riven.\n But Sorakas main weaknesses are :\n\n* her lack of abilities to get cs under tower,\n* her low AD coupled with extremely slow traveling bananas make last hitting very hard \n\nYou can't consistently carry many games with a \"mage approach\", you often\n\n*  have to transition into some kind of support to be efficient and thats kinda tricky to be support while being assigned to a solo lane.\n\nIf you are constantly getting pushed in you would\n\n*  rely on your team to have any chance of breaking out and having a chance to make an impact.\n\nOther champions get tons of damage as the game progresses and become a lot more threating to you and you simply cannot face them anymore at some point. The heal over time from Q that was strong in laning phase just wont be enough anymore so you would end up ulting in an attempt to 1v1 somebody and that on its own is a waste and probably won't be enough either.\n\nI don't even care that Soraka isn't truly viable as support, I think it's totally OK that she is pure support. However many players don't know how to handle a solo lane Soraka, so you kinda have the surprise effect on your side should you play it.\n\nAt any rate you might be right that she is sub-optimal as solo laner but definitely not for the reasons you mentioned at first.\nYour options are winning early or becoming a strong support or both. ;D\nCarrying late game with Starcalls is unlikey to happen....very.\n\nSo long...","replies":[]},{"poster":"o Mim o","date":"2014-12-21T18:03:33.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Starcall can do a lot of damage if building AP, and will also slow the target if you land it to the center of your enemy.
