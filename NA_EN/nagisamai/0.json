I'm only good at support and every time it's taken I have to abandon and it's making me so frustrated I might just quit. It didn't use to be like this until several updates ago and now I'm having problems loading champ select and end game results.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-13T16:53:04.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you mean by behind everyone else?  Does your timer seem out of sync?  Or do you mean that you're not getting the roles you're selecting in queue?  Sorry for the confusion here, let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Nagisamai","date":"2017-06-14T02:17:14.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean that the loading time is super slow for the champ select screen to show up after accepting a game, so I can't type what role I want to play before others. And my loading screen for end game results takes like 2 mins to load.","replies":[]}]}]}
