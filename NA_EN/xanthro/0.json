I was disenchanting other skin shards to create enough orange essence to upgrade to permanent. I mistakenly disenchanted the skin rather than upgrading it. Is there any possible way to retrieve this please!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-26T16:45:23.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a bummer when I hear that a skin shard was accidentally disenchanted, especially if it's a unique one like Hextech Annie.  I can't make any guarantees for you because there are confirmation windows before proceeding with an action, but you can reach out to us in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).  We'll look into your specific issue with Project Fiora, but again I can't make a guarantee here.
