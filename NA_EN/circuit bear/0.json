I have gotten gold in 3v3s for Season 2 and 3 because I hated solo queue I finally decided to try to see how high I could get in ranked if I tried to solo queue for a few months and got to platinum rather easily then got bored. I have spent probably enough to be considered in the upper quartile of spenders. I don't stream, but I bring in a lot of friends to play and try to encourage friends to get into it. Most of the people I bring along are consumers as well. On top of that, I often give things to friends to help encourage them to play. My friends often bring their friends to play as well.\r\n\r\nSo I am not a free loader. I am not just some \"angry teen\" who is mad cause their main got nerfed. I have put up with my favorite characters been in the bottom tier for 2 seasons now.\r\n\r\nI am a jungle main with a secondary in support. \r\n\r\nI have put up with Lee Sin being in more and more games since Season 2. \r\n\r\nI have put up with traditional supports getting nerfed cause they are \"unhealthy\".\r\n\r\nThis list goes on and on.\r\n\r\nDo you know what it stems from though? Your idiotic and extremely blatant favoritism for characters that are very \"flashy\". \r\n\r\nWhat proof do I have of this? Let us start with the obvious one.\r\n\r\nLee Sin, who has dominated for 3 seasons now. I have literally began begging people in draft to ban him, JUSt so I don't have to see him EVERY single game. And yes, it is that bad. I am not exaggerating. My friends have started treating it as a giant joke. You think traditional supports are unhealthy? What is unhealthy is that out of over a hundred characters, I have to see this annoying idiotic character every single game. That I have to waste a ban to prevent this just so I can see a different character. Or that I have to play him to play against someone else. \r\n\r\nBut you know what is worse then all of that? Is that he isn't bad. He doesn't have a low win rate because he is. He has a low win rate because so many people try to play him and play him badly. \r\n\r\nYou know who else? Leona, Blitz, Thresh, Morgana. You claim that Sona is being nerfed because she is unhealthy? Want me to tell you how full of crap that is? Cause you nerfed her in ALL of the ways that allow these four to body her. You reduced her heal so she can't try to mitigate the damage that them landing one skill shot will bring. You lowered her movement speed so its easy to hit her. \r\n\r\nYou want to know what is ACTUALLY unhealthy for bot lane? How freaking hard you are trying to enforce high kill potential skill shot characters. The characters that if they land a skill shot you should be dead. Cause you know, Leona Blitz have as high a winrate as Sona... yet they aren't touched despite having near four times the play rate. And you know what happens to you when you start losing to them? They start all inning you, over, and over and over again. Cause isn't that fun? What happens if Sona gets ahead? She can all in you once every one and a half minutes. But that's unhealthy. It's unhealthy how she can heal. Its unhealthy her and Janna do alright against the Blitz/Leona combinations. So screw them. They can't be flashy. They can't just win games by killing you over and over again until you want to rage quit unless you can dodge their skill shots, oh wait, we are going to take away your ms so that is harder and harder, CAUSE THATS THE ONLY STYLE OF SUPPORT ALLOWED NOW. \r\n\r\nBut beyond that. What about the reworks? The ones that were highly unliked. The ones that dropped the characters playrates hard? What about Skarner and Cass? Characters I loved and mained who have been butchered by your needless desires to screw everything that isn't mainstream. \r\n\r\nWhat about the tank junglers you have left to dry and alway, ALWAYS give empty promises? Where has nautilus been for two years now? Shyvana stuck at top lane since Season 2. Hecarim? Screw all of them right? As long as Lee Sin remains dominant, and those flashy bruisers. That is all that matters right?\r\n\r\nMid lane? Let's make sure anyone who goes mid has to have stupid high burst potential. Who can all in and escape like its easy. Let's make sure Yasou and Zed never entirely fall out of style. No teamfight/utility mid should remain too long except Orianna.\r\n\r\nI am done with it all.  \r\n\r\nAnd yea, I have moved on. This isn't an empty threat or statement. I have moved to Smite, been playing it all break. Trying to get people to move to it. Cause you know what? I actually see a lot of their characters OFTEN. I can also beat the supposed top tiers semi frequently with my favorite characters which are largely lowtier(except Serquet cause well... serquet). \r\n\r\nUntil you cut the bs and start balancing and stop catering to your glorious ideal high burst fast death game, and not F-ing everyone else who doesn't like that style, I am not bothering with you.\r\n\r\nCircuitbear","replies":[{"poster":"WhereTheNamesAt","date":"2015-01-07T03:33:04.298+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":15,"body":"saw the length of this thread, thought it would be a good readâ€¦a few lines in, realized it was a Lee Sin QQ thread.

Engage, Counter-Engage, and Sustain. Leona, Blitz and Thresh counter Sustain supports like Sona and Soraka, but perform really poorly against counter engagers like Braum, Alistar, Morgana and Nami. \n\nMost support nerfs (Lulu is the big one right now) arise when their gameplay style becomes unhealthy for another solo lane. Supports who are great at supports, aren't great at flashy plays and are staples in competitive play generally go untouched (see Nami)\n\nAnd as for tank junglers...\n\nThe following junglers have been significantly buffed or will be buffed in the next patch or the last few patches.\n\n-Sejuani\n-Hecarim\n-Skarner\n-Maokai\n-Chogath\n-Nautilus\n-Rammus (a buff I love, then a nerf unfortunately due to 60% winrate)\n-Galio\n-Alistar\n\nNot to mention the FANTASTIC Rangers Trailblazer Juggernaut item which is fucking loads better than Golem ever was. Gimme day huge early health spike on Nautilus pls. \n\nLee sin is popular, so what? He has a low winrate. Maybe because people play him badly. You know how much that matters to me? Not at all. I legitimately could care less whether I win against a champ because my opponent is a meta sheep or whether the champ is legitimately underpowered. Who gives a flying fuck, I still won, and if they were bad then they probably looked stupid losing too. \n\nSo you want to play tanks? Pick literally any of them. Their AOEs and cc are nuts in solo Q. Amumu is statistically still the best. You want to play traditional supports? Nami Sona and Janna are great right now, but I tend to play Braum and Thresh against hard kill laners and I do great. Don't knock on thresh just because he's popular-he's one of the most interesting and deep supports out there, when you look past the lcsbighook which is currently in my opinion his weakest, lowest priority move.","replies":[{"poster":"zliplus","date":"2015-01-07T19:02:58.515+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Like you said, tanks have received a lot of buffs, and are mostly quite strong in the late game if played right (usually meaning focusing on peel and counter-engage).

If Lee has a 48% winrate over such a large sample size then not only do I have practice playing against him but him being picked is an advantage to me. I've never had trouble staying away from him as Amumu Sejuani or Hecarim (my usual picks against him) and if he counterjungles me a bit hey, I still have great early ganks and late game I have way better chances than he does. \n\nI get it, he's popular and has unique strengths and obnoxious safeties. When I end up against him as Skarner I know it'll be a tough matchup but I also know that past level six he can't actually duel me anymore and especially not once I get my Trinity Force into full tank going. I have strengths, he has strengths I have to just play to mine.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Afro Skeleton","date":"2015-01-08T06:45:15.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you trashtalking my bronze five?

While I don't agree with how Riot is balancing around Sustain type mages/supports, and showing bias toward some *cough* Janna *cough*, I do think that Sustain needs to be carefully balanced around. Their is a finite line between having too much Sustain, and too little. It's really hard to land on that line. I feel the powerlevel of Thresh/Morg is where it should be.
