My two friends whom also live in my town are having the same issue (Lindsay, Ontario, Canada). Their ping is around the same as mine and they even have good internet. I am not sure what is causing this but it's only with League of Legends. However, all three of us do have the same provider. Now, before you tell me to use the Hextech Repair Tool, I already have and it has done nothing.\r\n\r\nIn game I'm losing trades because dodging is... well dodgey. And I am also having issues with connecting. Sometimes the game starts with it's lovely \"Attempting to reconnect\" crap because it doesn't like me. This costs me the game sometimes. \r\n\r\nEach morning I awake, I test my ping in a bot game, and it never moves from 117 unless it wants to rise. This is quite annoying as my friends really want to play with me. And I really want to get the hell out of S5.\r\n\r\n-Thanks for any help the future might bring.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-18T21:51:41.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're all on the same ISP, this could be an issue where the internet provider isn't routing your connection in a very optimal way. You could reach out to your ISP to see if they're having any known issues, but let's also run a traceroute to see if we can get to the bottom of this. Grab [**WinMTR**](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and use the NA server 104.160.131.1 as the host. \n\nAfter you've run that trace route, shoot the information it gives you my way and we can take a look!","replies":[{"poster":"Malohdek","date":"2017-03-19T03:04:35.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do have a screen shot of what the application is telling me.

If you follow the first line that says 98, you can see that your ping is spiking on Nexicom's servers. \n\nSince the spikes start on their servers, and you mentioned your two friends are on the same ISP, I'd suggest reaching out to them to see if there is an outage or something they could do on their end.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Malohdek","date":"2017-03-19T03:16:32.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So according to the information - a Riot direct server or something is where the high ping is coming from.
