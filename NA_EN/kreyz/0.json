It doesn't even ask me if I want it to uninstall the last update, it just does it. It's getting _extremely_ annoying, any fixes? Been doing this before and after about 3 updates.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-31T01:09:39.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sooooo the client isn't actually uninstalling the recent update. Essentially the client is noticing that some of the update files were corrupted/damaged/or somehow missing and knows that you might crash if it doesn't repatch. If that keeps happening every time you launch the client, you may need to reinstall that patch altogether. Grab our [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and run it with the option **Force Repatch** turned on, and let me know if that helps.","replies":[]}]}
