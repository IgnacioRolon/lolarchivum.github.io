I'm not 100% sure whether we'll be able to convert those tokens for you, but I don't really want to steer you wrong either. I would honestly suggest hitting up our billing team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). That way they can look over your account, see how many tokens would need to be exchanged and whether they've been used or not, and then see how they can help!","replies":[]},{"poster":"takthis2urgraves","date":"2017-06-16T23:44:47.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was also wondering this. I had the order icon on yesterday without realizing it and completed the quests for that even though I have the yasuo skin. Can anyone help?","replies":[]}]}
