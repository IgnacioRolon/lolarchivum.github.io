Personally, I just played around with it for a minute or two, and I found that it took me another 100 ms or so to react to something with the Z/X keys for summoner spells - so that may be a hinderance as 100ms could mean the difference between a flash to safety and a death. That being said, I don't see any way it affects your champion's abilities, so that's not a factor. All in all, who cares what others tell you, you're allowed to play how you want (within reason) :)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-05T22:05:46.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seconding Chermorg on this one! \n\nEssentially, the most important thing is being able to use the tools you have to the best of your abilities. This isn't the normal setup, but if you find it works much better then definitely stick with it!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2017-11-04T20:35:27.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Key choices can be optimized for speed, but unless you're playing at very high levels of play it's not that big of a deal.
