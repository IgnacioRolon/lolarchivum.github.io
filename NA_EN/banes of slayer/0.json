Pretty toxic to start right? Well everyone who thinks that off the bat is my reason number 1 of 5 as to why I&#039;m debating this or any other childish remarks this community makes.\r\n\r\n1. 85% of the time there is a toxic player on your team. Doubtful, selfish, careless, entirely disrespectul and most of the time racist with a hint of autism. Grammar correcting the word &quot;your&quot; (you&#039;re) or pinging enemies are missing when you miss a cs or a last hit on a kill. Why does this bother me? It doesn&#039;t. It bothers everyone else. My team rage quits, cries, feeds, gives up, blames others, afk jungling, and so much more nonsense we all know about. I&#039;m starting to feel like people play this game for no joy at all unless the other team purposely feeds them. It&#039;s one way or the other. You either lose or win, VERY RARELY do you have good games that makes it feel like you can actually play competitively instead of an insta stun your dead Annie every 30 seconds no matter your level. My explanation for toxic players is simple. Riot needs to make the tribunal an ACTUAL JOB. \r\n\r\n2. RANKED QUEUES ARE GARBAGE. I would rather wait 30 minutes to get the exact role I want instead wait 3 minutes to get support when I picked Top/Mid. Where are the alternatives? Some people like to play something else in between games like an MMORPG so waiting seriously doesn&#039;t seem like a problem, agreed? \r\n\r\n3. IP/RP. Riot wouldn&#039;t have to charge so much if they had jobs in the tribunal system. The cost for a silly skin is beyond ridiculous. That&#039;s not even the worst part. You have to pay for rune pages or you have sold your soul to this game to get ready for ranked. The pricess of all of this shit should be CUT IN HALF. EVERYTHING WITH A NUMBER ON IT. You should also be given double the IP that&#039;s normally earned from games and additional amounts from baron/elder dragon/towers and even doubles-tripples-quads-penta&#039;s should reward addition amounts of IP. The first win of the day can then br rewarding a small amount of RP so people with uneven amounts of RP and living paycheck to paycheck can actually look forward to buying something special in a months worth of daily wins giving RP. 975 RP / 30 days is 32.5. Is that too much to ask for a day? Now leading onto my next subject.\r\n\r\n 4. Riot probably won&#039;t consider any of this. I don&#039;t read these forums that often but I can almost guarantee I&#039;m not the only one complaining about tribunal, ranked queues, and how long it takes to get 6300 IP for ONE.. YES..  ONE RUNE PAGE. RIOT does things for themselves, not the community. If they did all these changes or at least close to them I KNOW FOR A FACT people who have uninstalled will come back, people will be forced to do what they download for PLAY A GAME AND HAVE FUN instead of express how they&#039;re apparently dying to cancer so feeding is fine. It&#039;s just mind blowing we have to try sooo hard to have a good time in this moba. You have to have positive people constantly to play with or it&#039;s just a waste of time. \r\n\r\n5. The objections in the comments after this is posted. The toxic kids telling eachother to committee suicide over a opinion on a silly moba. It&#039;s just too much anymore. I jump in an intermediate and have a great covo about how we hate losing to reworks, boosted lux&#039;s, 1 hit annies and the never dying Kled top and Galio jg duo and the unkillable cait+karma or lulu bot team. This game is SOO RELIANT ON COMP IT&#039;S INSANE!! It&#039;s no longer skill or prediction as much as it is counter picks. \r\n\r\nI&#039;ll play league again when tribunal is a legitimate job. When RP is rewarded from first win of the day and getting every champion doesnt take 3.4 years of 2 games a day. When ranked queue&#039;s can be individual gaurenteed roles and also when these challenger scripted new Advanced Bots are removed from Normals. Again, riot does what they want for them, not us. Instead of letting us choose if we want to try testing their new bots for a small aditional IP and whatever icon but actually giving us a choice instead of this (99%) chance (they say its random) to fight these unkillable bots. Anyway, that&#039;s my rant. It would be a miracle if riot listened to at least number 1 on this list.

Fortunately, you can mute all players at the beginning of a game. This actually should be the default for new accounts honestly. Also, this has been said, and I say it again, if you yourself are not afk or trolling, there's a 5 against 4 chance that afkers and trollers will be on the enemy team, so the odds are in your favor over the long run.\n\nAs for the ranked games, I actually agree. It seems they've been pushing the auto-fill mechanic lower and lower down the ELO to perhaps even high silver, which is the average player. The sad part is, if we all even got our roles, it wouldn't even take 30 minutes. It's more like 10-20 minutes, even for people in challenger.\n\nAnd finally about your IP/RP problem, while I do agree, I don't know if I'd agree with the solutions you proposed. There's no doubt that the amount of content the game has has severely increased over the years and given literally no increase of rate to get these, you're looking at thousands of hours to get all the content. I have about 4000 hours or so? Played since season 2 and do have everything, but new players can't possibly imagine to get that. I also played quite a lot. A 100% increase in IP would actually be reasonable, but maybe not combined with the 50% reduction of all items. One of the claims people make that tends to go against is that is because the game is \"free\" so we shouldn't be having the goal of getting all the content. This is just as silly as saying just because an MMORPG is free, you shouldn't be able to play all it's content without spending money.\n\nAnyway, I've talked long enough. Some right, some I'm not sure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"aZ3R0n","date":"2017-04-01T19:55:21.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Banes of Slayer,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=b3qdEA1e,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-04-01T10:25:58.138+0000)\n>\n I'll play league again when tribunal is a legitimate job.\n\nThere is no more Tribunal.
