I have grown incredibly bitter.\r\n\r\nTrolls taking more and more games away from me, and this bitterness is being released on my incompetent teammates, because I do not have any other way to release it. It has grown to a boiling point, and their absolute refusal to surrender even though the enemy team has twice the kills, 6 more towers than us, and our jungler Lee Sin is sitting in base only using flash when it&#039;s off cooldown and the occasional Q is the straw.\r\n\r\nI lash out at my teammates because I feel like a prisoner when I want to play a game of League now. These trolls are locking me into play where I cannot possibly have any fun.\r\n\r\nAnd why can&#039;t I have any fun? Because I want to WIN... And if it&#039;s impossible to win the current game, I want to play one where it is possible. Is that too much to ask?\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s gotten to the point where I threaten said teammates for keeping me in these exhausting situations with tracking them down and inflicting physical violence and psychological trauma upon them. This is not me, it&#039;s a monster that festered inside, growing stronger and stronger as my negative experiences culminated. Because I do not have a proper outlet for this anger which by now has transcended to the point where I&#039;m just holding back my own tears and desperately trying to have fun in a game I haven&#039;t been able to lately.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-10-29T10:04:40.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you dont enjoy the game then dont play it. From what it sounds like you should be looking for a fun single player game.\n\nAnd if you are so caught up in winning, why on earth would you want to surrender, one of the only two ways to lose the game.\n\nEvery game at just about every point can be won.","replies":[{"poster":"Mal the Red","date":"2016-10-29T10:55:41.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know about you.

Btw, I have won games like the one you described in your original post.

It's a game. It means absolutely nothing in the grand scheme of your life. It's sole purpose is to provide you with entertainment. If you aren't having fun playing it, then it's not worth playing. It's particularly not worth having a psychological break over.\n\nIf the net positives of having something in your life don't outweigh the negatives, it's time to remove it from your life.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MUSHROOM MIDGET","date":"2016-10-29T10:39:48.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"its matchmaking.  every player wins/loses about 50%.  just like you.\n\nhttp://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=dyrus","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vormulac Unsleep","date":"2016-10-29T19:31:33.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I feel your pain. \nTHis kind of situation is why I rarely play a game of League - and when I do play, I rarely finish a game. \nYou do your best and it just. doesnt. matter. Your team tanks the match, or one member of your team does so. People refuse to listen. They refuse even to use free wards. They are focused on kills and not objectives. You lose, because of them, and then they refuse to surrender the completely unwinnable match, locking you in and threaten to report you if you dont want to sit and suffer with them. Its ridiculous. \n\nBut Riot is too focused on words in the chat to do anything about this trash.","replies":[]}]}
