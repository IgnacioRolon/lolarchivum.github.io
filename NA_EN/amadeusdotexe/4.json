How has Riot not taken these sites down?","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"_This is not a Riot flaming thread, please know that... Excuse my French please._\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DatKkYt7IPk\n\n**Before I start**: I&#039;ve very recently been learning about what drop hacking is, ddosing, and how to spot scripters. Mainly for self protection, and educational purposes because I&#039;ve never been effected by these types of issues. I&#039;m not an expert on the subject, I&#039;m just a regular league player in the bottom half of ranked community.\n\n**What brought me to this:** So today I was browsing youtube and a compilation of scripters exposed came up, so I watched  it to see the different types so that I could attempt to identify them should it happen to me. I noticed one particularly disgusting hack.\n\nTo put it simply, its basically a hack that allows the user to essentially one shot people with the botrk&#039;s active. The two games that I saw footage of this hack being used in revealed that the users **would not even have Botrk purchased** (the item has been reworked but this was from last year.) One video displayed a Twisted Fate with a GA and sorcerers shoes equipped, casting the active with little to no cooldown. (At 8 minutes I believe) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzShoxvsUCM)\n\nI know that Riot is very responsive to their players and they do everything they can to make the game as pleasant to play as possible and tries to protect players from unfair gameplay. But seeing that there are multiple websites that promote downright infuriating play like this and fucking tutorials on it really pisses me off. I&#039;m more than aware that websites that offer these hacks and &#039;tools&#039; are likely to come with viruses. (People that  try to download them deserve it. Serves them right.)\n\n**The point:** Why has Riot not found a way to get videos and websites that promote this kind of bullshit taken down? Are players clearly shown hacking in these compilations actually punished?? Is there any way for Riot to stop this? Now legal claim or countermeasures? Sites that give out these hacks should not be tolerated or left on the internet!! can&#039;t they have these videos taken own?  Are players discovered hacking by Riot permabanned or warned?? A warning will just make them change their strategy...\n\nI&#039;m sorry if i come off illogical, I&#039;m not well educated on countermeasures for this sort of issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-06-03T05:25:21.578+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most people that hack get banned.

Fighting fire with fire?\n\nDoing that would be HIGHLY ILLEGAL.\nIt doesn't matter wheter or not the website in question is hosting cheating tools or not...unauthorized access to a computer system is a **criminal offense in most countries of the world**, including the United States and Europe.\n\nGaining unauthorized access with the explicit intent of harming the target system...like taking down a website...would be an even more serious offense. But in fact, even ATTEMPTING to gain unauthorized access, wheter or not the attempt succeeds, is already reason enough for criminal charges in many countries.\n\nBecause of that, no white hat would do that.\n\nWhat pentesters (\"white hats\") do, is to test, and harden, the security systems of clients (mostly companies) ONLY WITH THEIR PERMISSION TO DO SO. Before carrying out even the first stage of a pentest (the \"reconnaissance-stage\") there is already a contract and legal agreement signed by all involved parties, pointing out meticulously, what the white hat can, and cannot do. So when he (or usually the ITSec-company the white hat works for) starts a pentest, they are not gaining unauthorized access, because the access has been authorized by the legal entity, that is legitimately entitled to said access.\n\nHacking websites to tear them down legally, is something that can only be done by state authorities, and that usually only within their jurisdiction, and with legal oversight by the countries judicial system (like a court-permission to do so). And even then they can get into serious trouble, if it turns out that the website they target is hosted outside of their states jurisdiction, or if the hack has side effects on such outside-hosts.\n\n**So no, they can't just \"hire some white hats\" and \"fight fire with fire\".**","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-06-03T05:43:53.019+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.insidegamer.net/2017/03/04/riot-games-10m-lawsuit-leaguesharp/\n\nYes, Riot has found a way to deal with these kinds of things.

That's what allows places to advertise store brands as \"Comparable to *trademark*\" - it's fair use to inform the consumer and they aren't directly making money.\n\nIn this case, it could be considered fair use to show Riot gameplay as a) Riot has not objected to people recording and posting gameplay videos in the past and modifying the content can still fall under fair use in certain circumstances b) only enough gameplay was used to get the point across (it wasn't overused) c) the creator of the video was not making money off of it (even if it was monetized Riot would have two options - remove ads altogether or take the monetization, Youtube doesn't remove fair use videos for being monetized).\n\nMore than likely a takedown notice on this would stand because the uploader wouldn't fight it but would just make a new account and re-upload it. That's why you see it, because it's futile to try and remove it, because it's only questionably against any rules/laws, and Riot doesn't spend the immense amount of time it'd take to go through every video ID'ed to have League content to determine if it's acceptable fair use or not.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AMADEUSdotEXE","date":"2017-06-03T05:29:40.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chermorg,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=q7E2EuqJ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-06-03T05:21:19.000+0000)\n>\n> In the United States, where Riot and the platforms you discuss are, for a large part, based, there is not a general method for removing content unless it falls under a few limited exceptions.

And there are 4 big caveats here.\n\n**Number 1:**\nCheating in a video game (unless the conditions I point out below are met) is, by itself, not a criminal act in most jurisdictions. Its a violation of a service agreement in most games, including League, certainly, but if we started to apply the will of service agreements that private companies cooked up to manage freedom of speech, or lack thereof, on the internet, then this world and its society would be in deep trouble...read \"Blade-Runner-Robocop-Dystopia-Kind of trouble\"\n\n**Number 2:**\nIf the cheats interfere with the game servers, for example, Dropattacks and the like, those are criminal acts in many countries of the world. But even then its hard in most jurisdictions, to take down websites which MERELY HOST THE TOOLS TO DO THAT.\nThere are a lot of websites which offer tools for activities that can be potentially illegal, but are also used for completely legal things...for example IT security experts use the Kali Linux Distribution to carry out penetration tests of computer systems to find security loopholes and fix them. This Distribution is hosted on a website, and that's completely legal...despite the fact that, of course, Kali can also be used for basically any nefarious application in hacking and black hat activity in general, that comes to mind.\n**Long story short, just because someone HOSTS tools, doesn't mean hes responsible for what people do with them, and is thus, in many jurisdictions, not doing anything wrong.**\n\nFor the same reason, taking down videos explaining how such tools work is either not easy, or not possible at all. There are 10h long videos which, in exhaustive detail, explain things such as ARP-spoofing or WiFi cracking. Can both be used to do something illegal? Of course. Does that make it illegal to talk about it? Nope.\n\n**Number 3:**\nThe jurisdiction that applies for a potential takedown, is that of the country **where the website is hosted.**\nIt may be the case, that hosting some tool, which is clearly used for nefarious purposes only, is illegal in the US, or EU countries. However, that is irrelevant as far as takedown requests are concerned, if the website is hosted in, for example, Tuvalu, Monaco, Nigeria, Singapur, Micronesia or Nauru. (Yes, all of those exist). A lot small countries actually make a point of having lax legal regulations when it comes to all things internet, precisely because people like hosting shady stuff there...for small economies, the relatively inexpensive task of hosting websites under their TLD (top level domain) is a big source of income.\n\n**Number 4:**\nEven if the jurisdiction of the websites origin would, in theory, allow to take it down, its up to the local authorities to do so. Good luck getting a takedown carried out in some court in god-knows-what country, which may effectively be a dictatorship, with corrupt courts and police, where criminal activities bribe or influence local authorities (or worse: Are tolerated by the local government).\n\n---\n\nAnd a post-scriptum here:\nMost websites in the open internet offering such services, are merely easily replaced front-ends. The actual sources of most of the stuff reside within anonymization networks, such as TOR hidden services.\n\nAnd hitting those with any efficiency, is a challenge even for large intelligence and police networks such as the FBI and CIA.\nA private company can do next to nothing in that area.","replies":[]}]}
