It feels shitty to lose and shitty to win because someone had a dc in a game they could or should have won. It isn&#039;t fun. Riot is obviously capable of this. Why hasn&#039;t it been implemented? AFKs plague this fucking game. The AI don&#039;t even have to be good or teamfight. If you could at the bare fuckin minimum give us an ai that wards where needed (doesnt buy items unless player is clearly building something) and just afk split pushes i&#039;d be fine with that. Its SOMETHING. \r\n\r\nI feel like Rioteers need to be in these kinds of games so they can get where eople are coming from. There&#039;s no advantage to this.

If a teammate disconnects, the bot that replaces them will have no negative impact on the game, even if they repeatedly die. In League however, a bot repeatedly dying will feed gold to the enemy, snowballing games further. You're down a teammate, which makes a lose/lose situation, but at least you don't have a feeding bot if you keep the 4v5.","replies":[{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2018-08-07T16:05:35.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dieing in Hots gives xp to the enemie team, so bots feeding alot would be a big issue.\nThe main difference with Hots is that you can give calls to the bot and say them to follow a specific player, and since teaming up and roaming around as a squad is rather effective in Hots for most maps, this prevents bots from beeing solo and getting farmed.\nAlso, TTK is alot lower in Hots, so it's not that easy to exploit a bot and the other 4 have tome to respond.\n\nStill, at higher elos haveing a bot is basically gg as you can't properly teamfight vs skilled opponents which means you loose the map objectives and with that the game.\nIn low elo however, bots do wonders for Hots...","replies":[{"poster":"LordKentravyon","date":"2018-08-07T16:53:01.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The xp gain is rather small compared to the gold gain\nFurthermore the bot soaking xp will help its team. \nAnd gold a bot gets in league will do nothing for its team.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Baka Red","date":"2018-08-07T13:26:52.539+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would prefer a system in which anyone could queue up with option to act as a replacement player for Disconnected players.

They can be easily gimmicked and have a hard time figuring out where to go. sometimes they stand in 1 place because their AI doesnt know where to go. as for the que for DC players that would be best, but who wants to join a game that is halfway done playing with their runes/items. Will you know the score of the game before going in, would you lose LP in a ranked game if you lose, and so many more un answered questions.
