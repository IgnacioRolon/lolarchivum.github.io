I dont like fighting him.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I&#039;ve never liked fighting him but now that i see him in half the games i play i&#039;m a bit sick of him. Not to meantion for some god damned reason everytime i fight him he refuses to 1v1 me until his jungler decides to gank me 8 times warded and all. He&#039;s relatively simplistic to lane against but i have trouble dealing with his ultimate which i personally have only found zhonyas/flashing/dashing out of it to be a good way to &quot;counter&quot; it. \r\nIm planning on banning him from here on out. But in the event that i lane against him again I&#039;d like to be 1 step ahead {{champion:114}} of him. So ny counter tips/builds/tactics/champions? I&#039;m almost positive Cassiopeia is a good pick against him as long as i don&#039;t get camped by {{champion:154}} . \r\nAlso tips on teamfighting gainst him would be appreicated AFTER he buys zhonyas. I&#039;d like to put the little rat to sleep every time i see him from thi point forward. WHo is the Gren to his Riven?","replies":[]}
