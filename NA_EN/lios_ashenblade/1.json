For starters, always suggest using a hard connection over wifi since that alone is so much better. Next, do you know if your firewall is or has interfered with LoL at anypoint? Let's make sure it isn't now by running through these steps in [**our guide here**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3).
