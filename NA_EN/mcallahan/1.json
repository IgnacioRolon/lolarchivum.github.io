After this game i was given a 14-day suspension for abusing someone in chat ( right after they flamed me and wasted ignite )\r\n\r\nI would like some help with the situation if possible, otherwise i just wanted to make this known to whoever may read this......\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"fizzinurbutt","date":"2017-10-05T04:19:12.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Next time just mute them or ignore the messages from them you flaming doesn't fix anything, it makes it worse. After the game just easily report them and you wont get banned for flaming. It really does happen all the time it would be easier if when a report is submitted and reviewed not only does the one who is reported get checked but all the logs of that game get checked and punishments be handed out. Instead of only the one who is reported get punished. I have seen my friends get banned for that all the time, now when they join a game they inst-mute everyone they don't know and communicate with pings instead of text.","replies":[{"poster":"Mcallahan","date":"2017-10-05T04:21:14.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, ill mute more often, it just sucks that they never took into account that i was being flamed too.
