I wake up this morning and get on league and seen there was a new patch. I updated and halfway through updating it says \"Unspecified error, please check the logs for more information\" I look up a fix for it. All of them were old and for older patches I tried some of  them none of them worked. I just uninstalled the whole client itself and tried reinstalling. Waited an hour and it still says the same error. This is only happening to me for patch 6.6 not sure whats happening but if anyone has a fix or could help me its very much appreciated &lt;3 Thanks so much.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-03-23T20:24:54.606+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you're getting stuck at 33%, it usually means there's some sort of connection error when the client is trying to download the new content.\n\nI'd recommend taking a look at our [Patching Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434) and/or [Connection Troubleshooting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) articles to see if those steps help.
