We hadn't seen any pro play with the nerfs, and also believe that there are counters to Akali that hadn't yet been picked up much (Zil, Veigar, maybe even Renekton as we've been watching in KR solo queue as examples). Nerfing her blindly even further seemed incorrect given her live performance.\n\nKai'sa was already making it through a lot of ban phases in playoffs/regional qualifiers meaning that pros were willing to play against her. We'd nerfed her on 8.18, nerfed several supports frequently picked to keep her safe in lane phase, and buffed some pretty strong lanes against her.\n\nMeddler already touched on Alistar.\n\nWhen it comes to balancing for pro play, a question you always need to be asking is \"ok so who's next?\". If we had swung hard and nerfed Urgot and Aatrox on 8.19, the likely result is that folks like Cho, Ornn, and Sion raise in priority. Nerf Graves, Camille, Olaf, you see more Gragas, Sej, and Trundle. Nerf Kai'sa, Varus, you see more Ezreal Trist, and Xayah (and Rakan as a result of their synergy). \n\nEverything is a tradeoff at the end of the day, and this year we opted for the strategy of buffing more of the counters to the champs at the top as a means of bringing the highest presence and lower presence champs closer to parity rather than just replacing the current top picks with the next in lane champs in the middle. \n\nThis is kind of glossing over a pretty large topic, but hope it sheds some light.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Rouge","date":"2018-10-04T20:01:07.398+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"First off, thank you very much for your response.\n\nRegarding Akali, I appreciate your insight. However, this is the kind of insight that would be appreciated when the patch hits live, not after people (like me) complain. Also, I understand that you wanted to be careful because you hadn't seen pro play with the nerf/didn't consider her counters. This is actually very good arguing against not nerfing Akali further. One thing I think could be useful for this is to talk to pro players going to Worlds about it to get their opinion. After all, they're the ones playing at Worlds. I understand if that's not possible though, so your context is enough.\n\nRegarding Kai'sa, I understand your point a little less. Analysts and pro players were all rating Kai'sa top 2 with Varus, even after the small nerf in 8.18. For buffed strong lanes against her, I'm curious to who you're referring to. For supports, Thresh and Pyke were buffed, but they work just as well into picks such as Varus. For adcs, the only strong pick against her I see is Vayne, and it's not that bad of a counter, at least in lane.\n\n**(Edit: What do you mean Meddler already touched on Alistar?** His last post about Ali was on the 12th of september where he said he should be nerfed, the post i'm referring to.) Alistar is the one I was the most frustrated about. Meddler said, in the same post, that (1) Their philosophy was not to let champions be very close to pick/ban and (2) Alistar, Braum and Rakan needed to be nerfed (yet, only Braum and Rakan got nerfed, with no context as to why Alistar didn't). I can't help but to think that Alistar didn't get nerfed just because he tends to create conflict, like Meddler said. In the end, he wasn't nerfed, and is the most pick/ban out of the supports at Worlds.\n\nI agree, Everything has a tradeoff when it comes to balancing to pro play. I just feel like the top% is so much above a lot of the roster in patch 8.19 that there could have been a lot of small nerfs to a lot of top% champions (since, on the positive side, I think there are a lot of champions at the top% at least). For example, there could have been a medium nerf to Urgot and Aatrox, and a small nerf to runner up champions like Cho, Ornn and Sion (not that I know if these champions needed to be nerfed or not, just going off your example).\n\n**I REALLY appreciate **you going out of your way to shed some light on the matter. I wish this kind of insight would happen without needing to reply to posts like mine however. Anyways, thank you.\n---------------------------------------------\n**2nd edit: Yeah, no, Meddler has not given context at all why Alistar was not nerfed. Could you please elaborate?
