No one ever get chat restricted off of one game.  You didn't.  You may be shown 1 to 5 chat logs as SAMPLE(S) of your toxicity, but they are certainly not the only games you were toxic in.  The only time someone would get punished off of one game is from escalation due to zero tolerance, game play offenses, or perma-bannable offenses like cheating, doxxing, etc.  NOT chat restriction.  You could not possibly know if they already have an account pattern of toxic behavior or that was the one off game where they were toxic in.  Whether that game should pushed their account toxicity history into punishment territory or not is not something you can have any knowledge of.\n\nAlso, you do not always get notification even if your report got someone punished.  So no notification does not mean they didn't get punished.  There's also the fact that it is impossible to stalk someone's account to see if they got chat restricted or not.

Keep in mind also that calling for reports is unnecessary and did contribute to your punishment; it only takes 1 report to trigger a review of one's logs.\n\nMost of your logs are negative, but if you need additional help in pointing out what's negative I'd be happy to help.\n\nAs for your vote: No, it doesn't suck to be you and Riot's not going to fix something ~~that isn't broken.~~\n\nEdit: That isn't working as you'd like.
