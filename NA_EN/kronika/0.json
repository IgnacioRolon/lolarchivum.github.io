I was recently looking for a name change only to see that it was taken. I went to that players profile, to see that their most recent game was in 2014. I feel like this persons summoner name should be available for me to use, as its pretty apparent they most likely wont be returning any time soon. Anyway those are my two cents, and I hope Riot will make this available.\r\n\r\n-Kronika","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-26T20:49:03.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As Zombiemaster mentioned, accounts are susceptible to the [summoner name clean-up](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751914-Summoner-Name-Clean-Up-)!

For accounts levels 1-6, their names will be available after 6 months of inactivity. For higher level accounts, they get 1 month more of inactivity protection for each level they are above 6. For example, level 12 accounts get 1 year of protection and level 30 accounts get 2 years and 6 months of protection.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751914-Summoner-Name-Clean-Up-","replies":[]}]}
