It's kind of like saying who would the majority vote for a new skin {{champion:222}} or {{champion:69}}. Seems pretty one sided.","replies":[{"poster":"Saixos","date":"2015-11-24T11:10:59.016+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That being said, due to the immense number of skins teemo and naut already have not to mention that Diana has been wanting another skin for a while, I think Diana takes the cake.

Also, {{champion:111}} mains saying he only has one 1350rp skin and the rest of his are garbage apparently.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Gixia","date":"2015-11-24T16:17:43.455+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I actually didn't know about this until just now pretty much, and I am actually legit kind of angered by it.\n\nAre we seriously supposed to debate who should get a new skin between:\n\nTeemo, who already has 8 skins, his most recent being a legendary from less than a year ago,\nNautilus, who has 4 skins, his most recent being from less than a year ago,\nand fucking DIANA, who has 2 skins, has only had a single new skin since her release, and it was almost 2 years ago?\n\nFucking SERIOUSLY? {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} \n\nI know that, as an artist, this isn't really anything you're responsible for, but surely somebody in charge has to realize that this is kind of messed up, right? Diana shouldn't have to compete for a new skin, by this point in time she should already be entitled to one, and Teemo has more than enough skins already. I don't actually expect this to happen, but both Teemo and Diana should be replaced in the poll by champions who have a similar skin count to Nautilus to make this an actually fair vote, while Diana should just get a skin regardless of the vote. And Teemo... Teemo should just be ignored and forgotten about entirely.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-11-24T16:27:50.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I'd be more in favor of an Ezreal Skin than a Teemo Skin, if for no other reason than the price points (and quality) available for their skins\n\nTeemo:\n\n- 3x 520 Skins, the lowest price point for really old skins\n- 3x 975 Skins\n- 1x 1350 Skin\n- 1x 1820 Skin\n\nEzreal:\n\n- 3x 520 Skins, the lowest price point for really old skins\n- 4x 750 Skins, the lowest price point for newly released skins\n- 1x 3250 Skin, the highest price point for any skin\n\nThe irony is that when Queen of Diamonds Syndra came out and *everyone* was upset that she was using the default orbs, Riot mentioned that they wanted to make a 750 skin for her so she had variety in her skin prices... but then released yet another 750 skin for Ezreal in that same batch.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blainezy","date":"2015-11-24T03:39:39.823+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kindlejack,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=aJvmVKtj,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-11-24T02:48:50.776+0000)\n>\n> Vote for it Nov. 30!\n> \n> http://www.lolesports.com/en_US/all-star\n\nOh I'm going to.
