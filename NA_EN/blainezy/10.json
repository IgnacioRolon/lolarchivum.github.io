Sometimes, it's because it's tied to an event that we switch on at a particular date - Forsaken Jayce on May (the) 4th (be with you). ;D Other times, it's just so each skin or set of skins get their own chance in the spotlight.","replies":[{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2015-05-28T16:26:08.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about Irelia skin?

That aside, something i've been wondering. I'll take Order of the Lotus Irelia as an example, even though the skin is fine as-is, i think it would look awesome with added lotus and petal particles. Would it be possible at some point to 'upgrade' skins (new particles and stuff) by paying the difference between current and upgraded price (225RP for the 750 to 975 skin)? Obviously this wouldn't work with many skins, but quite a few really would look awesome-er with particles.

His base spikes would clash with the skin - similar to how Warden Nautilus' base shields clashed, so we changed them. \n\nIn Anivia's case, we used colors that could work with the base particles. Personally, I don't think it's a problem because there's cohesion in regards to the color palette. In addition, she did receive a new passive model, which could have matched, but was instead made to look way cooler. ^-^","replies":[{"poster":"SaintCrazy","date":"2015-05-28T17:54:58.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think having Anivia throw rocks instead of ice at her opponents would have made more sense with the Dino theme; Pterodactyls weren't around in the Ice Age after all.
