Answers from the skin team and just the general public in general is something I&#039;m curious about too just to see everyone&#039;s thoughts.\n\n1) Who is your favorite champion? \n\n2) What has been your favorite skin to work on? (general public can&#039;t answer that I suppose)\n\n3) What is your favorite skin?\n\n4) What skin line do you most want to see continued, or maybe even a skin line that you&#039;ve just thought of that doesn&#039;t have a skin line yet?\n\n5) With no ultimate skin this year, are we going to get one next year (which you probably can&#039;t answer anyway)? But, what champion would you want to have an ultimate skin? \n\n6) What is your favorite skin concept you have seen? Either from a player on boards, deviantart, a fellow riot team member, etc?\n\nI guess that&#039;s about it for now. Those are the main ones I&#039;ve thought of. And guess it&#039;s only fitting for me to answer my own questions...\n\n**ANSWERS**\n\n1) Veigar/Syndra\n\n2)haven&#039;t worked on one..\n\n3) My favorite skin is probably Final Boss Veigar. The looks, the effects, the joke.. All of it! Love my evil little mage. Although, this new Super Galaxy Kindred skin is total fire!\n\n4) Elderwood. I know we just got two new ones, but I feel like there are so many more just waiting. Lulu, Zyra (for sure), Maokai, Malphite... Can&#039;t wait to see what comes next! Also Neon Strike.. There's only one .. NEON STRIKE DIANA PLEASE.\n\n5) I know with her low amount of particles, etc, it&#039;s pretty hard, but I&#039;d love to see Katarina with an ultimate skin (heck even a legendary).. Her skins are pretty subpar, even the 975s. I would love to see something that brings more life to her. But more realistic, I&#039;d say Ahri, Veigar or Syndra. Syndra I feel has so much potential in the skin category and she hasn&#039;t gotten a REALLY good one that she deserves, although I will admit I love the snow day one.\n\n6) I&#039;ve seen so many I can&#039;t remember off the top of my head, but my most recent favorite is the Arclight Jhin concept floating on the forums at the moment. It&#039;s great.\n\nLove you all!\n\n----Blainezy","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-04T23:55:42.253+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! ^-^ \n\n**1) Who is your favorite champion?** \nNami! \n\n**2) What has been your favorite skin to work on?** \nAhhh, this is hard. Firecracker Jinx was a ton of fun to work on. I'd say Blood Moon Elise is a close second, though. :)\n\n**3) What is your favorite skin?** \nArcade Sona.\n\n**4) What skin line do you most want to see continued, or maybe even a skin line that you've just thought of that doesn't have a skin line yet?** \n\nI think more PROJECT skins would be awesome. I'm likely a bit bias 'cause I had a blast working on PROJECT Fiora. If not PROJECT, I'd probably cast my vote for more Arcade skins!\n\n**5) With no ultimate skin this year, are we going to get one next year (which you probably can't answer anyway)? But, what champion would you want to have an ultimate skin?** \n\nYou're right, unfortunately, I can't drop any details on that one. :c As for who I'd like to see get one - I'd love to see something along the lines of a Four Seasons Zyra we had a discussion around on the boards a few weeks ago. \n\n**6) What is your favorite skin concept you have seen?

I'm thinking an ultimate skin for a Kha.  Like Ultimate predator Kha something that doubles down on his evolution making him more feral and primal\n6.
