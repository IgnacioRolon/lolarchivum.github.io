I do feel like they were a little lost on direction when trying to map her out, but when you realistically look at Diana's kit it hard to come up with ideas.  I've tried. I'm happy with it, the sword seems elegant, I like how thin it is compared to the normal skin. As a Diana main I've been waiting for this for ages. Lunar Goddess was amazing and all, but it got old. I give it an 7/10.  I wish the hair looked a bit better. I like it on fire and stuff, but I\nm just a fan of long locks.","replies":[{"poster":"Blainezy","date":"2016-04-06T14:07:58.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's really nice and I love all the particle effects, especially with her E. When team fire won I immediately envisioned her being a fireball when she halted and they did that so I'm very happy about that. Lunar goddess and dark Valkyrie are just meh recolors. Which is what I fear they will do to a blood moondiana. But for now, I'm more than happy with this new skin.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DragonSlayrDiana","date":"2016-04-06T03:49:12.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To me, a fellow Diana main, it looks like all the effort went into the taric rework and SKT skins rather than this skin... It looks like wildfire Zrya with particles directly from ember spirit in Dota 2 and it's pretty disappointing especially for 1350 rp. Not purchasing this one :/ I'll stick with lunar goddess I guess until a blood moon/lunar wraith one comes out that's worth buying","replies":[{"poster":"Blainezy","date":"2016-04-06T14:06:21.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's quite different. Wildfire Zyra is very lame and isn't very fiery. Infernal Diana had really nice particle effects, especially with her E and she's a FIREBALL when she ults. Lunar Goddess is depressing as a skin. It's just a bright recolor, and while I am excited for if and when a blood\nMoon Diana comes out, I fear it will just be a red recolor.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Celio Hogane HD","date":"2016-04-05T20:03:15.544+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Sure, Boobplate, why not, is not like we have all her skins sexualized.\n\nwhatever, im just tired.
