I also like the fact that in some posts recently (Jhin&#039;s for example), that y&#039;all have posted concepts of his evolution through development. I was just wondering if at all possible if you all (*cough*KateyKhaos*cough*) could possibly look into to releasin concept art of skins you have released and their evolution through time... Not like all skins, but maybe some of the bigger ones like the legendaries and ultimates.... Maybe even that new Diana skin *wink wink* \r\n\r\n   Blainezy\r\n\r\nP.S- about that Diana skin...? Can we have any sort of information on it? I loooove Diana! Nearing 100k mastery points. I&#039;m eagerly awaiting this skin and hope it&#039;s epic!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-09T17:48:54.098+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Blainezy! \n\nWe [have been](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/riot-games/editorial/snow-day-art-snowdown) trying to share a bit more art - I think it's an awesome way to show you the work that goes into the skins, but also to show you the process that we work through!

I'm no artist myself, but I love reading and looking at things like that. \n\nI don't expect her to be done, I knew it would take time to develop the Diana skin since you didn't know which team was going to win. I was just wondering how far along it was. I am super excited for her though, so I can't wait to see her!

Having a Battlecast version of every single non-humans out there? Damn right i'd take it! While Steel Legion for now is Demacia, Project already goes to Targon, Ionia and Demacia. There's no reason not to do all the champs for both skin lines, provided you just find the right designs!\n\nGranted that'll take a bit of a while. But hey, when you want to do an all-skin theme, it widens your options so no one can really complain.\n\nThat said, there's never enough different skin lines and at the same time there's almost too many for you guys to follow up on already. There's a few older skin lines that i feel deserve some love too. But that's just me.\n\nThanks for your time anyway!","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2016-02-15T06:31:21.257+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel the same way! But let's do some quick maths; if we have ~130 champs and plan on releasing as many new champs as we did last year every year (5-6) then even if we did a PROJECT patch of 5 skins every single year we would never get any closer to giving every champion a PROJECT skin. And we aren't planning on doing 5 of the same skin line every year (outside of the World Championship skins of course).\n\nIf we wanted to give every single champion a PROJECT skin, with animation, particles, SFX etc. let's see how long that might take. We produced ~60 skins of this calibre last year so if we can keep that up it'll take more than two years of nothing but project skins to have one for every champion. If we want to do the same for a few more of our popular thematic suddenly we are looking at 6-8 years! We'd probably go mad from doing the same stuff over and over too :P \n\nAs I said though, I feel the same way and when the right champions come up I always like to suggest popular skin themes for them.
