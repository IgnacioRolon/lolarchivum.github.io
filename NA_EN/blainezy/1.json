I am super excited about this LB skin! She needed it! She doesn't have much in the way of cool skins. Ravenborn LB is the closest thing she has and thats over a year old now.

Champs that haven't had a skin that long deserve for you to drop whatever \"thematic\" concept group you are working on and give them a skin.
