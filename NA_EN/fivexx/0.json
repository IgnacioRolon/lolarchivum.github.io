Most recently was an Honor Reward chest, clicked the \"OK\" to acknowledge it and then did not receive any items, or the chest to be opened. What gives? are these showing up somewhere without any notice to the player? Quite frustrating to receive a Punishment feedback notice every few games due to the toxicity of the community, and then having my \"Rewards\" go missing for being a socially conscious player.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-12T22:48:10.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Honor Reward you saw was most likely a notification for getting your End of Season Honor 4 Ward Skin reward. It was automatically redeemed to your account which is why you don't see it in your loot. Double check your ward skins next time you go into champ select for that!","replies":[{"poster":"Fivexx","date":"2017-11-13T02:56:16.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I checked through all my skins, ward skins and \"Loot\" tab, nothing to be found and this is not the only chest I have \"lost\"","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-13T03:40:36.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You didn't get an honor chest just then, it was a notification about the Honor Ward Skin. The Honor Ward was added to your collection directly as I mentioned, so you won't see it anywhere outside of Champion Select. Do me a favor and enter into a custom game champion select, then take a picture of your list of wards. You should see it there, and if not we'll be able to fix that up.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
