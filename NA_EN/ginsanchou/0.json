And it&#039;s my recent chat restriction and the overwhelming feeling of suicide creeping over me. By posting here, I am getting out my thoughts and  hopefully staving off an action. I will be getting support tonight to handle my mental health. \r\n\r\nthe thread: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/wbtd3a7d-another-it-can-happen-to-you-thread\r\n\r\nI have to wonder , out of the hundreds if not thousands of people penalized/banned from league of legends, how many of them went on to self harm/kill themselves? Or how many salty assclowns drove someone to suicide and are still playing today. How many people could not just take this as a game, depended on it for support, and were let down.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m going to posit that this ifs system may be &quot;Working as intended&quot; but isn&#039;t &quot;working as it should&quot;. \r\n\r\nI feel like no actual weight is given to the individual in question: how often they get bullied by other laners, how often they offer constructive chat, how often they support other  people getting bullied by others. How often they mute and move on.\r\n\r\nI feel like all we have is a &quot;negativity score&quot; based on how often we are reported and the severity of our chat.  And the higher that negativity score creeps, the more likely  we&#039;ll catch a penalty for something minor.  For defending ourselves. For playing into a trolls plan to get you to say something stupid. \r\n\r\nI feel like the concept of a &quot;POsitivity score&quot; was supposed to be the honor system, but it&#039;s total seperation from how the  IFS works  causes undue pain and frustration in people. \r\n\r\nThis isn&#039;t anything that hasn&#039;t been said before. BUt Right now, as I  stare at the weapons in my house, the  knives in the kitchen drawer, the blank sketchbook page I have open and  the empty cannabis vial I have on my desk, I feel like a very important discussion has yet to have taken place..... a discussion which might actually improve the IFS system for the better than some  of the other cases I&#039;ve seen made on here. \r\n\r\nHow people feel getting penalized  when they get bullied so often in game.  HOw people feel  when they have hundreds of positive/constructive games  and one troll managed to catch them penalty.  How it&#039;s impossible to see BEFORE YOU CATCH A PENALTY just HOW CLOSE YOU ARE to catching one. \r\n\r\nI made a thread  about a week ago wondering if Riot did manual audits on accounts on request to share with the player in question. No one really answered that question in a good way. MAybe it&#039;s time to suggest that a toxicity meter or some sort of visible metric could be visible to people .  Exploitable, yes, but would it help people? \r\n\r\nMaybe its time to implement some sort of in-game/client  warning when an identified positive player gets close to  catching a penalty. \r\n\r\nNo one knows how it feels to lose a person to a video game until it happens to them.  And it&#039;s happened to me. For every , lets say, 10,000 salty buttholes penalized, 1  of them is  deeply affected to the point of self harm.  I will never get my friend back, but  I can at least help to prevent others from feeling how I/they/everyone else who knew them felt.  That&#039;s what I do when I report people for typing K%%.   And it&#039;s what I&#039;m hopefully doing now by bringing this up","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-02-16T21:32:46.814+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are not going to guilt riot into unbanning you.

It will not escalate to a ban by accident unless you continue to do whatever it is you did.\n\nThey dont track false positives, because the number is very low and the effort involved would be immense.\n\nIf someone is doing something that they feel should not trigger a CR/ban and continues to do it repeatedly after a warning, well.. it is more or less entirely their fault no matter how justified they feel.

A warning, a chat restriction, a suspension, a CareBear ecard asking them to find their heart... They are all pretty equally effective. That's why the number of punishments is set to a specific number.

I know for a fact if /I/ felt this strongly about recieving a penalty, someone else out there felt it even worse than I did and did something stupid. More can be done to support people on the edge. More can be done to provide feedback. \nMore can be done to /reduce the number of penalties put forth/ in  a way that still accomplishes reform. Even in that small population vacuum you refer to. \n\n> Additionally, I think you&#x27;re not understanding my comment about how people react to punishments.

I'm saying  we should add more layers of feedback to it. I'm saying clarity needs to be put forth. A suggestion that comes to mind is that  the IFS should be adjusted to warn players they were close to a penalty... but I am NOT saying  that the current threshhold needs to be highered (hired? autocorrect not giving me anything) or lowered. People need to KNOW if they came close, but didn't catch a penalty. People NEED feedback BEFORE their hearts are broken like mine almost got.\n\nEdit: or at least a way to get proper evaluation from an official source\n\n I ALWAYS expected I would get a warning /BEFORE/ a penalty, /because/ I've never had said penalty. I've seen the warning screen on streams. I know it exists.  But one game is all it took to cross the line because of some bad things I said that sound really bad in context. Because I tried to explain my teams side. Because I defended my pick. It makes me believe that I've been flagged and the system has been WAITING to catch me with a linecrosser.  And if that simply isn't the case,  I have to take this at face value that while I engaged in toxic behavior(refer to other thread), what I said BEFORE it sealed my fate in a way that I  just can't agree with. \n\nI would have liked to have known /on the card/ what exactly the penalty was for, as I can bring this to the forums all day and they can speculate all night but unless a Rioter walks in I'd be clueless as to what exact mistake I made(or if I was truly the victim of what I termed to be called \"keywording\")","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2018-02-17T03:47:19.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I ALWAYS expected I would get a warning /BEFORE/ a penalty, /because/ I've never had said penalty. \n\nA 10-game chat restriction is effectively a warning.","replies":[{"poster":"Ginsanchou","date":"2018-02-17T05:35:33.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ulanopo,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=U9O0URx5,comment-id=00060000000000000000,timestamp=2018-02-17T03:47:19.946+0000)\n>\n> A 10-game chat restriction is effectively a warning.\n\nI suppose I 'm just of the opinion that merely adding the one layer would  open up more possibilities. IF even one person avoids becoming more toxic without the need for an escalation. I feel like that's a win.  The permanent black mark picked at my brain and my soul. My reduced and locked honor felt like a stain on everything I held dear to this world. But that was all the catylyst to what  happened to me today.\n\nI've seen the rising trend in sadness across this board. I've read many different things and they disturb me. At the back of my mind, I take every individual here on this board as someone whose lives have been ruined for just a small amount of time, over 100 times(number relating to the number of games one has playeD). \n\nI relate my emotions to individual experiences. Across seconds. Across Weeks and years. I live the loop of trying to live in this world millions of times a day.  People depend on games in this day and age to keep them sane. To relax and forget. For some, it's their only socialization. Many don't have the words, the time, or the energy to come here and relate their experience. Progress in a game is their only tether to reality while they search for answers. What to do. What to wear. What to eat. WIll they have enough money to support themselves. Whether their lives are even sustainable in this ever changing world. Can ANY resources be put forward  to prevent even /just one person/ from having to feel what I feel on a daily basis?\n\nFor some people, they don't want to relive the fear they feel in daily life by coming here to talk about what they felt. Their problems are more important to them than a silly old game, but that one good game could have saved their life. How easy it's teeter over the edge and do something stupid.\n\nI'll reiterate that merely feeling like doing it is a deeper experience that anyone will realize.  And as a person who experiences every individual moment as a thousand lifetimes(by choice), I can relate to the total important of seconds in time being a factor in someones life.  \n\nI didn't do anything today. But I felt that urge. I felt that tug.  I relive this so many times a day, it hurts. But I always have. And I always will. I know this about myself. \n\nI guess I'll just come out and say it. \n\nI've been calling out for help in the chat logs. \n\nI felt like even just one person might be listening and send out a personal warning or something. \n\nOne support staffer who would read what I wrote and check if I was ok with a suspension and an email. \n\nONE person to check after the game if I was alright with a friend request. \n\nEven just a canned message  in a popup about the suicide hotline  given after a particularly hard feed where I could have keyworded \"I hate my life \" or some variant thereof. I don't know what I wanted. I just wanted someone to care. To know someone had my back at Riot.\n\nNothing ever came. I continued to call and there was no answer. \n\nI live every day in a constant state of thinking of what I can do better because I live life on a matter of seconds. \n\nCan even ONE needlessly ended life be saved by even making ONE little change that maybe helps 100 or so people over the course of its lifetime to reform? Without taking that next step? In this world of bots and computer language and other technical jargon buzzwords like neural net processors and things like that? \n\nIn a matter of seconds, a life can be gone. Can SOMETHING be done to ensure that people don't end up like I almost did, even just for that little split second as the world came crashing down, everything was meaningless, and I  felt like  taking the plunge? Even as, as I always have, and I always will, I snapped back and reminded myself why I continue to live, and it's in spite of these shitty feelings, it's in SPITE of all the people who cause me pain, it's in SPITE  of ALL those people who call me a coward for not conforming to their  ideals and or for MERELY FUCKING NOT PICKING A META ADC....\n\n*breaking down crying talking about that last one*\n\nSuch a LITTLE  stupid thing that picks and picks and pick and PICKS AND PICKS AND PICKS AND PICKS AT YOUR BRAIN because it doesn't matter HOW MANY GAMES YOU PLAY people ALWAYS WANT YOU TO DIE because YOU WONT PICK A FUCKING META ADC. It STARTS the SPIRAL. Even though it's your best. Even though it's what you play for fun. Because this game is fun,  Were all having fun here right? You're supposed to play what you enjoy to climb Right? RIGHT? THATS HOW I MADE GOLD I PLAYED THE F%%%ING  THRESH INTO GOLD. \n\nLook, I get I'm being watched for even making this thread and ADMITTING TO ANYTHING because in this world and age we HAVE TO be on the lookout for those who might be hurting inside and to make sure they have help. For the sake of ANYONE who came as close to I did  and DO ON A DAILY BASIS as part of a  LOOPING CYCLE of mere EXISTENCE. But I'll survive. I know why I have to. I have purpose. It just takes some reminding sometimes. And its making sure AS MANY OF US survive as possible. It's a purpose I've had for a long time. It's what gets me up in the morning and drives my ideals. MY projects. What I will bring to this world  to make sure we all move forward without needless loss of life. \n\nBut IF this happens even ONCE more to some other person but they don't have the sense to bring up their experience, is it just another vague obituary in the newspaper?\n\n\"Died from depression. Work and love life bleak. Played Video Games Alot\" \n\nI will leave it at this, I can't think of anything more that","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ginsanchou","date":"2018-02-18T17:43:21.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Am I still being treated as just a shitposter?\nThis issue caused me genuine emotional distress.\nBeing \"right\" in League was all I had while my mind worked on something better. \nProving my strategies were useful became everything I lived for.\nI can see ways my situation can be avoided.\nAnd I don't really know what I want with this topic anymore... maybe just to know I wasn't ignored again and that my story is really being taken into consideration?\n\nIt comes to mind that lots of people judged me for this post.
