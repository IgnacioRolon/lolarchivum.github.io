Therefore, they deserved it.\n\nAlso, since they defeated other challenger teams in tournament play, we can deduce that those other teams would have done worse in LCS anyways","replies":[{"poster":"AxlStream","date":"2015-03-31T14:38:14.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh sure they \"made\" it.

You just wanted to put the board up, which is all too common. Maybe you have some games that are \"tragic\" as you describe, but generally, I've seen more bad sportsmanship than true hopeless situations. Also, Volibear only managed 8 kills, so he didn't really pad that KDA, as suggested.\n\nYou were also a frontliner who took similar damage to enemy champions (2 took way more), though they clearly had the damage advantage. That suggests to me that you made an effort to stay out of the fray, as Braum. Yeah, if you don't want to play, you should just not join the game instead of quit in the middle. I can't say you directly trolled in fountain, but you at least sat back and slung Ice Smashes, which is generally useless to the team. I'm surprised they managed 14 kills, especially with a 0-8 Riven top and a satellite Braum.\n\nCorrection: I don't actually believe you were satellite Braum anymore. You dealt more physical damage than Cho, and with no AD buffs whatsoever. Instead, I think you quit because team wouldn't surrender. That would explain satellite Cho actually taking more damage than you. This is exactly the problem with the surrender function as a whole. It gives people incentive to up and quit, so that maybe their teammates will put up the board for you because you're being sour.","replies":[{"poster":"AxlStream","date":"2015-04-01T17:08:13.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I exaggerated a bit but point is, I usually know by 20 if the game is winnable or not. Not only because of score but also how you play. The Riven that kept wanting to fight the fed Voli and the failure to kill him 4v1 was enough to call it. Since leaving a match you don't enjoy is not an option, I just tried to farm and pray the enemy would grow some balls to end it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Chris Silent","date":"2015-03-30T04:23:06.435+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"you could always drag it to the side lol","replies":[{"poster":"Danica1708","date":"2015-03-30T04:34:10.996+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is, it's already kinda to the side but still distracting.
