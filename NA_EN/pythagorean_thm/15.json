When the patch was rolled out, we were told that the new, full lores couldn't fit in the client because they were too long and would be on the website within a month. A month came and went and they posted some of the lores here. Since that time, a grand total of 3 lores have been posted on the forums. Sion got his updated lore put in the game, which seems to fly in the face of the old explanation for why lore needed to be off-loaded.\n\nWhat kind of *'Technical Issues'* have come up with posting the update lore on the forums? What kind of *'Technical Issues'* keep the site update from actually happening?\n\nTo be honest, I think there are more Management Issues at play here than Technical ones.  I have a hard time believing that the IT staff in charge of updating the lore on the website didn't test things before hand and realize there was a problem. Someone said \"go ahead and delete the lore for those champions from the client anyway\". I ***can*** believe that some challenges came up with actually implementing the website changes. I ***can't*** believe the changes needed to make things work take four months. I ***can*** believe there is feature-creep for some fancy new website that does more than is needed right now.\n\nLets also be honest, lore is a third-world citizen in a first-world game. If this was a promotional icon that wasn't showing up with a new skin, it would be fixed in the week, no matter how many lines of code needed to be changed. Same with the textures for a skin, or the animations, or any other aspect of League of Legends. \n\n\\*sigh\\* \n\nI just want the real reason for why things are being delayed. Is it too much to want Riot to be honest with us?","replies":[{"poster":"Darrosh Jewfist","date":"2015-01-08T23:45:57.836+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"The idea of management issues is what I lean towards as well. \n\n**THE FOLLOWING IS PURE SPECULATION AND TIN-FOIL HAT CONSPIRACY.**\n\nTechnical issues involving text limits is... seriously? It doesn't take 4 months to write these champ bios. But I can totally imagine a room of 5-6 people spending 4 months agonizing over how this is going ruin their future plans.\n\nJudging by how the narrative leadership went through a recent flux, and probably still is going through staff shuffling, and with so many hands in the narrative it isn't surprising the lore is not going in many places. They probably started off with a grand vision, but couldn't realize it since lead went on and now that visions changed. So you've probably got staffers who still miss for the old unapologetic so-bad-it's-good JoJ/IoW era lore, the grand vision narrative lore they seem to be going for, and the scattered visions of various others in the narrative.\n\nI'm just guessing that they haven't quite hammered down their vision yet and they certainly don't seem in a rush to do much (given the War of Three Sisters Freljord storyline has been stagnant for 3 years). \n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if a narrative conference is a lot like a UN Security Council meeting where everybody has some veto power. A single veto, and the entire thing gets stopped. There's probably a load of content prepared at this point (if there isn't any content prepared, then narrative would just seem incomptent incompetent), but they can't decide what to release because of the backlash phobia. \n\nA ship with so many captains and navigators isn't going to get many places. And they definitely want to avoid another retcon with huge community backlash. \n\nThrow in the fact you've got an increasingly corporate and e-sports-centric Riot that wants to showcase League of Legends as a professional image, and distance itself from the previous-era's \"goofy\" lore. It also explains why a lot of the newer champs and reworks show more grim-dark serious characters rather than old school Sions or joke champs - Riot just doesn't want to be associated with that anymore.\n\nIn a way, this is the opposite of what happened to Blizzard. Blizzard started off with wildly successful franchises that told epic, engaging stories. The Starcraft 1 monologues in the briefings and random unit banter and atmosphere was masterful. It had the grimdarkness of Warhammer without the sheer terminology overload. \n\nThen Starcraft 2 comes around and everything gets comical. Rather than keeping a Nolan-equse (we are sorry this is a superhero film but we are trying to be serious), they opted for... rather generic lore with artifacts, prophecies, and **Zerutal OMG WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU**?\n\ntl:dr My theory is that Riot started off as that fun, nerdy kid in glasses but realizes if he takes off the glasses he can be one of the dime-a-dozen popular kids.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2015-01-08T21:09:20.321+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":30,"body":"Who here is enjoying these patient and not all whiny fans?
