Riot is discussing their decision, but they are NOT here to make your wishes into reality. They found that the whole League thing (which was akin to tournaments from Tekken or SF, an excuse to connect a bunch of hugely varied chars) wasn't working for them and decided to do what writers should when stuff isn't working; get rid of it and now the community is crying like some freakin' Shakespeare's work was lost or how all future stories are ruined.

You give money for certain in-game items. That's it. You might argue that the ability to use these products in the game is tied in with that purchase (which would ridiculously mean Riot is prevented from shutting down the game), but anything besides that, especially lore, is completely irrelevant and cannot be paid for. You paid for skins. You did not pay for lore. Riot can do whatever the heck they want with it.\n\nSecond, even if you were paying for this game, and you're not, you would be paying for playing the game, not for the game itself (which is subject to change). You are not buying stocks. You are not paying for the right to tell Riot what they can or can't do with their game. They are fully within their rights to completely change or shut down the game and anything in it if they want to because it's THEIR game.\n\nThird, the creator is in no way obliged to listen to your wishes. You are merely an audience for their product and even if they ask for your opinion, they don't have to listen to it. You are NOT another creator, you are NOT an adviser and this game is not and cannot be yours. And if you think Riot's willingness to talk to its audience means they are asking you to create their content for them or asking for your permission to make any changes, you might see the reason why so many companies refuse to have a 2-way communication with its users. Because it creates precisely this spoiled, entitled view that the audience is allowed to not just criticize, but downright insist the company do what they tell it to do.\n\nFourth, all this is completely subjective. We are not talking bugs or performance issues or other things that objectively lower the quality of a product. We are talking creative differences.\n\nAnd \"breach of consumer protection laws\"? Are you kidding me with this? Do you go see a movie and then cry \"breach of consumer protection laws\" when the movie ends up being not to your liking?

You also argue that customers expecting the original product they came for makes them spoiled and entitled, which is the argument Bioware's two presidents used back during the Mass Effect 3 fiasco.\n\nIt got both of them fired by Electronic Arts by the way, but not before Bioware got sued and lost for *false advertisement and breach of consumer protection laws*.\n\nAnd incidentally yeah, Electronic Frontier Foundation recently filed paperwork for a law that forbids you from abandoning your video game without providing a way for players to keep playing it, arguing that it would “allow players to continue to explore and play games they already own, and help preservationists remove authentication mechanisms in order to format shift games so that future gamers may enjoy and learn from them.”","replies":[{"poster":"Kobila2000","date":"2014-11-28T15:53:20.590+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"I see you fail to realize that LoL is a game subject to change.

People started drawing [joke fanart](https://www.tumblr.com/search/tryndamere+initiative) because of it.\n\nThese two sentences run contrary to each other.\n\n> Why do you think they changed the game to be more creative?\n\nDefine more creative. The Shurima event was notoriously badly written, its narrative logic constantly kept sabotaging itself and Xerath's lore was ganked from a famous manga. Kalista has literally one personality trait and cannot actually participate in the narrative because doing so would require murdering an important character. Gnar doesn't talk. Rek'sai is a rip-off of Tremors.\n\nCreative isn't anywhere near there.\n\n> And where exactly did they insult their customers for criticizing them?\n\nDismissing people's arguments as \"mere disagreements\" and saying he doesn't even want to acknowledge any community-created content pertaining to old lore *is* insulting.\n\nFurthermore,\n\n> You being a paying customer is, frankly, irrelevant. The company owes you nothing just because you gave them money for a certain service. You liked a skin or a rune page, you paid for it. You did not give them charity or do them any favor. If you don't like the changes, you are free to leave. I personally think these changes are for the better.\n\n\"So long as a company is doing things I prefer, all other people in the community are irrelevant. I'll encourage the company to drive any customers who disagree with me away, and will in fact tell those customers that their money and loyalty to the company is worth nothing.\"\n\nThat is basically what you're saying. Having the gall to call people entitled after that paragraph is pretty shameful.\n\n> When a game changes something and you dislike it, you're well within your rights to criticize it, no-one blames you for that. What you are not allowed to do however, is cry that it's a \"breach of consumer protection laws\" when a game is taking a direction that you personally don't like, as if the company should be forced to change its creation based on your tastes. Lore is just a bit of an added flavor to a champion. It's dubious how sellable it is. JoJ for instance, was discontinued precisely because not enough people were interested and it wasn't paying off. What Riot is currently doing with their cinematics is far more effective in attracting players.\n\nHave you actually seen discussion of the recent cinematics? Because most out-of-League discussion deems Shurima videos as \"so bad they're hilarious\", criticized Warriors as \"self-indulgent\" and dismissed Rek'sai as a rip-off of DOTA2's Weaver.

The fact is, while I'm not paying for LoL or rights to affect its creation, the matter of fact is that I'm still a paying customer and when a game goes and alters a major aspect of what attracted me to it in the first place, it shouldn't surprise anyone when I become critical of that decision.\n\nThe matter of fact is that Riot do want to make their lore more marketable and worth paying money for, but the critical issue is that their approach so far has been better at alienating their audience than improving customer loyalty. At this point, none of the people I know would pay for any lore-related products because they either find the new direction boring and unoriginal, or are put off by the narrative team's behavior on the forums.\n\n> I didn't play Mass Effect so I'm not familiar with the whole fiasco.\n\nMass Effect 3 had a ending that was completely disconnected from the rest of the game and choices made during it, despite the game being actively advertised as being affected by your choices.

You must be blind if you haven't noticed this change and it sure as hell didn't happen because Riot suddenly had a revelation. The Sejuani rework is this change in a single before-after example.\n\nYes, they released three decently dressed champions and one who is essentially just a cockroach with a female pronoun.\n\nOn the other hand, they released Forecast Janna who reimagines the character as a dumb blond in a miniskirt, put out Arcade Miss Fortune which builds on the incredibly gross and sexist \"gamer grrl\" stereotype, and they released a bunch of updated splash art that completely objectifies the characters. Ashe, Miss Fortune, Vayne, Caitlyn all have splash arts that are anatomically impossible and prioritize showing off their \"assets\" rather than combat skills.\n\nLeague's current art direction is being very actively discussed as embarrassingly sexist, you'd know that if you simply searched \"league of legends\" and \"sexism\", or if you read comments in news websites' articles.\n\n> In-game creative. More decision-making in the jungle, more adaptive build paths, less win-at-champ-select-ness.

I could go into detail why I think the new changes are meh, but this isn't the forum for it.\n\n> LoL as a story? Creative? Please. It was always centered on copying popular tropes. It was always low-brow entertainment. Or are you telling me a game with a werewolf, a troll, a Spartan, a pirate stripper, a mummy, a viking and a ninja hamster is the perfect one for deep storytelling?\n\nAny game can be perfect for deep storytelling. My current projects include a brawler, a retro platformer, a turn-based strategy and a visual novel. None of them require less narrative effort than the other. In fact, when I pitched to an idea of a time management/date-sim where the player is a \"radio support\" in a organization similar to the Institute of War, I had several people lining up to code the thing for me.\n\n> Yes, dismissing people's arguments is completely acceptable when they're not even willing to talk about your current work or if they downright humiliate and insult you. And not wanting to acknowledge fanworks is completely acceptable. Like are you kidding me? This is freakin' normal for artists, in some places employers are even forbidden to look at fanworks to avoid copyright issues. They even clearly stated (at least on the old forums) that when you post your ideas you shouldn't expect Riot to make them into reality because they aren't your personal art service.\n\nPeople did talk about the current work. Have you somehow missed the part where the reason people are no longer interested in following the narrative team's efforts is because every single piece of criticism is dismissed as a \"creative disagreement\", even in cases where people are calling out actual faults such as poor sentence structure and lack of narrative logic?\n\n> And no, I don't like a lot of things Riot's doing. I hate the new mobility creep. I hate some of their champions. I think the lore (both now and before) is bad and undeveloped. And I genuinely can't see how their writers can't write an engaging story and do it at a pace faster than a glacier. I hate a lot of their recent skins. But the fact remains, it's their work. And as an artist, it disgusts me that people will treat your work as their personal idea dump just because you managed to make it successful and they couldn't. It's Riot's world, you're just living in it. Snap out of your little creator fantasy and go write your own crap, or let these people do their job. If the current workers are bad, Rito will hire new ones like they did with their splash arts. They should under no circumstances give a ton of anons the reign to do what they want with their story, that's the worst thing you can do.\n\nOh boy, the old \"if you think you're so good, go write your own stuff\" argument! Because none of us heard it or anything.\n\nHere is the thing - I *do* write plenty of my own content and I put a lot of work into ensuring that none of it is \"crap\". And as a creator, I have reached the point of maturity where I'm comfortable with having my work criticized just as I am comfortable with criticizing the work of others. And when people to whom I provide criticism react in a juvenile and dismissive manner, then my opinion on their ethics as creators and businessmen *will* drop.\n\nAnd the fact is, far as everyone knows, this isn't *their* work.

I have read some \"classics\" which the majority of people know about just from movies vaguely derived from them. I have studied Latin literature in its original form, taking great pleasures from the likes of Cicero and Titus Lucretius Carus. But I have dabbled in Poe's stories too and Lovecraft and other modern literature like sci-fi renown masterpieces such as the Foundation series of Isaac Asimov. I, of course, being a man of the '90s, have engaged in some popular contemporary series of these past two decades as well.

I was taught how to carry a literary analysis and was pretty damn good at it, so don't *assume* that since I liked some aspects of the old LoL's lore I do not have any education in the subject, because *I do have one* and you can't dismiss my observations just as those of some kid not knowing what the (literary) world is.\nMy memory may be rusting since I've chosen university studies in physics, but I hold myself rightly as able to discuss literature and recognize bad and good narrative when I read some.\n\nSincerely yours,\nSummoner Diahane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Diana x Me","date":"2014-12-01T18:24:04.371+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> After JoJ was discontinued several years ago, lore focused almost exclusively on champions with \"We're working on it\" excuses making up the majority of non-champion lore work.
