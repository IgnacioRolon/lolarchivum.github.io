I get a lag spike for 126 to 700 area. I have tried everything to fix it (restart router, trying out WTFast network, finding ways to speed up my internet, etc..) but nothing works. And I noticed that it was only for league. Everything is fast in other programs (skype, youtube, twitter.) If anyone knows how to help, please let me know. I&#039;ll be ever so grateful.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-07T16:56:20.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Grandflaw,\n\nThis may be due to Pool Party minions. Have you had lag spikes when playing with the normal minions? As a note, these minions will be leaving when the next patch comes out.","replies":[{"poster":"Grandflaw","date":"2015-07-07T18:32:23.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No. Weird thing is when the Pool Party minions came out I was fine. Until one match I was playing I had those lag spikes. And its the same in every match and every game mode. I have tried everything and I even reinstalled the League of Legends. After the reinstall, I was lag spike free until 30 seconds after the Minions attached each other.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-07T18:50:01.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm.

A friend was watching over my shoulder, and we would notice that things like the enemy LuLu's Pix would show up in the fog of war before my screen would show vision, or I'd get the gold for killing a unit before my spell visually left my character. My favorite instance was mashing the Zhonyas button for about 2 seconds before Zhonyas went off. I closed every other program and still had the issue. This computer has never had issues like that before or since.\n\nI know it's not much to go on, but it might be worth suggesting someone look through for something out of place. It was this game if it helps someone track it down: http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1860061167/42592968?tab=overview","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-07-07T19:05:41.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had the same issue off and on.","replies":[]}]}
