When you encounter things like this, the best option is to report them after the game has ended.  That way we can better track accounts like this and possibly take action.\n\nAdditionally, we also do constant sweep for bot accounts and if we find any, we take action fairly quickly.\n\nI know it sucks not getting immediate justice here, but if it is a bot, we'll get it!","replies":[]}]}
