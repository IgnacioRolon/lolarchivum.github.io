It freezes immediately as the rift shows up and I don't even get to the point where I can see the champions load in the pool.\n\nI have tried deleting the patcher and launcher files and have also tried reinstalling league of legends on the whole.\nOn the computer side I have deleted many programs to free up space on the computer, minimized the programs running when playing league, as well as undoing the windows update (however when I restarted my computer which I had to do at the conclusion of removing the update it just reupdated). \n\nAnyways I was on vacation recently and when I got back both this update and the patch were installed at the same time. I played one game of Poro king that went fine this morning, but after that every game has failed to get past the initial fountain screen (except for one discussed below). \n\nThe first game it happened I just took it as my computer messing up, the second time however after restarting my computer I tried to join the game again and it once again and it immediately froze. I restarted it a third time and tried to reconnect to the same game and it finally ran through the end of the match, though it was already 15 minutes in or so. \n\nI have ran the game multiple times on my computer and it did run earlier in the day (one game prior to this problem) with no issues so I don't see why it would be any kind of graphics card issue or something. I also do not have any freezing troubles on my computer except for the one this topic is about.\n\nAny ideas for help? Thanks\n\nEdit: Also tried run as administrator as that seems to fix many problems but no go. The one game I got through on after 3 times I also set all the graphics to low but this too didnt do anything.","replies":[{"poster":"WilliamY90","date":"2016-09-11T01:17:08.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a similar issue and the Riot gave me a good option that worked for me.  If you have Windows 10 or any windows with the Xbox app, turn off the Xbox Game Bar.   Might sound like it wont help or how it would mess with LoL but it clashes with it for some reason, and it will freeze everything. Before disabling 5/5 custom games froze, After turning it off i havnt froze yet. \n\nHope it helps.","replies":[{"poster":"MotrColt","date":"2016-09-11T02:25:46.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the response!\n\nI don't actually have the xbox app. I uninstalled multiple programs when this problem started hoping it would improve computer performance or something, but I never had the xbox app prior to that anyways.\n\nAnyways I got the game to run in an all bot custom game for about 3 minutes before it crashed. I don't think the fact that it was against bots had anything to do with it as I have had games against bots freeze at the very beginning as well. I am not sure what was different about this game that got it running for 3 minutes or what caused the eventual freezing of my computer after 3 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-11T22:08:23.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Xbox app and the game bar are parts of Windows 10 that cannot be removed.
