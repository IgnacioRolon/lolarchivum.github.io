My ping will be in a good range of 30-40 and then for whatever reason around 10 to 15 minutes in it will jump up to around 200-230 ping. Can any rioter out there help me and explain what's going on and how I can fix this? It has happened in my last 4 games or so and I can not figure out why.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-13T01:44:09.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of the time, latency (ping) changes are caused by issues along your network routing to the server.
