Im being 100% honest but i quit for 2-4 months thinking that my next ban will be 14 even tho i tried to prevent it when i started playing again and in the two months ive played i wasnt toxic and extremely happy about playing the game again. I understand my mistakes and im 100% willing to change and reform. I see now that pain is something i never want again and i will truly reform riot so if you can please tive me one more chance","replies":[]}]}]}
