Personally I regularly clean out my registry using the regedit ms program, but unless you've been doing that for decades and know what to do and not do you would be better off using a free or subscription based registry cleaner program instead since messing with the registry is one of the few things you can do that can turn your pricey computer rig into a useless paperweight. If you think your registry may be the problem then do a search for registry cleaners, but I suggest doing some research before using one since they are not all the same and each will have various pros and cons. I'd go into more detail on the subject but since I've been editing my own registry since the 80s I've never needed to use any of them.\n\nYou are also probably one of the thousands of other people who never defragments their drive and then gets surprised when their programs run into errors or start up slowly. I have lost count of how many people I have ran into in online gaming who complain about their game not running correctly but when I ask them when they last defragged their drive would respond with only silence or a \"What's that?\" response. As this is most likely the culprit in your case I am going to proceed to explain what drive fragmentation is, why it is bad for your programs, and then how to fix it.\n\nThink of drive fragmentation like a cook trying to prepare a meal or a car mechanic trying to restore an old car. If all of the parts needed are all in one place then it is relatively quick work to get the part you're looking for when you need it. If on the other hand you're disorganized with parts all over the room then you have to search all over for that part you need each time you get to the next part. Got that analogy in mind? When you first install a program to your drive it all gets placed in one neat location. But every time you run that program after that, or update it such as what occurs when patching, then your computer loads up an individual file that makes up that program as a whole while leaving the rest in their previous spot, then rather than re-saving it to the same neat location it gets saved somewhere else on your hard drive storage (Note that I am talking about hard drives not SSD). But now your program as a whole has become \"fragmented\" with some pieces in location A and others in location B which causes a delay.\n\nOver time (I've personally worked on family members or neighbors / friends computers and ran into drives that were over 75% fragmented after years of neglect, but one time I let a friend borrow my laptop for just a couple days and when I got it back it was already 2% fragmented) the individual program may have dozens or even thousands of fragmented pieces and in order for your computer to run the file it has to search the entire drive until it finds piece A then start over and search again for piece B, etc. which drastically slows down both the program as a whole, or a specific part of a program such as a launcher that switches you from the main client to the game client. Of course once it finishes loading up it is all in your temporary cache which means that future attempts to call it up will run smoother, but that first call up will be a huge problem, and as soon as you close the program down you'll have lost the temporary cache and need to call it up from all of the various storage spots all over again.\n\nAs you can tell from my description, fragmented files sound like your most likely culprit since it occurred directly after patching and only seems to occur when you first start up the program. So how can you fix it? By default all Windows computers have a disk defragger program. It can be found by going to Accessories > System Tools or simply by searching your computer for \"defrag\". The length of time it takes to defragment your drive will depend on your cpu, your ram, your total hard drive space, your used hard drive space, and exactly how fragmented you have allowed your hard drive to become after months or even years of neglect.\n\nYour first run of the disk defrag program should take anywhere from 5 minutes on a massive rig with little content saved into storage or anywhere up to an hour in extreme cases where you have a massive amount of stored info or a very old computer that experienced a ton of usage in its life without ever being defragged. The good news however, is that once you run it the first time as long as you continue to run it semi regularly it will go much faster in the future even if you have a 200 TB hard drive with over seventy five percent of it in use.\n\nPersonally I suggest running defrag once a day optimally, or at least once a week. Most defrag versions given by default with Windows include an option for automatically scheduling defrag runs. I personally suggest instead keeping it manual since otherwise you may notice a sudden frame drop / long load times or other issues if you happen to be using the computer when the program starts using up your cpu cycles or moving your files around that you are using - and even worse it can cause the program to fail to properly fix the fragments in the case of some versions of the default windows defrag program. I suggest when first turning on your pc for the day simply starting up your defrag program's defragmentation cycle then leave your computer to run while you go make a sandwich or go to the restroom or whatever. When you return you should see a lovely \"Defragmentation complete. Your disk is now 0% fragmented.\" (or whatever your own pc's version of the default defrag program uses as its message) which always makes me happy.\n\nI suspect once you finish defragmenting your drive you will see an instant fixing of this issue. If this was indeed the issue, do me a favor afterward and tell me how badly fragmented your drive was when you first ran it please? I'm always curious to hear exactly how much fragmentation results in specific errors and delay issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Killer3000189","date":"2017-08-16T18:11:10.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i defrag every month or 2 and it hasn't helped Dx","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-16T16:52:56.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your connection might be unstable, I wouldn't be surprised if it degrades to the point of impacting more games in the future.
