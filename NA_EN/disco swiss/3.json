Is more fast more better?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Singed a cool guy.\r\nSingeds normal build is a good mix between being a fast tank, but i wonder if sometimes speed is a better than being a tank thats semi-fast.\r\n\r\nI normally build. Crystal Sceptre>Boots>Rightous Glory>Liandrays>Deadmans Plate>Spirit Visage. W/flash tp\r\nTypical build\r\n\r\nYou can move fast with those items+Singed ult+Drift nd yet sometimes i still cant get to these carries.\r\nE+Flash DO HELP THOUGH, IT DO.\r\nChamps are pretty dang mobile now, you know?  Not to mention the damage in this game, all my MR and armor might aswell be cardboard sometimes.\r\nLets not mention the wall of fecal matter you have to get through to get to the carry.\r\nSo if i wanna go faster than the enemy team can react i was thinking of a build that ops for more MS\r\nIm talking.\r\nBlue smite, Ghost, RG, Deadman plate, ,Shurelya's, Crystal Sceptre, fast boots, Liandray's\r\nPredator, blue runes.\r\n\r\nSinged is still pretty fat with this build with HP and armor. Spells i could potentially dodge right? Unless its some BS point n click cc (Ryze)\r\n\r\nOr is heavy MS garbage on singed?\r\n\r\nMaybe its a situational thing?\r\n\r\nTell me.","replies":[{"poster":"Emperor Talquin","date":"2020-01-06T18:50:27.270+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fast is good, Tanky and fast is better.

His main specialty is proxy farming and then going in when you have the minion wave lead (Not under tower). Adaptive helm is a simple counter to singed though, but many don't really build it anways. If you build crystal scepter and you're top lane, then you have to buy {{item:3151}} after boots and {{item:3027}}  for great mana, ap and hp stats, its just that much better overall. Honestly though, if I got that far I wouldn't care about being faster only because your scepter, w, e, and r revolve around soaking up damage as you pick whoever is out of line for your team. Once you are low health, you pop some ability (not flash or its a dead giveaway) and troll your way onward to dish out as much q and e damage as possible. If you just get 1 champion from the enemy team, you did your job and you're overthinking it. Best of luck to you my dude.","replies":[]},{"poster":"z63XnLCMwX","date":"2020-01-07T07:49:19.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tanky is better.
