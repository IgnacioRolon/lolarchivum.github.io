It even starts to tilt the other players on your team because they just want everyone to shut up and play. \n\nOn the other hand, tilting your opponents is more of a strategy. If they are upset and raging at each other, your team gets an advantage. \n\nSo I wouldn't agree with you it's fun to tilt your own team, but tilting the enemy team is good.","replies":[]}]}
