It sounds like she is shooting a nerf dart though. Have you ever shot a real gun before? It's like **BAM!** not.. _pew_...\r\ngood example {{champion:202}}. Now if i was getting shot at by Jhin i might be actually be atleast a LITTLE concerned cause that sounds like i am getting shot at by a real gun.\r\nBad example{{champion:222}}... All her weapons lack that KABLAM that this character would actually want. Have you heard her minigun? It sounds like she is shooting a spitball out of a straw... Should a minigun sound like that? Her rockets aren't that much better.\r\n\r\n{{champion:104}} He's got a good start, but i noticed something riot forgot about Grave's shotgun blast... The pumping of the shotgun... The best part..\r\n\r\n{{champion:42}} Louder more fluff on his weapons! Sounds like he is shooting marshmallows. The ability that shoots a machine gun that goes **BABMAMBABMABMABMAMBAMBAM** needs to sound like im getting shot at by bullet and not by spitballs\r\n\r\n{{champion:21}} She shooting powder based weapon but no smoke quiet and not scary!\r\n\r\n{{champion:41}} alright i guess. Pistol he uses not a primary weapon so im not worried.\r\n\r\n{{champion:240}}  ^\r\n\r\n{{champion:18}} I think trist is an alright example but she's confusing because her \"handgun\" sounds a lot like a cannon but this weapon is also refered to as a \"hand cannon\" which is also just a **BIG** a pistol but it makes an alright **BAM** and the timer before her bomb explodes gives me anxiety so it cool imo.. Could always be louder...\r\n\r\n{{champion:6}} I wouldn't want to fuck with this guy! But lets be real.. His gun sounds like he's shooting a wet fish... Kinda sounds like Cait's rifle.\r\n\r\nAlso more guns please. Bows and Crossbows are for cowards and people with low self-esteem.\r\n\r\nI want other opinions. Am i wrong? Did i forget something?\r\n\r\nAlso {{champion:523}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:145}} {{champion:236}} **ARE NOT GUNS**! Just posers frauds.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-01-12T09:27:36.967+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, I have shot a real gun before. Have you? The noise they make is so loud that it's a safety hazard. A lot of consumer sound equipment isn't even capable of producing noise at that volume. If media (movies, games, etc.) tried to present it realistically in at least a relative sense by reducing the volume of all other sounds, it would basically be the only thing you'd hear. Volume in media is usually normalized - meaning that a whisper is as loud as gunfire - so that the audience can actually hear what's going on at all times.\n\nNow take a closer look at Graves' shotgun. It has a pump action, and it's a revolver, _and_ it's also a side-by-side. If you check the animation, you'll see that not only does it have parts floating mid-air, but the model also clips through itself during reloading and even while idle. How's that for realism?\n\nFinally, notice how the game is filled with wizards and shit. It's a fantasy setting. Quiet guns and bombs are among the most minor offenders.","replies":[{"poster":"Eternal791","date":"2020-01-13T05:42:24.617+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Realism isn't the point.

It doesn't really matter that we here on earth define gun as something that shoots projectiles propelled by a chemical reactant, in **Runeterra** the definition could include magical weapons that shoot beams of energy and for the sake of simplicity they don't call it magic guns but just guns.\n\nAlso i'm pretty sure In-game Aphelios's first weapon is called \"Calibrum Sniper Rifle\" so it might be a gun with rifling that allows magical bullets to rotate, if it eases your mind.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"HàrrowR","date":"2020-01-13T02:38:29.622+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good sound design is very important, especially for firearms to give them that meaty sound, you can hate Fortnite but damn those sound designs are so damn good, that big sniper rifle literally scares the living shit out of you when you fire it, it sounds like it makes the ground tremble, but on that note the sound does start to be irritating after a while and in a video game like league where you take {{champion:51}} and you're basically auto attacking for 25-40 minutes per game a strong auto sound can start to become very irritating.\n\nI've realized that, even though i love jhin and i love how his gun sounds especially when you kill someone with the 4th auto, it can be irritating during the laning phase where you're just clearing creep waves, play a couple of games with him in a row and you start to notice the sound. That's at least why i think they don't make especially loud gun sounds, imagine if every auto from Cait sounded like a sniper shot from CS GO or Fortnite Heavy sniper, you'd mute the game after 5 minutes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2020-01-12T09:21:38.512+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"More guns would be welcomed by me. \n**But** the thing for me is, they should actually have an unique thematical niche to them.\n\nWe already have quite a bunch of different guns in the game, I think we should just get more if they truly give us something that isn't already there.\n\nExamples:\n\n- Syringe gun (won't fit your \"loud\" requirement, but I want to see one)\n- Submachine guns\n- Grenade launcher\n- Gunblade","replies":[{"poster":"Disco Swiss","date":"2020-01-12T16:53:58.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't mind quiet guns.
