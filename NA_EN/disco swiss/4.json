And that without even taking into account the huge amount of subdivisions:\n\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=938556)\n(not to mention - that topic is from 2011 - and a lot more content was added since then)\n\nAs far i know - there's none. Since the races in League of Legends - kept expanding for the past 10 years - whit new hero additions  (the unique champions - that is - cause they also had to stick to creating champions from same races - for the sake of having a proper lore). That being said.. you're clearly not a fan of fantasy races (since LoL has them in abundance) - more like a fan of specific races. Tho, you seem confused about that as well (your actual expectations), i mean... based on your appraisals... that champion would have to crawl, fly, or move in any other way that's not human - same goes for having hands, eyes, hair and any other features - that humans share in common. The thing is... humans are not archetypes (prime models). Our current form (which you deem as human or humanoid) - is an outcome of billions of years of evolution. If you look around at the animal kingdom - at all the other creatures on this planet (and also creatures from the ancient past - long before humans walked this earth) - \"humans are more like a mix of other creatures - not the other way around (just because monkeys have a lot in common with humans - that doesn't make them \"humanoids\" - more like - we'd be more fitting to be called apes). \n\nThat being said... this topic seems to reflect the stereotypical vegan complaints. For example... a vegan going to a big and famous restaurant - who serves around 150 dishes of which 10% are vegan -  enough to satisfy even presentations vegans (that's 15 dishes), yet... he complains and acts as if he's really sad about the lack of vegan dishes (as if it's just 1 or 2 and he doesn't like those). Same goes here - where there's an abundance of champions of \"all shapes and sizes\" - even aliens and astral begins...  LoL may have a lot of issues (bugs, balance issues - be it unbalanced champion or the broken side of matchmaking and so on...) - but champions and race diversity is clearly not one of them. You can play as a robot, an android, a fish, a bird, an armadillo, a bear, a werewolf, a ghost, a zombie, a dragon,a cockroach, a lizard, an ent, a mermaid, the egyptian god Anubis, a demon, an angel, a golem, a medusa, a scarecrow, some being made of electricity, a freaking alien with tentacles that shoots laser being out of its eyes - and so on and so forth, yet... we have a topic like this.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2020-01-10T23:24:58.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My problem is more about the lack of fantasy race cultures in LoL.\nVoidborns, dragons and Spirits have no real cultures and the cultures of the vastaya, minotaurs, trolls and yordles are barely touched upon and all other \"races\" are transformed humans who live/lived in human cultures.\n\nBesides I don't consider \"transformed humans\" to really add to the list of races. The Medusa, the werewolf,the being made of electricity(which isn't made of lightning, he is made of pure magic), the Anubis, etc. are all humans transformed by magic and the cockroach and the alien are both voidborn, they aren't different races.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Heart of Light","date":"2020-01-09T23:52:45.766+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are pretty cool, but sadly they don't sell.
