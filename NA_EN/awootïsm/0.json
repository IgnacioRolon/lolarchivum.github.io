ARURF stands for All Random Ultra Rapid Fire, a gamemode where you are given a random champion in the same style as ARAM but on summoners rift. During this gamemode, all cooldowns, including those for your champion, summoner spells, and items, have 80% cooldown reduction. \n\nRight now ARURF is on the PBE for some quick testing, which means it will be available on the main client next patch.","replies":[{"poster":"Awootïsm","date":"2017-08-02T23:07:38.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"o Thanks, I saw some videos on ARURF, and it seemed really fun so I would love to play it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-08-02T21:27:15.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ARURF is a rotating game mode, one of those are available each weekend.
