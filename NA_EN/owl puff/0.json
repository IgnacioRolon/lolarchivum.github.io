Any advice would be appreciated.\n\nWell here's your problem.  Confidence is at least two thirds of the top lane experience.  If your opponent senses weakness they will try to capitalize on it.\n\nWhat sort of champions do you play mid lane?  I can make some recommendations to ease you into the lane, but I need to know what you're used to playing first.  Top lane is kind of the wild west of the map, and most things can work there if you're willing to learn.  The problem is so many things work there that every once in a while someone surprises you with something you didn't expect, but that's part of why I like the lane.\n\nI don't know many youtubers and streamers, but if I had to recommend anyone it would be Gbay99.  He's a top laner forged in the fires of seasons 1-3, and it really shows in his style of play.","replies":[{"poster":"Owl Puff","date":"2018-07-16T15:56:35.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My champion pool for mid is Vel'koz, Lux, Annie, Veigar, and Malz.

She has the tools to survive up there, depending on the matchup, and can at least teach you the basics of the lane.  Malz actually has a decent win rate up there, but doesn't have that on demand stun to help keep him safe, so I'd say start with Annie and move into Malz once you feel more comfortable.\n\nSwain, Karthus, and even Heimerdinger are all decent top lane mages right now in case you're interested in any of them.","replies":[{"poster":"Owl Puff","date":"2018-07-16T16:19:57.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been considering trying Swain up top so that's definitely an option.

I just don't want to leave hard and challenging duels my enemy laner would offer. ...until a random jungler comes and gives the enemy first blood.\nBesides that, bruisers shine a lot, tanks are mostly dead, so if you say you're a mid laner you'll have a hard time adapting to top pane because you'll be facing gap closers and all inns a lot more than getting cc combo'd to death. But I guess it's as annoying to deal with bruisers on top lane as dealing with assasins on mid lane? \nIf so, then get used to permabanning Camille and Conqueror (ab)users.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chumpzi11a","date":"2018-07-16T18:39:50.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morg.
