I've browsed the interwebs for solutions and have not found anything that's worked. Just today I first fully repaired the client with no success and then after that I completely uninstalled the game and then reinstalled it to see if it would fix the issue, but still after doing those two things I've not made it any closer to finding a solution. Help please!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-08T23:29:50.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since your client is lagging up so much in champion select, there's a good chance that it's related to some network settings that aren't configured correctly. Let's try going through [**these steps**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) first to hit the most common fixes, but definitely hit me up if that doesn't help too much. Also, make sure to test these changes in a custom or practice game!","replies":[]}]}
