Not totally, because people died here and there, but whatever. \r\nThen...\r\nThe ADC faction attacked.\r\n\r\nOnly the manyrole, master of all four roles, could stop them. ({{champion:78}}) \r\nBut when the world needed her most... she vanished.\r\n\r\nMany patches later, my friends and I discovered the new manyrole, Ezreal. Although his AD are great, it won&#039;t do a whole lot to change a game. He has a lot to try, and learn...\r\n\r\nBut... I believe Ezreal can save the world.\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nOkay, now that I have that HORRIBLE intro out of the way, let&#039;s get to it. Ezreal is a versatile champion, and a whooole lot of people play him attack damage. Well, thing is, that makes his W useless, and his Q, R, an E miss out on damage if you build him...\r\nAP.\r\n\r\nNow, The reason I have no tank items below is because, well, have you SEEN the friggin&#039; damage the ADCs do nowadays?\r\nYeah. Anyways, onto the build.\r\n\r\nSTART:\r\n{{item:1052}} {{item:2003}}, {{item:3340}} \r\n\r\nANY ORDER, ANY ITEM:\r\n{{item:3041}} {{item:3100}}(Get me in your first four items!) Both{{item:3070}}items, {{item:3089}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3115}} {{item:3165}} {{item:3152}} {{item:3158}} \r\n\r\nREASONING:\r\n{{item:3041}}: I dunno, get it if you&#039;re feeling confident or somethin&#039;.\r\n\r\n{{item:3100}}: Q = Spell is cast.\r\nQ applies on-hit effects. &#039;nuff said.\r\n\r\nBOTH{{item:3070}} items: Because they compliment eachother with their passives.\r\nAlways have the {{item:3042}} active on.\r\n\r\n{{item:3089}}: Just a really great item, I love it.\r\n\r\n{{item:3285}}: The PSHEW passive thingie works on anything that&#039;s not your Q, highly recommended.\r\n\r\n{{item:3115}}: Not only does it make your Q have a higher ratio, it makes your basic attacks not useless. Also gives you CDR.\r\n\r\n{{item:3165}}: To top off that CDR. And grevious wounds.\r\n\r\n{{item:3158}} {{item:3152}}: Get these two together if you want max CDR with that nashor&#039;s tooth, and want summa dat spell vamp.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAMEPLAY:\r\nNow, laning phase might be a little difficult, but hear me out. Just poke enemy with Q, and last hit.\r\nThat&#039;s all. ONLY go in for the kill if you know for a fact you can kill.\r\nBe sure to gank, not push tower, if you&#039;re winning lane. And someone nearby is losing lane.\r\nLater game, start roaming for a bit at a time until lategame comes rolling.\r\nThen you&#039;ll roll all their faces into the ground.\r\n\r\nRUNES AND MASTERIES:\r\nRUNES:\r\n.......Look at my runes. LOOK AT THEM!\r\nDO I LOOK LIKE I CARE?!\r\n\r\nMASTERIES:\r\nDeathfire touch, all AP things you can get your hands on, and biscuits.\r\n\r\nOkay, I&#039;m done. Thank you for taking your time to read this... Moderate guide.\r\nI wish all of you good luck. \r\n&#039; &omega; &#039;","replies":[]}
