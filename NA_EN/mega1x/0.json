My graphics are all set on High, and I have Vsync off, problem is when i turn VSYNC on i drop in FPS hard.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if there is anything that can be done?\r\n\r\nI Have already updated my card to its latest update and I still dont know exactly why league frame lags. I have an I7 processor with 8 gigs of ram.\r\n\r\nAny more info you need ill be happy to give out.\r\n\r\nPlease any ideas would help\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd again i apologize if this is the wrong place to post this!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-15T16:40:05.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The driver you have installed may be corrupted or simply malfunctioning, or there could be some issues with your power settings preventing the card from operating to its full capacity.
