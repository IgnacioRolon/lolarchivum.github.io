What happens is that when poppy jungles her page often defaults to the new \"build path\" page with fancy arrows and no smite/jungle items, rather than her default smite/jg page. If you go to the top where it says \"Recommended\", you can switch it to option 1 which should be her smite/jungle build page.\n\nEither way, this is also something that should be fixed!

I think that it shouldn't be too hard to implement to new champion select (where it is known where the player is going) for client to choose mid or support items. I can reply my commonly used items on mid if anyone wants to hear.\n\nSecond, I think that she could have a jungle recommendations too. Because, why not confuse newer players even more if they happen to bring the harmless plant to its home, jungle. :P So, uh, she is pretty easy to jungle after getting second camp down, because the plants can take 6 attacks from monsters before dying. Her ganks are good too: even if the root misses, it will still deal a nice chunk of damage to enemies <3\n\nThird thing, the support recommended items doesn't have {{item:3151}} in there at all! I think it should swap place with {{item:3165}} if you want to keep 3 items per category. {{item:3110}} is second item which I think that I've never bought on Zyra... She's played more as \"an AP mid on botlane\" than \"a real support\" (at least in my hands), so I think that having {{item:3157}} in place of Frozen Heart would make more sense. I think this is more personal thing, but I value {{item:3060}} over {{item:3190}} because it gives AP and splitpush threat.\n\nI'll gladly answer if you have any questions concerning Zyra. I will answer as well as I can from my experience, 85k xp/gold2 at end of season (sorry if I sound arrogant, I couldn't word up that better).
