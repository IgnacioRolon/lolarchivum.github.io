This means a trynd can LITERALLY rely upon luck to kill you as long as he gets a few lucky crits early. \r\n\r\nHis W: A crippling slow that is basically a death sentence for anyone caught out 1v1 with it. The supposed &quot;counterplay&quot; to this is to TURN BACK AROUND to the trynd who has already gapclosed onto you with his E in the HOPES that the frame that he casts it is the same frame that youve turned around. But oh? You thought that the end of this one? He also reduces the AD of everyone in range by FUCKING EIGHTY at max rank. AND ENTIRE ITEMS WORTH OF AD removed because trynds W key is intact.\r\n\r\nHis E: A gapclose. He has a disgusting slow, but now there&#039;s the gapclose to deal with. I would have no problem with this if its CD didnt decrease every time he crits something. So a slow and a low CD gapclose. What does this mean? Infinite vacuum baby. If you don&#039;t have atleast two ways to escape this caveman of a champ you&#039;re out of luck. God forbid you dont have ANY escape tools like an AD or mage.\r\n\r\nand finally his R: Invincibility, a skill that should really only exist on supports, if ANYONE. You outplayed him perfectly even avoiding his gapclose and slow? Too bad, Tryndamere has 5 seconds of inviciblity. You caught him out and are hoping for a pick? Too bad, Tryndamere can use it while CC&#039;d. You just want to save the turret from the caveman thats clubbing all your turrets down? Too bad, youre getting dove if you stay because Tryndamere has R. Oh, and in essence it basically does the EXACT SAME THING levels 1-3 so he doesnt even need to level it\r\n\r\nHis Q is the only thing that I can really say is balanced in his kit because its relatively lackluster in comparison to the rest of his abilities.\r\nPlaying against tryndamere is not fun. Beating trynd in lane and having to babysit him anyways with no chance to kill him because of R/E is not fun","replies":[{"poster":"wolf jade","date":"2019-01-07T18:30:54.916+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":57,"body":"{{item:3047}}","replies":[{"poster":"Sex With Annie","date":"2019-01-07T18:40:02.128+0000","up_votes":59,"down_votes":6,"body":"great! now Instead of getting 3 shot we can (hopefully) only get 4 shot!","replies":[{"poster":"LTK KoRo","date":"2019-01-07T19:19:10.934+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"One pair of boots and suddenly Trynd works like a your main, but melee, cool.","replies":[{"poster":"Lhuhz","date":"2019-01-07T19:25:45.581+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why would Trynda work like {{champion:142}} once you build Tabis against him ?\n\nMe no understands because I checked his opgg and he mains mages, he also plays {{champion:13}} and {{champion:136}}","replies":[{"poster":"LTK KoRo","date":"2019-01-07T19:28:46.521+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"uh oh i got bamboozled","replies":[{"poster":"Lhuhz","date":"2019-01-07T23:01:25.721+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"To be fair, who puts Jhin on his name and then mains mages ???","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2019-01-08T08:06:26.049+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean you can look at the guy's match history right on here and see who he plays...","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2019-01-07T19:23:05.720+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":4,"body":"You take that back.","replies":[{"poster":"Zerenza","date":"2019-01-07T20:28:58.754+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh this ones kind of hard, on one hand we have an insanely hard to kill AP Juggernaut and on the other hand we have an annoyingly obnoxious laner that outscales almost everyone else in the game who's also really hard to kill. \n\nMan, that's a tough call lol Morde would probably look cooler reworked though.","replies":[{"poster":"Saevum","date":"2019-01-08T00:17:24.410+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would vote for shirtless morde visual rework anyday.","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2019-01-08T00:47:09.778+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who needs armour with abs like these?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2019-01-07T22:13:46.031+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"Mordekaiser needs a more comprehensive overhaul.

If he ends up unable to auto you after a spin (either because you stunned him, juked him, or used a mobility spell after he spun) he can't keep up with you unless you forget to avoid his shout.\n\nR: Not invincibility. 5 seconds of \"I can't die\". He can cast it under CC, but it doesn't stop him from being CC'd.

Maybe just personal preference for me, but abilities like this and Cass ult just end up feeling inconsistent in situations other than a duel where both players have perfect ping and ability to read the game. Make it work like Shen Q where it slows everyone nearby if they try to walk away from him, then decrease the slow value. The AD decrease is also kinda weird, but I guess it gives him some utility when behind. Wouldn't cry if it was replaced with something else though.\n\nE: Fair. Champs like Fiora and Camille do the same thing with their sticking tools but far more consistently. It's a lot of mobility but not inescapable.\n\nR: Also fair. Unlike other abilities like Aatrox R, Zil R, Kindred R, it doesn't punish you for attacking him, as the reward is that he will be near death when it runs out. Getting him to 1 HP, then igniting and walking away is sometimes enough to kill him if his Q isn't fully leveled.","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2019-01-09T06:29:27.083+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Passive: I think a big issue with his passive isn't getting crit at high fury, but getting crit at low fury.

If they know that Sweeper lens literally shuts down AP shaco then they win the lane immediately (unless the AP shaco is extremely good at him, although that can be said about any champ). Therefore, AP shaco is only good against people who dont know how one of the games free items you can start with counters him. Does this make him a broken champ? No, it doesent. If you dont like that example, I can use Garen. Garen is a stat check champion, and cant be played in high elo very efficiently most of the time.  However, he can stomp lower elo's if he has the same amount of skill as his opponent. Are you saying that because Garen can do this, he deserves a nerf or a rework? I hope not, because some people like Riste can bring Garen into high elo and do well. No insane mechanics shown, just good game knowledge. But fine, just incase you need another example to prove my point, how about Mordekaiser. This champion is going to get reworked soon, but not because he can do anything like steam roll games in low elo. This champ if played correctly can easily take the team on his back just because he knows that champion. Again, this champion isnt seen much in high elo, excluding the few morde 1 tricks. However, I can give a reason as to why certain champs like Garen and Trynd can dominate in low elo commonly, along with others such as teemo. Low skill champs are easy to play and abuse in low elo simply because the people dont know how to play the game. Should the champ be nerfed or reworked because of that? No, they shouldnt because if you play better they are easily counterable. I can't give many tips because I'm only Gold myself, however I can recognize that its not Trynd thats busted when he gets fed, its that the team isnt playing around to kill him.
