Some say gold+, some say plat+, some say master+. But what I'm wondering is, is there even a way to tell what is high or what is low? I mean, if we're going based on stats, Plat 5+ is the top 8% of players, so isn't that pretty damn high? And for the people who say Master+ is high elo, that means that 99.8% of ranked players are low or mid elo. And if high elo just means above average, then that would mean that Gold would qualify, since its considered above the average rank of players. Is \"high\" or \"low\" elo just a base of opinoin? If so can't a player just say that silver is high elo? If there's no actual way to justify what is and what isnt then why even bother throwing these phrases around.","replies":[{"poster":"Zane Zephyr","date":"2016-10-12T19:27:23.953+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've always assumed it was diamond+, but that's just me.","replies":[{"poster":"paisy","date":"2016-10-12T21:05:14.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-10-12T19:40:21.895+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Here's how most people see it.\n Most who are Bronze/Silver consider Gold+ high elo\n\nGold Consider Plat2+ high elo\n\nPlat thinks everyone is low elo.\n\nDiamond think masters/Challenger is high elo.\n\nMasters has the same thinking as plat.\n\nChallenger thinks everyone else is just low elo.
