Now, I&#039;ve been banned before on other accounts for being toxic, and I was given chat logs for those bans, but a few days ago, I tried to log in and it said I was banned for 14 days. I checked my email and this\r\n\r\nhttps://gyazo.com/24249eb74686daabd8a466b63e1c1b3c\r\n\r\nwas given to me. I read the ToS at least 5 times after this email, and I hadn&#039;t violated any of their rules according to my knowledge. The email is very ambiguous and doesn&#039;t give many details pertaining to my ban. It honestly seems like some automated stuff they randomly send out.\r\n\r\nMy current status of my ticket is this\r\n\r\nhttps://gyazo.com/a08b1e7ef0f77b24d897a029caeb01be\r\n\r\nand as you can see, I requested it on Tuesday, while today is Saturday. I could understand a day or two, but my ban is already 25% done, yet I still haven&#039;t been given any justification for this punishment. I&#039;m posting this in hope that some rioter will see it and tell me why I was banned instead of waiting weeks to finally get an answer from the support team.","replies":[{"poster":"KhaZix Bot","date":"2016-10-15T10:50:08.095+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My immediate suspicion would be the fact that you say you've been banned multiple times before.

Usually when they ban people for 3rd party it's done it waves which usually happens once a month.
