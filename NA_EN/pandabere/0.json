The old art made him look like he was wearing a onesie that FIT him. I can&#039;t believe this went through as the new art for Cottontail Teemo, it&#039;s really disgusting. The art itself is good with the background and all, nice lighting, then there&#039;s teemo himself matching the art, and then the HEAD UGH WHAT THE FIZZ(get it hes cottontail too haha) HAPPENED TO HIS FACE HES SUPPOSED TO BE AN ADORABLE KILLING MACHINE NOT AN UGLY KILLING MACHINE. ALL AM ASKING IS TO FIX THE FACE ON SOMETHING RIOT PLEASE!! THE OLD TEEMO ART WAS PERFECT, I KNOW THAT YOU WANT IT IMPROVED, BUT AT LEAST TAKE THE CRITICISM FROM THE PEOPLE TELLING YOU THAT THIS ART IS SOOOO BAD. FIX HIS HEAD SO IT DOESN&#039;T LOOK LIKE ITS GOING TO RIP THE ONESIE OPEN. Make the head look like the old art. \r\n\r\nTL;DR Fix the head. Art is fine, but the head.. ugh..","replies":[{"poster":"bleufromage","date":"2016-05-16T16:44:56.952+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"he looks stoned","replies":[]},{"poster":"Milky Surprise","date":"2016-05-16T01:41:03.143+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it doesn't look that bad, except the Teemo head.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SlyTactician ","date":"2016-05-16T13:08:53.861+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Funny how many threads related to Cottontail Teemo's updated splash got to the front page; yet, not a single Rioter has said a thing yet.\n\nIt's clear that the splash art isn't  attractive to most players - I've honestly have yet to pick Cottontail Teemo since the splash change due to how unpleasing it looks to the eye. Teemo really  doesn't look like himself here as his face is extremely disfigured. I don't mind the background quality of the splash, but Teemo's face really needs a touch up as he looks more like an old man in a rabbit costume rather than a cutesy yordle. \n\nI'd rather have the original Chinese splash of Cottontail Teemo than this \"update\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pandabere","date":"2016-05-16T01:44:13.713+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/pJMNeRu.jpg New\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/MthL52P.jpg Old","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drulez","date":"2016-05-16T01:42:35.555+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have this skin.
