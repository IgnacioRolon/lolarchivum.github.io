Every single time I try to start one after champion select the League of Legends logo will pop up, the screen will turn black, then it will bugsplat. Direct X is up to date, my drivers are up to date, and windows is up to date. I'm on Windows 10, I've also repaired the client 2 times and I have done a full re-install, I'm stumped.. Please help me figure this out.
