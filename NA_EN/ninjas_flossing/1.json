However because his kit is not suited to prolonged fighting, nor is it suited to taking towers due to a lack of proper damage or armor pen/lethality, he has difficulty closing out games even when hes ahead which allows the more reliable adcs to reach their late game and destroy him.\n\ngames where ezreal wins are more often than not the result of other lanes reaching their critical mass or the presence of an additional marksman or hyper carry on the team. 14.9% of all games have one, even tho hes not good enough to win on his own.\n\n\nSo i ask why do people play ezreal so much?\n\n*Edit* unanimous answer: fun\nin the competitive environment people pick a champ for the fun of it, not to win but because fun... i don't understand the logic","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-02-25T00:08:01.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because he can abuse kleptomancy, and that is fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninjas Flossing","date":"2018-02-25T00:18:14.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so its just because hes fun?","replies":[{"poster":"SuperRiceBoi","date":"2018-02-25T03:27:56.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You seem surprised.

It's very hard to feed on him and very easy to cs, even when losing.\n\nKoreans love him because he's actually very risky in a macro sense. To play him to his full potential you need to turn around and abuse that safety to be extremely aggressive and snowball the midgame. If you don't snowball you get outscaled and lose.","replies":[]},{"poster":"1wolfpack","date":"2018-02-25T01:19:45.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive heard that Koreans love Ezreal, they just love to play this champ come hell or high water.
