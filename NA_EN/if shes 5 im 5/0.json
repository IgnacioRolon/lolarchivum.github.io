I messaged a riot worker 2 weeks ago due to (still playing frequently) and not receiving any honor upgrade over this time. They said my honor levels were affected and that they would then reset the honor levels for me but i would not be able to reach honor level 2 by the end of the season. THIS WAS A 10 GAME CHAT RESTRICTION! This was not a 14 day ban this was not a death threat or anything! It was simply having a bad day 10 months ago a couple drinks in after a rough day at work. I can see people who are serving bans not receiving season rewards but come on a chat restriction for a very minor reason. I had 12 friends in real life who played this with me happily up until the end of season 6 since then only one of them plays because they got sick of riots development team steering it in the wrong direction and being so stubborn. What do you expect happens in Call of duty lobbies/ WOW lobbies EVEN IN DOTA? People wanna be toxic let them. There is a mute button for those who are mature enough to use it and there is those who are immature who want to hear it. Let them choose. If they keep piling onto the rules theres going to be no one playing due to the fact calling someone a troll will get you perma banned. I can honestly say judging by how ive seen not only myself but also all of those who are on my friendslist react to this season, the next one better be fucking amazing or its going to be a ghost town of a game.","replies":[]}
