She has to use her abilities to proc it, all of which rely on her positioning herself on every side of the champ and proccing a vital. If you ever have a vital facing Fiora, you can make it disappear by briefly walking away and then walking back to respawn a different Vital. Her Q is a very short range dash which is good for chasing due to the cooldown reduction, but as I said is short range. Her E is just an attack speed/damage steroid. Her W roots her and lasts several seconds, and if you bait it she has no way to mitigate damage. \n\nEvery single ability except arguably her W has sufficient counterplay, and even her W requires much more thought to using them than Vlad's kit, which is all point and click ranged harass that can't be avoided or counterplayed.\n\nSo no, that's not exactly how Fiora is working at the moment, regardless of how strong she is or isn't at any given time.

I've been thinking about this issue, and had a kit in mind to balance vlad at both ends including his Q.\n\nNew Passive: Blood Bank; A resource bar that fills whenever Vlad steals health from a Unit (Including Spell Vamp, Items, and abilities). As the Blood Bank fills it could increase damage and/or healing, but most importantly when its more than half full, it empowers Vlad's abilities. Blood Bank decreases when  Vlad takes damage. (This causes vlad to think more carefully about his engagements, does he want to build his blood bank to secure more damage/healing and keeping his abilities empowered, or does he steadily trade and diminish his blood bank.)\n\nBase Q should remain largely unchanged except for number tuning, making it a solid last hitting tool with no blood bank, to a dangerous powerful weapon with a full blood bank.  When Q is empowered I like the idea of stealing other stats with health, most balanced would probably be Movement speed, maybe Magic Resist.\n\nBase W again just number tuning, but when empowered is the best place to add mobility to Vlad's Kit. Empowered W could be a short range dash, where vlad pools into the floor, than that pool shoots in target direction, damaging enemies in direction and healing for % of damage done.\n\nE is tricky because (Like Q) it has no decision making or counterplay. If its up and you're in range, use it. Its tricky because Vlad heavily depends on this ability for aoe presence, its how he remains largely relevant in team fights. I think this skill is ok to change as long as it remains AOE. The healing boost can be relocated to the Blood Bank.\n\nR needs to change, and I like the idea of a Blood Curse (Too bad trundle's ult is nearly perfect for Vlad), or Maybe even a Blood Bond with an Ally, sharing stats or mitigating damage by diving damage taken between the two of them.\n\nThe takeaway, i want to keep a single target Q, and a Blood Pool. I would like to add a resource bar that adds depth to Vlad kit (Not Mana)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imfao","date":"2016-01-23T08:38:19.456+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":12,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2016-01-23T11:41:07.126+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Balanced?

Riot please read and comment, I think that these ideas can help your development team a lot! (especially coming from a Vlad fan)\n\n          Vladimir is my FAVORITE champion in League. He feels so cool to play and he feels very unique. Vladimir's identity is in his Q, Pool, and passive. These three abilities feel very important to Vladimir that no other champion can do. Vladimir is known for being the best at sustain, but his Q is not broken or imbalanced right now because I have lost as Vlad many times, and beaten many Vlads. His pool is also very important to his identity because what separates a good vlad player from a great Vlad player is when to pool. Those two abilities synergize because they both heal him. If you were to discard an ability, discard his E, not his Q or W. Vladimir is the only hemomancer that we know about in league, he is distinctly unique simply because of his profession and identity in the lore.\n\n          I believe to rework Vladimir EFFECTIVELY for the game, the community, and for his true fans like myself you need to further define what hemomancy is. Is hemomancy simply manipulating blood? What does it even mean to \"manipulate\" blood...  move blood around, to drink its life force, to shape it, or poison it? Is hemoplague the most powerful technique of hemomancy or is hemomancy capable of greater feats? Are different people's and creatures blood worth more than others? What is the goal of hemomancy? Why does Vladimir run around with a ball of blood, is that where he holds excess life force? If you look at all of these question then it will be easier to rework Vladimir. \n\n          Critically speaking about Vladimir's gameplay, his ultimate, and passive seem less engaging compared to other champions. His ultimate is a point and click AoE that is simple. And his passive feels like extra numbers based on items... which is based on money. His passive should increase Vladimir's power but based on kills and amount of blood siphoned. \n          How does Vladimir siphon blood? His Q and W siphons blood, Vladimir's E stabs enemies with BLOOD BLADES (hemomancy power). You could give Vladimir a BLOOD BLADE ability... that would be cool. His ultimate INFECTS (Hemomancy power) his opponents blood making them VULNERABLE to all attacks and then dealing large damage. \n          What if Vladimir's ultimate was similar to Nunu's, Janna's, Morgana's, Fiddlesticks, or Blitzcrank? He drains the life force of all opponents in an area for a duration while healing himself and procing his passive. This would combine Vladimir's siphoning/healing identity and his AoE identity on an ULTIMATE scale... This would give him an ultimate that flows better with his kit and would feel more ultimate. Also please include his badass blood lord Vladimir laugh when he activates his ultimate this way! Giving Vladimir that awe and power that he deserves! Im getting excited just thinking about it! Picture it... Vladimir's bruatally awesome laugh, he levitates into the air while the blood of his enemies flow into his blood ball! The visual affects would be so cool!\n\n          Blood should be more important to Vladimir in game. Whether it directly impacts his passive instead of bonus health/Ability power (items/money). Or using blood as a unique resource for Vladimir. We know that Vladimir killed his teacher to complete his training and now has all the knowledge of every hemomancer before him. So we know that Vladimir siphoning blood EMPOWERS him. What if Vlad's Q gave him different stats based on whatever he used it on and healing himself. For example... If he siphoned Arhi he would get a little bit of permanent Ability Power that game or if he siphoned Riven he would get a little bit of permanent Attack Damage that game. And if he killed that champion then the permanent boost would be greater... this game mechanic is already used in champions like {{champion:45}} , so why not also Vladimir? This would make Vladimir's gameplay change everygame based on who he lanes against and the enemy team composition... making every single game of League of Legends with him different. But Vladimir's Q can't lose the self healing aspect. \n          This mechanic would be similar to what {{champion:75}} and {{champion:45}} does, but unique to Vladimir because his siphoning is based on the enemy and not himself. This also makes forces Vladimir players to be dynamic and Vladimir's item builds would change game to game. No other champion would be as dynamic as this, making {{champion:8}} even more unique!!!\n\n          Also if Vlad gets behind he is done for... Thus giving him a serious weakness. Or if Vladimir DIES then he loses some stacks from his siphoning? Also this could be a weakness in and of itself... Because if Vlad spreads his siphoning too thin than the rewards wouldn't be as impacting. Forcing the player to be smart about his Q. This would make Vladimir's Q even more of an identifying ability. He would still lack mobility. And base attack damage. \n\n          I think Vladimir's history and lore should be fleshed out more in the upcoming update too. I would like to know what Vladimir has done since returning to Noxus. Has he influenced politics? Rivalries? Friends? What has he done with his powers to influence Runeterra? Who does he like and dislike and why? \n\nAlso I don't like his hair on his classic skin. But his outfit is cool and fits his personality. \n\nI really hope the development team at Riot sees this post, this could help a lot!\n\nMay the rivers run red,\nDoctorPanic","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flowing Heavens","date":"2016-01-24T04:09:47.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PLZ DON'T TAKE VLAD FROM ME!

They are saying Vlad is cancer of top lane.. but all you need to do is build one magic resist item with hp.. and vlad wont be and issue for 90% of top laners. What really happens here is, that people hate, that their wukong, irelia, renekton, riven and so on (all infinetly much stronger in 1v1 than vlad) sometimes fail to all in him and he can heal back...\n\nBut in reality, its all about punishing vlad for it, its same with every champion.. you have to know him and capitalize on his weknesses... He can drain me from 600 range, thay say, its not fair they say.. well, give me wukong(600 dash), irelia(650 range dash), xin(600 dash) and so on, who can 100-0 everyone who dont build specificaly tanky agains them.. .and I ask you, where is balance in that? Why is healing (which doesnt seems to be a problem later in the game for all the ADCs) considered cancerous for majority of top laners, while early assasin potencial of top laners, who then became tanks or bruisers later in the game doesnt seem to be a problem for you?\n\nAlso, big problem for vlad is fact, that he needs so much stats.. because he is low rangemage, he has to have armor, MR, CDR, AP and with all thta also spell vamp do to his E,W life cost (and way to stay alive in close range fight) - this is same what ryze needs, but ryze can build mana items with CDR and armor(frozen H, gauntlet) or hp(roa) which also gives him damage and gains spellvamp from his ult, while vlad needs all these stats to not be blown away in second in TF, and only stat he gets from his kit is bonus hp.. So think about it, before you tell me again, how cancerous Vlad is to the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Intense Salt","date":"2016-01-24T00:57:53.526+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally i allways felt his ultimate had the least impact on his playstyle.

What he needs is some room to be _pun_-ished more heavily for messing up, because currently the only way to really take advantage of him messing up is attacking while his W's Pooldown is up. Or mid-lategame when Tranfusion has virtually no Q-ooldown.\n\nPeople also don't realize how much of a _Crimson_ im_Pact_ his passive really has on him. <1000 bonus hp for building full AP? Yes please.

With this you make room for another possible new champ to fill the role he now softly take. I'm sure there are a lot of people who want to play a pure Vampire champ\n\nBut if your only giving him QoL changes then here are my thoughts:\n\n-If you gonna keep him as a poke mage with low range (aka a hit and run champ) give him more mov.speed (f.e. a temp buff like ahri Q -srly i dunno why you gave that to Ahri instead of Vlad-) or/and make him ABLE TO MOVE while casting like Syndra. I personaly like the second option more.\n-He needs animations upgrades regardless of what you going to do to him. Along with a new, less horrible autoatack. Since all those Q nerfs years ago he is now very AA reliant until he reach lvl 9 (max Q).\n-The model could use a little fix and improvement. In special his hands.\n-The Bloodlord skin (the expensive one) is ugly now with the new graphics of the game, the color scheme is too... bright?. I use Soulstealer more and i thing every Vlad player too\n-Dont make him a Juggernaut, he is not a tank as neither it was Morderkaiser. People STILL dont understand this holy moly. TANKS=resistance stack, more HP dont make you a tank\n-I would like to see him levitate like Syndra o Karthus instead of always running. Maybe like Thresh when he reach certain mov.speed?.
