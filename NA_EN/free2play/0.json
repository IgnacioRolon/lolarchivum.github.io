Is their something in the settings/commands that you can change?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-08T18:05:58.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There could be a potential issue with your config files that's causing this?  Have you made any modifications to it?  We can try resetting it to see if that works:\n\n **Log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nLet me know if that works!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Free2Play","date":"2016-09-08T21:14:56.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a lot!
