So fully stacking cull would take several minutes to actually fully stack up. \n\nThe thing with poacher's knife is, it's kinda designed to be niche as it encourages poaching camps from your enemies. One issue is that it could be difficult to balance. cause if a Jungler starts snowballing, poaching camps is a given. Though for Riot to explore the poaching play style, this works way better than the old poacher's knife from season 5. Simply because once you bought it, it had to be your main focus, and the enemy could easily counter it. (shutting you down for good) \n\nBut with this rendition, the act of poaching is a temporary strat that can give you a boost.
