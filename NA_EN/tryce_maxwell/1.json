It kinda makes me think that Zilean has turned into somewhat of a mini game of &quot;Ah Hah! I hit the adc!&quot; \r\n\r\nThen, the more I think about this change the more I see the changes with ALL support champions that are similar to him. Obviously there are the tanky supports that are prepared to set up engages and all-ins (blitz, thresh, leona, braum, etc) And then there are the Harrassing/Utility  Supports (lulu, zilean, karma, sona, soraka, etc) \r\n\r\nThe harassing supports have all been slowly changing into low damage, minimal CC, mild sustain, meandering ward bots with little to no real impact on the game other than vision. The very few exceptions to this rule are Morgana and maybe lux. Morgana can cheese Q&#039;s all day and as long as one hits you can expect to take a lot of damage. land karma&#039;s ulted Q? nice, but they&#039;ll heal it back","replies":[{"poster":"khorney","date":"2015-03-30T14:19:32.318+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Zil is useless now to be honest. His q never lands 3/4 of the time. So why play him if his q is almost useless in less you already have a team full of a cc move like lux morg mumu sej.

You can toss it over walls w/o vision, check brush with it, toss over baron and dragon pits, and you can place it in an area you *don't* want the enemy to go, kind of how Lux uses her e to zone people. Plus casting e on an enemy makes landing the q's MUCH easier, especially if you e them first, land a q, use w, and if you can't immediatley land your next q, cast another e, then garunteed second q. And you might do like 70 dmg.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"flibitydoo","date":"2015-03-30T16:37:38.025+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"um Zilean's Q hits harder than any other poke support.\n\nA Q+Q combo can easily knock out 50% of their adc's max hp without items midgame. It also clears minion waves very nicely. And this is with practically zero ap.\n\nThe issue I find with Zilean is:\n1. His tiny health pool (at all phases of the game), 2 auto attacks from the adc and Zilean is at 50% hp (apparently this is because he has a revive ult? which I guess I'm not allowed to cast on anyone else that isn't myself because my hp bar is so tiny I die from random aoe in teamfights?)\n2. His mana costs early on. Building tear fixes this, but early game, you can throw about 4 Qs (and no other ability) before going oom. I've shoved adcs out of lane by doing this, but it's pretty  darn annoying because if the adc has any type of sustain (relic shield, soraka), then I all I do is oom myself.\\\n3. His passive is still terrible. Honestly I think they should delete it and remake it. The bonus exp doesn't work very well as botlane champions are all designed to work well without level advantages. and Zilsta Midsta hitting 6 isn't going to make some mad play because at 6, he doesn't gain any offensive ultimate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-03-31T00:33:48.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Increase his Q width.\n\nBoom.\n\nZIlean is now viable.\n\nNo reason to take him over yorick (Yes, I went there)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xelvi","date":"2015-03-30T22:05:40.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're doing it wrong.

In the games i played i was able to sucessfully predict where the mid laner would go so my q would land 85% of the time. i desortyed a katarina and malzahar with ap zilean mid. Just takes skill to land the bombs. I was able to land them so well that i literally had full health most of the time while the enemy mid had almost nothing and their jung could not gank me cause i had wards and my e for speed boots :P","replies":[{"poster":"ButterBladesX","date":"2015-03-30T17:55:40.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also u can use the bombs to zone the enemy and with w u can have two of them out so basically the whole lane is covered in the blast radius","replies":[]}]}]}
