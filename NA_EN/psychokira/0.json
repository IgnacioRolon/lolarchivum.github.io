I already tried using all the options the hextech repair tool gives me without success and i submitted a ticket with files showing my game logs. If anyone has had this issue before please give me any kind of advice. Rip me trying to resolve this before urf ends {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-20T18:42:02.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'll need to get a better idea of where the hiccup is coming from, like a local network issue or even how your ISP is routing to us.

Run it for about 5 minutes, replace the IP address with dashes on the first two rows only, and let me know what you find.","replies":[{"poster":"psychokira","date":"2017-12-20T20:35:47.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|         JUSTINs-iPhone.fios--   32 |  815 |  557 |    0 |  254 | 1203 |  302 |\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting & Cloud Provider","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-20T21:06:44.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This information helps but...holy cow!  Is this the only line?  If so, your phones connection is incredibly high at your home before leaving.  Are you on a phone tether?  Having your data as your network plan is likely the cause of these issues.  A wired connection to a router would be your best bet, though the service provided by your phone might not be stable enough to cover League.","replies":[{"poster":"psychokira","date":"2017-12-20T21:40:49.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|   FIOS_Quantum_Gateway.fios-router.home -    0 |   84 |   84 |    0 |   45 |  488 |    0 |\n|-                                     -------.verizon-gni.net -    0 |   84 |   84 |    0 |   55 |  513 |    1 |\n|                          --------------------.verizon-gni.net -    0 |   84 |   84 |    1 |   55 |  509 |    3 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   16 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   16 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n|               0.ae3.GW11.IAD8.ALTER.NET -    0 |   84 |   84 |    9 |   62 |  517 |   10 |\n|         riotgames-gw.customer.alter.net -    0 |   84 |   84 |    9 |   63 |  518 |    9 |\n|                          104.160.137.35 -    0 |   84 |   84 |    9 |   63 |  515 |    9 |\n|          ae35-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 |   84 |   84 |   21 |   74 |  517 |   21 |\n|                           104.160.131.1 -    0 |   84 |   84 |   22 |   75 |  516 |   22 |\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting & Cloud Provider\n\n\nHere we go i just got a type with the ip address\nThis is the results with the Na riot servers","replies":[]},{"poster":"psychokira","date":"2017-12-20T21:30:16.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just pulled up the app you told me to and put in the ip you gave me, my computer is connected to the 5g network from my router, i have no clue why it says my phone. like i said before i never had severe packet loss issues like this prior to a week and a half ago.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"psychokira","date":"2017-12-20T20:05:36.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What information do you want me to send after doing as you instruct? screenshot?","replies":[]}]}]}
