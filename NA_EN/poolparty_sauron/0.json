While working where I was before, I was just a Production Coordination Assistant with some hand in writing quests. At the same time I was also the resident video editor. Simply put, you can be tasked with things that go with your strengths. I could write and I could edit videos, so there I was.\n\nAt one point,  I had to communicate with the level designer in real-time on the phone, because while I was wriitng the quest and its dialogue, I needed to know exactly a) what was in this scene, b) what can the player actually do and c) was there any other scripted events in the scenario that I had to account for.\n\nNow League is different in that the lore isn't an interactable component of the game. \n\nHowever, here's a simple example - What color should this character's powers be described in? Does it have a special distinctive sound effect? What are its in-game effects?\n\nWhen selling the character's story, they have to match what is seen in the game. To do that they must communicate with the game designers. And the game designers actually have precedence - the color chosen might be because of game mechanics, where they're higher contrast or more visible. The sound effect chosen is because they need to make the character unique amongst  the huge cast and have the ability be instantly recognizable.\n\nThe writing team can contribute flavor text and the like, which then needs to be sent to the VO and their team to determine which lines can be kept, which lines are too long for the given limits of the game and so on. The game programmers on their end, may need to know if certain lines are triggered by specific events (for special interactions), which means they have to coordinate with the VO team to know exactly the audio cut-off lengths to prevent triggers overriding each other.\n\nAnd this doesn't take into account the approval of the creative director or other editors and heads, who need to sign-off on what ultimately is chosen.\n\nFor an interactive medium, no one department stands alone, simply by virtue of what a game is.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"WestTiger","date":"2017-08-04T07:18:45.834+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"A little reality check, no disrespect meant but it's about the difference between writing for yourself, and for an entire organization.\n\nA fanfic writer is their own writer, proofreader, editor, creative director, asset manager, reviewer, and final eye checker, all at once.

An off-hand or inaccurate remark in any written official lore would not only be a mark of low quality in QA, but also have potentially frustrating repercussions down the line if they don't rectify it.\n\nThis is the reality of working and writing for an organization. No one person has full control, even the creative director has to usually answer to the producer, who gets to put their input as well, or collaborates on equal footing with their editor, and so on.
