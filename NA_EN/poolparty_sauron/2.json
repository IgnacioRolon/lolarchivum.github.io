Dragon Knight- a basic recolor but it deserves so much more,so what do we do with it?\r\nSimple,put it in line with the modern Dragonslayer skins or more to be more precise their overall look and feel.\r\nImagine Morde in armor made from dragonbone and steel with a cape made from dragonskin with some fiery effects,I would easily pay 1350 for that\r\n2. Infernal - yet another recolor with the potential for so much more from the name alone\r\nAs the name suggests this skin should be scary looking as in turning Morde into a demon lord or simply strap him into some demonic armor complete with horns,spikes,chains ya know all the usual stuff.\r\n3. Lord - now with this one im a bit confused as it is a reference to Sauron(me) but nothing on this skin indicates that it is\r\nI would say make the reference more obvious as in making you look like movie Sauron\r\n4. Pentakill - honestly not much to be said here but to keep the general look but with a better model\r\n5. King of Clubs - same as Pentakill\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway these are all my ideas and feel free to post your own and i do apologize for any typing or wording problems above\r\nThx for reading {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2017-07-04T21:12:37.260+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is one of the most exciting things about updates in my opinion.

How important is it in your own opinion that Morde have a 520 skin in his catalogue?\n\nIn my eyes, I would see no Problem with replacing a 520 Skin with a higher Tier 975er Skin in General ( even tho I have it, I wouldn´t mind even when not). As I got it, Riot stated that 520 Skins will not be produced anymore, instead we get nice 750 Skins. So the Thing is: the currently cheapest Tier, 750, changes only the model, rarely QoL changes ( Warden naut/Worldbreaker Naut being perfect examples or Constable Trundle), they take the existing vfx animations etc and convey a different Fantasy with only a model Change. Now, what would a 750 Skin have that a 520 doesnt, when all the 750 has is said model Change? I´d wildly guess, the 520 would have to be really just a chroma. \n\nWHICH LEADS ME TO THE POINT...\n520 Skins, in General, for all upcoming reworks, should SERIOUSLY be considered of a Price increase, together with a Quality increase, to at least 750 RP. Another Thing is, SO MANY GREAT THEMATICS...locked away behind a 520 Price tag.\n\nIn this example, let us take Mordekaiser for an example. Infernal, a current 520, would probably have a fiery, demonic thematic that goes perfect with fire effects. Yet, the current Price tag would not justify such changes, sure, you could pull a Tundra hunter ww with it, but the Thing is: TH WW doesnt feel ice-y. Just blue. Quality of the VFX being the key-point here. So if Infernal Mordekaiser should truly convey the Fantasy of an Infernal warlord, he MUST get a Price increase, same for Dragonknight.\n\nAnother example here could be Bilgerat Rumble. While I do know about the Ult VFX, it is still a really Low-Quality Skin. Why, for example, does the Scrap Shield have scrappy- vfx when he got a ship-like Robot? Why not, idk, broken Planks etc? Stuff you´d expect from a pirate ship. And the E, you have this small cannon in the Robot, yet you shoot... the regular taser? I´d expect sth like a electrified grappling hook, would fit the thematic perfectly, another bad Point being the fact that the sparks can actually be seen in Rumbles Cockpit ( or whatever it is), which feels really awkward, as well as the further existence of the exhaust vfx that the Default Skin has ( just look at the flag. why are These VFX still there?). \n\nOf Course this is just my opinion and I honestly do not think you guys would consider it, seeing as you often pointed out your stance on Price changes for example when asked of lowering the Price of Skins like Magnificent TF, Alien invader Dong etc.\nWhile I do think it would be nice for every champ to have 1-2 cheap Skins ( WITHOUT PULLING AN EZREAL) to have sth for the Players that do not want to spend a lot of Money on Skins, a different Point is the Quality of said Skins. What good would a 520 Skin be, where everyone sees the great great potential that just went to waste with it? ( Example being Infernal Morde being remade etc, but not receiving fiery effects, it would be difficult to get another fire themed Skin as the overlap would be there etc) I think you guys should seriously consider upping the Price in cases like this, even if it would be completely new, but at the end, isn´t the Goal of a rework to modernize a champ with vfx sfx VO Skins animations etc.? So if you can bring a Skin to a higher Level, why not go the full way? I dont want you to push every 520 to 975 or 1350. There are a lot of Skins that could be made into 750 Skins. But if you guys see a 520 Skin that could be a really good 975 Skin, why not do it?","replies":[{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2017-07-04T23:40:21.629+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"100% agree!\nGive me more higher tier skins for Morde!","replies":[{"poster":"Kingslayer Riven","date":"2017-07-06T14:05:59.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is, (im pretty sure, correct me if im wrong) none of morde's skins change the look of his abilities, just his model.

A number of champs got VUs now, and those 520RP skins pack way more value in that very little price. I first noticed with Karthus, he got a few very nice skins that would cost 750RP now, but are underpriced. Now with Hextech Galio getting new effects too, that's touching double the value (950RP) than what people pay for. I always pledged to get rid of recolors and count them as chromas, or change the price of the skin if the VU puts it to a higher price tier.\nNow, for a bit more serious and sensible analysis: what would be the pro/cons for a price change? People who already own the skin would have payed it less than what it costs (potentially a lot less, if they got it on sale - i did for emerald taric for example). People who want to buy the skin after the VU just pay the *right* price for it. If you want to give everyone the chance to get the skin with its lower price, you could increase the skins' prices two-four weeks after the release of the update.\nI'm not a big shopper, but I feel a bit guilty in buying a skin for a champ that's underpriced, especially because it's quite arbitrary: the same skin could cost 520 for one champ (if it's a VU) and 750 for another champion.\nThe only downside I see is that people pay more, but is it a downside? They aren't paying more than what the skins are worth, they are paying the right price.\n\nTLDR: I'm all for price adjustment after a rework\n\n\nps: what are you changing to, in core gameplay?

I understand it feels unfair that a Karthus skin that was updated may have more value than another skin at the same tier, but I think we sort of consider that kind of thing a loyalty bonus for players who stuck with old champs until their update. That's just my feeling on it, but you gotta admit Traditional Sejuani became kinda awesome xD\n\nI'm still doing concept art, but for champions! Actually looks like I'll be doing champ up and launch skins too, which suits me because I've been playing since S1 and have a lot of love for the older champs.

I could ask how you as players would feel about that change in price but chances are this crew already have the skin, but if you didn&#x27;t have the skin how would you feel about Riot replacing that 520 with a higher tier version with full fire vfx? How important is it in your own opinion that Morde have a 520 skin in his catalogue?\n\nI'd totally pay more, if the skin has a beatter quality!\nI would love to see, how some skins would be \"upgreaded\" instead of always new skins!","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-07-05T08:25:39.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I fully agree with Valor Bot, and upvoted his comment, for what it's worth.\n\nPrice can change, as long as people who *already* owned the skin get the upgrade without having to pay more, no one should complain too hard about it. If really you feel very generous, maybe make the upgraded skin 520 as a promotional sale for one week after the launch or something, and then increase the price to its new value. But even without that, I'd say go for a badass upgrade, even if you have to increase the price for it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kitty Pix","date":"2017-07-05T03:58:00.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't play Morde, but I know if this was to happen to say... Lulu or Janna (two champions I play and hold dear to me) I wouldn't mind at all because it would mean the skin would come out the end thematically stronger and worth the money anyways. A price increase (especially one so small) assures players there's a quality being upheld and I think it'd be perfect fine to adjust price to uphold that quality with updates!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Malevolent Metal","date":"2017-07-02T22:35:22.643+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd love to one day see a primordial Mordekaiser skin , you know from when he was a warlord and before we became undead.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2017-07-04T21:13:55.867+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lord seems like the most obvious candidate to be made into a lore skin, kind of like Human Ryze which became Young Ryze.","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-07-04T22:12:11.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Lord seems like the most obvious candidate to be made into a lore skin, kind of like Human Ryze which became Young Ryze.\n\nI know this is unrelated, but whoever updated the Warwick and Galio skins is a legend.

Have y'all thought about doing some kind of 'Origins' event? You know, you could re release Young Ryze for a time, so we Ryze mains might get a crack at it, as well as some other 'Young' skins. Maybe pre-zombie Sion? Or Old-Shurima Azir?
