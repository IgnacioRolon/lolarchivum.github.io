Maybe a little reality check of where your roots began and the people that supported this game to make it what it is.  The players.  All in all pretty poor and disappointing effort.","replies":[{"poster":"Diaz84","date":"2018-06-06T13:40:19.720+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"just ran by a bot.the guy dident even have runes.and was just spawning / running in to enemy / spawn / run in to enemy / repeat..im playing north america","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vhan8765","date":"2018-06-06T13:45:38.762+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot never does anything about the botting issue.\nIt's always there, it's always a problem for new players, and it's always brought to Riot's attention, they just never do anything about it.\nAnd why bother? People are still playing their game, giving them tons of money. Why fix a problem that in retrospect only exists because it must mean the game is \"popular\".\n\nRemoving the level cap only made botting worse.\nPeople with hitting level 100 within the first week of the update and then most recently, last I heard someone finally hit level 1,000.\nBullshit if they play that much but Rito isn't going to look into ever and do anything. So long as LC$ is doing its job, Riot won't ever fix their game in any sense.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SinfulStranger","date":"2018-06-08T13:29:18.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a fairly typical inaction by a lot of games that start small and grow as a rapid rate, people forget their roots, but the real issue i would suggest is ever since rito lost control of its own company after selling out to a gaming investment corp this would have become a non issue as it doesn't effect the bottom dollar return. May have seen a different resolution if the company was still run by people that cared about their product instead of a single dollar driven goal, im baffled as to how people can't manage to do both.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2018-06-06T13:51:18.049+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Riot does ban bots, but they do it in waves to try to limit the amount of info that the botters have to get around their sensing capabilities. \n\nIf you have a better idea, I'm sure Riot would love to hear it.
