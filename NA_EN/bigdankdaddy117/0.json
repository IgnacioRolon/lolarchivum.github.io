I was told to do a uninstall and reinstall. I did that and I worked fine for the rest of the day. I got back on today and it doing that same error message again. So then I ran the Hextech Repair Tool, assuming it would replace the missing or corrupted files but no, It told me to go to in the LoL Logs (which I have attached). Is there a solution to this besides having to uninstall and reinstall every time I want to play the game?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-06T22:18:40.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This can happen if your OS or antivirus has changed, so it's blocking game files and not allowing it to install properly.  I can definitely see this being stressful, but our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide should be able to help here.  Once complete, though, you may need to reinstall again to make sure it's all installed properly.

Make sure it's going to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends.
