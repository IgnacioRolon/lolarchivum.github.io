Normally before this started I was always hovering between 39-50 ping and it would never budge outside of that range, but now when I get in a game I automatically start going up and down in ping even on the loading screen. When my ping is low, it's at 29-40 and when its high, it can range from 250 to 300+. Recently, about a week ago, I upgraded my internet because I thought it was from my end. It really helped because prior to the upgrade the range was from 39-18 k +. The ping is never stable it is constantly going up and down, never stops. Many different methods were suggested, but none of them did much for me other than updating all of my drivers, but even then still getting these spikes. The source is unknown I don't know if it's coming from my end, my ISP's end (which is Bell Canada by the way) or on RIOT's end. Help is really appreciated seeing as the game is not playable from the consistent lagging and dying because of losing track of where my character is. Thanks in advance for any help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-27T22:42:58.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your new service is routing your connection to take the long way to our servers.
