This dude has been abused too long, by people just, in general, to get an easy win because they know he's broken. Honestly, Im so sick and tired of yi, he does so much damage, when he has basic abilities. Yeah, yeah, cc counters yi, whatever sure it counters him, but if a yi buys qss or even if it doesn't land what else is there? in the early game, the items that counter him cost so much, thorn mail cost 2900, omen cost the same, what is there to counter him with when he does a shit ton of damage already, without actual damage items. Yi can have one jungle item, which has no damage yet, and slice you up into dust. Dude's being abused by so many people, its insane, starting to think there's no counter to this guy.","replies":[{"poster":"MsNightshade","date":"2019-09-18T20:03:16.351+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate when someone says cc counters them, cc counters everyone...also so many times i tried to cc him and he jumps at me at the same time and evades it, hes broken in every aspect of the game.

His biggest counter is not getting fed. Every single time I see a Yi pop off and every time I've popped off on him, it's because my asshole team/enemy team feeds him 8 kills before 15 minutes. Stop feeding him. Yi completely relies on being able to kill you before you can mount a proper counter attack and he only does that kind of damage when he plays vs feeders.","replies":[]},{"poster":"gabetheguy","date":"2019-07-27T20:21:32.027+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"shut up scrub","replies":[]},{"poster":"Schenix","date":"2019-07-27T18:47:49.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You know what else counters him?\n\nNot having your wave in a way that any jungler in the game can walk up and punish you. Be better than your laner and suddenly Yi is far less an issue, because he just piggybacks on your incompetence; he doesn't make you play anything different, you know the straightforward way he gets kills. \n\nYi remains a byproduct of the meta where you can play scaling champions and be ok in practically every role because almost nobody can bully anyone hard enough to take you out, and those that can are, spoiler, S tier because they're basically the only ones left that still can. If you can lane and scale, why not just go for it. This is controversial to junglers because they can be put behind to being irrelevant very easily, but that Yi is a good fighter means invading him is difficult without proper tracking. \n\nYi thrives right now because the meta is slow. There's a lot of problems to go at other than Yi that would keep him back in line, while making things better.","replies":[{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2019-07-27T18:51:10.723+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Useless Jhin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EZPgVEkA,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2019-07-27T18:47:49.252+0000)\n>\n> You know what else counters him?\n> \n> Not having your wave in a way that any jungler in the game can walk up and punish you.

If you are better than your laner, you know how to manage waves against them, and suddenly Yi can't do a single thing to that laner other than initiate a dive if his own laner is strong. He's left to power farm a nerfed jungle, and rendered marginally less effective unless the game is allowed to go on for a long time. The issue of Yi is based a lot on your skill as a player and the other champions in the meta more so than Yi himself unless there is a power offender like pre-nerf Rageblade or pre-nerf Bloodrazor.\n\nWe still have the secondary issue that most scaling champions are meta again in high elo, which means that bullying, even when performed ideally, is not very effective. So scaling champions like Azir, Corki, Ezreal, Kai'Sa, Gangplank, etc. are allowed to play however they like and still gain rewards because there are very few effective bullies that have evaded nerfs, and those that have generally are banned or are priority picks.\n\nTo add onto that, the bounty system basically renders early bullying riskier to even use. All that time you can spend keeping a champion down can be undone by a single misplay or enemy team rotation. It needs to be toned down pre 20 minutes, and ramp up to reasonable numbers after.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2019-07-27T18:49:09.226+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/2019/05/dev-champion-balance-framework/\n\nThis explains how Riot determines who needs nerfs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor Yi to get nerfed he would either need to\n\n- Drop below 7% ban rate and raise to 54% win rate.\n\nor\n\n- Raise to 52% win rate and raise to 35% ban rate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2019-07-27T13:42:48.118+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"No because he isn't overpowered in Gold and above.\n\nHe's an Iron, Bronze and Silver stomper.","replies":[{"poster":"Jhinfamously","date":"2019-07-27T18:34:54.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uhh isn't his win rate above 50% in Plat+?","replies":[{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2019-07-27T18:40:49.464+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jhinfamously,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EZPgVEkA,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2019-07-27T18:34:54.934+0000)\n>\n> Uhh isn't his win rate above 50% in Plat+?\n\nBeing above 50% doesn't make a champion overpowered.\n\n\nFor Platinum, Riot considers it \"Skilled\" level of play.\n\nTo be deemed overpowered in skilled play the champion has to meet one of the following criterias.\n\n- 54% or higher win rate while being below the average ban rate.\n- 52% win rate or higher while being at 5x the average ban rate.\n\nThe average ban rate is 7%.\n\nMaster Yi in skilled levels of play has a 50.75% win rate with a 14.4% ban rate according to u.gg\n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Jhinfamously","date":"2019-07-27T18:44:55.593+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"No, but a champion that easy to play and \"easy to shut down\" really shouldn't be having that much success in higher levels of play no?","replies":[{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2019-07-27T18:47:33.223+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jhinfamously,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EZPgVEkA,comment-id=0004000000000000,timestamp=2019-07-27T18:44:55.593+0000)\n>\n> No, but a champion that easy to play and \"easy to shut down\" really shouldn't be having that much success in higher levels of play no?\n\n\nRegardless, 50.75% win rate with 2x the average ban rate isn't overpowered.\n\nAll it takes is 1 stun to kill a Yi.","replies":[{"poster":"Jhinfamously","date":"2019-07-27T19:07:31.392+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"All it takes is 1 stun to kill anyone though,  that's kind of irrelevant.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Greenette","date":"2019-07-27T18:02:43.612+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"No Yi player would ever consider building a QSS before their core items which would either be a Rageblade or an IE/Shiv depending on which sort of Yi you're fighting.
