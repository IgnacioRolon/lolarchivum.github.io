So I was thinking league and for w/e reason {{champion:107}}  came to mind. I realized he&#039;s loosely based off of predator and thought what about a Xenomorph type character from the Alien series. So I made a quick mock up and story. The kit I think is solid, prob OP in its current state and I left lots of numbers out like damage ratios and mana cost and base stats. He would be a melee champ so attack range would be 125. I&#039;d imagine his numbers would closey match those of others in his class. (fighter not juggernaut lel) Not sure what role he&#039;d fit in, I think JG would fit the kit best. So anyways here it is, feedback welcome. \r\n\r\nStory/ background:\r\n\r\nXen comes from a lightless planet where brutal savagery wins. After centuries of brutal conflict and infighting a small sect of radicals tried take over the main hierarchy and set a dangerous chain reaction that would ultimately spell doom for their planet.\r\n\r\nXen looked up to the sky as his planet breathes its last breath. Knowing that he can never return to his planet he boards a small shuttle and heads into space into an unknown direction. After a millenia of hibernation he crashes into the shadow isles. \r\n\r\nAwoken from slumber, knowing only fighting and war he seeks to take over Runeterra.\r\n\r\nXen - The Extraterrestrial\r\n\r\npassive &quot;Frontal lobe Membrane&quot; - Xen gains vision of enemies in the fog of war per levels 1/6/11/16 (normal vision levels of 1200 units +100/150/200/250)  - Xen also cannot be blinded\r\n\r\npassive - Acidic blood - When Xen dies his corpse leaves behind an aoe field of acid that damages enemies with a DOT over X seconds. \r\n\r\nQ - Tail Lash (targeted spell) - Xen lashes his tail at his target doing x damage and applying a dot of %hp\r\n\r\nW - Rush -  Xen gets on all fours and gains movement speed, if Xen runs into an enemy he does damage based on movement speed.\r\n\r\nE - Razor sharp claws - for the next x seconds Xen gains AS and bonus damage on AA\r\n\r\nR - Xen jumps on his enemy doing x damage and stuns the target for x seconds and plants an embryo into the enemy, if the enemy dies in x amount seconds the enemies chest explodes and Xen gains control of a another creature of his race. The clones size and stats are based off level (6/11/16) (50%/75%/100%) and last (30/45/60s)","replies":[{"poster":"regonas","date":"2015-08-27T22:27:57.706+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have bad news for you, mate.

Just think of an Aliens Xenomorph I'm pretty sure most people know what they look like.  I think the R is pretty good personally, maybe tone it down or possible change it. But in the movies the face huggers would implant embryo's into their victims and out pops a little alien from the chest... Hmm. Maybe make it so you get a small follower kinda like malz and at different ulti ranks has better stats? \n\nThanks for the feedback and again this was mocked up in like an hour, lol.","replies":[{"poster":"regonas","date":"2015-08-27T22:47:27.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, you see facehuggers and fully grown Xenomorphs are two different being.

much better than what I did. The backstory is meh but its cheesey enough to work. But that kit is definitely much improved. The tail lash passive is pretty slick. Also The W was that the MS scaled with MS if that makes sence, and yea a small stun would work. But good shit man, that's spot on. {{summoner:31}}\n\nEDIT: Also the passive acid damage should only apply to melee. As a ranged champ wouldn't get hit with the splash.

That's why I suggested melee only. Cuz in reality if I'm shooting a Xenomorph from 10 years I'm not gonna get hit with blood splatter.

They use some type of echo location / sensory ability. So they can see where someone is without being seen. I thought I could work that into the kit. The w also plays into that in the fact they can run super fast and in the games they have gotten on all fours to run someone down. \n\nAs for the E I wasn't so sure, they have these sharp claws on their hands and can swipe. I guess it is it like Tiger Stance. \n\nI just tried to keep the kit to what a Xenomorph would do and how he would fit into league. The ulti def needs some tuning I kinda like /u/Regonas's idea.","replies":[]}]}]}
