I tried out the new Shaco in the PBE and there are opportunities to not spend your mana or put your Q on cd, while getting over a wall faster, because of the exploding plants. It can increase your ability to get around the map quickly, and allow for people to sneak around wards without being seen... not sure if I like it or not honestly. I'm guessing being rooted and being displaced in mid-flight will stop you, right?\n\nThe healing plants might be problematic, but they're probably part of how they expect you to sustain yourself without the smite buffs. The vision plants could open up tactical options. I'm not sure what the respawn timers are for the plants so I'm not sure if it will be worth it to use the plants when you happen to be walking by, to rob the enemy of them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-10-26T20:33:16.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only if maokai is able to throw blast cones.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nameless Voice","date":"2016-10-26T20:31:42.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Initial impression, without being able to try them out myself, is that they are a bit of a gimmick.\n\nMost of them, you'll just want to use as soon as you see them, to prevent the other team from using them against you, or to deny the enemy team from using them later.\n\nI'm more concerned about the removal of smite buffs, since I felt those were an interesting decision point to be made.  I'd rather have seen the smite buffs reworked so that all of them were viable during later stages of the game, because deciding whether to smite a buff or to save it for a dragon/baron or PvP smite seems like far more of an interesting decision than the plants will offer.\n\n\nBut that's just theoretical so far.  I can't say for sure until I actually see them in-game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Catastrop","date":"2016-10-26T20:17:50.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate the healing one, the others seem interesting, but that one just seems like a balance issue waiting to happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PureSilvrr","date":"2016-10-26T20:21:56.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Healing plant is definetly an issue\nBlast cone is just pointless, and seems like a stupid gimmick\nand Scryers bloom is basically saying \" put you wards wherever, because there are free ones in the jungle!!\"\nPlz remove all the plants from the jungle","replies":[]},{"poster":"paperbIade","date":"2016-10-26T20:21:32.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"its shit","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zykklon B","date":"2016-10-26T20:17:30.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"WORSE THING EVER","replies":[]}]}
