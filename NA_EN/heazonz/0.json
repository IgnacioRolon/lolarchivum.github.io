For a while now she has been outshined by other junglers who just do everything she does but better. First of all what is rek&rsquo;sai even supposed to be? She is one the worst fighters in the game, unable to dual anyone in her class 1v1. She&rsquo;s a horrible tank because she has little to no cc or utility. She&rsquo;s a bad diver because she&rsquo;s too damn squishy and has virtually no survivability in a fight. You build her tanky and she does no damage to anyone who isn&rsquo;t building full damage. Good luck getting to the enemy marksmen or mage without getting kited into the dirt like the animal you are. Her only mobility spell is a slow mid range dash on a 26 base cd that is very easy to avoid. For some reason her whole kit is basically dps but she does less damage than an equally tanky udyr who can annihilate squishies while still being tankier and harder to kill than rek&rsquo;sai. Hell assassins are harder to kill in a fight. Khazix has a heal, leap with a reset, and two casts of invis. Rek&rsquo;sai has nothing, and her damage is low with 1 single target cc ability and practically no utility. Her passive is honestly garbo. Compare that to red Kayn&rsquo;s passive healing him for a lot in combat plus his ult. He is very hard to kill. He can dive like an idiot and still live for a long time. After her 1 person knock up, which is equivalent to udyr&rsquo;s stun but he can run people down and stun multiple people, she can only contribute to a fight with lack luster dps. She is very combo dependent as well. Once you blow her W+Q+E combo you&rsquo;re damage is out. You are left with nothing but you&rsquo;re regular auto attacks which feel awful. Even when your Q comes back up it feels lackluster. Her only utility and the thing that honestly distinguishes her from everyone else is her tremor sense which is neat but mostly doesn&rsquo;t provide anything for your team to benefit from. It can often not make a difference. So why pick rek&rsquo;sai when you can pick warwick, shyvana, zac, udyr, yi, xin zhao, kha&rsquo;zix, kayn, evelynn, skarner, ivern, sejuani, rammus, etc. Literally all of them are more useful. Rek&rsquo;sai relies heavily on getting ahead and snowballing off of early kills, and even then she still gets out dueled. As a fighter champion she feels very dependent on teammates to be useful. And if you don&rsquo;t get ahead with rek&rsquo;sai, be ready to be almost useless for the rest of the game. She needs some serious tweaking because even though she got reworked not too long ago she is in a pretty meh spot right now. I&rsquo;d hate to see her get swept under the rug and not talked about for a long time because she already received some big changes earlier and because she&rsquo;s simply an unpopular champion.\r\n\r\nTLDR: Rek&rsquo;sai is a poor fighter, diver, and tank. She depends on her team too much to be useful. Every other jungles is either stronger on their own or more useful to their team. She will likely be left alone because there are other champions in need of much larger work but she still needs to be looked at once again.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2018-03-01T20:20:45.665+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Her only utility and the thing that honestly distinguishes her from everyone else is her tremor sense which is neat but mostly doesn’t provide anything for your team to benefit from.\n\nI think this is much less true now that Tracker's is gone.

I'd love to see some more sustain put back into her kit. I honestly would love to see her made viable top again, that was probably the most fun I ever had playing league, but her pro level success as a jungler nerfed that out of existence.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nicorus ","date":"2018-03-01T22:55:36.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bE5AaZri,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-03-01T20:20:45.665+0000)\n>\n> I think this is much less true now that Tracker&#x27;s is gone.

My typical build is cinder, Titanic, deadmans, black cleaver, adaptive helm, boots. I think shes in a good place right now. I may switch to warrior after the cinder nerfs, but I value the added tankyness in team fights, so we'll see. anyway I think shes in a good spot, but I think there are some quality of life improvements that can be made. Awhile back her tremor sense was nerfed, which was completely valid. but its currently in a state where if you're chasing \"prey\" it can be very hard to determine their direction. I think buffing the vision on tremor sense to an increase in tremors sensed for those directly in front of reksia would feel so much more satisfying. If that makes sense? not to where it was originally, but enough so that you can track them while you're hunting them in the jungle. Another quality of life change I would make is the clarity on her E, specifically where are you going to come out? Can I tunnel under this larger piece of terrain? Making the E ability indicator dynamic rather than static, with the \"end\" tunnel where you will actually emerge would be a whole lot less frustrating when trying to tunnel under large parts of the map. \n\nBut anyway, I really enjoy this champ.","replies":[{"poster":"MorganFreemanBot","date":"2018-03-01T23:00:25.452+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nicorus ,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bE5AaZri,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2018-03-01T22:55:36.066+0000)\n>\n> So Rek&#x27;Sia is arguably my favorite jungler, hands down.

It's truly frustrating how you can 'lose' sight of someone directly infront of you by burrowing, which kind of contradicts how she's supposed to work.\n\nThat said, I don't think that E needs a flex indicator. It basically functions like a more generous version of Ezreal's E or Flash. Basically, if you place the 'end point' within a wall, it will relocate to the nearest open ground. This allows you to make some reeaaallllllyyyyyyyy long tunnels, and I think that it having a little bit of trial and error / skill curve is nice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HeazonZ","date":"2018-03-02T05:19:42.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think a good solution for this could be adding a secondary effect to her burrowed q. Something like this: rek’sai gets increased movement speed when moving in the direction of enemy champions currently revealed by prey seeker. That way when you are chasing an enemy in burrowed form, off of just tremors, hitting prey seeker is much more vital to the chase and kinda makes sense thematically. The bonus movement speed you get would also make up for the cast time and missing it, or if the enemy puts in the effort to dodge it, could lead to them getting away which is often the case as of now.","replies":[{"poster":"Nicorus ","date":"2018-03-03T04:54:00.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeazonZ,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bE5AaZri,comment-id=000000010001,timestamp=2018-03-02T05:19:42.888+0000)\n>\n> I think a good solution for this could be adding a secondary effect to her burrowed q.

The problem is that all tremor sense does currently is tell you that someone is there. Its very hard to gauge direction, the space between tremors is 1.5 seconds. Which makes it kinda hard to predict both movement and position to land prey seeker. Adding bonus movement speed onto the Q would add quite a bit of power which Rek'sia really doesn't need.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"xSightlessx","date":"2018-03-02T04:26:22.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ill be honest .
