This happened probably mostly because of this same shiet i stated here and what many other posts have stated as well...Thing is, any of those League streamers now stream it mostly for money not the enjoyment of the game, some are still enjoying it tho. This game gets more broken and unbalanced each patch and matchmaking is broken, yet remains untouched. Riot panickly trying to fix all things but end up turning things more worse..","replies":[{"poster":"NocturnalSheild","date":"2018-03-24T17:56:21.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fortnite is new.
