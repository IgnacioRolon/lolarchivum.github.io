Nothing seems to be working as I'm free for the next few days and I'm afraid I might not be able to play LOL. I've been playing LOL for about 4 years now (left the game a few times for about 7 months over-all) but never had this problem before. And I've switched computers only once and I've been playing it for a year and a half now on this one. I just finished trying updating my windows as a last attempt to fix it but it still didn't work, how can I fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-13T18:56:46.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to hear the issue is still happening.

It’s the official Riot tool to check the game files to make sure they’re all working properly.\n\nFailing that, you may wish to simply completely uninstall League and then reinstall.","replies":[{"poster":"Doctor Spreadem","date":"2017-09-13T18:23:26.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I already reinstalled it, and I think that I need to be able to patch the game in order to use the repair tool since it's asking me to select a file that's not installed yet.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-09-13T18:26:25.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh noes.
