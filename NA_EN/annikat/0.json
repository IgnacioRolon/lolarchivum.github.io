Though I can see on my bank account that there's a payment waiting, which restricts me from using the money that is waiting. \r\nCan someone give some input to this? o.O - Cuz I am lost, and afraid to purchase RP at this very moment, in case of the old \"possibly failed\" transaction will charge my money too.\r\n{{summoner:3}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-09T22:39:36.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes a relog might be needed to show your proper balance.  You may also need to wait for the transaction to finalize as well.  I did look into this for you, and it looks like your RP was received.
