Click OK to close the application\" I went into task manager and was looking to see if there is anything to close that could fix this and it turns out that closing everything related to Razer Synapse lets you play. I do not want to have to go into Task Manager closing all Razer Synapse processes every time I want to play League so would anyone here happen to know a fix. \r\nI am on Windows 7 64bit and use Avast as antivirus if that information is needed.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-01T17:23:10.410+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't heard of Synapse causing issues like this, that's pretty strange.

I didn't update windows or reinstall the game as an administrator because I recently did a clean reinstallation of windows so everything was installed a couple of days ago. I found a post that had a similar issue and when scrolling down, people said Razer Synapse was causing the issue for them as well.
