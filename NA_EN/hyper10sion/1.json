One thing no one could agree on is the placement of these events in regards to one another. My thought is that it goes Shurima&gt;Darkin&gt;Rune War, but I have no evidence to support that other than the terminology used to describe the events. {{champion:75}} and {{champion:58}} were said to be guarding Shurima for centuries prior to its fall, and {{champion:110}} describes Shurima as a wasteland, so I think that event is probably the oldest. He doesn&#039;t recognize Nasus or Renekton&#039;s statues, which he would have if the Darkin war was during Shurima&#039;s peak, as both would have fought against his comrades or even himself. However the Rune War is still remembered and the Darkin War is largely forgotten, so I doubt that the Darkin War would be the more recent of the two, as both were called &quot;Extinction level&quot; events.  \r\nAnyone have any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2017-12-04T21:13:57.447+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fall of Shurima > Darkin War > Rune Wars\n\nProbably like this.
