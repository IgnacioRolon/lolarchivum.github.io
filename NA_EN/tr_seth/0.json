In case you dint know you can watch others replay  but only for that patch. For instance i say  patch to show you but like lets say  you make some very good plays and maybe even a penta  in patch 9.1 aslong if its patch 9.1 you can rewatch the replay but once its patch 9.2. You cant rewatch those from 9.1 Anymore","replies":[{"poster":"TR Seth","date":"2019-01-13T18:43:57.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"watch my latest game if you can and tell me that ı didnt help my team","replies":[{"poster":"World peace plz","date":"2019-01-13T19:15:15.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TR Seth,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=7mk9ViR9,comment-id=0004000000000000,timestamp=2019-01-13T18:43:57.060+0000)\n>\n> watch my latest game if you can and tell me that ı didnt help my team\n\n i am not gonna do that cause of a phew reasons.\n\n\n1. Im a top main to so ik how it feels.\n\n\n2. check my elo on op.gg.\n\n\n3. I was in s7 also stuck in gold for pretty mutch the entire season and wasnt able to get to plat when you check  my op.gg you can see were i ended in the end.\n\n\n\n\n4. i Wasnt able to get out cause of feeders to but ik to get higher i needed to step up my game and get better. I keep a good eye on the patch to see something got nerft of buffed watch some youtubers that can tell how big of a impact the patch has and watching streams. And that if i lost with a champ to mutch i better should look for something els.\n\n\n5. Be harder for yourself if you make a bad play. What i have learn in my climb was that by knowing what i did wrong i could learn of it and avoid the mistake in future games even with no feeders i was a little hard for myself. Things like pushing when my team actually needed me or that i had to be more alert with the mini map seeing if my jungler was going to red/blue or he maybe needed my help befor my enemy top would come help first.\n\n\n\n\n\nedit. i put numbers in it from 1 to 5 but when posted it shows 1 with every reason idk why.\n","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-01-13T17:59:47.617+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You can win with feeders though","replies":[{"poster":"TR Seth","date":"2019-01-13T18:39:37.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://imgur.com/a/ZMuyAgg","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2019-01-13T18:45:27.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What sort of answer are you looking for?
