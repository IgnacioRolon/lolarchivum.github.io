Plus every time I tried re-patching, it starts all over again.

As far as the NA region goes, the installer uses the patching server to grab game files.  You'll want to use the[ official download](https://signup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/signup/redownload) to install League.  Manually transferring or installing files would result in issues like forcing the patcher to reinstall the client every time you launch it, and only save them temporarily.  Hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[]}]}
