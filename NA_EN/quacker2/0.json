So here is one.....\r\n\r\n\r\nMy first skin was Muse Sona{{champion:37}} (975 RP) . I bought this skin on my friends Paypal account way back in late season 2 on my EUW account (me and my friends did EUW since we thought they were the best at the time). To this day, I use it on occasion, but have to admit I could use it more.  I think it is one of the relaxing skins in this game and easily her most elegant one. It reminds me of the climb to 30, which was easily the funnest part of the game that I experienced. \r\n\r\nHow about you guys?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-12-15T21:13:09.157+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Digital Collectors Pack to get Goth Annie. :3 She's still pretty cool, but I don't play Annie much anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kitty Pix","date":"2016-12-16T16:10:11.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The first role I learned was ADC so technically it was Heartseeker {{champion:22}} but I quickly found I hated ADC and moved to support where I got Sweetheart {{champion:37}}, which I absolutely love and I honestly only stopped using because I got DJ.

Funny, it was your first and my last!). \n\nBut I should use Sweetheart more, it's so pretty.

But I loved it back then and I love it now. It goes well with red Hex Core glow and W particles round it up nicely.

Now, with the current Ryze, I typically don't feed as badly and I know what to do, I just don't play him often enough and need more practice.\n\nMy first skin I think was either Surprise Party Fiddlesticks or Super Teemo. I don't use either of them because I don't play either champion anywhere near to as often. I do remember my first pentakill though.
