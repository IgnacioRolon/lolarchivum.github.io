The problem with the ban is i have never been banned before and i feel like it is unfair to give me a 14 day ban before a 7 day ban. Now i&#039;m not receiving my season rewards because i got banned for flaming a troll who was being more toxic than me. On top of that its unfair to ban me for 14 days when ive never been banned before. The banning system should work in steps. 7 days - 14 days - 30 days - perma ban. Also it says that if you were banned for more than 7 days you wont receive the season rewards. So where is my 7 day ban before my 14 day ban. It doesnt make sense to even mention a 7 day ban if no one ever gets one. My friend had 3 acc where he got banned for toxic, feeding, trolling, all of the bans were 14 days. Also it says that if you get banned after August 22 you will not receive rewards. So your telling us getting banned before august 22 is ok but after that you lose rewards because of 1 bad game with a troll duo bot lane? Can someone at riot explain how the banning system works. I&#039;ve never seen a 7 day ban. How does one receive a 7 day ban over a 14 day ban?","replies":[{"poster":"Better Jungler","date":"2017-11-08T08:17:44.068+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/9EVf5ytF-rule-clarification-for-the-punishment-system-in-league-of-legends\n\nThe system is pretty easy to understand.. you just need to read it. \n\nPunishment tiers:\n\n10 game chat restriction\n\n25 game chat restriction\n\n14 Day ban.\n\nPermanent ban.\n\nThere are a few stipulations to this.

There is no tier banning anymore. They have implemented autoban bots, the order it goes in now is like this 10 game chat restriction, 14 day ban, permaban. In that order. Now here's the kicker once you get a 10 game chat restriction it will take you AT LEAST 6 months to get from level 0(dishonored) to level 2 which is honorable enough to start receiving rewards again. But it gets even better, because in those 6 months you have to be HONORED enough to get to level 2, unlike everyone else who automatically gets honor just for playing a little at time you have lost that ability until you accrued enough honor from other people to get to level 2. So once you get a strike against you it's much easier just to start a new account, and under no circumstance give this company any real money for skins or RP, they are nothing but money grubbing crooks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2017-11-11T09:56:11.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I got for 14 days for flaming a toxic troll adc ahri who built ap and fed\n\nThis is one hell of a start","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oh Shiro","date":"2017-11-08T10:21:47.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anyway thankyou for telling me how the system works...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-11-08T08:17:08.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"7 day bans are not a thing, the system works in tiers, it goes :\n10 game chat restriction\n25 game chat restriction\n14 day suspension\nPermanent suspension\n\nHowever, certain zero tolerance behaviirs such as hate speech, racism, or encouraging self harm will skip tiers.\n\nI am not sure where you heard about 7 day suspensions, if you have a link to where you saw it I would like to give it a read.","replies":[]},{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2017-11-08T08:15:33.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"7 days ban doesn't exist.
