Some games, you either play \"perfect\" and still lose, or you play well enough to the point that your mistakes didn't cost you the game, but it was what your team did. For example: I'm Sivir, farming it out bot lane. No real advantage I can gain. I'm at 80 cs vs 65 cs on the enemy at 10 minutes, which is a pretty good lead early on, and I've taken half of the enemy tower. I can say I'm doing well for myself, right? Sure, maybe there could b e opportunities where I could have punished the enemy more, denied more cs, maybe even kill the enemy, but I gained an advantage and I didn't give anything to the enemy. At the same time, my Yasuo top is 0/7/0 vs Nasus who is 6/0 something, already having 150 stacks at 10 minutes. I can't really leave bot lane to try and hold Nasus back with a rotation, because then my tower at bot lane falls, and the enemy bot lane gets a free pass to get back in the game and even get stronger than me, while I'm stuck trying to contain the Nasus.\n\nAt the end of the day, I played a game where I was either \"perfect\" or I was good enough that any mistakes didn't really cost me the defeat. At this stage, the only thing I can do is blame my Yasuo for losing me the game. I can definitely check back my own game after, see what I could have done better, but even if I didn't miss a single cs for example, there was basically nothing I could do to stop Nasus. Eventually, Nasus would just bm us outside of our fountain, we couldn't go out because we would die, and he had Frozen Heart, Iceborn Gauntlet and Thornmail with Ninja Tabi, so I was doing negative damage.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2018-04-20T14:06:21.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> At this stage, the only thing I can do is blame my Yasuo for losing me the game.\n\nAt this stage, the best thing you can do is shut your mouth.

And if by chance that game was only 95% lost but not 100%, you're just making sure that now it's certain it's lost.\n\nYou gain NOTHING by blaming Yasuo. Not a single damn thing. However small the price it costs you to blame him, it's not worth it, because it's higher than Zero. So shut your mouth and play.
