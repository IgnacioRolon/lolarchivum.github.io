I have no idea what it is, i have checked my internet router inside their web interface, I prioritized my computer, I even made sure no one is using the internet while I play but nothing really seems to help. I tried using my cellphone internet (hotspot) but my ping goes even higher, now on NA with the hotspot is about 245ms and on LAN server goes up to about 145ms.\n\n>It really sucks to not be able to play league anymore because of the recent ping raise, I hope somehow the servers will get fixed again but I'm not sure if it's my internet since it used to be quite lower and suddenly today it went up even higher.\n\n>Please let me know if you find a solution to it, I'm having a hard time playing League like this.\n\n>Thanks a lot, Sincerely\n\nI received this message back.\n\n>Hey there **********,\n\n>******* has appeared! .^\n\n>As you are well aware, the sheer distance you are trying to connect from will cause lag issues. You will have a lot of different nodes you will have to jump through before you will get to our servers and a problem with any single one could greatly increase your ping. However, if you wanna look into your actual route to see where exactly you might be running into some ping issues, I have a tool you can use!\n\n>This will give us a closer look at the route your connection takes to our servers. Just follow this link to provide me with a Network Analysis (Try other browsers if they do not work on your default) and a Tracert, which you can log using WinMTR, so we can see what your packets are doing en route to the server. Make sure to run WinMTR while you're running a custom game!:\n\n>Download WinMTR\n\n>Select the correct download then Run WinMTR. In the Host field, please enter in the one of the following address for the server you're currently playing on and click Start.\n\n>NA Server: 192.64.170.252 and 104.160.131.1 and google.com\n\n>For each test, run it for five minutes, press the STOP button, export to text, and attach it to your reply.\n\n>If you have any more questions, information, or concerns, please feel free to message me again and I will help you the best I can!\nRiot Games Player Support\n\nNow I am on a mac so I tried doing what he said but I am getting all this errors.\n\nThis is what I get on the netalyzr site I cant even start the analyzer there is not button: http://imgur.com/a/pcAaI\n\nAnd LOLmtr I get this problems. http://imgur.com/a/6QSwy http://imgur.com/a/WoLFO\n\nCan anyone help me please?\n\nPosting this here since I need a solution asap if anyone could help me out.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-27T02:33:27.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry Kawaii Zubat hasn't replied to your ticket yet. I'm not entirely sure if WinMTR will work very well on a Mac, and I would suggest using something like [**Nmap**](http://alternativeto.net/software/nmap/) to do a traceroute on a MacOS. Honestly, your best bet might be to wait on that zubat's response though.","replies":[]}]}
