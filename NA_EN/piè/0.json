Trust me, its fail safe:\n\nStep 1: Mute all at the beginning of the game. Don't type anything, don't tell them they're muted, just mute all. Nobody is required to type. There's a ping for everything needed to communicate.\n\nStep 2: Unbind your Return key in the settings. Actually you only have to do step 2 once, because once it's unbound, it remains unbound, but that also means you can't open the chat window to type, and will not have the chance to be toxic. \n\nYou're welcome.","replies":[{"poster":"Karunamon","date":"2017-11-10T00:30:29.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IIRC, the enter key doesn't have a bind.

If you get any punishment whatsoever after coming off the 2 week ban, it'll be a permanent. If I were you, I'd be very wary of chatting at all. Don't trash talk, don't try to be funny, don't complain, just play the game. Don't put a single word in the chatbox unless it's unambiguously positive.","replies":[{"poster":"Piè","date":"2017-11-09T01:13:04.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok ty","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Piè","date":"2017-11-09T00:58:51.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks guys! ill try to do everything you said and see if it helps","replies":[]},{"poster":"swanington","date":"2017-11-08T21:14:37.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Read the Tao Te Ching","replies":[]},{"poster":"Karunamon","date":"2017-11-08T21:11:25.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have a hard time with spur of the moment raging into the chat box, I'd suggest a tool to disable your enter key in game.\n\nInstructions here: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/ghKQoeu8-how-to-unbind-your-enter-key-to-prevent-inadvertent-toxicity","replies":[]},{"poster":"DU Baymax","date":"2017-11-08T20:53:39.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"/muteall","replies":[]},{"poster":"DaenrysTargaryen","date":"2017-11-08T20:50:45.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have never been toxic in game or out of game but when i first started playing i was rude, but what i did was just said whatever i was going to say by talking out loud, like last game i played there was a player who made a dumb decision, i said Dumb ass Talking but not typing it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-11-08T20:47:07.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. gain some self control.\n2. just mute everyone and play\n3. at some point you actually will have to realize its just a game and what people say don't mean anything unless you let it.\n4. take an anger class?\n5. take a break for a couple hours or however long","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2017-11-08T20:46:19.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Realize that insulting people solves nothing and realize that most people playing poorly aren't feeding on purpose, we just all have bad games.","replies":[]}]}
