This wasn&#039;t a ragequit, I wasn&#039;t inting, I wasn&#039;t afk. During two ranked games, my game has suddenly crashed, then when I try to reconnect I get a direct x error message and need to restart my PC entirely to reconnect, and by that point, the game is usually already over. I also occasionally have games in which this will happen in the loading screen, and that&#039;s how the errors started out. As of yesterday and today, my game has crashed twice, mid-game, in which im also quite positive is a result of the game itself, not my computer. Everything else was running fine, my discord call, even the league client voice chat was still working, yet my screen was frozen, and an error message on another tab was showing while I was holding alt-tab (however I couldn&#039;t actually alt-tab out of the game). I&#039;ve tried fixing the direct x error through the client repair tool, I tried deleting some of the client folders and then using the repair tool (as this was the suggestion after a google search), I also tried completely reinstalling the game, nothing evidently worked as the most recent game I had, it has crashed again. Fortunately I was able to restart my PC fast enough and reconnect, however by this point I was well too far behind and the game was lost, I again received queue bans for leaving this game, even after reconnecting and playing it out to the end. Obviously it is an automated system that gives out the queue bans, but im posting this here because I am of the belief that they are quite unfair.\r\n\r\nMy in game name is Neon Gravestones, some advice on how I can try to fix these crashes or some feedback about my queue bans would be much appreciated. \r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-12T03:42:48.484+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"At a point the system has to consider the impact you are having on other players, even if the leaves aren't intentional. This is especially true in ranked. YOu are clearly aware of the issue, and yet started a ranked game anyway? You aren't the only one impacted by your disconnects, nor are you the majority affected, and that consideration plays a role.\n\nRegarding your client drama, it sounds like something is up with your DirectX install, especially if repairs and reinstall of the League client didn't resolve the issue.\n\nI'd recommend updating your DirectX: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes#wq3\n\nYou can also try any of the other steps in that support article that you haven't already. Failing that I'd recommend submitting a ticket to player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[{"poster":"Neon Gravestones","date":"2018-11-12T13:07:17.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh I completely reinstalled the game between the two ranked games, it had been suggested I reinstall the client by a friend who'd had a similar experience, evidently that didn't work.\n\nMy DirectX is up to date also, so I'll try sending through a ticket.\n\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-13T01:20:47.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm if an uninstall and DirectX fixes haven't worked that's rather beyond my knowledge (tech just really isn't my area). LeaverBuster is harsher in ranked games so I'd probably recommend avoiding those (if you aren't already) until you've got stability back.\n\nSorry I couldn't help you more, hopefully support can get things fixed up for you quickly.","replies":[{"poster":"Hi Im Stanky","date":"2018-11-15T00:20:54.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a bugg, its been happening since 8.21 and is affecting a decent amount of people, myself included. Here is a link to one of the other board posts detailing the same stuff.\n\n https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/Wd0qW4K1-game-crashing-and-freezing?comment=00000000\n\nI've patched multiple times and hextech repaired almost every day. Experienced this in ARAM as well as in bot matches of all things, since now that's what I'm reduced to. Sent tickets away and gotten the exact same \"deal with it response\" from riot coupled with issues simply trying to file the tickets (not being able to upload lol logs). Witnessing a decent number of people on my friends list all going through the exact same list of issues since 8.21, which by the way is now over 3 weeks ago!\n\nSo please, riot if you're reading this. We're trying to help you see what's going on here so you realize and can do something to fix it. I've got RDD2 in the meantime, message me back here when it's fixed\n\nMuch love Stanky xoxo","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nasus Bot","date":"2018-11-13T00:45:52.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you experience it in game or at loading  screen or once you enter the game?  I've had directx errors only when I've installed league when I'm bypassing administrater. Is that what you're doing? If it's not, have you tried running the game as administrator? hop into practice tool and wait to see if there's any directx error.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neon Gravestones","date":"2018-11-12T02:34:09.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"C:\\Users\\baile\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\PKM2427.tmp\n\nThis is the dump file or whatever\nTried to play a normal game with a friend just now and again I've crashed in the middle of the game, for seemingly no fuckin reason, I'm not getting any message other than a direct x error, which I have tried what feels like everything to fix. A message came up to create a dump file or something along those lines and gave me this link to send as an error report. I like the game, but this shit is frustrating me, luckily Spyro comes out tomorrow so I dont have to sit through this shit and can play a game that actually works. \n\nIf anyone knows, or can try to help me fix the game, I'm all ears.
