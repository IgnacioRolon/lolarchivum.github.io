As a support main/support player, it&#039;s often difficult to work with an ADC whose head isn&#039;t in the game because their mechanics are not up to scratch or their decision making isn&#039;t on par with the opponents/other laners or they just don&#039;t play ADC.\r\nI am here in hopes of finding an ADC that synergies well with me, follows my lead and tells me what they want me to do when needed(but should be self explanatory). \r\nThe main champions I play for support is;\r\n1. Braum\r\n2. Leona\r\n3. Alistar\r\nThe champions I can play for support is:\r\n1. Trundle\r\n2. Morgana\r\n3. Janna\r\n4. Shen\r\nThe champions I am currently saving up for (support):\r\n1. Thresh\r\n2. Nami\r\n3. Lulu\r\n\r\nA prospective ADC main would be an ADC who can mechanically play adc&#039;s (kiting/smart ability decision making) and plays adc&#039;s such as Vayne/Kalista/Draven/Jinx/Lucian/Tristana/Ashe/Anyone but ezreal unless you play ezreal to a main level.\r\nIf you are interested in having a support who would be up for playing with you during ranked duo queue, add me in game and or leave a comment below. :)","replies":[]}
