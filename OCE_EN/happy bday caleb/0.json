I would say i have a pretty good knowledge of the game for example champs, items etc.. i also feel i am decent when it comes to mechanics in game such dodging, landing skill shots so on. I do however believe i could improve on my decision making in games sometimes ill end up dead and think what the hell was i thinking, as well as having games were i have barely average to not so good Cs. I am willing to play either ADC or jungle though i feel my adc might be a little bit stronger depending which champs you guys want me to play.
