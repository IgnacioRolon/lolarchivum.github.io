The more you stay still, the more she can pour tons of damage into you, thus the main counter against Illaoi is to move.\n\nGnar is excellent at doing that. His movespeed and small hitbox makes him a mobile threat against Illaoi.\n\nHowever, when Gnar enters Mega Gnar, he becomes slower, making him an easier target for Illaoi. When Illaoi uses Test of Spirit against the large and slow Mega Gnar she pulls out a Mini-Gnar instead! This gives Gnar an unfair disadvantage against Illaoi, since Illaoi can easily hit Mega-Gnar with Test of Spirit and start whacking away at a squishy Mini-Gnar spirit.\n\n\nI don&#039;t know if this is a glitch or not, but nonetheless it shouldn&#039;t go unnoticed.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-05-21T08:41:40.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But her w does % max hp, if it pulls out mini gnar you take less damage anyway, considering they buffed gnar to have same hp regen and resists in mini and mega anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Shockal","date":"2017-05-21T13:41:52.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you sure -.-\n\nWelp, alright then.
