While I do not make excuses for my negative and toxic behaviour and I agree it was a deserved ban, I'm currently undergoing therapy for anger management issues outside and inside of League. I believe that given time I can improve myself to become a better person inside the League of Legends community and as a whole.\r\n\r\nI would like to apologise to the players in my games that I have flamed or have witnessed me flame. My actions and behaviour are inexcusable, and I deeply regret my toxic and negative behaviour.\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nDawnlight: enjoy the mute buddy\r\nDawnlight: Yi you degenerate fuckwit\r\nDawnlight: dont fucking talk to me\r\nDawnlight: you braindead kike\r\nDawnlight: It's not Ivern's fault\r\nDawnlight: we're in a trio with mid\r\nDawnlight: you're playing master yi\r\nDawnlight: I could literally close my eyes and play yi better than you\r\nDawnlight: yes play draven with your eyes closed I dare youy\r\nDawnlight: fuck off %%%%\r\nDawnlight: you're braindead\r\nDawnlight: dont even fucking talk to me\r\nDawnlight: kill yourself\r\nDawnlight: you think I care\r\nDawnlight: who hasnt ff'd\r\nDawnlight: your parents should have kicked you as a babay\r\n\r\nGame 2\r\nIn-Game\r\nDawnlight: THe last tick of fucking ignite and twitch poison\r\nDawnlight: nice\r\nDawnlight: gj\r\nDawnlight: xd\r\nDawnlight: my fucking frames\r\nDawnlight: what\r\nDawnlight: my frames were at 7 that whole time\r\nDawnlight: why ping '\r\nDawnlight: there was nothing I could do\r\nDawnlight: Thresh is such a braindead bullshit fucking retarded champion\r\n\r\nGame 3\r\nIn-Game\r\nDawnlight: your\r\nDawnlight: you're a fucking %%%%\r\nDawnlight: I was ulting\r\nDawnlight: stop living\r\nDawnlight: kill yourself\r\nDawnlight: you're human filth\r\nDawnlight: you think I care\r\nDawnlight: Riot can ban me all they want\r\nDawnlight: why rip me\r\nDawnlight: you think I care if I get banned or not?\r\nDawnlight: Sorry about your life %%%%, I'm sure your parents are very proud of the degenerate they raised\r\nDawnlight: I'll have you know\r\nDawnlight: I'm 6'4\r\nDawnlight: And I row for UC Davis\r\nDawnlight: nobody got the... meme?\r\nDawnlight: damn ok\r\nDawnlight: Sithposting would be the Darth Plagueis copypasta\r\nDawnlight: UC Davis thing is a Dom meme from like a year or two ago\r\nDawnlight: no the meme is from IWillDominate's stream\r\nDawnlight: I wanted my birdie ;-;\r\nDawnlight: Why are you so rude kitty\r\nDawnlight: I must be the fast\r\nDawnlight: Rengar that was personal and rude\r\nDawnlight: I am offended\r\nDawnlight: zoooooom\r\nDawnlight: *chins\r\nDawnlight: your point?\r\nPost-Game\r\nDawnlight: Im not fat tho\r\nDawnlight: ree","replies":[{"poster":"TF Blade","date":"2019-03-12T20:42:22.606+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello?\n\n> Dawnlight: kill yourself\nDawnlight: you're human filth\nDawnlight: you think I care\nDawnlight: Riot can ban me all they want\n\n>Dawnlight: Yi you degenerate fuckwit\nDawnlight: dont fucking talk to me\nDawnlight: you braindead kike\n\n>Dawnlight: kill yourself\nDawnlight: you think I care\nDawnlight: who hasnt ff'd\nDawnlight: your parents should have kicked you as a babay\n\n\"Riot can ban me all they want\"\nGets banned\n*surprised pikachu face*","replies":[]},{"poster":"rand56432","date":"2019-03-12T16:30:14.397+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"are yo serious??

The most likely case is that it's included because it was reported, and occurred between two games that actually triggered punishment. Tbh, nothing more than that game 1 should have really been necessary.\n\nPoint being that if a game is reported and flagged around the time of punishment it seems to often be included, even if it wouldn't necessarily contribute to punishment itself.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-03-12T02:19:01.326+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Dawnlight,\n\nIt's great that you're making efforts to deal with your outbursts and give yourself better self-control over your actions, you're already doing more than most players in your situation. Always good to see someone taking responsibility, and trying to improve themselves.\n\nUnfortunately, Riot has a pretty strict policy regarding punishments. The *only* time they will remove a ban is if the punishment was issued in error, such as when a punishment *shouldn't* have been issued, or when a less severe punishment was warranted. Looking through the chat logs, it becomes fairly obvious why your behaviour warranted a punishment (and I'm sure you already know which parts are problematic, but if you'd like someone to go through it in detail with you just feel free to ask).\n\nPerhaps the only way you *might* (and I *really* want to stress that \"might\") get a reduced sentence is if you didn't follow the \"standard\" punishment progression, which is usually chat restrictions (10-game into 25-game) then bans (14-day into permanent). It's important to note that certain \"no tolerance\" behaviours (such as suicide encouragement, homophobia and racism) can result in escalations past chat restrictions, so it's entirely possible you would have only received the bans if the provided logs are anything to go by. You can definitely feel free to submit a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"Account suspensions or restrictions\" option) and discuss the situation with them, but I honestly doubt they'll be able to do anything in this case.\n\nIf you have any more questions, or need any more assistance, feel free to ask.","replies":[]}]}
