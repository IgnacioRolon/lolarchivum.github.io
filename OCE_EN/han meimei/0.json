I love my hometown, and I love League of Legends as well.\r\n\r\nHowever, I won&rsquo;t talk League of Legends today, I will talk to you guys that a unique culture in Chinese E-Sports community: Dunai, you can take it as a kind of CURSED BLESSING if you like.\r\nOn Weibo, which is Chinese Twitter, there is a man named Xudong Huang, he always give his blessings to a lot of e-sports players, just like what Priest and Saint Knight did before. Though it seems like a good thing, the blessed players always reject his blessing. Why? Because they always get failed after Huang blessed them. Hence he got a nickname: Dunai (a cursed blessing sender).\r\n\r\n http://i66.tinypic.com/2howpqb.png[/IMG]\r\nThe Man Who Changed Match: Xudong Huang&rsquo;s Biography\r\nPicture/@ DUNAI SE( Xudong Huang&rsquo;s Weibo)\r\n\r\nThe most famous achievement Xudong Huang made was the National Cup of StartCraft II in 2016. He &ldquo;blessed&rdquo; Team Korea will defeat Team France with a score of 5:0. To some extent, it was 5:0 indeed, but the difference was, Team France 5:0 Team Korea.\r\n\r\nDue to this, all teams in China ask Xudong Huang &ldquo;not to bless&rdquo; before tournaments.\r\n\r\n http://i63.tinypic.com/2dgkwe8.png[/IMG]\r\nXudong Huang&rsquo;s ID on Weibo: Dunai Se（毒奶色）\r\n（The content he released just before The Worlds Quarterfinal between Team WE and Team Cloud9）\r\nHe wrote: The director of Team WE Erji Xia told me that Team C9 is too strong to defeat, then he gave me a red packet (money inside) secretly, I was very happy and went home. But when I was home and open the pocket, it was just 88 Yuan (less than USD 15) inside, WTF.\r\n\r\nBesides Xudong Huang, there is another person in China who is also good at Dunai, and his name is Joker. Before Team Longzhu and SSG fight against each other in quarterfinals, he wrote on his Weibo:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://i68.tinypic.com/smt8uc.png[/IMG]\r\nJoker&rsquo;s ID on Weibo: Joker874\r\n&ldquo;It will be an easy match for Longzhu today, because I saw Ambition (Jungle for SSG) has bought a flight back to Korea from Guangzhou at 8:30.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nhttp://i65.tinypic.com/2465je9.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nPerhaps it effected Team Longzhu eventually, almost everyone knows how strong Longzhu was, they were even considered as a champion candidate. However, they messed them up and get defeated three times by SSG. In such a BO5 matchup, they got 0-3 at the end and be thrown out from the Worlds.\r\n\r\nIt is similar to the &ldquo;Curse of Artosis&rdquo;, but what the difference is, Dunai appears as a blessing rather that curse.\r\nDunai becomes more and more popular in China now, someone even discuss the reasonable factors of Dunai on Zhihu (Quora-like in China), it makes fans of a team always give their blessings to the opponent. I think it is friendly and what&rsquo;s more, it seems workable as well.\r\nI wonder if Dunai will be a trend around the world as well?\r\n\r\nThough I am very sad for Chinese teams who are eliminated from the Worlds Final, I don&rsquo;t think their defeat are associated with Dunai.\r\n\r\nBut it is just the charm of E-Sports. I welcome you guys to China and wish we have a better and better E-Sports circumstance across the world as well. By the way, it is a blessing from the bottom of my heart, not Dunai at all. :D","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-11-02T08:20:45.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe he can \"dunai: SK Telecom T1 for the final?
