Nasus can hard carry games when ahead. It must be your play style. If you are a low elo player(gold or below), i would recommend watching videos on how to carry as top laners. The best coach in league atm is Last Shadow 9. His videos go incredibly indepth and he coaches players from all elo's so i would recommend checking out his youtube channel. If you are really looking to improve, try recording some of the games that you win lane yet lose lane in, then watch them back yourself and be hyper critical. Try and figure out what you should have done in each situation. Btw im not sure if you know this, but nasus excels at split pushing and team fighting when ahead, its just about picking the right time to time fight and the right time to split push.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flood","date":"2015-06-10T15:27:44.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1)Splitpush when the opponent is focused in team fights. This should only be done if your whole team is fed enough and/or able to defend the objective the enemy team is seeking. Even if you don't/can't splitpush, you can learn to slowpush the lane. This can be done by leaving 3-4 enemy minions alive. It will slowly accumulate and push the lane, pressuring the enemy team to either back off and protect turrets or lose turret completely. \n\n2)Teleport/Roam whenever there's a team fight or somewhere your team can capitalise on. When you see the bot lane having difficulties tp bot and help them win lane (either by killing or gaining objectives such as dragon or turret). Take into account number 1, the position of the top laner and the creep wave. You wouldn't want to lose top turret and unfavourable trades at bottom.\n\n3)Translating to late game, depending on composition, will either be peeling for the adc/apc or diving straight onto the enemy adc. This will heavily depend on the champion, but most Top Laners are the hard engagers of their team (Lissandra, Maokai, Pantheon, Riven etc). You must learn how to zone enemies, engage and peel for a successful team fight. \n\n\nGood luck","replies":[{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2015-06-11T02:46:57.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or just play Zilean","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Legends man1","date":"2015-06-11T02:03:34.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you say you're quite good at top lane, try to win the lane quickly i.e. kill enemy a few times and farm up a decent amount. (If you're playing Nasus you might wanna farm up a bit more) but once you've pretty much wrecked the enemy laner, and they're constantly zoned out of lane, roam mid or bot, whichever seems easier. If you have tp then bot lane if they're pressured, otherwise help mid out. \n\nAlso ward the river if your mid lane isn't and constantly look for where the enemy jungler is. That way you can push and be aggressive without worrying about ganks. It creates a ripple effect when you help out your mid, who then helps out bot, who then is back in the game. Of course it wont always work out as planned but just do your best at it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2015-06-11T00:50:16.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PLay Zilean","replies":[]},{"poster":"XSirCution","date":"2015-06-09T04:36:13.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well, these guys explained most of the thing.
