Not kills most of the time.\n\nAlso, {{champion:75}} Is one of the easiest for top lane at low MMR. Most teams won't know the teamwork required to shut him down, even if you don't get kills in your lane  you'll still chunk towers and inhibitors.

There is one variable that stays the same every ranked game you play, and its you. Getting out of silver is literally as simple as searching, \"how to get out of silver league of legends\" on youtube. There are very simple strategies that will get you out of silver without effort. Split pushing is one of the easiest.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fndrr22dxd","date":"2015-06-10T08:45:33.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Step 1) Learn how to CS properly\nStep 2) Learn when not to CS\nStep 3) Learn how to reset the minion wave, and how to make slow pushes for and against you\n\nDoing this will give you more than an enough advantage over the lower elo brackets.

Not entirely but yes. Yes you have idiot teammates, but if you are good enough and smart enough almost anyone is \"carryable\".\n\nI was in a similar situation. Silver 3 and going nowhere fast. Going W-L-W-L-W-L id end up on pretty much the same LP at the end of the day.  The answer for me was DUO. Have a friend with you in order to not get carried, but rather, reduce the \"idiot factor\" down by 1. Now im Gold 3 in my Gold 2 promos.\nIf you don't suck and your friend doesn't suck, well now its 2 people + 3 bots against 5 bots.\n\nhttp://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=Deathchewy\n\nYou have pretty average CS. I think the average Silver player gets about 6-6.5 cs per minute (from my experience). Yours is slightly below that usually. A minor thing you can work on.\n\nLooking at your Champion pool you play a lot of Top but also FIll. In my experience its really hard to carry from top lane. I used to be a top/adc main, now I mainly play Support for my friend who ADC's.\n\nYou have 911 games played yet your most played champion has 89 games. Kinda suggest that you play A LOT of different champions. Not necessarily a bad thing, but I think in Bronze/Silver/Gold you should only have 1-2 champions you play in order to \"master\" them. Certainly makes climbing easier when you know the in game matchup and more importantly you know HOW to win with that particular champion no matter the situation.\n\nYou've played 91 different champions this season...thats honestly pretty crazy. Take away the champions that have less then 10 games played and you've still played 35 different champions.\nI mean if your having fun then go for it, but if you want to climb, i'd cut back the champion pool a bit.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nIf your going to carry from top you have to have increase your influence on the map. I've had A LOT of games where I've been doing my thing top, 20 minutes into a game, i am 2-1-1 but the overall kills is like 31-12 to the enemy. I find myself isolated from everything.\nYou have to make a special effort to influence the map., Whether it be TP plays bottom or roaming mid or anything. Have influence elsewhere. Or you can smash your lane and draw the enemy jungler top and away form your team.","replies":[]}]}
