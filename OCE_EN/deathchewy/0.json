I currently only use{{champion:50}}, {{champion:45}}, {{champion:31}} or {{champion:238}} if i feel lucky enough. But i&#039;ve found most of those are quite difficult to play versing more experienced mid laners who understand their counters and such. Do i need to change my champ roster for mid or just not mid entirely?","replies":[{"poster":"iZulu","date":"2015-06-18T11:11:07.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Best thing you can do is play one mid lane champion, over and over and over, pick one you enjoy playing, and has good wave clear. Don't pick a champion just because the pro's play it, or just because its meta, you are way better off picking a champion that is underrated and disrespected as your opponent is unlikely to be familiar with the match up. Play a champ that you love and enjoy, that is the best advice I can give you :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2015-06-18T02:44:22.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you're open to change then yes, the mid meta is revolving around team fight control rather than assassination type play, pretty much late game carries, so you can go for {{champion:31}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:115}}, as a mid lane main myself i know its hard changing your champ pool to suit the meta but it does help, in saying that it is silver and you can honestly win on anything. Easiest way to carry a game is to not die","replies":[]},{"poster":"RUSTYtheCASTER","date":"2015-06-18T01:06:48.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You need not change your champion preferences to win games, especially not around the high silver level. There are Zed/Swain/Veigar players all the way up to diamond/master who are just preferential to those champions. \nIdeally ofcourse everyone picks the 'strongest' champion at the time but in saying that particularly in SoloQ, if you enjoy the champ and or main the champion it's generally stronger for you to play those champs rather than meta.\n\ntl;dr you need not change your champion pool if you enjoy them, just become super good at them and you'll be fine!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-18T00:39:02.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try morgana mid, it's ez as shit and there is no counterplay. Get ganked? just pop your shield spam laugh and walk away. She has good wave clear so she can force minion wave back to their turret and make them cri as you deny farm.

So choose a kind of counter with utility. If you're bad at mid it probably means you can't calculate the damage of your skills and work out if you can outplay for a kill or not. Go a utility mid laner and just focus on CS, staying safe and be a great utility for your team in teamfights late.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Knight Of Dawn","date":"2015-06-16T15:26:36.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I  agree just say in champ select not mid if its the only role your shthouse at :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-06-16T14:22:06.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If mid is your worst role you probably want to stay away from stuff like swain and veigar that can't really do much when behind. Maybe try out something like Lulu or Ziggs or something that you can play into any matchup and can still get farm and be useful if do get a bit behind early. If you're in your worst role, that means most of your team got the stuff they wanted so going even will probably give you a good winrate.\n\nYou could also just avoid mid completely. Mid is easily the most popular and I doubt you would have to dodge more than once every 30 or 40 games (and its only like -3 Lp or something right?) if you mentioned you'd rather not mid in champ select.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-06-16T11:34:01.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:1}} \n\nEasy and OP","replies":[]}]}
