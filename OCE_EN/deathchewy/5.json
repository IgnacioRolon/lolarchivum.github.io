Currently this season, I&#039;m sitting at a total of 857 ranked matches with 370 in top lane and a total win rate of 51.7% (440 wins). My point is I&#039;ve got experience working in my favor but however i still manage to lose games versing less experienced match ups due to my own and my team&#039;s mistakes. Experience means everything does it not?\r\n\r\nWhen i receive top lane, i rely on mainly 5-6 champions\r\n{{champion:75}} Total games: 85  Win rate: 67-70%\r\n{{champion:266}} Total games: 48  Win rate: 64.6%\r\n{{champion:86}}  Total games: 28 Win rate: 64.3%\r\n{{champion:31}} Total games: 21 Win rate: 71.4%\r\n{{champion:83}} Total games: 18 Win rate: 72.2%\r\n{{champion:8}} Total games: 11 Win rate: 72.7%\r\n\r\nI&#039;m primarily a Nasus main followed by Aatrox if Aatrox didn&#039;t have so many bad match ups working against him\r\n\r\nWhen i receive my main champions, I&#039;m quite capable of winning my lane but I don&#039;t wish to sound negative but my teammates often let me down in winning theirs too but i find my style of play a bit awkward for teamwork especially on Nasus.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m wondering still if there is stuff i still need to improve on and/or I just get less experienced teammates then myself.\r\n\r\nI&#039;d really appreciate helpful advice or criticism to help me along and maybe even a few tips from even more experienced players.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-03T08:11:48.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First up gonna use league of graphs\n\nhttp://www.leagueofgraphs.com/summoner/oce/Deathchewy\n\nIf you look here, you have a 58% win rate in top lane, but you need to pick up your abilitys in support/mid/adc or always get your second role as jungler.\n\nFact is in solo you need to either be able to play all lanes, and play them all to a decent standard.","replies":[{"poster":"Deathchewy","date":"2015-06-03T08:26:40.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand that and i do have the backup roles of support and jungler but I've never done well in mid or adc unless I'm playing a champion i know well","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-03T08:51:00.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Learn it then, fact is your not going to always get top, you can have a 70% win rate in top, but if your win rate everywhere else is too low, then there's a big chance you won't actually climb (not quickly anyway)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rydia of Mist","date":"2015-06-03T06:56:06.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since u top laner  do u always have tp?
