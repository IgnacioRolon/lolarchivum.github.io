Example being {{item:3072}}  runes or even just a {{item:1055}}.  I appreciate the buff they added with the grievous wounds but it&#039;s not enough. You&#039;ll find 100% their damage outweighs what they take. The biggest offenders are high damage ad carries or wide auto carries,{{champion:29}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:67}}. In the example of {{champion:29}} why should he be able to ult through 3 {{item:3075}} and still live.\r\nIt&#039;s a good item, it&#039;s just a waste of gold for what it&#039;s &quot;supposed&quot; to do. Even on a person like {{champion:33}}, you need to be blind to die to {{item:3075}}.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-06-20T11:31:36.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thornmail isn't designed to kill, it's designed to mitigate both the damage you take and the health they restore. If you want tanky damage you take things like Dead Man's or Sterak's.\n\nI agree that Thornmail isn't really in the best place right now, but not with the reason.","replies":[{"poster":"Deathchewy","date":"2018-06-20T14:12:11.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definitely agree with what you say but the issue is that it doesn't do even that well.","replies":[]}]}]}
