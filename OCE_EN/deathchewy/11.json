Funnily enough, no one has noticed even when I have said something. most of the reaction is \"What? Really?\" Kinda shows our dependance on that item and not noticing any changes. I first noticed it when playing Cassiopeia however at the time, i thought her passive and death cap's didn't stack and then i began to play more mages and saw the same problem. My question is. Is it broken? and if so has anyone noticed, it's broken?","replies":[{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-03-24T07:19:29.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kids, do le math in-game.\n\nThere is nothing wrong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lumer","date":"2015-03-24T04:10:28.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just for anyone reading this, S@20 had something about this in their red post collection. They said it is still giving ap and the bonus ap, it just does not reflect it in the tooltip.
