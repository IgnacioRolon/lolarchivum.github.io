It&#039;s designed to be deter/punish ad heavy champions who auto attack you. Example being the entire adc lineup. \n\nBiggest culprits being lifesteal and anything that boost it. Thornmail&#039;s damage reflect and grevious wounds are therefore negated. At best, thornmail will do around 30-40magic damage reflect for an auto based off your armour. Adc&#039;s will typically buy a {{item:3072}} which provides 20% lifesteal.\n\nIf they auto attack you, grevious wounds applies changing that to 10%, this isn&#039;t accounting for runes like fleet footwork, overheal and bloodline in the precision tree. Around this time should bloodthrister be their 3rd/4th item, they will be around 250-300 damage depending on champion. Yes, this math seems well where an auto attack will heal 30 health or so and then lose 30 health on thornmail. This doesn&#039;t deter champions, this doesn&#039;t punish as if an adc is in the right spot, they won&#039;t lose more health then they gain. \n\nI find also the only person who actually uses thornmail and does what it is supposed to do is obviously {{champion:33}} who&#039;s entire kit is based around self damage on the enemy through defensive curl and taunt. Otherwise thornmail later on just becomes a wasted item slot better filled with something esle.","replies":[{"poster":"Joiksu","date":"2018-02-21T16:35:05.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thornmail is good for some top laners though, and an early bramble vest is essential vs some champions (e.g. Fiora).\n\nItems that really should be fixed or changed are the gold items on supports (every man and his dog are taking these), and damage that enables waveclear could be tuned down. However in patch 8.4 Riot are going with the approach that they will tune up the **wave damage** with the new barons. I guess Riot just want quick games.","replies":[{"poster":"Deathchewy","date":"2018-02-22T04:09:38.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I was going to state that but top laners arent the ones \"Supposed' to do all the damage","replies":[]}]}]}
