Not to mention the amount of available characters in that role to choose from. \n\nBut then I've unfortunately got a bad point, with such a variaty of characters and ways they play. How come all your ADC's build almost the exact same item path every game being{{item:3031}} {{item:3094}} {{item:3508}} and a final crit item being sometimes{{item:3087}}. \n\nIt ends up to a point where the most common played ADC's are ones with who can take advantage of the 100% critical hit \"CHANCE\" examples being the ones i praised earlier and {{champion:51}}. I understand the whole thing of what it's happening but by the end of game when an in-game mechanic of \"Critical hit chance\" becomes less chance and more guaranteed on every attack, It turns most games in a situation where the ADC with the better crit usage is usually the winning factor. I understand that they should be that kind of factor but not based of how much\n better they can \"Chance\" the crit.\n\nWhat i'm asking for honestly, is a different play style of ADC. not just crit machine 2000. \n\nI understand how it sounds like I'm just whining but is this really a good way for the game to be played?","replies":[{"poster":"BurstFire304","date":"2020-01-05T00:04:04.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the strongest 7 adc according to op.gg are aphelios mf cait lucian ashe senna vayne. if we look at the top 5 most common 3 item choices for these 7 champs its 34 unique build orders for the first 3 items (op.gg) this means that only one build (essence ie rapid, lucian and mf) is shared in terms of exact permutations. now yes when we look at full 3 item builds combinations there is more overlap (too complex / time consuming for me to investigate but it would be about 80% of 34 which is 27) but thats still a lot of diversity in the role. also not all of these adcs even centre around crit. lucian ashe and vayne all go bork and senna goes manamune into lethality. all in all this is a complex problem thats going to be solved over years through minor changes across patches. riot is doing a decent job","replies":[]},{"poster":"Infinity Boy","date":"2020-01-01T08:21:51.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, good point.
