Positioning probably could be better but I think its pretty good. Yeah I pay attention to minion location and how the enemy plays. Map observation is a bit lacking but it works sometimes.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-22T11:06:07.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well then you've got something to work on! A lot of improving is not only recognising mistakes or things you could do better, but developing the habits. For example, if you notice your map awareness is a bit lacking then work on that first. Good map awareness can save you and your teammates from devastating ganks and keep you one step ahead of the enemy so it's pretty up there in importance.\n\nMake an effort in your next game to check the map after every other CS or just every few seconds. Even if it's just a glance, you'd be surprised how much information you can get from less that a seconds attention. In particular in the early game keep a close eye on the enemy jungler, know where they are and it makes your lane that much easier. You know when you can play aggressive, and when you should back off, and even if it doesn't give you that early lead, it does a lot to stop the enemy from taking it.\n\nTry to work on one thing at a time. You aren't trying to learn everything as fast as possible, it's quality over quantity here beyond the basics. If you try to do too many things at once you'll just end up average at all of them. We tend to be our own worst critics, so once your map awareness or whatever you choose to work on first is somewhere you're proud of it, pick something else. You'll more than likely come back full circle, but that's just part of climbing :)","replies":[{"poster":"Deathchewy","date":"2018-01-22T11:44:10.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can see all your points except one I'm not climbing, I'm just plummeting.

Fresh ranked accounts start with S3-4~ mmr, so if you would normally vs people lower than that it's entirely possible that your rank is simply higher than your skill at the moment. Until you play about 100+ ranked game winrate doesn't mean all that much, because low sample sizes have a very polarising effect on averages.\n\nLosing consistently probably means you're vsing people who are quite a bit better than you, and it's taking your mmr a while to adjust.","replies":[{"poster":"Deathchewy","date":"2018-01-22T13:47:13.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you mean ranked in general...uh no.

Certainly not enough to where I'd be too worried about win rates. If it puts it in perspective, 1 loss in 2 games is a 50% loss rate, 1 loss in 100 games is 1%.\n\nYou've only played 30~ games in ranked, so your winrate will be all over the place for a while. A decent loss streak this early can tank your winrate, but it really doesn't mean anything because over the season it will become irrelevant.\n\nYou seem to be having success with Yorick (except for that last game...) and other tankier top laners, so maybe stick with that for a while until you get your mojo back.","replies":[{"poster":"Deathchewy","date":"2018-01-24T13:07:21.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"XD that last game was a computer problem where fps dropped to 2 and i couldnt do anything so yeah.
