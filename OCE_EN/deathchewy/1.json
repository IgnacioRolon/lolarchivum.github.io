Keep that \"This season i've got 1050 ranked games and still silver\" mentality out of it because that's not going to help you one bit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"flamingsword2","date":"2015-07-11T03:37:06.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, \nI just wanted to say that the most important thing is your mentality.\nLeague of Legends is a game. You play it to have fun.\nBefore criticising other players's mistakes, **look at yourself first**.\n\nIf you are getting below 70cs @10min, you should try to improve rather than criticising teammates for giving up a kill. Note: **14CS = 1 Kill**.\nAlso, normals is a game where people to mess around, practise new champions/builds, have fun. If the enemy top laner is better, then your top laner's score would look really bad. Don't blame your teammates.\n\nAlways look at your games positively, and always look for opportunities to win.\nRemember, if you have the skill of a gold-tier player, you **will** get there.\n\nGood Luck,\nflamingsword2","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-11T02:49:21.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Biggest thing for silver is this.\n\nIf you have a lead, SNOWBALL IT, Roam, force teamfights, actually win the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-07-12T01:01:56.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"well its only silver so probs just pick stuff that can abuse enemy teams mistakes really well so stuff like vlad, riven, ryze and rumble where if they position poorly youll solo ace them : ) u can play aatrox pretty well but tbh that champ is garbo outside of lane phase","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-07-11T03:47:13.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"because you need to win 3 games for every loss to go anywhere, riot thought it would be funny to do that.\n\nAlso, bronze and silver people have a lot of trouble keeping with the pressure of split pushing, if you can have a team that can distract or 4v5 easily, you get the 5th wheel to split, causing the enemy confusion, as whether to fight your team of 4, break 1 or 2 off to stop you, increasing their chance to lose the team fight,  all going after you, allowing the team of 4 to push.\n\nGood split push champions are:\nmid: Zed, Viktor, Diana and Talon(they may not seem it, but they actually really are, Vik, with 200 ap and a lich bane, do not under estimate the rate he can kill towers, although i would keep him in the teamfight, he does too much aoe damage for the team to afford losing + his escape isnt too reliable if their whole team comes without warning, Diana, same deal as viktor, her passive is effective taking towers, but has to either kill her enemies or leave before they arrive and talon q is a free 200-300 bonus damage to the tower every 3 seconds, and he can escape well.)\ntop: Jax, Trynd, Fiora , Nasus\njungle: Shaco, Xin Zhao, Vi, lee (if you make good use of his passive) and Master yi\nsupport: people who enhance attack damage or speed, such as Janna, though i don't recommend taking out the supp to split\nadc: same as supp, don't recommend doing it if you need team fights, but jinx and Tristana are really good at it, and in right circumstances (good use of passive and w, sheen is good with it too) ezreal\n\nin other words, lower elo struggle with people split pushing well, split pushers also usually get large amounts of cs, being loaded with gold to buy items.","replies":[]}]}
