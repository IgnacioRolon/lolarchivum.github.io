I&#039;m talking about the game itself.  It&#039;s not fun to play when the same picks come out beating you no matter what. The ways to counter picks don&#039;t exist like they used to. Taking loads of damage? Build armour. Opponenet builds lethality and armour pen and whoops, you should have bought damage instead at this point.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-12-16T21:41:51.967+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you here, the game is no fun when everyone one-hits everyone else.\n\nPersonally I still don't understand the purpose of lethality on all these assassin items.\nThe whole point of assassins is that they can delete squishies with their burst, but lack the sustained damage to deal with tanks and their armour/mr.\n\nBut squishies don't build armour, so therefore the only point of having lethality is to make assassins better against tanks, which is supposed to be their greatest counter?\n\nIf you must put lethality on something, put lethality on sustained damage items like Phantom Dancer or something, don't give it to burst items like Duskblade..\n\nThe only counter to damage at this point, is more damage.\nWhich is why you don't see much Nautilus or Rammus or other true tanks anymore, its all Vi or Shyv and all those _'tanks'_ that have enough damage to shred anyone.\n\n_(sigh)_","replies":[{"poster":"Hounorsboy","date":"2017-12-17T00:43:17.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"This meta is still better than tank meta though, thank god it is gone","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-12-17T03:31:48.357+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Except tank meta wasn't about actual tanks, it was certain assassins with high %health damage building tank.\n\nWhile real tanks were being melted within seconds by everyone else.\nSo no one was playing real tanks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-12-17T09:43:37.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No way, tank meta's are way better then damage meta's, because at least there is more counter-play in proper tank meta's.\n\nAssassin meta's are about being 1-shot with as little counterplay as possible.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-12-22T12:01:49.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nautilus is good though?

Yeah sure the matchup becomes horrible after darius gets his cleaver, but people underestimate how much kill pressure a naut can bring to early lane with a doran's blade or ring.\n\nNaut's early laning is held back by mana pool, but it is quite possible to bully a darius/fiora/garen/swain out of lane for the first few levels at the cost of a bit of mana and the risk of a gank. The hard bit is explaining to your team why you can't 1v1 a 0-4 fiora later on, and why you need to be grouped for most of the rest of the match.\n\nNaut can beat alot of his 'counters' by playing aggressive before items, and after he plays safe and farms till he scales as a teamfight menace, being both tanky with decent consistent aoe damage, engage, pick potential, distruption and amazing cc. A fed nautilus, whilst not very menacing as a 1v1 opponent, can and *will* just dive into the enemy team, and with his w spam for a %hp shield, he's just going to sit there and not die.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-12-23T11:16:57.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're missing my point,\n\nThe argument for playing Nautilus shouldn't be _\"He's got lots of damage\"_, he's a fricken tank, he shouldn't have ANY damage, the reason you should play him is for his CC and tankiness.\n\nIts this whole damage meta that screws over our whole view of champs, instead of thinking _\"Oh ill help my team by being a CC monster\"_, you're thinking _\"Ill smash them early with my damage!\"_.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LunaLovegood","date":"2017-12-18T12:26:39.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know armor is most effective the less there is, like its more worth your money the less there is, so building lethality does insane amounts of damage to squishies due to it removing more percentage mitigation. dealing close to true damage to them so its very good to build into squishies","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-12-18T07:46:38.891+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only play ARAM, but you can come up against a 5 AD champ team as a tank, build nothing but armour and health, and still just melt in 2 seconds flat.\n\nAt least a tank meta is a fun game, not just 100-0 in under a second.

Shaco's fast combo (not much of a combo, literally just firing e before getting the backstab crit, so that the e lands just after you finish cancelling the last bit of your first auto with tiamat) doesn't proc electrocute, and so it's very awkward as someone who likes to swap between electrocute for earlygame vs dark harvest for games where either the game will go for longer, or the enemy teamcomp has lanes that would be easy to camp, or a jungler I can counterjungle, or I'm just higher ranked than the other players due to weird matchmaking.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-12-23T06:23:13.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it was just a side effect of removing Sheen/hextech revolver proc's out of the calculations.\n\nIt was just a removal of ALL extra's, you needing the extra hit, is probably more a fault in the champion then a fault in thunderlords having been changed.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-12-16T23:34:38.231+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Aka let's go play PUBG or Overwatch for a while","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2017-12-22T09:54:43.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How come they not doing away with the ranking  atm?

Level 1-5. I win against riven and decide go for {{item:3742}} . Could have gone damage with cleaver sure but then i lose cause her damage is stronger.\n\n Come back to lane with {{item:1031}} and then riven hits 6. All my Armour and all my survivability the moment she gets her ult. From that point onward, I need to play safe against her or die. Bit of a lose lose if you ask me. If you try to engage, I hit shield and lose all my damage or she dashes with her 40% cd and dodges all my skill shots. Once 15 minutes hit, She has her {{item:3071}} which therefore negates my{{item:3047}} {{item:3742}} and what other Armour i have at that time.\n\nThen the rest of game goes and the history shows.
