I have 500 ranked matches under my belt this season, I main top lane most of the time but unfortunately I don&#039;t get it 80% of matches.  Am i not learning from my losses or am i just struck with bad luck for teammates?","replies":[{"poster":"Saldean","date":"2015-04-07T05:42:44.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When season 5 started I said to my friends that this isn't going to be a soft reset, everyone is going to get hit with a hard one. I can relate myself to you since I was Plat four and from my provisional matches I went into gold five(5-5). It depends on when and how did you finish your provisional matches there. \n\nI have looked at your profile as well and you said that you play top lane so its good. However the total of games you have played is 500 and man that is a lot so now I am wondering if you reflect on the losses you have even including the victories as well? for luck I only include the time of the day and that doesn't merge with my attitude in my games. Maybe a suggestion but if you think that you are losing too many ranked games( I limit myself to 2) then take a day off league and do something else, recreational activities or study time.","replies":[]}]}
