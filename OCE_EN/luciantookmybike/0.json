However when i look at the store none of the skins really appeal to me or they are on a champion I don't play. Looking back at past events some of the skins that were only available if you purchased the pass were very nice but it they were locked behind a paywall. I think it would be a nice addition if they were to place these limited addition skins into the mythic crafting store, requiring the 10 gemstones to unlock as they are still classed as \"mythic skins\" even though they are not from the mythic store. This would  allow for people who have played the game for a long time to be able to achieve these skins while not having to pay with real money for them or allows players who may of missed the skins due to them not being able to put in the time to play the game able to unlock these really cool skins.","replies":[{"poster":"Funderpants","date":"2020-01-16T10:02:56.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"100% would be awesome if this could be a thing, there were a few events i missed out on as i was unable to play due to sickness and also lack of internet at one point and would've loved the chance to obtain one of those event exclusive prestige edition skins","replies":[]}]}
