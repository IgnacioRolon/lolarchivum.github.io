Riot should implement a system where bug splats would not count towards leaverbuster, and WTF i understand getting a loss in my history so flex goes to 2/10 games played. WAIT i get 3/10 games so two loss&#039;s\r\n\r\nSo morale of the story MAKE SURE SHIT WORKS BEFORE ITS RELEASED TO BETA, and at least make sure people can always say no to beta however i cant go to the normal client.","replies":[{"poster":"EndOfDragon","date":"2016-11-17T09:25:43.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update: Okay so it seems Beta client cant update probably the reason seems i can launch old league through the .exe in my LoL directory, but still would be nice to have my 2 loss's taken away and my leaverbuster queue aswell.\nUpdate: Now it says two games played at least.... from relaunching client again, still would like that game taken away and to have leaverbuster removed, but its RITO and they dont take responsibility for these types of things, but it is a company and they have there own business to attend too","replies":[]}]}
