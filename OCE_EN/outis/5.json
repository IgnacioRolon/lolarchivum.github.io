BUT THIS IS IRRELEVANT TO THE SITUATION IM PRESENTING.\n\nThe POINT of this post is to show that the SAME PERSON is somehow \"good enough\" to climb on 1 account but \"not good enough\" to climb on another. BUT the astounding thing is the DIFFERENCE between W/L between the 2 accounts and how the one with a NEGATIVE W/L during the ENTIRE season was able to climb TIERS yet the account with a 100% of the season POSITIVE W/L was unable to climb. Why? It comes down to very specific games you win/loss IE PROMOS and the timing of streaks and a lot of the time these games are decided by factors out of your control (just like potentially any game). \n\nTHEY ARE BOTH ESSENTIALLY SILVER BECAUSE OF THE MMR THAT YOU KEEP BRINGING UP (or at least for the majority of the season this was the case) BUT ONLY 1 HAS A SILVER GRAPHIC. Where's the logic in that?\n\nbasically this illustrates that people, in a lot of cases, ARE NOT where they belong. There's plenty of people \"stuck\" in a certain tier and there's plenty of people in a tier they shouldn't be in.\n\nhow do you explain 1 account climbing from b4 to s1 after 60 games with a 41% w/l yet the other account 60 games into the season with a 55% w/l could not? shouldn't it be the other way around?\n\nIf you don't see the problem with this system then i don't understand what else to say.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-11-03T01:21:12.127+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're salty and just complain when i just gave my understanding you can speak to Riot, I think you're the one that doesn't understand it doesnt matter if you have 100- 80 Losses..
