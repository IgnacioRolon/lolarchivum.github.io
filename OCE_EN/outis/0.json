Depending on the specific circumstances, the systems in place may have followed the standard progression (starting with a chat restriction) rather than escalating straight away. While the use of such language isn't acceptable, it's also important to consider that there are rare occasions where people might be frustrated to a point where they say or do something they wouldn't normally, and if it's (for example) only a single instance of that behaviour, there's a far better case for a more lenient approach to a punishment.\n\nIf you believe the case hasn't been properly addressed, you can feel free to submit a ticket to [Support](https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"Report a player for cheating, phishing, or negative behaviour\" option) and they will review the case further to ensure the correct action is being taken.

It is more accurate to say that such behaviours fall into the category of \"*can* escalate\", as they are the exceptions to the natural 4-tier progression.\n\nThe misconception stemmed from a few things, largely that they *often* escalate, and also that much of our official information comes from NA where the system does punish slightly differently (the system recognises a degree of regional difference). That one's on me for making statements as more definitive than they should have been.\n\nUltimately, there is a significant degree of individuality in punishment, and there are a whole bunch of background factors that go into determining where, when, and how harsh of a punishment will be issued. We will never be able to give 100% accurate predictions/info based solely on a single reform card/chat log (and certainly not on less) and we generally acknowledge this by avoiding making definitive statements (and by pointing to support). Sometimes it gets forgotten or glossed over too quickly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2020-01-27T03:55:39.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I've always tried to avoid using definitive statements regarding Riot's \"zero-tolerance language\", because ultimately I wasn't entirely sure whether it was as strict as that, and given some of the cases I had seen and heard of I was inclined to think that certain lenience existed for edge cases. I know some of the other volunteers had always gone for the \"zero-tolerance will *always* escalate\" style, but as far as I recall I've never stated as such, rather I always defaulted to (or at least tried to default to) statements like \"zero-tolerance will escalate in most-every case\".\n\nAs far as I'm aware, Riot's stance on such language hasn't changed, it's just that they've always talked about it with a specific implication of \"always escalating\" (despite never actually stating that, as far as I'm aware), and that's just the conclusion most people (even the volunteers) had come to about it. Keep in mind, Riot always likes to talk about designing their punishment systems around reform, so it makes sense in that context for certain edge cases to be given a certain leniency in such situations, but it also makes sense that they wouldn't want to outright confirm it works like that to avoid trolls and such \"abusing\" that by very selectively using such language.\n\nUltimately, if any player thinks that a system isn't working properly, the standard way of addressing the issue is to submit a ticket to Support, and should successfully address the vast majority of cases, which is why it's almost always recommended for people to do that.","replies":[{"poster":"Outis","date":"2020-01-28T11:43:50.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok thanks for the answer. problem is, the most recent case of this happening for me was no way an 'edge case'. nobody was provoking them in any way or even typed anything them. they literally started calling people the N word and telling them to kill themselves after getting killed. \n\nalso, we again have this problem of contradiction when it comes to what the 'stance' is here. any other volunteer here has made it clear it is totally irrelevant what someone else may do or say to you and that you are 100% judged on what you did or said. plenty of people have received escalation for their first instance of 'zero tolerance' language, even with 100s or even 1000s of games of good standing (perhaps this is what could have changed? but i find it hard to believe most times i've reported someone for these things in the past year or so, it has always been their first time.) so i'm not entirely sure what is meant by 'edge case'. could you give an example?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2020-01-29T01:23:17.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what I mean by \"edge case\" is primarily instances where the behaviour itself falls into one of two categories; either being abnormal behaviour for the player (for example, someone who has a positive/neutral standing across thousands of games) or minimal engagement (for example, it might be only a single instance of the language being used). In both categories, there is a certain logic to exploring leniency.\n\nUltimately, though, I can't give any exact examples of the kinds of situations that Riot's systems would put into the \"edge case pile\", to get more information on that you could try reaching out to Support and see what you get back (I doubt they'll be inclined to go into too much detail, but it may provide more insight). At the end of the day, you have the automated system and *many* Support agents addressing these kinds of situations all the time, so it's possible (perhaps even likely) that certain (minor) discrepancies may exist in how such situations are addressed.\n\nOne factor that the volunteers always have to consider when dealing with cases like this through the boards is that not all information is going to be completely reliable for two main reasons; for one thing, certain individuals may intentionally lie, omit facts, and/or bend the truth to make the situation seem worse than it is, and arguably more common is that people may subconsciously exaggerate certain facts (refer to concepts like \"negativity bias\" and \"confirmation bias\") without realising it. Note: the former being an intentional act, while the latter is a subconscious, unintentional thought process.\n\nGenerally, we don't have a way to determine if either of those is happening in a given case, so we tend to rely on the information provided being accurate and try to address the case as such. Even so, it may sometimes mean we don't get things 100% accurate for a given situation, which can create certain perceptions that things don't always work \"as advertised\" (it wont *always* work as such, flaws exist, but it should work reliably most of the time). This is actually one of the reasons we recommend players to Support, because ultimately the Support agents will be able to verify most, if not all, of the claims that a person makes in a given situation, which will ultimately lead to an appropriate resolution.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rallick","date":"2019-12-27T02:09:24.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"it's also important to consider that there are rare occasions where people might be frustrated to a point where they say or do something they wouldn't normally, and if it's (for example) only a single instance of that behaviour, there's a far better case for a more lenient approach to a punishment.\"\n\nI got abused by two players on my team for 15mins, which i should've muted i know, but i snapped back at them about what they had said, including the standard 'kys' that these types of people seem to like and neither of them got a penalty but i got immediately chat restricted post game for spam as they had reported me (they told me in the postgame lobby).
