So far as *this* instance, it's largely reliant on the legislation regarding taxation of online goods and services in specific countries/regions, since that's the primary reason for these changes. Quite frankly, you shouldn't expect any kind of significant reverse on those taxes.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
