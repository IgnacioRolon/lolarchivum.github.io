My very first week at the Dublin office, I heard shouting from individuals playing together, calling each other &ldquo;f%%%%%s&rdquo; repeatedly. I was unnerved, but it was my first week and I didn&rsquo;t know if this was a common occurrence. I didn&rsquo;t say anything at that time. Eventually, the language would escalate to &ldquo;n%%%%%&rdquo;. No one flinched, and I realized it was considered the norm. Nearly the same thing happened my first day of meetings at the Riot LA office, where two men were loudly calling each other &ldquo;c*cksuckers&rdquo; right outside the office of the CEOs&quot;\n\nLMAOOOOOOOOOOOOO. im not laughing at the language being used, im laughing at the blatant hypocrisy here.\n\nno doubt Seras and co will somehow keep defending this company.\n\ninb4 this is deleted.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-08-12T02:29:51.157+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is how my group of friends act all the time, difference is there's no malice between us, always shouting somewhat offensive terms is part of how we deal with tilt, even in a 5 man, if the enemy is playing teemo for example, we often spend most of the game camping and abusing him, (teemo tears are best tears) however we keep it in discord, so nothing can come of it.\n\nAs a group infighting is common, but never any harmful things come of it, mostly just trash talk, im sure to a point its the same at Riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-08-09T22:50:31.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quick note: There's currently no reason for any of the mods to delete this thread. It is, in it's current state, simple a conversational point based around the \"culture at Riot games\", which isn't in breach of any boards rules. *If* the \"discussion\" were to escalate to the point where several individuals were regularly abusing each other that might change, but there's nothing to warrant such action yet.\n\nJust to note, I've not read the kotaku article, rather I'm specifically talking about the \"snippet\" that has been put in the main post.\n\nAs for the topic itself, I think it depends a lot on the individuals who are actually in that environment. If none of the people involved and about take issue with such behaviours, is there really a significant problem? If those same people who are involved can control their behaviours when with others who might take offence to that kind of language, do we really need to know/care about how they act in more private situations?\n\nIt's my personal believe that people can do what they want in private if no one takes offence. I wouldn't necessarily condone the behaviour, depending on what it is, but if it's not actually hurting anyone, and not affecting people who aren't in that situation, what's the issue? When it does come to things like dark humour and \"toxic banter\" among friends, you need to consider that's a different scenario than doing so with random people.\n\n*Personally*, I do occasionally engage in some such behaviours with certain friends and friend groups, but I always try to keep it \"mild\", and I always try to keep track of the situation to gauge whether I've gone too far. I feel confident that if any of my friends take issue with somethings I've said or done, they'll tell me, and we can deal with it in a civilised manner.\n\nWith that said, I rarely even attempt such behaviours with people I don't know, will keep away from the more \"serious\" topics and always try to \"read the room\" *before* saying anything like that, and it works for me. I've never had an indication that someone taken offence to something along those lines that I've said, and haven't received any \"feedback\" from the systems in-game to tell me that someone did take offence.\n\nI'm sure there will be some people who disagree with what I've said, whether they think the behaviour simply shouldn't exist or whether they think people in general need to \"stop being so sensitive\". That's fine, everyone will see things like this differently, the important thing to keep in mind here is that we should keep this discussion civilised, rather than let it devolve into who can fling the most insults and abuse.\n\nJust a quick tip: When using the asterisk \"\\*\" in posts (as well as other symbols used for formatting posts, such as with **bold** and ~~strikethrough~~), you can use the forward slash \"\\\" (usually located near the backspace key) to prevent the symbol from triggering the format, which in the case of your post is some italics between a couple of the terms you've used.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-08-09T12:29:32.613+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Kotaku is a website run by left wing ideologue. They love and falsify stories relating to race and sexism. \n\nTheir article on Jessica Price, Arena Net sexism. Was a one sided biased story about men mistreating women at work.\n\nHere is some left wing quotes from the article above.\n1\n> \"“If two Rioters are doing the same job, they’re evaluated on a similar criteria,” she said. When I asked whether she’s looking at why women might not perform at the same level as men - whether there might be structural issues preventing women from making as much progress at work - she said,** “I’m not sure there’s a deliberate effort to look into that.” **\n\n2\n>\"Others - women, primarily - were handed sieves with wide holes. Success escaped. **They were no less hardworking, no less talented**. But the superstructure benefiting their peers was **more difficult for them to become a part of because of the way it was built.**\"\n\n3\n>\"The Rioter continued, “I think Riot has grown very fast and not having a planned out organisational structure that **encourages diversity has hurt us**. We are trying to fix that now. It’s just **hard to fix things when they’ve already started**. It’s easier to start things the right way and build on that.”\n\nAM SURE there are so much more; But i cant be bothered looking for it. The read was a waste of time. Dont believe what Kotaku wrote in a serious manner, they are a feminist website that hate men.","replies":[]}]}
