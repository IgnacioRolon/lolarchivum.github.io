A few things to consider, however.\n\nFirstly, it's my understanding that a single use of zero-tolerance language wont *necessarily* escalate to a ban, as it doesn't indicate any consistency for the behaviour. It can often escalate when grouped in with other behaviours, but generally \"single use\" cases are walking the line.\n\nSecondly, the system isn't perfect (no system is), so it's possible that it could miss things from time to time, and if you feel like the standard post-game report isn't sufficient, you can feel free to submit a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) directly.\n\nLastly, while the IFS notifications are a great feature, there's a couple important details to keep in mind about them. For one thing, they were never designed to notify more than one person, only sending out a notification based on the *most recent* report that contributed to a punishment, and it even seems like the system fails to do that on more than a few occasions. Point being, a lack of the IFS notification doesn't indicate a lack of punishment.\n\nOne final note; you shouldn't feel like you *have* to report a behaviour just because it's something Riot punishes. A large part of how \"punishable behaviour\" is determined comes down to how the community *reports* behaviours in-game (beyond their normal functions, reports are essentially used by Riot as feedback on what kinds of behaviours the community doesn't want to see). It's always good to help identify punishable behaviours, but if it's something you don't feel *needs* to be punished you should also consider that in how you choose to utilise the report system.","replies":[{"poster":"Outis","date":"2019-05-19T21:16:58.087+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=hzup1m2Q,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-05-18T06:48:05.163+0000)\n>\n> \n> \n> Firstly, it's my understanding that a single use of zero-tolerance language wont *necessarily* escalate to a ban, as it doesn't indicate any consistency for the behaviour.

After all, if it's a *single* statement that is being looked at over a period of several months and/or several dozen games then it would be a bit harsh to escalate to a 14-day ban if the person in question had never been punished before. A chat restriction, sure, but a ban in that kind of scenario would be a bit of an overreaction, just because it could happen to *anyone* as a singular, abnormal act.\n\nLike I said though, that's my understanding of the system, and I'm not entirely sure if it does work *exactly* like that.

If an account was manually punished the agent that issued that punishment may have chosen to only give a chat restriction for the reasons HeartVine mentioned, though I am unclear if this hypothetical actually reflects the situation you found yourself in.\n\nYour best bet would simply be to submit your report in a support ticket and it can be manually reviewed (though do be aware they won't give you *any* information about another player's account).","replies":[{"poster":"Outis","date":"2019-05-31T12:45:53.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok i reported another player for using the N word with a hard r. this was over 24hrs ago and he is still playing as of 31 minutes ago. the previous player was reported for calling people F*****s 18 days ago. his last game was 9 days ago. so he is either banned now or hasn't played. either way he was still playing for 9 days after the fact.\n\ni think that it has now happened on 2 separate occasions in a short time frame shows that either your information on this system is now obsolete or the system is not working properly. if simply not typing anything else the rest of the game let's you get away with it, then the system is pretty flawed and legitimizes all the posts you see perceiving 'they didn't get punished'.\n\nin regards to it being manually punished. i thought this kind of thing is always reviewed by the bot. why even have the bot if it's not being used for 100% of the cases. also, if manual review is going to yield different results, well that opens up a huge can of worms in terms of consistency. basically anyone that has ever been banned or suspended by the bot should either be unbanned or have their account standing fixed, if this is the case.\n\nedit: ill add that the 2nd guy i reported told me in post game \"nothing will happen, the most ive ever had was a 14 day ban\".","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-05-31T13:51:26.092+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Other than directing you to support, I'm not sure what else to tell you. We have the information we've been given, and the majority of feedback we get gives me no reason to doubt that information. \n\nUltimately, there are exceptions to every rule. I don't know what the exact details of these two situations are, I don't know the details of their account standing or the reports submitted.\n\nWe also have no way of knowing this information since they aren't going to release information about a player to a 3rd party under *any* circumstances (actual legal stuff aside), nor should they.\n\nThe best advice I can give is to pass your evidence onto support.\n\nThe reason manual reviews exist is in part oversight to ensure the automated is doing it's job, and also to handle niche cases. For example, someone is getting reported for hate speech almost every game by all players, but the system can't nail down the why, so it passes it on to manual review. \n\nOr, one I have seen relatively recently, someone is at third tier (14 day for next offence) and is getting reported *a lot*, but for minor offences that the system isn't triggering for the harsher punishment. They're obviously annoying a lot of people and negatively (but low impact) affecting a lot of experiences, so it's passed onto manual review and they get one or two more chat restrictions before moving up to the 14-day.\n\n_These don't by any stretch happen often_. These are edge cases, but edge cases are typically what we hear about and remember.
