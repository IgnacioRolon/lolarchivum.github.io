There is no one else quite like her in the game and is definitely one of my favourite champions. I usually don&#039;t read champion lores unless either 1. I love the champion or 2. I have nothing else to do, but recently I read Orianna&#039;s lore and thoroughly enjoyed it. Then an idea popped into my head. What if Orianna had a skin (legendary or ultimate) of when she was human? I know this may be a long process but I think it would bring more of her lore into the game, let people know how Orianna became the robot that she is today and personally I think it may look pretty cool. I haven&#039;t thought of a name for this skin but if you do end up doing this, please don&#039;t call it &quot;Human Orianna&quot; as that sounds not creative at all. Maybe call it &quot;Orianna Reveck&quot; as Reveck is the last name of her father &quot;Corin Reveck&quot;. This is just an idea that I personally think isn&#039;t a bad one. Please put this into consideration as it will mean a lot to me.\nIf anyone has any further ideas towards this concept, please comment below your thoughts as this will also mean a lot to me.\nThank you for time,\nKind Regards,\nSoogyDonuts (OCE)\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Corehog","date":"2016-06-25T11:28:05.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just for my understanding\n\n> Then an idea popped into my head.

What I mean is that Orianna was actually a human before she was made into the robot we know today, so they should make a skin of Orianna when she was _human. _ So not make her _look_ human but make a skin where Orianna is an _actual_ human being.
