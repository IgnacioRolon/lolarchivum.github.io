This Nunu is somehow Level 30 with less than 100 (apparently less than 50) wins. WHY IS HE ALLOWED TO PLAY RANKED!? Riot please don't let this be a thing. Introduce a system where people need like at least 100 wins to be able to play ranked. If you can't get 100 wins before getting to level 30 Then you shouldn't be able to jump straight into ranked. This is just getting out of hand.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-31T11:26:14.012+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"ADC Nunu jungle with no jungle item and Linadry's.
