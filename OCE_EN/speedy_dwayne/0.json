I&#039;m not sure whether it&#039;s server traffic that&#039;s causing such a wait, or whether some times it just takes this long. \n\nI will not close the window as instructed until I get a reply, within reason I&#039;m not going to wait for hours on end, and I hope some correspondence with a mod comes soon. \n\nThanks Riot in advance. \n\nP.S\nI can add screenshots with timestamps for proof if need be :)\n\nEDIT: the only problem I have with this is that Paypal will still charge me for the transaction if i close the window so if that isn't the case then that's all that needs to be said.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-09T03:13:59.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do not come here for a quick response.
