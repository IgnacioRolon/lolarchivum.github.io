No. That&rsquo;s garbage&hellip; AHA! Now this&hellip; this belongs in a museum.&rdquo;  Ezreal, the prodigal explorer, with the artefact in hand, stood up and wiped the sweat off his brow. \r\n&ldquo;&hellip; maybe that old man wasn&rsquo;t so crazy after all&hellip;&rdquo; Ezreal mumbled to himself as he stretched his back. He had been here for days, and to no avail. Now as he ventured deeper into this cavern, he was finally getting some results! \r\n\r\n&ldquo;My lord Ezreal! We have discovered something!&rsquo; an excited voice called out to him.\r\nEzreal grinned and sprinted in the direction of the voice.\r\n\r\n*******************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nA Demacian excavator, excitedly led him over to a site, from below, it seemed like a natural surface, but from their birds eye view looking down, Ezreal realized it was too perfect a circle, each rock formation seemed to be some form of natural rune&hellip;. as if the ground itself had taken control and locked up something.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Another one? Well anything&rsquo;s better than Krugs!&rdquo; the explorer sighed to himself.\r\n\r\nThere was definitely potential down there, who knew what treasure or knowledge was locked in there? ... But he couldn&rsquo;t shake off a foreboding feeling&hellip;\r\n\r\nAs he lifted off the final stone, there was a rumbling, the ground below them split open, and as the archaeologists, stared down at the ground, a single eye opened up and stared back at them.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Oh crap.&rdquo; \r\n\r\n*******************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nOutside the excavation site, the daily procession was underway for the emperor of Shurima. As the mighty disc rotated above him, Azir smiled to himself and reflected on how mighty and powerful ascension truly was. Beside him, Nasus and Sivir stood, Nasus, proudly standing with his king, and Sivir&hellip; looking bored. As the procession came forth, a tangled figure was seen being pulled by the soldiers.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Do you really think bonds will hold me? I will CRUSH you!&rdquo; Renekton was shaking violently in his bonds, as he glared up at his once Emperor.\r\n\r\n Azir&rsquo;s smile faded, and he rose from his throne. Raising his hand, he turned towards Renekton and called down.\r\n&ldquo;If I am unfit to rule, may the gods send down their emissary to crush me where I stand.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nSMASH\r\n\r\nThere was an enormous explosion, and turning around, Azir came eye to eye with a monstrous figure. Its body was as large as the palace itself, yet Azir felt a sudden shock at gazing into this creature&rsquo;s eye. The creature however did not share the sentiment. It turned around, and then leapt away from Shurima.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;My lord!&rdquo; Nasus ran to his side along with Sivir.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I have never seen such a creature in the tomes before.&rdquo; He pondered out loud. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;&hellip; was that ezreal I saw on its back? It must be Tuesday&hellip;&rdquo; Sivir muttered to herself.\r\n\r\n*******************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nEzreal was indeed riding the creature, albeit unwillingly. He had fired his trueshot barrage at the eye to save the soldiers, and drawn it&rsquo;s ire towards his direction&hellip;which Shurima lay behind&hellip;. Shurima and Demacia had strained relations at best, and so Ezreal, had jumped onto it and called out.\r\n&ldquo;MAKE SURE EVERYONE&rsquo;S OKAY! Time for a true display of SKILL!&rdquo;\t\r\n\r\nOn the back of this colossal creature as it forged its way through the land of runeterra. Oh. It had easily crushed the palace of Shurima. Fantastic. On the plus side though, it was now heading towards Noxus&hellip; and this wasn&rsquo;t as bad as Krugs.\r\n\r\n*******************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nSwain sat in his leather chair, and observed the babbling noxian soldier before him.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Please my lord. I&hellip;I&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t mean to do it. I assure you. I didn&rsquo;t realize that Sion was on our side I assumed&hellip;&rdquo; the man was panicking and pleading.\r\n\r\nAn axe split the mans head in half, and two spinning blades cut the mans body into quarters.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;No excuses!&rdquo; a growl from Darius.\r\n&ldquo;HAHAHA! DRRRRRAAAAAVEN!&rdquo; a cruel laugh from Draven.\r\n\r\nSighing, he stood up and turned towards the window overlooking Noxus. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Kill the rest. I have no time for this.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nDarius and Draven nodded, and left the room.\r\n\r\nSwain picked up his cane and then walked onto the balcony, observing the strength of Noxus, even deadlocked with the forces of Demacia, Ionia, the Freljord and now Shurima. They needed a power that could tip the tide of the war&hellip;.\r\n\r\nThe door of his room swung open, and a servant, panting ran in screaming.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;My lord its&hellip; its&hellip; a&hellip; Tues&hellip;!&rdquo;\r\n\r\nHe never finished his sentence.\r\n\r\nA colossal foot crushed his body, and Swain got a look at the backside of this great beast. Despite the extreme desire to annihilate the creature who had destroyed his mansion, Swain felt a sudden peace looking at the backside of the creature. \r\n\r\n&lsquo;...Tuesday...&rsquo; he idly thought to himself.\r\n\r\nThe creature took off as quickly as it came, the force of the blast annihilating another block of the city.\r\n\r\n*******************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nIt is said that on that day a shadow fell over Zaun and blocked out the sun, Urgot was able to meet a girl, date her and get her number, before the sun reappeared and he found out it was Mundo... \r\n\r\n*******************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nJinx was having a &lsquo;blast&rsquo;. She was having a nice get together of &lsquo;tea and crumpets&rsquo; with the Queen of England and the smashing Hulk. \r\n\r\nAs Caitlyn interrogated her, Vi uncharacteristically, was quiet and instead stared out the window sighing. What was wrong with her today? Was she sick? As she stared out the window, she observed the carnage of the city&hellip; wait carnage? Was it Tuesday already?\r\n\r\nAs she began to warn Caitlyn, a gigantic shadow dwarfed the city. In shock she observed the creature land, proceed to destroy half the city, and then take off again.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Hey cupcake&hellip; you know the net you use&hellip; well we&rsquo;re going to need a bigger net.&rdquo; She croaked out.\r\n\r\n*******************************************************************************************\r\n\r\n&lsquo;C&rsquo;mon you stupid creature! Fall!&rsquo; Ezreal had already suffered enough with the creature&rsquo;s ludicrous destruction, and now Cait and Vi would be on his case too. He had fired blast after blast, but it had not even tickled the creature. Now he was getting tired and they had already reached the Freljord. Only a jump away from Demacia&hellip;\r\n\r\n*******************************************************************************************\r\n\r\n&ldquo;While the three sisters fight for the land, we four will save it&hellip; Welcome to our ancient land.&rdquo; Ryze passionately spoke.\r\n&ldquo;Zis suit&hellip; it is too tight&hellip;&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Yeah well I&rsquo;m not used to *burp* wearing a shirt so suck it up.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Look Ryze I know you&rsquo;re really into this, but I don&rsquo;t think this is working.&rdquo;\r\nA volley of complaints fired at him.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Today let us hunt a creature, so feared its very name would evoke its presence. But as the most powerful warriors we will easily take it down. Its name is G&hellip;.&rsquo;&rdquo; Ryze glared at his &lsquo;team&rsquo; of warriors and proclaimed.\r\n\r\nBOOM\r\n\r\nThe warriors turned to see a gigantic creature stand proudly before them. Its mucous covered slimy skin seemed to glitter in the sunlight and it took off.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yeah, no, im not fighting that&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Zorry Ryze. I hav to feed ze poros&rdquo;\r\n\r\n*******************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nEzreal was now begging the creature to stop. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand you&rsquo;re heading towards Demacia? Just stop already!&rdquo; But it didn&rsquo;t even understand English.\r\n\r\nTuesdays were when Garen, Xin Zhao and Jarvan have their powwows, gossiping and boasting of kills and battles. Above them, Lux carefully checked the hallway outside her door, and then locked the door and proceeded to close the curtains.\r\n\r\nHowever, if she hadn&rsquo;t she may have noticed what was to come.\r\n\r\nBOOM\r\n\r\nThe three friends were blown backward, the creature&rsquo;s head now stood on level with Luxanna&rsquo;s floor, and as the curtains fell away, Ezreal, who had just managed to climb to its head saw the sight of a Lux wearing a magical girl costume with a mortified expression on her face.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Wow&hellip; ok don&rsquo;t freak out, but&hellip; it suits you!&rdquo; he called out with a thumbs up.\r\n\r\n*******************************************************************************************\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Ow ow OWWWWW&rdquo; he winced.\r\n&ldquo;Oh shut up it barely grazed you.&rdquo; Lux glared at him.\r\n\r\nSitting in the infirmary Luxanna was binding up Ezreal&rsquo;s burns. Her face was still flushed from being seen like that, but she had since forgiven him.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Well the first one maybe, but the next 50 or 60 direc&hellip; OWWW&rdquo; She slapped the burn mark on his back causing him to arch is back in pain.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;ANYWAYS&hellip; could you go one Tuesday without finding some horrific monster?&rdquo; she tiredly asked.\r\n\r\nEzreal&rsquo;s face grew serious, and thought about how right before lux had fired her first blast, the creature had exploded into billions of little green frogs which jumped off cliffs to their supposed deaths. Why? Why would a creature so strong choose to explode? \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, tomorrow&rsquo;s Wednesday. So no destruction, but that thing had a name.&rdquo; He stated.\r\n\r\nHe turned to her and grinned &ldquo;The ancients gave it it&rsquo;s name&hellip;. Gromp&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAnother average tuesday in Runeterra","replies":[]}
