Everything looks great, I like the clean look.\r\n\r\nOne of the first things I tried to do was click on the corner of the window, and drag it out to make it closer to fullscreen... I was quite surprised when I couldn&#039;t, just like in Ye Olde Client! \r\n\r\nAnwyays, I did a quick search on the forum here, I did a quick search here and found that only a few people have mentioned it - so I thought I&#039;d add to that. I&#039;d love to be able to resize the client window - and that&#039;s before discussion regarding a maximise option and the messages fitting better comes in to the equation!\r\n\r\nHopefully we can get a bit of discussion going on about it.\r\n\r\nCheers,","replies":[{"poster":"Katastrophic","date":"2016-10-14T07:06:48.316+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed, I literally just finished downloading and tried that and it didn't work.
