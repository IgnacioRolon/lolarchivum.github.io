When people being toxic to me, did I have right to fight back ? Can i get a explaination？  And did u guys, I mean Riot gives restriction to those player who always said %%%%%%%%%%% ? Our game supposed to be a national wide game， why those people who always say %%%%%%%%%%% and  never get punishment ?? Is that not belongs to Racial discrimination？Last thing is that the reason they give to my report is unsportman behavior, i didnt feed or AFK at all .   I need a explain for this thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-12-22T09:22:09.393+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about you learn how to write in good quality english (grammar and punctuation included) and then we might actually read and care.\n\nIn relation to your ban, Riot bans people for literally nothing these days, get over it, start a new account like the rest of us, or quit league, like the select few that have already","replies":[{"poster":"CooMing","date":"2017-12-22T10:30:13.021+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"interesting","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-12-22T11:19:10.426+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DarkShade918,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=tkPbBRwd,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-12-22T09:22:09.393+0000)\n>\n> How about you learn how to write in good quality english (grammar and punctuation included) and then we might actually read and care.\n> \n> In relation to your ban, Riot bans people for literally nothing these days, get over it, start a new account like the rest of us, or quit league, like the select few that have already\n\nSadly i agree entirely with your post.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LiamTheViking","date":"2018-01-27T05:19:14.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"National wide game\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"cuckboii","date":"2017-12-22T11:17:09.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry but Riot doesn't seem to care about the cause.
