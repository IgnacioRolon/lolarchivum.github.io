In one of the countless galaxies she noticed a big patch of darkness, so she fired a beautiful arrow which was covered in small charming stars. When her arrow reached the patch of darkness it exploded into a small constellation of stars to make sure that the darkness never completely took over her universe. She waited, calm and silent.\n\nThe cosmic gods responsible for managing light in the universe were active.\nXayah gently walked over the delicate stars that floated around in the enormous universe, Rakan followed her in her footsteps. Lulu hopped all over the cosmos finding stars to nurture on the way. Master Yi glided across the precious stars trying to find the quickest way to the meeting spot with Ashe. Kassadin was alone waiting to be summoned by the others, Xin Zhao protected newborn stars as he waited until everyone got there. They all needed to visit Ashe.\n\n&ldquo;You have all arrived. Welcome back,&rdquo;  greeted Ashe.\nXayah abruptly stood up and sighed &ldquo;Ashe, they are coming.&rdquo; \nAshe nodded &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be fine, we are strong,&rdquo; she said to reassure them, even if she had fears herself that they needed the right headspace. \nLulu stepped forward and pointed towards the never-ending darkness that wouldn&rsquo;t stop growing, &ldquo;What can we do Ashe?&rdquo; \n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,.&rdquo; Ashe whispered as concern filled her starry eyes. \n\n-\n\nCho&rsquo;Gath slowly walked over to another constellation, which was almost two times his size, and swallowed it whole, sighing as it did not appease his hunger.\n&ldquo;So what are you up to?&rdquo; \nCho&rsquo;Gath turned around and saw Kha&#039;Zix casually leaning against a meteor. &ldquo;Oh just the usual,&rdquo; Cho&rsquo;Gath replied. \nKha&#039;Zix laughed. &ldquo;So eating constellations is the usual for you, eh?&rdquo; Kha&#039;Zix asked with a smirk. \n&ldquo;Well I bet you couldn&rsquo;t destroy countless galaxies in just a day,&rdquo; Cho&rsquo;Gath snapped back.\n&ldquo;Sounds like a challenge between you and me,&rdquo; Kha&#039;Zix declared.\n&ldquo;Stop it you two, this won&rsquo;t get us anywhere,&rdquo; a voice said from the darkness.\n&ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s just you, Orianna,&rdquo; Kha&#039;Zix murmured. \n&ldquo;She&rsquo;s right and you both know it,&rdquo;  Thresh yelled so that he could be heard from far away. \n&ldquo;Blah blah blah, all we have to do is-&rdquo; \nThresh interrupted Kha&#039;Zix  &ldquo;Just come with Orianna and me. We need to go. Rhaast needs us.&rdquo; \n&ldquo;Whatever..&rdquo; Kha&#039;Zix whispered under his breath.\n\nJarvan was walking across the cosmos and suddenly stopped when he saw an arrow of stars exploding. He sneaked over towards it. As it formed a constellation he stared in awe.\n&ldquo;If Rhaast saw you do that he would be very disappointed,&rdquo; a voice whispered from behind him.\nJarvan whipped around and snapped &ldquo;I was only trying to figure out how to devour it, Varus.&rdquo;\n&ldquo;Oh yeah? Why not devour it now then?&rdquo; Varus said with a grin.\n&ldquo;Well I would but isn&rsquo;t there a meeting with Rhaast?&rdquo; Jarvan reminded him.\n&ldquo;Let&#039;s go then, we can destroy this later,&rdquo; Varus murmured as he walked towards the meeting place. Jarvan and Varus walked together in silence. \nJarvan spoke his mind and whispered &ldquo;I reckon we could have followed where the arrow was from, it was most likely from Ashe.&rdquo; \n&ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s true but the meeting is more important and that&rsquo;s that,&rdquo; Varus declared. Jarvan couldn&#039;t stop thinking about that constellation but he didn&rsquo;t say anything knowing that Varus would shut him down again.\n\n&ldquo;Welcome,&rdquo; a wise voice yelled from the darkness. Everyone bowed. \nCho&rsquo;Gath stepped forward and asked &ldquo;So what is happening now, Rhaast?&rdquo; \n&ldquo;We will drive them into a state of oblivion, We will devour their universe.We will destroy their whole world as they watch powerless to save anything!&rdquo; Rhaast declared. \n&ldquo;Okay, but how do we do this?&rdquo; Varus asked. &ldquo;You see we have some of the most powerful Gods but we all need to work together,&rdquo; Rhaast insisted. \nVarus laughed &ldquo;This is too simple Rhaast.&rdquo; Varus flicked his fingers and in the distance you could see what was once a planetary system was now nothing but an endless void proving that he was powerful. \n&ldquo;You are wrong Varus. Watch and you will see.&rdquo; Everyone waited and watched that very patch of darkness light up as a new constellation formed in memory of the planetary system. &ldquo;We have underestimated their power, they can reach the other side of the universe. They will not stop until the universe is balanced.  Stop being so cocky and work together,&rdquo; Rhaast snapped, directing his stare at Kha&#039;Zix. \n&ldquo;I sense that no one has any plans. That&rsquo;s fine I have one and I will brief you all about it&rdquo; Rhaast laughed &ldquo;They are getting worried, I can feel it.&rdquo; Everyone then listened to Rhaast&rsquo;s plan.\n &ldquo;I think this&rsquo;ll work. I&rsquo;m in,&rdquo; Kha&#039;Zix declared. They all agreed one by one. \nRhaast commanded &ldquo;It is settled. We leave now!&rdquo;\n\n-\n\nThey were surrounded by silence. \nAshe sighed &ldquo;We can win this easily. Last time we fought they couldn&rsquo;t work as a team -  now that is their weakness!&rdquo; \nXayah asked &ldquo;So what if they have changed since then?&rdquo;\n&ldquo;I doubt they&rsquo;d change,&rdquo; Master Yi commented. \n&ldquo;Yeah, but we need to be prepared..&rdquo; Xayah reminded him.\n&ldquo;I agree with Xayah don&rsquo;t underestimate them,&rdquo; Rakan said to back her up. \n&ldquo;We are wasting time and you all know it. Some of them are probably devouring planets or whatever they desire. We need to start a plan right now,&rdquo; Ashe said as her wise voice quivered. Everyone looked around at each other nervously. \n&ldquo;Last time there was no winner but that didn&rsquo;t change anything, they were still very powerful and they still continue to do what we hate. During that battle they had no leader.. Maybe this time they would have a leader to finally beat us once and for all,&rdquo; Xayah said anxiously. \nAshe sighed. &ldquo;Xayah you are correct, this makes it a lot different for us as I sense they have a new member -  one who is as powerful as me.&rdquo; Everyone was silent. \nXayah asked nervously &ldquo;Should we get ready?&rdquo; \nAshe replied &ldquo;No we must wait for them, they will always come to us.&rdquo; \nAs they waited Rakan and Xayah held hands and watched the beautiful galaxies swarming with life, Lulu and Ashe watched all the precious stars they had created wishing they would last forever. Kassadin and Master Yi scanned the universe as they tried to spot the enemies, and Xin Zhao stood guard near his allies protecting them even before the enemies struck.. \n\n-\n\nKha&#039;Zix commented &ldquo;This could be hard, considering they know we want to destroy their universe.&rdquo; \n&ldquo;Huh? I told you to stop being cocky but now you&rsquo;ve just lost all your confidence. Come on, we all know how many galaxies you&rsquo;ve destroyed by yourself,&rdquo; Rhaast said as he tried to get some of Kha&#039;Zixs confidence back. \n&ldquo;Well yeah.. but now that I think about it.. they are like the gods of the universe but if you say so,&rdquo; Kha&#039;Zix sighed. \nJarvan whispered &ldquo;I think I know where they are. I remember exactly where the constellation was formed so we could go from there?&rdquo; \nVarus laughed &ldquo;Have you been day dreaming again? We know where they are and we are heading there.&rdquo;  \nJarvan shook his head &ldquo;Sorry..&rdquo; \n&ldquo;Come on, this is making me think you guys aren&rsquo;t ready for this fight. I know I am. I know I can take them all on solo,&rdquo; Rhaast said confidently. \nCho&rsquo;Gath towered over the rest of the group and yelled &ldquo;We almost won once and now we have grown stronger and we can win this time. The universe will be ours!&rdquo;\n &ldquo;Well it&rsquo;ll be ours for only a short time because we will let the dark star absorb all of space and time meaning nothing will exist. Ohh how perfect!&rdquo; Orianna smiled. \n&ldquo;I see them!&rdquo; Jarvan gasped. \nOnce again Rhaast laughed &ldquo;Time for the final battle eh?&rdquo;\n\n-\n\nAshe sighed as she saw gigantic dark figures heading their way &ldquo;I see them, they are finally here.&rdquo; The cosmic gods surrounded Ashe, protecting her with their lives as she was the god of everyone and everything.\nRhaast stepped forward and yelled &ldquo;You will not win Ashe, as I am now here!&rdquo;\n&ldquo;DARK STAR WILL TAKE OVER!&rdquo; shouted all the Dark Star beings. Everyone stared each other down knowing that this could be the end of everything. \nAshe yelled back &ldquo;Cosmic will never be destroyed!&rdquo; \nThe Cosmic beings nodded and calmly vowed to never let anything happen to their universe. Rhaast walked over the gigantic meteors edging towards Ashe&rsquo;s galactic throne and with one big slash he sliced that very throne with his merciless scythe.\n&ldquo;This universe will soon be ours,&rdquo; he laughed. \nAshe&rsquo;s eyes filled with fear. She knew this was going to be hard. Rhaast was essentially as powerful as she was. \nAshe yelled at the top of her lungs &ldquo;Now we fight!&rdquo;","replies":[{"poster":"Jaytis","date":"2018-10-03T12:53:46.944+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the position you've put Ashe in {{sticker:sg-lux}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jayden","date":"2018-10-03T12:28:32.876+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow amazing{{champion:103}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rishky","date":"2018-10-02T07:48:39.051+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"WOW AMAZING STORY GOODJOB!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Anaomet","date":"2018-10-05T01:08:04.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"THATS MY VIC I LOVE IT GJ GJ GJ VJTGJVJHTGJBGFHG VERY NICE{{sticker:sg-lux}} {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
