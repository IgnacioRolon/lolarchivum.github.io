I&#039;ve never seen that skin before and I think that skin is very cool. So I asked him on how he got it and he replied &#039;not sure maybe from the shop&#039;. I checked the shop and it was not in the store. I then looked on google and it said it was given to season 1 players. So I would like to know is Judgement Kayle a really rare skin?","replies":[{"poster":"THA BAT POPE","date":"2016-05-04T04:18:44.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe I got it from playing 10 ranked games in season 1","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-05-04T01:11:10.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes its very rare, you wont be able to get it by any means sorry","replies":[]},{"poster":"Argo","date":"2016-05-03T22:00:20.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Duoing* autocorrect","replies":[]}]}
