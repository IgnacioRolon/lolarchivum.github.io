This guys attitude was pretty much guaranteeing a loss.\r\n\r\nThis was the first ranked match i have dodged in like 6 months so isn&#039;t 10 LP extreme? I thought it was meant to be 3 points for first dodge. Something like this is what is going to force me to stay in lobby with these trolls, get salty at them when they troll then dislike the game more as a result. Am i the only one this happens to? it seems like there shouldn&#039;t be such a punishment for taking the logical step and leaving a horrible lobby. \r\n\r\nCan riot please implement a dodge button for ranked games that can be pressed free of punishment once a day so that people trying to play a game can do so without the threat of trolls and the punishment involved in avoiding said trolls!","replies":[{"poster":"Slowdownn","date":"2016-05-24T01:05:55.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regarding Lp vs MMR, you need lp to rank up but MMR deferment how many points you can get from a game and so it is more important. imagine when you get to a level when winning only get you 10 points but losing will takes off 25 points, that is when you are in elo hell.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-05-23T08:14:59.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"This guys attitude was pretty much guaranteeing a loss\". There you go. 10LP is less than a loss by far. Though I have to agree I shouldn't lose LP for dodging a game when my team trolls.\n\nLike the other day in dynamic queue I picked JG, and Mid secondary. I got jg, and this guy who got top just locked in Kha'Zix, wouldn't talk, and took smite. I locked in top to be the bigger player (we lost), but I would have liked to have dodged without damaging my promos.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-05-23T09:14:24.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"i'm in promos\" is a bad excuse to not dodge, if you earned the promos, just dodge, and let your MMR (the thing that matters, your LP is a useless number) get higher.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-05-23T10:09:27.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

No it's not LP is a number you are shown to simulate changes in your ability in ranked, the actual number means nothing.\n\n2.

It is the product of all the factors that go into your ranking.\n\nIt means you get a certain amount of LP, based on performance, mmr, elo, and the outcome of a game obviously. This number doesn't MEAN nothing, it is what represents your rank. MMR is by far a better measure of your skill, but stop going around saying LP doesn't mean anything in such an ambiguous and out of context sense.\n\nThat been said, LP doesn't DETERMINE anything is what you are trying to say, it is not a dead number. It is a measurement. Also, my point here is that I shouldn't lose LP for other people's thick minded decisions. The fact that \"LP doesn't mean anything\", just doesn't make any sense.\n\nYou yourself state that MMR doesn't get effected by dodging, so your not saying anything... that is my point. I lose LP, which prevents me from ranking up, and when you say MMR is the real stat, fine, it doesn't get effected, which means I am preserving my \"real stat\", but I still need to rank up.\n\nYou are contradicting your self to the point where I have no idea what you are trying to prove.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-05-23T13:42:27.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">but I still need to rank up.\n\nI just want to cover this part really quickly, you will rank up if you continously dodge out of serie's as you will start skipping divisions/serie's by doing so, hell this is a thing that has always been useable.\n\nYour LP is a useless number, because you could easily be 3+ divisions above your rank in MMR if you dodge enough.\n\n>based on performance, mmr, elo, and the outcome of a game obviously.\n\nAs another note, your performance means nothing, win or lose is what matters.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-05-24T00:05:53.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not gonna bother reiterating myself again cause it's clear you aren't reading.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-05-24T04:03:07.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah dont bother with him tbh, he has a habit of just spitting on the posts of anyone ranked below him.\n\nHe is right in this scenario mind you regarding the mmr vs lp debate.\n\nBut his delivery as ever is cynical as fuck.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
