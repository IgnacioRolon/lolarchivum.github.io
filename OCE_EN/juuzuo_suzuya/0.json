I am a decent player and would usually make decisions for my team that would hopefully lead to victory. I try not to play super skill cap champions as the kit is usually selfish and given that i&#039;m in silver most players would be stereotypical and think i&#039;m a filthy casual, so i follow the meta and try to play a smart pick that is suitable for the team and good against theirs. But..... i normally have triggers about players that do not have the same level of intelligence as me or are not in their right mindset, given that i am in silver there is a 90% chance of me being matched with at least 2 of these in 1 game. \r\n\r\nI am actually a really nice guy in real life but in game i normally lose it as i&#039;m wasting my previous hours put in to my victories by getting defeated normally to my team. So hence i am usually toxic and let these players get to me, i even try to do /mute all at the start of the game but end up doing it again later as someone is usually spamming pings at me. So recently i was banned for 14 days due to toxic behavior, and reflecting on my previous behaviors i believe i can improve myself but i don&#039;t think it will change... if this keeps up i will be per ma banned!!!! how do i improve myself.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-07-19T13:57:04.439+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You sound like my spirit animal haha.\n\nHeres what worked for me (till i moved house and it ruined pretty much all of it)\n\nMusic, preferably something that will pump you up and keep you motivated.\n\nTry to play during the hours of the day that children are still in school, it sounds stupid but in general i gained an extra 10-20% on my winrate in the last 20 games when i did that (yes even reaching 100% winrates at times) if you are playing after or before school hours you are basically going to get some 15 year old shitstain in your games who is just gonna shit all over you.\n\nFind something to keep you calm while you play, for me it was smoking (cant smoke in this house this is where it mostly fell apart for me) drinking works for me too but is far more expensive, but for you it might be food or something else anything that just clears your head.","replies":[]},{"poster":"freebase","date":"2016-07-22T03:16:08.575+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"&%#$ riot for these 2 week bans they give us. \nFor them to ban players like luffy and me after the amount of time and money we spend on this game is ridiculous.\nIm so mad that i got banned for trolling a guy who trolled me first.\nGet *&%#@$ riot!! \nthat 2 week ban put me off the game i dont play nearly as much as i used too \nand i wont be spending any more money here.\ntheres absolutely nothing wrong with our behaviour.\nwe can do wtf we want to jus like everyone else.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ErÃ¸se","date":"2016-07-20T04:52:20.170+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all you should not pick the \"meta\" picks just because it is suitable for the team, I reckon you should play champions that you are most comfortable with and like to play as it gives your team a higher chance of winning. It works like this:   You are comfortable with a champion> You Win Lane > You Snowball really hard or you gank other lanes to help them get ahead as well> the more fed you are the more threat you are>More objectives because the enemy is afraid to fight you> win the game.\n\n\nAs you play a suitable pick for your team and you are not really familiar with that champion you will most likely end up feeding and losing the lane and what i said above would be what the enemy would be doing to your team. I was bronze 3 and i played champions that I felt like suited our team comp but later on I started playing champions that I was really comfortable with and started carrying and now i'm at silver 3 80lp.\n\n\nAlso you should only stick to 1 to 2 roles and not constantly switch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-07-19T12:03:31.617+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, good to hear you're enjoying League :D\n\n> I'll try my best to help you out with your problem, but TBH it doesn't seem like solo queue is the best place for someone like you. \n> \n> You're into shot-calling (decision making), you like strategic meta play, and you work best with smart team. It sounds to me like being a captain of a Ranked Team is your true calling! The [Ranked Teams Queue](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/competitive/ranked-5s-queue-returns-during-scheduled-windows) was just re-enabled in OCE recently so it might be worth trying out.\n\n_Anyway, here's four tips to help you out with your issue:_\n\n+ **Find different ways to vent toxicity**\n I think everyone can reform themselves, but since your next ban will be **permanent**, I think it's best we focus on a quick solution first.\n\n **Trick2g** is the absolute god at venting toxicity away from chat. He knows he's toxic, so he found really creative ways to get around it. Here's a few of his techniques with links to examples:\n\n - [_\"Tilt Dolphin\"_](https://youtu.be/ygFpdnc2dmc?t=4m9s) and the [_\"Tyler1 mannequin\"_](https://youtu.be/ygFpdnc2dmc?t=2m4s) are two props that he violently assaults when he's tilted. You could use a [stress ball](http://www.ebay.com/itm/6-3CM-Basketball-Hand-Wrist-Exercise-Stress-Relief-Squeeze-Soft-Foam-Ball-SE-/131864682653?hash=item1eb3bf609d:g:hTsAAOSw3ihXTXCm) as something similar for yourself.\n\n - [Shouting at the screen and illegible chat.](https://youtu.be/bLXkKL9xjME?t=1m3s) This one is classic trick2g, he'll always shout some insult at the screen and then slam his hand on they keyboard to type _\"ghtfvcgbnyhhujyuijkhyhuijkuhuk\"_ in chat. \n\n   You can also just mutter under your breath like me, or just comment casually on their failure if shouting isn't your thing. The most important thing is that you do not actually type it in chat! :)\n\n+ **Remove your chat**\nThe report system has been known to become really harsh after players receive a 14 day ban. So it's super important we don't let even the slightest bit of toxicity slip. I'd use this option if you're worried you won't be able to control yourself.\n\n Here's how it's done (if you're having trouble ask me to make a video tutorial for you):\n\n - Go to your Riot Games folder, then League of Legends, then Config.\n - Find a file called \"PersistedSettings\" and open it in notepad.\n - Use the shortcut _Ctrl + F_ and type _\"Scale\"_\n - The chatscale should be a positive number currently. Change it to _\"-150.0000\"_\n\n+ **Don't play on tilt**\n It might seem like a good idea to play League after a bad day at work, or get one more game in during a big loss streak, but this is when you're most likely to severely flame.\n\n Watch a stream instead or go relax with some netflix. The biggest lie you can tell yourself is that you're not tilted at all. You're probably closer to a breaking point than you think. It's top priority to avoid playing League at all costs when you're like this!!! Once you get in game, it's going to be really hard to keep your cool if something goes wrong.\n \n\n+ **Other stuff**\n Dynamic Queue can be great if you duo with a good friend. It'll make the experience more fun and lower your chances of getting a tilted player.\n\n Music can be relaxing for some players as well. You've probably already given it a shot, but it will be a combination of all these tips that stops you from flaming again. Everything helps a little.\n\nThis post is already super long so I'll cut it short here. But I've still got a few more up my sleeve so feel free to ask for any more help. \n\nBest of luck man, I hope you can get back on the Rift soon ;)","replies":[]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-19T11:19:12.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know the feeling bro because I have been chasing the same level of results and wanting rewards for my hard work and improvement. The sad truth is you can't force it. For some people it will naturally progress and momentum will take over until broken. For others it will be a long hard grind even over a few years. I highly suggest you just simply let go of the expectations you have towards others in game and the results you \"should\" be getting. Not only will that free you up mentally to concentrate on just doing the best you can in what you control but, it will also allow you reap the rewards of the wins but not the disappointment when it doesn't go you're way. Keep in mind there is a thin line between caring about the results and you're team doing well but not having the expectation that it should go a certain way. If you can find that balance I can almost guarantee that you will find a lot more success even where you would otherwise think there is none. This may or may not answer you're question but I hope it helps either way.","replies":[]}]}
