That is a whole other level for me.\n\nTotally using it would be only efficient with high scaling adc like kog as mentioned, i never really put thought into how its effects towards support type though.\n\nThanks for input, if i ever come across it in game, hope i can perform better with being able to anticipate!","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-09-15T01:04:08.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they hold on to it, because why sell it? It generates gold per second, so you only sell it when you need the last itemslot, and that generally means only when you have enough gold to outright buy a bloodthirster or armour pen item as your last buy. Not many progames last long enough for an adc to hit 6 items, and during midgame the survivablity it offers is pretty decent.","replies":[{"poster":"Avago ya mug","date":"2017-09-15T02:56:33.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The outright buy an item is what was on my mind, i was wondering if they had enough for  say a B.F sword would they ditch the relic and buy the B.F or wait till can buy the full item build they are after such as a bloodthirster. \nNot sure but i feel it is a dangerous choice, giving it would be late game and enemy could have the extra damg from a B.F sword whilst you holding onto the relic awaiting the full item. but i guess this is where the 350 non decay shield comes into play.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-09-15T06:11:24.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"earlygame the extra 40ad is huge, in small lane 2v2 fights that extra ad is a huge dynamic, but later on into the game, teamfights and positioning and the presence of engage threats, assassins, mages, ect.. despite the fact that with crit/atkspeed, ad is more amplified, pure dps matters alot less when you consider all these factors, thus the extra durability, ends up being worth almost as much, and the relic shields extra gold will help it's adc hit those final items first.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
