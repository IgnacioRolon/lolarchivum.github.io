NOTHING that is all i get, never any help from riot staff or explanation of any sort. So i decided to just get a whole new PC, thinking maybe there is an issue with my pc. New PC everything updated on it, only  thing i had done was installed League of legends. Guess what same old shit keeps happening, disconnection from pvp.net, halfway through a game it will disconnect and will not reconnect. \r\nThen i get a notice about checking out possible problem as the game has detected issues or something of sorts, mostly links to WINDOWS 7 crap, seriously who the funk is still running windows 7? I may sound mad and that is because i&#039;am! i now AGAIN face penalty for AFK due to this constant disconnecting issues, reasons not caused by my own faults!  EVEN after trying to seek out help from the staff and never getting responses, this game is dying and is pretty much dead to me now!\r\nI enjoyed playing don&#039;t get me wrong, i have been playing since late S1 on the NA server. but not its just fkd!","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-01-14T08:57:37.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nI took a glance at your post history and I see no prior threads from you relating to this issue, are you sure you posted on the OCE boards?\n\nAnyway, on the subject of your connection problems;\n\nCould you do the following for me,\n\n* [Switch to a public DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5)\n* [Download WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download) and run a traceroute to the following IP.
