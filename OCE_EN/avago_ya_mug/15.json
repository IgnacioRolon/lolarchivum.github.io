As after few weeks it will randomly just start to happen again, only been getting this issue the last few months.\r\n\r\nI have tried doing a client troubleshooting for problems and full repair and this does not stop the problem, it is only when I fully uninstall the game.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else encountered such an issue? Or any idea what maybe going wrong, thoughts would be appreciated!","replies":[]}
