In normals and flex queue you will have a gold border, but in solo/duo queue you will have a silver one.\n\nOn a related note, you get the rewards relevant to your highest rank (though each queue usually has it's own icon), so even if you only get get gold in one queue you will still get the skin.","replies":[]}]}
