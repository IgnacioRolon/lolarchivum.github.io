This is not a nerf, nor a buff. Not a single number here changes in value, aside from rounding. So why bother?\r\n\r\n* It is more transparent, as this means for example that a 10% buff to a ghoul base damage IS ACTUALLY a 10% buff to a ghoul base damage.\r\n\r\n* It also gives Riot the ability to independently change their AD scaling WITHOUT touching their base damage. For example, this allows them to reward Yorick for building AD, without handing tank Yorick free damage, thus letting them balance them independently.\r\n---\r\n\r\nBasically, the following two lists are identical.\r\n\r\nCurrent Formula\r\n\r\n[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,14,20,26,32,48,44,55,66,77,88,99] + 30% Total AD\r\n\r\nvs\r\n\r\nEquivalent Formula\r\n\r\n[21,23,26,28,31,33,36,43,51,58,66,73,81,93,106,118,131,143] + 30% Bonus AD.\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe same thing can be applied (and always could be) applied to their health, for the following conversion:\r\n\r\n[100,105,110,115,120,125,130,135,140,145,150,165,170,175,180,185] + 15% maximum health\r\n\r\n[187,207,227,247,267,287,307,327,347,367,387,407,427,447,467,487,507,527] +15% bonus health\r\n\r\nWhich is again more transparent, and allows them to tweak scaling without touching base.\r\n---\r\n\r\nMathematical proof for those who care.\r\n\r\nx + 30% total\r\n\r\n= x + 30% base + 30% bonus\r\n\r\n= (x + 30% base) + 30% bonus\r\n\r\n= y + 30% bonus, where y\r\n\r\n= (x + 30% base)\r\n\r\nSo x is the first array, and y is the second array.","replies":[{"poster":"ClickClack472","date":"2018-12-13T12:01:18.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You lost me at maths","replies":[]}]}
