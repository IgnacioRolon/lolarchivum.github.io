Now I&#039;m not sure what is best to do; buy 3 champion shards and reroll them or buy all 4800 champs and then start rerolling to get 6300 champs. Due to Shards only costing 1700 if I get 3 shards its 5100, so just over 4800 but I also need 6300 champs so mathematically can somebody tell me which would be more efficient to do please. I currently need 11 6300 champs and 10 4800 champs. So I&#039;m puzzled on what to do. Someone do the maths for me please.","replies":[]}
