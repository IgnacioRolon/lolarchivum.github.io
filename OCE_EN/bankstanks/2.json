It takes ages and nothing happens so I close League then log back in and try reconnect. I get an error message saying that I can&#039;t connect although my internet is working fine. It tells me to retry or cancel I continually try retry then close reopen League rinse and repeat. So I log back on after a few tries and it says I have been put into low priority queue for 5 games for leaving. So I&#039;m suffering for Riots servers??? I want this fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-06-19T09:01:14.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When Riot's servers are to blame, you'll likely see Loss Forgiven enabled and no LPQ. However, what you're describing is likely an ISP issue, which caused connection issues for you. LPQ isn't applied to accounts on first offenses, which also means that you've left a game lately. However, LPQ goes down pretty quickly, so if you're not encountering any issues that may prevent you from playing the game, you should be all good!\n\nFor more information about LeaverBuster, check out the support article:\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ","replies":[]}]}
