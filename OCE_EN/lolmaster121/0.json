I am just asking if you could please put up a more recent version of League of Legends on your signup page because my client is quite faulty and very often I need to delete it and reinstall it again and everytime I do so I have to go your website and download a very old version which I then have to update and the update is usually about 5GB and usually takes about 6 hours. my wifi is quite slow and I can only use 15GB a month so im just asking you for this favour so that I can continue to play League of Legends.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-02-11T10:16:38.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThe file you retrieve from the download page is merely the tool to;\n\n* Install all prerequisites for the game\n* Install the patcher\n\nThe patcher is the tool that downloads all the necessary resources for the game, were these to be available via a direct download you would still need to download the same total filesize that the patcher would retrieve.","replies":[]}]}
