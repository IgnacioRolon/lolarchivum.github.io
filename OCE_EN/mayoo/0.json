Its nothing special and probably has been thought of. But how cool would it be to see/watch a 1st person view of different characters. And could also make a game of it where you have to guess each one. I know it would take some time and effort to do, but have to admit it would be pretty cool :D. \r\nThanks for Reading :D","replies":[{"poster":"ForPortal","date":"2015-02-14T18:04:49.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they made one, a stealth champion would probably work best. Something like a Teemo's eye view of him sneaking around being a constant thorn in the side to the people trying to squish the little rat.","replies":[]}]}
