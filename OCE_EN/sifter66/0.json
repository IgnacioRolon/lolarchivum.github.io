I feel that these tiers are not necessary for League of Legends anymore, as players are very unlikely to use them now, especially after the removal of the Rune Combiner, if you recall, a long time ago. With the Rune Combiner removed, players will not be able to dispose of their lesser tier runes and they will prove absolutely no use to them in the future. I propose that all Tier One and Two runes be removed from the game and, thus, Tier 3 Runes will be the only runes. Because of this, Tier 3 runes will no longer need to be called &quot;Greater Runes&quot;, but simply &quot;Runes&quot;, such as &quot;Mark of Attack Damage&quot;, not &quot;Greater Mark of Attack Damage&quot;. To support my statement a little further, in older champion spotlight videos, Phreak would only specify the runes he would recommend and not the tier itself. Rune prices may or may not need to be adjusted, but that is entirely up to Riot. Please consider this, as players would really enjoy this change and, therefore, the experience with League of Legends. Also, instead of level 20, Tier 3 Runes should be available at level 15. It seems fair.","replies":[{"poster":"best nice oce","date":"2015-06-11T07:27:46.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree. It's easier to win games on a low level account if you spend a few hundred/thousand IP on tier 1/2 runes.\nOnly thing I want to see changed with the runes is being able to get rid of them. Even if you couldn't refund them, just remove them. My main has 10 flat MR glyphs because of the rune combiner, and I've got a bunch of other runes (like lifesteal qunits and scaling ad marks) that I haven't used for years. That being said I'm no where near the max amount you can have (300 I think??), but I still think that'd go well with the community.\n\nDon't know why you would want to remove runes though. They give a small boost to low level accounts.","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-06-11T08:32:41.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually think the max is 700+ to compensate for the removal of the rune combiner.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-06-11T23:46:40.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought you could combine runes to change them e.g. T = Tier(2X T1 runes = a different T1 rune - 2X T2 runes = a different T2 rune - 2X T3 runes = a different T3 rune) (also 5X T1 runes = a different T2 rune - 5X T2 runes = a different T3 rune )","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-06-12T01:44:53.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They removed the Rune Combiner in Preseason 5 bro.
