I don't need that from ANYONE.\nOnce the match ended, I was just glad to be out of there - but in doing so I forgot to report them in the post-match window, and I don't know how else to do it.\nThey're on my block list now (along with their friend who commented how \"salt\" we were), which is a start I guess. But I don't want to have to deal with this *at all*, and because I %%%%ed up and didn't report it kinda feels like they got away with it.\n\nI play for fun, but when I play a match and feel worse afterwards than before I began... what's the point?","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-06T22:58:32.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reporting players for abusive language should be done in game, not on the boards.
