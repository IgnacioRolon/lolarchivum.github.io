Why? Because Riot places unranked players in Silver 1 games. I assume this is because there are so many smurf accounts around, but this makes for a really bad experience.","replies":[{"poster":"Best Evelynn OCE","date":"2018-03-13T09:21:32.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I quite like the system other MOBAs use, in that everyone starts in Bronze V and you have to work your way up.\n\nThere are also other MOBAs that base your starting MMR in Ranked off your Normal's MMR.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-03-25T12:18:25.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Best Evelynn OCE,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=EYtA0mAq,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-03-13T09:21:32.546+0000)\n>\n> I quite like the system other MOBAs use, in that everyone starts in Bronze V and you have to work your way up.\n> \n> There are also other MOBAs that base your starting MMR in Ranked off your Normal&#x27;s MMR.\n\nAgree with this. Start everyone in Bronze V. If you're good enough, you will climb. If you're a shitter you'll remain in low elo and won't mess up other people's games as much.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sulbatamol","date":"2018-03-24T01:24:19.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ur lucky because I have toto start off as silver 3 because of shit players.

Play two games in High Silver. From there you either go up to Mid Gold or low Silver for two games. Then you move up and down depending until you are equalled out.\n\nSo, if I were a Noob at the game, I may go: Silver 1 > Silver 5 > Bronze 3 > Bronze 5.\n\nOr if I were a Challenger Smurf, I would go: Silver 1 > Gold 3 > Gold 1 > Platinum 3 > Platinum 1 or Diamond 5.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-14T10:21:58.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your MMR is high enough you can skip divs currently (I skipped G4 just last month), but I gather you're talking more about fresh accounts.\n\nI'm inclined to agree there should be some kind of exaggerated MMR gains/losses for fresh accounts. As it is, a truly new player who plays a whole heap of games to 30 in a week or two is still going to barely know anything about the game, and is going to feed hard on the way down from their fresh mid Silver MMR, while a smurf is going to stomp a whole lot of games on the way up.\n\nI feel like placements were designed to mitigate that, but as the game has evolved it's no longer really sufficient. Personally I feel either some exaggeration of your MMR through placement, or some cues taken from your normal MMR (or both) is the way to go. \n\nYou'll still have outliers of course for people that don't play a lot of normals, or for smurfs who just played random entirely non meta picks to level for fun and so on, but generally speaking I would the the majority of fresh accounts would be placed much closer to their actual skill.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-03-13T07:10:29.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didnt think it was as high as silver 1, I thought it was low-mid silver, which corresponds to the midpoint of LoL population by volume.\n\nI think there are definitely arguments for and against. Throwing a sample of 100 players in at S3, 49 will climb, 49 will fall, and 2 will stay put (gross simplification, but yeah).\n\nIf you throw 100 in bronze 5, 10 will stay put, and 90 will definitely climb, and of that 90, 50 will likely be above S3 level and will have to go all the way through every bronze tier to get to S3 and beyond. In a way this seems fair, but it also destroys any fighting chance of anyone in B5 looking to climb to B3 because they're just gonna get stomped.\n\nIf you throw 100 in Plat, 1 will stay there, and 99 will fall.\n\nI think it is just a numbers thing - population distributed as a bell curve by volume has a mid point around S3.\n\nhttps://www.leagueofgraphs.com/rankings/rank-distribution/oce","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-03-13T07:52:05.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you'd probably get better results dumping them in bronze 1 though. Your average 'legitimate, fresh lvl30' new player is generally high bronze skill level.\n\nI also feel the reason riot uses Silver 1 as baseline is that for the few players that don't play very much, it makes it easier to hit gold5 and be satisfied with their rank, and it also helps create a disparity for the really bad players so that they can more quickly be placed in the appropriate rank, since high silver/low gold games are typically more stable than bronze games, hence smaller differences in skill level are easy to disparate than in bronze snowball fiesta, where you need a large sample size to determine individual player skill and not just game variance.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-03-13T08:17:37.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fair points.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
