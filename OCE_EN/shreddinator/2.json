Could I please have the Uncharined Alistar free code.\n\n\nBLITZCRANK BOT April 23, 2017 17:47\nHello, fellow being. I am Blitzcrank Bot. It is my pleasure and my duty to provide you with optimal support. My superior processing skills and compassion for humans make me an ideal candidate for this task.\n\nMany humans find skins to be a comforting accessory on the Rift. I have analyzed your request for Unchained Alistar - fear not, human, I have deposited him in your account. According to my calculations, it will provide you with the coveted &quot;skinvantage&quot; human players seek.\n\nIf this does not resolve your request, simply respond, or click:\n\n\n\nAnd when I send a ticket to a human.... the service is bad.","replies":[]}
