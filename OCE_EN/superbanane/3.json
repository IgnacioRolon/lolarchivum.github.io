If that doesn't work try the following.\n\n> 1. Restart your computer again to ensure nothing related to League of Legends is running.\n2. Go to your Riot Games folder. (Usually C:\\Riot Games)\n3. Open \"League of Legends\" then \"RADS\" then \"Projects.\"\n4. Delete the \"lol_patcher\" folder.\n5. Try launching League of Legends as admin again.\n\n\nLet me know if it works.","replies":[{"poster":"Alphatrick","date":"2016-02-10T06:29:34.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"works now thanks","replies":[]}]}]}
