Every time i try to log on, any account, a popup appears saying &quot;Did not receive a response from the servers, retrying, 1, 2, 3&quot;. Then it stops after the 3rd attempt and i cannot log on. My league client was working perfectly fine before the patch and the patch seemed to update fine. I&#039;ve already uninstalled and reinstalled League, tried solutions on other posts. I cannot try the Internet Explorer method as i do not have IE, used to have Microsoft Edge but that is gone too. I have uninstalled Pandora Media Booster. I am using wired connection.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-13T07:38:23.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCould you please run the [ICSI netalyzr](http://netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/) for me and post back with a link to your results?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stigma","date":"2016-03-13T00:50:53.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stigma","date":"2016-03-12T17:07:14.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]}]}
