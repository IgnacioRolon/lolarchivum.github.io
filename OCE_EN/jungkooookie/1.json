She has utility, and still has that 'sit back and set up a tent in my lane' feel that Heimerdinger has. If your team is a poke comp, then Lulu is good. However, if you want to shut down your lane opponent, try picking up champs like Renekton and Xin Zhao.\n\nJust a 3 year top lane main trying to help someone out.","replies":[{"poster":"Jungkooookie","date":"2016-02-07T02:25:50.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!
