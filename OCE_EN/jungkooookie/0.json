I'd recommend buying it on a weekend, when you know you'll have lots of time to use it.\n\n+ Play Twisted Treeline when it's available on Thursday to Saturday after 3:00pm. I've heard it grants the most XP and IP relative to game time.\n\n+ Play bots! You'll be able to play far more bot games in 1 hour than normal games. There's only a 10% decrease in XP for levels 20 - 29.\n\n It's a great alternative to normals, when you want something casual or don't have as much time.\n\nOther than that, just keep playing your favorite game-modes heaps!","replies":[{"poster":"Jungkooookie","date":"2016-02-08T07:38:16.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Summmoner!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-02-09T02:38:04.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just curious... don't u need to own like 16 heroes to join the ranked game?","replies":[]},{"poster":"WE WUZ KINGZ","date":"2016-02-07T04:56:13.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"play intermediate coop vs AI with xp boost.
