I&#039;ve played in America server as well and I just feel like people don&#039;t talk shit as much as OCE player does, especially those silver people: \r\n\r\nfor example:  you banned the champ he want in draft mode (this happened to my friend when he was in silver), the player who&#039;s champ was banned by his teammate, just start to abuse my friend, saying horrible things throughout the entire game, in the game I feed the first blood accidentally, that player just turned on me and saying how to suck I am. I told him to STFU and he just comes top and feeds the enemy top laner.\r\n\r\nanother example: I asked for the top in champ select, and I just chose riven with the spellbook so I can change to smite, what happened next was fucking insane, our support ADC and top all come to the top with me and feed like bronze players, when I was 2/1 level 7 my teammate was level 3 Kayel and AFK, level 4 Anivia... at the end they just stay in the base and blaming everyone\r\n\r\nBelow gold in OCE was hell, you play games, 50% of the time you will be mad or tilt after the game, any way to solve this?","replies":[{"poster":"Joiksu","date":"2018-02-06T06:45:33.358+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I had a Bard the other day who was doing the stupid low elo OCE thing of walking out of lane, missing experience, leaving his adc in a 1 v 2 situation, to get meeps deep in the enemy jungle while no lane has priority. Of course he got caught out and as he was running to my lane, and died, decided to flame me for not helping him, when I actually did try to.\nBeing myself, I don't take kindly to those that blame others for their own mistake, so i promptly told him to take responsibility for your own mistake. So what did he do?\nStarted spiteful behaviour by walking into the top lane, taking my cs and feeding.\n\nBut yeah, trolls are not punished, so kids keep doing it. These punk arse kids who thinks they are entitled to everything without a shred of responsibility live in OCE.","replies":[{"poster":"Cowsep Master Yi","date":"2018-02-11T03:02:23.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot really need to think about how to make the punishment fair for players now","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-06T12:13:02.971+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"OCE does tend to be a bit more lenient on language than other regions, and generally speaking it's a cultural difference. That said, straight up being an asshole is still not ok.\n\nPeople starting toxicity always sucks, especially when it's over the tiniest mistake, and the best thing you can do is report them in post game, or through a support ticket if you dodge the lobby (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Post game is always going to better, but sometimes it just isn't possible.\n\nRanked is always going to be a more volatile environment as well, especially in the lower ranks where people can often feel stuck. This is no excuse of course, it simply heats things up a bit. That said, firing back is never a good idea, and doesn't make you any better than the guy that fired first. If someone is being toxic, mute and report at the end of the game. You not seeing them being an asshole doesn't mean you can't report it, and doesn't mean they won't be punished for it.\n\nIt's also worth noting that just being a bad player isn't an offence in the eyes of the punishment system. It sucks to be matched with people who have no idea what they're doing, but they will drop to where they should be in time. Especially in the lower ranks as well, players are *very* inconsistent. Someone can solo carry one game then hard feed the next, often because they don't know how to play from behind or are just missing a key mechanic which leaves a gaping hole in their play for the enemy to exploit.\n\nTilt and toxicity exist at every level of play, and the best thing you can do is report the behaviour. If there is no report, the game is not reviewed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jèongyeon","date":"2019-02-19T12:22:53.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have u heard about our server, Garena Philippines server. have fun playing with literally 9 year olds. literelly kids.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-02-06T18:56:54.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But how would you know what above gold in oce is like Michael :) your highest was silver 2 :)","replies":[{"poster":"Cowsep Master Yi","date":"2018-02-11T02:58:36.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i've played in gold games and plat games before : )","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-02-11T04:27:23.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No you haven’t Michael","replies":[{"poster":"Cowsep Master Yi","date":"2018-02-17T05:10:15.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"actually i played a lot lmfao","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-02-12T06:55:00.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cowsep Master Yi,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=i2in7lI8,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2018-02-11T02:58:36.377+0000)\n>\n> i&#x27;ve played in gold games and plat games before : )\n\nI have games of ARAM filled with plats, diamonds and even master from time to time.

Like others standing behind me, not attacking the enemy, while I was fighting them, just so they could KS, as I was building tank with low damage).\n\nThey all reported me at the end, but nothing will happen.
