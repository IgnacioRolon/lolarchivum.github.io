Like, Riot can  just make it  refresh every day at 12 o&#039;clock,so it gives us time to lost, the first win of the day mission now was very hard to let us follow up the exact time of the mission, it will get later and later every day until one day that we couldn&#039;t complete it on time and that case we have to do it in the next day.\r\n\r\nOverall I just strongly recommend that you should change the first win of the day mission to make it refresh every day at 12 o&#039;clock, or 3 o&#039;clock things like this. I believe most League players agree with me on this.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-25T02:35:38.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as I know it refreshed every 20 or 22 hours instead of 24 to allow for just this.","replies":[{"poster":"Cowsep Master Yi","date":"2018-02-06T01:45:39.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you sure about that?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-06T03:29:51.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> This bonus is set to a 20 hour cycle/reset as opposed to a calendar day.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752824#h5","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BarneyIsComing","date":"2018-01-24T09:17:28.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"24 hours  = 1 day","replies":[]}]}
