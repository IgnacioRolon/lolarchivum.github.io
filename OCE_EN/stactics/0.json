Sure placing lower makes sense but not two whole devisions","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-01-21T08:41:25.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ranked is a soft reset. So you almost ALWAYS end up lower than where you were. Now had you done that well on a brand new unranked account you probably would have gotten higher. Pushing mid to high gold with 9-1.\n\nI dont know why anyone below Plat are complaining anyway. Riot added the new \"promo helper\" thing anyway so most people will be high silver to gold within a few months","replies":[]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-01-21T04:54:37.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Silver 2 S5 to Bronze 1 S6 here\n#RektTheBronzes #mwahaha","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-01-21T04:48:48.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you must have had bad mmr","replies":[]}]}
