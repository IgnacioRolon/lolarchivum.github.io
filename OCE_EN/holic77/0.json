I made an NA account and can connect to Na just fine though. Every time on OCE it just says connection failure unable to connect to the pvp.net server. I had downloaded the game three or four days before the patch and had been able to play again fine but after patching it I always get this error. I had tried repairing, re downloading and giving it a fresh install. I have tried some fixes from https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761944-Login-Issues and https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664 with nothing helping in anyway. Nothing had really changed on my end overnight before the patch to really case anything to be conflicting with logging in. I had tried sending a support ticket with dxdiag, process list, network analysis and network info log but it has been four days already with no reply.","replies":[]}
