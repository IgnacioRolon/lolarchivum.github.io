It just says: connection failure unable to connect to the pvp.net server. My friend seems to be able to get on just fine but I can&#039;t. I tried making another account quick and I can&#039;t with that one either same thing. I tried making a third on the NA server and it works fine. It directs me to https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761944 and I had tried all of them and none work. Tried reinstalling, no change. I only started playing again a few days ago so the download files I have are pretty fresh, it&#039;s just this patch I guess. Using windows by the way.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-07-24T08:58:05.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey holic77, \n\nCan you make sure that you've added League of Legends as an exception to any firewalls/antivirus applications that you may have running? \n\nOtherwise, please try the solutions in the following two Riot Games Support articles: \n- [Login Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761944-Login-Issues)\n- [Troubleshooting Connection Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664)","replies":[{"poster":"holic77","date":"2015-07-24T12:46:01.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Already did, like I said.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-07-24T16:55:52.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you also done the Troubleshooting Connection Issues?","replies":[{"poster":"holic77","date":"2015-07-25T01:06:07.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
