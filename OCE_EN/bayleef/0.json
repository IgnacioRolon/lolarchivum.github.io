As a mid laner main its hard when youre 6 slotted with a QSS and you really wanted to keep it but theres no ap with it. Im just thinking you have to either Keep QSS or sell it and buy another item. If there was an AP item that QSS built into you could keep QSS. Sadly theres only QSS for AD.","replies":[{"poster":"Jayhawk","date":"2014-12-19T01:56:04.848+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"And there's no AD version of Zhonya's hourglass, it's because the ability to use an item like that is too beneficial to a character of that style, what's the common counter to most assassins? Hard CC, QSS removes at least one hard cc and most teams blow several in a row so you can get out of an assassin's biggest counter if this item were to exist.\n\nWhat would benefit an AD character in a fight? The ability to go invulnerable for 2.5 seconds with no real repercussions outside of not maintaining their damage so that they don't get killed by assassins getting to the back-line.","replies":[{"poster":"Mazzz","date":"2014-12-19T02:53:32.569+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That^\nIt takes more skill to use a zhonyas effectively on Katarina than Qss. This is because without cc, a fed Kat can 100 to 0 an entire team without counterplay.\nZhonyas requires timing and reaction time to certain cc. Also it makes more sense on casters as they dont have such consistent damage, meaning that extra 2.5 seconds contributes to cooldown time.","replies":[{"poster":"Bayleef","date":"2014-12-21T04:34:21.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2014-12-21T08:00:57.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"who says you cant get zonyas on AD champs? or QSS on AP champs?\n\nthe biggest thing there is QSS doesnt need to be upgraded to get a full benefit. and AD isnt even a wasted stat on some AP champs. Eg kat loves AD.","replies":[]}]}
