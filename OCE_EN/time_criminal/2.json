But it was really toxic and I screenshot it at the time and I was wondering how I could report them now? Also would they still get banned if they were toxic a decent chunk of time ago?","replies":[{"poster":"Bronze 6 Yasuo","date":"2017-11-01T05:13:58.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You canâ€™t.

They will forward the ticket to the Player Behaviour team who will then review the case and *should* take appropriate action. From what I understand, there's no \"time limit\" on players being punished for behaviour, though it may be more difficult to address the situation the more time passes, and I may be wrong on that (I'll see if I can get confirmation).","replies":[{"poster":"Time Criminal","date":"2017-11-01T03:25:40.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-11-01T03:04:25.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support ticket - Report a player","replies":[]}]}
