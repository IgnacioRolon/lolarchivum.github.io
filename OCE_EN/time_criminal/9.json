This isn&#039;t more of that. In this post I&#039;m suggesting that the new client supports Chinese and Korean. In the client settings you can change it to all the languages that other regions have (Japanese, Spanish, etc) but Chinese and Korean aren&#039;t available here, and on lots of the tutorials on how to do these changes, people want Chinese/Korean. So I was wondering if anyone else would be keen to at least get these languages supported on the new client.\r\n-----\r\nI&#039;m also going to be posting this on the NA boards, on the hopes people notice it.","replies":[{"poster":"CowManCallum","date":"2017-11-08T09:34:08.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want to play in Korean or Chinese then go to the Chinese or Korean Servers.\n\nThe client might be able to handle it, but I remember there was a definite reason that those two in particular weren't enabled.
