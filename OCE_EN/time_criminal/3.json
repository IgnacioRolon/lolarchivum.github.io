I&#039;ve been looking at them and wanting to make one like it for a while now, but I&#039;ve got no idea how. So does anyone know the program they use, and have any tutorials for the type of art they do? \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nP.S: I know they made art spotlights a while ago, I&#039;m not talking about those for a few reasons.\r\n1) They&#039;re old\r\n2) There just a time-lapse of them from a starting drawing/image already, and I&#039;d prefer a tutorial.","replies":[{"poster":"Tomblade","date":"2017-06-28T01:44:58.507+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Time Criminal!\n\nLord Sesshomaru is right! Though the art team uses a variety of tools, Photoshop is a core when it comes to splash art. You would definitely need a drawing tablet or something though unless you are a GOD with a mouse :P You can find a lot of tutorials on Youtube by other artists just search up \"digital painting\" to get started.\n\nIf you've already got some drawing skills, you will definitely pick it up faster. If you're new to illustration, my advice is to invest more time into pencil+paper first.\n\nBeyond that, most of (if not all) the animated splash arts for login screens/screensavers etc are made with Adobe AfterEffects. If you want to learn about that, search \"AfterEffects puppet\" in Youtube.\n\n:)","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-07-01T20:08:04.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy moly, the puppet tool is pretty legit!
