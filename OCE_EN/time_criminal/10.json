Along with regular 5v5 games, ASE will feature some fun game modes and a 1v1 tournament, putting pros in unique situations to really test their skills for your personal enjoyment.\n\nAs for voting on who gets to go to All-Stars:\n> You get to decide! And you're not just voting for players in your own region, either. You can vote on pros to represent all of the competing regions in each of the five positions. You can also vote on as many, or as few, positions as you want. But you can't change your vote once it's submitted, so remember, no take-backsies.\n\n> Once the rosters are decided, the pros will then be placed into either Team Fire or Team Ice and the two teams will compete against one another throughout ASE. Both Team Fire and Team Ice will be comprised of three regional teams.\n\nhttp://www.lolesports.com/en_US/all-star/all_star_2016/about\n\nWhen does all of this open, though? \n> Mark your calendars because voting opens on November 6 and runs until November 10 at 11:59 PM PT\n\nhttp://www.lolesports.com/en_US/articles/2017-all-star-vote-how-choose-your-dream-team\n\nHopefully that answers all of your questions!","replies":[{"poster":"Time Criminal","date":"2017-10-24T18:43:50.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Canc","date":"2017-10-24T05:25:23.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can't even open the site","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-10-24T10:17:05.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All-Star voting will open shortly after the Worlds Finals!
