In future, you're better of simply not using such terms, even just to confirm others have used it (for example, rather than using the term itself you could have said \"constantly calling people names\" and potentially avoided this situation).\n\nThat said, it does seem that you carry a rather negative attitude in your chat use which, while understandable, isn't going to help any. It may help for you to attempt to \"train\" yourself into the mindset of \"if I can't say something constructive, I shouldn't say anything at all\", as that will help avoid exhibiting such behaviours. I'd also recommend using the mute feature (hold tab and click the speaker icon next to the player's score/items) when you encounter players who are abusive. It doesn't change what they've already done, but it can help you stay focused on playing rather than responding.\n\nYou do have the option of appealing the punishment, you simply need to go to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and submit a ticket (select the option \"I have a question about a suspension or restriction on my account\") and inform them of the situation. Keep in mind that their decision is final, and that \"low-tier\" punishments such as chat restrictions are typically not removed.","replies":[]}]}
