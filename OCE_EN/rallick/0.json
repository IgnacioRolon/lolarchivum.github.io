Why is it that i don't have priority to use that username as my new riot name or whatever the hell that is. I now have to login differently to a name i've been using for years, for absolutely zero point. Can someone tell me why our usernames weren't just automatically transferred to this new system?\r\nAnd does anyone from Riot every reply to these questions? Because i asked one months ago about matchmaking and got zero response.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-27T01:07:47.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League of Legends accounts are regional, Riot accounts are global. So if your UN exists elsewhere (e.g you have an NA/PBE/EU/etc account with the same UN) then you won't be able to use that Username until your OCE account is the only one with is. You will have to update those other accounts to different UNs (using the same update link but logging into those other regions) first.","replies":[{"poster":"Rallick","date":"2019-11-27T06:22:26.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So now that i have updated my OCE one, because we have to to login, is that not a permanent change? So i can't change it anyway if i changed the NA one, plus other people in other regions have the same name. What are the odds of anyone having a unique identifier across all regions anyway? Surely there will be overlap and very few people will get to keep their names.\nI get wanting to make a global thing and across platforms/games, but virtually everyone is going to have new logins.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-27T13:16:50.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support can probably help you change or reset the UN if you've changed your OCE one to something you don't want. This is obviously subject to the UN being unique.\n\nAs for the odds, generally pretty good, but very dependent on what kind of UNs you use. So far most people getting the prompt to change their UN seem to be getting it because they have an account with the same on another region.\n\nUltimately it's a compromise, now that other games are becoming a thing, it's much easier for all involved to keep everything centralised. Especially once things start coming to mobile.","replies":[{"poster":"Rallick","date":"2019-11-30T05:20:47.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"So if your UN exists elsewhere (e.g you have an NA/PBE/EU/etc account with the same UN) then you won't be able to use that Username until your OCE account is the only one with is.\"\n\n\"As for the odds, generally pretty good, but very dependent on what kind of UNs you use.

You use any real word/name from any source in culture or literature or anything like that and unless it already has a handful of numbers and such at the end, i reckon your chances are pretty slim. And even if i can change the NA username, there are two other regions that have the same name from the looks of it, that aren't me, so it's still not unique.\n\nJust unfortunate there was no notice (from what i have seen anyway watching all the end of season/preseason videos and releases anyway but i may have missed one i guess), and then in the login it seemed like you couldn't login without changing it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CallMe JOE","date":"2019-11-26T10:04:21.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"seem they didnt care about us. they just care about the money","replies":[]}]}
