We are matched against:\r\nDiamond4 ADC and unranked this season Support (Gold 5 last season)\r\nPlat4 Mid\r\nPlat4 Jungle\r\nGold4 Top\r\nWe can't even queue with our friend in Plat because of division difference, what gives with this sort of matchmaking? On top of that our jungle apparently hadn't played jungle since season 4, inted continuously as did his duo bud in top lane. Then next game we queue and get the same guys who then tell me to \"f off c\" when i said i was going to dodge because i didn't want to play with them again.\r\n\r\nCan someone from Riot please explain how this game came to be? Because it wasn't fun at all, wasn't competitive, and was in promos.\r\nThankyou.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-10-18T10:17:01.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Flex Queue MMR is different to Solo/Duo Queue MMR, they may have been your rank in Flex, but those higher ranks in Solo Queue.\n\nAdditionally, Promos is designed to be harder, how do you expect to climb (or gain any form of skill) if you play against people worse or equal to you, as for the rank difference welcome to Riot Matchmaking, enjoy your stay","replies":[{"poster":"Rallick","date":"2019-11-26T07:59:18.211+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's meant to be the rank of where you are climbing to; i.e bronze promos should be against silvers etc, as that is the equivalent MMR.

Then for the 10 games of promo's it gives you the opportunity to climb higher due to the opponents mmr that you beat or alternatively, gives you a lesson in what areas you can improve on if you are not around that level of skill. \n All you can do is play out the 10 games and go from there when you get given you're final rank.","replies":[{"poster":"Rallick","date":"2019-10-17T10:50:35.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for replying. but 10 games is placements, not promos.\nits also not middle rank when im bronze against plat/diamonds.\nbut i take your point, thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-10-18T22:29:29.856+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah sorry a few spelling mistakes.
