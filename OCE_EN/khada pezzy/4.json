Therefore i couldn&#039;t report him hence why I&#039;m posting here so he can get banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2018-05-23T04:53:50.870+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"HeartVine is correct. Player Support can review cases like this where you weren't able to report if you can supply screenshots and stuff, but more importantly they can also see if this is something that this player is doing frequently in pre/post game chat in other games that actually get played out, and decide if they should apply a punishment manually.","replies":[{"poster":"Khada Pezzy","date":"2018-05-23T05:24:22.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://gyazo.com/ac2f23c4d7c00b2bf04cd1c2c14a51f4\nThe player support is not working I'm already logged in","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-23T07:56:13.774+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The login for the support page and the website (boards) are seperate. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/IrSBuzi.png?noredirect\n\nThere are currently issues with the login transition preventing players from easily logging into support. There are two current workarounds:\n\n1. Open the support page in an incognito/private window and follow the process as normal, pressing the login button when prompted.\n\n2. Log out of the website **from the support page**, and then follow the process as normal, pressing login when prompted.\n\nIf your support page has the blank \"OC\" login in the top right, you're good to go. If it only has your summoner icon with \"OCEANIA\" it means the support page is seeing you as logged in on the website and not in support. You need to follow one of the steps above.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-05-23T04:43:42.548+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you want to do is submit a ticket via [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), ensuring that you provide as much relevant information as possible, including any related evidence. All that will come from posting evidence here is that the \"identifying information\" (namely, summoner names) will be removed (the boards doesn't deal with reports). For future reference, I'd recommend taking a screenshot of the whole client in situations such as this, as that will show as much relevant information as possible in a single image.","replies":[]}]}
