(Note: I legitimately hate ADCs as I am envious and wish I had their positioning and right click mechanics)\nI'm a macro player, meaning I think about the long term. I'll happily die in a dive if it means we come out on top. I'm selfless. I'll go in to steal a baron 1v5, even if I die for it. But mostly, I don't care if I'm behind. I know that my presence in teamfights is still required, as I can be the frontline tank, or the midline caster, who peels instead of carries. If ur looking for people tho, don't hmu. I'm a student about to go into exams and I aint needing added stress of ranked. Maybe try again next year.","replies":[{"poster":"luhke","date":"2016-08-31T12:30:34.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want to have fun while getting some ranked in then I'm happy to be your friend and play some ranked games with you :)","replies":[]}]}]}
