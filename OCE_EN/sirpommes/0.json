Then the champ is too powerful and it isn't fun for anyone, then they are too weak and it isn't fun for anyone. Theres 2 of them in every game so its mirror lanes all week etc. etc.\nits much better to try them out 2 weeks later when eveyone has forgotten that the new champ even exists, they are balanced and you don't have a mirror lane, you know what their abilities are and how powerful they are, and all that.\n\nits like that with ranked, don't play when its all going crazy, play once its all settled back down to normal.","replies":[{"poster":"Fear The Goo","date":"2016-01-27T22:18:41.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nice theory mate, but remember : {{champion:154}} is love, {{champion:154}} is life XD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-01-24T21:20:35.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I kinda just.... play Ranked whenever I have a spare hour or so... you know lol","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BARBINATORisHERE","date":"2016-01-21T06:02:03.467+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was bronze 1, needed a couple of games to go back to silver, won 7 of the 10 games and got demoted to BRONZE FUCKING 5, then they say CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'VE BEEN \"PROMOTED\" TO BRONZE 5. now i have to start over, fuck this system","replies":[{"poster":"Reaper1020","date":"2016-01-21T06:20:57.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same for me, I ended the season in b2 went 6-4 in placements, nothing under an a+ in every game and then got put in b5, it's actually a fucking joke","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"iEmbraceThotties","date":"2016-04-03T06:05:03.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was plat V in S5.
