A half-decent Yi dodges the CC with a well timed alpha-strike. Proceeds to eliminate next target.\n\n**-Game 2- **\n\nYi is picked.\n\nTwo people pick heavy CC users, so at least one of them can hit Yi after alpha-strike.\n\nYi ganks other less dangerous lanes all early game, gets a few early kills.\n\nTeam fight begins, Yi comes in late _(as Yi's do)_, starts attacking ADC.\n\nHeavy CC user 1 has been staying next to ADC, just for this occasion. Heavy CC user 1 fires their CC.\n\nYi dodges CC with alpha-strike, most likely killing ADC in the process.\n\nHeavy CC user 2 notices, re-positions themselves within the fight, fires their CC at Yi.\n\nYi is hit, two heavy CC users proceed to take down Yi. 3 people (one dead) are now focused on Yi.\n\nOther 4 members of Yi's team decimate remaining 2 members of enemy team left alone. Then turn on remaining heavy CC users. creating two 4v2's. \n\n_______________\n\nIts not hard to imagine what games 3 and 4 look like.\nGame 5 begins with a Yi ban of course.\n\nAnd this is all under the assumption that \n\n1. people actually pick heavy CC users in the first place.\n2. heavy CC champs have quick-firing accurate CC, not slow or hard to use CC like Swain's E etc.\n3. people don't use their CC on Draven/Kat/Vayne etc _(who are just as high a priority)_.\n4. people can actually HIT Yi with the CC and not miss or have it dodged.\n5. enough people still remain alive/focused-on rest of enemy team.\n\nThats a hell of a lot of 'ifs' just to deal with 1 champ.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2018-03-15T03:58:53.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find lulu with polymorph is highly effective against a yi.
