My Honor levels has dropped and lost access to free rewards. It also shows me the chat log from that game, but you can clearly see that I was being trolled. In the chat log I have asked why my teammate ban my champ and he said that I was on his inting list. Why would you send me a warning and punish me when you know I was being trolled by my teammate. Did you guys even check properly? how could this still go through?\r\nI might also be suspended somehow if I ever get reported again for going off in chat to who ever is trolling me? why don't you just remove all the chat system in game then, this is ridiculous. Please check before you punish anyone. And if you have.... Its good to know you support toxic players. Maybe then ill quit. And Im new to this game, only been playing for a few months.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-06-20T13:07:28.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The short answer is because two wrongs don't make a right, they just make more wrong. \n\nThe longer answer would require more context on your punishment (i.e your chat logs).

That is not what happened here, I was in no way toxic to the troll during the game. In the chat log I have asked the troll why he  ban my champ and told the others to report the players and my other teammates was saying the same thing. However the troll was only targeting me, he would follow me and take my gold and said he would feed if my other teammate didnt do what he says.\nMAN THIS IS TOO LONG, I dont even care anymore. I'm  too tired to type. I only bacome toxic during the end where we are in the lobby. I told him that he is stupid and should die becuse he said he was gonna report me and my top lane said he was gonna report me too all of a sudden.  I assume they were teammate, Cus I have not said anything other than to report the troll because he was trolling.  I wasn't toxic before, but that was the end line, I said FUCK YOU AND DIE. THATS IT. they left and reported me 2v1. Now Is that all it takes for me to get punish? one sentence . I have proff that I was not toxic untill then. Riot sent me the whole chat log. U clearly see I was trying to adjust and was confused, I was surprise when they hit me with the punish button.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-06-21T09:10:55.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  I told him that he is stupid and should die\n\nSuicide encouragement is classed as no tolerance language and grounds for an instant 14-day ban (perma if you have already received a 14-day ban).

But you are right I was wrong to get mad and say things out of frustration","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-06-22T12:29:50.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Saying things out of frustration and literally telling someone to die (whether it was literally meant or not) are rather on a different level.\n\n\"F%%k you\" is frustration. \"I cannot put into words how much you have ruined this game\" is frustration. \"You are a complete and utter ass%%%%\" is frustration. And yes, if used in excess such things will get you punished, but as a once off you aren't going to run into any trouble.\n\nTelling someone to die? Yeah, that's not okay on any level.\n\nIf your reaction to frustration in daily life from someone causing you (relatively) minor and temporary grief is to *literally tell them you think their life is worthless to the point they should end it*, perhaps you need to re-evaluate that reaction.\n\nEveryone gets frustrated. I've sworn at my fair share of griefers or assholes. Telling them to die is well beyond that.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
