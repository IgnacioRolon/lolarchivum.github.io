I know it's not my computer as I have good specs plus  a decent net. I also don't lag during the week when they're no updates. I seem to be lagging after you guys have released an update. A couple of my friends have the same problem. Just thought you guys should know in case other people have this problem.  \r\n\r\nThanks, \r\nJaffa","replies":[{"poster":"M0nk3y8888","date":"2015-03-29T15:26:14.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been reporting it for months and get ignored. Finally its happening to other people. Except for me its not around the patch releases its when ever I dominate then I get really low fps and normal ping 20-10 fps with NVidia 660+ 2gram p7 64bit 3.4mzh. If I don't dominate and just hang back no lag. I think people know how to lag the server when they are losing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rev SA","date":"2015-02-27T08:01:15.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here!\n\nMine sits around 40~ for about half a minute then spikes up to 60, sometimes as high as 180, before going back to 40. It does this constantly, getting higher as the match progresses.\n\nWhat's worse is that sometimes I lose control of my champ altogether while it comes up with \"attempting to reconnect\", and by the time I get control back I'm usually feeding, executed or sitting on my ass while the rest of the team does a 4v5.\n\nLike you said, this always seems to happen when a new patch gets rolled out, then it (sometimes) aleviates further into the week. It's really annoying!
