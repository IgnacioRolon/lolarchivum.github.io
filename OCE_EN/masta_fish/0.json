Since 10/1/2015, i have been getting disconnections from games and a error report comes up telling me that lol client has a bug . now whenever i try to turn on lol i have the message of \"Unspecified Error Occurred. Please check the logs for more information\" and it just wouldn't load into the login screen. I'm using a Mac and i have been trying to find a solution to this online and i realised that i can't even go into the support page of lol oce and to re-download the game.  I've tried this at home with a window computer and it also appeared to be same issue. The weirdest thing is that when i go to a friend's house with these two laptops, everything seems normal and running. What would causes these problem and how to solve ? is it the internet provider (TPG) blocked my internet gaming or is Riot banned my IP?","replies":[{"poster":"Ratticis","date":"2015-01-12T02:14:21.679+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try the fix i used http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/53Af63zR-unspecified-error-occurred-please-check-the-logs-for-more-information","replies":[{"poster":"Masta Fish","date":"2015-01-12T05:33:51.356+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Although i use Mac but the instruction helped.
