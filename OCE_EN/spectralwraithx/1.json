I check my friend list after match to see if they're still in me friend list. Yep they still are. It doesn't happen all the time but it is annoying. If anyone knows what's going on or how to fix it could they please post something? I would like to know what I can do about this.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-31T02:54:24.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you use /r or /w?","replies":[{"poster":"SpectralWraithX","date":"2015-01-31T04:33:31.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"/r because that's the reply one.

The way you do it, in keystroke form, is: Enter / r \"message\"\n\nYou're doing that, right? It should be working.\n\nThe friend you're replying to, what is their summoner name?","replies":[{"poster":"SpectralWraithX","date":"2015-01-31T07:39:26.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, that's what I'm doing. It only happens some of the time but its still annoying. I go /r and type in my message. I get an error message saying that summoner name is not in my friend list and to try a summoner name in my friend list. it happens with two of them. zelda86 and shadowxwraith. I then have to wait till after the match and apologise saying that I couldn't message them during the match.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-01T00:05:51.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How odd. They don't have any weird characters in their names, which is what I thought would have been causing this to happen. As a work around, you could always minimise the game and bring the client into focus (it's in your taskbar icons, at least on Windows) to reply to them. Or you could try using /w. /r is just a shortcut to /w.\n\nTo use /w, use this:\n\n>/w [summoner name you're messaging] [message]\n\nSay, could you try using /r, but before typing in your message, press space?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
