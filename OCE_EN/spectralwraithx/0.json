Targons brace is recommended for him however his auto attacks are counted as ranged attacks and thus don&#039;t proc the minion execute. It took me ages to figure this out, initially I thought it was a bug but upon rereading I found it only works for melee attacks. This is really frustrating as this is usually a staple on thresh and its really annoying that you have to try and calculate last hit damage with the pathetic support auto attack damage.","replies":[{"poster":"LiI Loli","date":"2016-05-29T08:35:56.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not an issue. it is the recommended support item on thresh regardless. if your not building this on him your going to lack alot of tank that you need for your role.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Koncan5","date":"2016-05-26T15:50:53.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You need to wait for his e to charge. :)","replies":[]}]}
