So, basically the passive is that when this champion lands skill shots on an enemy champion he steals 25 gold from them. This is non scaling and cannot happen twice on the same champion until the cd resets. It'll be on a 20 second cd.  It'll probably be an adc champion. If you think this is a crap passive then tell me. I won't be offended. I just thought it would be a good idea. Or it could be a support champion that grants the thief buff on an allied champion. Thoughts? Opinions?","replies":[{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-02-26T23:40:58.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think if it was just *gaining* and not *stealing* it would be fine, if applied to an item","replies":[{"poster":"SpectralWraithX","date":"2015-02-27T13:18:31.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm, in that case, how about a passive called thief's gloating, where he gains bonus stats based on his max gold? Of course this would fluctuate because everyone has to buy items.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SpectralWraithX","date":"2015-02-21T04:19:54.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair comment although I did say it'd only be 25 gold. Basically I wanted to make this thief like character. His abilities would all steal something from the opponent for a few seconds. Like his q would steal movement speed, his w would steal attack damage, his e would steal ability power. But if everyone hates it then I'll just scrap it and try to think of something else that hasn't already been done.","replies":[{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-02-26T23:42:14.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SpectralWraithX,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=jrpq1dLo,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-02-21T04:19:54.103+0000)\n>\n> Fair comment although I did say it'd only be 25 gold.

I was thinking along the lines of q stealing 5/10/15/20 ad and giving it to the adc. W, 3%/5%/7%/9% movement speed. And 7/15/25/35 ability power (good for champions like ez and corki). I wouldn't have a clue about damage scalings though.... Help? I also have no idea what to do for an ult for this guy...... Also, thanks for your input :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ForPortal","date":"2015-02-20T22:23:36.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm fairly certain that Riot would prefer to leave that kind of rubbish in DOTA. It's an anti-fun mechanic, and needlessly so: if you want to give a +50 gold differential for landing a skillshot (and you really shouldn't), you can do that without making the other player lose their own progress.","replies":[]}]}
