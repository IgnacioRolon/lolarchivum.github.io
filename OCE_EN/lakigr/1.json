I mean iv had a few games when I play her and we have a Malphite or a vi or some one good at jumping into the enemy team. And instead of going for the easy 3 or 4 man ults they choose the one guys by himself. Hell iv even explained to them what to do and they still cant do it like wtf. I know bronze/silver players suck but to not even know how to play this combo is just sad. Hell I had a Malphite last game who could of easily got a 4 man ult with my ball on him. Instead he uses his ult to run away and I&#039;m stuck by myself cos like Malphite the rest of my team decided to run away instead of fighting when we could have easily won","replies":[{"poster":"Cawub","date":"2016-08-05T21:36:43.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of people who play ranked at that level don't take the game too seriously. Sure there are a number of people who are trying their hardest to climb through ranks but at the same time there are people who play ranked with their friends for fun.\n\nEither way these low ranked players are coming from constantly playing normal games where Orianna is very rarely picked (well from whenever I've played) even in ranked she isn't a very popular pick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-08-05T20:24:34.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you have to remember is this, you can actually rank Silver, even while intentionally feeding.\n\nI know someone who season 4 got put into Silver 4 (That was Season 4, she was B3 last season and unranked currently) for what was basically intentional feeding, even though knowing her it wasn't, but she was just so bad that it may as well have been.\n\nAnd she fucking won 5 of her provisionals in Season 4","replies":[]}]}
