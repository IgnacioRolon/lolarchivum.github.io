This includes things such as getting last hits on minions, positioning, trading in lane with other players that you are up against and team fighting. The best way to learn these is to understand what mechanics that you want to focus on learning and then spend your time focusing on that.\n\n---\n\nFor example of you wanted to practice getting better at last hitting, there are handy visual guides that will help you go through drills in custom games to practice and get better [such as this one here. ](http://i.imgur.com/orWUCKH.jpg)\n\nIf you wanted to practice your trading in lane, I would play some 1v1s with some friends in custom games so that you can start out with the basic items and then just fight each other for as long as you want, learning your champions combos, being careful of how much damage minions can do to you, and learning to take advantage of the enemy wasting important cooldowns.\n\n---\n\nOther things that I would suggest doing is find out what champions that you like. For starting champions it really depends on what lanes that you want to play. These are the champions that I would recommend that you save up the IP to get to help you learn the game. \n\n* **Top lane** I would suggest learning Malphite. He is easy to pick up and play along with being a good tank. His ult is really fun in team fights as well if you hit a lot of targets. If not Malphite I would suggest Garen or Darius. Both will teach you trading in lane along with positioning in the lane as you play them.\n\n* **Jungle** I suggest Zac, WW and Malphite. Malphite for the reasons stated above, Zac for his heavy amount of health during his jungle clear along with his team fight pressence and Warwick for his ability to shut down targets with his ult and high damage.\n  * As note IMO make sure you wait until level 30 and you have a full rune page before you try jungling, as the jungle can do a lot of damage if you don't.\n\n\n* **Mid** For mid I say Play Annie, Ahri or Orianna. Annie will help you cs with her Q and have massive amount of team fight presence with Tibbers, Ahri will teach you how to land combos and skill shots, and Orianna will help you learn multitasking and how AOE can massively effect team fights.\n\n* **ADC** If you are wanting to learn ADC I say go for Ashe or MF. Ashe will heavily teach you positioning a long with her ult helping you with skill shots a long with setting up team fights or kills for your team. MF will teach you about comboing ultimates in team fights and heavy focus on positioning yourself correctly to land abilities with things such as her Q bounce.\n\n* **Support** I suggest going with Leona, Soraka or Annie. Annie was touched on in the mid lane section, Leona will heavily teach you about crowd control along with choosing when to fight in bot lane and Soraka will teach you about how positioning as a support is important too, along with how to position as a healer support.\n\nIf you would like advice on any of these champions, even if they are just simple questions let me know!\n\n---\n\nNow for your runes since you will be on a budget, the first thing that I would recommend is saving up IP until you are level 20 before you buy any. You are going to want tier 3 runes which you unlock the ability to get at level 20. After that since you are new to the game and I am sure you are going to want to be buying champions with your IP, let me go over two basic rune pages, that are cheap on IP for you to buy and use.\n\n**AD**\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/9r6oJgS.jpg\n\nThis is the rune page that you are going to want to run on all the Attack Damage champions that you play. This goes from ADCs, to some mid laners, most top laners, most junglers and some supports. (If you are ever curious if a champion is AD or AP, you can either ask me or do some research and see what items people build on them, this will give you an idea as to what rune page to take on them.)\n\nFor the specifics of the rune page you are going to be want:\n3x AD Quintessences, 9x AD Marks, 9x Armor Seals and 9x Magic Resist Glyphs.\n\n**AP**\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ri6y18F.jpg\n\nThis rune page is for the AP champions that you play. This is mostly for your mage champions such as Ahri or Annie along with some supports, some junglers and some top laners. \n\nFor the specifics of the rune page, I would recommend running.\n3x AP Quintessences, 9x Magic Pen Marks, 9x Armor Seals and 9x Magic Resist Glyphs.\n\n---\n\nOther than that if you haven't already I would highly recommend reading the new player guide that Riot has made. [You can find it here if you haven't looked through it already.](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/guide/index.html) This will teach you a ton of information that will help you on your journey into the game. It can be a very useful reference for information about Maps and Champions.\n\n---\n\nI hope that this information helps! Feel free to add me in game and we can play some games sometime and I will give you advice as we go along. If you have any other questions for me feel free to ask as well, and good luck in your games.\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-01-19T03:08:26.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you might want to change that AD rune page a little and swap the marks to attack speed since this generally feels better on most auto based adcs and is also pretty important for ad junglers to have healthy clears.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-01-21T00:14:14.560+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Greetings NightJar,\n\nYes I do agree with you that attack speed marks can really feel a lot better, however as these are just general rune pages you want to make these fit on as many different champions as possible. For example there are a decent amount of AD champions such as Miss Fortune, Fiora and Riven in my opinion that work a lot better with flat AD reds compared to attack speed. \n\n---\n\nAlong with this the other thing to keep in mind is cost IP wise, AD reds are 204 IP each which is quite cheap (and they are actually on sale for 102 IP each at the moment) whereas attack speed runes are 410 IP each. At the moment I am building these rune pages assuming that we are on a budget because a lot of IP will want to go into champions for example that they want to learn and play to build their basic mechanics.\n\n---\n\nA quick side note here that since they are still learning, having extra attack speed while learning to last hit could be a bad thing, as they are getting used to an enhanced auto attack speed and it might make things harder to swap off of using attack speed in their marks since they will be used to it.\n\n---\n\nEnd of the day though it comes down to personal opinion and playstyle. I like to take attack speed in my Quints where it is needed on ADCs instead of Marks, but I have seen a lot of people take them in Marks instead of Quints or even both and it suits them quite well. As though since our friend here is still learning the game, basic rune pages are a good way to save up the IP, spend it and then not really have to worry about them to instead focus on building their mechanics in game and improving.\n\nHope this helps clarify a bit, if there any other questions you have let me know.\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-01-21T03:28:26.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fair enough, I hadn't thought about these finer details such as the development of bad habits.
