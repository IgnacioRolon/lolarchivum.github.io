When you are playing a game of league shifting blame is never something that you want to do. This not only demotivates people but it doesn't really tell them what they need to improve on.

When you say that you aren't trying this isn't really a positive thing to say to your team. It demotivates people and I understand that this game felt like it was unwinnable but no matter what happens in a game you can always come back and win. Even if it is a case where you can't come back from the game try to make it a positive and enjoyable experience for the rest of your team and yourself. Like you stated at the beginning you picked GP to learn and this can be good, but your actions in game need to reflect that towards your team.\n\n> Worrior697: I was toxic\n> Worrior697: I raged all game\n> Worrior697: All me\n> Worrior697: Do it now\n> Worrior697: See for your self\n> Worrior697: Well you are trying to get me to rage over it\n> Worrior697: Look it up\n> Worrior697: See for your self\n> Worrior697: Are you running like i3\n> Worrior697: Takes like 1 second\n\nThis here is a bit more of my original point of adding fuel to the fire.

If it is the case that you want to go onto the next game the best thing that you can do without negatively effecting people is throwing in a surrender vote and see how people react to it.

What I would recommend in this case that you leave this kind of stuff for after the game in the post lobby chat. It's best to leave this stuff after the game. If you do this while in game you are not only making the game not an enjoyable experience for your team but trying to tell the other team about it can make their experience worse as well. Quick side note don't just wait for a game to end that does count as being afk which is banable.\n\n--\n\nI feel like I have noted on quite a lot of things, the rest of the game 3 is a lot of asking the team to end which is never a good thing to do for the environment of the game.\n\nAlways try to keep in mind that your actions effect people and try to keep the game a positive environment.

The line represents if you have gone too far or not in being negative. If in your case you explain like how we are humans and respond negatively in chat to negatively in my opinion if that happens once or twice a game with a lot of chatting that's not too bad.\n\nHowever what these chat logs showed is that our banned summoner here consistently did this, which heavily impacted how negative the game was. The way they responded and the words they used could be interpreted as \"looking for fights\" among those who started the fight. Leading to more negative conversation which is hard to stop once it starts snowballing.\n\nBack to the human nature thing you're right it can be very hard to not be negative towards negatively, however I think where the line is drawn is through the actions you see. Players have learnt that if you don't type in chat and for example yell at your monitor when your not in Skype with your team mates does not create a negative environment for your team.\n\nI think this included with the line that you can cross that I discribed earlier may help clarify a bit as to what I ment as to what is too far in my opinion and what warrents a ban.\n\nOther than that always, always keep in mind it doesn't matter who started an argument.\n\n--\n\nIf there is anything I can clarify on this or any other questions I can answer let me know and good luck in your games.\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"y u feed me","date":"2017-01-01T09:38:19.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"quite simply all the report shows is one side. it does not show the other people talking sht, taking the piss nor their actions or lack there of which are all triggers to negative response.

But the issue is I ban got ban once before just because I would join a game and mute everyone from the start.\nMeaning no all. \nNo team chat.\n\nRiot told me when I asked about it why I was ban. Team mates have a negative effect if they do not commutate with their teammates. \n\nSo I am damned if I mute them. I am damned if I don't. But if anyone was fueling the fire..

I wasn't replying to the lux. I had muted her.\nI was reminding the thresh that you don't need to add into the toxic BS I am having to deal with right now. Once I said this to him.

You see I finally worked out how to really do things with GP.. So Riven started on lux again trying to tilt me.\nIf riven tilts me. I won't be able to stop them from pushing and winning.\nBut once again this has nothing to do with just riven and Lux. THIS WAS A FULL ON ATTACK ON ME. \n\nFrom the moment this game started I was attacked non stop by this team. EVERYONE OF THEM TOOK TURNS.. So really. \nSince I didn't say anything like. \n\n\"Donate yourself to science.. the medical breakthrough for autism would be astounding \"\n\nI think a little \" Passive aggressive \" is called for. \nIt is better than saying \" you should have been the load that was swallowed \" \n\n\n> Moving onto game 3, the first thing to note is where you said &quot;FF at 20&quot; while in a sense you might be thinking that you want to give up at 20 and go onto the next game, saying stuff like this communicates that you don&#x27;t want to keep going which can create a negative environment for the rest of the game.

Quick side note don't just wait for a game to end that does count as being afk which is banable.\n> \n\nYeah by this point. Heimer had like 8 deaths. Jihnn was just flat out raging endlessly and then said something about cancer and neck yourself and so on.\nThe people I was reported by.. Was heimer. Which in itself is funny. He was the troll. He kept poking everyone until he tilted everyone.\nBut I get the ban... \n\nAlso I wasn't afk. I couldn't gank lane's which had died 8 times. Bot lane was more worried about raging at heimer. Middle was more worried about raging at everyone else.\n\nBut I am toxic if I point this out. \nI am toxic if I cannot do anything about what my team is doing. \nI am toxic that shaco was one shotting people.\n\nJust because someone is so called \" AFK farming \" DOESN'T MEAN THEY ARE. You see when heimer said he was going to feed. He first claimed he was going to feed Ez.\nMe. I giggled to myself and though.. Mmm he feeds Ez. I shut down Ez. MORE GOLD FOR ME!\nBut he fed teemo. He fed shaco..\n\n2 of the most hardest to kill when fed { Well for me anyway. } so I had to farm more. I tried to take on shaco.. But teemo one shot me with the blind.\nSo when shaco asked if I was afk. \nI said I was just waiting for the game to end. Mainly\n\n1. He would try and find me giving me a chance to catch him without his invis thing he does. \n2. Allowing me to shut him down to get the gold I need to try and do something.\n\nLeague isn't just about how many kills you have or about how much CS you have.\nIt is about the mental game.\n\nSo think of the last game you won. How did you get the win?\nYou found the weakest player and you farmed them as much as you could. \nThis wasn't because you hated that player. It wasn't because you wanted that player to be hurt in real life. \n\nIt was because they were weak and you wanted to win. \n\nNow think of that game you ganged up on that fed player to win. \nYou didn't gang up up them to try and get gold from killing them you did it to be able to push.\n\nSame thing applies when you are behind. If you take out the most fed player. They will back off. Giving you a chance.\nIf they are fed you have to bait them into something that they think they will win.\nWhich is what I was trying to do. If you watch the replay of it. I did go shaco. When he came looking for me.\n\nBut teemo one shot me.\n\n\n> --\n> \n> I feel like I have noted on quite a lot of things, the rest of the game 3 is a lot of asking the team to end which is never a good thing to do for the environment of the game.\n> \n\nThis was because it was over. Shaco had won the mental. Heimer had did what he wanted to do.\nAlso shaco just kept going on and on about how good he was.\n\n\n> Always try to keep in mind that your actions affect people and try to keep the game a positive environment. Another thing to note is keep in mind is it doesn&#x27;t really matter who started it. \n> \n> I hope this helps and if there is anything I can clarify on let me know. \n> \n> ~Elam\n\nThank you for taking the time to reply. \nI understand that it would have taken a bit.

Let me note firstly on what Riot said. \n\nWhen they were talking about muting people in game and not communicating, how that can negatively effect team mates they are right. However keep in mind that was because you stated that you were muting people at the start of a game and muting everyone. This means that you weren't communicating at all which does fit in the category that Riot describes. \n\nAlso keep in mind when you are in game and you mute someone toxic and keep communicating with your team in my opinion that can be ok, it keeps the environment you are in more positive and it encourages your team. Even then you can still communicate with toxic team mates when they are muted for example, you could tell them GJ when they get a kill or communicate with the team as a whole telling them what objective you want to take next such as dragon or baron.\n\n--\n\nThe other thing is when you noted that Riven was adding to the fire for sure. Lets run with the analogy of adding fuel to the fire because analogies are fun. Now when you think about a fire, realistically there are 3 things that you can do in that sense.\n\n1. You could wait for the fire to die down naturally and focus on other things while you wait. \n2. You could add fuel to the fire and make it bigger.\n3. You could get water and try to reduce the size of the fire.\n\nNow when you think about these three actions that you could take, think about my next two questions keeping these in mind:\n\n1. Which of these action(s) do you think riot would like you to take in the situation of a fire in this analogy.\n2. Which of these actions have you observed that you took in these games, and if they didn't line up with what Riot would have wanted you to do, how could you remedy that so that they do. In a sense what could you have changed about what you said or decided not to say at all?\n\nLet me know what you think of these questions and what your thoughts on them are.\n\n--\n\nIf there are any other questions I can answer let me know. Always keep in mind it doesn't matter what actions other people take in game, this is focusing on why the ban happened to you, and understanding why it did happen. Riot bans people to learn from mistakes that they have made and understand what is, and what isn't acceptable in their game. So take this as an opportunity to learn and better the way you interact and play league of legends.\n\n~Elam","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-12-31T08:06:31.640+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm seeing game 2 and game 3 (both of which can be considered extremely passive-aggressive) but no game 1, which makes me wonder: why are you hiding some of the chat logs?

So even with a more benign negative attitude in games 2 and 3, what happened in game 1 brought the whole situation up to another level, possibly by several punishment tiers.","replies":[{"poster":"y u feed me","date":"2017-01-01T09:41:53.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just to add, how does one distinguish without assumption, the emotional context and intent behind text that has no in depth emotional description? words can be written and taken many ways.\n\nggwp can be meant in many ways for example. it is only because of the assumptive nature of the entire thing that all the little things are taken in the same way.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-12-31T05:43:47.961+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Keyboard warrior smh...","replies":[{"poster":"KamikazeBombRun","date":"2017-01-01T06:04:16.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im just staring at the fight up top, its hilarious, want some popcorn?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-01-01T06:17:55.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your telling the truth and those chat logs are correct then I don't think you deserved the ban lol I've seen people say stuff 10 times worse and still get away with it, once again Riot being shitty at their job","replies":[]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-01-01T09:55:53.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I started a thread about this a few months ago asking the same questions. How can a shitty automated system distinguish between general fun and banter or someone being toxic? If someone gets a bee in their bonnet towards the end of the game and decides to report you all that general banter and light-hearted stirring is taken negatively.\n\nThe best thing you can honestly do is don't say anything, ever! Unbind the chat key so you don't type or get that few extra seconds to think about it whilst your re-binding it. Honestly this game is full of the most toxic plebs who turn into HUGE nannies and crybabies when they lose and will report you for the smallest thing. Then you get chat restricted or banned because instead of Riot actually doing something to the people causing others to rage (intent feeders, griefers etc) they'd rather punish those who call them out and don't cop it on the chin silently.","replies":[]}]}
