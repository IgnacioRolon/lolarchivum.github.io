So I main&#039;ed it. I went support healers. Support tanks. JUST SUPPORT!!\r\n\r\nFor last 4 days I went support to see why people hate it.\r\nI have gone from 55% win rate to 20% { I think it is at now. }  due to being support. \r\n\r\nSo to me. Riot has fragged up hard when it comes to this. Why would anyone in the lower elo want to support at all for a random matched team. Master Tier / Diamond and all that is something else all together.\r\n\r\nBut Bronze / Silver seems to be more of a &quot; Stay away from support or you will lose so much you start to hate everyone in this game &quot;\r\n\r\nhttp://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/136521911/34120705?tab=overview\r\n\r\nThis is a key point in what I am talking about. We all know the more you ward. The more you see on the map. \r\nBut that game I was the only one doing it.\r\nSo really... Why would I continue to support. 4 days of loss after loss after loss. Before I supported on this account. I was on silver 5 promos daily. I would win 2 lose 3. But it didnt matter.\r\n\r\nI would be on promos again in a game or two. So I would have another chance. Now I am in B2 almost B3 due to playing support. \r\n\r\nSo to end this rant. This is why Supporting is the most unplayed role in this game. When you main support.

In bronze, many games is won by solo carrying so the support role becomes insignificance. The jungler and mid has the best chance of carrying and support + adc has the least chance to influence the outcome.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JannÃ¡","date":"2016-06-11T02:08:44.285+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support's never a loved role that's for sure. I'm a support/mid main, and I'm fairly sure I get mid maybe once out of 4-5 games if that. I've been playing this game since season 2-- been bronze for the most part, until I decided to do a couple of things to climb out. I went from B2-G5 last season, and I'm currently G3 after climbing from S1 (granted, I only play once a week).\nIt's important as support, that champ and team comps matter heaps. Whilst it's the generic role to just ward and set up plays, a support like Janna and Soraka has a very different play style to Shen or Morg. Positioning, playing according to the enemy AND your own ADC and realising when to go in and when not to are also important. I often remind my team to get pink wards or place their trinkets, or tell my laner when I'm roaming/warding/backing. Communication is key! Even if your adc is blinder than lee, you can always, ALWAYS win, if not your lane, than snowballing mid or helping the jungler when they gank.\nLike I said earlier, champions that disengage/peel are easier for a passive/less skilled/less likely to follow lane, and champions which actively go for kills/agressive/kill-lane, are easier to snowball in a lane you know will win! In addition, play styles should be adjusted according to their team, your team, your adc/lane-- items too. \nI love playing support. I'm often a Soloq player so I rarely encounter an ADC I'm familiar with; but you do eventually learn to adapt. Whilst support players dont get a lot of credit nor love, it's a little inside smile that motivates me when you place a ward that results in a win for your team, or land a 5 man wave that leads to a penta kill or a flash heal exh which saves your adc! It's also vital to remember that not every winning lane will lead to a winning game and vice versa! You can't win them all, but you can certainly try! (I say this with a 52% win rate from 65%+ last season)\nSure, my win rate isn't that high and neither is my rank; but never give up! Support's for sure, a love-hate thing :) Keep healing and may good ADC's be with you","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-06-14T09:25:26.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support main here!\n\nI loved this idea, I hope you keep up us updated on how this experiment goes.

I would be extremely surprised if your winrate went up after only 4 days.\n\n **Be patient, it might take close to a month for you to begin to get good at support.** It's already happening slowly right now anyway, your winrate has increased to 35%.\n\n+ I'd also recommend checking out this videos for some good carry supports and tips.
