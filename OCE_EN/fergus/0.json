The Nautilus artificial reef was the final reward in Ocean Week 2015. Players from all around Oceania played games with specific Ocean Week champions (like Fizz, Nami or Nautilus) to contribute one point per win. The points required to construct the artificial reef was a hefty 275,000 from all Oceanic players.","url":"http://promo.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/oceanweek-reef/index.html#gallery","image":"http://promo.oce.leagueoflegends.com/assets/oceanweek/img/leona.png"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I know for sure that I contributed more that 3 points (like in the 10-20&#039;s), but my name isn&#039;t on the boards.
