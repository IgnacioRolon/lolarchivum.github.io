Only Huemens and Koalas (I'm the latter).\n\nSecondly, I would like to take a moment to point out that Rito are literally trying to balance Warmog's on ARAM rather than removing it, so *kind of* goes against your first point.\n\nThirdly, Urgod *needed* an update, and it was *good* for him. That's not to say all reworked champs needed updates, or that they were good, but for Urgod particularly, that remains true.\n\nLastly, you seem to be missing something from that list. I'll fill it in for you:\n> Give Tag Team back to Quinn. She needs it, Valor needs it, the OG Quinn mains need it. The change was unnecessary. Also, blind, *not* short-sight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2018-06-25T12:06:53.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Making league fun would be done by getting rid of chat.... ez","replies":[{"poster":"Boolhya","date":"2018-06-25T14:27:20.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"/mute all","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Stew52","date":"2018-06-24T21:31:20.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do not want Riot to touch Morde after seeing Riven 2.0 ({{champion:266}}).","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-06-24T19:50:00.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Are you by any chance an assassin main :)","replies":[]}]}
