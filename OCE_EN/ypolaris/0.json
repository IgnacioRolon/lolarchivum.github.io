I picked Trundle to go top and we had a Gankplank who said he will go mid.\r\n\r\nThere was a guy who had 4th pick and then he picked Zed. He said he will have to go mid and will duo if necessary.\r\n\r\nOur GP was kind enough to move to bot lane.\r\n\r\nWhen the game started, I said there is a ban system now and he should not do such stuff. He then said it will be good for his life if he is banned. He then started coming top lane as the creeps spawned. So I went mid instead and he followed me to mid lane.\r\n\r\nHe followed me for the first 8 minutes. I said in all chat &quot;Report this Zed&quot; and then the enemies realized we are in disharmony. Zed intentionally gave  a kill to the opponent mid laner as soon as he arrived at mid when the opponent mid laner asked him to give him a kill.\r\n\r\nAfter 8 minutes past, he then changed his heart and started goofing around and feeding.\r\n\r\nThis is not what I expected from ranked games. I would take this if it was normal but this Zed just ruined my gaming experience to the extent that I felt like I will quit this game if the same thing happens again, or at least not play ranked anymore.\r\n\r\nAnd the opponent mid laner flamed me using all sorts of words, siding with Zed, perhaps to create a diversion in our team so that he can win the game. I am wondering if such behaviour is actually being moderated nowadays.\r\n\r\nIs there a tribunal system set up in Oceania now?\r\n\r\nBecause I really to see something done here.\r\n\r\nI already reported him but it will do anything to him?","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-12-20T18:01:54.083+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"CandyVanisClosed","date":"2015-12-20T21:47:03.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"9months and counting,nothing will happen because it hurts there bottom line...\nTake a look,its there at the top of the forums..","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-12-20T23:00:41.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Despite the fact that people who don't care about their accounts and spew bullshit don't pay anything.\n\nYeah getting rid of people who never buy skins will totally hurt the bottom line.","replies":[{"poster":"CandyVanisClosed","date":"2015-12-20T23:48:41.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I think you will find that is wrong tbh....\nEVERY player spends money on this game....\nAlso then maybe there other account that they dont troll on should be banned its not hard to see....\nWould something like a hardware ban be worthy....\nFunny how every other game can do this i bet they know your specs when you start up this game would be very easy to stop this in its tracks...","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-12-21T01:47:05.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No actually.\n\nLoL is the only modern game I've seen or even heard of that takes initiative in controlling it's player behavior.\nThe closest anyone else has done is having player controlled servers (such as Minecraft/TF2/Unreal Tournament) where the person who pays for the server dictates what the players are allowed to do on their server.\n\nIf you really think Riot does nothing, then check out Dunkey.
