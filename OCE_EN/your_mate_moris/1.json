I mean, i've seen people being fished in the dumbest of ways. I've even fished one of my friends myself by posing as a diamond with a lv1 smurf, took less than a minute. Or when i got a friend to start, the first thing he asked me is \"do you know if there's any, like, hacks or stuff? I'm searching but maybe you know a few\". Jumped in right in time before he lost his account to the everflashing singed scam.\n\nJust... Don't trust people to be smart, man.
