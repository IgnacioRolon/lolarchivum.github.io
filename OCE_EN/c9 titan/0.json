He changed his password and username through the recovery system yet still cant get into his account.

They will ask him a whole bunch of questions to verify the account ownership, and will likely ban it (security ban) until the ownership and security is sorted out. Support can take a day or two to get back to you, though to the best of my knowledge they get a first response to _most _ tickets in under 24 hours.\n\nHe should change the password to his linked email as well, in case that's how they got in. You say he still can't get into his account despite changing the details, does it say the details are wrong or what is the deal with that? That seems strange if he changed the details. Let me know how it goes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LPQ AWOL","date":"2017-03-01T22:33:32.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"dont even bother about it mate, my account was hacked a coupe of months back, i sent a ticket to support, they replied and wanted details, i know for a fact i gave the right details, all besides the first 3 refunds i done, i even gave the last 5 rp cards i bought from the shop and enterd the codes in, i gave them them codes, and they still declined me, i can even bet for a fact that no one has tried to claim the account back besides me. riot dont give a shit, i told them all the ip address, how much champs, where the account has been played(all cities, all icafes), visa debit card numbers, email address, all passwords, everything under the sun, and was declined because i didnt know the first 3 refunds, even thought i had spent well over $500 on that account, seriously, riot dont give a fuck about their players.","replies":[{"poster":"LPQ AWOL","date":"2017-03-01T22:35:36.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"account i am talking about is smokedaawg, they dont give 2 shits, tell me this, if the account wasnt mine, why would i go through so much shit for a bronze account? if i wanted to lie and steal an account, wouldnt i want to steal and high elo account?","replies":[]}]}]}
