How about u get options to which time of ward skin u can chose for each type of ward.  For example, in the same game, you have a purple ward which is a mecha ward skin, a green ward which is a battlecsat ward skin and a blue ward which is a riot ward skin. I think its a cool idea but yeah :D","replies":[]}
