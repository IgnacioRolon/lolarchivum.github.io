This is something that we're currently working on resolving.\n\nIn the meantime, you can work around this issue by resetting your DPI settings back to 100%. You can do so by following the steps below:\n\n1. Go to Control Panel \n2. Go to Appearance and Personalization \n3. Go to Display \n4. Choose the 100% (default) option \n5. Click on Apply \n6. Re-launch League of Legends\n\nAlternatively, you can use the Windows Key and Search \"Personalization\" (without the quotes) and continue from Step 3 onwards.\n\n\nWe're working on fixing it, but there is no ETA at this stage.\n\nBest Regards,\nMindstar","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Emplicator","date":"2014-11-20T23:09:36.879+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hi, when find a match on LOL and  go past the champion select screen i get up to the connecting screen where you see the champions everyone is using i load upto around 7% then the game crashes saying\n\nError\nAn essential game asset was not found when loading the game:\n\nSRUAP_Turret_Order3_Test\n\nPleasae try reinstalling the game.....\n\nwhen i try reconect it justs shows me a message box saying i have no internet or something but i can mesage people using the lol client...
