The game has started and i can hear the ingame music and people spawning/killing each other.. But i cannot open the game.. When i click on the minimized button on my Task line, i just minimize right away again.. \n\n\nSo basically.. The game is running, but it stays minimized no matter how many times i click to open it up.. Tryed to renew ip, run as admin, nothing worked.. Is this something you're familiar with??
