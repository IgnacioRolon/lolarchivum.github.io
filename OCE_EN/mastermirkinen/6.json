Recipient: c0mikal (>2 week friend)\n\nCan only gift recommended items; there's no dropdown/collapse list to browse items (not sure if this is intended). Sender is notified of which skin was received. The recipient does NOT receive any notification of the gift, although it shows up as \"owned\" in the champions tab (I told him which one he recieved via Skype). There is a large delay before RP is deducted (I relogged and still had to wait for a while). Doesn't show up in Gifting History.\n\nHopefully I don't run out of RP before Christmas now :( After Eternum Rek'sai I won't have a lot left for any sales that come on. :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"SoresuMakashi","date":"2014-12-12T09:05:12.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, doesn't seem to be working.
