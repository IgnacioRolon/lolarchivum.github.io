Please let us know if the problem persists.\n**Edit2**: As of 10.19 (Syd Time) IX Australia (who we peer with for some ISP) has restored the connections but it is possible that some ISP have disabled that route as a precaution. This means that until they restore their configuration, there might still be some issue for some players. Best at this point is to contact your ISP.","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2016-04-01T00:04:26.437+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"DODO, iPrimus and other affected players - please read this if you are still unable to connect to games.\n\nWe're working to find out where the root cause is for the issue, so If you are still unable to connect to games can you please do the following:\n\n* Run a [trace route](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq2) to the OCE servers (103.240.227.5)\n* Note your local IP address (you can find out by visiting http://www.whatismyip.com/)\n* Note your ISP and Location (city)\n* Send this info to our collection email address - ocelivereports@riotgames.com\n\nThis will hopefully give us the necessary information to find out why you are unable to connect.\n\nThanks!\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2016-04-01T00:31:18.831+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your responses folks.
