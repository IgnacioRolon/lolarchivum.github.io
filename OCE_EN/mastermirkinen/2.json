This update may not cover everything so if you feel we should cover a specific topic, let us know.**\n\nSummoners,\n\nwe are halfway through the year and seems like a good time to stop for a second and reflect on what have we done in the first half of 2015 and what more we need to do to make sure we live up to your expectations. \nWhen discussing internally about things we could improve, among the several areas of work there was one which we believe is the key to succeed in our mission: better communication with our OCE players.\nWe provided updates in the past but we want to try something now and introduce the &ldquo;_**tell us what you want to be updated on**_&rdquo;\n\nBelow you will find updates from some of the Rioters in the Sydney office. These are information we think may interest you but hey, we may be wrong.\nIf there is something you feel we should give an update on (e.i. WTF is the OCE skin just to name one), please post it below. \nThe upvote / downvote system will do the rest and if a topic is popular enough, we might create a sticky post like Stupendous did for [Ocean Week Reef](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/fr6JJdBE-ocean-week-reef-status). \nThe idea behind _stickying _the most popular questions is that at any given point you should find updated information on the sticky so if you, a friend or a random OCE player asks &ldquo;Hey Rito, what&rsquo;s going on with the Ocean Week statue&rdquo; we can always point him/her to that post.\n\nTo set some expectations: there are some topics we, from the Sydney office, are better equipped to answer (like local events, community, esport, connectivity&hellip;) and some other we are not (champion design, game balance, game features). We will do our best to reply to both but we may need the help from other Rioters in Santa Monica and this may take more time.\n\nHere the topics you will find in this update:\n- [Talent](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/iFdEkXnp-riot-oce-update-and-qa?comment=0004)\n- [Service Availability](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/iFdEkXnp-riot-oce-update-and-qa?comment=0000)\n- [Community](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/iFdEkXnp-riot-oce-update-and-qa?comment=0001)\n- [Events](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/iFdEkXnp-riot-oce-update-and-qa?comment=0005)\n- [Competitive](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/iFdEkXnp-riot-oce-update-and-qa?comment=0003)\n- [Player Behavior](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/iFdEkXnp-riot-oce-update-and-qa?comment=0002) \n\nThanks for your attention and looking forward to some tough questions :)\nMasterMirkinen","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-07-28T02:45:41.276+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know your riot OCE guys probably hate getting this, but it's been over 2 years since the OCE server was released, and we still don't have our server skin.\nThe community has thrown numerous ideas at you, some good, most bad. Obviously because of the wide diversity of the OCE server, it's hard to make a skin that will appeal to everyone, and we understand that.\nBut at this point, most of us honestly couldn't care what the skins theme is, and the ones that do are probably in the vast minority. Most people have given up on ever getting the skin, but I'm still hopeful that it will come eventually. There was an update a few months ago I think, but I'm not too sure.\nWe just want to know what's happening with it, if you've narrowed it down to a few ideas or what, anything, and if you can give us an ETA on it.\n\nNext question, what ever happened to Riot Penguinguru? he was active on forums for a bit then seemed to disappear off the face of the earth.\n\nAlso, are there any plans to continue or restart with the Riot vs OCE Community games?

This February we submitted another idea (which came from Maraudaur) and the skin team loved it! They loved it to the point they started evaluating it as a skin relevant for the lore or LOL and not just OCE. By doing this, the process slowed down more. There was also a flag on a particular aspect of the skin which required a bit of investigation. In the last couple of weeks we had good conversations with the skin team and we are now ready to move to the next steps which are:\n- skin team to work on a prototype\n- OCE team to work on launch plan (to make this special for OCE players)\n- once prototype is ready, there will be a go - no go meeting as every skin has to reach a level of quality and we cannot confirm 100% till we see it created.\n- release the skin\nIn term of ETA, this is not possible to say. If everything goes well, it could be at the end of they year but if something goes wrong it could be later. We may reach a point though were pushing more is not going to lead to anything and if we reach that point, we may not have an OCE skin. We are not close to that point yet but if we do, we will tell you straight away.\n\n> Next question, what ever happened to Riot Penguinguru? he was active on forums for a bit then seemed to disappear off the face of the earth.\n\nHe left Riot.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Cochese","date":"2015-07-28T02:17:29.451+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello everyone,\n \nI’m Riot Cochese and I run the Live Services team here in Oceania.\n\nMy first thought, as I sat down to write this update was: what can I write here that won’t upset our players that have connectivity issues, those that seem to suffer more pains than other players, the ones that feel we aren’t doing anything to help them. \n\nWe have come a long way since that first day, and if you take away any message here, please know we are not sitting idle. We are not done; we are continuously looking for improvements and working with ISPs to get the absolute best for all of you.\n \nLooking back to launch, there have been a number of improvements over the years. We went from, very excited to get the region launched, to the unknown, and then a slew of challenges and player pains to address. We’ve learned so much about the region since then. For one, this part of the world is massive in size and scale, how do you facilitate a great experience for every player, in every location?\n \nThere have been some bumps and bruises; in fact, most of you would likely associate my name to an incident that occurred at one time or another – because that’s where I post on the boards – in \"Help and Support\". The truth is, when our team is doing a good job, you won’t even notice, because you are able to play the game, when and where you want. That’s the way it should be! We love going unnoticed, trust me, but that is not always the case.\n \n**What have we done?**\n \n*  Added more diversity to our datacenter, to get better coverage across all the major ISPs in the region\n* Established syncs with ISP providers to discuss pain points we see, and hear from you\n* Improved the patching process, I hope nobody remembers the 8 hour patches that occurred last year! The last patch, 5.14, was 45mins total.\n* There is more, but I’m not here to pat our teams back\n \n**Our commitment to you?**\n \n* Push ISPs to improve in areas that we see our players having problems in\n* Be clear and forthcoming about service issues that impact you\n* Listen to what is important to you, and focus on improving those areas: Connection Quality!\n* Take decisive action to make things better, working from your feedback, and enacting positive change\n\nI’m not here to say that our service is perfect, but committing to making it better every single day.\n \nGL;HF\nRiot Cochese","replies":[]},{"poster":"HellenicX","date":"2015-07-28T03:50:43.065+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nWill ranked 3s ever come to OCE?

Is this person a gamer? Do they have a genuine passion to help level up the player experience in Oceania? This are questions we ask when looking at an application. \n\n2)  The key here is how qualified is the applicant in relation to an open position.

It’s really cool that you’re working on highlights – they can be tough work!\n\nIn terms of advice I’d say that you should try and focus on getting the technical elements right. No matter how well edited, if your sound isn’t right then people will be turned off. ( I know you had a glitch with your recorder so you’re already on the right track). Another thing is to make your transitions a little smoother and a little more obvious – sometimes you bring in the next shot before the previous one has finished its transition out - if using a dip to black between plays, make sure your video and audio fade out completely before you fade in the next shot. \n\nOther than that I would say just keep practicing and getting better.
