Part of their contract was to dig the line they replaced and they just left it above ground. Doesnt help that Tesltra owns the exchange and only installs copper wiring for our whole town. They reckon i should be getting 11mbp/s but i cant even get 1% of that, 150kbp/s max download sure is great.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Valkyrie Leona","date":"2014-12-06T08:06:38.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i am having spikes and im from sydney northern shore","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2014-12-06T07:40:17.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That moment when a Rioter is making a lag thread!\n\nQUICK TO THE LOSS PREVENTED-MOBILE BATMAN!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ngau","date":"2014-12-06T07:00:01.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm from Sydney using Telstra as well but i'm fine :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2014-12-06T06:40:47.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had issues yesterday in Brisbane during the storms and had a teammate completely DC.
