In an effort to ensure price equality on the server and respond to rising costs caused by recent economic shifts, we are adjusting the cost of RP in Oceania. This will result in a 13% RP price increase for Australian players.\n\nThis change will take effect in two weeks on March 20th at 11:59PM Sydney Time. We are delaying the actual change in prices to give players one last chance to stock up before the change. \n\nHere are the new amounts of RP you will receive as of 21/03/2015 for credit cards\n\n**For Credit Card**\nBASE+BONUS=TOTAL\n5 AUD/NZD - 520+0=520\n10 AUD/NZD - 1040+60=1100\n20 AUD/NZD - 80+170=2250\n35 AUD/NZD - 3640+360=4000\n50 AUD/NZD - 5200+700=5900\n100 AUD/NZD - 10400+1700=12100\n\n**For Prepaid Card**\nBASE + BONUS RP = TOTAL\n10 AUD/NZD - 1100+0=1100\n25 AUD/NZD - 2750+80=2830\n50 AUD/NZD - 5500+400=5900\n\nWe want to be transparent in doing this and have provided some more context below:\n\n**Why are we increasing prices?**\nThis will be our first price increase in almost two years, so why now? It really boils down to server fairness and rising cost due to economic shifts. \n\nWe attempt to keep RP prices in relative balance, especially when on the same server. Back in October, the Australian dollar started weakening against the New Zealand dollar and it caught us by surprise. This depreciation has resulted in pricing discrepancies between the Oceanic countries. We monitored the situation for several months hoping that it would recover, but we are now at a point where a price change is necessary.\n\nUnfortunately, simply reducing New Zealand prices alone won’t fix this. Another factor we need to take into consideration is the exchange rate between local currencies and USD. Because a big part of our costs come from the US, where the dollar continues to rise, we need to consider prices relative to the US as well. Therefore, we have decided to raise prices in Australia to bring them back into balance with New Zealand and the US.\n\n**Are there any other reasons a price change can happen?**\nThere are many factors that determine how we price globally. In this case, server fairness and costs due to currency were the primary drivers. However, we also monitor other factors such as inflation or substantial infrastructure investment. So far we haven’t felt the need to make changes for these reasons. \n\n**What about other regions?**\nWhen economic environments change to a point where it places regions out of balance, then we look to make adjustments. Recently, we’ve made adjustments to RP prices in Brazil, Turkey, Russia, Chile and Argentina, and today we are introducing changes to regions including Oceania, Europe and Canada. \n\n**Any impact on IP or existing content?**\nNope. You can still purchase content for the same amount of IP and RP as before. \n\n**Does the change affect already bought prepaid cards?**\nIt will affect the card from the changeover date, which is one of the reasons we’re giving players 2 weeks notice to redeem cards while the value of RP is unchanged.\n\nIf you have any questions about this process please post them in the comments below!\n\nPosting here most frequent questions from you and the answers:\n\n**Does it mean that every time the dollar goes up or down we will have a change in the RP prices?**\n> No. There are many things that factor into pricing decisions besides just currency - such as interest rates, inflation, competition, costs, investment into League of Legends and parity across countries.\nAt the same time, we don't want to create an artificial stock market for RP. It is not our intention to constantly change prices with relative movements in currencies and create a lot of speculation among players. \nTherefore we have decided to monitor the situation and to make changes only if currencies or inflation make significant long term moves.\nWe don't take this decisions very lightly as evidence by the fact that we waited several months before making these chances here.\n \n**Why didn't you change the prices when the Australian dollar was stronger than the US dollar?**\n>Changing RP prices is not something we want to do every time there is a currency variation. We decided to make changes only if currencies or inflation make **significant long term moves**.\nIf you look at [this graph](http://apollo-uploads-oce.s3.amazonaws.com/1425611690499/6-3-152-08-21PM.png), you can see the exchange rate of AUD and USD since we launched here in Oceania. When we launched, we positioned our prices slightly lower than the US because we were not sure where the dollar was going.\nAny time the currency went above that line, in OCE we paid a bit more. As you can see, it happened only once and for a short time.\n\n**Why is the US dollar even a factor for OCE prices?**\n>While we have a passionate local team here in SYD, it's important to remember that many of our costs are in US Dollars, which are currently trending strongly against most global currencies. Some of these increased costs will be offset by the price increases.\nEach region (OCE in this case) should be responsible for covering its own costs to publish the game (servers, community, etc), but all regions should contribute to the costs of developing the game (programmers, artists, etc).\n\n**As a purchaser of RP, it would be reassuring to know that Riot is investing in OCE though (infrastructure, community, eSport...)**\n> While community and eSport is probably easier to see, we are doing a poor job in sharing what we are doing in OCE on the infrustructure and connectivity front.\nWe have done TONS of things to improve connection and even more are in the pipeline but we simply didn't inform you.

One reason we aren't quite so transparent on the specifics of our network & server infrastructure is that we prefer to keep the architecture and some details of the configuration private.  This is because if too much information is out there, it becomes much easier understand & attack potential weak spots, which wouldn't be fun for anyone.\n\nThat said, we actually do invest quite a lot of effort into infrastructure specifically for the Oceanic server and I'd like to give a quick rundown of some of the key achievements we've made over the last year.\n\n**Internet Connectivity**\n\nWhen we opened the Oceanic server, we had a single internet connection in place for our game servers.  This worked but players were dependent on how good their ISPs connection to our ISP was for their connection to League.  That can be quite variable at time, and often introduces issues that are completely outside a players', or Riot's, control.\n\nOver the last year we have added direct connections to a number of the most popular ISPs, providing a much better connection path for players on those ISPs to reach us.  We have some big goals to improve this further over the next 12 months, and this is a big area of focus for the team here.\n\nExample: TPG & Firewall errors.\nWe added a direct peering link with TPG in September.  Beforehand, a very large number of TPG players (including some local Rioters) experienced the firewall error very regularly.  This was due to TPG players having poor connectivity to League through the ISPs Riot were using at the time.  We added a direct link between TPG's network and Riots network, which was able to bypass the problem connections, and the result was a much more stable experience for TPG players.\n\n**Infrastructure Improvements**\n\nGlobally, Riot learns a lot from the services we run, and a cycle of improvements based on this is usually ongoing.  Oceania is not excepted from this learning and improvement.  A huge part of the job we do locally is to make sure we adopt changes that matter for our region.\n\nAs an example, during the second half of last year, the Oceanic servers underwent a complete architecture refresh for our game server networking.  This was aimed at adopting the latest service architecture updates - future-proofing the service, and beefing up network security.\n\n**Infrastructure Costs**\n\nThe Oceanic league server is actually a mix of non-latency dependent infrastructure in the USA, and latency sensitive infrastructure in Australia.  Infrastructure costs in Australia are actually quite high compared to the rest of the world (server internet bandwidth, for example, costs 5x - 10x more).  By putting portions of our infrastructure in North America, we actually reduce a lot of potential cost, however there is some sensitivity to Australian Dollar fluctuations as a result.\n\nThis is of course in addition to the very separate development costs (mentioned in the original post) associated with new league features and functionality.\n\n**Summary**\n\nGoing forward, I think we can do a better job of communicating some of this information to players, and will definitely look to do so where appropriate.  I hope this has done a little to explain some of the behind-the-scenes stuff we do for the tech side of things here in Oceania.\n\nCheers and thanks for reading.\n\nMindstar","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"M3RV","date":"2015-03-06T01:33:07.103+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for the reply Mirk, glad you understood what I meant.

Do remember, Riot do a lot to look after their players. As Mirko mentioned, a lot of costs from Riot (being primarily based in the US) come in US dollars. Since there has been such a big change in the dollars, if they were not to change the pricing of the Australian RP, the higher ups and the bean counters in the US will look at the OCE income based on relative US income and may deem it not worth the investment to stay.\n\nNow, I've always know that Riot don't focus on money, but it's a business in the end and things aren't free. If I had to choose between paying a little more for RP, or having the local offices and the OCE server shut down, I'll pay the little more for RP.\n\nI'm sure this decision wasn't made lightly and I'm sure they won't be fluctuating the RP prices lots, only when dollar prices change considerably.

The RP system is inherently deceptive in itself - publishers have long been using this model to veil the true cost of a transaction (spending 1350 RP or 'X' Microsoft points or gold coins or whatever dissociates a consumer from the true cost of the thing they're buying). It's an established model whereby publishers actively try and discourage consumers from doing the maths - Riot certainly isn't the first or the only ones to employ it but this particular reason why it's used isn't in doubt. I'm not having a go at you, Mirko, but I don't think it's fair to say that providing *extra* information about the USD value of an RP bundle is going to be confusing for customers. On a slight tangent, by requiring RP to be bought in non-refundable bundles (as opposed to being able to buy something in a discrete transaction), Riot gains the benefit of holding/investing the dollar value amount of unspent RP - that adds up to an astronomical amount of even simple interest over the full volume of RP transactions - far more than traditional businesses because there's no warehouse holding skins/content waiting to ship and almost no cost in 'shipping' them. The RP model certainly isn't consumer friendly and any information that would make it more consumer friendly would be greatly appreciated from our point of view I think.\n\nThis is a reply to a comment I saw posted elsewhere but I don't want to seem like I'm angrily replying to multiple comments, so I'll reply here as well :) Granted it's been a while since I've looked at the Australian accounting standards, but I believe it's creative accounting that says that OCE should house a percentage of US R&D costs. As a regional (largely retail) expansion of an already established business model, the OCE budget shouldn't be wearing development costs that are occurring in another jurisdiction. To the extent that OCE expends funds on localising these assets, fair enough, but otherwise, no. If the argument was that OCE's costs have gone up due to the rolling out of the OPL or local programs such as the Ocean Week stuff, then I can get behind it. I think, as you said elsewhere, a large part of the problem is that it's hard to see what Riot OCE is doing for OCE players separate from the stuff that every region gets. Communication of this would go a long way to making people happier I think.\n\nHaving said all of the above, this isn't anything new - Australians have been paying more for video games since forever and also I understand that costs go up over time. However, as the explanation has been couched in economic terms and specifically, exchange rate differentials, it's also worth noting that this adjustment has come at a *really* bad time for Australian consumers. The AUD is at a historically weak point against the USD (the last time it was this low was for a six month period back in 08/09). Interest rates can't get much lower than they are now and when they start to go back up, the AUD will start to appreciate again. The big thing for me, is: can we get some sort of indication that if the AUD gains against the USD, we can expect another adjustment of RP prices? Or rather, because Maraudaur stated that you guys don't want to constantly adjust prices, at what magnitude of change in the exchange rate can we expect an adjustment?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Excited","date":"2015-03-05T23:17:57.642+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":12,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MasterMirkinen,realm=OCE,application-id=3fteLeTW,discussion-id=MXv9uHnL,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2015-03-05T23:10:58.887+0000)\n>\nsome more younger players, may not understand the difference with the international currency and think that they are paying a certain amount in AUD while they are paying that amount in USD (which would be a higher AUD)\n> \n> Basically we believe that having prices in USD would make our players unsure of the real cost they are paying.\n\nDon't insult our intelligence, playing the dumb card may work in the US where people love their guns, war and lack of teeth more then each other, but not here. come on mate try again","replies":[{"poster":"Xeo kytaf","date":"2015-03-05T23:59:43.366+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"They're not insulting our intelligence. :| You do realize there are some very young people who play League, right?

Instead of the very little skins and champs you put up for sale, you could increase that pool, maybe target champions by play rate,  you'll make a whole lot more profit with your prices going down than the amount of RP given per card going down. You'd also avoid... well... this *points to the comments section*. There's a reason that \"my wallet is like an onion, every time I open it, I cry\" meme exists, because the community can't resist buying a great looking skin. By taking a small sacrifice, you could increase your skin sales by a lot. There's a reason fast food businesses make a lot more profits than most restaurants, and to add to that, with their fast turn-over, they have to buy more ingredients. All you have to do is say \"cheap skins, buy now, offer won't last long\" and extend the sale for a month. You don't have to increase the pays of any of the graphic designers or coders for putting a skin on sale. You don't have anything as close to the material costs as any other field would, it's literally all wages. You're going to drop the amount of sales dramatically. \"This will be our first price increase in almost two years, so why now? It really boils down to server fairness and rising cost due to economic shifts\". Businesses have to make money, you really think McDonalds prices match all around the world? No. Are people complaining? No. Your financial planners need to rethink their procedures. Sorry, not sorry.\n\nEDIT: I also want to add that for a region which has a huge market for gaming, Riot isn't doing anywhere near enough official hosting and/or participation. About a week ago, the University of New South Wales' LoLSOC or League of Legends Society hosted 1v1 and 2v2 tournaments which weren't given any Riot coverage whatsoever, all streaming was done on a LoLSOC member's Twitch, yet the day after the 1v1 tournament, Riot NA members came to have a Q&A with members from LoLSOC. Why didn't they help them host the tournaments to raise awareness and popularity of League in the Oceanic region? I'm guessing Riot's only going to get as much attention from their servers as Riot's willing to put into them.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-03-06T02:40:08.911+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Doin Rocks,\n\nI can talk about the point you bought up about UNSW LoLSoc.

Even for hardware purchased locally, the currency risk you mention is often built in at a supplier level - ie. they take into account the cost of purchasing a piece of equipment overseas and delivering it to the AU market. \n\nThat means that a reasonable portion of our operational costs for our platform actually are in USD.
