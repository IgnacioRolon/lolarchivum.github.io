I honestly cannot understand this, irelias kit is set up in such a way that the addition of that single item instantly gives her such a massive power spike that its makes needing to 3v1 or 4v1 her the only way to bring her back into heel. and if you cant control her after she buys that one item, she just snowballs to a point where shes able to carry a game with next to no effort...\nwhile I understand that at higher level play she is somewhat counterable, she just seems to be impossibly powerful when playing anywhere below platinum and diamond. it would be nice if she got a nerf, just something that balanced her out a bit, I just want to be able to go up against an irelia without my first thought being &quot;welp, this game is lost, might as well forfeit&quot;, I even make sure to ban her whenever I get the chance in ranked...\nSo I want to ask what others think about this, I mean, if you guys have some tips for fighting her I would be quite thankful but I honestly want your thoughts on whether or not Irelia needs a nerf and what would actually be a good way to go about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-01T23:21:36.394+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"One Cannot simply...\n\nNerf Irelia","replies":[{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-11-01T23:41:15.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talon12,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=Qe9EhFh4,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-11-01T23:21:36.394+0000)\n>\n> One Cannot simply...\n> \n> Nerf Irelia\n\nthats a pretty dank meme there","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-01T23:54:00.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot tried, riot failed.

She has a strong mid game and a pretty good laning phase but her damage falls off and she isn't as impactful in teamfights as other Top laners are, not to mention playing her well actually requires practice and a good mind for the game.\n\nShe's a really strong duelist which is why you're having so much trouble.
