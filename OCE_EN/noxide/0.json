We played at the same time roughly but were solo que.\r\nJust wondering if anyone is getting good win ratio like i did and still getting placed it low bronze elo.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-01-29T02:53:04.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your MMR has been around low bronze for over a month, the placement just put you in a rank that reflects that.
