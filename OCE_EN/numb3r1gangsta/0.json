I have fixed a few of these issues for my friends before so I can safely say that you can try out my method :). I am happy to use my time to help players like you to get back into playing League without any issues :P . We don't want any players to afk or disconnect in game right hahah. \n\nOk so first method would be go into ''My Computer'' and then right click on a white empty space and then click properties. After that In the left panel, click “Advanced system settings”. Then,  In the Performance section, click the “Settings” button. The dialog box shown in the figure below will open. Make sure the “Visual Effects” tab is selected. From this point select ''Adjust for best performance'' . Remove or add checks to items according to your preference and then hit apply and then hit ok. \n\nIf this did not solve your problem please let me know :).","replies":[]}]}
