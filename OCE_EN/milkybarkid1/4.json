I know that after one of these items you would go full tank, or if your really ahead just get more damage for the lols which I have done after being stupidly ahead numerous times. I want to know the pros and cons of picking each of those items, or any other alternative item that works? What would be the best choice for Trundle? I usually go with BORK because i love the attack speed for split pushing and the active slow on it to stick to your enemy, but are any items more optimal on Trundle?\r\n\r\nPost your opinions ty {{champion:48}}","replies":[{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-07-13T01:07:11.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like {{item:3078}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-07-12T18:31:03.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Disclaimer: I don't main Trundle (I'm not expert) and have only played 16 games with him.**\n\nMatch History here: http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-history/NA/38509083?champion=48\n\nI've never tried {{item:3078}}  just because I think the item is cheap and super powerful on everyone. I imagine it would be a great pick **once** you finish it.\nThe problem with rushing Trinity Force is that its expensive and takes quite awhile to finish in the \"normal\" circumstance; not stomping your lane opponent.\nIt has great synergy with Chomp (Q), like any auto attack modifying ability Wukong Q, Irelia Q, Rengar Q, Nasus Q, etc. So I wouldn't classify it at all as a \"horrible\" item on Trundle. Rage passive lets you kite the enemy top laner and chase people down really quickly with the Pillar and Frozen Ground. You can also benefit from all of its statistics; Trundle's ultimate as you might have already noticed has AP scaling.\nPhage and Sheen work perfectly with Chomp (Q). \n\n{{item:3153}} Is pretty awesome of Trundle. I think it's a core on him because of his very heavy reliance on basic attacks. Trundle has trouble at getting kited by ADCs and what not and this helps a little bit. It's a tank killing item as well, goes well with your ultimate might as well be in the ability. \n\n{{item:3074}} is great but it doesn't give attack speed. It's still a good item on him because basic attacks. The item is really just for splitpushing and for AoE damage that Trundle lacks. I usually couple this with BotRK for epic duelling potential during lane phase because Trundle has very tank-like base stats already. Sometimes, when versing a counter/ranged champion {{champion:67}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:133}} etc I leave it out in favour of tank items. \nIf you're jungling with Trundle I'd take the Tiamat part *really* early for the clear speed.\n\nIn saying these. Keep in mind **everything is situational!** Don't follow a single build path because games change and things happen. \n____\nIf you're wondering why I took needlessly large rod or any hard AP items on a match, it's because I was stomping the match and was fooling around with trying to optimise my ult.

Spirit Visage is practically a must.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-12T16:10:46.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hydra\nPro: AoE split push\nCon: Less dueling power\n\nBotRK\nPro: Massive Dueling power\nCon: Less split push power (negligible given your trundle)\n\nTriforce is one i can't really think as to why you'd buy it unless your super ahead and planning to go 2 offense items then tank.","replies":[]}]}
