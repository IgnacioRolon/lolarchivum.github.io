Why does this happen to me ? Where are my gold/ silver team mates how can i possibly climb when the match making system curses me like this? http://apollo-uploads-oce.s3.amazonaws.com/1434808209/qtf.png","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-06-20T16:16:22.779+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bet you wouldn't make a thread like this if they were on the enemy team though.
