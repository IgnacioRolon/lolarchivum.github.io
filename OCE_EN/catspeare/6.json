(I know i will instabuy it if it comes out) \n - Takes a new perspective of Ryze\n - An aesthetically pleasing skin of Ryze, unlike most of the others (Besides White-Beard and Dark Crystal) \n - Another skin on a cheap champion who&#039;s increasingly more played (Thus more people would be looking at skins) \n\nHope you see this! \n\n~Catspeare {{champion:13}}","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-06-18T02:15:50.646+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the book can be his journal...","replies":[{"poster":"Catspeare","date":"2016-06-18T10:15:04.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OMG OR THE SKULL FROM HAMLET.
