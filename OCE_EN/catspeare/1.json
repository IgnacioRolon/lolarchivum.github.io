After the game, my computer crashed, which was odd so i just left to watch some T.V. When i tried to log in today, every-time after i logged into my account, nothing would load and my whole computer would completely freeze. The only way i could fix it was restarting it, which I&#039;ve tried about 10 times now. There&#039;s a link i found here: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/NemiGuOG-after-logging-in-lol-freezes-my-entire-computer-client \r\nThis sounds exactly like my problem however it&#039;s fix didn&#039;t help me. \r\nAny tips would be great, I&#039;ve tried re-installing it and the like already, no help.","replies":[{"poster":"Catspeare","date":"2016-03-14T11:02:44.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To anyone who has the same problem, i solved it by right clicking the LOL shortcut, going to properties, compatibility and running it on windows 7. I also made the LOL run on admin. It would come up the same however after waiting 2 minutes the problem was resolved. \n~Catspeare","replies":[]},{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-14T06:04:57.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThis definitely sounds odd, could you provide me with the exact error from that blue screen you received?\nhttp://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/40108/how-to-use-event-viewer/\n\nWhile you're at it, could you locate the latest dmp file (By default in C:\\windows\\minidump) and attach it in an email to **oce-wrenchmen@googlegroups.com** for me, please also include a link to your thread in the email.","replies":[]}]}
