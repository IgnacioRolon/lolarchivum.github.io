His village was massacred by a Noxian army when he was only at the age of three, his mother abandoned him at a river bank in order for him to survive. Soon a swordsman found him and raised as his own son, he taught him the art of Tenmetsu Ken. Takeo was a fast learner and at the time of the second Ionian-Noxian war, at the age of fourteen Takeo become an assassin for the Ionian council. \n\nHe was swift as he flashed his blade leaving only a trail of carcasses left to rot, his only motive was to kill in order for Ionia to be at peace. One day he found out the captain in charge of the destruction of his village, he set out at night but blind in vengeance. With one cut he decapitated his life however he soon found out he was a father of a family who was striving to survive and he would do anything to keep them alive. Takeo felt ashamed of what he has done but soon continued his killings but with a heavy amount of regret. \n\nAfter the Ionian-Noxian war, Takeo was commended for his actions but he felt guilty for killing a countless number of victims with his blade and cause of this he vowed to never kill again as he abandoned his sword to replace it with a dull blade as a reminder. He heard many folktales of a man corrupted with demons that traveled all over Ionia to every shrine for reconciliation and purification. Takeo set out his pilgrimage to every shrine in Ionia for atonement but when trouble comes in his path, he is ready. \n\n&ldquo;There are many things one would erase from their past, but it&rsquo;s their actions now that count&rdquo; \n-Takeo\n\nAbilities\nHeaven’s Grace (Passive) –After spell cast, Takeo becomes invulnerable for 0.25 seconds. \nFlashing Blade (Q) – Performs a slash while dashing but if he hits an enemy champion, he will perform another slash on that same enemy champion.\nPiercing Slashes (W) –Takeo builds up damage for every three attacks dealt on an enemy unit and is unable to perform on an affected enemy unit for a few seconds. \nWhirling Blade (E) – Performs a spin knocking enemies away and stunning them if they hit a wall.\nFinal Technique (R) – Takeo dashes to an enemy and performs a combo leaving them stunned.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-05-29T07:12:29.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Passive: Either too OP due to having it timed on spell casts which I feel is far to long or everything else is OP due to really short spell casts\nQ: So basically Riven Q without the dash? Basically a Diana passive? Really original…\nW: Gragas W + movement speed? Okay…\nE: Really boring and incredibly underwhelming, most dashes can go across walls, but unless he has a ‘further’ cast range because of the walls, well okay I guess that can be then in turn overpowered since I can imagine him leaping towards a wall, and walking ‘straight’ across it like a Bard Magical Journey. Also, then the name of it is really unfitting\nR: So are those dashes manual? Are they location based skillshot AoEs or single targeted? How many charges do you get from this? I’m assuming Takeo is only invulnerable as he performs the dash so either it has a normal cast time which makes passive incredibly overpowered or it’s dashes are near instant to make the passive not overpowered.\n\nThe biggest problem I see in this kit is it’s passive, since either you’re gonna have to make the ‘casting’ really obvious (lets say some cast time into the actual casting time) for opponents to have some sort of counterplay or warning before he goes invulnerable. Also, if his basic abilities all proc his passive, they must have really short casting times as to not make his passive too OP. Plus, since they should need shorter casting times, the invulnerable timers would be even more unpredictable and sudden or choppy. Because of this, the only other ‘way’ to keep it’s originality (which is near none by the way for reasons you’ll see soon) is to make it so that it’s a fixed time on a fixed cooldown which can be manually triggered by abilities. Lets say Takeo can proc his passive to become invulnerable for 1 second 0.25 seconds after casting an ability; has a fixed cooldown of 10 seconds or something. See now this is where balancing comes in and forces originality out of it, because Vi has this passive but in the form of a health shield. \n\nI would really remake his passive. It’s a good idea, but isn’t really that practical. All his other abilities seem a tad boring in all honesty, except his ultimate which I’m only imagining is as fun as I think it is, and his E which I am only imagining it works similar to his own personal Bard Journey.","replies":[{"poster":"Star Tear","date":"2016-06-05T07:16:15.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Updated skills","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-05-28T10:32:46.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, it sounds like a kit that Yasuo should have.","replies":[]}]}
