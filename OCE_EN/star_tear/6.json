The mages of Ionia saw him as a threat as he cannot be killed by normal beings and decided to seal him inside his blade. The mages used all their power to seal Kokai inside his blade and succeeded, they decided to hide the blade from human existence as the blade cannot be broken. Couple of years later a man founded the blade under rubble, Kokai spoke to the man offering a deal to harvest the souls of mortal beings with the blade in exchange for what the man desires. The man accepted and used the blade to kill Noxian soldiers and harvest their souls, the man harvested enough souls only to find out he was tricked. Kokai used those souls to corrupt the man, soon Kokai was inside the body of the man and massacred the man&#039;s army and harvested their souls. Kokai was eager to continue his ambition to enslave mortal beings and to harvest the power off worthy opponents.\n\n&quot;What is a man? A man is just feeble cattle waiting for their soul to be harvested same with the rest of the herd.&quot; -Kokai\n\n_**Quotes**_\nUpon Selection\n\"(Laugh)...
