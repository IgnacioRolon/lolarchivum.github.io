After some time I have decided to the play the game again as my friend wanted my help. I decided  I would reinstall it. I knew that I had installed it again some time a go   so I deleted that bugged copy and decided to reinstall it. After deleting it I thought installing the game would work. It said I still had one copy of it. I went in to the control panel and attempted to delete this &quot;copy&quot; of the game. It said that &quot;This option is only valid for programmes that are currently installed.&quot; I tried again and it still would not work. I did look up how to fix the problem. I attempted going in to regedit as lots of people had recommended to others I did that and got rid of my LoL folder so that there was no remnance of it. I go to install the game, but once more there is another copy of it! I go in to the control panel and there is the thing I could not uninstall. I cannot uninstall it at the moment. Does anybody know a way to fix this problem? I would be very grateful if you could help me! \r\nCheers{{item:3031}}","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-08T08:36:14.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"When you went to edit your registry, did you edit the value that says to the control panel that you still have the program installed?\n\nAs for a possible quick fix to this, try running a registry cleaner on your computer. It should automatically detect any key entries that refer to a program that isn't installed and remove them for you. Try CCleaner, I've heard good things from it.","replies":[{"poster":"luk2631","date":"2015-05-11T08:53:58.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the advice.

There's no way any remnant of League could be left over after that.\n\nBut you probably don't want to do that because 1. you most likely don't have a physical disc with the OS on it (from Windows 7 and beyond I believe they started doing this) and 2. you have things on your computer you'd like to keep. An extreme alternative would be to split your hard-drive into two partitions and dual-boot so that you can install League on one system. But that's a waste of resources.\n\nAn alternative is to search for the term \"League\" in your registry editor and delete all keys/strings referring to the program. Since it's already uninstalled it shouldn't cause any extra issues. You've gotta try basically anything now.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
