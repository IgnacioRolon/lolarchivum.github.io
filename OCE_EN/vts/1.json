Orianna, Anivia, Xerath and Assassins as in Katarina, LeBlanc and Zed.\r\n\r\nI feel like I cannot carry or at least work with the team as assassins, especially as Zed and Leblanc. Sure, I know i can win my lane easily but in the long run and when it comes to teamfighting, after killing someone, I feel almost useless and my team gets completely shut up. This is compared with my impact as I play caster champions, whom I feel like I help alot of teamfights, can win as a team and feels overall more consistent.\r\n\r\nAm I playing assassin mids wrong or are they naturally unreliable to main?\r\n\r\nI conclude with the mindset that assassin games give me a 50/50 chance to win, either I stomp or get stomped whereas caster mids are more consistent over multiple games.\r\n\r\nAnyone have any thoughts, can add to this to help me decide which type of mid I should play as?\r\n\r\nP.S, I enjoy playing any of those champions, but I do like the assassin mids to play. However, I would much prefer to climb than to have my champion pool as an image.","replies":[{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2017-12-28T23:24:31.275+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the lethality is getting absolutely nuts atm, go assasins","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-12-29T00:22:35.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are two situations here that need to be considered.\n\n1. **In theory.** \n2. **In practice.**\n\n**In theory**, \nmages are the safe pick, their utility and reliable damage means they have a larger impact on the game as a whole. Assassins in theory are feast or famine, they are a high-risk/high-reward pick. So unless you are really good at the assassin, and your team comp can support the loss of sustained AP damage, mages are generally the safer pick.\n\n**In practice**, \nit's totally the other way around, Assassins are extremely snowbally, 1 kill in lane pretty much wins them all future fights, and their kits are designed to get them kills in lane. \nThe thing you have to consider is what each role is supposed to do; a mage provides a constant barrage of damage to the enemy team. An assassin's job is to take out the high priority target. When the enemy team is not fed the mage does more damage because the tanks can't act as the meat-shields they are supposed to be, which makes the mage's job easier. When the enemy team is fed, the tanks can take pretty much anything, making the mage completely useless. When the enemy team isn't fed, an assassin can jump on and 1-hit the ADC, and when the enemy is fed, the assassin can still jump on and 1-hit the ADC, because ADC's don't really get any tankier wether they are fed or not, and as an assassin you're always going to have a bucketload of damage.\n\n________________\n\nWhen you're behind as a mage, you will get out damaged by other champs so they will kill you before you can kill them. When you're behind as an assassin, you'll still get all of your damage out quicker then the enemy can get theirs out.\n\nSo in theory, mages are more reliable. But in practice, assassins always retain their ability to do the job they are supposed to do, when mages fall off when the enemy gets stronger making their job harder and harder to accomplish.\n\nPlus, this meta revolves entirely around 1-hitting everyone else. which is pretty much what assassins were built for. So take from that what you will...\n\n\nBut if you want a nice image?\nAs long as you steer clear of Yasuo you might be alright, but still, all champs have reputations, and Zed and Kat player's ones are not pretty.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-12-28T14:38:01.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The unfortunate side effect of league right now, is that the meta is going to be volatile and probably won't settle much until at least the start of the new season.\n\nAnd unfortunately, you'd have to gamble on what's being meta if you want to focus on only maining one of those groups.\n\nMages however do tend to be the more consistent through all meta's because while Assassin mid's do fall out in certain meta's Mage's tend not to fall out as hard.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Green Bast3rd","date":"2017-12-28T14:19:25.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I voted mages and here's why right now I think it's far better to control the team fights and laning phase than with assassins. You can siege towers far better and also you can provide cc for your support and adc. I can't count the number of times that I have saved an adc's life because I chose to cc the enemy frontline so that they could melt them. Or cc an enemy assassin who is now stuck in the middle of your team. Really it all comes down to playstyle as well, if you work well with assassins and you have good situational awareness you can pull off some crazy stuff. However, I feel like assassins are really good at securing and taking kills which can put all your gold on one player. If you look at korean stats you can tell that for solo q Taliyah was the highest played champion because she could control enemy movements. Also if you'd like a good youtuber to watch for tips I recommend Phylol, he offers very good guides for which champions are good and which are not. Overall though it really depends on you not only choosing which champions to go with but to essentially narrow down your champion pool to five main champs. For example, I started in bronze 2 in NA on my main, I played Veigar because he worked with me at the time and I've loved him since season 2. I have over 100 games on my main account in NA, I am now Gold 4 and on top of all that my win rate with Veigar is over 75%. This is similar to other champions that I play, I kept my eyes on mid and I kept my pool small and because of that, I climbed pretty fast. Either way good luck!
