Anyways I hope you enjoy what I have so far and glfh to all the other participants. EXACTLY 1500 WORDS ITS YA BOY Anyways the main concept for this story kinda takes place after Jinx&#039;s lore where she blows up town hall with pew pew guns. But it also engraves the debonair skin concept in as well which is quite interesting. Although I rarely mention it in the story, Vi, Jayce, Galio and Ez are indeed wearing the respective debonair outfits during their time at the club. Thanks for reading btw. eks dee. Draft Number 1~~~~~~~~\n_\n\nSomething was amiss within the famous City of Progress, though Vi and Caitlyn couldn&rsquo;t quite place their fingers on it. It was painful as their co-workers watched on and felt pity for the Sheriff and Vi who were fixed on another vandalism directed towards City Hall, undoubtedly the work of The Loose Cannon, Jinx. The accusation was yet to be authenticated by the Sheriff and for almost two weeks now, the dynamic duo had squabbled and bickered over sending out parties in ambition for capturing Jinx. \n&ldquo;We lack evidence, it would be ruthless to just start sending out parties to search for her. A dead man&rsquo;s dream to go and waste our comrades, while they could be focusing on more important tasks at hand.&rdquo;\n&ldquo;What tasks Cupcake? The recent knock down of Town Hall was a message; a message to us, mocking us and you expect me to just sit here and feed the ducks?&rdquo; Vi proclaimed, voice straining as she stood from her table and in the process, knocking over her stool. Caitlyn tilted her head down in shame, allowing her hat to drape over her eyes, in attempt to avoid Vi&rsquo;s glare. To their left, the small doorbell tinkled and in, proudly strolled Jayce, The Defender of Tomorrow and by his side, eyes sharp stood Ezreal, The Prodigal Explorer. \n&ldquo;Vi! Sheriff! Long time no see&rdquo;, Jayce greeted warmly as he lifted out his hand for Vi to take.\n&ldquo;Yea, we should&rsquo;ve kept it that way&rdquo;, she growled pushing away his hand, &ldquo;So what brings two lovely gentlemen such as yourselves here?&rdquo;\n&ldquo;We,&rdquo; Ezreal hesitated as he glimpsed around the room, as if in search of some type of guidance, &ldquo;Received a call and think you two should spend some time off work.&rdquo; A chuckle arouse from Caitlyn and a snort from Vi. \n&ldquo;Who would have been as simple minded to believe that we needed time off?&rdquo; Asked the still giggling Caitlyn.\n&ldquo;Details like those would be a waste of breath to explain, we really think you both should relax a little, even if just for a night. It&rsquo;s clear that you&rsquo;ve both been overworking yourselves way too much.\n&ldquo;Not a chance in hell. &rdquo; Vi remarked, pulling off her gauntlets and placing them on the workbench, revealing her pale, toned hands which then proceeded to pick up a glass of water and raise it to her lips. \n&ldquo;Vi it wasn&rsquo;t a request, we&rsquo;ve already planned the preparations for you and the Sheriff to take one night off and just enjoy yourselves for the sake of tomorrow&rsquo;s Piltover!&rdquo; Vi sputtered as she choked on her water. \n&ldquo;Apologies Jayce, we&rsquo;re already in the midst of an overwhelming case and so far, we&rsquo;ve gathered little to no evidence. Taking a few nights off just for our health and benefit would surely endanger Piltover even more than it already is. Now with all due respect please be ever so kind and leave. Vi and I have a case to solve.&rdquo; At this point, Caitlyn had rose from her cozy armchair and began to nudge Jayce and Ezreal out the front door. Caitlyn halted to a stop in her dismisses as the soft voice of a trainee officer spoke up,\n&ldquo;W-we really think you two should take some time off..You&rsquo;ve done more than enough to help with this case but we can handle it from here&rdquo; This sparked a murmur of yeses in the room emitting from the fellow officers. Caitlyn and Vi, troubled, turned their necks and glimpsed at each worker, searching for nods of approval, then towards each other. Vi shrugged, Caitlyn followed with a sigh, &ldquo;One night&rdquo;.\n&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s settled! Alright, Vi get changed&rdquo; Jayce declared as he tossed her a white suit and a slick cover for her gauntlets still packaged and freshly new.\n&ldquo;For you&rdquo; Ezreal broadly smiled at Caitlyn as he handed her an explicit, revealing maid outfit. Caitlyn took one long glimpse at it before shoving it back into the young explorer&rsquo;s attractive face and announce &ldquo;I&rsquo;d much rather you wear it Ezreal, you would excite so many citizens of Demacia, notably the Lady of Luminosity.&rdquo;\nEzreal laughed the comment off before scratching his head and bowing in embarrassment. As Vi and Caitlyn made their way up to the higher levels of the police headquarters to change into respectable material for their night out, Jayce bellowed \n&ldquo;The Piltover Dollhouse Club at 8pm, Galio will be waiting for you at the entrance! We&rsquo;ll see you there&rdquo; And with that, the front doorbell tinkled once more to signal their leave.\n\nAnd so 8pm came, Vi and Caitlyn arrived dressed in fancy attire; Vi wore a stunning white princess vest, over a denim blue long sleeved shirt and slim black trousers. Her gauntlets were covered with a smooth and metallic fabric that followed the same theme. Her hair,  slicked back into a low ponytail with one strand of hair that stood out at front. Caitlyn rid of her hat, wore an elegant purple party dress, which hugged her fronts showing off her elegant figure. The back of the dress lightly exposed as the fabric wove down from her fully covered spine into a V shape which mimicked the back of Vi&rsquo;s vest. Bits of fabric lines lay on the sides of Caitlyn&rsquo;s thighs serving to connect the front of the dress to the back and lastly, Caitlyn&rsquo;s pale, untouched, muscular legs were presented through a light violet stocking that clung to the black, leather thigh belts on each of her legs. She finished the look with light makeup and her trusty rifle which posed as an accessory, not to mention the purple high heels she wore. As the pair strolled to the entrance of the club, Galio, The Sentinel&#039;s Sorrow,  dressed in similar fashion to Vi, greeted them and allowed them access into the nightclub. Caitlyn was immediately parted from Vi as her fellow co-workers dragged her off to &lsquo;dance&rsquo;, but knowing the Sheriff, she most likely would&rsquo;ve just walked around patrolling the club showing little interest in swaying her hips and wooing some male..not while her partner, in more than just crime, was here. Wink wink. Back to Vi, who was already swaggering through the crowds making her way to the VIP room, where no doubt she would find Ezreal and Jayce. She didn&rsquo;t knock, but instead opened the door and slammed it with such force all those in the room turned their heads. She paused and peered.\n&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you patrolling outside? Galio?&rdquo; Vi asked with a face of pure grouch.\n&ldquo;A guardian is always prepared. My shift has ended&rdquo; Vi nodded as she strolled into the room, onto the couch not even bothering to shut the door. She lazily sat down, legs spread and arms leaned forward on the table. The last game of poker had ended quickly upon Vi&rsquo;s arrival and Ezreal, to pass time, was chatting to a few of the women who crowded him. \n&ldquo;Deal me in&rdquo; Vi demanded and so they did. They played for a for a decent two hours, discussing current affairs, relationships and so forth until Caitlyn walked in, dressed as elegant and as she had hours prior. Her figure left those in the room in awe and Ezreal, who had been sipping on a bottle of champagne and now reeked of alcohol, proudly strolled up to Caitlyn who stood motionless and watched in amusement. His next few attempts at smooth talking her failed miserably and was cut short as Vi interrupted, motioning Caitlyn to sit on her lap. \n&ldquo;Oh please, like you&rsquo;re any better Vi&rdquo;. Vi didn&rsquo;t bother hiding her grin before chuckling out loud. Vi&rsquo;s laugh was swiftly replaced by a psychotic cackle emitting from outside, causing her to snarl in dismay as realization hit her. The Sheriff, looked from Vi and paced to the window. She scanned the scenery only to be greeted with an awfully familiar silhouette no doubt where the sound originated from. \n&ldquo;Jayce, Ezreal, Vi let&rsquo;s go. Galio, remain in the building and protect the citizens, evacuate if you must&rdquo; the Sheriff commanded. The four didn&rsquo;t question Caitlyn and the battle that was to commence, the ear piercing shriek from earlier answered their questions. The four sprinted to the front door of the pub, gently yet forcibly pushing and nudging past the oblivious partying citizens of Piltover. Once outside of the pub, the foursome made their way to the hidden warehouse sat comfortably behind the nightclub. And before them, stood Jinx, the Loose Cannon. \n&ldquo;Good to see you, Jinx&rdquo; Caitlyn glared sternly. Jinx hugged her stomach and fell on the floor laughing and bellowing, before getting back on her feet and staring at the four with such darkness and glow in her eyes as she aligned her left hand up directly to the level of Caitlyn&rsquo;s nose, pulling back her pinky and ring finger and making a gun gesture. \n&ldquo;BOOM! Headshot!&rdquo; She snickered and then screaming could be heard from within the pub.\n {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2017-03-21T06:54:01.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"evacuate if u must\"\n\nTRIGGERED","replies":[{"poster":"OkamiChii","date":"2017-03-21T11:17:14.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"BLESSED BE JESUS THANKS","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-03-21T00:07:51.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A foursome eh? kinky.","replies":[{"poster":"OkamiChii","date":"2017-03-21T00:36:30.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"gOD","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-03-21T06:37:06.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sadly thats against the rules of the comp","replies":[{"poster":"OkamiChii","date":"2017-03-21T11:15:43.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SCREECH","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MonsterMasher","date":"2017-03-21T05:32:58.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Noice","replies":[]},{"poster":"Philip Locke","date":"2017-03-20T05:49:58.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
