I have been reporting as much as I can but nothing changed. Yesterday this game I linked the match history, the zed never bought items and constantly walked to feed enemies. It was very frustrating and unenjoyable gaming experience. So I sat in fountain, not insult anybody, waited until the game is over. After the game I got punished for refusing to play that game!!! I need to wait 10min to play another one?! If bots are a problem, which it is by the numerous accounts of player reports of third party leveling, you deal with the problem! Not force a player to suffer your lemming bot party and punishing him if he refuse!!!","replies":[]}
