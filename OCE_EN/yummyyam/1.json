I am requesting for further explanation of which incidents resulted me of this disservice.\r\n\r\nBringing some background: I almost exclusively play ARAM and this is my OCE account since I came to Australia for studies. In my games I have NEVER used harsh languages or insulted players on either side. When facing trolls I usually just mute them and focus on playing the game. I checked my game history and out of those games I only recall two in which I had unpleasant teammates which may led me to be reported unfairly.\r\n\r\nOne game I was playing as Soraka and early on I commented on our Lee Sin that his aggressively Q engages may lose us the game. He instantly rebutted in all chat that I was being toxic and should be reported. I replied in all chat that I only said one sentence so far that game and it wasn&#039;t toxic at all and then muted him. We went on to win the game as I helped to keep the team healthy after skirmishes.\r\n\r\nSecond game I was playing as Nautilus, and with our team comp in mind I decided to play as AP bruiser as our team lack magic damage. Rengar said he was his first time and our Yi was aggressively trading one for ones. Our Mundo was building full tank yet he does not engage first in team fights. I was not sure if that that was because he tried to protect his kda or it was because he was a bronze player (I checked post game) and didn&#039;t understand his role. Yet Rengar and GP would flame me saying I should engage first since I have the cc regardless of low hp at certain time. I only said Mundo should engage first as he already has full tank items and I wasn&#039;t abusive in my tone. I continued playing and we also won that game.\r\n\r\nThese were the only incidents that I believe I had been reported in my past 10-15 games. In games which I play champs I am not familiar with I would say so in the pre-game chat and tried my best. Rarely in those games would I get harassed. When playing with familiar champs, I did not get negative kda in all my past games and nor was I being cocky or arrogant about it.\r\n\r\nSo I think it is fair someone from Riot explain to me this situation as I find it very unfair I am being placed on a watch list from reports by unsportsmanlike players while I did nothing to deserve it.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-02-17T14:22:10.908+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot and explain don't tend to work in the same sentence with each other.","replies":[{"poster":"YummyYam","date":"2017-02-18T00:56:53.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is true from past experience.\n\nHowever, I am simply angry. Angry that Riot as a company sided with bullies and chose to punish despite the reports were unjust. I report bot programs daily and I never get the notification I helped to clean the community. I choose to stay quiet and continue playing when facing harassment and I get punished for it? How is there justice?\n\nI have never had such outrageous action from Riot on NA or EU servers in my past 4 years of playing. Yet I get this on OCE server in 6 months, seriously WTF?!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2017-02-18T23:19:05.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Submit a ticket to Riot support and they will provide you with the chat logs](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[{"poster":"lonespecter","date":"2017-02-19T23:24:06.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for that!","replies":[]}]}]}
