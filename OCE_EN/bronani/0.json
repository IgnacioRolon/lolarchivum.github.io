The problem was that another person instantly flamed the mid laner that was going outside the of meta (even though he stated at that time he wasn&#039;t actually going to use the declared champ) and proceeded to attack the mid lane person in the chat. We tried to calm him down and explain what was going on but he continued to use vulgar language and quote &quot;Teach us all a lesson&quot;. He then hard-locked Soraka with troll summoners/runes/masteries and declared that he was going to troll/feed and there was no way we could talk him out of it because he was &quot;teaching us a lesson&quot;.\r\n Not wanting to lose one of the fellow summoners said that they would dodge so we didn&#039;t have to endure the game/toxic player and take a loss. I don&#039;t see how its fair whatsoever that the person that dodged for the greater good of the rest of us is the one to be punished and the one that was toxic and trolled gets off scot free without anyway for the rest of us to report and have them disciplined. \r\n Perhaps allowing summoners to dodge a set amount of games per month/season would put somewhat of a bandaid fix on this issue i don&#039;t know. Do you guys think it would be fair to have a set amount of dodges similar to the re-roll system in aram to avoid this problem?. But there definitely needs to be some viable way of reporting these kind of players without having to go through the entire game.\r\n This is definitely not the first time i&#039;ve come across this, but this was such an extreme case i felt i needed to voice it here.","replies":[{"poster":"Bronani","date":"2016-04-17T04:02:40.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that a few of you are missing the point. I don't know why mid declared blitz but locked kat. What I am stating is that i'm against **ALL** types of champ select trolling, especially ranked. This was just one example and i reckon there needs to be some sort of way for players to avoid these kind of situations without having to sit through the entire game with someone toxic and more than likely lose just to report them. That seems a little unfair to the players doing the right thing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-04-17T02:05:24.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lesson is pretty simple, if you don't fool around in champ select, there's less incentive for kiddies with no balls to troll.
