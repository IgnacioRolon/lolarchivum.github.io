The reason i ask this is because I&#039;ve recently played 4 bot games and in 2 of them I&#039;ve had bots. One was sat on the opposite side of the wall from krugs with turrets with him continually making the krugs aggro, then losing it to patience and not killing them for an entire game, and I just had an amumu and graves bot who played like the bots we were playing against. Now it doesn&#039;t really effect my game play experience but I was just curious as those accounts are most likely going to be sold. I thought the system caught them out quite quickly but apparently they can get to level 30 without being banned.","replies":[{"poster":"atroquinine","date":"2016-05-17T05:37:53.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ive had this same problem myself when levelling smurfs (manually). generally i just drop a report and leave a description of the obvious bot-like behaviour and trust theyll get banned pre30","replies":[]}]}
