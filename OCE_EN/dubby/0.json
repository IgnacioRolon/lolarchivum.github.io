I can play games just fine and access the store but as soon as it comes to hextech crafting i get disconnected. anyone help?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-18T03:19:59.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nI've been asked to have you and anyone else experiencing this issue submit logs and a ticket regarding it.\n\nYou'll have to download the [Hextech Toolkit](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/player-support/tools/HTK_Setup.msi) for me, select your region and run it with the default settings.\n\nYour logs should be saved to your Desktop as LoL-Logs.zip, please [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) describing your error to Player Support and attach that file with your ticket to ensure support receives all necessary information.","replies":[]},{"poster":"gathixpower","date":"2016-04-17T07:51:11.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Save issue here. There were quite a few threads on this topic, but no real solution has been found. I even tried it on a fresh Windows install and still getting the same issues, I think it's a problem server side.","replies":[{"poster":"Dubby","date":"2016-04-17T08:45:11.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i agree, I think it's a server issue aswell, because i can play games perfectly fine but when it comes to crafting, it doesnt want to co-operate at all. :/ thanks for letting me know though!","replies":[]}]}]}
