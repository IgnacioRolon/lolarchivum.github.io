The elo system is trying to bring that down to 50% so they match you with better players. Riot is literally stacking the deck against you. Win streaks also enhance this.\n\nThe same applies for loss streaks though, so you should start winning some games after this loss streak is done.\n\nSo yeah, someone is trying to make you loose solo queue. It's Riot XD","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-19T09:14:18.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"(You realize that a guy got to challenger with a 80% win rate yeah?)","replies":[{"poster":"noogai","date":"2015-12-19T09:28:08.087+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"People like faker are an exception to the rule. In statistics, one person out of a thousand is considered an outlier, and therefore irrelevant to any actual conclusions that can be drawn from said statistics.\n\nThe rule as it is, is Riot balances the game around players having a 50% win rate. at 50% win rate, you will still climb, but slowly. If you do much better in your games, win a lot in a row and get, say, 60% win rate, your MMR will start to spike, matching you with better players. If you beat them, your MMR climbs even higher. However, that doesn't disprove when he said. Riot will actively (through the MMR system) try to keep your win rate at 50%. If you get higher than that, you are OBVIOUSLY better than whatever MMR/Division you are in, and evntually you will either climb to the division you should be at, or you will lose to better players, get a loss streak and drop MMR and winrate.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DANISH WONDERBOY","date":"2015-12-19T06:59:11.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just wanted to clarify that this is a smurf account, I know how mmr works lol.

This wasn't only Ranked, but I had won 6 games in a row playing only jungle like 2 or 3 days ago. Then yesterday and today I lose all my games, ending up on 8-loss streak, ranked and normals alike.\n\n It was literal cancer, some of the players I was matched with. I got ganked by nidalee as a Vladimir top against a volibear. I nearly escaped them, but voli flash-q'd me and I died. Then what does rengar do? Tries to kill the nidalee 1v1, get's her low, but voli comes, so he flashs to kill the nidalee, and dies to the voli too. Doesn't speak for the entire game after saying \"Damn, sorry\"\nHardlife","replies":[]}]}]}
