So I recently completed my provisionals for 2015, having won 8/10 I figure I should be placed reasonably well I also have a platinum friend that said &quot;you should get at least high silver for that&quot; I was placed in Bronze 2 -.- ... I should say I was bronze 1 last season however, what really pissed me off was that I have a friend that won 3/10 and got Bronze 1!! And another that won 2/10 and got Bronze 2. To further my point I don&#039;t have low MMR, in bronze 2 I gain 30 for a win and I lost 9 LP for losing. If someone could explain how this works and why I was placed in Bronze 2 when I won 8/10 provisionals that would be great. Also I&#039;m in silver 5 now however I would love for someone to elaborate on my question. \r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\nChillstep!!","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-29T12:36:05.118+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">I was placed in Bronze 2 -.- ...

And another that won 2/10 and got Bronze 2. \n\nNeither of these actually give us an idea of two things;\nThe order of win's/losses\nWhat rank they were last season.\n\n\nHere's why you placed low;\nLast season 2 of your top played champs were 20% win rate and 13% win rate, and honestly none of your champs had a massive amount of wins on them, so i'd say it's safe to bet you probably had a low MMR to begin with.\n\nThis season you probably started with a Bronze 3-4 MMR due to being a low MMR B1, and your order of win's losses was as follows;\n\n2W > L > 6W > L\n\nYou also in this 6W streak seem to have been duo'd for at least 2 with a bronze 2 (and a loss with the same person which lowers you faster) and at least 1 game with a bronze 4 (this affects the amount you can get pushed up as he was the lower MMR)\n\nSo with one of your losses being early, and duoing likely being involved, your actually probably sitting slightly higher then i would have guessed for an 8-2.\n\nEDIT:\n>having won 8/10 I figure I should be placed reasonably well I also have a platinum friend that said \"you should get at least high silver for that\"\n\na) did you tell said plat what rank you were last season?\nb) just because they are plat doesn't mean they understand the mechanics behind the game or that they had all the info behind your ranking, cause i just dredged up this stuff with a half ass check.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spadestar","date":"2016-01-01T20:47:09.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went 2/10 and got silver 5","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-03-29T20:17:45.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know the feeling, the first time i played ranked i won 4 of my provisionals, and got bronze 3, the next season i won 4 again and got placed in bronze 3 again, then i worked my way up to bronze 1, and fell back to bronze 2 a day or two before the season ended, and in the pre-season got back to bronze 1 and finished with a 5 game winning streak (which cant have hurt my MMR) then this season i did my provisionals and won 5 (more than ever before) and got placed in bronze 4 (the lowest i have ever been) i literally just cant understand what is going on, and when i asked riot support how the placement matches work (not asking to change anything, just wanting to know for next time) and they couldn't give me an answer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-29T12:11:14.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"More than just win/loss ratio goes into consideration for where you get placed.
