I've taken my GF to many places last year such as Japan, England, Dubai and Singapore, but for the last trip we made for new year I wanted to do something romantic for her, and Bali was a perfect choice.\n\nThere's plenty things to do there, the few things we did was swimming in our private pool, diving along the coral reef, shopping for her, plenty cocktails and \"other things\". We both had a great time and I would recommend that you guys do the same, you won't be disappointed ;)","replies":[]}
