All the geometry all the models all the terrain and pathing has all been completely redone. It's a possibility but would be far from a priority or something they could do as a quick fun thing. The old textures would just break if you tried to put them on the new map.","replies":[{"poster":"Apathleyex","date":"2017-04-13T02:40:00.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i know it wouldnt be a priority would just be cool if they had a feature to use the old map for like a week or two but still able to use the map currently\n\nSo like URF Old map would be interesting but i know it would be difficult\nbut would be pretty interesting","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-13T10:49:32.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ye it's defs be cool, just a lot of people underestimate just how much work would go into something like that.
