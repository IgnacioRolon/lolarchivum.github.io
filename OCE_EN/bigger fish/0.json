I am Matthew 'Fish' Stewart, Shoutcaster for the OPL - Ask Me Anything!","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Guys!\n\nMy name is Matthew Stewart but some of you would better know me as Fish from the Oceanic Pro League. I am a Play by Play Shoutcaster for the OPL here at Riot OCE and I also run the [Facebook](http://facebook.com/oceanicproleague) &amp; [Twitter](http://twitter.com/opl) channels for the OPL! (Who let the dyslexic guy run Social Media. >.<)\n\n**What I did/do!**\nI initially moved to Riot OCE to shoutcast the LPL before moving to the OPL team. Before that, I spent time as an Actor for a popular YouTube channel in Singapore, Worked as a producer for the FIFA Online 3 Esports leagues in South-East Asia as well as did a lot of commentary for the Garena Premier League. Oh and I kinda studied to try and be an architect before all this. &gt;.&lt;\n\n**Video Games!**\nI&#039;ve played video games pretty much my entire life, there are pictures of me as a kid sitting on my uncle lap with a gameboy and even a hilarious tale of my parents leaving me at a kids club while on holidays to come back to a crowd watching me beat Disney Hercules on the PlayStation. \n\nMy favourite game of all time is the Halo Series, it was my bread and butter growing up with friends in Singapore. I dabbled in Runescape, Pokemon, Neopets, Warcraft 3 and a lot of console games when I was younger. I was introduced to League of Legends through a bunch of friends I met playing Street Fighter and have been playing since Renektons release! I use to play semi-professionally in Singapore and Indonesia (There are still VODs and LoL Wiki articles out there somewhere &gt;.&lt;)\n\n**Speaking of the league of legends**\nI&#039;ve hopped roles since I started:\n1st Season Mid\n2nd Season Jungle\n3rd Season Support\n4th Season ADC\n5th Season Top...\n\nBut you&#039;ll usually see me Q up for ADC or Top lane at the moment. My favourite champions are Annie, Miss Fortune and Kindred! And I even have a Kindred Tattoo!\n\nBut that&#039;s enough from me, what would you like to know? Ask me anything!","replies":[{"poster":"Iamnotverygood","date":"2017-05-19T05:32:41.573+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"How does it feel being the 2nd best PBP commentator in the OPL, and how do you think you can improve to be better than Riot Benji?","replies":[{"poster":"Bigger Fish","date":"2017-05-19T05:34:46.773+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice Try Benji.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MasterMirkinen","date":"2017-05-19T05:34:29.157+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Smurf Found!

I have actually never thought about that.\n\nAn easy one would be to say that at OCE, most of us don't just Shoutcast. Forsko does a lot of graphical work for the OOL, Raz helps organise to get styled up, Rusty works on the OOL, and much much more!\n\nBut the funniest thing I could think of would be getting changed. I can imagine that a lot of people think we rock up all styled and ready for the day looking fly and all that Jazz.\n\nNo.\n\nSpawn is mostly in his gym shorts until 20 minutes before cameras go live, I never wear any shoes, Hingers will have some crazy track pants situation going on.\n\nAnd we also have to fight over the tiniest space possible to get changed / use mirrors to do makeup! Its literally the size of a single cubicle... When pastrytime was here he use to use the glass windows as his mirror to avoid the crowd! Hingers even uses his laptop to do his makeup.\n\nAnd oh yeah... we do our own makeup. >.<","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Arcanis Guile","date":"2017-05-19T09:37:30.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since when did you finally learn to spell \"bigger\" and why did you decide to use it for your Riot handle instead of just fish or the original mispelt one?\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"Bigger Fish","date":"2017-05-22T04:35:23.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Omg its the legendary Arcanis!\n\nI never truly learnt how to spell Bigger.

This is going to kill the competition by strangling out teams like I described and we'll only see ppl who get money pumped into them and who aren't necessarily the best talent or good at the game.
