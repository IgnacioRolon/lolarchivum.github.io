There's a fine line between a little banter, and what I'm seeing in your log (of which you apparently left out some lines).\n\nHonestly, I can't believe people still use the \"you'd do the same in my shoes\" excuse. I think the break you've wholeheartedly earned should be used to reflect on yourself and your actions. I mean, yeah, maybe Yas did tell you to go kill yourself but why did you react? Two wrongs don't make a right. There was no need for you to continue chatting in game at all, if it really offended you then the best course of action would be to mute him and report after the game had finished.\n\nThe other thing that's got me confused is why you only seem to pick up on \"one to two\" hiccups. Even if your chat log is out of context half of the stuff you're saying is just not on at all anyway.\n\nI'll provide a quick breakdown for you in words you should be able to understand.\n\n\n\n**** [23:48] XXHavana (Sivir): lets run into their jg****\n****[23:50] XXHavana (Sivir): and 3v5****\n**** [23:53] XXHavana (Sivir): yeah nice****\n\nIs this the only way you can express yourself? You could have worded this in a much more constructive manner. Instead you chose to come off as sarcastic and snarky. How could you have changed this? \n\n\n\n****[23:48] XXHavana (Sivir): that might have been a misplay running into their jungle, we should try to play a little more cautiously in future.****\n\nAgain, this is merely a suggestion. However, do try it. \n\n\n\n****[16:20] [All] XXHavana (Sivir): rofl so sad****\n****[16:48] [All] XXHavana (Sivir): still sad****\n****[16:56] [All] XXHavana (Sivir): I'm enjoying this win****\n****[17:06] [All] XXHavana (Sivir): rofl****\n****[17:21] [All] XXHavana (Sivir): you have no way of winning****\n\nAt what point did you stop and think this was necessary? Again, if you were spouting this garbage in one of my games you'd be instantly muted. This is the sort of stuff that's completely unnecessary and shows nothing but poor character.\n\n\n\n****[33:56] [All] XXHavana (Sivir): this yas****\n****[33:57] [All] XXHavana (Sivir): omg****\n****[34:03] [All] XXHavana (Sivir): ahahahha****\n\nShould have just muted Yas and focused on your game.\n\n\n\n ****[32:25] [All] XXHavana (Sivir): Idc if we lose only care if you get banned now\n [32:27] [All] XXHavana (Sivir): pls report yas****\n\nWas this really necessary to say? If you care so much about someone else getting banned, despite the fact you've been just as bad as they have, then you really must reflect on yourself as a person. There's also no need to all-chat asking for a report. Most of the time it's essentially hearsay and the enemy has no real knowledge of what's going on. If in this case Yas was being toxic in all-chat then naturally he'd receive reports if the people were so inclined to do it. \n\n\nAnyway, enjoy your break. Try to take some time out to unwind and come back to the Rift with a new perspective assuming you weren't perma-banned.\n\n\nTL:DR?

Perma ban is FOURTH serious offense for one. And you keep going on about how the Yas was worse and that somehow get's you off the hook. If some kid steals a bike, and some other kid steals a car, the kid stealing the bike doesn't get off scott free just because the other kid did something worse, the one stealing the car simply gets a worse punishment. To say you should not be punished for YOUR OWN actions, because it's somehow magically someone worse's fault is a completely puerile and asinine way of looking at it. \n\nIf it was one or two games it wouldn't be a problem, you wouldn't be banned, you wouldn't have even made it on chat restriction. The system is lenient enough as it is that only the serious repeat offenders ever make it to perma bans as in you have to be excessively toxic consistently. I don't think Riot even can undo perma bans even if they wanted to so all you're doing by publicising this is showing how toxic you are to everyone on the boards. If you really want to keep playing grow up and make a new account, but if you intend to stay toxic expect it to get banned pretty quick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-10-20T00:21:46.310+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What evidence? The screenshots? Last I checked, that wasn't evidence. For one thing that doesn't even show what you said between 12:55 and 14:38, why is that I wonder? Not to mention, you could've done anything to those images before uploading them. You could've edited them to omit certain lines of text and make it look like Riot misinformed you and/or that you didn't say something you did.\n\nNot to mention, Sephyre has asked for permission to post the 12 lines of chat you omitted and still has not received it from you, so what do you think that makes it look like?

Riot forgets that their players are human. Every aspect of human emotion they have bundled into one toxic label and punish everyone for it.

He was banned for being negative/toxic, and you don't get banned for a first offence. He was in no way banned for the Yasuo's actions, and we have no way of knowing if the Yas was also banned, since riot would have seen the whole game log, they would have seen the Yas's behaviour as well and punished him accordingly. I'm not saying the system is perfect, far from it, but this game and those logs had visibility in this guys punishment, which means the Yas was seen as well. \n\nThis whole post is based under the assumption that his toxicity was the Yas's fault and that the Yas received no punishment, the former being untrue and the latter being an unknown but also likely false.\n\n(And an actual rioter looks at logs when considering perma bans so it wasn't just a case of the automated system catching his and missing the Yas's behaviour.)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2015-10-20T21:54:59.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let this one die now yea?","replies":[]}]}
