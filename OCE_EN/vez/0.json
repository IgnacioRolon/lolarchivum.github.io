You had a thriving forum and you killed it for this dead, stagnant, stale piece of &amp;%$!  While your&#039;re at it bring back the old client, the one that was EASY to navigate and didn&#039;t have this stupid chat system that NOONE USES.  HAS ANYONE EVER USED THE VOICE CHAT....??  NOONE USES THE VOICE CHAT.  There are seriously so many issues that need to be fixed I will go ahead and list them below.  FIX THE FOLLOWING\r\n- Remove new client bring back old client (keep practice tool for the noobs e.g. 98% of the players who need the practice)\r\n- Bring back old runes and mastery system (including doge runes)\r\n- Remove ALL essence\r\n- Bring back IP (I had so much of that and you deleted it all)\r\n- Remove voice chat\r\n- Bring back Riot SMK (aka Riot Bright)  she was the heart of OCE.\r\n- Bring Back Graves Cigar \r\n- Remove Loot and Loot boxes \r\n- Remove new TwistedTreeLine and bring back old TT\r\n- Remove ARAM \r\n- Bring back &#039;Sword of the Occult&#039;.  There NEEDS to be an AD equivalent item \r\n\r\nGet that done and then we can start to look at fixing the rest of the problems. \r\n\r\nFabio out.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-01-10T09:11:40.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No one uses team chat - Sometimes i have to, because my friends net is too shit to run discord, i'm sure the situation is similar for others and even if not, for those willing to accept random invites from randoms they played with before\n\nOld Runes were garbage, the only benefit they gave was a sense of personalisation which you can still do\n\nI agree on the essence, IP was much better\n\nI have no idea who Riot Bright is\n\nGraves has his cigar?\n\nLoot boxes are a waste of time absolutely, same with the new events where you have to pay to get anything decent\n\nTT hasn't changed, other than a coat of paint?\n\nARAM is fine, its good when you just wanna bludge, instead of play Ranked or Norms\n\nMejais is a cursed item, Sword was no different, remove Mejais/Seal\n\nRiot will never fix the problems with the game, they can't make money otherwise","replies":[]}]}
