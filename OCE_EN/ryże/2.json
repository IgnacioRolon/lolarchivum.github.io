I have seen the changes to my champion and i really disagree with why they would come through to live. Ryze as a champion is a battle mage with low range. If someone like a diver, bruiser, juggernaut, assassin or anyone with a little bit of health/mr and a gap closer jumps on him, he will not live. He isnt the same champion. I believe that the biggest problem with ryze at the current moment, and what makes him so hard to balance is his ratios, and his ult. If you fix/remove the mana ratios, and make him manaless, he would be easier to balance as you would only have to focus on getting the ap ratios right. This means that he is easier to balance because you can finetune the ratios until they are perfect. Now, the ult. If Ryzes ult was to be reworked, rather than the rest of his kit, i believe us ryze mains and the lareg majority of r/ryzemains would be happy. Im suggesting that instead of the current cersion of realm warp, it is changed to either a shorter dash, maybe with a radius of something like a kassadin ult. Only he can use the realm warp. This fits his lore much better as being a mage trying to save the world on his own. It would also still allow for montage plays with ult escapes to happen. The second option would be to make the ult a charge based system like kassadins ulti, but instead of a movement ability, make it a shield that also gives ms. Basically, the q passive becomes his ult. The ability also has the same passive as pbe ryze with his q damage scaling when it hits his spell flux. The biggest thing us ryze mains want is some survivability, and our resets. This way we can make flashy plays and have some skill expression in our champion.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading \r\nSincerely, a sad ryze main.","replies":[]}
