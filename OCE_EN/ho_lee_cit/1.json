After a minute or two I manage to get into the game with some time to pick my champ, though unable to pick anything and after 5-10sec it says I failed to pick a champ. This then will make it as if i &quot;dodged&quot; a game which also means more queue time for me.\n\n2: Attempting to reconnect multiple times in game\n\nThis is gamebreaking. Upon entering a game, I kept on getting this cycle of &quot;Attempting to reconnect&quot; which will only be fixed if I alt+f4 and reconnect manually. I have tried waiting for the system to reconnect me to the game but nothing really happens. At that time I can see what&#039;s happening in game but unable to move at all. While this is happening I usually have other stuff that are using my connection without any problem at all.\n\n3: Is it my internet?\n\nNo, I don&#039;t think so as I stated above other program are running fine while I&#039;m having this &quot;Attempting to reconnect&quot; issue in game.\n\n4: How does this affect me?\n\nGetting massive reports from players and flamed all the the time in game. Literally just wasting my time as I might be really damn close on getting this unranked account banned for something I&#039;m unable to control.\n\nTL;DR\n\nKeep on dcing in game when internet is fine. Please, how do I fix this? {{item:3070}} ","replies":[{"poster":"A Flying Brick","date":"2016-03-08T22:15:35.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, test any possible solutions in a custom game, you won't get tagged for leaving/dcing those.\n\nThese could help:\n\n- Check your firewall/anti-virus software settings, incase LoL is being blocked.\n- Disable Peer-to-peer (it's in the gear icon of the cilent)\n- Make sure Pando Media Booster isn't on your computer (it use it be part of LoL but got removed and since then has be hyjacked into adware/spamware)\n- Try a full re-install, it might help in this situation, since you think it's not your internet doing this.\n\nIf that doesn't work, try sending in a support ticket. Also your system specs would be super usefull.","replies":[]}]}
