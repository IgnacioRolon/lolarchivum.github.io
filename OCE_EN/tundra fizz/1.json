Just in case anybody is wondering what this is.**\n\n**Link to NA thread:** http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/3V6I7JvK\n\nWhat is FEK? Since you&#039;re familiar with what the boards look like without it, [here&#039;s what it will look like with FEK installed](http://i.imgur.com/cfLwfdB.jpg).\n\nIn short, it makes the boards appear a lot nicer by changing the formatting and allows people to have their own avatars. It also provides other new features as well. For a complete list of all features that exist, [see this post](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/eth0WWoE-forum-enhancer-kit-fek-40?comment=0000).\n\n---\n\nIn order to use FEK, you need to first install a Script Manager for your browser.\n\n* Google Chrome uses [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)\n* Firefox uses [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)\n* Opera uses [Violentmonkey](https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/violent-monkey/)\n* Safari uses [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)\n* Internet Explorer has no suitable script managers\n\nOnce you have a Script Manager, FEK can be downloaded.\n\n---\n\n**Latest FEK Release:** July 27, 2015\n[Click here to download the latest version of FEK!](http://videomatic3.diskstation.me/~tundrafizz/fek/FEK.user.js)\n\nOnce you have downloaded FEK, you will see it at the top of the page.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/p19iotx.jpg[/img]\n\n---\n\n**Avatars** - To receive a custom avatar, simply post the image you want in this thread.\n\n1. Your avatar must not be larger than 500 KB in size\n2. Your avatar must not be inappropriate, decided by the FEK mods\n3. Your avatar&#039;s format must be .gif .png .bmp .jpg/.jpeg or .webm\n4. Your avatar can be any dimension, though non-square avatars will stretch\n\n---\n\n**Donations**\n\nDeveloping FEK took an insane amount of time, and if you want to support the work I&#039;ve done, donating is always nice.\n\nThose that donate will receive a \"donor badge\" under their avatar for the length of time equal to one month per $1 USD donated. Currently this badge is something I need to add manually, so it may take up to 12 hours.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/AQPcc97.jpg[/img]\n\nFor more information, click on the \"Donate\" tab on the FEK Panel.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ygue0h6.png[/img]\n\n---\n\nAdditional Q & A can be [found in this post](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/eth0WWoE-forum-enhancer-kit-fek-40?comment=0001).\n\n---\n\nI will continue to work hard developing FEK, and thank you for using it!\n\n-Tundra Fizz","replies":[{"poster":"Tundra Fizz","date":"2015-07-28T03:06:15.759+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"**Q & A**\n\n---\n\nQ. Everything looks all messed up, what's wrong?\n\nA. The most likely problem is that you have either have an old version of FEK where things on the server-side have drastically changed, or you have FEK 3.0 installed as well.\n&nbsp;\n\nQ. How long will it take for my avatar to be uploaded?\n\nA. That depends on when a FEK Moderator or myself sees it. We can't be watching threads 24/7 and we have our daily activities just like you, so it might take a while.\n&nbsp;\n\nQ. Can't you have it so that we can upload our own avatars?\n\nA. Yes, and we've done that in the past. People have abused it though and uploaded inappropriate and/or NSFW images which is why it needs to be done manually now.\n&nbsp;\n\nQ. I found a bug, where should I report it?\n\nA. Preferably in the [NA FEK Thread](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/3V6I7JvK), though you can still post it in the OCE/EUW/EUNE threads. I'll just probably see it earlier if you post it in NA.\n&nbsp;\n\nQ. Can you make [insert feature here] possible?\n\nA. Depends. If I can get access to a component I need for a feature I'd like to develop, then yes. There's some things that would be impossible for me to do though since some information Riot hides so it's unavailable to me.\n&nbsp;\n\nQ. Why did you do decide to do all this?\n\nA. There are two things I love and one thing I hate. I love League of Legends, I love the forums/boards, and I hate how simple and ugly it is. Since I'm pretty knowledgeable in quite a few different things like JavaScript, PHP, and SQL, I was able to put all that to work into creating the Forum Enhancer Kit so that the people who get it will have a much better experience as they browse the boards.\n&nbsp;\n\nQ. What's your favorite champion and skin?\n\nA. Fizz and Tundra Fizz respectively.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tundra Fizz","date":"2015-07-28T03:05:31.178+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"**FEK Features**\n\nYou can customize FEK to your liking and turn off some features if you don't like them by [using the Control Panel](http://i.imgur.com/OaB7AxX.jpg).\n---\n\n**Avatars and Status Icons**\n\n[As seen in the first post](http://i.imgur.com/cfLwfdB.jpg), there are status indicators.
