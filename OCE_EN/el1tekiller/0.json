Oh and Eve too, I almost forgot there is a champ that goes by that name, I guess it's due to her perma stealth.\n\nBut yeah, champs wouldn't be removed outright, you're right, and there is nothing wrong with that either. But still, getting them stuck in an endless existential limbo for eternity until Rito god finally remembers them 1 day isn't the greatest approach either.\n\nhttp://www.nerdargufy.com/uploads/2/6/1/4/26144516/184783.jpg?369\n\nOh well.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-05-05T01:21:01.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\".

That's what I was meaning to come across.\n\nThat said, at least it seems to have vastly improved from where it was during the height of this, I mean Urgot is finally getting his long waited rework and it's just around the corner, so yeah that's cool and great indeed. And I hope it could get even better in the future.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2017-05-04T23:37:23.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no, they'll never remove champs.\nI think I read somewhere that their biggest regret was ever releasing vlad though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2017-05-03T12:53:40.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Riot ever actually takes that dark turn, I swear I will uninstall this game and refuse to ever play it again.","replies":[]}]}
