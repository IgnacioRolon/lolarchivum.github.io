He needed a little help.\n\nThe Ult change isn't that big of a deal. The shrooms also last 5 mins now instead of 10.\nThe bush thing will be interesting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-07-24T11:45:21.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not that big really. Quicker to stealth and stays stealthed in brush isn't that impactful. Bouncing shrooms would be useful, but they won't arm mid flight so they would take longer to arm overall, leading to more time to react and dodge. The range boost is pretty good so that sort of sucks. All in all, they are mechanical changes, and not buffs to his damage thank goodness.\n\nTo be honest, he sort of needs them since that besides an annoying early game he is really weak in the late game, getting destroyed instantly in team fights.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-07-24T09:08:54.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIto why you do this","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-24T08:16:12.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"God damn it Rito, NO.","replies":[]}]}
