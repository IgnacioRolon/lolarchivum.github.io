Not just some hot guy who could be a complete ass to you?\" She just shrugged and turned back to her friends. \n\nIt's shit, but some people are just so desperate to find love in high school they ignore the actual key features that will truly make them happy. It doesn't matter what your IQ is, in my opinion there is no 'smart' or 'dumb', people can be more knowledgeable about something else that others aren't, you may know a lot about League, while say your sibling or friend may not play, but it doesn't make them dumb. I'm not defending people who can be jerks, but they can still be smart in their own way about different things, just like you or me. \n\nMy advice is you just gotta keep your head up and move forward, focus on what's actually important. As nice as it is to have someone to love and to love you, you're not gonna get it if you look for it. You know when you lose something? And half the time when you look for it you can't find it, but when you don't one day it just turns up? Think of it like that. It's not just the guys, but the girls too, and don't worry, nice people don't finish last, we all feel like we're losing at some stage but it doesn't mean we're gonna lose forever, these guys may look like they're winning now, but it wont stay like that, things come in their own time, and you're not gonna finish last I can assure you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-05-20T14:01:57.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Girls already have a kitten, why do they need another one?\n\nAyy lmao.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lonely Flame","date":"2015-05-20T11:56:01.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, while it's good to seek advice on life, questions like these don't really belong on a forum about a video game. But I could understand if this is the place you feel most comfortable asking.\n\nSo, why do the nice guys finish last? Well having been there, done that, grown up and helped other people with similar issues, I can confidently say: they don't really.\n\nI could give you a long speech about this but I'll give you a few cliffnotes:\n\n* Never, EVER, call yourself 'the nice guy'. Yes there are idiots in high school and I could probably describe the kind of people you're referring to pretty well, but no matter how monkey-like they are, no matter how much they may bully others or yourself, DON'T DESCRIBE YOURSELF AS 'A NICE GUY'.\n\n* Just because you're a decent human being DOESN'T entitle you to certain things in life. You can be the smartest kid in school, you can be the most friendly and helpful, but that in no way means that life, girls, or anything else owes you anything for it. It sucks, but it's true. A real decent human being does things without expecting anything. It hard but people will eventually notice it without you mentioning it.\n\n* Don't think yourself above others. Thinking you're above others makes you just as arrogant as them. Everyone is good at something. My guess is the guys you're talking about are probably good at sports. Or knowledgeable about cars. Or something that you might see as that important, but that's what they're good at. And you need people like that in life. You need people who can do what you can't or don't want to do. It's just useless now because you're so young but the earlier you learn it the better.\n\n* You're in Year 8. Life is hard now. Life will get harder. I'm not going to lie. But it will get better if you make it better. And chances are that time will come out of high school. But for the next 4 years, you just have to unfortunately endure. Focus on what you enjoy and understand that some people will make fun of you for that, but chances are you probably thing their hobbies and interests are dumb.\n\nLook this is broad and not what you want to hear, but it's honest advice, and if you take it on board it can help a lot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-20T11:51:04.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also they havent been treated like they should have been so when a nice guy comes to them they think they are *weird or thirsty*","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-05-20T11:05:15.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because the girls who like jerky arseholes really ain't worth your time, or at least not yet, before they come into realisation that jerks are after all, just jerks (excluding hot blooded folks I am just talking about genuine bad boys here) that is.\n\n Spend your time enriching yourself in ways you see fit, that's where it matters the most imho.\n\nBecause romance is often hormones filled when young, and money filled when matured. So for me, I really just leave it all up to probabilities while I live my life in my way.

Just wait till you have a bunch of moneys as a result of caring about your education and buy a gf while barry the douche or w/e from 10 years ago works at Maccas for the rest of his life and can only get gangas with diseases.","replies":[]}]}
