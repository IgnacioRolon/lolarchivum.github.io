You don't have to support every game, but there will ALWAYS be games you'll be forced to support, so if you're going to have to support may as well know how to do it correctly.

I used to play support and get no cs and I still won.","replies":[{"poster":"Strat","date":"2015-02-19T10:08:59.237+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh I agree, I'm actually a HUGE proponent of playing support in low Elo. People in low and high Elo are under the misconception that you need to carry a game to win it (or to push the \"chances of winning\" above 50% by any decent margin). This is, in my opinion, completely false. \n\nIf you'd actually read the bottom of my comment,  you'll see that I said \"learn how to support.\" That said, even supports need to know how to CS. There will be times when you are alone in lane (e.g. defending your tower when your ADC goes back, or you've already warded and you have no opportunities to help someone in the mid game). Being able to CS correctly (with no damage items) can get you your next support item MINUTES earlier than you would have if you suck at CSing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-02-18T23:31:03.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Annoying Turtle,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=bZPg9kJA,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2015-02-18T23:26:28.474+0000)\n>\n> You don't need cs to win.

This is for when you are not playing support.\nJUnglers to an extent still wanna do this if they are soaking a lane where the person is gone.\nHowever, I am a support main and I still recognise the need to be able to CS properly. In addition, I want to CS as well as possible whenever the ADC is out of lane. Because, why should I not?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blackavar","date":"2015-02-19T04:58:46.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the csing advice","replies":[{"poster":"Annoying Turtle","date":"2015-02-19T23:13:54.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"all good man :)\n\nhappy i could help","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Annoying Turtle","date":"2015-02-18T23:23:59.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Buy a account on eBay, easiest way to get out of bronze.\n\nAnd most of the time the accounts that you buy will have tons of ip for you to change your name.\n\nMy other acc I bought was plat 3 when I got it, now it's silver 3 :)\n\nI could easily be challenger but I can't be bothered \n\nAll u have to do is duo, you call bot, you pick yasou, your friend picks malphite.
