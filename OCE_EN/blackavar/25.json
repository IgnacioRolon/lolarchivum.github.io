They're freelo in bronze if you know how to use them.\n\n**Don't play when you're in a bad mood.** Yes, this actually helps. Playing with the right mindset/mood can make a noticeable difference on the way you play, in some instances being the difference between a win and a loss.\n\n**Accept you're probably not as good as you think you are.** True getting bad teams can be a pain but you and your opponents are matched with people from the same pool. Given there's only 4 other people on your team and 5 people on the other team from that pool the other team has *more* chance to get trolls/AFKs/generally bad players, thus meaning you actually have the advantage in more games than you think. Fact is people tend to over-exaggerate their own abilities on occasion, this may be happening to you.\n\n**Objectives.** I don't know how you do on this but it's definitely worth mentioning. Most people in bronze think a good K/D/A is what wins games, but that's useless without objectives.\n\n**Map awareness and wards.** Even if your team only uses warding totems that's still an advantage, because chances are the other team is ignoring their trinkets/wards. All you need to do is place wards in strategic locations, you can use google or ask someone to find out the best locations, and keep some attention on your mini-map. Fact: bot lane can keep the river warded by 'tag teaming' their trinkets, I know this because I'll do it when I duo bot with my friends.\n\nPS: You don't need to offer free stuff to get some help, some people will help you without promise of a reward.","replies":[{"poster":"Blackavar","date":"2015-02-28T01:56:34.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'm mostly good in normals but in ranked i just always fail a lot. quinn is one of my mains and also i'm giving away my blizard account because i don't want it, i never play and i figured someone will have a much better use for it. thanks for the help anyway and what is tag teaming wards?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-02-28T02:10:50.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I say tag teaming wards I basically mean one person places a ward and, when that runs out, another replaces it. Since the Warding Totem wards last 60 seconds with a 120 cooldown at first it's just easier to do it that way.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
