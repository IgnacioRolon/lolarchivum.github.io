Then I either get a {{item:1036}} or {{item:1001}} to go with it. If I can't afford either I usually get a couple of {{item:2003}} and {{item:2004}} to keep spamming abilities and put pressure on the enemy ADC. \nIf I'm still winning lane and have enough cs for another BF then I get that, finishing it to {{item:3072}} AFTER I finish Infinity Edge. \nBy this time, either the enemy or my turret has been destroyed. I semi-roam to mid and stick to the bottom half of the map cs if my turret wasn't destroyed or try to take down mid tower if it was my turret being destroyed and that they aren't pushing. \n\nI really like taking {{item:3009}} by this time. With furor if we're winning, with homeguards if I'm losing. Doesn't really matter that much. \n\nMy next damage item would be {{item:3153}} for the passive synergy with my lightslinger. Usually people start getting tankier so I take this if they're stacking health. \nI finish my usual build into either {{item:3142}} and/or {{item:3071}}. \nGhostblade for a more splitpush playstyle. If I am taking a lot of damage and often get caught I take Black Cleaver. If I am safe I take Ghostblade for teamfights I can't forsake. Usually I end up buying Ghostblade either way so I run away faster, it gives more initial burst anyway. \nIf I have space I take {{item:3035}}.","replies":[{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-06-29T01:55:08.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"getting {{item:3277}}  might be better than boots of swiftness. About the {{item:3071}} though i think the cooldown reduction and health from it is extremely good but i don't think it will be a better item than last whisper because you need to stack the passive. Unless you start a teamfight with your ult to start stacking black cleaver and your team is heavy AD getting a ghostblade or Last whisper will always be the better choice because you don't need to stack last whisper and it is cheaper and has better synergy with your burst from your Q.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-06-29T08:27:20.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I know.\nI mentioned above that I only take Black Cleaver if I need the health. \nI know that LW is a better, easier item for maximum damage straight up. Additionally I take Ghostblade for its synergy with his ult. \n\nI take Swiftness so that I can chase people easier, kite them easier and everything. It lets me stay out of range can re-engage better than an Ionian and Bezerkers.","replies":[{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-06-29T09:49:51.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well with Ionian you will have a lot of mobility from your E dash and W give u movespeed .

Zilean support is also very rarely seen and pretty much non-existent. After getting Bloodthirster or infinity edge as first item you can either go last whisper straight away if your enemy started stacking armor. Getting youmuu's ghostbalde could be a good idea too because of the armor penetration although getting ghostblade instead of PD will make you more of an AD Caster which focus more on burst instead of consistent AA damage. Other than that the youmuu active works well with your ult too and that CDR from it means you can cast your skills more. For boots you can go either ionian boots of lucidity or berserker greaves.  As for last item you should get Guardian angel, Mecurial Scimitar or Banshee's veil depending on how much gold you have and which one is more useful to you. Banshee's Veil if the enemy have CC and you don't have enough gold for Mecurial Scimitar. Guardian angel if the enemy have burst damage. IMO building lucian as an AD caster will be best meaning you will focus more on your skills instead of Auto attacks because Lucian is a short range ADC with only a 500 AA range. If you have played graves before then just build lucian the same way you build graves. One last thing that i wanna say is i have never played Lucian before and im not a pro at builds but i do know what im talking about therefore it is your choice to trust what i say.","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-06-29T01:41:30.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't recommend getting sword of the occult, especially if you're not buying it til late in the game. Even at max stacks it's not really worth an item slot (110 AD +20% AS isnt that great compared to real items) and you will inevitably die in some teamfights so half the time it probably wont be stacked even if you're ahead.\n\nMaw is alright but banshees veil or mercurial scimitar are usually better choices for an mr item. Wits end isn't really worth considering imo.\n\nApart from that its fine, though delaying BT might often be better if you dont need the sustain","replies":[]}]}
