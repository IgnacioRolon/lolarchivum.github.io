Copious amounts of sweat slid down their faces as they approached a large temple in the middle of nowhere. Stopping in front of it, Ezreal pulled out a notepad to describe the details: Around eight metres tall, brownish-red, a large doorway that was left open. A large symbol reminiscent of the one in summoners rift that herald the coming of the fire dragon was embossed on the doorway. As an archaeologist it was his duty to recover old pieces of history from Runeterra.\n\t&lsquo;Can we go in?&rsquo; Asked Lux, who had chosen to accompany him. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t stand this heat at all. How can you ignore it so easily?&rsquo;\n\t&lsquo;I just get used to it I guess.&rsquo; Said Ezreal, putting his notepad in his bag. &lsquo;We can go in now, hopefully this will explain all these new dragons that have been showing up recently.&rsquo;\n\tThey stepped into the temple cautiously. The walls showed signs of scratch marks. A single torch flared defiantly in the dark, still glowing after centuries. Below the torch, stairs stretched down into oblivion.\n\t&lsquo;Ezreal, I&rsquo;m scared. Should we turn back?&rsquo; Lux said, her voice quivering slightly in fear.\n\t&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be scared. I&rsquo;ll protect you, a lot of people are depending on me to find out what&rsquo;s in here.&rsquo; Said Ezreal, taking several steps down the down the flight of stairs. Lux hesitated for a moment then rushed to follow Ezreal in his descent. Before long it was pitch black and the duo had to take every step slowly and cautiously.\n\tAnother torch shone in the darkness, indicating that they were at the bottom of the exceedingly long staircase. They stepped onto the landing and surveyed their new surroundings. Four coffins were by the side of them and a large wall blocked of any chance of continuing. The wall on the far end had several words inscribed that were lit up faintly by the torch.\n\t\t&lsquo;By these coffins lie forgotten brothers, buried in the mists of time.\n\t\tThe first brother was fair and just, smart and kind and was the \n\t\twealthiest of them all. He died by the hands of the youngest.\n\t\tThe second brother was an innovator, a scientist, an archaeologist.\n\t\tIt was purely devastating when at last he fell to the hands of the youngest.\n\t\tThe third brother was a leader in all rights, bringing many victories.\n\t\tHis own wine bought him death, poisoned by the youngest brother.\n\t\tThe fourth was a greedy murderer, willing to kill to make his own fortune.\n\t\tHe lived in his brothers&rsquo; wealth, never dying or being caught.'\n\t&lsquo;God, I don&rsquo;t like this fourth brother too much.&rsquo; Ezreal said, writing down the words inscribed into his notepad.\n\t&lsquo;Nor do I.&rsquo; Lux replied, then she screamed. By the coffin closest to the wall a single skeleton sat staring at them. A wealth of gold covered his lap. A crown embedded with blue sapphires sat on his head. The skeleton slowly got to his feet, the gold fell to the floor with an audible clang. Decaying skin hung off him in folds and one of his eyes hung of his skull by a single strand.\n\t&lsquo;Shades, what is that?&rsquo; Ezreal asked, hastily writing down everything he saw into his notepad. The skeleton slowly made its way to them. Lux ran behind Ezreal and gripped his arm.\n\t&lsquo;Ezreal, do you think this is the fourth brother?&rsquo; Lux asked. &lsquo;I mean, in the inscription it said he never died, what if he&rsquo;s still alive?&rsquo;\n\t&lsquo;I think you&rsquo;re right. But it is going to have to die, it&rsquo;s probably going to try and do us in like it did to those other brothers.&rsquo; Ezreal replied. He walked up and punched it with his gloved hand. The skeleton was knocked back to the ground and all the bones scattered.\n\t&lsquo;Wow, thanks Ezreal.&rsquo; Lux said happily, hugging Ezreal tightly. After finally letting go, Ezreal went to inspect the remains of the skeleton while Lux inspected the perimeter of the room.\n\t&lsquo;Ezreal, look. I found a lever.&rsquo; Said Lux excitedly, pointing just behind the place where the skeleton was previously. Sure enough a small steel lever stood there, rusting through how long it had been there. She walked over and pulled the lever. A loud grinding sound was followed by the far wall slowly lifting up. They walked through the doorway and were met with several hundreds of glowing bubbles. Most of them were black but over a hundred of them displayed small moving images. One of them showed Ezreal looking at the very same bubbles and not far off there was one showing Lux doing the same thing.\n\t&lsquo;What do you think they are?&rsquo; Asked Ezreal, surveying them. For once so lost in wonder he forgot to write it down in his notepad. Another bubble floated by, showing Jarvan IV poring over a map of Runeterra whilst talking raptly with other generals from Demacia. \n\t&lsquo;Ezreal, do you think they are showing what everyone is doing at this current moment?&rsquo; Said Lux in awe. &lsquo;What do you think the black ones are for?&rsquo; Another bubble floated by, showing Rengar leap out of a brush and killing a small rabbit instantly.\n\t&lsquo;Maybe the black bubbles show people who have not yet joined the League. Look at that one over there, it shows Taliyah and it is still grey.&rsquo; Said Ezreal, pointing at one of the bubbles close to the back, sure enough it was still in an area between black and colour. The greyscale Taliyah was surfing on a large rock near a tall cliff.\n\tLux walked over to one of the bubbles. &lsquo;What do you think this one is then, I&rsquo;ve never seen this person.&rsquo; In the bubble was a grave digger who had greenish skin and yellowish hair. Ezreal recalled seeing him once before, during a Summoner&rsquo;s Rift match so long ago.\n\t&lsquo;That&rsquo;s Yorick, I saw him once. I wonder why I never see him anymore.&rsquo; Said Ezreal before noticing another bubble. This one showed two separate images. One showed Ekko walking through the street of Piltover, nothing interesting happening at all. The other side showed him still trying to save his friend, Ajuna, from death all that time ago, and him still failing. Ezreal couldn&rsquo;t help but feel sad for him. Never giving up to save a friend.\n\t&lsquo;Ezreal, look over here. It&rsquo;s Aurelion Sol.&rsquo; Lux exclaimed. &lsquo;Look at all those stars.&rsquo; In the bubble Aurelion Sol drifted along lazily through Space. Stars were on either side of him and the beautiful sight of galaxies filled their eyes. \n\t&lsquo;Lux, thanks for coming with me.&rsquo; Ezreal said. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I should write this down, should I?&rsquo;\n\t&lsquo;No problem.&rsquo; Lux replied. &lsquo;And I don&rsquo;t think you should write all this down. We can&rsquo;t have all these people just looking into our daily lives. I already feel so much of a prude. We should leave here and just forget about this.&rsquo; \n\t&lsquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s.&rsquo; Ezreal agreed. And then they left with promises to never return.","replies":[{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T11:21:57.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't expect that turn of events, but you managed to break the forth-wall without sounding cheesy.
