With that said, I honestly doubt anything will come of it, there are a variety of reasons why it would be impractical or problematic for Riot and the game, which I went into a bit of detail about in the other thread (which you can find here https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/tW614lhe-normal-urf-times-and-exam-conflicts ).\n\nI'd highly recommend that anyone you know who is in the same situation pop onto the boards and share their thoughts and concerns about this. It may not change anything, but there's no harm in trying.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RatsMakeMeHappy","date":"2019-10-19T06:19:11.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Focus on your studies, not the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Blackavar","date":"2019-11-07T04:59:31.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RatsMakeMeHappy,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=dRunOfIE,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-10-19T06:19:11.202+0000)\n>\n> Focus on your studies, not the game.\n\nReal late reply, but that is kind of the point.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-10-18T19:07:22.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have no idea why they're doing it so close to season end.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-10-18T23:30:53.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's because URF is being brought back as part of the 10th anniversary celebrations, and those dates are what fits with the original release date for LoL.","replies":[]}]}]}
