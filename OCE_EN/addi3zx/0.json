But this is getting out of hand. I&#039;ve encountered BOTS in my games that literally ints during my promos, not ONCE but TWICE. What is even going on anymore? \r\n\r\nMy recent game had a garen that built armor against a SINGED, never got his ULT upgraded until 20 minutes into the game, and to top it off, every game this LVL30 account played - he feeds. What is riot actually doing to stop these unmanned accounts from being created? I would like to know as having bots in your promos isn&#039;t the best feeling to have.

I don't anymore because the toxic player base (racist remarks and homophobic slurs) go un-punished.  And bots have become prolific.  I play an occasional aram to kill 20 minutes and if I'm feeling really nice I'll play non-ranked.  I gave up on ranked due to toxicity.  Gave up on actually spending money buying skins and stuff for chars I like to play about the same time.","replies":[]}]}
