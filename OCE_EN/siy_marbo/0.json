Every attempt at opening it has resulted in the League of Legends logo hovering in the center of my screen for a couple seconds before disappearing. I&#039;ve tried everything I can think of:\r\n\r\n- Fresh Installs\r\n- Forced Repatch (both with HRT)\r\n- GPU driver reinstall\r\n- No firewall\r\n- Admin rights every time\r\n- Decent gaming PC with Windows 7, runs every other game just fine (Dota 2, for example, at 200ish fps).\r\n- Shit ton of restarts, PC also has minimal startup programs/services\r\n- No third party firewalls (all deleted)\r\n- Performed a &quot;clean boot&quot; (as instructed by Rioter), no result\r\n- Actually downloaded an entire version of League from a rioter for the 8.17 patch (to avoid the patcher), also didn&#039;t work.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I restart my PC in Safe Mode with Networking, and attempt to open the very same exe file, it opens fine and patches up to date. So the client works fine when in safe mode. I suspect there being something to do with a driver somewhere, seeing as I think I&#039;m missing something related to the .NET FRAMEWORK 4, and have had issues with network drivers before, but I don&#039;t understand why everything else is running fine then. Any suggestions would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m still in back-and-forths with Riot support but it&#039;s been around a month and I want to play pretty badly.","replies":[]}
