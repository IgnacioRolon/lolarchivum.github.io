Smite was always needed to be saved for the next buff and riot was believing that smite should be used the way you want to, not a compuslory use to make sure you had vision of your jungle or maybe to get that pink ward vision, that is why riot added in plants, to get vision, to get health and etc. The jungle buffs made jungling less of what the term clearing is meant to be.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-11-23T09:22:35.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2 things, one, noooooo moreeeee tf jungleeeee\ntwo, it made a lot of other clearing harder and also the fact that some of those that havent ever jg since the rework dont want to leash me red, krugs were good for the auto reliant tanks, such as SION, and TF, but you also had options with how you cleared, did you instantly rush red and delay until smite if you were lucky, do u go raptors while waiting for smite, then red for that large heal, i remember when i was really into riven for about a week or two, i tried her jg, was alright, lacked in gank power, but i went krugs because of smite buff, somehow killed the reds (SMITE HEAL), went raptors, then with only about 200 hp left from raptors i start wolves get to 4 and back, simplez","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
