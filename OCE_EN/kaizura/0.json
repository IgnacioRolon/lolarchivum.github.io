Her traps are easily spotted and are just stomped on. You could argue that you could just e on her side of the jungle, however what is the point, the chance to have her e anywhere near a potential ult victim is non-existent. So, rito... you should make her e untargetable and maybe reduce the duration and give her ult a movement speed steroid or attack damage steroid. \nthanks","replies":[{"poster":"Whamu","date":"2014-12-12T02:04:05.352+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its day 1, you probably don't know how to utilize her to her full potential.","replies":[{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2014-12-12T03:17:30.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, this is a pointless complaint. Reminds me of when Gnar was released and everyone complained about how he weak he was on the Forums.

You cannot expect to play her like a God on the first day she has come out. That would be like having a baby coming out of the womb and expecting it to know French, English and Spanish, play the violin and know quantum mechanics all whilst riding a unicycle and eating a popsicle.","replies":[]}]}
