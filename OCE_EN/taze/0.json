But if you can get past that I'm fine. Maturity wise, lets put it this way, I don't find trivial matters funny and I think about how to change the world on a daily basis. One bonus is that I've abandoned school (for personal reasons; depression and suicidal thoughts) and as such I'm now available 24/7.\n\nI suppose I'm droning on now, but my godlike champions are: Vayne, Riven, Katarina, Ashe, Twitch, Fiora and Irelia. \nI can feasibly play every other champion in the game bar Azir, Taliyah and Aurelion Sol, but to a lesser extent to aforementioned core listed as godlike.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeyondPlay","date":"2016-11-26T09:31:11.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"plication\nFirst & Last name: Kael Hulin\nIn game name: Beyondplay\nAge: 21\nRoles: jungle, mid, adc\nLocation: ACT\nCurrent Rank: Gold 5 but I feel like I should be around master rank if I tried\nCan you use Discord?: Yes\nAny previous competitive Experience in League of Legends: I play for the r5s team GGNG and am the main player and shot caller.
