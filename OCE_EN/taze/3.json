This is more for OOL teams, not really OCS + as there is a lot more involed like contracts etc... (But its a really good base of how everything works)\r\n\r\nThis is just a starting point to help you become a manager or be a better manager. Who wouldn&#039;t want to be Reggie? :O \r\n\r\nHope you enjoy! \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to ask! \r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Bardarella","date":"2017-05-03T11:07:59.307+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great work","replies":[]}]}
