This means you can sign up as a solo player or duo (with a friend) and get put on to a team. If you don&#039;t know many people in league of legends and want to play some competitive league its good way to get started!  \r\n\r\nIts great way each month to meet knew people and maybe win some rp! \r\n\r\nLSD","replies":[]}
