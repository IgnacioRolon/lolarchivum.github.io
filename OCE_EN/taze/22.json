I am an admin in Summoners Society which is a facebook group. We are going to be doing a lot of amazing things this year. Lots of online tournaments, live events, online community games and so much more! \r\n\r\nBut the best thing about our group is that we follow the Summoners Code and it&#039;s a place for everyone to be in. Though sometimes we gain some backlash for our non-toxic rules but we have gained a tonne of community support for creating a positive environment. If sound like your kind of community, please come say hi! \r\n\r\nWe have twitter, fb group, fb page, discord, Instagram and website with an events calendar. \r\n\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}
