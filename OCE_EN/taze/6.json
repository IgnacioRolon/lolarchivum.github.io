We are running fortnightly tournaments. We would like to keep running them, as its amazing to see the community grow! Also with OOL only a few months away it gives really good practice for new teams that just formed! \r\n\r\nOur next tournament is this weekend! :https://www.facebook.com/events/356074774724958/\r\n\r\nWe would like to keep the tournaments running every fortnight but we need to keep having 8 teams sign up regularly. Each tournament has riot prizing (1st-8th place all receive prizing)\r\n\r\nAll future events will be shared in the facebook group, so feel free to join. (If your facebook profile doesn&#039;t have much information on it, just shot a personal message to one of the admins and ask them to say yes to request!)\r\n \r\nAt this stage, we have no found a way to help players form teams without it becoming messy and too hard to manage. If anyone has any ideas please feel free to suggest away! We love to find a way to involve everyone. Though feel free to ask in the group or use the &#039;Looking for a team picture&#039; in the pinned post of the facebook group. \r\n\r\nThank you for reading, \r\n\r\nJinx out! \r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2016-11-01T21:01:12.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cool what you're doing here!
