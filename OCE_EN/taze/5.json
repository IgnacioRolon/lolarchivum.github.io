I was wondering what you guys want to have for the community? \r\n\r\nWhat makes you want to be a part of community? What doesn&#039;t?\r\n\r\nWhat kind of events do you like? \r\n\r\nDo you want more competition or do you want more fun things? \r\n\r\nDo you want them online? Live? \r\n\r\nWe are wanting to run more things year, but we want to make sure it whats the community wants.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-05-23T14:00:16.768+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Things that make me proud to be part of the league community, are things that make us as players **rally together**. For example the Freljiord event, where the community split into 3 clans to support their favourite Ice Queen. Or when we fight as a whole to achieve something, like the ocean week challenge. _(e.g. I feel a sense of camaraderie when I see another player with Lissandra's icon, because I know we both fought together on the same side once.)_\n\nNothing really makes me not want to be a part of the community, obviously toxicity and stupidity are unpleasant and certainly don't make me feel proud of us as a group. But apart from the occasional toxic idiot in denial, I feel nothing but pride when associating myself with the community!\n\nAs for my favourite events, I love themed events! wether they are offical riot ones, or fan competitions. Anything that brings out the essence of runeterra or its characters, or like i said above, ones that rally clusters of players together.\nTherefore I get way more hyped for The Ritual of Ascension, or the Hunt of the Blood Moon, than I do for a group of letters like MSI or LCS and all the other acronyms that stand for people we have nothing to do with, fighting it out in a competition few people in the majority of skill levels can relate to.\n\nPersonally I prefer fun events to competitions. \nIn the end of the day, league is just a game. In 20 years time, no one on earth is going to give a damn who won worlds in 2014. No competition online is going to mean much in comparison to real sporting history, hell, most players don't even know Faker's real name and he's their hero! So he definitely won't be a long lasting hero like Kobe Bryant or Muhammad Ali. \nSo i'd rather just have fun in the moment and look back in 20 years and think _\"I cant remember what about, but we had some good laughs!\"_ rather than _\"I came 164th in some competition.\"_\n\nIm from NZ so anything live is kinda out of the question. It'd have to be online for me :P Nothing happens here.\nBut in saying that, live events are probably much more fun for those who can be there.\n\nI hope that helps! :P \nbut I am aware that I'm not the 'standard' measurement for the community xD\n\ngood luck! :)","replies":[]}]}
