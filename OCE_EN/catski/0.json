I ignored the reaction videos and watched the trailer video on the League of Legends channel. When I saw Morgana I definitely thought it was an improvement from before but some parts of her didn't make sense.\n\n When Morgana's quick introduction passed and I was greeted with the new Kayle I was extremely, and when I say extremely I mean it...disappointed. \n\nWhat happened to Kayle? What happened to her armour? Why is it a skin-tight spandex suit? I actually kind of like the white and gold armour as it fits the Demacian theme but that's where what I like about it ends. Her armour doesn't look or feel like armour. It's an over decorative plating on her for some reason **purple ** spandex suit. Demacian armour is supposed to be bulky and big and ACTUALLY protect the wearer. I know she is also Targonian but she doesn't look Targonian either at ALL. \n\nI actually laughed when hearing her voice line saying something along the lines of \"This is why I wear armour\" WHAT ARMOUR? That 'armour' won't protect you from anything. It feels like whoever worked on her and designed her new look didn't have to go through any criticism at all. \n\nHer design is terrible and bland and doesn't fit with Kayle as a character. Isn't she supposed to be a strong, righteous, emotionless and mysterious character that is above all? If so then why doesn't she conceal herself and actually gain more armour? She just strips away and in turn, becomes MORE human...Old Kayle did the armour thing 100 times better. I really do hope that Riot makes changes to Kayle and makes her feel like Kayle and not some randomly sexy sleek angel warrior that you could find in any other game. rito pls\n**\nAlso if anyone is interested please watch TB Skyen's amazing video on the rework where he talks about both Kayle and Morgana. He makes great videos :)  \n**\n_**His video**_: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hor9qlDoyIY&amp;t=708s","replies":[{"poster":"ClickClack472","date":"2019-02-26T09:41:59.086+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because they really like sexualising every character ever","replies":[{"poster":"Montiness","date":"2019-03-05T21:23:25.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Morgana was sexier before.... same as MF.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Shadow","date":"2019-03-07T19:29:50.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Morgana was definitely not sexier before. She always had revealing clothing, but if you look at her poses and her animations, she was never very sexualized. She had a lot of power poses and projected a lot of strength. Now they basically gave Morgana the Evelynn treatment and she's some sort of teasing temptress. I honestly can't stand how they've changed these two characters so much.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wyntr","date":"2019-02-25T13:07:00.054+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What was the point of the Kayle rework? Looks like nothing will change. Quick skin sales maybe. She won't be picked in competitive, and probably only the same people will play her.\nEarly game looks weaker than ever but late game looks stronger than ever. Not viable for competitive.","replies":[{"poster":"Montiness","date":"2019-03-05T21:24:22.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it was more to make her a clone of a Heroes of the Storm champion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Montiness","date":"2019-03-05T21:22:17.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Morgana looks worse, although spell effects look nicer. Remember the thing about zoe looking out of place? Grats on making morg look out of place. It's honestly garbage.\nAlso - they have not updadted abilities and a range of splash art.\nif everything's not ready, don't launch it.\n\"smited\" isn't a word.... use smote or \"didn't smite\" instead. placing \"ed\" on the end of anything to make it past tense is what uneducated people do. other exampled include casted and dived (taken from the interactions vid)\n\nbut honestly... new morgana artwork is a complete waste of money. I'd prefer it spent on making the game work. Stop trying to make it look modern when you have no interest in making the engine modern. And honestly if you look at the state of UDYR, a champ that people don't even bother, and haven't bothered for a while to level his ult, doesn't that scream that the champion demands attention more than a visual downgrade?","replies":[]}]}
