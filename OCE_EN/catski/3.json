Today I tried playing the updated Morgana since the top laner took Kayle before me. I went mid and did well. I didn't feed, the malphite and I traded kills and I solo killed him a few times. Throughout the game I was quiet and only pinging to communicate but it was just so annoying...Why was my whole team playing like mentally challenged children? I just wanted to have some fun but that was impossible with the enemy team all so fed. Our Yasuo would constantly tp into the enemy team, the Lux would miss her ult by a mile every time and try to solo the fed Twitch. The worst part was seeing the Kayle flash ult into the enemy team doing baron and just die. All of this little stuff just every game i'm not playing Kat adds up and just makes me wonder \"Whats the point of playing if I can't play new champs without my team making the game absolute hell?\".  I know normals aren't important and it's nothing compared to the terrible players in OCE ranked but it still gets on my nerves.\r\n\r\nP.S Nothing will ever happen to stop people from being bad etc but I feel ranting helps so idk...","replies":[{"poster":"KDA Ichikaken","date":"2019-03-15T00:11:32.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Norms can also be coinflip.
