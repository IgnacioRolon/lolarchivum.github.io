BIG deal. There&#039;s no reason to complain or to be overly excited.

And that's great.\nShe's shy and curious and exotic, and the suggestively around her sexuality just adds to that air of mystery and curiosity. Filling her out more as a character.\n\nJust like Taric's supposed sexuality aids his character development. He's strong and muscly and _**extremely**_ camp, if he had 3 girls under his arm in his splash arts, it would just seem wrong and out of character.  Likewise with Evelynn. If Eve was all about girls and couldn't care less about men, the whole impact of her character as the seductress would be diminished.\nVi too, she suits being the tomboy 'lesbian', because that's how the image of her character was designed.\nObviously Xayah/Rakkan's orientation too is highly key to their character.\n\nThe only champ whose sexuality I have a problem with is Varus.\nYou don't just pick a champ and random and just twist and mangle their storyline beyond recognition until you manage to fit two gay men into their body.\n\nIt'd be fine if you wanted to make that story for a brand new character _(you could even have 3 seperate voice overs, it'd be awesome)_, but don't change characters that people already know and love the way they are.\n\nTo be clear, I have no problem with a character being gay or straight or whatever, I have a problem with them taking an existing character and changing it just cos.\n\nIt'd be no different than if they were suddenly like \"Oh yea btw, Yasuo is trans.\"\nAfter all these years and all the people who are invested in the character, we thought we better tell you now, turns out everything you knew about him was a lie.\n\nYasuo already has a set story, just like Varus did. \nYou don't fuck with the story.\n\nIf it doesn't aid the story, don't do it.\nNeeko fits the story. Thats good. People from all walks of life can appreciate that.\n\n_____________________________\n\n#Fictional characters and how they DO affect us.\n\nI have to disagree with the last part of your statement.\nFictional characters can highly affect us both individually and as a society. \n\nThink of a world without Batman or Superman, (or Pikachu). How different would that be _(for a start Marvel comics probably wouldn't even exist, or at least not be well known, and we damn well wouldn't have any Avengers movies)_.\n\nSuperman was actually used to support the war effort in WWII, he inspired soldiers and civilians alike to do their best for their country. \nHow instrumental has Wonder Woman been to inspiring young women?  How has her existence affected various feminist movements?\nThe UN actually officially named Wonder Woman an \"Honorary Ambassador for the Empowerment of Women and Girls\" _(before, ironically enough, the very people she empowered voted her be stripped of the title.)_.\n\nThe character Spock inspired real people to become scientists, and do work that benefited the world, and one day may actually get us to other planets following the character's footsteps.\n\nHow many people in the civilised world haven't seen or heard the word 'Pikachu'?\nWhat would the internet look like without our little yellow friend and everything he has inspired since his creation? Does the internet not affect us?\nWould modern Japan be the same? That little character deeply affects an entire country.\n\n> \"character who in no way effects you\" \n\nNo one knows how the world will adopt a character.\n\nJRR Tokien wrote a book about wizards and dwarves.\nHe never in his wildest dreams through that an entire country _(which had nothing to do with it at at the time)_ would adopt that story into their very essence of their nation. \n\nThis is one of the reasons you don't just add crap into a characters story for no reason.\nThey do affect us. And if the character is inaccurate or improperly represented because you 'just wanted' them to be X, then that decision affects us too\n\n**E.g.** If I were gay, I wouldn't want Varus being the poster-child for my community. What values would that bring?\nVarus' sexuality was clearly an afterthought!  Its not a stretch to assume someone caught a bit too much SJW flak and though _\"Shit, better appease these guys! We better make one of the champs gay real quick.\"_ \nIs that how you want the gay community to be viewed?  As an afterthought to be appeased? Thats what adding random shit into a character 'just cos' does.\nThey didn't even bother to change Varus' appearance or VO. Thats how little it meant to them.\n\nI would much rather be represented by someone like Neeko or Vi.  They're cool, they're interesting, yea they don't hide that their orientation, but it also doesn't define them. Their sexuality neither restricts, nor defines who they are. It's not something to be ashamed or proud of, it's just how they are, and what they are is a badass enemy-team-killing machine. They have always been this way, and didn't bow to the pressures of society like Varus did.\n\nThats the kind of character that is meaningful, and if they did catch the right eyes and bounce out into the world at large like Superman and Batman. I assume they'd have a far more beneficial impact than Varus.\n\n#TL;DR:\n\nThis turned into a long post xD, but the moral of the story is:\n1. Don't force fit things if they don't fit.\n2. Don't underestimate the importance of fictional characters.\n3. I like Neeko, she's pretty cool. _(still getting accustomed to the voice though.. opinion withheld for now)_","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-12-13T09:49:19.597+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"japanese or spanish Neeko sounds much better, if you disagree, fite me 1v1 aram.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-12-13T10:22:51.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't heard Spanish, but Japanese sounds awesome.\n\nIm still not at the level where I can make sense of a lot of it.\nBut from the little I do know, i'd assume that screwing up the grammar in Japanese the same way she does in english would still sound kinda normal and cute, instead of just being annoying xD","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-12-13T04:47:38.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interestingly enough, you're the first OCE player I've seen even *mention* this.\n\nTake a trip over to NA boards, however...","replies":[]},{"poster":"NanoGod","date":"2018-12-13T00:11:50.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"She needs a nerf she is way unbalanced.

It's preseason anyway, and she'll likely be tuned down a little in coming patches. \n\nImo I feel her power is too heavily focused on her ult (like what is this, the damage is ridiculous, it slows, stuns and has a very short channel time, most of which can be masked)  and her base damages are a bit too high (I play tanky bruiser neeko on my alt, and it's just as good, maybe better since her other AP ratios are bad but her base damage is high), but she also lacks damage in some areas, namely I feel her e and her w passive have their damage numbers the wrong way around, and lategame she is literally her ult cd and nothing else.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-12-13T01:33:25.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree her ult is real heavy on the damage but personally I haven't found it all that hard to dodge with the self immobilise.
