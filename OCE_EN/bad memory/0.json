Is it unreasonable for me to think that this is unfair? I assumed riot would want to try to get people to play their game and quite frankly this isn&#039;t helping the matter in the slightest. I feel like I&#039;m not the only one being neglected by Riot so if you are then please speak up!\r\n\r\nHave you guys had anything like this happen and do you agree with me that this isn&#039;t good enough?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-22T10:23:05.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mate, they usually take around a week to get back to me.\n\nConsider yourself very lucky.","replies":[]}]}
