Some players have really good games/streaks of games where they play really well. Some people also pretend to be smurfs after doing really well in games (idk why) and give the name of a random high elo account/ a friends account. \n\nThey don't just exist in low elo either. I'm plat 2 and get matched with players anywhere from plat 1- challenger in ranked. Most of my games have smurfs in them too. Just think of it as a learning opportunity, watch what they do. In the long run, the challenge will be better for you :D","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-12T13:01:14.829+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">a random high elo account\n\nThe funniest \"smurfs\" are the ones that send you a name of someone, who is in game and playing at the same time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-12T13:25:26.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you in theory, but in reality it's hard enough when you're covered in bronze or silver as it is. At least at you're level you have some idea of how to counter play and team work and builds which matters. Bronze don't and nor do they care. Anyway, at the end of the day, like you said it's hard to police and I'm sure Riot in their wisdom have thought about it or tried. So fair call and just do the best you can with what you got.","replies":[{"poster":"a dozen midgets","date":"2017-06-04T08:43:55.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ya its hard to jump into a game when you just wanna play and have fun but then you're getting your but kicked.

I don't see why accounts can't be linked and once a player reaches a certain elo on any account, it gets matched on any new accounts they make.
