Because reports aren&#039;t stopping people.\n\nRiot doesn't want these poor people named, yet they do NOTHING about their behavior.\n\nMaybe i'll start a youtube channel, called LoL trolls, where people can see these players for themselves.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-06-20T04:44:41.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think one of the problems with naming and shaming is that we all have different views on 'bad behaviour'.\n\nI for example am fairly tolerant, I brush most bad behaviour off as stupidity and try not to pay it much mind. So what I would consider _'name and shame worthy'_ would be when someone brutally rips into someone about their race or sexuality _(and means it)_ and causes them to leave the game in tears.\n\nWhere as someone else might consider \"GG EZ\" at the end of a game, to be name and shame worthy.\n\nSo when person B, gets offended by Summoner101 for saying \"GG EZ\" he goes straight to the boards and name and shames them by saying \n_\"Ban this retard making our games cancer!\"_\nPerson A, then sees this and thinks\n_\"Shit! I don't know what he did, but Summoner101 must be terrible! ill focus and report him if I ever see him\"_\nWhen actually all Summoner101 said was \"GG EZ\" in jest at the end of a game.\n\nSo Summoner101 now has hundreds of players headhunting him thinking he is the devil, just for offending one easily offended player, who just misinterpreted the comment anyway.\n\nSo in order to prevent situations like this, or similar ones, all name and shaming must be stopped.\n\nAnyway, why even want to name and shame?\nRiot has systems in place for dealing with bad behaviour, and they work.\nall naming and shaming is, is vengeance.","replies":[{"poster":"Existance","date":"2017-06-20T04:53:09.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Name and Shame might be a better punishment than 'what riot does'.

The police, or Riot in this case.)_\n\nRiot have hundreds of millions of dollars, they have teams and teams of researchers and analysts working on this.

Hundreds of thousands to be sure.\nso of hundreds of thousands of people, only a couple of hundred players have reported complaints.\nThats a damn good ratio!\n\nWhich means that the system works more than fine for hundreds of thousands of other players.\n\nNo one said the system is perfect, Riot themselves have said so, but it's the best we have, and it's constantly evolving with better technology and analytics.
