Focus on getting better and you will start climbing with like a 65% winrate really fast. Or grind it out till your league mmr adjusts and you start getting 20+ lp a win. peoples lp gains/losses get adjusted to stop instability in ladder ranks. In a month I went from b1 after being stuck bronze for 6 seasons to gold 4 90 lp. It took me about 250 games with a 60% winrate on my main and a 50%+ winrate on everything else. even games I played poorly in lane I was still able to win by helping my team out and focusing objectives, and trying my best to not let my laner snowball hard. Every 2 ranks I had to improve which was a lot easier when you vs better opponents because they punish you harder for your mistakes so it's easier to learn from them. also if you duo with someone decent at the same rank or on his low elo smurf you can easily get a 75% winrate in silver if you just focus on winning lane and macro + objectives. I got my friend from silver 3 75 lp to gold V in about 20 games playing on my b1 account we were vsing mainly mid silvers with a gold V or 2 http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=RayzarVelder our losses were either my first game of the day or against duos/smurfs trying to get to gold before season ended. When I was hardstuck bronze all I did was focus on my rank but as soon as I focused on improving I started climbing. tldr: 60% winrate you will climb or keep a 50% winrate and lp will adjust and you will start to climb again. a 4lp difference really isn't much out of 10 games with 60% winrate it's only a difference of like 16 lp over 10 matches. so you will be gaining 18 lp every 10 games. 30 games with a 60% winrate should get you to silver 2 then after that should only take about 15 games per division.","replies":[]}]}
