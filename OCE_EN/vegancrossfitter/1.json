Wondering if this could get a touch up. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-08-22T13:40:32.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His ults are garbage as well lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-19T09:19:25.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"interesting note on the bots, if you put an intermediate shen against a beginner shen with a mirror lane, the beginner shen will beat the intermediate shen for the first 10min or so before the intermediate shen starts to comeback. Or at least this is what happened all the previous times I set up a 9bot custom game to practice a new champion.","replies":[{"poster":"VeganCrossfitter","date":"2016-08-22T11:14:19.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now that is a weird interaction. haha","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-19T09:23:34.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also don't ever get cocky in a bot game if the bots have a malphite, alistair, oriana, and annie; especially if you have some squishy mid like azir, ahri, zed or yasou. If the malphite ults you, they will all ult you and you will get wombo'd by bots and it doesn't feel nice to know you got destroyed by a bot.","replies":[]}]}]}
