Clicking that report button might not do much but it reinforces the idea that \"I didn't do anything wrong, it's their fault we lost\" which is the wrong attitude. Rather than blame someone we need to think \"how could I have changed the outcome? what could I have done different/better to not end up in that situation?\".","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-03-12T09:11:22.689+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oooo well said.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"M2001ARYAN","date":"2016-03-12T08:33:36.413+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is not a good reason to report a player...

Basically if a person was being reported a lot for unskilled player matchmaking needed to get it's shit together.\n\nIn the end it was a wholly useless report. I think maybe there are better ways to vent or cool off, but I can see where OP is coming from.\n\nMy only suggestion is to remember it's not about winning or even necessarily doing well (though those things are important to have at least sometimes too :) ) but it's about having fun.
