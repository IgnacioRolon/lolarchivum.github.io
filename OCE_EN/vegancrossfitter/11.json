My suggestion, and how I have gotten through my rough patch of &#039;post game rage&#039; is to listen to piano, or take a break and chat to some of my mates, but thats just me and there are hundreds of different things you can do to get over your &#039;noob team&#039; or any other problem that has made you rage in league. Another thing, remember its just a video game, and in the end everything will even out. If you need someone to chat to, feel free to hit me up in game and ill add you, I&#039;m on quite a lot so you&#039;ll probably see a me a lot. Cheers guys, have a good day.\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}
