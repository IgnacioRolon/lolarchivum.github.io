However, I do have a decent knowledge of this game and (especially recently) have gotten fairly good in most of the roles. Now, my question. How does riot decide on what rank each player gets? I carried a few people who only won 2 promos (the games with me) or so and got b1-2, not the worst ranks ever. But I who admittedly only went 4-6 (positive kda in all bar 2 games, high team contribution in all) receive bronze three. In all of my lost games there was someone who fed hard( see my match history) and even in some of my won ones, i feel like i dont deserve the ranking, and would like to see a formula used to calculate ranks and see the fairness in it all. I know lots of people on here will see this and do the typical &#039;dont blame your team&#039; and yes sometimes it was me who messed up, but i shouldn&#039;t have to carry 3-4 members of my team each game. Thanks for reading my rant, hope none of you share my pain but i know that hope is in {{champion:67}}","replies":[{"poster":"SKT T1 Taehoon","date":"2016-01-25T20:15:54.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"DUDE BE GREAT FULL YOU GOT BRONZE 3 \n\nI won 8-2 promos with just over positive KDA'S and got bronze 5 \nso just be great full that you got bronze 3 mate some people won almost all their promo games and got bronze 5 so yeah just be great full that you got bronze 3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-01-24T11:29:03.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering you only won 4 games out of 10.
