Was wondering if anyone else picked up on this trend as well or not.\r\nand the whole submit a ticket process really hasn&#039;t been helpful for me, as even when the ranked que was disabled at that stage all i got was a typical copy paste answer which of course yielded no results other than the normal &#039;its probably your internet&#039; (it isn&#039;t).\r\nSo yeah, anyone else affected?","replies":[{"poster":"Archanjewl","date":"2016-03-21T16:14:11.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you shouldn't play when you have bad internet or know when it's likely gonna happen, and you seem to be doing pretty well in your matches. I've had this happened to me in the past where I kept disconnecting and lagging to be blamed for leaving or afk, which had stopped my enjoyment of playing league.
