It's one of my favourite features of Overwatch and stops you getting q'd with those teammates you really don't wish to be in a team with (trolls, afk's, or just generally someone you don't want to match with on your team) It would expire over time and you would have a max amount of people you could unmatch with.\r\nWould really help especially for late night games and such when player population is small","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2019-10-09T05:26:05.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"It would expire over time and you would have a max amount of people you could unmatch with.\"\n\nYou realize this makes the system not work right?\n\nI'd have to be allowed to avoid queues with staggering numbers in just a single day if i did this the way i wanted to.\n\nBecause a decent chunk of the community is god awful.\n\n\"Would really help especially for late night games and such when player population is small\"\n\nAlso that ends up being the opposite of what happens, eventually the late night system breaks down due to something like this and everyone just gets ludicrous queue times because no one can queue with anyone else.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-10-09T07:49:07.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I can’t speak for overwatch.\nBut I don’t think a system like this would work so well in league, especially in our server.\n\nSay a player is really toxic for a few games and every player in those games tags them as ‘Avoid’.  That’s a potential 27 lobbies in circulation that player would be unable to join.  I dread to think what that would do to their queue times.  It’d probably be very frustrating and cause them to be even more toxic in future games.\n\nAnd In rare cases, you could possibly even prevent a player from playing at all if enough people got in on the plan. _(Telling everyone in your friend’s list to ‘Avoid’ X player, as vengeance for feeding in your promo game)_\n\n_________________\n\nIt may also have a reverse effect, and create more games with toxicity.\nToxic players have less tolerance and will quickly add each other to their lists.  Which might well spread out the toxic segment of the community over a wider variety of games.\n\n_E.g. a game that might have 2 or 3 toxic people will be less likely to occur as the toxic players will eventually have all added each other.  So rather than 1 toxic game with 3 offenders.  You’ve now got 3 games with 1 offender each._\n\n**In other words; rather than 3 players dragging 2 innocents down.  You’ve got 3 players dragging 12 innocents down.**\n\nSo In a system like this, while you’ll be more likely to avoid specific toxic people you’ve added.  In actual fact you are probably more likely to match with a toxic person in general, because the system will naturally reach a point where it can’t put two toxic people together in the same game.","replies":[]}]}
