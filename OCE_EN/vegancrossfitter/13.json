By performing a clean boot and disabling my firewalls, the lolclient.exe crash has stopped occurring for me, I am using windows 10 and have an alienware alpha ui computer. Riot has many articles that you can use to help you perform these tasks and have even provided two easy videos for the tldr people among us. I hope this can help some of you who i know also suffered from this crash issue get back into the game you love, if not send riot a ticket and or message me in game and i can run you through the steps needed to get back playing again. i have attached two links which benefited me greatly.{{summoner:13}} https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#wq3  https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes#wq7","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-01-16T19:28:10.968+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You seem to have forgotten the links.\n\nFor information on patching issues and setting up your firewall you can check out the below help articles; https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues\n\nThere is also a patching issues megathread over on the NA Help & Support forum here;\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/EQAnLoba-new-having-issues-patching-61-click-here","replies":[{"poster":"VeganCrossfitter","date":"2016-01-16T20:43:27.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow my bad man, it was 5 am for me when I posted this.
