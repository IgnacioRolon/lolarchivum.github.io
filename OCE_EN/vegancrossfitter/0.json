Are boots as essential as they once were, or will we start seeing more and more builds like those redmercy recently suggested as his builds which do not include them at all?

Getting hit in the fact by nukes or fighters is't going to change with the game the way it is, you dont want to push unsafely early and you should be aware enough of your flanks to have sufficient time to get away safely. I find t1 boots to be more a nice extra, i got a spare 280-320g.... meh i guess ill get my boots now and head back. \n \nonly time i dont is if im within 100g of finishing any of my ghostblade stepping recipes, as.... with my champ picks, flash+boots is the only reason you'll get away, but then i got you for 5mins anyways and with the down time, i quickly farmed some boot cash anyways. \n\nI will say it's probably most important on Mid lane / Jg / ADC's purely as range vs range, boots can make the difference of a safe 1-2 hit without reply, jungle can never afford to be slow, middle may want tht slight extra speed to cast skill shots safely etc","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-05-08T13:47:03.635+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Boots are still very important, if your enemy isn't building boots and you do, well that makes all the difference.

This means kiting potential, chase potential,  escape potential and better repositioning which make a huge difference in the actual game. You also get to lane faster on top of the really cost effective stats you gain on each kind of boots.

Likely to never ever happen though ;-;\n\n\nIf you want, I can do more of these \"alternate travel options\" \n\nJust thinking of the twist they will make... Kinda makes me want to play again if they do put them in, they just sound fun. Honestly, wouldn't mind making more stats and \"twists\" would be happy to if you ask for them.

(That's plainly because 6% Current HP and 10% of Maximum HP is always gonna be relative to what you're aiming at.) Hence it would be more gold efficient when hitting a high HP target than a squishy.","replies":[{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-05-08T21:53:26.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"approved- imo without going into freaky maths mode, even a quick instant calculation thats ball parked, BORK is almost required for any fighter/adc, it is an item that is always relevant and helps your sustain and grants a slow and another 10% hit...\n\nSo many champs scale better with this as their first item, especially with its attractive build path with item changes over the last few patches.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-05-08T14:23:16.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just depends on your lane, how its pushed, being pushed, who you're vs, who you are, i dont find it compulsory to get boots early, i slip it in somewhere along my ghostblade build usually, but i dont really ever plan on when, just pick the right moment where i realize the extra movement will get me the kill, push me further and further up, also an early merc treads / zerker greaves etc can be the difference in damage, tenacity, cdr, mpen etc, even if not for the move speed, its still a handy item slot to fill, however since 6.9 i have had a number of games i hit full build by 30-35mins and i start swapping my boots and 1-2 items to counter the builds of the enemy.
