Which ya know, seems to me that im not actually shielded? i still have the shielded icon on for both my s1 in solo duo and my g4 in flex on, so is it a vfx bug, a coding error, or just riot things? i only lost 2 games at 0 lp before demoting (till then it was win 1 lose 1 for about 10 or so games) while my mate has been at 0 lp since before preseason started (hes my duo too) and is still g4 0lp","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-12-18T10:26:47.555+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Demotions/promotions have been hella dodgy with the removal of tier 5s. There's likely a conflict between the fact that you are shielded but also tier 4 and not 5. I'd recommend submitting a bug report (bottom right of the client) and a ticket to player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nThey won't be able to promote you back because messing with that stuff causes all sorts of backend problems, but it gives them another report to help nail down the issues. Unfortunately such is the nature of preseason, especially with such huge system changes going through.","replies":[{"poster":"VeganCrossfitter","date":"2018-12-18T22:11:44.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah they got back to me and apparently its a VFX bug where it lists me as being shielded, but I am not actually shielded since it only lasts for 3 games after promoting divisions, something they said they're working on.
