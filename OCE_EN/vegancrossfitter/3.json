This happens to all of us every now and then, we all have bad games. However, when you get a player in your team who deliberately sets out to make the game as un-enjoyable as they possibly can for you and your team, who feed, bad mouth and are just generally horrible people, it makes you want a clearer path to justice in a reporting sense. I played with someone like this just recently and it makes me feel sick for playing this game, that I must be as horrible and vile as some of the people matchmaking put you in with, and because YOU try to be a good summoner you don&#039;t lower yourself to their level, you try to mute and ignore, follow all the advice riot gives about dealing with trolls, watch youtube guides on it, but the trolling continues and it adds up for a terrible half hour of your life. When I come back from uni, I want to play a few games, have some fun and relax, not be verbally abused and trolled by people who enjoy ruining the days of others.\r\nLong story short, we need a tribunal. I&#039;m sure 90% of us lurking the boards would be happy to help with this as would many others, we don&#039;t want these people in our games.\r\nI am submitting a support ticket for this game, But I don&#039;t expect much, I fully expect this summoner to continue trolling for months to come, because that is how our current system works.\r\n\r\nTLDR Trolls suck man.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2016-05-26T12:57:24.987+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wanna be able to name and shame, but apparently pointing out the trolls to assist the community is wrong.

This is a game that you play to relax and have fun, and it's a horrible surprise to deal with this kind of people.\n\nI'm not sure about a tribunal, but riot should change something.\nMaybe something as simple as match \"reported players\" to play with other reported players. So they can only troll themselves (as that seems to be what they enjoy the most).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-05-24T13:55:55.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I wish we had a tribunal also. The problem with the current system is that it relies on a lot of reports, and sometimes players are too disgusted to bother to report, they just leave the game in a haste.\n\n[Here is ANOTHER EXAMPLE while randomly spectating.](http://i.imgur.com/Qtvls9s.jpg)\n\nAs stated in the picture, the whole game has been recorded. All of the other nine players in the game said they were reporting this player near the end. I will check back in a month's time to see if Riot's current system is being realistic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-05-24T12:01:24.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get that all the time and have gotten it so much I can even tell that type of player from how they act in team select, thus I can avoid even playing with them if I want.\n\nI would rather take the punishment from dodging a game than from playing with these assholes.","replies":[]}]}
