Why does it seem in so many of my games that one team has never played before while the other has mained that role for years, i get blamed for losing games because im the jungler who &#039;kill steals&#039;. When in reality, i did all the damage anyways. Just, look at this match report, feel my pain, and then whine about how i shouldnt blame my team as i know somebody will. warning graphic content may cause harm to some viewers eyes.","replies":[{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2016-01-27T06:06:41.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No idea what this thread has to do with matchmaking.\nEveryone on both teams are of similar MMR. Everyone on your team (except annie) have been playing ranked since S4 at least. \n\nIt just looks like your lanes were all having a hard time. Maybe they weren't familiar with the matchups, or weren't the best at playing safe.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-01-26T08:42:18.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its better to give the kills to your carry, try to not take the kills unless u have to.

And I try to leave kills, but my carries are always too low to secure them.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
