Since nearly all of my friends have already uninstalled league, I need some new people to add onto my friends list to game with! (rant over)\r\n\r\nSo if you are a relaxed player, doesn&#039;t matter if you are bronze 5 and have a 3 percent win rate, just if you wanna chill and have some genuinely fun games feel free to add me and we can organise to play some games sometime! hopefully will see you on the fields of justice, summoners.\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}
