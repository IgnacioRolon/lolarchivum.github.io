We however are looking for a mid-laner, we have ADC, support, JGL and top, we all like our roles and lanes currently we're just missing a good synergised mid-laner. We use skype to communicate most of the time and we're mostly here for a good time, if we manage to push rating that would be great and we may become serious but for now, we're all here for a good time, have a good laugh and play a few rounds. My IGN is McGaw so add me if you're interested in seeing if you're good with the team and we'll see where we go from there.\r\n\r\nLife is all about fun, if you're not having fun, what is the point??? \r\n\r\nILY <3","replies":[{"poster":"Jazz McGaw","date":"2014-12-04T08:14:19.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah guys, I think we're alright now.
