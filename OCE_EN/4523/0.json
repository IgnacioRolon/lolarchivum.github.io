Not saying that this is necessarily the case with 4523, but it is definitely something which is going on generally - NA boards are also full of this sort of query.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-12-02T01:53:00.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"similar thing happened to me.\n\nThey dont care.","replies":[{"poster":"4523","date":"2017-12-02T02:01:42.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If i could just understand where the ban came from.. was me asking for them to be reported for saying \"g o o k\" it ?","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-12-02T08:20:05.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=4523,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=WUXWz7Y7,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-12-02T02:01:42.219+0000)\n>\n> If i could just understand where the ban came from.. was me asking for them to be reported for saying &quot;g o o k&quot; it ?\n\nSystem triggered for me when I queried whether a person on the other team meant to say g o o k or whether it was a mistype (they said \"g o o k work\").\n\nTold riot.
