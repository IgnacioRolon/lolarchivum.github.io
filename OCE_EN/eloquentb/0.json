This makes it exceedingly difficult to win games, and I feel that repeated attempts to report have not gone anywhere.\r\n\r\nAny communication about this would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-10-29T14:49:32.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Given the ease of making a new account, getting a dynamic IP and creating an email account these levelling bots are very difficult to counter.\n\nThey aren't ignored so much as the vast quantity of them makes them difficult to stop. Botted accounts are banned in waves, same way 3rd party bans are done, but catching them all is pretty much impossible. The best thing you can do when you see them is to report them as you have been, unfortunately it isn't an easily solved issue.\n\nThe only advice I can give is to try to get some other people who enjoy playing co-op vs AI together so you you can guarantee at least a few real players.","replies":[]}]}
