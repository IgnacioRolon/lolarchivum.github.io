In effect, &quot;only faker can play ryze like that.&quot; \r\n\r\nNot true. Ryze is easy mode, but only if youve had a few games with him.\r\n\r\nNotice how faker throws q at air? He&#039;s stacking both his tear and his passive. Not sure about faker but i prefer being at 3 passive stacks when going in for a fight because:\r\n\r\n(3 stacks) q (4 stacks) r (5 stacks) w q e q w q e q w q e q Etc.\r\n\r\nGuys, it&#039;s broken as all hell. Go out and exploit it. He is weak against cc, but 1v1, you cant move. It is true snare lock without gaps until youre dead.\r\n\r\nFrom your friendly LOL-God,\r\n\r\nNononotorious.\r\n\r\nSo ashamed that i have to play on this server. Anyone get the feeling we&#039;re rockbottom?","replies":[{"poster":"Candy Kayn","date":"2015-11-02T09:42:19.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a person who has played on OCE, NA and EUW/EUNE \n\nOur med/high Bronze and Silver are of a much lower quality of player then the other regions, at B5 and Gold-Diamond we are almost identically bad/good respectively.

If he really was easymode, just play him to challenger? Why doesn't every pro team have Ryze as a contested pick?
