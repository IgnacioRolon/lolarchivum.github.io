I mean I understand the need to move forward with the presentation of the game but what purpose does it actually serve when it just opens the client anyway? If anything I find it takes longer to now load the login screen than what it did when it would just load straight to the client which is rather annoying. Also, I know they obviously would have had to update the patch updater to suit the new login screen but honestly it looks utter garbage, like a blank colouring book to be honest. Please revert or at least give us the option from the client to not have it","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-08-27T07:38:27.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a feeling that it's a placeholder. There were talks of LoL making more games and their own client similar to Blizzard, uPlay, etc.","replies":[]}]}
