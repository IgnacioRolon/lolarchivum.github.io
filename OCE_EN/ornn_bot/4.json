I imagine they've just skimmed the first couple sentences or something and didn't actually think there was more to it than \"reporting a toxic player\".\n\nSomething you could try is submitting another response in that ticket, leading with something along the lines of \"I have reason to believe I've been falsely punished\" in order to grab the support agents attention to your main issue and, hopefully, they'll read through the issue properly (you'll probably get a different agent anyway, I'd imagine). Also, if you could provide screenshots of the full ticket, including that top part that seems to be cut off, (censoring any summoner names, to comply with board rules) that might give some (potentially helpful) context.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-06-08T08:58:10.653+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my experience tickets like this (\"I have a general question\" tickets) will usually be answered by a different agent if you just respond to the ticket even if you don't make a new one, I imagine that is true moreso if you express dissatisfaction with the response they gave you so that's probably the best course of action.\n\nHaving the whole ticket would certainly be helpful but I'll pass this on at any rate :/","replies":[]}]}]}
