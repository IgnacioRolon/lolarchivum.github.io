I realize that all the skins that I have bought were a waste but I have to change servers due to internet connections and playing with people in my area (as they use a different server).\r\n\r\nMy question; Will I get a free premium Hextech Chest when I unlock on my new account? Remember when Hextech launched and a free chest was given to everyone? Will I also get that opportunity? \r\n\r\nAs I side question, is there any way of transferring all my NA Server skins to another server for free?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-05-25T09:02:52.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nI believe you receive a starter hextech chest when you hit level 3(?).\n\n>As I side question, is there any way of transferring all my NA Server skins to another server for free?\n\nNegative, free transfers to OCE were only offered for players who were living in OCE and playing on NA before OCE was released, paying for a transfer is definitely worth it though depending on the value of your account.","replies":[{"poster":"Wulfinite","date":"2016-05-25T10:31:15.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the answer.
