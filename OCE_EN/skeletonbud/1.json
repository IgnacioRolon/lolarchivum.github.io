The vibrant, pink blankets crumpled against her weight. She slowly exhaled and inhaled, taking a breath of air every few seconds. She thought to herself, &ldquo;What would Karma think of me now?&rdquo;, the fox, clearly frustrated, turned so her head was muffled in her bed and her tails were sprawled in the air.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Squeak, Squeak!&rdquo;, Kiko loudly &lsquo;squeaked&rsquo; in her ears. It was clear that whatever Kiko said was not to be said out loud. Sighing and propping her hands under her face, Ahri turned towards the small-fox that laid on one of her teddy bears. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Kiko! Such language! Anyways, you can&rsquo;t blame me for looking so beautiful. What would the others think of me if I wasn&rsquo;t so self-entitled? Obviously not the best&hellip;&rdquo; , Ahri began to ramble to herself about how absolutely perfect she was, not that Kiko can&rsquo;t agree. Ahri turned her head towards her bedside table, her tails now laying beside her, she sat up and slid her body so she was an approximate of at least 2 teemo&rsquo;s away. Sliding her hand towards the table, she picked up one of the damaged star guardian shards. Yellow. Karma&rsquo;s Shard. It sat in the middle of her hand. Her ears drooped and her body slumped at the thoughts that continued to corrupt her mind. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;No! None of that!&rdquo;, Ahri thought. Kiko stared at Ahri in silence, not knowing what to do with the situation. Ahri remembers when she and Fortune first became a star guardian. The girls were clueless about our purpose, what they were meant to be doing. For training the team was split up, Fortune decided to work with Urgot and Taric as they had an affinity for Gunwork and teamwork, while she&hellip;she did not have anyone that could possibly work with&hellip;that is until Karma arrived.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Stand Ahri. You mustn&rsquo;t lower yourself, but rather you should conquer one&rsquo;s self to conquer all&rdquo;, Karma valiantly said. Her voice had no hesitation and her form was perfect. The way that her yellow and white uniform curved and flourished around her body astounded Ahri. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Uh&hellip;sure, Karma&hellip;? What are we doing today? Manicures or charming monsters?&rdquo; Ahri said with an unsure voice. She was hesitant, but who wouldn&rsquo;t when a Year 5 stood before them. Karma smirked and giggled.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;We are meditating&rdquo;, Karma replied. Ahri&rsquo;s brow lifted in confusion, her tails swayed at her sides.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Meditation? Why&hellip;? I mean not to be mean, but I have rather important things to do&rdquo; Ahri said and turned her body, swayed her hips, flicked her hair and walked away, her heels still apparent to Karma&rsquo;s ears. Karma did not mind, but rather she smiled, Ahri will understand in due time. \r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\nThe next day, Ahri and Fortune got together at some playground and talked about what their duties were for their training.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;We shot down some monsters that were terrorising and corrupting some Lordles down south, you?&rdquo; Fortune happily exclaimed, her body shaking with excitement for when their training should continue. Ahri rolled her eyes and sighed loudly. She turned her head to the swings where Boki and Baki were playing with Kiko.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Ok Sis&hellip;get this&hellip;Karma, the leader of the team, wanted to meditate! That&rsquo;s like so decades ago!&rdquo; Ahri huffed. Laughs were heard from one side of her face.  &ldquo;How could she not laugh at this&rdquo; , Ahri thought. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Sorry! Sorry, it&rsquo;s just the thought of you, the preposterous and perfect fox, meditating&hellip;PFFTT HAHAHA LOL&rdquo; Fortune exclaimed loudly as her voice echoed in the neighborhood, confusing heads turned towards them. Ahri coughed and hit Fortune in the head. Fortune quietened, but snickers could still be heard.  The two of them sat in silence, well one of them is silent. Their mediums non-existent to the people who were still confused about the situation in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yknow, you should probably follow her rules, I mean she is the leader of the team, both Urgot and GP clearly respect her well, I might be reckless but I&rsquo;m not stupid, she&rsquo;s probably teaching you something that clearly helps you somewhere you need most&rdquo; Fortune&rsquo;s voice was serious, her usual laid back voice now serious like she was preparing for a fight. Ahri&rsquo;s eyes widened in surprise. She hadn&rsquo;t seen her like this in a long time.\r\n&ldquo;Fine&rdquo;, Ahri quietly replied and stood from the bench they sat on. Kiko magically appeared and cuddled her shoulder. Fortune on the other hand, continued to sit on the bench, waiting for perhaps a danger should appear.\r\n~\r\nAhri ventured forwards in the temple where Karma meditated, only to find it empty. SCREECH!!! A blaring noise rang out from the city of Valoran. Quickly, Ahri ran towards the city, switching into her uniforms to maximize her damage output.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Team! Together now!&rdquo; Karma&rsquo;s voice confidently sliced through the destruction that was happening around her. Ahri turned her body and ran towards the rest of the group, which was covered by a shield of white and yellow iridescence. Ahri looked at the creature that stood upon her team. A Baroness, a monster of immense power, even stronger than the usual Barons. It was black with colours of a vibrant colour of green lodged within parts of its body excluding the mouth which was coloured with a dark colour of maroon. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Star formation! Get outside of its range and pelt it down with abilities! As soon as it is weakened, form together and take it out as a team!&rdquo; Karma&rsquo;s voice interrupted Ahri&rsquo;s thought process. Her eyes gleamed over to where she wanted to go, but her body did not move, nor did she have the ability to speak. Karma glazed over Ahri and widened her eyes. Quickly she moved towards her location.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Lath Rian Oune Vi! Defiance!&rdquo;, A burst of wind surrounded the team, enveloping the team with a white and yellow shield. The Baroness started to spray the team with poison, trying to break their defences.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Ahri! Remember! Heart and mind as one!&rdquo; Karma yelled at Ahri, her voice now breaking before Ahri&rsquo;s face. Ahri couldn&rsquo;t believe it, someone as confident as Karma, breaking in front of her, but because of her? Karma sighed and ran into the fight. Ahri stood still silent, Kiko pushed on Ahri&rsquo;s shoulder trying to get her moving, but she didn&rsquo;t. Ahri can&rsquo;t attack that, she&rsquo;ll ruin her uniform alongside to her perfect make-up and manicure&hellip;that was when it came to her. Karma stood and fought as a team, she did not, without a team, this would be impossible. How could she forget! It was the most important rule of a Star Guardian. Clink. Ahri&rsquo;s eyes tore from the monster and aimed her eyes at the star band that laid on the floor. She looked at the team in front of her and her soul quivered at the sight. While she stood perfectly, the others were on their knees, out of breath. She looked back at the Star band that held Karma&rsquo;s Shard. Quickly, she ran into the fight without acknowledging the already flying tentacle coming at her.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Urgot! Taric! V-form!&rdquo; Karma&rsquo;s voice clawed at her soul, as her 3 members stood in front of the tentacle, protecting Ahri. Her eyes widened as Urgot and Taric&rsquo;s body slowly disappeared, turning into little stars. Her body turned behind her as she gaped at the dying teammate behind her.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Never fear change&hellip;&rdquo; Karma&rsquo;s voice faltered as her entire body slowly turned into stars, leaving only  shards of Yellow, green and blue around her. Fortune growled loudly and started shooting at the monster in a crazed manner, though Ahri&rsquo;s anger is far more incredible.\r\n&ldquo;Kiko! Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; Ahri whispered, Kiko jumped into her hands and squeaked loudly.\r\n&ldquo;SPIRIT DASH&rdquo;\r\n~\r\nKnock Knock!\r\nAhri&rsquo;s eyes opened and glanced at her door, to find one of her teammates standing at the door.\r\n&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Soraka? Dinner finally done?&rdquo; Ahri questioned, Soraka nodded and walked away. Standing from her bed, Ahri walked to her bedside table and put down the yellow shard beside to the other shards. As much as she could forget, she&rsquo;ll never forget that day&hellip;Afterall, she&rsquo;ll do whatever she can to protect her &lsquo;family&rsquo;.","replies":[]}
