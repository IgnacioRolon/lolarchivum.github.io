Throughout her childlike days, she wasn&#039;t very accepted in the young people groups as they said &quot;Don&#039;t you have other things to do?&quot; or &quot;Pretty sure someone as popular as you should be doing important things than playing with us!&quot;. Because of this she was always playing by herself or with her brother, Garen Crownguard.\r\n\r\nOne day, unlike the other days where she would be by herself, she had noticed something...something different. Usually on a sunny and warm day most children would be out and about, playing with anything they could get a hold of, however there was no one, Luxanna thought to herself &quot;Huh maybe they&#039;re still sleeping, like me most of the time...&quot; *Snap, she turned around to see her brother running towards her &quot;Lux, we have to move&quot; Garen panted and talked in between puffs &quot;Why? are the other people playing Hide &#039;n&#039; seek?&quot; Luxanna giggled to herself, Garen sighed, took her by the hands and dragged her towards the Kingdom of DemaciStar &quot;Gaaaarreeeennnn! I want to play!&quot; Luxanna groaned, Garen undisturbed continued to drag her towards the building.\r\n\r\n(Kingdom of DemaciStar)\r\n&quot;We have to make an advance! We cannot allow them to the kingdom!&quot; Jarvan Lightshield the third commanded &quot;We must destroy them at once!&quot; He yelled once more, &quot;But sire we must be careful, if we aren&#039;t it&#039;ll worry the people of DemaciStar&quot; Blomgrun decided, Jarvan III huffed and held his head.\r\n*Bang! &quot;We have arrived sire, sorry for the wait Luxanna here has been quite the troublemaker&quot; Garen exclaimed, Luxanna on the other hand rubbed the back of her neck uncomfortably &quot;Hehe...sorry&quot; Luxanna looked down towards her shoes as though they were the one important now&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Blah blah blah, Bleh bleh blagh&quot; Luxanna groaned at the talk, she never really understood why these talks were so important, was it so bad that she couldn&#039;t play outside anymore, she sighed in defeat as she knew that she isn&#039;t going anywhere for the time being.\r\n\r\nAt least 1-2 hours later (Poor Luxanna)\r\n\r\n&quot;That will be all for today, we will continue this tomorrow!&quot; J4 yelled loudly, many of the people nodded or agreed, though luxanna not really... she wanted to be out of there, she was bored out of her mind &quot;Finally! its ending~&quot; She thought, soon enough people that had been in the meeting flowed out of the building soon following after them a fidgeting and giggling Lux and a soldier-like wannabe Garen. The two continued to walk towards the place where they were accustomed to stay at, silence filled in the gaps whenever Lux didnt have anything to say her brother until something popped into her mind &quot;Garen?&quot;\r\nLux asked to gain his attention, &quot;Yes, Lux&quot; he replied &quot;What was all that about, i didn&#039;t listen...&quot; Lux honestly said back fidgeting with her hands nervously, Garen&#039;s breathing fastened &quot;It was... y&#039;know...&quot; He sighed &quot;There are some baddies coming here and we need some people to become gooddies and fight them back, like that anime you like to watch Puella Magi modoka magica&quot; He thoroughly explained in the nicest and cleanest way possible, not wanting to frighten her, Luxanna gasped &quot;Woooow, I want to become a powerful girl! Can I? Can I? Pleaseeeeeee!&quot; she gripped Garen&#039;s arm intensely...&quot;i regret saying that anime...&quot; Garen thought.\r\n\r\nTomorrow...\r\n\r\n&quot;Lux, wake up we are going to be late again!&quot; Garen yelled and shook lux once more &quot;Nooooooooo...Bed too sooooofffttt!&quot; she groaned and moaned at the same time. *Boom!, Luxanna and garen jumped &quot;Garen, what&#039;s that?&quot; Luxanna screamed &quot;Lux, calm down, i&#039;ll go check you stay here okay?&quot; Garen began to turn but lux caught on his shirt &quot;Lux, i have to go, if you don&#039;t, i won&#039;t be able to protect you!&quot; Garen whisper-yelled &quot;No! i won&#039;t let you! what it you get hurt!&quot; Garen&#039;s eye widened, and sighed, &quot;Alright, Fine lux put your clothes on...hurry!&quot;. Young Luxanna quickly put her clothes on and grabbed her favorite stick &quot;Why grab that?&quot; Garen asked &quot;It&#039;s important...&quot; Garen forcefully sighed and held onto Luxanna&#039;s hands, before running towards the exit of luxanna&#039;s bedroom.\r\n\r\nThe War on DemaciStar and Stardow isles\r\n\r\nBoth Luxanna and Garen ran as fast as they could, knowing a stop or a break could cost their life. Both of them knew they had to get to better and safer ground, until something had blocked the path of safety, It was a strange creature one hand it held a scythe the other held some what of a portal to who knows where, the creature itself was dark and terrifying, teeth sharper than the sea creatures at Bilgewater, no eyes (or from what Luxanna could see) No skin it was a black abyss to Luxanna however that didn&#039;t stop Garen charging in &quot;CHARGE!&quot; Garen screamed at the top of his lungs &quot;Garen No!&quot; Luxanna yelled and with one quick swipe from the terrifying monster Garen fell to his knees, blood staining the floor, Luxanna looked up, he then started walking towards Garen, Luxanna felt numb, she couldn&#039;t move, she had completely gone frozen, her heartbeat going faster then she could ever imagined, then from the corner of her eyes she spotted an arrow, it looked silver and shiny in the suns rays, before luxanna could blink the small arrow had already penetrated the monster&#039;s body &quot;This world shall be mine, I will absorb such immense power&quot; the terrifying monster said, lux turned around to find a girl possibly her age standing behind her, she wielded a crossbow and many equipment, it looked like she was ready for things like this to happen suddenly lux remembered &quot;You...you&#039;re Shauna right? or Vayne&quot; She quietly asked instead of an answer she nodded her head &quot;Enough of this incompetence, I will destroy those who get in my way!&quot; Before luxanna could realize she was being targeted a hook was strangled around her &quot;Aaaaugghh&quot; Lux garbled, Vayne &#039;tched&#039; and tumbled forwards shooting another few silver arrows, the monster screamed loudly and soon the hook was released.\r\n\r\nLuxanna gasped for air, she knew she had to fight, she knew if she didn&#039;t everyone would...soon enough Luxanna stood tall and yelled &quot;No, I will not allow you to take what&#039;s important to me!&quot; She soon began to charge, gathering energy, the terrifying monster stopped his actions and move to look at luxanna&#039;s actions &quot;YOU THINK THAT&#039;LL STOP ME!&quot; he began to charge towards the young girl, vayne didn&#039;t allow it going for another tumble then condemning them to the wall hopefully stunning the creature, Luxanna opened her eyes and screamed with all of her might &quot;DEMACISTAR&quot; and the power emerged from her staff or stick covering the building in stars and light it, it burned to look at it, the creature on the other hand was engulfed by such amount of power that it felt itself being pulled apart &quot;No no no no no no! I will come back...!&quot; the creature yelled in agony, with the ending of the beam it was as if the monster had ever existed.\r\n\r\nL..ux...L.ux...Lux...LUX...LUX\r\n\r\n&quot;What, i didn&#039;t eat the cake&quot; she sleepily replied to someone &quot;You&#039;re going afk&quot; Garen replied &quot;Oh sorry hehe...&quot; \r\n\r\n&quot;Soon...Soon...We Dark stars shall rise!&quot;\r\n\r\nThe end.","replies":[]}
