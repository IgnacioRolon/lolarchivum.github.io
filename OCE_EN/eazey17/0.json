His first ban lasted for 2 weeks and it was because he was flaming his team for no help because he got beat by a Soraka building full ad in the bottom lane. But anyway here are the chat logs typed out because I can't post images.\n\nPermanently Banned\nEazey17\nBecause a player-triggered review found in your in-game comms extremely inflammatory and offensive, your account's been permanently suspended.\n\nYou are among 0.006% of Leagues players negative enough to be permanently banned.\n\nOther players judged your comms to be far below the standards of the League community. The vast majority of players agree that while League's an intense, competitive game, everyone deserves respect on the Rift.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYOUR CHAT LOGS\nGame 1\nEazey17: I fucking will\nEazey17: kys\nEazey17: fucking kys\nEazey17: stop being toxic u little %%%%\nEazey17: your cancer %%%%\nEazey17: fuck off my kills\nEazey17: kys\nEazey17: your a %%%% WE ALL REPROTING U SO GET READY TO KYS\n\nthen it continues but he still believes till this day that it was all the Jax's and his friends fault for receiving a ban. He needs to understand that it is his own fault and stop blaming everyone for the problems that he makes for himself. If someone can supply me with a way to upload an image I will post a screenshot of the chat logs.\n\nEdit: http://imgur.com/a/Ca7e1  I uploaded it to imgur.","replies":[]}]}
