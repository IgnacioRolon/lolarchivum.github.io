Learn and play late game scaling champions like Nasus/Jax/Sion/Malphite/Vlad/Xerath/Orianna/Ryze/Cassiopedia \r\n2. Ask yourself why you died\r\n3. Take into consideration the enemies items, cs, and powerspikes.  let&#039;s say the top lane maokai has died to you and he comes back to lane with a 200 mana item, boots, 4 potions, what does that tell us? He is going to fight us well over a longer duration, but he is susceptible to being 100-0ed...  another scenario (if the enemy lee sin is 30 cs ahead + 2 kills, and it&#039;s only the 8 min mark, he is against a Rammus and has itemized correctly, brutalizer, pickaxe, longsword, etc. you may conclude that within 1-2 rotations the enemy rammus will be dead) \r\n\r\n4. understanding the importance of cs, can&#039;t stress this enough, your #1 goal should be to get every possible cs (don&#039;t get cs if it means the enemy chunks you then kills you, etc) \r\n\r\n5. understanding the importance of wave positioning (enemy nasus is shoving his wave with e, trying to get the cs, this means Nasus denies himself q stacks, Nasus walks forward to q a minion, the enemy laner goes after him, best case scenario kills him, worst case scenario makes their jungler waste time/get chunked) \r\n\r\n6. work on your map awareness\r\n7. react to enemy spells being down (you are a fed player, the only way the enemy yi can kill you 1v1 is if he dukes one of your key abilities with his q, you wait for him to waste it then go balls deep on him, he dies)","replies":[{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2015-03-29T13:11:28.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At low levels people don't even check the scoreboard for items. Junglers don't know how to gank or help a losing lane. They don't know how to play defensive or even buy defensive items. If a solo laner gives up a few kills it will snowball. So pick early game champs if you are Wood level. Get out of bronze and then pick late game champs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Worst Mid Ever","date":"2015-03-29T10:42:11.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"step 1. buy {{champion:55}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:113}} \nstep 2. play {{champion:55}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:113}}","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-29T11:13:51.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2 of these 3 champs are in the top bans list, and shouldn't be relied on for getting in ranked, the other is only good if your team can follow up and bring damage/you have a decent Yasuo (not likely in low elo.) on your team\n\nChamps that are actually easy for low elo players that aren't on nearly everyones ban lists:\n\n{{champion:1}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:50}} \n\nThese champions are simple, have CC in some form (4 have AoE CC that isn't silence/slow) and if are behind in the game, can still be relevant for mid-late game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-03-29T08:34:19.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree whole heartedly with the first point.
