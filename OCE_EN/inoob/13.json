Minion hp, depending on the amount of AD your ADC has early game, you may need to help balance the minions hp. A lot of times I have seen adcs with the 3 attack speed quint start get shoved in and can't last hit under tower due to a lack of ad, their support doesn't do much to help them and when the AD goes to get the last hit the minion is slightly too healthy so they lose the cs, this can cause a lot of cs to be missed.\r\n\r\n2. Abilities, make sure your abilities aren't denying your ADC cs, think Blitzcrank r when he gets near his ADC's creeps. \r\n\r\n3. Vision and knowledge of champions, a very straight forward but basic example of what **could **happen, if you don't read the game correctly. \r\n\r\nYou are Ashe, you have a Leona support, the enemy is Graves/Thresh, their mid laner is Twisted Fate and Jungler pantheon, you are shoving the lane in and everyone is level 6+ and all of them have summoners, you are deeper on their side of the lane and Leona has engaged onto Graves, you go in and follow up with an ult, at that very moment you have forgotten to check the minimap and Pantheon/TF have ulted bottom for a double kill, while Graves has survived after Flash healing and being protected by name. \r\n\r\n4. Protect your ADC, unless he can't farm and has 0 kills your main goal should be to protect him as well as the most influential person on your team, but more your ADC. Why? Well your ADC needs vision and protection, what if they go to try and farm bot but Lucian/Thresh have freezed it, and the minion wave is pushing to them? he is now going to miss a solid amount of cs! Unless you know you can make a good play somewhere else, at the expense of your ADCs cs, do it, but make sure your ADC doesn't go dying for those few cs and accompanies you. \r\n\r\n5. Shoving the first wave, but not denying your ADC, if you are supping a say Morgana/Janna/Gragas etc etc, use your aoe abilities to help shove, for morgana w the cs so it pushes, you do this so you rush level 2 so you can go for an all in exchange. Think Morgana q > w into a Graves e > q, onto an unsuspecting Ashe.\r\n\r\n6. if you are snowballing as a support like Morgana or Annie, who deal a lot of damage, go for ap items and just go with a pink + green ward for vision, this will allow you to deal a significant amount of dmg onto their carry, snowballing your lead further, it is a bit of a risk game I know. \r\n\r\n7. if your AD can't last hit properly ask him if he is alright, once he answers yes, let him know you will afk if he keeps missing. \r\n(don't really afk, just tell him you will)","replies":[{"poster":"idc","date":"2015-01-04T02:04:28.128+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't sure if I was going to take you seriously, until I read the last point.\n\nGood day.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daemoon","date":"2015-01-04T02:02:44.566+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=iNoob,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=6fI98q3X,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-01-03T08:17:59.496+0000)\n>\n>\n> 7. if your AD can't last hit properly ask him if he is alright, once he answers yes, let him know you will afk if he keeps missing. \n> (don't really afk, just tell him you will)\n\nYou're seriously advocating a negative attitude like this? \nPlease ignore this boy.","replies":[]}]}
