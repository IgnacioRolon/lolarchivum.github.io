Quite frankly, I think it should be removed from any non-custom game modes. Communicating with the enemy team is, for all intents and purposes, drawing in the same sort of crowd and initiative as cross-faction chatting did in World of Warcraft, hence its removal. Players in the aforementioned game cannot communicate with each other if they are not part of the same faction - generally speaking, you'll treat your own faction well. If that doesn't prove to be the case, reporting comes in handy.\r\n\r\nIt is in my opinion that League of Legends should be the same, where you cannot speak to the enemy team, thus disallowing any negative comments, bickering and bantering or what ever else. I realize this could cause issues with \"report this person for x\", but if you think about it, that's also being toxic, it can cause some people to \"troll\" and as a whole it causes more fighting. \r\n\r\nI'd like to see some initiative on Riot's part to truly alleviate the community of all the issues that it is having in regards to people being cruel or unsportsmanlike with each other. Personally, I'd like to cut back on all of the nonsense because I am progressively leaning toward becoming a more serious player, and it honestly hurts my game when I have enemies telling me that I'm bad because I'm not on my A-game. \r\n\r\nAs a whole, I think that it would help a lot of players to not hear the negativity of the enemy team. When you're losing, you'll talk smack. When you're winning, you'll gloat. None of it is positive behavior and no one is going to get banned for it. So I say we get rid of all chat and take away one problem and start working on the next, where team negativity becomes an issue. \r\n\r\nJust a suggestion, thought, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2015-01-05T18:11:01.350+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"All chat is like Automatic car windows. It isn't a necessary thing to posses, but it is nice to have there to use at your desire. Sometimes the window may get dirty when used, but it isn't as troublesome as to halt the usage of it. Sometimes it is clean, and that is when it is most enjoyable.\n\n(Hooray for similes. Not the best entity for comparison, but it gets the message through)","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-07T08:30:16.471+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't agree with this. You've just taken all the negative points of all-chat, clumped them together and said it's all that there is; it isn't.\n\nWhy not mention \"gl hf\" and \"gg wp\"? Because using all chat for being an honourable opponent will make all chat seem better? If we disable all chat then people won't be able to introduce themselves to the enemy/wish the good fortune. I don't know about others but I feel weird if I just verse someone else (a living being) while remaining completely silent. Makes it feel more mechanical, and overall unenjoyable.\n\nThat and you're removing the ability for people to express their personalities to the enemy team. If all chat is disabled then all that's left is play without context. I don't think we should remove that just to shave off a bit of toxicity. Should we remove taunts and jokes as well because it encourages smack talk?\n\nAnd this point you make:\n>When you're losing, you'll talk smack. When you're winning, you'll gloat\n\nThat's up to the individual; not everyone is going to act like an immature child. Isn't that generalisation?\n\nAnd Riot have already done something *about* toxicity in all chat. There's an option to turn it off. If you're finding it really offensive and unsportsmanlike for some reason, you can always do that. Additionally, all chat is off by default. People who don't know about it might never find out about it, or it'll at least reduce the total amount of people who use it.\n\nI'm happy with the way communication currently is regarding chat in game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riso","date":"2015-01-06T12:09:04.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think all chat isn't to bad if you just want to help with the community. Like talking to the enemies actually might not be bad and just for entertainment purposes. It is also great for newer people or people that aren't up to date with the patch notes to confirm with the opposing players to clear pup confusion. I hate to say it is mistreated but it is something that grows the community as a whole.\nTL;DR - It's not bad for its original purpose","replies":[]},{"poster":"PeachTea","date":"2015-01-06T07:24:21.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, all chat is unnecessary. Maybe there could be a test period where they remove all chat and see if it makes any improvement. Maybe there will be less reporting, less leavers, something like that to show us that it works, or maybe it wont. It would be nice to find out either way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-01-06T01:44:57.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or you know, we could just ban the %%%%s that use all chat in %%%%y ways so that we can keep all chat for the people who use it decently?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-05T17:49:29.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like this idea.

At all.\nOOOOH, SEE WHAT I DID THERE?\nI do like all chat is customs, but that is because in customs I am generally playing against my friends to see where we match up against each other, and to show each other a few things. If anything, all chat can just be a distraction in game.","replies":[]}]}
