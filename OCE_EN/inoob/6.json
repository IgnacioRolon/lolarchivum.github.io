Especially on OCE where server stability is... Well, when I can have AFK's twenty games in a row on my side thanks to connection issues, the amount of games I need to play in order to rank up gets a bit ridiculous. It's the problem of being a 5v5, you are reliant on those four on your team not to just feed horribly.\n\nIf they play defensively and you can get rolling? Sure, you should be able to carry. If they get d/c'd, die a lot, etc, then you will lose regardless of how well you do. The only exceptions to that are crazy backdoor plays and champs like Riven. If you can get a few levels up on Riven, and an item or two, then it's hard enough to shut you down that you might win it. Unless you die, then it's gg, wp, insert coin and try again.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-04-14T13:44:15.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"O_O. They are onto us.
