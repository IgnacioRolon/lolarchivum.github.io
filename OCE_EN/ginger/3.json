Other changes aren&#039;t enough to overcome this.\n\nNot being able to stack boxes is also a huge nerf\n\nNew rework is good for AD, shit for AP. Please make some changes.\n\nJust wanted to put my thoughts out there.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-11-09T01:32:19.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure it's shit for both.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-11-09T00:18:56.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have an extra ap ratio on the q.\n\nI also play alot of shaco and I enjoy ap jungle, ad jungle, tank jungle, ap top and ap support shaco builds. As much as I feel the dynamics of how shaco will be played in each of these identities will change dramatically, ap shaco isn't exactly the biggest hit. \n\nAD shaco is losing alot of burst and early game dominance (his main strength in comparison to ap), and tank shaco is losing alot of initiation and base damage (harder to play, no longer has strength of the ages so must rush tank items earlier and get to a strong midgame position without giving up on early pressure). \n\nAP shaco is losing the ability to stack boxes and backstab hurts ganking alot but the passive will help with early (after the first few) clears and his new q has an ap ratio meaning that you are harder to itemise against and with lichbane this damage is going to be fun since it already hit hard before the ap ratio. Not to mention ap shaco will benefit slightly more from the tankier boxes and the fact he can put them down whilst in stealth (though it does reveal you temporarily).\n\nI've been watching how shaco has been doing from streams of the PBE and before this release, riot really clamped down on him, but with the final numbers and changes, it's only a minor nerf to most types of shaco, and lategame ap shaco is going to so deadly now.\n\nAlso even though the lvl1 q stealth is rather pathetic, with a few points in it, it's much more powerful since you won't get wrecked if the enemy team is clever enough to buy pinks and red trinket.","replies":[]}]}
