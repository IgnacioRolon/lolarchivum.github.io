He&#039;s still far weaker than before with the arm time nerf and duration nerf. Given how over powered the other reworked champions are, why is Teemo allowed to remain so much weaker than before. Especially considering he didn&#039;t even need a rework and was perfectly balanced.\r\n\r\nI know I&#039;m ranting, but I genuinely want some feedback from Riot. I love this game and I love your updates, but as a Teemo main I feel as though you&#039;re just nerfing Teemo because some players don&#039;t like him. I feel like my favourite champion is being ignored so that you don&#039;t have to deal with him. I&#039;m sure most Teemo mains would rather have had our damage nerfed than half our shroom time AND increase the arm time which has made trading properly impossible.","replies":[{"poster":"SailorAids","date":"2015-09-07T03:06:49.360+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:103}} is a slut!","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-09-07T03:20:46.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She charms people doesn't she?\nWhy do u think she does it?\n;)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-09-06T21:59:33.187+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"as a teemo main\"\n\"teemo\"\n\"main\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-06T22:37:48.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"ow plz get a {{item:1314}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3136}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3085}}  you get a perma slow with your e a q that dose 700 every 4 sec and a ult the will 1 shot any adc mid or any one with less then 2k hp he don't need a buff your just bad","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-09-06T23:09:29.650+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"His E doesn't apply Spell Effects (Rylai's).","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-09-07T01:50:06.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what did you delete","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-07T06:00:33.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and every one is still doing teemo like old temo but with his new ult he is op af as he can trow a 600 damage slow at your team that's 1800 damage + if you got a {{item:3151}} you do % damage witch is a huge buff for this patch as there are a tone of tanks coff coff garen op","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-09-07T02:21:47.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something about Ahri.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-07T05:55:19.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe its a bug cos last night it was I could just basic attack and perma slow it works with cogath e to","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-09-07T01:40:27.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"right. because its an aa dot. and aa dots do jack all with spell effects","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-09-06T23:44:13.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hear ya Ginger. I did a thread about this a while ago when the nerf first hit ( http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/7pwxsVVu-you-have-destroyed-teemo ). All my thoughts are in there.\n\nThey basically turned him into a lame, boring duellist, rather than someone who had strategy and could set up hit and run tactic ganks/initiations. As you mentioned, I'd rather have his damage nerfed than his mushie duration. Even if they brought it back up to 7 minutes or put a cap on, it'd still be better than 5 minutes, which is barely enough time to got around the jungle and grow your mushie farm, before the first one you place expires.\n\nI think you hit the nail on the head. Teemo was perfectly balanced, but because Riot feels the need to \"fix\" things, even if they aren't broke, and because whiners like to hate on furry satan, they just had to mess with him. With his new R bounce, there's little reason to leave lane and set up elaborate ploys to drag your enemies into traps, so he's basically a boring arse duellist and has killed him.\n\nBRING BACK THE OLD TEEMO!","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-09-07T01:46:09.038+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Teemo needs nerf if you can build him right, you just can't. simple facts.\n\nYou have no idea of the power of sated teemo.\n\nShroom field. \n\nOut of nowhere....\n\na blind and 2 hit kills you...\n\nYour tank....\n\nmakes the mistake.... \n\nof walking on a shroom...\n\n4 hits are coming his way.......\n\nHe dies....\n\nwith the single thought of....\n\nwtf... \n\nrito nerf plz...\n\nps. he never had strategy. used to be lay shroom field and hope someone low hp stood on them","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-09-07T04:08:09.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) Teemo no longer has the option of waiting in a bush for someone to come and step on a mushie then kill them, because mushies don't last anywhere near that long. He used to be able to leave lane and go jungling and it was interesting because it was the trade off of lane pressure vs vision/jungle pressure/skirmishing. Now the mushies disappear so quickly, there's little reason to place them further outside of lane.\n\n2) Yes of course he had strategy! You'd shroom up the jungle, then harass enemy flanks. They could follow you into the jungle and you'd have to lead them properly through the pathways properly. Or they could ignore you and take your poke. This was of course after Teemo had to decide to leave lane unpressured to set this up, and commit to jungle pressure and vision instead, a heavy trade off you'd have to weigh up.\n\nNow there's little reason to venture out of lane, so now he's boring as f.\n\n3) YOU are the reason Teemo got nerfed. Too stupid to understand that wandering through the jungle without a lens and a Teemo in game, was a terrible idea (even as a tank), and too stupid to understand how to build to counter him. Instead of being bad and being like everyone who complains that X champ needs a nerf because they're so \"OP\", learn how to play so that perfectly balanced champs don't need to get nerfed.\n\nDrops mic.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-09-07T07:30:07.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol this guy, Cracks Me Up\n\nWho even cares its teemo.
