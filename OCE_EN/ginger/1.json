It&#039;s strange because my original login name is not common at all.\r\n\r\nThey don&#039;t have access to my email, but I&#039;m still concerned. If I go a long time without logging in, is it possible this person might get my account changed since it looks like it&#039;s inactive and he/she lost access to my email or something?","replies":[{"poster":"Chronicc","date":"2017-09-18T05:40:41.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as long as your email is secure and your password is strong you will be fine","replies":[]}]}
