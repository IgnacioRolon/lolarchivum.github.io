In the post the Rioter attests to this fact.\r\nHere is a link of when the server transfers were available.\r\n\r\nhttp://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/special-event/league-legends-lands-oceania\r\n\r\nSo it has been 2 years + since the release of the oceanic server as open beta...\r\n\r\nThere is no shortage of ideas, and I do understand the situation that Riot is in being that culturally they want the skin to reflect upon everyone but there is no way it should take this amount of time, even with all the community suggestions that we're supposedly handed over to the design team working on it.\r\nRito pls?\r\n\r\nHelp me upvote on reddit so that this gets more traction if you think it needs it.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-06T09:38:38.757+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's the big deal?
