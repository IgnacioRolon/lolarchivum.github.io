I have come up with three possible solutions but if anyone has any other solutions they should comment.\r\n\r\n**Solution A**\r\nLower/Change the requirements for the icon to the following:\r\nAssuming there are 3 icons.\r\nTier I Icon - Players who had at least 50 matched games(Win or Loss).\r\nTier II Icon - Players who had at least 50 matches games and at least 25 wins.\r\nTier III Icon - Players who had at least 100 matched games and at least 50wins.\r\n\r\nThis would be ideal as it scales the requirements to compensate for the lack of queue here.\r\n\r\n**Solution B**\r\nOpen the queue temporarily(As a OCE featured game mode):\r\nPlayers would be able to accumulate wins during this time, however only players whose account existed before the the arrival of the OCE server(Thursday, 27 June 2013) would qualify for the icons. (Changing the requirement to 100+ Wins and Account existing before 27/5/2013)\r\nThis also allows newer OCE players to experience proper dominion games.\r\n\r\n**Solution C**\r\nAllow OCE players to transfer to another server to get the remaining wins:\r\nRiot Games may get backlash if they go this approach, however, money makes the decisions and if they do this they&#039;re getting approx $50 per icon($25 to transfer out, $25 to transfer in). New players wouldn&#039;t be able to get 100wins in the current remaining time frame.\r\n\r\nAll of these solutions are viable as they still stand with Riot&#039;s wishes to only award the dedicated players who put in the time before the snapshot date. \r\n\r\nTL;DR;\r\nRiot OCE expected players to reach the same requirement as other servers in 42% of the time. They should change the requirement.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-02-14T19:57:34.466+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It isn't fair, and RIOT knows it, they just cant be fucked doing anything about it. Its just like how we are unable to get the Ranked 3v3 icons. Unless we switch server play ranked and switch back, its impossible for us to get it. But they don't care.\n\nI personally favour Solution B. if you're going to announce limited edition content, you need a way for people to earn it. its like if they just retired DJ Sona to the 'never coming back vault' with no warning and said \"if you haven't already bought it, bad luck!\"\n\nI played on the NA server for a while before OCE came out but I have no wins on dominion, it wasn't my favourite game mode, and i was still relatively new to Lol and was thought i would get better quicker if i just focused on the main game mode for now, instead of trying to learn 2 or 3 at once. As a result I have no wins on dominion and am not eligible for the icon.\nI'm saying this because it shows that no matter what happens, even if RIOT lowers the requirements i wont get the Icon, so you know if i say that it is 'Unfair' to OCE players, you know that i am not saying it just because i want an icon (because i know i cant get it) so you know i speak without bias.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2016-02-15T09:19:35.820+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Love it how  there's no \"option\" for players who never got to try dominion to get the icon. -_-","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-02-15T10:16:02.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> but we get no money out of it -rito","replies":[]}]}
