Sorry about that.\n\nI can understand the reasoning for this for servers that do have a dominion queue, but it is extremely unfair for OCE players.\n\nThere's a major difference between distributing a reward for players that **had the chance** and did put in the time, compared to those who **didn't have a chance** at all.\n\nWith the OCE server originally arriving 27th/June/2013, Almost **3 years ago**, Not once did you ever open the dominion queue.\nScratch that, That statement is incorrect as Riot OCE did actually open dominion queue briefly(for less than 40minutes) back around 2014-Jan/Feb when the servers were getting DDOSed, Riot OCE decided to turn the servers off, and when they turned it back on, They must've \"accidentally\" left dominion queue on.(This sucked cause it got me and my friends hopes up).\n\nSomething needs to be done for OCE, that both follows Riot's wish to reward only dedicated past players as well as allowing those past players to have a proper chance.","replies":[]}]}]}
