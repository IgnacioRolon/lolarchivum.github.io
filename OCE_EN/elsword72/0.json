I was Silver 5 on my last account, and I expect this account to get into the same rank as before. However, after playing 8 games, I noticed that there were Golds in my games and I met 2 Platinums. So I decided to check my MMR on OP.GG and was shocked to find that I would most likely be placed in Gold V.\r\nI have been struggling in all my games, as a top laner and as a support. To be honest with you, I don&#039;t think my mechanics are up to a Platinum or even a Gold player. Is the MMR shown my OP.GG inaccurate? Will I be placed in high Bronze/Low Silver like I expected?\r\nI am currently 4/4, pls help :D","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-17T04:19:22.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes it is. You can't go by that at all. I have the same problem. I am bronze 4 and I get mostly silvers and a few golds. To which I am not ready for because I can't climb in games. Catch 22 that never ends.","replies":[]}]}
