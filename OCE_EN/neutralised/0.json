Im so sick of seeing all this money grabbing content bs when the game I&#039;ve poured so much of my life into is a fkn cesspool of frustration. All the egotistical maniacs that control the outcome of the game not by skill as the system should nurture but on a players whim and willingness to try to win. \n\nThe only stats I ever see from riot are political and beneficial to their image and completely useless out of context. Where are the stats that show ranked law of averages. Out of 100 games how many will be 4v5? Out of 100 games if x games are won/lost due to toxic behavior how many reports will lead to bans? Where are the stats that show Riots systems coming into effect and improving these law of averages (pre/post system). All the silence and lack of transparency towards improving the ranked experience and creating an environment where players go to play their best and try to win lead me to believe that Riot simply doesnt give a fk about competitive players.\n\nI asked a teammate that was afk in base why he wants to troll knowing he will probably get placed into low priority queue. His response perfectly sums up the opinions of all these losers that go into ranked just to make people miserable. He said &#039;who cares about low priority queue&#039; and he is exactly right. The punishments for ruining games are so weak that they are negligible. IMO if someone has internet issues and d/c from a couple of ranked games a 5x5min LPQ punishment is not justice, whilst it was never there intentions to leave the game the result is the same. If the punishments cause people to think about whether or not they should be playing ranked then we would see less people exploiting the weak punishments to ruin games. 5min LPQ should just be scrapped altogether, straight to 20min and then bans.\n\nAll I want to do is play ranked with teammates that also want to try hard and win but instead this is the system and the dev we have.\n\nTL:DR Weak punishments allow players to troll as there is little consequence which in turn breeds more toxicity and more lose lose situations.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-12-05T11:50:00.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're looking for Riot Games' transparency on negative issues, check out these two talks [here](http://gdcvault.com/play/1017940/The-Science-Behind-Shaping-Player) and [here](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022160/More-Science-Behind-Shaping-Player). They are about toxicity in games.\n\nAs for AFKing you can be perma-banned for continuous AFKing. If you continuously AFK this can get serious really quick, I know so many people who don't even try and get knee deep in that shit. Also from past experience I've found that AFK punishments never reset. All of this considered I think the current system is fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-12-04T14:00:13.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PREACH IT SISTER. now sit down, let this thread rot in a corner and let riot make their shitty chroma packs while we inch closer to losing as much sanity as we have time to this game","replies":[]}]}
