But if they do really bad or I don't trust some of them (e.g trolls, toxic players I've met before, players who hold ults/aoes for single kills instead of clusters), I get Doran's shield then start going tanky to block skill shots from hitting allies or plainly just tank until it opens up for my team to go in and I don't upgrade spell thief unless I'm still laning along side our adc and were both doing well. But if they do really good  (usually 7-10 kill lead) pretty much the same thing except I don't buy doran's shield and I start going damage Then start winning solo ques in like 11-19 minutes on ARAM or SR hopefully. #nosociallife T_T I'm not a narcissist...I'm just really sick of greedy players, I might even quit aram now though.
