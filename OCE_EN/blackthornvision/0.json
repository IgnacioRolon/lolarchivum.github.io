I&#039;ve been playing League since 2013 and was banned 2 months ago (roughly). From the time from my account being created to my account being banned, I&#039;ve had plenty of off games which resulted in me being banned permanently. My last warning which was a (15 game?) chat restriction was given to me roughly 6 months prior to me getting banned which I think is stupid. Yes I had one bad game in a few months which yes was ranked and yes I did feed and I do get that I should&#039;ve been punished for that but a perma ban? Come on riot, I thought you were better than that, at least give people a cool down period because the ban hit me hard. To think that all the money and time i spent playing. Anyway, just thought I&#039;d put my 2 cents in.","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-09-20T01:42:40.672+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Usually to jump punishment teirs you either need to be scripting which is an instant perma or hit one of the special triggers around super toxic stuff like telling people to kill them selves","replies":[{"poster":"Blackthornvision","date":"2017-09-20T01:47:39.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only have the chatlog of one game whenever I try to login and no mentioned of kys anywhere, when I spoke to riot they also had no mention of that either.

If you were saying things like you describe I'm not surprised you got jumped to the perma, and that's not even considering the fact that you were intent feeding as well.\n\nYou only drop tiers if you are demonstrating neutral or positive behaviour, so if you are still being negative, but not to the point of a punishment, you are effectively waiving that.\n\nIf you want us to highlight all of what got you banned, then you are more than welcome to post your logs here, but from what you have said, the ban was deserved.","replies":[{"poster":"Blackthornvision","date":"2017-09-20T02:56:03.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get it, I'd just like another chance is all.
