I belive these items will be just for the new gamemode coming in the next patch (correct me if im wrong) however i think implementing them into the normal gametype will greatly increase the variety of AP items which Riot clearly are looking for considering the changes to AP items in the last patch. Lack a split pusher? Build Rite of Ruin! Needing more kiting ability? Build Netherstride Grimoire! And finally when using an AOE poke comp build Pox Arcana!\r\nI&#039;ve been thinking quite in depth about the champions that would be able to utilize these items and i feel the amount is rather extensive.\r\n\r\nPlease give input and opinions below!\r\nThanks alot! \r\n\r\n-NuckkFugget (OCE)","replies":[{"poster":"Arcane1140","date":"2015-07-26T01:22:58.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree completely, the three books have similar stats but a completely different passive, making one of the three items massively helpful to **all** mana dependent ap mid laners whether they need some pushing power, movement speed, or a really helpful mana regenerating aoe that does damage based on how good you poke. I really hope that they aren't just for the new gamemode because these items help diversify champions, causing the game more fun and challenging.","replies":[{"poster":"NuckkFugget","date":"2015-07-26T02:12:27.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i completely agree however i also think they could improve the AP junglers considering the basic \"lost chapter gives the same amount of mana regen as when upgraded! I was thinking along the lines of geting your jungler item then lost chapter before getting the enchantment. These Items could really help some of the forgotten champs in LOL","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-26T07:17:51.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or instead you could just go to runeglaive which stops your mana problems as an AP jungler.\n\nAnd the full upgrade cost's less as well.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
