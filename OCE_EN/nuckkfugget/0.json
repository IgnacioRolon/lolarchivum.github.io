As you can probably tell, I was wondering whether either AD or AP Eve was better? I know that with the currently changed AP items you can build including Liandry&#039;s Torment and Rylai&#039;s with the new runeglaive helping her out too.\r\n\r\nHowever alternatively, the Warrior enchant with possibly Black Clever and  Tri Force could create a solid all around AD bruiser jungler.\r\n\r\nPlease share your experiences about going down either option or just what you think works best for her kit and for the current meta.\r\n\r\n-NuckkFugget (OCE)","replies":[{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-07-16T10:18:41.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you are going to play Evelynn Jungle AP will probably be better because of the item runeglaive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-07-16T09:23:27.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Neither, the best way to play evelynn is hybrid.
