Having the other 4 members on your team surrender when you clearly have a chance in the game. It is so stupid that you can vote no to surrender and yet, your team can just say &quot;screw you&quot; and you lose LP for that. I lost LP for no other reason than the people I was on a team with.

I reckon they should just remove the surrender button altogether in ranked... or maybe extend it to like 50 mins or something. It really frustrates me when people surrender because we had a bad early game ... even though we have an obvious late game comp. I mean just look at how many teams surrender in the pro leagues.. like none. and especially in low elo the chance for a comeback is way higher. I feel your pain. I guess the only thing you can do is explain to your team that you can come back and win  and just ask them to trust you. or at least say that you can gain more IP the longer you play. but yea.

(besides losing of course. you will lose 80% of all games in 4/5 surrender cases btw, maybe even more, you will). after that, you hate your teammates, your teammates hate the not-surrendering guy, you've lost a bit of love and trust for the game and your future teammates, so have most of your teammates, for however long a time. the angry people are angrier cos they were right, the angry not-surrendering guy is angry cos hes toxic, sorry just kidding, i mean, cos hes 13 and cant handle losing and has to find a way to make up for not being able to back up his egotistical persona on an online game with nothing but wins next to his match history cos he thinks he cant and shouldnt lose at all\n\nso in every 4/5 surrender, it will be 4/5 bronzeys saying to riot that the 1/5 bronzey cant carry the game (or 4/5 challengers saying that the 1/5 challenger cant carry) (i mentioned elo's to bring up that, with everyone being in relatively similar elo's, barring miracle plays, everyone is roughly the same skill level). if you dont think YOU can carry a game, you have ABSOLUTELY NO BUSINESS saying you shouldnt surrender. the onus is on YOU to change peoples minds about the games past and current state, in which you convince them, most likely through your gameplay, that you yourself are good enough to have improved so much, to a level that, with your teammates playing equally as well as they have now, maybe with a slight improvement, that they dont think they will completely lose the game. instead, they will think they have more than a chance of turning it around and going on to winning.\n\nif 80% (4/5)  of the people on your team want to surrender, who is more likely to be correct here? with the previous points of teammates losing their passion to try as hard as they can, the desire to play at all, and the hope to win, what makes you say that the 1 person who is probably delusional, would be right, not 20% of the time (their supposed stake in the team (1/5)), but, in order for you to have your way, you would need that 1 person not wanting to surrender, out of the other 4/5 players, to be correct, not 79% of the time, but 80% of EVERY 4/5 SURRENDER. you're saying for EVERYONE to be still playing, the ONLY one who should be right, 80% or more of the time, should be the one who DOES NOT want to surrender. the ONLY one who will still have the passion/desire/hope, about what i said above. you're saying YOU, are 60% more likely to be correct over your 4/5 equally-ranked teammates. you're saying YOU and every other person who is 1/5 for not wanting to surrender, is 60% more likely to be correct, and that THIS is the stupidest part of league\n\nthis is all not taking into account the actual specific gameplay elements, obviously specific late game comps have a slightly-to-very much higher chance of winning in the late game. these kinds of issues can be solved by just talking to your teammates. if they dont agree with you, if all 4/5 of your teammates dont agree with you, theres a chance that, maybe, 5 kills to 24, maybe there wont be a late game, and you should surrender right now, before they just beat you in 5-15 minutes, which would just end up being a waste of 20-60 minutes of the other peoples lives.\n\nof all the different surrender variations to complain about, you complain about the least harmful one, to the community, and to all...cases of variations of surrendering that affect your teammates or something. see eventually, the people that are supposedly good, and dont surrender and just play with their hearts content in which they cant be reported for feeding or afk'ing, some of them are kids, and some of them are gonna crack, which creates the toxicity we see all over the place today. 1 person wanting to continue a game cos of the smallest 20% chance that they can still win, or cos its just fun, or cos they want more IP, is incredibly more destructive to the entire game than 4 people just wanting to end a game cos they know they've lost and they wanna move on\n\ndo you have any idea how much pro scrims (practice games between pro teams) are ended when 1st blood/1st tower is given up? A LOT. maybe most of them. it applies to this case because, although 1st bloods/towers are not as influential in solo queue, its so much easier to snowball now than ever. everyone knows that. the average global time for every single game has gone down by like, i think it was 5 minutes. snowballing is a lot easier, therefore surrendering will be the better option in a lot more games (taking into account the long term health and behaviour of the playerbase). especially in the cases of 80% of a team wanting to surrender though\n\n\nTLDR you're so wrong lol smh","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-03-21T22:58:22.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lay down the pube hammer","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-03-21T10:12:05.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's defeatism for you.
