Can you try to disable any antivirus applications/firewalls that you may have running? This might include Windows Firewall, Ad-Aware, etc. Secondly, try to run the lol.launcher.admin.exe file in your League of Legends folder. Let me know if the launcher opens up after you've done these things.","replies":[]}]}
