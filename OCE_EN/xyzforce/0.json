Since the Lunar Revel is also approaching, I was thinking that Zac could have a new skin that is related to an Asian food, aka. Rice Cake. I know that this idea sounds super crazy and that Riot will 99.9% disapprove of it, but I'm just a summoner with a cool concept that would like the community to hear about. Just because it's 'Rice Cake', doesn't mean it has to be white. I'll leave Riot in charge of deciding the colour scheme of this skin (despite it's chances of being considered). I'm not the best artist so I'll make this all understandable with the vocabulary I have and you'll just have to use your imagination and visualize it (I'm sorry XD).\n\nInformation: {{champion:154}} \n\nPrice: 975/1350 RP\nType of skin: Visual and Ability texture changes/Recall animation changes\n\nMoving on to champion & ability changes: {{champion:154}} \n\nChampion changes: Resembling a man made of rice cake sticks (if you don't know what it looks like, simply Google: Rice cake sticks, and you'll get what I mean)\n\nAbilities: {{champion:154}} \n\nPassive: 4 white Rice cake sticks crawling like caterpillars, joining to reform Rice Cake Zac.\n\nStretching Strike (Q): {{champion:154}} Zac's two Rice Cake arms stretch out, leaving a visual mark on the target it hit (since rice cakes are adhesive/sticks to things easily), for a few seconds. NOTE: Just a visual mark, but it does also intimidate the enemy champion, as they might think it's a debuff.\n\nUnstable matter (W): {{champion:154}}  Zac's body erupts, dealing damage and leaving a pool of 'Rice Cake goo' around him. Also has the visual mark effect that the Q has.\n\nElastic Slingshot (E): {{champion:154}} Zac channels briefly, before leaving a rice cake mark on the  terrain (that Zac channeled on) and jumping into combat. Since Zac leaves a mark on the terrain, the enemy knows that Zac has jumped. The reason why I thought of this is because since Zac's Q and W both have a intimidating mark on the enemy champion/target hit, why not do something that helps the enemy team as well. As Riot stated in a post, Clarity and Champion Development are quite important as league develops as the years go by. \n\nLet's Bounce (R/Ultimate): {{champion:154}}  Zac jumps 3 times, knocking up and slowing enemies it hits. Similar to his W, Zac's ult also leaves a 'Rice Cake goo' on each champion its hits with its ultimate. You can also chain the ultimate and spamming W to create even more 'Rice Cake' Chaos and mess. This leaves opponents with fear. \n\nIn conclusion, my Rice Cake Zac concept is just a celebration skin for the 2015 Lunar Revel event. As mentioned earlier, it's up to Riot who would consider the RP pricing of the skin, but I do recommend the skin being a 975/1350 RP skin, as particle changes or even new animations do appear in this skin. If Riot could develop on this 'Rice Cake Zac' skin concept of mine even more, it'll be awesome for a 1350 RP price tag.\n\nThank you all for reading,\n\nEnjoy the game! \n\nXYZForce {{champion:154}}","replies":[{"poster":"XYZForce","date":"2015-01-10T11:18:34.657+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The part where they give the 'visual debuff' thing on enemy champions is just part of the skin though, it would be alright if they made it momentarily as well; I can understand what you mean. The examples you mentioned are true, maybe it's just a matter of Riot even taking this skin into consideration compared to other player concepts which may be 200% better than this. After all, I'm just typing what came into my mind when I thought of 'Rice Cake Zac'...:) {{champion:154}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"canijo","date":"2015-01-10T07:07:30.694+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I doubt Riot games is going to nerf/buff a champion with skins, I mean, skins that make champions look bigger do buff the champion in the way that the hitbox is not as clear for skillshots, but to give opponents a mark to show where zac has jumped from is actually going to require that mechanic being added to every single skin, classic included. The mark from Q, W and Ultimate would also be something they'd need to add mechanically into the game if it were to stick to enemy champions, if it were to stick on the ground momentarily as a particle effect, Riot could take that into a count. Every single mark left on an enemy champion does signify a mechanic, whether it would be Katarina's Bouncing Blade proc, Akali's Mark of the Assassin. Everything that would give a player awareness is a mechanic. Katarina can check brushes with her Death Lotus's contrast. People can have a clue of where Fiddlesticks may be due to Dread. A skin cannot give a champion different mechanics.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-10T07:10:10.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think he should be made of Ramen.","replies":[]}]}
