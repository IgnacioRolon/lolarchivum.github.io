At first I stayed calm, after that I got really angry so I just muted them, then after couple minutes un muted them and they were still being rude and cruel to me. I did accidentally steal some kills but most of the kills I got were mine. I also have video footage, from LoLReplay. I can send you some footage but I might upload some really bad parts to YouTube. A lot of people die each year from this sort of stuff, just sending you this so you can posting this so you guys can be aware of how much this little chat can affect someones life.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-02-03T01:55:41.450+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey dude,\n\nReally sorry you had to go through that negative experience.

Does Riot support know that we don't have the Tribunal yet?\n\nThere's a really big difference between people just being mean/rude, and people going as far as to describe how you should kill yourself, who finds you, etc.\n\nOne of my friends that I play with often was abused a few weeks ago. He had someone tell him how much he hoped his mother died, and when my friend pointed out that his mother was already dead, the disgusting level of abuse just increased. This isn't content that should even be shown at the LoL Tribunal (when we get it), but to the Australian police..","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-02-03T08:20:34.937+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh that's interesting I will get in touch with the support team to adjust their messaging.

From what they witness though, and it is often the only time they will see that player, that player is a highly angry and abusive player. That's the problem. Obviously though, you can't just tell a player to dismiss it and say \"Its probably the only time they will do this\", because people can become repeat offenders and if there is no threat of punishment they will feel like its something they can repeat and get away with.\nA group in the playerbase will say \"Just ban these people\", but the problem is that means a lot of generally good people will be forced from the game. Like Lyte says though, you guys at Riot think it can be possible to help modify and shape your players' behaviours. I think that is an admirable goal which says a lot about the company.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TickleMyPickleXD","date":"2015-02-06T09:11:54.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How come i post the same thing as this guy but it just gets removed? and this guy just gets the pic removed?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2015-02-04T03:27:45.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just wondering how the intentional feeder bans are calculated.

There are some, whether by their own faults or by a flawed psychological state imposed upon them by external factors, who don't have the mental capacity to handle things like this. And I'm not talking about the people who do these things for attention, but the people with legitimate issues. Just because the majority knows to ignore these things doesn't mean that the minority should be ignored, because there's a very real chance that these trolls will one day say something like this to the wrong person and directly contribute to someone injuring themselves.\n\nIs it a stupid practice, and are the people who participate in it, whether legitimate mental issues or simply filling a stereotypical role stupid for hurting themselves? Of course. But they don't need encouragement from other human beings who can't differentiate between their actions online creating consequences offline. Yes they're failed trolls, and yes they should be ignored. But that doesn't alter in any way that they're treating someone else as less than human over a damned game. \n\nLetting behavior like this go unpunished at the tip of the iceberg is what allows the other 90% below the surface to become so large.","replies":[{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2015-02-02T21:56:54.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tldr","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Chapter","date":"2015-02-03T09:54:26.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tldr: \nread it ya lazy bum","replies":[{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2015-02-04T03:28:31.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fine","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SynG Valor","date":"2015-02-02T22:52:07.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why are people serious in normal, this is just a game.
