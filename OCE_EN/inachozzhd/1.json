Why should we say the whole lane name when we can just say M whats Mid, T for Top, A for ADC or Ad for ADC, S for Supp and J for jg. Its much quicker and much better, because if you say the whole mid name then your wasting time and someone else most likely got the lane before you. Just recommended but we need this language in LoL.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-02-15T08:25:25.246+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or you could stop encouraging people to become even more illiterate and actually call out the position properly.\n\nTop Lane, Middle Lane, Jungle, etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2015-02-15T09:21:39.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because it's lazy and it just looks like a typo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-15T07:21:33.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or you could do what everyone else does and copy paste.","replies":[{"poster":"iNachozzHD","date":"2015-02-15T08:34:23.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They do?
