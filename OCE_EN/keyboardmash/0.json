After the initial bans i can see the first person choose their champion then after the countdown nothing happens, ive also had games where i enter the lobby and see \"Preparing for battle\" before the bans have even been done so that the whole time (untill my turn to select) nothing happens. Then comes my turn to select a champion and i dont even fucking know when that is cause its all frozen. im assuming that at the end of my turn is when the error pops up saying sent an error report.\r\nHow do i fix this? or am i suppose to play bronze league all the time, forever in normals with bronzies?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-24T03:35:35.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">forever in normals with bronzies?\n\num, people you verse in norms are found by the exact same mechanisms as the ones used in ranked.
