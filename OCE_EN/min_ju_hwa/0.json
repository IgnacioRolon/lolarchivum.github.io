You have to do the heavy lifting yourself. And yes, you will get games that are just simply too hard to lift, and that's ok. Just remember to learn something from every game you play, and don't expect to get compliant team mates every game. You are the only person you can rely on in solo queue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-11-22T23:23:28.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dont you hate it when your bronze and everyone else uses it as an excuse to say everything you do is wrong","replies":[]},{"poster":"nochillgamer","date":"2016-11-22T12:11:21.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And you wonder why you are still Bronze...","replies":[]},{"poster":"xDarkRavenx","date":"2016-11-22T07:08:07.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And you're in the same rank with them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-11-22T01:06:31.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go watch your replays and see what you can do better. Watching your own replay can be boring but always useful since you will see all the mistakes you could have avoided. Watching my replays, I realized that i'm always aggro without always looking at the minimap and that costed me many deaths. Looking at the minimap can help because you can warn your team mates about a gank that is incoming. I did this and saved my team mates many times. Also, keep your chat size to the minimum and mute them and just focus on your own gameplay.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-11-21T23:39:59.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree with u man, i cant flex because reasons with my options of people, dont wanna go into it too much a second time, and with the teammates losing lane, it happens to me EVER GAME, everyone but me loses my lane 80% of ranked game, other 20% about 1 or 2 lose lane and the other equal lane","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-11-21T18:06:49.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to accept that there are going to be times where members of your team are vastly outskilled by the enemy (we have all had games where we are up against someone better than us). \n\n> I am really pissed off and tired to get this kind of match again and again.\n\nIf you play flex queue and queue with some mates (or even some randoms you find on [team recruitment](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment)) you won't have to rely on crossing your fingers and hoping for a better team. **You can control who you play with **and weed out the toxins/crap internet people/unskilled players.","replies":[]}]}
