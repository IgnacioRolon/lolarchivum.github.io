But that being said, DONT play Lee sin.... we really don't need any more of them running around. \n\nStrong adaptable junglers would be along the lines of **Zac, Shyvana, Trundle, Rek'Sai**, and **Vi**. Those ones can be built tank/damage/armour/magic resist, depending on the situation, they all have good clear, and good ganking potential. They all have good map control and are tacky enough for your team to have some flexibility in their picks. _(Unlike picking Kindred or shaco jungle straight up, and then one of your team is forced to go tank even if it stuffs up their lane.)_\n\nChamps like Rammus too are unstoppable against certain team comps, but are basically useless against others. So if you like counter picking, picking Rammus into a full AD team is basically a free win, but you don't want to first pick him, because the enemy can just as easily have too much AP.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-10-05T01:37:56.084+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best 2 roles have always been mid and jungle.\n\nJungle can pressure anywhere and dictate the pace of a game with good ganks/vision etc etc. A great jungler and carry a team to victory.\n\nMid is good because you can roam to both other lanes easily and is also home to some very strong champions.  Again you can impact most the map and help your team out.\n\nADC/Supp is good if you are duo or have comms.","replies":[{"poster":"Sorry For Salt","date":"2016-10-05T05:47:41.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay thanks! who do you think the best junglers/mids are right now?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-10-05T05:56:51.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"jungle\n\ncamp a lane, win a game","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-10-05T06:40:40.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CHEESYLEEKS,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=TYBw47QE,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-10-05T05:56:51.110+0000)\n> \n> camp a lane, win a game\n\nThat sounds like a luring carnies catch phrase","replies":[]}]}]}
