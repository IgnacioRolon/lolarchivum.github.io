Wrong. There is a way, and it&#039;s quite annoying and nearly unfair. Tahm-kench can eat an ally, and save them from camille and her &quot;inescapable&quot; ult. I think the kench is already strong enough making up for the mistakes of team members but now this? Sorry for sounding annoyed but I&#039;d like to know if this was intentional.","replies":[{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2016-12-15T02:59:49.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if kalista ults while on the edge/slightly inside the ult she can also drag her support out as well","replies":[{"poster":"Chign","date":"2016-12-15T03:01:32.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So much for inescapable huh?","replies":[{"poster":"Le Messenger","date":"2016-12-15T15:19:34.401+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She already has incredible durability with a shield passive that scales with health and procs every 20 seconds, a gap closer that stuns, another ability that slows, auto reset on her Q that does percentage health damage after 1.5 second (if I'm remembering correctly) and the ult which locks you in with that insane bi@T$$.  Oh did I mention the ult also makes her untargetable for a second? Screw you ashe arrows, amumu and sej ults.

I just spent 5 minutes skipping through a Camille interaction video on YouTube and I can't help but feel that mains of half the champs in the game at some point might feel that Camille's ult is annoying or unfair. \n\nHaving some counterplay is healthy for the game especially when it requires picking a specific champion who needs to be standing right next to the target to achieve it. There's always a possibility that you hide the Camille pick and they commit to _any_ other top and support champions and don't have that option. \n\nEven if they manage to pick Tahm and he saves the target that means he can't save anyone else (let alone himself) for a decent chunk of the fight. If a fight goes poorly and he is forced to eat a friendly before Camille's ult goes down then that means two champions can be stuck for the price of one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-12-15T06:21:54.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering that Camille is designed to pick targets and prevent their escapes.\nIt's not Tahm fixing an ally's mistake.\n\nYou're not at fault if a Rengar or Camille or Zed or Diana decide to jump on you and make a meal of you.\nMany champions with this style of play can and will go where you are supposedly \"safe\" and make you unsafe.\n\nSo no, Tahm isn't undoing his teammate's mistakes, he's saving his teammates, similar to how you would use QSS to escape Morgana.","replies":[]}]}
