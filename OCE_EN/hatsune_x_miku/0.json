Please wait 24 hours&quot;**\r\n\r\nwhich is quite annoying, the another way is using paypal for them to purchase riot point, which will not block by system, but it makes no profit for us thus it is risking to do that since paypal is linking to our employee&#039;s credit card and there is no two step authorization for better protection.\r\n\r\nSo i was wondering is there a discount for us by purchase multiple(&gt;20) $50 worth of riot point card(or code) ?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n**Jas\r\nMelbourne Sniper Internet Cafe**","replies":[{"poster":"MasterMirkinen","date":"2015-07-14T00:37:44.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Hatsune x Miku,\nping me on twitter so I can give you my email and we take this offline.\nhttps://twitter.com/mastermirkinen","replies":[]}]}
