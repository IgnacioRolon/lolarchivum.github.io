Breaking a double heimer siege was horrible, because the entire aram became trench warfare, where the team that tried to push forward would lose, and minions would get obliterated before they could reach anything, and so the game basically devolved into which team could focus fire and take a pick with a series of ults and then proceed to push a heimerdinger turret back.","replies":[]}]}
