Need solutions","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im having this problem with 6.20 where I have a delay where i don&#039;t get into the actual game until about 45seconds has gone. Also everytime I bring up the scoreboard or whenever I get into team fights my fps drops form 100 to 2 for about 3 seconds. Please help my PC has the required specs and my internet is fine. I have repaired LoL I have also uninstalled and reinstalled the game, also all my PC settings are set to high performance for LoL and the same problem still persist.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-10-19T07:47:24.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThat sounds odd, especially relating to opening your scoreboard.\n\nCould you ensure for me that you have installed all the latest available Windows Updates and that your graphics drivers are up to date.","replies":[{"poster":"Frezah","date":"2016-10-21T01:45:51.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there!\n\nYeah fps drops to 2 or it just freezes for a few seconds before it brings up the board and even if i'm trying to move items to a different box it does the same. I just bought the laptop so i'm unsure whether the drivers are up to date i'm just a newbie. I run windows 10 and its all up to date. \n\nNothings changed with 6.21 so i'm not sure what to do from here.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-10-22T03:28:57.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCheck out [this support article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting#wq1) about updating your GPU drivers.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
