So, I was confused as to why. I asked my friends and they said \"Yeah, cuz nobody plays Gragas.\" Again I was confused. \"Gragas is Swaggas\", I say.\n\nSo here's the point I'm trying to make. Would it be possible/in Riot's best interests to make a Swaggas skin? Like, Gragas, but wearing a snapback that says \"OBEY\", a YOLO shirt, and sunglasses. Honestly, I'd buy that even if it cost 10000 RP. I mean, you made Brolaf, so I don't see why not. \n\nPlease Riot. Make this a thing.
