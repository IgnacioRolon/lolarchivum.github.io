FUDGE it!   I&#039;ve just skin boosted a bot or 3!!!\n\nThe only way I can win with 2 or 3 BOTS! in my team on intermediate Rift bots, for a quick first win the day, is to nerf my build and get a ZZ&#039;Rot Portal  to help maintain the lane integrity...  this is not fun either, but allows me to baby sit lanes stop them from getting pushed to hard.  \n\nBut all to often this will leave the other poor human stuck mid against 5 bots, just wave clearing. While all our bots go haywire around the lanes as the first outer turret fails. . (yes some new player humans do this too, but not with such a common frequency and exact pattern). \n\nOur bots, in a supposed human team, makes level 1&#039;s look good..\n\nYay.. \n\nPolitely.... please fix the continual bot issues my dear Rito, there needs to be a step back, not OH lets make more 1500ip summoner icons, new cool skins or new champs ... just for now... Rito has forgotten the basic&#039;s.. what made this game good in the first place... the GAME PLAY.  \n\nRight now state of game play well, its in total disarray, the exception being PVP Rift and Ranked.  The rest well suck...Bot over load.\n\nSadly OCE I often find my self thinking that wish I hadn&#039;t left NA server, however the promise of free transfer and lower pings and less lag was to delicious to pass bye.\nBut at least on NA even with much 8 - 9X  higher ping at least it was humans... \nAt least my team had a chance!!  \nNot bots feeding bots to then gang up and make it boring.\n\nSorry, to my old fav game ...\nuntil such time, no further funds will be issued from this  &quot;just another number&quot; player, until the game is at least some what more Bot free.\n\nThanks =/","replies":[{"poster":"Vegathron","date":"2016-10-16T21:43:11.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ive NEVER played with a bot. get your mmr out of the gutter so your not matched with them unless there is 0 people quing youd have to be really bad to get matched with them if they lose so hard all the time?","replies":[]},{"poster":"NIghtshadowb","date":"2016-10-16T08:13:06.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Um, get gud scrub???\n(If you are complaining at gragas feeding at a bot game)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-10-16T05:53:49.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"quality post","replies":[]},{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2016-10-16T04:04:18.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Switch servers so you can play with actual people and not with bots -_-","replies":[]}]}
