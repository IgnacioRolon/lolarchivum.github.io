As i was just browsing the skins in the store i noticed Dunk master {{champion:122}} and he looked cool and all but i don&#039;t find the time to save up to get him and the skin. Is it worth it? Should i get it even though i don&#039;t really play Darius that much but have the will to play him for awhile if i get the skin, if you know what i mean. Thanks for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-08-09T11:34:53.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello there I'm a darius main who only plays with the dunkmaster skin and I can tell you both the champ and the skin are definitely WORTH.
