Clubs only partly fill this role, they&#039;re limited to 50 people where chatrooms can have up to 200. It&#039;s hard to meet lots of new people and you already know a lot of the people who are in your club. You&#039;re only able to be in 3 clubs maximum which is still less people than 1 chatroom.\r\n\r\nI know that you guys at Riot value people playing together with friends a great deal, so including the chatrooms such as looking for group in the new client and making it a default chatroom again is definitely something you should consider doing.\r\n\r\nPutting up a list of default chatrooms would be a great thing to get new people to use the new client. The default list could include chatrooms for Looking For Group, one for the players rank, and another one for new players. Another idea I had for chatrooms would be to put in rooms for events that are going on, such as the A-League or another sporting event, to bring people who have the same hobbies together and give them a place to talk about what&#039;s going on.\r\n\r\nNew players can&#039;t find any help in the new client. Putting in a newbie chatroom that has a couple of experienced players who can give them tips and help them out would be a great way of introducing people to the game and helping them to get better and enjoy the early levels.\r\n\r\nPublic chatrooms are a good thing for League of Legends and I hope that Riot intends to put them in at a later date.","replies":[]}
