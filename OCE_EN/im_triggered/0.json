What I'm saying is that sure, those who have made it to Gold in season 4 can get the Victorious skin for free for their hard work, but why not allow it to be up for sale for those who can buy it with RP who haven't made it to gold or for those who just don't feel like playing ranked such as me. I'd also love to know everyone else's opinions on the topic on whether or not Victorious skins should be available for RP.","replies":[{"poster":"vicelore","date":"2014-12-10T01:54:12.397+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morg already has enough good skins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2014-12-09T10:39:35.611+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you don't play ranked then that's your choice, but if you choose not to, then don't whine when you don't get Victorious skins. Victorious skins are designed as something that demonstrates achievement and sportsmanship, while this idea would make a scrubby s4 bronzie like me happy, it completely defeats the purpose of earning it by placing gold and higher, so it's a resounding no from me.","replies":[{"poster":"Im Triggered","date":"2014-12-09T16:14:43.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Those who play ranked and get into gold get it for free.

If you're just going to earn gold and get a skin some people can also buy, what's the point of giving the skin out for free when you can just buy it. Some items are meant to be exclusive and stay that way.
