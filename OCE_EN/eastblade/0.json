Spellvamp has been removed and his e can now even be dodged. Besides that he lacks the utility to actually land hits upon his opponents and the stacks required to get stronger heal and more damage within a teamfight simply is not viable, it takes 12 seconds or less depending on the tf without creeps near. His sustainbility, his DEALABLE damage (damage that you can deal do due being able to reach opponents) are actually brought down. Far more logical would it be for the e to give vlad a speedboost with that he could use his utility to land his nukes and would make far more sense than a slow that only works when the opponent is hit.","replies":[{"poster":"AvK Ðęlµxe ąƒ","date":"2016-05-04T14:19:11.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, as a Vlad main. He's a little bit useless in a team fight... and stealthies can now just move out of the way of his E. I basically get destroyed mid to late. Nice early game though. Thanks for that! Too bad I can't sell all of his skins. I'll keep trying, but so far.\nI'm giving him up for good. I mean... Malz just destroys him at 6 now. Vlad can't do shit. Nice balance guys.","replies":[]}]}
