Im getting so fed up of the bull shit and seeing 0 changes to the game to &quot;blance&quot; it.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-04-02T01:13:14.397+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe this should get taken down, but only because you are wrong in every single point you make.\n\n1. If the game is one sided for you, and you can't bring a game back once someone gets fed, then you're just bad.\n\nThat's it really. The only champions that are OP once people gets snowballing are Anivia, Riven, Darius, Nasus. If you can't beat other champions than that when they get fed... it's a lack of skill by you or your team. Because every champion has their weaknesses, even though some are unbalanced. Even Yi can be easily killed.\n\nI have had heaps of close games these days, and the only games that are one sided is when I'm playing Draven.{{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"WE WUZ KINGZ","date":"2016-04-01T11:52:14.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is only true for ARAM lmao","replies":[]}]}
