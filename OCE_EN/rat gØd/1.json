I have been playing since September of 2014 and only picked up ranked earlier this year. Currently I am looking for a duo partner since I find that my solo queue games are quite inconsistent at the moment without having someone to queue up with. I will play anywhere besides the bottom lane playing predominantly as the assassin/fighter role playing champions such as Talon, Fiora, Nocturne ect. If you are interested in playing with me add a message down below mentioning your rank and where you play. Add me - SilverFlare 20\r\nLooking forward to playing with you","replies":[{"poster":"GPuL Megg","date":"2015-09-10T10:00:21.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"B3 \n\nI main support usually morg or blitz and sometimes play top lane but I am trying to learn jungle.\n\nI'm also finding it hard to solo queue because there are too many afks and trolls","replies":[{"poster":"RAT GØD","date":"2015-09-11T00:06:14.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll add you later today and we can hopefully play some ranked on the weekend {{champion:119}}","replies":[{"poster":"GPuL Megg","date":"2015-09-11T06:49:30.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah man sure, no worries","replies":[]}]}]}]}
