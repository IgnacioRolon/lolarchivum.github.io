So he can start from the bottom. He knows how to play already so he doesn&#039;t want to start a new account from level 1. So I&#039;m wondering whats the quickest way i can drop the account to Bronze 5 without feeding super hard every game and getting reported/hurting my team mates LP? Because i would feel bad if i was dropping peoples LP or making them miss a promo just for this :( \r\n\r\nAny advice or strategies?","replies":[{"poster":"Obama Has Swag","date":"2015-08-10T10:58:35.634+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add me, i can help you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-08-10T07:23:48.810+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Let your brother play from Silver, if he can take it it will remain in silver, if he cant he will drop down naturally to a level in which he can play comfortably without intentionally feeding. \nkeeping him in silver would probably be better for improving his skills too.\n\ni dont think there is another way to drop LP other than afk or intentional feeding, and doing either of those things in ranked on purpose is pretty low.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-08-10T07:21:49.110+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Account sharing is not allowed.

If you queue dodge to lose LP, you can drop 0LP in your current division, then lose a couple to drop one tier/division, however when you queue dodge it doesn't lower your mmr so he could be bronze but still vsing ppl at the mmr you were before. And it's quite a slow way to drop because time penalties after queue dodging.","replies":[]}]}
