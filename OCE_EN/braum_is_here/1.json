I don't think its a hardware problem as i just built this computer and it has some of the higher range specs on it. Its become incredibly annoying when you have a frame rate drop in a team fight or when your being ganked. It doesn't always occur when lots of things are happening on screen either. sometimes just killing minions and it will randomly drop to 10fps, when it normally sits at 60fps. I normally run league of legends on the following video settings:\r\nResolution: 1920x1080\r\nWindowed Mode: Fullscreen\r\nColourBlind Mode: ON\r\nGraphics: Very High\r\nCharacter Inking: ON\r\nFrame Rate Cap: Uncapped\r\nAnti-Aliasing: ON\r\nWait for V-sync: ON\r\n\r\nIve searched the internet looking for solutions but none seem to work for my situation. I suspected at one point its because i have two monitors (both are the same type of monitor) running off the one graphics cards (one on HDMI and the other DVI) but i run MSI afterburner at the same time and the GPU Usage % never gets over 60% or so. This only seems to happen on the new summoners rift, not on ARAM. \r\n\r\nI also play other games that have a lot more intensive graphics such as BF4 and Dragon Age Inquisition at max graphics settings with no issues. \r\n\r\nIf anyone has ideas or a similar problem please help or let us know so we can find a solution. Thanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-26T05:14:04.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually think this has something to do with the game. I've got a pretty good setup as well, with only one monitor, and I'm noticing frame drops at random times just like you. It's annoying to say the least.\n\nI'd hold it out before attempting to do anything about it first. Could just be a patch issue or something stupid.\n\nBut there's one thing I want to clear up first. You say it drops to 10 FPS. That's drastically low. I know that League will go to such frame rates if it believes that it's not in focus on your computer, and you said that you're using two monitors. Could it be that a program on the other monitor is occasionally stealing focus?","replies":[{"poster":"Braum Is Here","date":"2015-02-26T12:25:40.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have actually considered this, i closed all other programs while running league of legends. But still i have the same problem, even when the second monitor is only sitting on the desktop screen.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-28T03:44:15.832+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Clarity: The desktop is considered to be an application in itself, and thus it *is* capable of holding focus. As for any reason why it would automatically do that, I have no clue. All I'm saying is that it's not impossible, just highly improbable.\n\nIt might be with a particular way you've set it up, or it could be your audio drivers running into over-time with the new sound engine. Try playing some games with sound completely disabled and see if you still get the frame drops. Also, try disabling shadows for some games with sound on to see if that fixes it (sometimes the way graphics cards process shadows is just insane).","replies":[{"poster":"Braum Is Here","date":"2015-03-02T07:40:59.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so after reading all this ive tried every solution suggested here and others i found on the internet. \n1. I found that disabling one of the monitors makes no difference to the situation.\n2. Im actually running a EVGA Nvidia GTX970 and adjusting the shadows and all other graphics settings makes little to no difference. I think running MSI afterburner in the background makes it a little better, but that could just be me. MSI afterburner probably makes no difference. \n3. Turning off the sound makes a \"HUGE\" difference, i went from having a frame rate drop every couple of minutes to just one or two per game. This has made the game so much more enjoyable (especially given i normally listen to music while playing anyway). \n\nHopefully this is something that riot will fix in future patches. \n\nQuick question though; if i was to upgrade my sound card would it allow me to play league with sound on? Or wont it make a difference?\nAll my audio drivers are up to date.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-02T09:47:44.857+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What audio drivers do you have? Could you get a copy of the driver's setup?\n\nWhat I'd try is uninstalling the audio drivers and see if Window's generic drivers can provide your audio. That way, if it's the audio drivers causing the issue, then they won't anymore. But, if you don't get sound anymore, you'll have the audio drivers ready to reinstall. You need to make 100% sure that it's your drivers, though.\n\nThat way, you can be more confident in your wish to upgrade your sound card, in that if it proves to be faster when Windows is using its generic drivers, then upgrading will probably bring you net better results.","replies":[{"poster":"Braum Is Here","date":"2015-03-02T14:54:20.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"FINALLY! i have a solution. \nSo i asked a mate who knows a lot more about this stuff than i, and going off what you said he recommended that i disable all my audio drives except the one being use (i had 3 different devices). He suspected that by having multiple audio sound cards overlapping each other were being stressed out and they try and balance the load or something. Im not 100% sure if i explained that correctly but that's how i interpreted it. \n\nAnyway for anyone experiencing this problem and thinks it may be the audio drivers and sound card here is what i did:\n(Im running windows 7)\n1. Open up 'Control Panel', then go 'Hardware and Sound' and under 'Devices and Printers' go \"Device Manager\".\n2. Find the tab labeled \"Sound, video and game controllers\", expand that tab.\n3. Determine which device is being use for the sound on your computer; For me i had 3 devices (NVIDIA High Definition Audio, NVIDIA Virtual Audio Device, and Realtek High Definiton Audio). The one being used was 'NVIDIA High Definition Audio'.\n4. Right click the device not being used and click 'disable' (DO NOT UNINSTALL!). \n5. You may be prompted to restart your computer, if so do it once you've changed all the devices to either enabled or disabled.\n6. Test it on a game of league of legends.\n\nEnjoy and i hope this helps anyone else in the same situation. \nThank you very much 'Horse of Force' for your assistance in this matter.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-03T08:37:57.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh that's entirely possible. Computers are machines, not humans. If you give them three different ways of processing sound when you really only need one, then your computer will use all of them, which can cause problems such as this.\n\nSpeaking of which, I also have the same driver setup as you, and I have some underlying problems with them that I have since given up on trying to fix. I'll attempt this and see if that fixes it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Braum Is Here","date":"2015-03-13T14:30:38.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After patch 5.5 i have this problem again {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Braum Is Here","date":"2015-03-02T14:54:55.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anyway for anyone experiencing this problem and thinks it may be the audio drivers and sound card here is what i did:\n(Im running windows 7)\n1.
