However since the release of dynamic queue i cannot invite anyone from diamond to challenger or even ppl that was the exact same rank as me last season. When being invited it would say you can only play with people within 1 tier from you. This is pretty upsetting as i have to play all my placements myself. Dynamic queue works on my smurf tho.","replies":[{"poster":"Milky","date":"2016-01-21T09:48:24.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same issue, bump.","replies":[]}]}
