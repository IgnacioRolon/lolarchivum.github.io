And I found the most amazing skin concept.\nI think this was made by someone called &#039;LucyL&#039; Riot.. if you make an Ahri legendary skin in the future... this is what you should aim for.\n\nCorrect me if i'm wrong but, i'm pretty sure this is good enough to be Riot games levels of splash/concept art. And Ahri will one day get a legendary skin. I'm almost certain, She most likely won't get it for a long time because Arcade came out last year and she is getting some decent chromas. I guess everyone should just discuss if it's a good skin idea/concept/splash or not.","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-01-30T17:28:18.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So far, every single skin Ahri has, is glaringly bright and colourful. Even foxfire Ahri, her more 'serious' skin is still quite bright and 'cute.'\n\nWhile this does seem like a good piece of work, it also doesn't really bring anything new to Ahri? \n\nPersonally, I don't want her next skin to be skanky and vibrant, I'd like something a little more... Violent?","replies":[{"poster":"Willy Donka","date":"2017-01-31T06:04:00.827+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe soulstealer/dark star Ahri is what you would be thinking of.","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-01-31T06:07:20.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very good ideas!

This has been made into a rather unimpressive custom skin, but the elegance of the design, the balance of the red, green and blue colour scheme, I just want this to be made into an official skin and it'd even fall into the jade warring kingdoms skin set.","replies":[{"poster":"Willy Donka","date":"2017-01-30T12:00:20.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not a big fan of the long nails, but other than that yeah that would be pretty good. still want to have a skin like that has foxfires as foxes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-30T09:54:33.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That doesn't seem like a legendary skin (1820RP), maybe imperial skin (1350RP) or even just your epic skin (975RP).\n\nBut idk.","replies":[{"poster":"Willy Donka","date":"2017-01-30T09:59:06.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that was so fast... but if they modeled the foxfires like that it would be epic/imperial or higher.\nand i call 1350 epic. imperial sounds in-between ultimate and legendary.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-30T10:11:55.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Willy Donka,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=0exNsqmQ,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-01-30T09:59:06.977+0000)\n>\n> that was so fast... but if they modeled the foxfires like that it would be epic/imperial or higher.\n> and i call 1350 epic. imperial sounds in-between ultimate and legendary.\n\nYeah I'm not sure about how the skin tiers are called these days, I was just using what LoLWiki calls them. Hence why I listed the RP cost, because that conveys better.\n\nAccording to Riot's official skin tier differentiation:\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752874-Guide-to-Skin-Price-Tiers\n\n> **1350 RP**\n> Features: new model, new texture, new splash image, new animations, new visual effects, new sounds.\n> Sometimes includes: processed voice overs.\n> Examples: Blackthorn Morgana, Arcade Sona.\n> \n> **1820 RP - Legendary skins**\n> A legendary skin completely changes the look and feel of a champion.\n> Features: new model, new texture, new splash image, new animations, new visuals, new voice over and sounds.\n> Examples: Battlecast Prime Cho'Gath, Brolaf.\n\nSo I suppose unless this skin gets drastically different theme to the champion's original design (which this skin isn't as it's still the Nine Tail Fox, only Japanese themed as opposed to Korean themed) and new voice overs, otherwise it's a 1350RP skin.","replies":[{"poster":"Willy Donka","date":"2017-01-30T10:20:18.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah... I can't imagine what her voice would be with this skin or what she would say. but riot always comes up with something random with voicelines....
