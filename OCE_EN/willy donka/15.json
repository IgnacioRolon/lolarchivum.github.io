Why do you force support players to put a secondary role if you want people to play support? Why give someone that mains mid lane champs support if there is people that main support that want to play support, being placed into mid? I don&#039;t understand. I personally think this is just a stupid system. If you want more supports, remove the requirement for a secondary role as support.","replies":[{"poster":"Corvo Attano","date":"2017-02-04T00:11:45.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're An Idiot.","replies":[{"poster":"Willy Donka","date":"2017-02-04T08:53:38.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you elaborate more on that?","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-02-05T03:17:07.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sometimes you'll set support as your primary and fill as your secondary, and a teammate might set mid as primary and sup as their secondary. Sometimes you'll get mid and they get sup even though you'd both prefer to have the other's role. I mean you can get around this by switching in the champion select, but it's still kinda annoying.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
