To ski[ this i pressed P and the shop opened. The buy button was grayed out for everything like it would be if you were out of range for the shop, I tried double clicking and right clicking the item to avoid this but none of them worked. Later in the game I tried to buy items and I could so long as I was dead. This led to me executing myself every time I needed to buy an item.","replies":[{"poster":"DoctorFoetus","date":"2015-09-30T06:45:33.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"justhowlingabyssthings","replies":[]}]}
