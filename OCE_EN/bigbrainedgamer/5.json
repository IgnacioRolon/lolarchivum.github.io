I usually pick Jungle/Support, but I've picked fill about 10 times (on this and my smurf) and about 4 times I've gotten mid, once bot, once top. So it was only support half the time. The strangest thing is that mid was given so many times. It's supposed to be the most popular role. Maybe people are avoiding it for shorter queue times?\n\nEither way, there's nothing wrong with playing support. I supported my way solo out of Bronze->Gold when I first started the game, and this was when support wasn't as impactful as it is right now (back then support was least impactful, now support is more impactful than ADC or top).","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-02-19T10:53:54.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh no, nothing wrong with support, I'm all for support players. just saying that people are always bitching about them choosing e.g. mid / fill, or just fill, and like 90% they say they get support.","replies":[{"poster":"Strat","date":"2016-02-19T11:45:29.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, well, dunno why they'd bitch if they'd selected fill.
