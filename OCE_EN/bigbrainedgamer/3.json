If you think every loss is on bad team mates, remember, you are the only factor that stays consistent throughout your games and there is absolutely nothing you can do to improve your team mates' play, so blaming and flaming them is futile. All you can improve, is yourself, and when you come to that realisation, improvement will show.","replies":[{"poster":"BigBrainedGamer","date":"2016-01-24T02:28:37.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright sir i will keep that in mind, thank you ^.^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-01-23T16:56:32.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I added you in game","replies":[{"poster":"BigBrainedGamer","date":"2016-01-23T17:00:14.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will accept after this game :D","replies":[]}]}]}
