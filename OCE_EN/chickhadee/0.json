My ping used to be around 30-90 and now LoL is simply unplayable for me and I have no idea why, please help! I use a macbook pro and my ISP is Optus.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-08T09:51:54.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo, have you tried [changing your DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#mq3) yet?","replies":[{"poster":"ChicKhadee","date":"2015-02-08T10:40:50.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was considering doing so, but is it safe?

It's safe to experiment with it, to see if it'll help you at all.","replies":[{"poster":"ChicKhadee","date":"2015-02-12T06:03:29.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, I have changed my DNS and I don't think it made that much of a difference, however, I think I realised that its mainly when other people are using wifi that my ping goes up. When no one else is using the wifi, it usually remains at 30-100ms. So I guess Optus is just a crappy network.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-12T23:07:52.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">So I guess Optus is just a crappy network.\n\nCrappy but *a lot* better than some others out there. I use Optus myself because of it's ideal plan, not for its speed or reliability. Maybe I'll upgrade it in the future. Maybe.\n\nAlso you'd probably be able to set up your own connection to the internet so that when other people use your wifi it won't interrupt your play. One solution is to get a modem just for you, although that wouldn't eliminate purely bandwidth. The best solution is to get your own plan and a separate connection.\n\nBest of luck!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ToxicHawk","date":"2015-02-09T04:07:40.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey ChicKhadee,\n\nAre you still experiencing this issue?\n\nCan you let us know:\n- What Internet provider do you use?\n- What type of internet do you have (ADSL, fiber, wireless, etc)?\n- What city are you in?\n\n\nWe are currently aware of some players in Flip NZ that are experiencing troubles when playing League of Legends and we are gathering data and working with them to try and resolve the issue.\n\nThat being said even if you are not with Flip, we still want you to have the best connection possible when playing so if you could head over to http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/tools/network-logs and run our Network Diagnostic Tool, and send the results and a description of your issues to ocelivereports@riotgames.com.
