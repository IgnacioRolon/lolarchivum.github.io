But wait, you get bonus RP for prepaid cards? I thought that was only for RP ordered using online services.\n\nHow far off are you RP wise?

I'm short 15RP for DJ Sona...I'll just buy another prepaid card at some point.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-15T10:30:22.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably the best thing to do.
