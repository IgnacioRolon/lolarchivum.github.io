Whenever i click to open league and press the launch button on the patcher page nothing happens. The patcher disappears and the login screen doesn't show up, no matter how long i wait. The only way i can log in now is to continuously open league until the login screen finally decides to show up. I can play normally after logging in but i would just like to know if anyone has any solutions to this issue because its a bit of a pain.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-04T06:20:03.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried reinstalling the client?","replies":[]}]}
