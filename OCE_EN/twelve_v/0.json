I stopped playing 2 years ago and gave my account to a friend who got it upto gold 3. I started playing again on the same account and am wondering if there is anyway you can drop me down or reset my ranked stats?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-07-16T03:38:23.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"GIven that account sharing, especially to play ranked, is not allowed and is grounds for a 14 day ban and loss of all ranked rewards, I'd recommend not broadcasting the fact that you have essentially been boosted.
