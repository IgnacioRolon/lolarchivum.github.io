All the accounts have no viewable match history.\r\n\r\n If you add them they send you this message.\r\n\"你好\r\n我是代练的打手,再要代练陪练或拜师请您直接找我哈,价格比较便宜\r\n方便您加个微信吗，mengnandailian 我把我的价目表发给您，如有打扰，请您谅解\"\r\n\r\nI'm not super sure what it means exactly but I've put it through google translate and it seems they're selling boosting services.
