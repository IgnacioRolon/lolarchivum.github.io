It is very unfair that we (or the opposite team) get put behind and just as remake is about to come up the afk returns. I have complained about it in the past also but after a few years of frustration and no change you got nothing left but accept it. The thing is though, this problem is no different to you or anyone in the game having internet issues/lag/fps, if a major bug is encountered during the game or if one of the players in you're game is some pro player on his smurf. Unfortunately these and many other issues are very common but to put in restrictions to rectify them all would be costly and probably change the game to the point that it is unrecognizable. There is only so much Riot can do to ensure a \"fair\" game is represented to all parties. All you can do is accept it and send reports to Riot if it's bad enough but it will not change anything, at least not immediately.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NIghtshadowb","date":"2019-10-10T04:18:52.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure it can be abused (especially for boosters) like say you guys invade and get destroyed at 1:00.
