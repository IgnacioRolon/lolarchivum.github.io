I messaged support and this is what I receive.\r\n\r\n'Now, you didn't insult anyone, you're right about this but you've gotten yourself into an argument and started pointing out the mistakes other made. Why is this negative, well, because the other players in the game got tilted by your comments, the team vibe at this points was an aggressive one. People who just argue don't really focus on the game and in the end the main goal of the game is winning.'\r\n\r\nNow if advising a top laner who is perma pushinghis lane, that has 4 deaths at 5 minutes and wants to flame the jungle for not Ã§amping' his lane. He was being abusive and ended up inting.\r\n\r\n[10:57] Shinobigatana (Sivir): you shoved lane then kayle shoved you under your tower\r\n[14:42] Shinobigatana (Sivir): we arnt the ones crying\r\n[14:58] Shinobigatana (Sivir): how am i harrasing you\r\n[15:06] Shinobigatana (Sivir): you literally being toxic and cant take advice\r\n[15:22] Shinobigatana (Sivir): if you dont want to be 2v12 learn to freeze lane\r\n[15:24] Shinobigatana (Sivir): easy math\r\n[15:29] Shinobigatana (Sivir): he wasnt being toxic\r\n[15:37] Shinobigatana (Sivir): he stated your lane is always pushed\r\n[15:42] Shinobigatana (Sivir): and you threatened to int\r\n[15:45] Shinobigatana (Sivir): thats on you\r\n[16:22] Shinobigatana (Sivir): so are you\r\n[17:01] Shinobigatana (Sivir): no dude you legit perma pushed lane\r\n\r\nThere were 2 other people on my team that were involved in the convo then 1 more, being the person that I was talking about. you can say just mute chat etc. but the game was over the opposing top laner kayle was fed, the enemy jungle camped top lane for the first 5-8 minutes resulting in kayle not needing help and he perma ganked bot lane.","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-11-09T22:22:24.163+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I can see how you're trying to help and I do think it's harsh. I also think it's not a great job of communicating to you what you should or can do to get you're point across. \nWhat I think the rioter might be trying to say in this scenario is one of 2 things: 1. Either don't chat in game as a general rule, or 2. When trying to help and communicate with you're team, tell them what they should be doing and put a positive spin on you're communication. Telling them what they are doing wrong isn't necessarily helpful because it doesn't necessarily leave only 1 option left to do it right. I know you did talk about freezing lane and so forth which is the positive part but leaving out the negative and only being positive might have more of a healthy impact.\n\nThat's just me trying to be critical and pro-active in getting a desired result rather than this. As I said I don't believe you deserve this just based on what I see. Whether there is more to the story or not I cannot know.","replies":[{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2019-11-10T08:28:06.052+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"'Now, you didn't insult anyone, you're right about this but you've gotten yourself into an argument and started pointing out the mistakes other made.
