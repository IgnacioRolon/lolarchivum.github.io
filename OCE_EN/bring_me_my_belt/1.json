I will not take crap from anyone who uses family, drugs etc as a way to insult people, there are people that can not mentally handle those types of comments, and if anyone says anything like that to myself, or anyone else, in game or not, I will say something, purely because people need to see that their are people that actually care about those issues.\r\nI would name and shame these people but it is against the boards which is fortunate for them.\r\n\r\nFirst I would like to address, the amount of people in game that are trolling in game out side the chat box, at least 3-4 people every ranked game I get into are trolling/griefing. Player that try to play the game are bound to have a game were they get tilted, and some of those players will react in the way I did.\r\n\r\nNow when I got chat banned last year, I messaged Riot support and I was told, consistent bad behavior was the reason I was penalized. I was penalized over 1 chat log, that is not consistent bad behavior.\r\n\r\nNow I am not saying I shouldn't be penalized by any means, but stick with me.\r\n\r\nHow is is that players are able to intentionally feed multiple games in a row and nothing happens, yet 1 game that someone looses their cool for what ever reason, WILL get penalized after 1 game.\r\n\r\nThe system in place IS encouraging people to troll games.\r\n\r\nAnd before anyone says anything about the after game pop up only pops up 1/5 times or something like that, These are things that Riot has tools they can change to help prevent this, such as somewhat loosening their grasp on insta penalizing people through the chat box, making a honor requirement to play ranked or even removing the FF button.\r\n\r\nAs I said, I am not saying by any means I do not deserve the chat ban, But im not going to stand there and take crap from a trolling support, and someone who wants to call people crack heads and use family and jokes.\r\n\r\nAnd why the hell in this game did I have a bronze 1 in a s1/s2, like I get its low elo and all but sheesh\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: oldscvhool\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: just chill back\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: i got spell shield ill be fine\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: bruh\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: do ytou know what bliutz does\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: no\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: cause it wasnt hard enough already\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: im afk\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: b\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: raka is actually inting\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: 1 kill down, 4 kills down\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: im literally solo ing bot lane\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: laters\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: i think raka has something wrong\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: she isnt a smurf raka just shouldnt be playing ranked\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: so is bot dw\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: dont gnak loosing  lanes\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: stop walking into every fkn skill shot\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: im dont\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: just\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: raka please dont play ranked you are ruining it for everyone else\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: its not\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: have you lagghed entire game i dont think you have\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: you are versing a blitz and you fucking on the side of the lanes\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: not rage qwuitting some people shouldn't be allowed to play ranked so why help them?\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: raka deserves iron 4 hands down\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: fuiddles dont play with raka\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: nah\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: im done\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: its not a bad game\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: report me for what\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: the raka literally lost lane, jax isnt that great\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: not being negative\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: report me and report raka then\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: sigh\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: better players win\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: not team comp\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: your bronzwe jax\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: sh\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: its a game, you arnt going to play ranked with the intent it supposed to be played, go play norms\r\nAHarmlessCupcake: freelo?

The system isn't fair, it pick on the people that react negative behaviour in chat, not the people that are intentionally inting, or leave the game, hell I had a veigar support who was feeding his tits off, he calls for baron (Bad call, we stayed to long araming mid lane) and because he didn't have his way, he afks in base, and then when he is called out, he goes and farms jungle for the rest of the game. and stuff like this is happening game after game, in rank and in norms.\nNow i don't care about norms so much, but there is little incentive to play ranked after you loose you honor level. it seems like common sense to actually use the honorsystem as a requirement to play ranked","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-04-27T14:09:33.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> This isn't daily life\n\nIf this situation is not comparable to daily life, then please point out all the possible contradictions.\n\n> The system isn't fair, it pick on the people that react negative behavior in chat, not the people that are intentionally inting\n\nThere are flaws, yes, agreed.

Use your head a little and decide if the venture is worth it.\n\nIt isn't comparable to daily life, my situation is that I am reacting to someone that is breaking the rules. convert that to real life. that would be me reacting to someone that is intentionally ruining mine, or someone else experience. if you want to compare it to IRL scenario, I would be verbal reacting to something that is physically causing trouble, the person that is causing physical trouble would have a harsher penalty than the person that stood there running their mouth at them. That is why you can't compare this to IRL because the game cares about the chat log a heck of a lot more than the physical disruptions in the game.\nI played DOtA when it was at its worst and they managed to help tone down the toxic part of the community, including the people that were trolling in game. LoL on the other hand, we do not see improvements on that side of things. Essentially their system is encouraging people to int and troll.\nThis chat log that is above I reacted to people feeding and those same people decided to be abusive to myself and other people in the game, as well as calling people crack heads etc, so it is okay for them to be abusive and troll, and all they may have received is a chat ban. but what about the player that Actually int and troll every game.\n\nIf someone came to me and wants to talk crap and do something physical towards me, id just put them on the ground. and yeah you could complain it's as bad as them, but IRL it is self defense, that person would still be punished harder than what I would, there is another reason you can not compare to IRL","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-04-27T15:44:10.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  my situation is that I am **reacting **to someone that is breaking the rules.\n\nThe problem lie in the way you are reacting. You are doing it all wrong. You know what the rules are, you've signed up for it. Why did you pick the worst possible response, that would land you in the same pit as the guy who is in the wrong? \n\nBecause just like the other player who is grieving out of spite and being short sighted; You are too, acting out your emotional out burst.\n\n>  if you want to compare it to IRL scenario, I would be **verbal reacting** to something that is physically causing trouble, the person that is causing physical trouble would have a harsher penalty than the person that stood there running their mouth at them.\n\nLet be clear here, there is no corporeal contact from either side. You and him are separate in the physical world. The uniting factor is the two of you are in the same VIRTUAL environment; Where emotions speak the loudest. \n\nYou were both doing the same thing. Psychological warfare. \n\n> That is why you can't compare this to IRL because the game cares about the chat log a heck of a lot more than the physical disruptions in the game.\n\nWhat do you mean by physical disruption in game? As in he is in control of your emotions, by leading you into his ploy through game play? If that is what you meant by \"Physical\", then you are not only wrong, you are unbelievably wrong. \n\nAnd to reiterate my earlier post. The coding side of the game where things are computer read, and generating the outcome through an algorithm; It is hard to separate grieving players from bad game plays. \n\nIt take longer for a pattern to appear in the form of reports and consistently **terrible **K.D.A. \n\n>  Essentially their system is encouraging people to int and troll.\n\nRules are there to punish those who goes against it. Most would comply out of being lawful in nature or fearful of the consequences. \n\nThen there are those that don't give a damn about what will happen to them, as long as they can bring pain to the intended victim in that moment. So, how can you stop a person that just DON'T CARE? You cant. They've already decided the hill they will die on.\n\n> This chat log that is above I reacted to people feeding and those same people decided to be abusive to myself and other people in the game, as well as calling people crack heads etc, so it is okay for them to be abusive and troll, and all they may have received is a chat ban. but what about the player that Actually int and troll every game.\n\nAm not saying you shouldn't vent your frustration. AM TELLING YOU SHOULD DO A BETTER JOB AT IT.

Not that you choose self defense. Going outside the law is by no means doing it right. As long as you work within the set of rules and be smart about it, you wont be punish by it.","replies":[{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2019-04-27T17:29:20.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The guy was inting and trolling, before any chat start, the first few of my chat messages, is when he went off chops at me. my point is, I rreacted to someone who was intentionally throwing the game, and this happens everygame (not me losing my cool), and the singular games that I do loose my cool I get punished after one game, the end of last year I intentionally threw 15 games, I screen shotted my match history sent it to sup[port to proove a point, they told me to have a break for the game i wasnt punished","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"PRODIGY4","date":"2019-03-26T09:02:19.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't it time that people start taking responsibility for them selves?
