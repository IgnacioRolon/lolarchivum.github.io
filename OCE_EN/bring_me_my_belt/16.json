I can mute chat but I can&#039;t mute their game play. Yes I get just report them after the game thing and I do, but it doesn&#039;t feel like its doing much.","replies":[{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2019-01-16T02:59:12.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mainly play ADC, I moved to top lane toward the end of the season, 50/50 how weak ADC have become, to avoid tilting a support by asking them to do something, this trolling I have encountered with the 3-4 years I have played this game, whether it is the damage meta that made it worse or not, the last 6-8 months have been my worse experience I have had playing this game, I was in promos for gold 2 where I had my worse game, was also the game that made me stop 'maining' ADC, after that I stopped caring about the game, and Maybe im just getting the bad end of people atm, I try take responsibility for my mistakes, but maybe my mindset of trying to help others handle things better, is something that I shouldn't do","replies":[]},{"poster":"jadelink","date":"2019-01-10T15:34:53.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Played since season 1, on and off.  No more toxic than it has been in the last 5 years or so.  It was worse in the first couple of years, when things werent moderated so much.\n\nPreseason has a bit more trolling and stupidity in ranked, but thats been the case in most preseasons.\n\nThough ARAM does seem more salty now for some reason, maybe the people wanting some chill fun went to the new mode.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Edge Of Tommorow","date":"2019-01-07T05:51:45.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally think that improving your own skill as in csing, trading, roaming and using your lane priority to help out the jungler makes a big difference in the mental state of the other playera in your team. I noticed that youre a top laner so its really easy especially for low elo players to forget to help out their bot lane with good teleport plays. It can feel like a chore to congratulate your teamates on good plays but it definitely makes them feel better and it should make you feel like you have more reliable teammates too. Warding the enemy jungle so that you can tell your teammates that the jungler is bot side and to be careful will reduce the likelyhood that they tilt and start to soft int which they might not be doing intentionally. Gameplay aside i would say that i personally havent noticed an increase in toxicity in fact ive been seeing more and more nice people in my games. Perhaps you are a little tilted yourself so have got into the mindset of blaming your teammates for losing. If you want to climb easily out of low silver consistency is really important and so is csing, map awareness, warding and prioritising objectives over kills. You should feel happier with more wins and seeing an improvement with yourself as a player.","replies":[]}]}
