In the mean time I am going to play something else, this game is to rough right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-10-26T07:00:05.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"just dont get frustrated at a troll because they'll carry on while you get a ban.

Not the issue.\nWhen you go to the doctors. You go there saying \" I am sick \" then he ask random things and you give a yes and no too.\nOnce he has done all this. He can tell you want is wrong with you and offer help.\n\nIssue with this game isn't people being so called \" Toxic \" or negative. It has everything to do with match making / Rank and the fact you need 4 other people.\n\nRank it's self is a hard enough. Wanting to go up. Not climbing. Losing a lot and so on. This makes a player feel like they are trapped. They are better then everyone else and why is Riot matching them with me.\nThen you players that go full tilt because they have loss for 3 days in a row. { I know this one personally } they lose with a 5 KDA for 3 days then they just have had enough and let lose. \n\nThis points to MMR or your personal MMR. Sites like OPGG make people worry about the MMR they have. I know I am one of them. I like to see \" Congratz your MMR is higher then your rank \" then I will lose 2 or 3 games and see my MMR has gone from S3 to S5 and the message is \" Your MMR will coninue to tank if you dont improve \" \nNow when I go into a game I left feeling \" I was SILVER BLOODY 3.. Now my MMR is of Silver 5 and I am matched with these jokers. BLOODY GREAT! \"\n\nWhat most people see and what Riot wants you to do is look at the fact I was toxic. Not look at the fact that it is a symtom of the issue.\nA video from a while a go Riot said \" The longer you are in waiting for a match. The better it is for you \" but then this was proven to be fake. The longer you are waiting for the game. The lower the MMR is needed for you to be placed into a game.\n\nSo EG.. I have MMR of 20. Normally the game will seacrh with in a area of 15 to 25. Longer you wait.. The lower this number be comes. No one is on in the 25 area. So they start to go 10 to 30 and so on. Until a game is made with you in it.\nNow it is 50/50 if you are placed with the 30 MMR or the 10.\n\nSo once this keeps going on and on. Now the player with the MMR of 20. Is now a MMR of 10 and full of rage because he cannot be placed with people of his skill level. In fact when he joins a game. He is placed with people of a lower tier while he is vsing people of his skill level.\n\nSo chat ban to me is pointless. That is like quitting smoking while you smoke the same. It does nothing to stop the issue. The issue must be fix first.","replies":[{"poster":"Nikki","date":"2018-11-06T04:47:25.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While i agree on some points, particularly MMR matching being quite inaccurate, I disagree on most of your other points because a lot of players will smurf in this game(and for some reason Riot allows it, overwatch and CSGO dont.) if the issue is Matchmaking not matching people based on having a similar gameplay/skill level, then Smurfing is dousing that issue in gasoline and lighting it up. Smurfing needs to be dealt with before you can Treat the symptom OR the cause. heck, deal with smurfing while you treat the cause.\n\nthe MMR / Skill system also needs to be dependent on WHAT you do, and HOW you do. Not whether you win or lose. If i go janna and i get S+ Deathless at least 7 assists and i have 2x the entire enemy teams vision score, but I lose. I should NOT lose LP. and if i do, it shouldnt be the usual 20, it should be like 3. Because i wasnt the cause of the team losing, We had plenty of vision, I didnt contribute to the enemy inventory growing in gold, and i clutched a lot of people and saved them. This is the real issue with the Divisional system, I feel. \nAnd if you win, you shouldnt gain much LP if you didnt contribute a lot. (keep in mind, you can die in a teamfight and that contributes to an ace, and then a win. so it isnt just KDA related.) But if you excelled in the game and do so regularly, you should get much more MMR per game. it would also mean smurfs get to their MMR quicker, so we could mostly eliminate \"illegal\" smurfing by just looking at players who Rise exceptionally fast then purposely tank their rating for a week. they become extremely easy to detect.\n\nit takes 5 people to win/lose a game, and if you're a great player hard stuck in bronze you are relying on 80% of your teams to not mess up so you can carry them out. if they feed the Hypercarry or Assassin, you can pretty much kiss your ass goodbye at that point.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nikki","date":"2018-11-06T04:40:12.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, I firmly believe toxic behaviour is present in at least two thirds of the games I play ( OCE server by the way. we're known to be very toxic as a region ) \nAnd that's just on my team, I have all chat permanently muted since my 14 day ban. so there could be even more going on I cant see! \n\nRiot would definitely get brownie points from us if they looked into a more sophisticated system to deal with this oh so painfully common issue in their game.\nSeems like a great time to deal with it too, since that article recently came out about Sexism and bro culture at riot games in the workplace. They can deal with it within the company and the game at the same time. a Detox if you will.\n\n\nmy suggestions are: \nwhen somebody says something negative, say something positive, encouraging \"Good job Lee\" \"Nice double kill\" just be careful that they dont take this as sarcastic cause itll turn them more toxic.\n\nWhen somebody says something negative, mute them. i know this is the obvious solution but it seems a bit silly that we need to /mute all in nearly every game just to play peacefully.\n\nNot replying is another good way to deal with it, bullies will thrive on you giving a response. they get excited when they see you replying because it's social engagement and they are very lonely and jealous of you and what you have. it can be tempting to not leash that master yi that just called you a \"fucking useless female\" but honestly just do your part and support the toxic player by leashing, roaming with them anyway. it'll make you look good in the eyes of your other teammates.\n\nyou can drag your chat bar down to the bottom left of the screen, where you cannot see any chat. the thing i hate about this solution is that you cant see \"x has slain dragon / Baron\" and how long ago pings went out which puts you at a disadvantage so it definitely benefits you more to just be silent i think. mute all doesnt have this issue.\n\nTyping out your harmful message, and then quickly hitting escape to delete it can be a good way to \"Write it on paper, and burn the paper\" so to speak ingame. it works for some people but not all. \n\nSome players set CS goals, objective goals within the game so that they can improve \"Im going to get at least 115 vision score this game\" this methodology can be applied to chat too. See how many games you can go without responding to a flamer or a troll, commend yourself if you go on a streak of not feeding the trolls, eventually this will just become second nature, and the issue will mostly fizzle out when trolls see you as a poor target since you dont respond. \nif you do have to respond, keep the response focused on the game, what they did wrong or how you couldve handled a situation better \"Sorry lee, I couldve come sooner\" \"my bad, I should have re-warded that bush\" Criticising other players is always an option but unless you're friends people dont tend to take it well even when it is written politely. Criticism in your response is ALWAYS preferable to flaming though. \"Morgana, warding this bush can prevent kayn from sneaking behind your wall undetected\" as opposed to \"Wtf, this morg doesnt even know how to ward dragon pit lmfao bronze trash\" or whatever it is we say when we're mad.\n\nHope some of this helps if any! <3","replies":[]}]}
