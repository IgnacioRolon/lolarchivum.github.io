I see less toxic chat than what I do of people playing in such a way that is going to negatively impact games.\r\nRiot Support can not give any advice on how to deal with such issues, all they say is to have a break which I do, I have been playing Anthem and DBD. I come back and have 1 game, 6 people in the same lobby, of ranked soloQ just int and grief. \r\nCan someone tell me what I am supposed to do to deal with it. Reporting isn't doing enough, muting players is pointless because its not the chat log. \r\nI have played league for 4 years, and this game is in a very terrible spot from what I am witnessing, and from my POV, Riot just care too much about the money now.","replies":[{"poster":"Ms Cougar","date":"2019-03-01T03:30:29.344+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Accept that it's mostly a crapshoot for trolls/smurfs.
