Two wrongs don&#039;t make a right but just remember this part. I was banned for say 3 different variations of F***.  in one game.\r\n\r\nI think this year has been stupidly toxic out side team/all chat, and people could say they are having a bad game, I&#039;ve played DotA since RoC days, I&#039;d say I have a decent understand between a player having a bad game, and a player intentionally throwing a game. Most of my games have been players that will sit back and watch  team fights, players that start winging because someone is trying to advise someone else. I would say about 90% of my games I have had is players that are not having a bad game, but actually throwing games intentionally. \r\n\r\nThe game that got me chat banned was a Alistair support, as soon as we spawned in he ran straight to bot lane tower and just walked around it in circles for about 5 minutes, then the player abused me. now this is what gets me, when I sent in a ticket to support I asked them how I should&#039;ve handled the situation, instead they broke down my chat log and commented on how my chat log could have had a negative impact. No consideration was taking into account with the Ali when he abused me, told me to go kill myself.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the current penalty system needs some sort of update, I understand that outside chat log this could be difficult for the current system to pick things up. But I think I can confidently say that this behavior of people being toxic outside of the chat box is becoming a regular occurrence. I don&#039;t have a answer to solve it, but I think doing something like not allowing people that have been buzzed for whatever reason to be unable to play the ranked playlists, would be a good start. \r\n\r\nThis year for me personally, I will say that this is the most toxic game I have played this year, I flared up once and I get chat banned. It&#039;s actually so frustrating when I&#039;m witnessing behavior outside of chat that is more influential on the out come of the game. \r\n\r\nSide note- I won&#039;t call out the person from support who I had a tense conversation with, however,I think support staff need to be more careful with how they reply to tickets.","replies":[{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-10-15T09:25:20.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you tell us what Support said? If they are representing riot you should make it public. \nI don't think it's the most toxic game by the way, Fortnite/PUBG and any game with voice chat is pretty bad when it comes to racism and other common stuff but really no one cares. NO ONE. League is toxic because of the game play and how much one person can impact your experience in a game. Where as other games, It's hard to troll someone specifically. League you can tax their farm, follow them around take their xp feed their lane etc etc. But if they don't use the chat feature, guess what? No detection of a problem in the game. You abuse the person trolling you?

Like do something like the CSGO thing where you watch highlights of someone that was report for cheating or something. But when A support staff says I got penalized because of consistent bad behavior, when I was notified, the only chat log displayed was that game. \n\nThis below was a summary of after 'breaking down' my chat log from that game\n-trying to defuse the situation\n-admit that someone can have a bad game\n-if that doesn't work, mute + report\n-trying to farm and catch-up.\nNow here the thing 2 other people commented on his actions in chat log before I said anything at the 4-5 minute mark, surely support would have access to that, It was not a bad game it was the player intentionally throwing the game, muting would not have done anything at 6-7 minutes I had multiple deaths getting 3 manned tower dived while Ali stood and watch\nI couldn't farm because I  wasn't safe at my tower obviously and I describe what happened in detail earlier in the ticket\nThen the same staff later posted this. 'Intentionally feeding is different from feeding. I really doubt that you had 200 consecutive games with intentionally feeders in your team. Players feeding? Yes. Intentionally? No.' I did not say of intentionally feeding I said almost 200 games of toxic games. Earlier in that support\n\n'Toxicity is a wide term and you have the necessary weapons to defend yourself from it. You can mute the players that are flaming you and you can report them after.' I agree its a wide term in the game but the only tools provided is muting chat. reporting people after game just feels pointless. I still do it, What motivation does someone have to play ranked with some intent of taking it seriously so to speak? a honor system? get penalized once its takes a few months to get it back, so in my mind they need something more like what they have in DotA where you cant play ranked, and you have to play a few low priority queues. And after the changes that has happened this year, I could understand that contributing but i feel like its slowly got worse over the years and it's just led up to this.","replies":[{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-10-15T12:41:29.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A bit hard to understand what support said because it's not broken down enough.

It's always like that. People know when they perform poorly, yelling at them won't do. You blame the support for not having lane control (which might be true though), but blaming is considered a sign of negativity. Instead of saying that, you could explain in a nice or neutral manner what she/he is doing wrong.\n\nI would have said \"please try to apply some lane pressure, I can't farm\" or \"it's okay, let's wait for our jungler, let them push\".\n\n[7:36] Kai'Sa: im afvk\n[8:13] [All] Kai'Sa: im trolling?\n[8:17] [All] Kai'Sa: you wwant 6to go trhere\n[9:09] Kai'Sa: he uuses skills on minions have fun\n[9:40] Kai'Sa: nah imma farm up\n[10:26] Kai'Sa: ping me again\n[10:28] Kai'Sa: i dare you\n[10:45] Kai'Sa: ping me one more time ali\n[10:48] Kai'Sa: i fucking dare you\n[11:31] [All] Kai'Sa: how am im being toxic?\n\nHere you were already angry and while I can understand why, I can't understand the reaction.

I wont deny that I was toxic, but this quote, 'We know there are bad games and people can have bad days. However, exhibiting a toxic behavior constantly will be followed by a punishment - how it was in your case.' does that not put the idea out there that it is for more than just one game of toxic behavior? regardless of the degree of anything that is negative behavior in game?\n\nI'd also like to point out this quote from my ticket as well'. 'It's not okay to behave like that in a game and the chat restriction was a warning'. If its a warning then why do I still get punish more than just a chat ban? I still lost my honor level that took me 3-4 months to get 1 check point off level 2, so I loose my end of season rewards? because of a 'warning'.

Just like murdering someone, it's not like talking smack to someone with kindergarten insults which in the end.. still warrants the worst possible punishment. You move up the punishments tiers too fast, like.. the current system doesn't read how severe, it's just told \"valid\" or \"invalid\" and you move up a tier.\n\nMaybe you should suggest having a demerit point system. I think i like it. atm it seems like we have 12 points and saying your bad twice in chat takes 4 points...  where it should be like 1..... ? You'll probably say it pretty much is already in place but as i said, you move up the tiers too fast for minor stuff. It needs to be able to detect what is severe and what isn't.

The record is something like 13000 games. They didn't work.

Or, you can save those up to 900 players the negativity. It's worth noting that from everything I've read the reform rate at this point is much lower than 1%, this was only an example.\n\nYou get 4 demerit points on your license, because noone should need 5 chances to get their shit together, and if they're at that point, they likely aren't going to.

I'm not saying that makes starting shit ok, but stopping to their level to what, get back at them? I don't think that's ok either.\n\nLess than 1% of players will ever see a punishment, and of those about 75% will never see a second one. Reform rates plummet after that, so there isn't much value at all in having any more than 4 chances.\n\nEven if you don't agree with all the community rules, you have to accept that to be a part of the community they govern you will have to abide by them.\n\nIt sounds like you're largely talking about gameplay offences though, and I'm the first to admit they take too long.

I got angry one game and snapped, I get chat banned.  \n\nWith the way that the honor system is and how lenient negative in game actions are compared to the in game chat log. I can understand why ranked games feel so toxic.  And I honestly do believe that they need to start putting on restrictions to the ranked playlist based on negative behavior. But don't call chat ban a warning and reset honor progress, when the chat log is the easiest thing for the system to pick stuff up, and in game mechanics from negative players is alot easier to get away with.\n\nif the chat dialog was allowed a bit more breathing room, I think it would reduce the in game behavior a little bit  I just think that negative in game behavior is ALOT greater than people spamming the chat box.

Gets tilted, understands that text chat will most likely punish them, decides to troll in game instead. that is the easiest way I can process what I am getting into game after game. im playing in low silvers now because I've deranked, so I may as well play with a few mates, and there is less trolling in game, and I think there is less verbal too","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-21T09:25:28.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The looming end of the ranked season tends to create an environment more likely to trigger toxicity it's true. \n\nStakes are higher so those players who perceive their teams as bad (whether they are or not) and go off at them are more likely to do so, and everyone is generally taking things more seriously and are more liable to frustration when things go wrong.\n\nThere are more people in ranked, which usually results in better matchmaking, but given there are also more people playing who don't play ranked often and may have dropped or increased their skill since means that some games can be a little wonky.\n\nBUT, that doesn't excuse that negative behaviour at all. It's not that gameplay punishments are lenient, it's that they're too slow. The system has to be confident that a player is actually intent feeding before it punishes, and isn't just bad, this is especially true in lower tiers where scores are often very polarised.\n\nAs I understand Riot tested with ranked restrictions prior to the introduction of the IFS and they weren't really effective at all at reducing toxicity, and in fact often had the opposite effect just shunted into normal games, so sticking with chat restricts and temp bans was the better option for reform and prevention.\n\n>when the chat log is the easiest thing for the system to pick stuff up, and in game mechanics from negative players is alot easier to get away with.\n\nSo if I understand correctly, you are saying essentially that because theft is easier to get away with than hurling abuse at the cashier, we shouldn't punish the verbal? IMO it's not that chat is punished too harshly (it's really quite lenient from everything I've seen) but that gameplay punishments aren't where they should be, and I don't believe we should be ignoring or reducing chat punishments because of that.\n\nThe shortcomings of one system should not hinder the effectiveness of another if they don't have to.\n\n>if the chat dialog was allowed a bit more breathing room, I think it would reduce the in game behavior a little bit\n\nHow would this work in your mind? Give people more room to abuse and/or threaten and/or troll players and things will be less toxic? Reactionary negativity has the same effect on the rest of your team as if you started it. \n\nThe vast majority of players never receive a punishment, and of those that do, the vast majority never receive a second.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-10-19T09:47:40.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=RHJXR413,comment-id=000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-10-18T11:49:05.901+0000)\n>\n> What is the difference between an intentional feeder and a genuinely new or bad player?
