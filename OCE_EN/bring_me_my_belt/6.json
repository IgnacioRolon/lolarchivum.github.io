If people don't leave base or dc for a curtain length of time at the start of the game, shouldn't we be able to FF?? Unless a player does not connect to the game it is the only time we can remake. connects to game insta dc's never joins back the rest of the team are forced to play it out and get punished","replies":[{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2019-08-17T04:52:52.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://gyazo.com/17b18501f316e99826ce0b312be36065\n\nconnects for 2 seconds disconnects, unable to remake, when he comes back 5 minutes laters he just runs it down mid and spam pings people.

I dont think there should be any reason if someone is in the fountain for a curtain length before the surrender timers start, that players can start a remake","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-08-16T05:20:36.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"can we also have a change so that if a player returns after like 3min, and still manages to win lane and carry, that they still get Lp?\n\nIt's so frustrating to have the client crash on loadin, and then work your ass off to claw back the game to a lane a lvl down on your opponent, you finally pull back the game, you carry. You're fighting for 37/40min for the game, and at the end game screen, you get 4 honours and 0Lp.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-08-11T00:24:17.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"liar pants?\n","replies":[]}]}
