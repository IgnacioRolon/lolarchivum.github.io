While Kr and NA send updates to their communities. Oce's low size makes us an underdog to the rest of the region. I like watching upsets so when an oce team gets to go to an international event, that's when it a time to care. Oce may be small, but not talentless, like DIRE wolves, who's players all bootcamped in Korea and reached challenger, especially shernfire who impressively peaked at rank 4 in korea","replies":[]},{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2018-03-21T04:57:29.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey not being salty here or toxic but technically they were in the 'play in' stage.","replies":[]}]}
