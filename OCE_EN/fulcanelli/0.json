I'm not claiming to be great. I play fairly casually, I actually like some of the changes a lot.

You can have 3 turrets up and somebody can walk in on you, hit you with a sword and the pets won't stop shooting that super minion. Everything else is fine. \n\nI acknowledge Heimer might have been too much against melee champs, but right now, those super mobile melee champs, who happen to be really good at evading grenades and other slow moving projectiles need not fear the turrets. Extra mobility doesn't protect you against that.\n\nIt's pretty sad using your Zhonya in the middle of your turrets, only to kill a super minion and die anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-05-17T09:22:17.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trashing one of the most frustrating champs to lane against?
