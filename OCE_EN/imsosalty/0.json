Someone from riot?","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Recently after the patch 6.16 came out I wasn&#039;t able to login into the game. After the client loaded up and I pressed Launch it would just disappear and the login screen would not appear not matter how many times I re-opened the client. I have since followed some of your tips by deleting files and restarting league to force a repatch which worked. But now my problem is every time I press Play and get into champ select and once the champ select is finished the client or whatever closes to open the loading screen and now the loading screen will not show up. I have re-logged and tried to connect multiple times and I&#039;ve even done a repair and nothing has changed.
