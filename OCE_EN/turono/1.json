I was also expecting there to at least be something on the main screen of the client about it. If I were in charge of making people more aware of the OPL I would make sure that each day the main story on the client is about the OPL. I know this is already done but I think the article gets changed to the OPL one too late in the day, it needs to be put on as soon as the clock ticks over to an OPL day.\r\n\r\nJust my two cents","replies":[{"poster":"CptStupendous","date":"2016-01-18T04:49:32.802+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've had some issues getting the website updated but it's all sorted now, although there are a few bugs we're still working on. \n\nTo be honest you are right, this was sloppy and I take full responsibility. You all deserve better than having a schedule deployed 3 hours before the season starts. Not good enough of our part. There's no excuse.","replies":[{"poster":"Codux","date":"2016-01-18T06:18:50.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In other news is there going to be a post on how the OOL will work this season?
