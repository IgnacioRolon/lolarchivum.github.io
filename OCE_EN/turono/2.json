I&#039;d say it would increase viewership by a fair amount so I see no reason to not do it.\r\n\r\nFor example, I don&#039;t see why Riot would spend money making that awesome hype video for Legacy vs Chiefs and not post it on the Facebook page.\r\nThe only reason I can see them not making posts about it is that they&#039;re worried about flooding people&#039;s timelines with LOL, but I don&#039;t really have a problem with that and I imagine others wouldn&#039;t either.","replies":[{"poster":"littlemisscheeky","date":"2016-03-14T07:03:01.291+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Turono,\n\nIn the past we have posted a significant amount of eSports and OPL content on the LOL Oceania Facebook page, as we too thought it would be of interest to the LOL fans. \n\nBut when we looked at the response from the fans (their engagement via likes, comments and shares) from the variety of eSports content posted, it consistently did poorly in engagement compared to pure league of legends content, as well as creative content such as fan art and cosplay. So even though the content appeals to fans like yourself, it didn't interest the majority of fans of the page :( Which also has ramifications related to Facebook's timeline algorithm; Edgerank. \n\nWe have looked at creating a separate Facebook page just for eSports and OPL content, and this could be a potential solution for fans like yourself that wish to receive OPL content via Facebook.\n\nFor the moment, our focus has been on Twitter and integrating live social media engagement into the OPL broadcast, as well as supporting the OPL teams with their social accounts.","replies":[{"poster":"LordCreep","date":"2016-03-16T23:11:35.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"spewing == i dont use twitter at all ever lol","replies":[{"poster":"littlemisscheeky","date":"2016-03-17T01:15:12.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely recommend getting on it if you're interested in participating in the live engagement from the OPL broadcast etc. \n\nAnd if you'd like to know what the Twitter handles are of the teams, players, casters etc. so you can follow them, check out the Twitter lists I've set up :) https://twitter.com/LOL_Oceania/lists","replies":[]}]}]}]}
