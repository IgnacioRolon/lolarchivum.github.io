MR Ducky hasn&#039;t left a game in a very long time and he does it in URF, because of the one sided  game play just like in ARAM. I wish I could enjoy this game mode but you really can&#039;t enjoy getting face rolled by Orianna {{champion:61}}  when you are Illaoi {{champion:420}} , says Mr Ducky. MR Ducky would be fine with it if it wasn&#039;t Summoner Rift but instead it was The Howling Abyss.  Mr Ducky will still play League, he enjoys it ^.^ but he will only be playing ARAM because honestly, its more fun than AR URF.
