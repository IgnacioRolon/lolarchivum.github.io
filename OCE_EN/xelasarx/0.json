It's so frustrating to take one for the team and leave matchmaking and w8 and take punishment for other peoples bad behaviour.\r\n\r\nSo a Vote 4 man need to vote YES to kick someone from matchmaking? would that be too easy to abuse?","replies":[{"poster":"Daymon","date":"2019-06-14T12:52:01.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"just tax their cs if they are bad anyway its better on, its for the utilitarian greater good of the games outcome (you winning) and then dont play with them again if ur that upset\n\nyou dont need to vote you can just leave no one has a gun to your head and even if they did, nothing is gauranteed","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-06-15T02:37:45.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"just tax their cs if they are bad anyway its better on\"\nNow you're just encouraging trolls to troll\n\n\"then dont play with them again if ur that upset\"\nthats.........thats now how LoL works dude.\nyou know you get match made with randoms right?\n\n\nright?","replies":[]}]}]}
