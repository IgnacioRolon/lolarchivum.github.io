You're still making progress on your honour level, but it is slow.\n\nYou tend to regularly have games where you'll spin up an argument with other members of your team (or the opposing team) and keep them going until the end of the game. Calling people names and telling them to \"fuck up\" is also not helping.\n\nYou get reported a lot (not in the top percentile or anything, but way above average). Looking at those reports your teammates regularly reckon you're holding the team back, talking about things like \"wasting everyone's time, negative and giving up attitude, abusive swearing, abusing the opposing team\", stuff like that.\nYou've not been penalized for any of this yet, but it is slowing down your honour progression.\n\nMy advice would be to stop making excuses or complaining about the game in chat and getting into arguments. You just gotta show up and play.\nYou can communicate with other people, and yeah sometimes they'll take it the wrong way - such is text chat. But when they do, firing back at them is not what most people do. The person with a high honour rating will be the person who, when that happens, they just shrug it off, mute, play the game out, and report if they feel it's justified. Totally neutral behaviour, nothing overly positive required.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-04-26T00:02:15.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just curious, at what honour level checkpoint is OCE's most honourable player atm?","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2018-04-28T04:37:44.654+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually not sure, I don't really have a way to find out either.
