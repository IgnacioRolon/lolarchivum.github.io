His garb, completely covering all but his blue eyes in a deep purple, helps him to hide within the shadows.  He rolls a shuriken across his fingers as he scans the forest floor in search of his prey. He breathes deeply, yet silently, as he focuses. A soft breeze blows by, carrying with it the unmistakeable sound of leaves crumpling underfoot. &ldquo;Aha&rdquo;, Kennen thinks to himself, &ldquo;try as you might, you cannot remain hidden from me for long.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n          Kennen drifts from branch to branch as a leaf on the wind. Careful to not disturb the tree&rsquo;s limbs more than the breeze, he closes in on his target. He spies a spot of black on the grass and dirt for just a moment. Almost in position. The breeze chiming through the leaves monetarily becomes a gust, shaking the branch he&rsquo;s perched on. He closes his eyes and holds his breath. As the wind passes, he looks below. His target stands in a clearing with eyes closed, her black hair settling once more on her back. Now is the time to strike!\r\n\r\n          Kennen raises his hand, a shuriken held between his index and middle fingers. He whispers under his breath &ldquo;feel the justice of the Kinkou Order&rdquo; and flicks the sharp metal straight for his target. The woman takes a single step backwards, letting the shuriken glide within fractions of an inch from her face. As the shuriken lodges into the ground beside her, she looks into the trees, straight into Kennen&rsquo;s eyes. Even through her green mask, he can feel that smug smile of hers. &ldquo;Tch!&rdquo; Seemingly as fast as lightning, Kennen moves from branch to branch, throwing a shuriken each time. Each time, Akali simply takes one step to dodge, not even looking at where the projectile launches from. He holds his fifth shuriken in his hand, and releases some of his limitless energy into it before tossing. With one more of Akali&rsquo;s steps, this shuriken lands in the tree behind her.\r\n\r\n          &ldquo;Is that the best you&rsquo;ve got, Kennen? I thought you were supposed to be our Courser of the Sun.&rdquo; The tone reminds Kennen of her attitude towards weak targets: patronizing and totally self-sure. He has no need to respond, however, as Akali too hears the crackling behind her. The electric energy of the shuriken arcs towards the stars lodged in the ground, which in turn arc to the remaining stars, forming a pentagon of lightning. Akali deftly leaps out of the lightning almost too late as the energy from the five metal weapons meets in the centre and explodes in a cascade of electricity. She looks to where the fifth shuriken came from, only to find the tree infuriatingly yordle-free. She sighs. &ldquo;I see you learned a new trick. It&rsquo;s good for catching opponents unawares, but that won&rsquo;t happen again.&rdquo; Kennen took this as a compliment, but remains out of view. Akali silently draws her kamas and holds them defensively.\r\n\r\n          Akali hears the sound of metal digging into dirt behind her and swiftly turns around to investigate. Immediately after, she feels an intense heat and shock course through her whole body as a bolt of ball lightning travels through her back and appears in front of her. A thundering shuriken flies out of the bolt and scrapes her arm, sending more shocks through her system. She hurriedly takes a smoke bomb from her pouch as the lightning before her takes the form of a yordle once more, and tosses it at her feet. Purple smoke covers the area around her Kennen&rsquo;s eyes glow white as lightning spews forth from his hands, arcing into the cloud of smoke. All of Akali&rsquo;s nerves seem to stop working, like they&rsquo;ve been overloaded and need to restart before she can move again. She grits her teeth and grips her kamas tightly, but she&rsquo;s not sure if it&rsquo;s from the electricity running through her or from sheer frustration at having fallen for such an obvious trick.\r\n\r\n          Kennen charges another of his shurikens with his boundless energy and throws it into the heart of the smoke. Seeing it fly up and out of the top of the cloud was not what he expected. Metal on metal could be heard from within, so he could only assume that Akali had blocked it with her kama. The breeze picks up into a gust once more, lifting dirt into Kennen&rsquo;s face. He covers his eyes until the gust passes. The wind had also blown the purple smoke away, but the green-clad ninja was nowhere to be seen.\r\n\r\n          &ldquo;That was quite impressive, Kennen. I let my guard down, and you capitalized on it spectacularly. However, it is now my turn.&rdquo;\r\n          The yordle ninja arms himself with a couple of large kunai, one in each hand. &ldquo;Akali could be behind any of these trees&rdquo; he muses to himself, allowing his gaze to drift slowly across the trees. His ears listen for even the slightest sound. Even the most silent and disciplined of his order struggle to stay out of earshot of Kennen. He hears the sound of a blade cut through the breeze and immediately turns to face it while bringing his kunai up to his face.\r\n\r\n          The kama that had flown towards Kennen bounces off his blades and sticks into the ground. In his defensive stance, he struggles to see the dark blur race towards him, but feels the pressure of a blow against his kunai. His opponent seems to only be the wind, as no-one and nothing is in front of him. A blade in his shoulder quickly reminds him of his adversary, however, and he turns to see Akali standing immediately behind him, right on his shadow. She&rsquo;s holding both kamas once more, having picked up the one she threw during her Shadow Dance. Before Kennen can react, Akali pirouettes, her kamas slicing in a beautifully deadly circle around her. Although he manages to parry the blow, the sheer force of it knocks him off of his feet.\r\n\r\n          Even before he hits the ground, Kennen can feel a breeze on his mouth &ndash; Akali had sliced off his mask in another Dance. He deflects yet another blow from Akali, despite lying on his back. He growls as his eyes grow white once more. He jumps to his feet, kunai still in hand, and lets out a roar as the very air around him electrifies. The grass singes as Kennen charges his opponent. Although Akali tried her best to escape the Maelstrom, outrunning the Heart of the Tempest is a difficult feat at the best of times, and she quickly finds herself struck by lightning from the heavens. As the static field around Kennen dissipates, he leaps onto Akali&rsquo;s back with kunai in hand, prepared to deliver the final blow.\r\n\r\n          &ldquo;Enough.&rdquo; \r\n          The voice echoes through the forest. It&rsquo;s calm and yet completely authoritative. &ldquo;Your training for today has concluded. The winner of this sparring match is Akali. Had this been a true battle, you would be missing more than your mask, Kennen. It was, however, a marvel to behold. You both bring pride and honour to the Order.&rdquo; Shen steps out of the shadows with his hands behind his back and impeccable posture. Kennen quickly climbs off of Akali and helps her stand up. They face each other and bow deeply, a symbol of their strong respect for one another. Shen brings his hands to his front, revealing a couple of bandages. &ldquo;Allow me to treat your wounds. As members of the Order of Balance, we must be at peak condition, lest those who would destroy that balance be allowed to wander Runeterra too long.&rdquo;","replies":[{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T22:03:55.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I personally don't have a problem with it, this story is in large a single action piece, and some people may find that just a little boring to read. It may be wise to inject more character insight into your stories to break up the unrelenting action, or cut down on the fight. But it's not badly written. Clear and intense. I enjoyed it :)","replies":[]}]}
