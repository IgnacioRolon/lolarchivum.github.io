The community itself is basically a bunch of flamers screaming at others over their own mistakes, which makes everyone feel worse and as a result play worse. I try to play with friends.... it doesn't get much better there. Idek, I used to love this game, played it everyday from season 2 , I tried to get to gold, silver 1 close :P, I didn't make it but I was still satisfied. It's just kinda hard to let go of a game you've played for years.\r\nI'm probably going to get so much downvote for this, but I don't think I can return until the game improves","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-03-21T14:58:52.503+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why are you bothering to be nice?
