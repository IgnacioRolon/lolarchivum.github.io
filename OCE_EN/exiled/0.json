Putting nerfs on her will reduce her viability in lanes. She doesn&#039;t need to be nerfed at all imo. Her ult is already dodged with spells/dashes{{champion:67}} &lt;-- I HATE THIS BTCH, so reducing the speed by such a percent is just not right. She can be beaten by a heap of top laners unless she plays right, and nerfing her without balancing out other top laners is crazy. If {{item:3071}} is the reason of the Riven nerf, I can tell you that it is not a needed item on her. The bonus health and increased CDR aren&#039;t useful. PLZ RIOT I BEG YOU.

Nothing else should be done to her. A champ that is not 'as good' in the current meta gives more reason to be left alone. Why out of all champs does Riot choose to nerf Riven. I agree solely with this post that Riven shouldn't be nerfed.  There's other champs like Cho'gath that should be nerfed. He is the prime example of OP atm. Insane burst if building full ap, and his ult stacks make him nearly unkillable if he has roa and some other tank items. And what about boxbox and brna, what happens to them... Any nerfs on their main champ will make them fair less against stronger champs. Renekton being one of the worst champs in this case, he can just e out of Riven's ult. Not only will it be easier to dodge, it will also give time for champs such as rene and nasus to use their ults to survive the brink of death.

The ult nerf is just soo bs, people are going to be able to sidestep it at this rate.
