Lather them with compliments, say how good they are in game and give them anything they want. Sooner or later they hopefully should turn around and in the least case, in their eyes you will look good so they will be nice to you. We all deal with the problem of trolls and toxic players in different ways and they all vary on effectiveness. I find this method works for me and only a handful of occasions where it hasn't worked. It may be tempting to just dodge them but the Leaver-buster system doesn't take into account if there is a troll in the lobby because there is no function of it where it can understand what the chat says. It just sees that you leave and then issues a punishment. It's just an algorithm.\n\nHope this helps you to try and manage the trolls and toxic players.","replies":[]}]}
