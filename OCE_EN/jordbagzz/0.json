HELP ME","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, I&#039;ve been trying to main Gangplank for a while now ever since I saw a video of Gangplank insta killing a full HP Vayne with a single Q, and now he has a rework coming and it looks like he might finally be balanced with his new E. I really like him, but I have not yet carried a game with him, most of the time I feed or lose lane and I&#039;m quite sure its because of how passive I am with Gangplank. I start off with {{item:2041}} 1 {{item:2003}}  and 2 {{item:2004}} and just farm with my Q (Parrrley). I never engage or harass unless my team is heading top for a gank even though about 95% of the time, the enemy top laner focuses on me more than farming. The reason I do this is because I think Q farming will benefit me more than just harassing and trying to win lane. Whats your guys opinions on this?","replies":[{"poster":"RUSTYtheCASTER","date":"2015-07-11T12:54:08.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Q is used as required, there are two ways to play it, veigar-esque in your manner.\nYou can commit to harrass and have a decent laning phase, or commit to farm and have a passive laning phase, it's that simple! \n\nPlaystyle is the real answer, depending on who you're against or how you play really dictates the nature of the question.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-07-11T05:09:17.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That video was of \"crit-plank\" more than likely and Critplank is not a good idea. Its fun, but not that good to play in ranked.\n\nI woulodn't worry about him until you the rework pops out.\n\nWhat i used to do with GP was, if they are melee or had little to no sustain, I would harass. However if its like a Malphite with Flask 3 pots or a Riven with cloth+5 and keeps shielding the Q, I wouldnt bother.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-11T04:57:55.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the rework, you basically 100% want to farm with your Q.","replies":[]}]}
