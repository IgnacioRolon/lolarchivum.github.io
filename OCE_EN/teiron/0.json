Basically what happened was as I was just about to tunnel I got hit by Nami's bubble, after the bubble ended, could not cast anything, was able to move fine no spells or items could be casted. Even tried to leave the game and reconnect but it was still screwed up. Only fixed itself once I died.\r\n\r\nAnyone else manage to get this bug?","replies":[{"poster":"Teiron","date":"2014-12-22T11:25:07.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"haha i hope so too, that was one helluva weird bug. complete game killer if someone manages to get it","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2014-12-21T04:06:03.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What a way to get Rekt.
