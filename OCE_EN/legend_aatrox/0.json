His real rework would come a bit later along with the collective \"diver's update\" that's scheduled for some time in 2018 I think.\n\nSo yeah, it's happening, sit tight and get ready.

Riot has transformed his kit into a trydermere wannabe with his passive needing to hit things to maintain his revival passive and attack speed and extra ad. But unlike trydermere who can go in for 5 seconds without worrying about dying.
