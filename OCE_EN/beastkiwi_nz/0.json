I'm sure your team was grateful that you did end up returning and carried them all to victory (as you described it :3), but you still AFK'd nonetheless. And to be clear, you do not get leaverbuster for abandoning only 1 game, if you show continuous afk behaviour you will be placed into low priority (this means you must've left a game or several beforehand).\n\nRiot never restore LP or remove Low Priority unless it was a fault on their end (such as server crashes, maintenance issues, port or ISP problems), and your PC lag is not their problem or your teams problem.\n\nI hope you find and fix the source of your lag issues and return to the rift, summoner! \n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"UnspokenLaw","date":"2018-09-01T05:50:50.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||https://puu.sh/w7cMG/7dd5ea0998.png|\n|-\n\nThe freezing in-game is a known issue and is being worked on.\n\nIf you'd like insight as to why you received the penalty, touch base with Riotâ€™s [â˜£Player Behaviour Realm.â˜£](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)\n\n**Choose a Request type**\n\n*I have a question about a suspension or restriction on my account*\n\n**Do you know why your account was suspended / restricted?**\n\n*I have received an in-client LeaverBuster restriction*\n\n[ðŸ“©Be sure to check your request daily for a reply.ðŸ“©]( https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001731507-How-to-Check-on-a-Support-Ticket-League-of-Legends)\n\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||https://www.blogcdn.com/massively.joystiq.com/media/2012/10/lol-honor-header.jpg|\n|-\n\n---\n\nhttps://puu.sh/BmZZN/e580a5eb4b.png","replies":[]}]}
