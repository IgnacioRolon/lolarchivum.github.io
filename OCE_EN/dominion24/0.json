The loading screen is very slow now, and then once I enter the game it kicks me out to the desktop and I am unable to get back in.  My computer is only 6 months old, so not dealing with a dinosaur.  Have tried updating the drivers and re-installing League bit it didn&#039;t help.  Has anyone else had similar problems? Would appreciate any advice (assuming there is a way to fix this without having to revert back to Windows 8)","replies":[{"poster":"Pure4Phoenix","date":"2016-06-01T07:28:01.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do a full DirectX update, if you have any STEAM games like CS:GO on a seperate hdd it should already be downloaded in X:\\steam\\steamapps\\common\\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\\directx_installer\n\nI had to do it myself to stop league crashing to direct3d9 issues","replies":[]},{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-05-24T06:14:01.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nAre you sure you installed the Windows 10 drivers for your system, or did you just leave whatever you had installed initially when you upgraded?\n\nEnsure Windows is up to date.","replies":[]}]}
