First of all, great movie. But the thing that sparked my curiosity is that the character V, who dons a mask and plans to assassinate a group of people involved in a conspiracy which will help overthrow the totalitarian government, bears a remarkable likeness to Jhin. \r\n\r\nI&#039;ve read up on trivial facts about Jhin, but surprisingly none of them point towards this character? Was there no inspiration taken from this? Even the voice acting is somewhat similar in the way that he talks (his emphasis on certain letters in words are similar and his very precise and poetic way he speaks). V even &#039;conducts&#039; a symphony of music while he blows up a building which can be related to how he sees beauty in death. Also, the whole reason he wears a mask. \r\n\r\nEither way I like both characters. It just seems like a huge coincidence. But then again.... it could be an illusion of coincidence.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-02-16T09:17:02.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say they are probably related, but Warner Bros. and Virtual Studios are always looking to enforce their copyrights for a cut of the profits.\n\nSo for all intensive purposes; \n\n**_Jhin is not affiliated, inspired, a parody hereof or related, in any way, with V for Vendetta or any related trademarks and copyrights.

In other words, there are very very few 'coincidences'.\n\nMost if not all champs make at least some reference to pre-existing characters.\nObvious examples are:\n\nKatarina's 'Shunpo' is a direct reference to 'The flash step' (called Shunpo in japanese) which basically moves a person from point A to point B very quickly in a single step (exactly what Katarina does) \n\nKha'Zix and Rengar are portrayals of 'Alien' and 'Predator' respectively, (from the franchises of the same name)\nhttp://pre15.deviantart.net/7206/th/pre/f/2013/292/0/4/kvr__kha_zix_vs_rengar_by_exaxuxer-d6r0h2t.jpg (just a cool pice of artwork referencing the AvP poster)\n\nShaco is one big reference to the Joker from Batman (he even uses several direct quotes from 'The Dark Knight') \n\ni made a post here, showing the influence of 'Princess Mononoke' a movie by Studio Ghibli on several Champ/Skin designs.\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/j7VWQm68-ok-own-up-which-one-of-you-is-it?comment=0000\n\n-\n\nSo Given Riot's tendency to reference popular culture (which is a very very effective marketing strategy) i would say it is almost impossible for 'V for Vendatta'  NOT have had any influence on Jhin's design.","replies":[]}]}
