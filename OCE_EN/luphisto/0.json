(as shown in link)\r\n\r\n - It seems like a misdirected punishment for those that are innocent of dodging or leaving a game \r\n - furthermore the punishment seems a bit OTT even for the leaver. The only reason I can think of is to force the guilty party examine his/her wrong doing from sheer boredom.\r\n\r\nPS: I want to make it clear I&#039;m not questioning the need for leaverbuster as I have lost many games to leavers. I&#039;m sharing an opinion about an aspect of the game that i feel could be improved.\r\nPSS: Can we get a &quot;vote to dodge&quot; feature in lobby? Punishing people for not wanting to lose rank before the game even started, again seems pretty needlessly harsh to and encourages toxicity in picks and bans.","replies":[]}
