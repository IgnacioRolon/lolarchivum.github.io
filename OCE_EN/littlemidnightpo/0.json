The amount of toxic people here are out of the charts, OCE is very well known for its players because you will never get flamed or raged at like this on any other server. And the thing is every time you try to report a person for something like verbal abuse THEY NEVER GET BANNED, all they get is a pop up saying you've been reported for verbal abuse and i'm sure everyone has seen it. But the thing that makes me mad the most is that when you try really hard to win, like tonight I wanted to go to bed nice and happy but no instead I got matched up in the champion select with a full bronze 5 team and my god i've seen videos but it would scare you to meet them, they are nice in the select but then in game they rage, flame, troll and spam \"YOLO\" in all chat. I got extremely angry this game because my team would simply not co operate and so then they decided to troll and feed which put me in a bad mood because i just wanted to win but no instead they troll and go into fights they will never win. I was against a vel koz top, zed mid, morg support adc jax and roaming lee sin, 2 trolls(lee sin and jax) fed the team but my team NEVER did anything with the kills, they didn't take any advantages over the enemy team. It's just disappointing when you try to play the game properly but get matched with people who don't take the game seriously and yet if I tried to leave such a team I'm the one who gets banned by leavebuster, this issue has caused me to uninstall league of legends for a long time. Goodbye I hope you fix this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-04T10:03:13.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was it ranked?
