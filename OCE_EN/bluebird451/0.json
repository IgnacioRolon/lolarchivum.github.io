It seems like the only thing players actually get banned for is afking, which is the automated leave Buster system. Just had a ranked game where a sup asked for mid. Why? if you want to play mid, pick mid in que, but no, waiting a bit longer in que is tooo long, ill just say that i am  playing a role i don't intend on playing. After he didnt get mid he threatened to troll, and did, playing yasuo sup with ignite. I said that ill report him. He then proceeded to boast that he's been reported for 20 games straight, and that reporting him isnt gonna do anything, so he can continue with his toxic behavior unchallenged. This is a plea to riot. We at OCE love league, spend on league and want to improve league like everyone else, why do you let the toxic community continue to shit on good players who just wanna enjoy the game? Probs not gonna reply cus you probs dont give a shit about OCE anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-05-16T01:11:40.252+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nI just want to clarify a few things:\n\n+ Playing **Yasuo** support with ignite is not reportable. It might be frowned upon by the community, but we can't have a system were **Riot** is punishing people for not following the meta. **Riot** outlines this [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player#h2q5).\n\n It would be reportable if he proceeded to intentionally feed or[ purposefully loose](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player#h1q3). However it doesn't seem like he did that at all; his build is viable, he has good CS and his KDA doesn't seem to indicate that he was intentionally feeding.\n\n+ _\"After he didn't get mid he threatened to troll\"_\n [This](https://twitter.com/RiotLyte/status/689646191454195712?lang=en) is reportable, and he will be detected. The instant feedback system collects chat data from all sources,_ including pre-game/lobby chat_. If he does this enough it will result in punishment, even if he's not going through with his statements in-game.\n\n Sadly, most people don't know about this and might not have bothered/forgot to report him.\n\n> I understand it can be really stressful when you are matched with players in ranked who are hard to cooperate with, but please understand that part of League is working out compromises and adapting to what you have. \n\n> Remember that the report system is here to ensure you can play a  game without being harassed or having to endure unacceptable behavior. _**The report system is not here to ensure that all the games you have go perfectly, with everyone playing good champions with great KDAs**_.\n\nI hope this helped you understand our report process a bit better :)","replies":[]}]}
