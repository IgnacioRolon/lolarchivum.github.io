Try the former one first as it requires less download time.\n\nSecond fix:\n\nDelete your lol_air_client project folder located at: C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client\\ and patch up again.\nAs a heads up, this will delete your custom item sets if you have any so I would suggest to back them up before deleting the air client folder.

It's installed in C:\\Everything\\Games\\Riot Games\\League of... Nevertheless, I've tried the method you told DuckyNhoc to no avail. (Seriously, I don't think just 'redownload the patcher' is a feasible solution. Whatever caused it to stop working in the first place will happen again, so it only really solves the problem once, if at all. It would be better to find out *why* it isn't working, and to change that)\n\nI then tried deleting lol_air_client, and that brings me to this frozen state (after hours of waiting), screen attached. Note the 0 KBps. The way I solved this last time was by setting my DNS to port 8.8.8.8, but since the port is already set to that, it's just got me stuffed.\n\nI do hope you see this notification amongst the many I'm sure you have, since you have left by now.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DuckyNhoc","date":"2015-01-16T04:05:26.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't get on to the patcher it just stays at the league of legends logo and then the error occurs","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2015-01-16T04:38:15.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok try this:\n\n1) Delete the lol_launcher and lol_patcher folders located in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects.\n2) Restart PC and without opening anything else (turn off any background programs as well) run the patcher again, the LoL logo will stay there for a while with a little progress bar underneath it.
