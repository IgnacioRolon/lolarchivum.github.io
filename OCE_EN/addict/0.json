I have no new anti-virus software and the one I do have I&#039;m pretty sure doesn&#039;t have anything League-related blocked or identified as a threat. I&#039;ve tried hitting reconnect, tried shutting off the program and then re-opening to reconnect and I&#039;ve tried restarting the laptop and trying to reconnect again, none of those worked.","replies":[]}
