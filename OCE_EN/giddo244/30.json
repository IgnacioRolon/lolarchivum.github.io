Pick some defensive boots, build a lifesteal item - either Blade of the Ruined King or Bloodthirster (or both if you'd like) and if you think you need it grab a Last Whisper in your build as well. You can also build a defensive item like Guardian Angel but you generally build at least four offensive items.\n\nSo why? For the longest time Yasuo's core build was Berserker Greaves, Stattik Shiv and Infinity Edge with a couple of crit runes (5%) to max out Q Cooldown with Attack Speed, Max out Crit with your runes (remember he only needs 50%!) and create huge damage as a result from a very efficient build. Eventually people realized this was a little too squishy and started building Blade of the Ruined King or Bloodthirster 2nd to help offset the brittle farming period between getting your Stattik Shiv and getting your Infinity Edge. \n\nAs a soft rule, you built Blade of the Ruined King for duelling, split pushing and for the Attack Speed so you could buy Defensive Boots (either Mercs or Tabi) instead of Greaves.\n\nAnd on the flipside you built Bloodthirster to help mitigate burst damage, but when you didn't want Mercs or Tabi as a more aggressive mid-game option.\n\nAs it turned out these builds turned out to be optimal for a number of reasons and was the staple/core Yasuo build for ages. There was certainly no room in this build for an expensive item like Trinity Force, so what changed?\n\nA number of patches ago we changed the amount of crit on Infinity Edge to tone down the early power of the item in the hands of AD Carries who at the time were doing too much with too little in their early item pathing. As it turns out that ended up hurting Yasuo as well as so much of your damage comes from having guaranteed crit from your passive. \n\nSince that change a lot of different builds were suggested to try and compensate for that missing crit (including taking 10% crit runes which made your early game pretty awful) until players started building Trinity Force which turned out to be the missing ingredient post-IE.\n\nSo why? Well, turns out Yasuo benefits for practically every element of the item even gaining some unique properties that his old build couldn't offer him.\n\n- The Phage part gives health and AD which is great, but the move speed passive lets your better stick to targets your chasing, particularly without a minion wave to dash through.\n- The Sheen part provides you burst damage which gives you a huge boost in duelling power in the mid-game where traditionally you'd be farming up towards your Infinity Edge rather than fighting.\n- The Zeal part give you movespeed, attack speed and crit and happens to give you the magical number of 10%! Which makes up for the lost Infinity Edge crit chance with ZERO added crit runes which let's you run smoother and more efficient early game runes.\n\nThe only part of the item that Yasuo gets fully zero benefit from is the mana from the Sheen, but everything else actually ends up making up for that gold inefficiency. \n\nThe biggest benefit from this build is that you're not hugely effective at two items rather than having to wait for three. Stattik Shiv, Merc Treads, Trinity Force Yasuo is a power house and gives you a ton of mid-game flexibility as you move towards your Infinity Edge.\n\nSo that's why I think the item is core to Yasuo! In saying that Talon12 made some great points too so I'll address those below:\n\n- **\"_his q will only gain effect from trinity if it is 1v1 if no others around, minions negate the effect of sheen, doing nothing for him in lane_\"** - I didn't actually realize this worked this way but ran a quick custom game test and you're right! Thankfully the 'Sheen' element of the item will always apply to the FIRST target hit, which is pretty easy to line up even in lane and is crazy threatening in duels.\n\n- **\"_if they have tanks like rammus and maokai with high armor, especially if they have a thornmail, it would be ideal to build lastwhisper over trinity_\"** - Yasuo's ulti does a great job negating a lot of high armour targets as does Blade of the Ruined King in fighting Thornmail and big tanks. Last Whisper can be a great late-game item if you REALLY need that frontline dead but I'm not sure it's better than Trinity Force, especially as a second item. The nice thing about TForce is that is transitions very smoothly from just its components so those big, scary tanks aren't going to be around until you're already pretty well-equipped to deal with them. If I was REALLY behind a huge tank I'd still probably build Blade of the Ruined King before Last Whisper, slotting it in after my Trinity Force and delaying my IE.\n\n- **\"_these can also be replaced with zephyr_\"** - This is AWESOME. And something I haven't even thought of, definitely a cool item to throw into builds as another defensive option. Can be really good with say Ninja Tabi, Bloodthirster and Zephyr, I'll certainly be giving this one a go at some point!\n\nSo those are my thoughts on why I think Trinity Force is now Core to Yasuo! Yasuo is one of my favourite champions so I'd be more than happy to continue this discussion if you'd like. Seems like we've already got some good discussion going and I hope you all give Trinity Force Yasuo a try! (Just don't forget to Max that E first!)\n\nCheers!\n\nBONUS SECTION: Here's one of the first Trinity Force Yasuo's I saw in competitive and my co-caster does an excellent job explaining the build. It also happens to be an awesome game from the Chinese Pro League (LPL), enjoy!  \n\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1jAuC7G1DU&t=7m27s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1jAuC7G1DU&t=7m27s)","replies":[{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2015-08-26T13:06:11.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1+ For the effort and detailed post (: Will try Trinity Force Yas and see how it goes, what would you suggest as a build path for yasuo where trinity force fits in?

Sheen is never really useful as a build path item and you usually finish your Trinity Force by having a Phage and a Zeal and then finishing the item outright.\n\nComponents-wise Phage is for fighting and Zeal is for pushing although Phage is a better first component as a general rule.
