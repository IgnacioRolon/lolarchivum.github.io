He doesn't have the best clears and his build paths in the jungle can be a little strange. You want to get mana on Maokai asap which is why Righteous Glory or RoA are always rushed on him in the top lane. Still, it can be fine. Just get Righteous after Cinderhulk.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-05-30T00:12:42.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maokai for Top\nGragas for Jungle.\n\nThese two are like the Oriannas and Threshes of their respective roles. They are good at **everything**. They aren't fantastic at any one thing but they both have good peel, good initiation, good pick potential, decent jungle/wave clears, get ridiculously tanky and have surprising damage with how tanky they get.","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-05-29T23:55:56.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd probably go with maokai, but gragas might be better if you're leaning more towards jungle. Both are good at one role and decent at the other. Maokai is easier to play effectively though, gragas ult takes a bit of getting used to and can do more harm than good if it's not used well. Shyvana is decent top but a pretty mediocre jungler imo, since she relies more on farming and doesnt have good cc.","replies":[]}]}
