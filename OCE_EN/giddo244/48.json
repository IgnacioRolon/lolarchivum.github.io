Then regroup and push down mid together with empowered minions and try to seize the tower.   \n\nIn this cases, you also need to consider the risk. \nTo evaluate this you should consider how many and which enemies are still alive, and how long will it take them to get back into the fight. \nConsider whether they enemies need to recall, or if some can stay a defend without losing time. \nAlso consider which enemy is alive, a healed up {{champion:7}} will be able to pick off low members of your team, whereas a {{champion:40}} will apply less kill pressure. \nAlso keep in mind death timers, which change based on time in game, and whether enemies have homeguards or teleport (things that will make them come into a fight quicker). \nWhen enemies are unable to defend/contest an objective it is called FREE. \n\nSo after a successful fight, balance the value of the objective, with the risk of taking it. \nBe realistic with how much time you have to secure an objective, and how much time you have till the enemy will punish. \nMake sure you take any free objectives, and communicate it with your team, so you can all work together to take objective in the most efficient manner.  \n\nI hope I haven't overloaded you, and if you would like be to discuss some more important points I would be happy to try :).","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-03-04T10:53:35.875+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"BTW, kills are not objectives. to those who forget and lose tower chasing a low thresh","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-04T10:55:54.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Indeed.\nTowers don't respawn.
