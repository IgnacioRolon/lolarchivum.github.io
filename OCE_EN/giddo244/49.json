Wait for an opening strike and move quickly away. It is important to master jungle dashing as it will create situational initiates and escapes it's always been handy for me.","replies":[{"poster":"giddo244","date":"2015-04-18T04:19:36.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's jungle dashing?

Honestly though yasuo is harder than ever to play, recent nurfs have literally destroyed his laning phase potential, he can get ganked soo easily and on top of that he's effectively useless until late mid and late game. If you can't farm effectively yasuo is impossible to play.","replies":[{"poster":"giddo244","date":"2015-04-18T04:25:35.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So pressing E right next to a monster or over the wall?","replies":[{"poster":"Sniff","date":"2015-04-18T05:04:57.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"works both ways So long as you have vision","replies":[{"poster":"giddo244","date":"2015-04-18T06:43:19.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Antodara","date":"2015-04-15T07:08:28.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo should be played very carefully unless you're against an AD champ in top lane where you can harass them a lot due to the longer range on your Q than most champs (darius's Q is slightly longer), and your ability to knockup without using resources.\n\nIn mid lane, fight with care, poke with your tornado and try not to die. Last longer and farm better with your Q, and rush infinity edge. \n\nUse E to dash to a minion, Q your opponent, and use E to dash back past your minion wave through another minion. It's a common technique. Your dash doesn't just dash you TO a minion, you dash THROUGH them, up to the maximum distance the E allows.","replies":[]}]}
