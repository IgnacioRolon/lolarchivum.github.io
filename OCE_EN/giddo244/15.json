What do you think of it? I personally hope that they compensate for him somehow, but I think we all know that won't happen.

I mean, isn't it better to spam your ult more rather than just a \"SURPRISE MUTHA...\"?

And they would be happy with Irelia if she wasn't both a great duellist and also have unnecessary Tenacity that increases per nearby enemy from her passive.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
