Does this mean: Jhin Total AD= Jhin Base AD+2 - 40% + 4%(crit from zeal) + 2.5%(from some attack speed item). Also from the formula, does the 4% per 10% crit chance refer to 4% of crit chance or 4% of Total AD? Same for the attack speed one.","replies":[{"poster":"CyanPhoenix","date":"2016-01-27T17:49:45.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm gonna use an example with completely made up numbers (to make this easy for me lol)\n\nsay jhin has 50 base AD, is level 8 (from the wiki this gives a 10% AD increase), and has items that give 50% crit chance, 40% attack speed and 50 AD.\n\nso, his final AD would be his base + bonus AD = 100, increased by 10% from level + 20% from the crit chance + 10% from AS, which equals a 40% AD increase, giving him 140 total AD.\n\ni bet that just made you and everyone who reads this more confused but what ever xD","replies":[{"poster":"MinusPlus","date":"2018-11-13T16:54:23.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yep{{champion:202}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-01-27T15:39:37.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"1st off, this is all a percent multiplier (not a % addition) it seems from the calculations.\n\n2ndly, it's 4% of an increase per 10% crit chance.","replies":[]}]}
