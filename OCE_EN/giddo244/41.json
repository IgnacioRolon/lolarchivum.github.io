Since I think you are playing ad ez I suggest getting tier 2 boots fast, allowing you to dodge his skill shots. All his burst comes from his skillshots so if you dodge those you good. I suggest getting tear into manamune and an iceborn. Allowing you to have a chase to chase up to him if he gets rylias. Don't underestimate his burst and hover e until you get finish b because that ult could come out of nowhere. Or you could b in unconventional places like wolves. But I want to stress DON'T THINK DOES NO DAMAGE. Don't give him kills. With 1 kill, if he can land a full combo he can 1 shot someone. But if you fight him in a long term, and dodge most of his w and/or q then you have the high dps and sustained damage to kill him","replies":[]}]}
