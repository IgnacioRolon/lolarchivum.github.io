The person is great in terms of mechanics and plays top and mid a ton; however, as good as he is mechanically, he doesn&#039;t seem to be able to grasp objective control and how or when to group and how or when not to group. This person often tunnel views on farm and his tower alone and doesn&#039;t use teleport optimally, using it to tp top or mid to protect his tower when a huge teamfight is going down bot. He recently asked me how he could win more games, and since this person is very strong headed and confident in their abilities, I was wondering how I could tell them about all these things. I have tried to explain before but not to great affect Any tips?","replies":[{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-03-26T07:08:18.760+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tell them to picture the game as a pizza and that every part of the map is a slice. In order to eat the whole pizza you can't just focus on your own slice.
