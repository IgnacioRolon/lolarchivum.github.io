(Followed by a deathcap, haunting guise and void).\n\nShe's a frontliner or assassin normally and as such tanky AP or full AP works out great. Don't be afraid to try new things. Rylais has a lot of synergy with her skill-set if you can pull off some good ganks ie are playing her mid or maybe even jungle, as for top id rush rod of ages and deathcap or if youre mid try and rush zhonyas or deathcap (often after a haunting guise and boots of spell pen.\n\nShes an awesome ganker and if you can push your lane out and down a turret she can be devastating. Mejais can be great too as she can initiate and deal aot of damage - escape and gain assists or even kills and most of the time I play Diana its pretty easy to pick up stacks. (When she was first released her spells did a lot more damage and rushing 2xdorans and boots of spell pen allowed for kills, mejais helped her damage, deathcap helped her capitalize and even without mejais she could blitz carries and void stopped champions magic resist being as life-saving so I guess another build that would work well would be Boots of spell pen, 2x dorans, deathcap and void staff but I think a zhonyas is a great first item too followed by deathcap and void if youre fed or just void for the magic resist shred (maybe 2x dorans, boots of spell pen, haunting guise, deathcap, void, zhonyas is another good build).\n\nIt really depends, - rod of ages is good vs bursters like kat in mid lane, rushed deathcap is good vs a balanced team and zhonyas is great vs AD.\n\nOther than that: Check out Team Curse's builds/guides: http://www.lolpro.com/guides/diana\n\nOr the Riot Champion spotlight: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7WSLWcACiw","replies":[]}]}
