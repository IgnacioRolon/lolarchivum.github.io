So are there any other junglers that can do what he does (great ganks, initiation and general all-rounder) but as an actual tank? I was thinking Skarner or Vi.","replies":[{"poster":"KagamiArata","date":"2015-09-22T09:01:49.411+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe try {{champion:106}} Volibear. For his build just build him full tank and stack health. He has pretty nice early clears and doesn't take much damage in the jungle. His   ganks are good in my opinion and his passive is just really good. Im not sure how he does late game but im sure he will be good. Other than that try {{champion:120}} jungle. I haven't try hecarim in the jungle but his ult which is an aoe fear is definitely a good initiation tool. I would recommend you to build a trinity force on hecarim as your only damage item because it synergise very well with hecarim's kit. the other cahmpion i can think of is{{champion:113}} which is one of my favourite jungle champion her ganks are really good and her ult is perfect for teamfights. For sejuani build i would recommend {{item:3725}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3800}} {{item:3117}} {{item:3102}}  you can swap the boots of mobility into a {{item:3111}}. You can also swap the randuin's omen for a {{item:3151}} if u don't need that much armor because your passive already gives u quite a lot of free armor when u damage an enemy champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-09-22T09:23:20.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:79}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:113}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"KagamiArata","date":"2015-09-22T09:23:13.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rammus {{champion:33}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"MaximumWifeSteal","date":"2015-09-22T09:10:55.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you are looking for tanky initiation junglers that still do some damage, i enjoy playing {{champion:32}}  and {{champion:57}} . You can build full tank and still 1v1 the majority of the adc's, unlesss of course they are good kiters. The only problems with these guys is the low amount of sustain in the early jungler can often leave them vulnerable to invades. But definitely worth a try.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DW GunGale","date":"2015-09-22T08:51:11.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vi.","replies":[]}]}
