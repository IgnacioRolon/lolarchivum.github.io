All of Fiora's physical damage comes from basic attacks or on-hit, so Death's Dance has no advantage with healing. The CDR isn't necessary since you'll already be capped if you have the right runes and BT gives more AD I believe, plus the shield. So Death's Dance isn't worth it on Fiora unless you're doing some mega-heal build.","replies":[]}]}
