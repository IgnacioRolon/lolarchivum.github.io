Any other opinions?\n\nHave you read this? \n\n\"From what I understand, the team just wanted to try out a few different avenues as to how we want to nerf Skarner. Though it won't show up on the PBE over the holiday weekend, I believe the plan is to go with a pared down version of these nerfs for final changes. \nIt seems worth noting here that it can be difficult to really try more than one thing out at a time in an effort to land on the correct change when it comes to nerfs and buffs, because we tend to get large reactions from players when we do so. I'm not saying that reaction isn't justified (since we don't have the greatest history of being fully transparent on every change you see on the PBE), but I do think that's what is going on in this case.\"\n\nsource (http://www.surrenderat20.net/2015/11/red-post-collection-illaoi-introduction.html)\n\nLooks like the nerfs won't be as bad as they are at the moment. But he is getting nerfed yeah. So up to you if you want to keep playing him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"giddo244","date":"2015-11-27T10:06:21.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Already have J4, so I'll probably try Vi and Lee.

He's not really OP ATM just kinda strong. Yet they are giving Brand (the guy on 56% winrate) the smallest nerf out. Riot WTF?\n\nI think the nerfs are quite bad actually, so yeah I'd probably switch mains for a bit. Most tanks are pretty bad ATM. Here's my list of people you might want to try out:\n\n1. {{champion:59}}  Jarvan\n2. {{champion:254}} Vi\n3. {{champion:64}}  Lee Sin\n4. {{champion:54}}  Malphite (Not so great in higher elo)\n5. {{champion:33}} Rammus (Haven't actually played this guy since season 4 tank meta, but his winrate is respectable.)\n\nThose are all the good lockdown junglers, {{champion:32}} Amumu is a debatable option right now too. The mana struggles are so real though.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-27T06:38:02.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its adc meta... rammus is the anti adc tank...","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-11-27T06:40:44.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He has poor clear time though, in a bruiser jungle meta.
