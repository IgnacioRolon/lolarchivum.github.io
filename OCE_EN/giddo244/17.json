Minion pathing will be a little annoying to deal with on him, but that's about it. You'll have to see how the Hecarim changes effect you personally, before deciding on switching mains for a while.\n\nJust for the record though, if you're just looking for OP champions to main then **Gangplank **and **Fiora** are very average right now. Neither of them is any higher than 50% winrate, and they are super hard to play. They fell out of favor about 3 patches ago.\n\nYou're much better of going for one of the following actually OP champions:\n\n{{champion:54}} **Malphite: **Super OP this meta, no counters or nerfs in the foreseeable future.\n{{champion:24}}** Jax:** Still no real nerf on Guinsoo's next patch, to the OP will continue\n{{champion:77}} **Udyr:** Same as Jax\n{{champion:39}}** Irelia:** ^^\n{{champion:23}} **Tryndamere:** Crit mastery is still awesome on him.\n{{champion:36}} **Dr. Mundo:** Careful with this one, he's being nerfed in 5.24. I still think he's still going to be OP, but you never know.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-06T06:31:10.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"mundo  isn't getting nerfed what so ever... pretty sure a max damage cap on q held at 500 for jg creeps and changing e total stale by -0.5% scale till rank 5 does do much...
