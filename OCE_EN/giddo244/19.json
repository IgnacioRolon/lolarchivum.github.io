So I&#039;ve just gotten into Jayce and my current build path looks something like: CDR boots, tear>muramana, a bf sword item(infinity or blood) or both if I&#039;m very ahead, youmuu&#039;s and or black cleaver. So I&#039;m having trouble figuring out when to build which armor pen item or to just get both, which bf item is better and if Essence Reaver is necessary on Jayce. Also, what is the best way to stack tear on Jayce? Leave it on the tear or get manamuna asap? Feel free to add your own build in the comments","replies":[{"poster":"Salty Nips","date":"2015-06-24T22:36:26.776+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I go something like >muramana > tier 1 boots > brutalizer > lw > ghostblade > cdr/merc boots > blackcleaver > bt or defensive item of your choice (banshee, maw, qss etc) I don't think essence reaver is very good","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2015-06-25T02:26:57.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tear/muramana, brutalizer, black cleaver, last whisper, tier 2 boots(generally situational), last item is always situational but stick to your basic qss/banshees/ga/BT/randuins, generally don't finish your youmuus till last possible item because its generally a waste of gold, can also swap the brutalizer for a  hexdrinker if you feel too squishy but the same thing as brutalizer dont upgrade until last item, as for essence reaver i wouldnt bother it will just delay your power spike, as for infinity edge, it's generally a no go for ad casters but be can somewhat useful depending on how far ahead you are","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-25T05:46:39.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">as for infinity edge, it's generally a no go for ad casters but be can somewhat useful depending on how far ahead you are\n\nExcept for the fact that Jayce scales decently with IE as his Cannon form W actually can crit for the full damage (2.75* damage auto's)","replies":[{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2015-06-30T09:56:07.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=pb2zP5MY,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-06-25T05:46:39.896+0000)\n>\n> Except for the fact that Jayce scales decently with IE as his Cannon form W actually can crit for the full damage (2.75* damage auto's)\n\nthats why i said it can be somewhat useful but youre not going to be charging in with your w in most team fights and its not in direct build path for laning phase","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-24T11:53:28.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get Manamuna ASAP or your just gonna run OOM trying to stack the damn thing.\n\nEssence Reaver is a shit item and is only somewhat buyable on Blue Ezreal.\n\nYoumuu's is trash on Jayce.\n\nBC and LW are the Pen items you want cause they stack on you like bullshit.","replies":[]}]}
