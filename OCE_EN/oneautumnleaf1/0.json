To do that find the .exe file (commonly located in \"C:/Riot Games/League of Legends\" with the name \"lol.launcher\"). Right click on the program and choose \"Run as administrator\". If the prompt pops up asking you to give it permissions hit yes.\n\nIf this does not solve the issue another way that can commonly solve the problem is to make sure that you don't have any anti virus programs running or any other programs that scan your computer/create firewalls. These can be programs such as Windows Defender, Malware Antibytes or Avast. \n\nIf these two solutions don't work you can always try repairing your client or submitting a support ticket at: http://support.riotgames.com/ There are also Wrenchmen that are around on these boards that I am sure will be able to help you as well. Let me know if the solutions that I have recommended work and if you have any questions let me know and I will try to answer the best I can!\n\n~Elam","replies":[]},{"poster":"OneAutumnLeaf1","date":"2016-11-10T09:30:56.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still happening can someone help please","replies":[]},{"poster":"superplebb","date":"2016-11-01T13:24:21.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if anyone finds a current solution, please share","replies":[]}]}
