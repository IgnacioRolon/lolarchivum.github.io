Looking for someone who is determined and actually is serious about climbing and not just playing for fun. Looking for preferably a Mid player (but open to any other roles) to help skirmish early crabs and follow up on invades or getting invaded. for season 8 i prob played 5% percent of my ranked games playing with a Duo, so i generally just play for myself in games cause i know i can carry if i get a lead. My Goal for the start of Season 9 is to hit diamond and progressively move up ranks during the season and i definitely feel i am capable of earning the rank even if i play only by myself.\r\n\r\nA bit about myself:\r\nMale, 18, Studying a university, play very little variety of games (mostly League).\r\n\r\nGood Traits:\r\n- Carry Material.\r\n- Know how to abuse leads.\r\n- Usually pretty Consistent.\r\n- Play very often and always keen to improve on my play.\r\n-  will tell a player to fuck off if they are talking shit to you x.\r\n\r\n(like everybody has) Bad Traits:\r\n- Some Define me as &quot;toxic&quot; but i&#039;d rather honest.\r\n- If I don&#039;t have good synergy with you i prob will not continue with our duo.","replies":[{"poster":"Fakers Child ","date":"2019-01-18T03:00:52.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, so im interested however, I main jungle also but secondary is mid lane so yeah I hit diamond recently with Juingle/Mid hmu if you want to duo for s9? you can look at my profile before you add me.","replies":[]}]}
