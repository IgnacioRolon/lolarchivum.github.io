If all looks correct, it's more than likely that your account may have been compromised. As such, please take all of the steps below to regain control of your League of Legends account and reverse any unwanted actions that the individual who compromised your account may have taken:\n\n\n1. Run a complete anti-virus scan on your computer and remove any malware that is detected. If you don't have an anti-virus program, I recommend downloading either [**MalwareBytes Free**](https://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/) or [**ESET NOD32 with a free 30 day trial**](http://download.eset.com/special/live-installer/us/eset_nod32_antivirus_live_installer.exe). Either or should be able to get the job done. \n2. Once the scans have run and any detections are removed, change any accounts/passwords that you believe may have been compromised. This may include your email account(s), League of Legends account (if you still have access to it; if not, skip to the \"Submitting a ticket\" step), and Riot Games Player Support account if you already have one. You can change your League of Legends password by going to the [**League of Legends account area**](https://account.leagueoflegends.com/na/en/protect) in the top-right corner of this page. Click on your summoner name, and select \"Settings\". In the box that comes up, click \"Change Password\" and follow said steps. (Make sure that your email account is secure before doing this step, as a confirmation email will be sent to the corresponding email account.)\n3. Now that your accounts are secure, it's time to contact Riot Games Player Support to deal with the unauthorized actions on your account and/or recovering your account. \n\n\n>#Submitting a Ticket\n\n\nTo contact Riot Games Player Support, you'll need to [**submit a ticket on the Riot Games Support website**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us). In the ticket, please submit the following information along with whatever information you can provide about your situation: \n**[NOTE: DO NOT POST THIS INFORMATION ON THE BOARDS. SUBMIT THEM IN A TICKET!]**\n>Account Name (the name you log into the LoL client with):\nSummoner Name (the name your friends see in-game):\nThe server you play on (NA, EU-West or EU-Nordic/East):\nWhen was the last time that you had access to the account (Month/Day/Year):\nCreation date of the account (Month and Year):\nOriginal email address used to register the account:\nLocation where you registered the account (City and Country):\nList of locations that you have played on this account(City and Country):\nLast IP address used to play League of Legends - http://whatsmyip.net/\nInternet Service Provider (ISP)/Internet Carrier when registering the account:\nOther people who have ever had access to the account:\nHow did you first come into possession of the account:\nIf Applicable:\n\n\n>Location of RP purchases (City and Country):\nApproximate dates of most recent RP purchases:\nEmail address linked to PayPal account:\nUnique PayPal transaction IDs associated with purchase(s):\nPhone number(s), mobile provider, and country used for SMS transactions:\nAny PaySafe Card PIN/Transaction IDs:\nAny Prepaid RP card PINs:\nThe last 4 digits and expiration date of any credit card(s) used to purchase RP:\nAny transaction or confirmation numbers received via email for this account:\n\n\nLastly, to increase your chances of a quick resolution to your request, follow the tips below the best that you can:\n\n\n1. Create an account on the Riot Games Support website. It'll save you a lot of time in the future and keep your requests organized and easier to find/access.\n2. Be sure to submit as much information in your initial ticket as possible. For obvious reasons, each Player Support Specialist's request for more information will delay the resolution of the issue.\n3. Be respectful and polite in your correspondences with Riot Support. (They're doing their best to help you!)\n4. Try not create a new ticket or respond to an existing ticket before a Player Support Specialist has had the chance to review your request. New tickets/replies may bump your ticket back to the bottom of the queue, thus increasing the amount of time before a Player Support Specialist is able to review your ticket.  \n\n\nI know that there are quite a bit of steps listed above, so if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. Best of luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"lordofrage","date":"2015-11-24T02:06:02.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they dont just come right away","replies":[]}]}
