Opinions? Feel free to comment if there are any other skins with different particles for significant things like this. I mean, it's not major but whether or not Ahri gets a smidge of SV on her next Q is comparatively minor imo. If you're counterjungling against a Yi, knowing whether or not he's getting free damage from his Wuju passive and has the active ready for use could easily determine if you're going to win a trade against him early (for example, if he's just activated his Wuju on a camp). Opinions? If anything I reckon Yi should have his Wuju colours normalized across all his skins, while the colour of Ahri's Q should be allowed to be changed.","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2014-12-11T03:05:59.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only thing I could see being close to Ahris orb is Syndras so as long as Riot doesn't give Ahri a dark black/purple orb I don't think it messes with clarity much after all heaps of champs have massively changed particle colors/effects on their skins why should Ahri be any different.","replies":[]}]}
