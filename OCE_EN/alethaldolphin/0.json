Along comes this guy who starts bad mouthing me in game. He then decided to add me after the match was over, and continued to keep constantly trying to insult me. Is there any way for this person to be punished? Maybe a chat ban so as he does not verbally abuse anyone else in game, as it does tend to bring some people down and can cause them to lash out as well.","replies":[{"poster":"WE WUZ KINGZ","date":"2016-04-25T11:24:44.748+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why would you add him tho???? {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-04-25T11:59:56.999+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"NOBODY KNOWS {{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Taric Main","date":"2016-04-27T06:46:25.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe they're a masochist and wanted more of it?  {{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}} \n\nJokes aside that's pretty terrible. \n\n@OP - I suggest reporting them?

If its the person thats flaming all day, just reject it. Its actually funny how people cry about being abused when they already left the game.
