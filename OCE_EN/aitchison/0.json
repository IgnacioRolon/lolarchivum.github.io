I find that last season every player was around my skill level and now it seems like there is a massive influx of complete noobs and complete pros.\r\n\r\nIts getting to the point im thinking F*** IT im going to DOTA 2\r\n\r\nAnyway that's my little tiff cheers","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-01-31T11:55:53.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol, you are lvl 16","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-01-31T09:59:26.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its always like that when a new season starts... give it a month or 2 for people to get where they are supposed to be and games get closer.","replies":[]}]}
