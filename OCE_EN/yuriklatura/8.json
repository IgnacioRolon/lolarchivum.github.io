A behind healing based champion is worthless, whereas it doesn't matter how brain dead you are, you can play the above champions, feed 10 kills then carry the game just because.\n\nI got fed as Aatrox/Vladimir/Yorick or even god damn Cho Gath through outplaying my opponent. I earned my lead. Every heal oriented champion, with the slight exception of Mundo is balanced around the fact that they can heal for incredible amounts. And even in the case of Mundo, the heal is over 12 seconds. That's a long time and with so many % health items and champions in the game, bursting him is not that difficult. Try buying BoRK or Liandry's, grab some popcorn and watch that health bar drop. \n\nBecause I have fought so many trash players that pick Yasuo, Riven, Lee Sin, Gangplank or Fiora, over time I have learned that the players who pick those champions, regardless of actual skill level are so garbage that they have to pick champions that play the game for them. Champions that can make more mistakes than any other champion and not get punished for it. Believe it or not, even Mundo has to worry about his positioning.\n\nVladimir is manaless, and that locks him out of a significant amount of items that give him armour and magic resist, ability power and even cool down reduction. He realistically can only build health and ability power to maximise the value from his passive. This makes him extremely squishy to % health damage. Even doubling up on Zhonya's and his W, 4 seconds of relative invulnerability, also means he can't heal off anything but his ult. Oh also, Vladimir has no fucking mobility. Letting a Vladimir farm when you are probably playing Lee Sin jungle like 68% of the playerbase is a clear mistake, and you will pay for it late game. And you should be punished, instead of being able to take the easy way out and buy broken items to make him heal about as fast as a Draven with 2 Rabadons, Luden's Echo, Guinsoos and a Gunblade. \n\nMundo is ridiculously squishy early game, even post 6/pre 11. If you are playing a ranged harasser like Gangplank or a champion with stupid amounts of damage coupled with blatantly unfun mobility like Riven or Fiora and you have not shoved him out of reliable farming 8 times by 6 minutes, then you should consider maybe switching to a more casual game. All he has going for him is farming from range with his Q. Again, zero mobility. Junglers should punish him for even stepping a Darius auto out of position. A 2/11 Mundo late game is as tanky as AP Leona. Additionally, DON'T TRY TO FIGHT HIM 1V1 33 MINUTES INTO THE GAME? ??? ?\n\nAatrox is garbage in almost all matchups. Until he gets 4 no-no bars. If you try to fight then die to a Hellbent Aatrox, it is your own fault. But an Aatrox without Hellbent has about the same dueling power as a Karthus with attack speed runes that started W. This is assuming a 1v1 situation. Aatrox is a champion that quite literally cannot teamfight unless he is 63/0. Even then, if he is not auto attacking, he is not healing. Simple as that. Burst or CC will drop that health bar in exactly 1.36 seconds. Exactly the same as a fed Yi. Being able to shut down a specialised duelist/skirmisher/split pusher with an 800 gold item, but then Riven players can just press 4 buttons to drop your health by 60% then do it again in another 8 seconds because you missclicked to within 500 range of a melee minion, that's not fun. Aatrox is weak and pathetic without his passive ready, so fight him when it is down. THAT IS A CLEAR WEAKNESS, and can be exploited by simply not being bad at V I D E O G A M E S.\n\nYorick doesn't even heal for that much, but it is still a significant portion of his kit. Yorick is what a Juggernaught/Fighter should look like. A champion that does stupid damage, but only if you let him near you. And the only thing he has is a trap that can be escaped by 60% of the roster with one button, a 30% slow and 20% boosted movement speed. That's it. He can't go from tower to tower in two skill rotations in less than 14 seconds like some champions, and is extremely vulnerable to kiting.\n\nI know a lot of people will disagree with me, but I truly believe Cho Gath takes more skill than Riven. Not mechanical skill obviously, but positioning and map awareness. He has absolutely zero mobility, and not being aware of your surroundings, and being stuck too far up in lane, then getting ganked by a 3/0 Lee Sin that flash kicks you into the 0/4 Fiora under tower, you have no way out. You can't press 4 buttons then be in the clear like Riven, you can't just E through the incoming wave as Yasuo, you are stuck there to contemplate the meaning of life as Fiora's 17% max health true damage every second shreds you. You counter Cho Gath by bursting that giant hp bar. If you half ass it, he is just going to heal right back up with his passive. That is a clear strength. And a competent player can play around it. He is tagged as a tank for a reason. \n\nBuying Grievous Wounds of any kind automatically says to me that you are incapable of adapting to and capitalising on a champions weaknesses. Every single heal oriented champion has clear weaknesses, usually their laning phase vulnerability.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-07-04T06:09:58.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Grevious wounds is a counter to sustain because realistically playing against a fed vladimir, swain, darius, mundo, illoai, tank karma, olaf, trundle, warwick, ect... feels bad because you hit them with a full spell rotation and work as a team to bring them low, only to see your work undone in moments.\n\nRealistically as sustain champions once you get a few items and a spirit visage, you are still powerful even with your healing being cut by 40%, and that only applies if the enemy team has ignite, mortal reminder, or a way to bring you under 35% hp for morellos.\n\nA fed mundo is not fun (well I mean it's really really fun to play but) to play against, because he can get to a point where when he ults he literally will run around your base and diving your nexus turrets whilst simultaneously regenerating a tik more than 7% of his max hp per second (mundo will usually have around 500hp per second regen in total) of his stupid 6.5k healthpool and he just runs up and 1shots you with his titanic and e reset combo, and you're just watching him run around your grey screen, still tanking nexus turrets for what feels like a bajillion years as he shruggs off cc and any attempts your team makes at trying to bring him down for the next 12s (which is a really long time in league of legends). If you can't burst that 6.5k hp mundo, he now has a functional 11.3k hp total until his ult expires.\n\nNow with grievous wounds, he's only regenerating 300hp per second instead of 500hp, and his functional health becomes a more manageable 10.1k.\n\nI like playing mundo, vladimir and other sustain gods but I am a strong believer that ignite is very justified when facing sustain champions because otherwise things can easily get out of hand.\n\nYeah sure if you fall behind as a sustain champion, grievous wounds guts you and leaves you out to dry, but conversely if you get ahead, without grievous wounds there is basically nothing to keep you in check. Also last I checked, darius, mundo, vladimir, swain, olaf, trundle, warwick, were all very powerful meta champions, despite grievous wounds existing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-07-04T02:49:12.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You need to have some counter play against champions with 30% lifesteal or a Vladimir","replies":[]},{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2017-07-03T13:40:31.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so how about we remove lifesteal as well? and soraka.","replies":[]}]}
