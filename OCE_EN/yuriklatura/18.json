By the way, the passive is not based on new Sion's passive, I thought of it before his rework.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m basing this champion off of the psycho guy DLC character from Borderlands 2. Essentially high risk high reward AD duellist who can easily assassinate almost any target but is easily caught out, due to him having no real escape. I know right? We don’t have enough of those. \r\n\r\nPassive Ability: Meat Bicycle! \r\nKrieg gains movement speed and attack damage as he deals and receives damage. Additionally, upon being reduced to 0 health, Krieg regains all of his health after a brief immobility animation, and gains 100% bonus attack damage and 35% movement speed for 5 seconds before finally dying. Krieg cannot cast abilities during this time, but if he attains a champion kill, he is revived with full health at his current position. The kill gold is not taken away from his killer. \r\nMovement Speed: 0.5/1/1.5 flat for every hit taken and dealt\r\nAttack Damage: 1/2/3 flat for every hit taken and dealt\r\nThis stacks infinitely, and the amount of bonuses are shown as a buff. However they will completely disappear not taking or dealing damage for 4 seconds. The death bonus has no cool down.\r\n\r\nFirst Ability: Bloody Axe Throw\r\nKrieg throws his axe in a direction. If it strikes an enemy, they are slowed and are dealt a base physical damage plus bonus damage and slow based on their missing health. The axe then gets stuck in the enemy, and if Krieg basic attacks the affected enemy, the cool down is reduced by 3 seconds.\r\n\r\nBase physical damage: 40/70/100/130/160 plus 40% AD\r\nMissing health bonus damage equal to: 6%/7%/8%/9%/10%\r\nSlow: 50/60/70/80/90 with a 2% increase for every 1% health the enemy is missing as flat move speed reduction, however this cannot exceed a 60% slow\r\nSlow Duration: 2.25/2.5/2.75/3/3.25 seconds\r\nCost: 3% of his maximum health, plus 10/20/30/40/50 if an enemy unit is struck\r\nCool Down: 8 seconds\r\nRange: 1100\r\nProjectile speed: 1600, slowing down over the flight time to a minimum of 1100 \r\nAdditional notes: the self-damage does give Krieg 1 stack on his passive, 3 stacks in total if he hits an enemy.\r\n\r\nSecond Ability: No! Don’t Do It!\r\nKrieg delights in carving his enemies into flesh sculptures, he gains attack damage and movement speed based on his missing health and heals for a percentage of his damage dealt. This is a passive bonus. \r\n\r\nMovement speed gained is equal to 2%/4%/6%/8%/10% of his missing health value\r\nAttack damage gained is equal to 3%/6%/9%/12%/15% of his missing health value\r\nHeal: 2%/3%/4%/5%/6%\r\n\r\nThird Ability: I Hate Numbers\r\nKrieg delivers a massive blow that deals physical damage plus the larger amount between a percentage of the targets attack damage and ability power, or a percentage of the targets armour and magic resist as true damage. Krieg takes damage equal to 15% of the damage dealt. (Adds a stack of Meat Bicycle for both the hit and 2 stacks for the self-damages, for a total of 3 stacks gained). Additionally, the physical damage is increased by a percentage equal to half of the targets combined life steal, spell vampirism and critical chance.  If the total amount of damage dealt does over 10% of the targets maximum health, the target is stunned for 1 second, with 0.5 second increased stun duration for every additional 5% of the targets health damaged in one hit.\r\n\r\nBase Physical Damage: 60/100/140/180/220 plus 35% AD\r\nPercentage of the targets total AD and AP: 10%/15%/20%/25%/30%\r\nPercentage of the targets total armour and magic resist: 12%/16%/20%/24%/28%\r\nRange: 200\r\nCool down: 10 seconds, reduced by 1 second for every 150 health healed through life steal and No! Don’t Do It!\r\nCost: 4% of his current health\r\n\r\nUltimate Ability: Inhuman Rampage\r\nDealing and taking damage charges Inhuman Rampage. When this is activated, Krieg takes 15% more damage from all sources (except for true damage), gains healing effects, gains attack speed, and gets 4x more Meat Bicycle! stacks from all sources for 3 seconds. The duration is increased by 1 second for every unit killed while it is active, and each stack of Meat Bicycle! before casting grants 0.3 seconds of extra duration, additionally the duration is increased by 0.3 seconds for every auto attack dealt and received while this is active. This requires Krieg to take and deal damage 100 times to fully charge this ability and it has no innate cool down. Upon casting, Krieg consumes all 100 points and does not gain any more until the duration is over.\r\n\r\nHealing effects amplification: 40%/50%/60%\r\nAttack speed: 20%/30%/40%\r\nDuration: 4 seconds\r\n\r\nQuotes:\r\nJust about everything Krieg says is yelled or screamed. I don't have this section finished so this is just an example.\r\n\r\nMovement:\r\n-\t“Fine”\r\n-\t“(incomprehensible babbling)”\r\n-\t“I’m going! (yelling incomprehensively)”\r\n-\t“Need more flesh puppets for my merry-go-round”\r\n-\t“I won’t stop! Until they drop!”\r\n-\t“GET OUT OF MY HEAD!”\r\n-\t“There’s no fence on this fence!”\r\n-\t“Why aren’t you stabbing me?”\r\n-\t“I ordered a lead salad!”\r\n\r\n\r\nAttacking: \r\n-\t“I’m not the sick one!”\r\n-\t“OPEN YOUR VEINS!”\r\n-\t“How can I snap your neck if you don’t have one?”\r\n-\t“Now, GO TO SLEEP!”\r\n-\t“I WILL SWALLOW YOUR THROAT!”\r\n-\t“Don’t cry when I pull YOUR LUNGS OUT THROUGH YOUR CHEST!”\r\n-\t“Crack the ribcage to get the goodies”\r\n-\t“SHOOT ME IN THE FACE!”\r\n-\t“WHO WANTS THE FIRST SLICE?”\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon his passive rage reanimation being activated:\r\n-\t“Nobody kills me but ME!”\r\n-\t“I taste blood. Mine AND YOURS!”\r\n-\t“I WILL SCRAPE YOUR FACE FROM MY FINGERNAILS!”\r\n-\t“Salt, good god, WHERE’S MY SALT?!”\r\n-\t“EAT ME!”\r\n\r\n\r\nLore:\r\nKrieg was born into a poor family living in a small stall on the streets of Noxus, barely earning enough money to buy basic necessities. As soon as Krieg could walk, he was working for his father delivering small containers and other insignificant objects to the very few people who would buy such products. At the age of 9, he was now in the works creating these as well as delivering them. Although his parents never admitted it, their business was not going to last much longer in the city of Noxus, and Krieg over time began to realise this. On Krieg’s 13th birthday, Noxian officials had stopped in front of the stall, including Draven, the Glorious Executioner. Krieg had looked up to Draven his entire life, and would often sneak in to the stadium to watch him execute prisoners without his parents knowing, so needless to say, Krieg had developed a few sadistic tendencies. He attempted to approach Draven to admire and praise him, until the officials raised their weapons to stop him. Draven scoffed and said something to his underlings, and before long they had their stall surrounded, and he gave to order to trash it and capture its inhabitants on charges of “loitering”. Krieg, still being outside, watched as all of his belongings; few as they were being destroyed, and the soldiers dragging his parents out as they screamed for mercy. Krieg ran to his mother in an attempt to free her from her oppressors clutches, but was simply swatted away by another soldier. He watched as his parents were dragged to the stadium, and he knew how this would end, yet he still wanted to witness Draven’s handiwork. This was going to be brutal.\r\n\r\nFour years later, Krieg himself was the next prisoner to be used as entertainment for the masses. Caught at the scene of the crime having a tea party with the severed heads of his childhood bullies, he was immediately restrained and sent to the stadium for execution. Through the gates he could hear the crowd breathless in anticipation of Draven’s next brutal kill, and he could hear in the distance the rapid, panicked footsteps of the current runner. It took but three seconds before he heard the sound of heavy metal slicing through flesh, and the pained screams of the victim echoed through the night. From the sound he was making, Krieg guessed that he must have been impaled through either the shoulder or the abdomen. His scream was so lovely, Krieg thought to himself; unfortunately it was soon drowned out in the earth shattering cheering of the crowd. Draven usually allows his victims to bleed on the sand, screaming for a mercy kill, music to Krieg’s ears even now. The gates had opened. It was Krieg’s turn to try to escape, but escape was the last thing on his mind. As he was shoved out of his temporary prison onto the circular desert of the stadium, Krieg thought to himself how smart the designers were to use sand as it slows how fast one can run, but the sand did not continue backwards toward his Glorious Executioner. His handcuffs were released as he was shoved onto the runner’s platform. \r\n\r\nDraven performed his usual superhero stance and announcement to the crowd about how bloody he would make this kill. Krieg turned around on his platform and glared at him, never breaking eye contact. The small shiv he had swallowed before being taken here was growing uncomfortable in his throat, it may have started some internal bleeding, but this only made Krieg angrier. For a moment he could swear he saw fear in the eyes of his former idol, and Krieg waited for the sound to play to tell him to run for his life. It seemed like an eternal wait yet it was only a few seconds, Krieg’s rage was building up rapidly, adrenaline pumping through his veins as if his blood was replaced with magma. There it was. The sound of release. The speed at which Krieg sprinted toward Draven was like a blur to the crowd, and to Draven. Krieg tackled him to the ground before he could even reach his favourite axe. Immediately coughing up the shiv in a mixture of stomach acid and blood from both himself and his bullies, he attempted to stab Draven before his guards got to him, but it was too late. The blade was such a short distance from the flesh, but was stopped before any penetration could be made. He looked to his arm, and it took 3 of Draven’s best guards to stop his momentum. Somehow enraged even further, Krieg released pressure on his downward force, and retaliated on one of the guards by stabbing him in the throat, causing him to slowly choke to death on his own blood. Next, Krieg impaled one of the other guards in the eye, then left the shiv and picked up Draven’s favourite axe. After proceeding to decapitate Draven’s last guard with one swipe, he stared Draven in the eyes until he spotted a hint of true fear, but he did not kill him.\r\n\r\nThis was all the motivation Krieg needed. He escaped Noxus as a so-called psycho, and was forced into entering the League of Legends. Mainly because he was captured by the combined efforts of Galio and Jarvan IV while he was busy creating an iron maiden out of the fresh rib cages of his latest victims. Caged and being made to fight other champions wasn't the worst thing Krieg could have imagined for himself; at least he could still kill. But he never has the time to create art from flesh and bone anymore, which is highly unproductive in his eyes. Soon, he will have all the time he needs.\r\n\r\n“Dead are the days of love and compassion, I am the bloodstain of a demented earth with the purpose of killing. I will scrape the faces off of my enemies and use them as hand towels!” - Krieg\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Zorch Cardinal","date":"2015-01-09T13:56:24.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a blatant ripoff of Krieg from Borderlands 2 - this could never happen due to copyright","replies":[{"poster":"Yuriklatura","date":"2015-01-21T22:42:26.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I said in the godamn post: \n\"I'm basing this guy off the psycho guy DLC character from Borderlands 2.\" \n\nRead things before posting.
