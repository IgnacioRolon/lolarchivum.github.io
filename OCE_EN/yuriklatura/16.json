He has about everything in the game short of an attack speed slow and hard CC apart for his Ultimate, the attack speed reduction being removed last season, yet he goes unnerfed. Just remove his ability to jump to anything that isn't a champion and he drops to the same level of counter play as Master Yi and Tryndamere.","replies":[{"poster":"FreyÃ¤","date":"2015-02-28T12:44:40.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Yuriklatura","date":"2015-03-08T02:38:47.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Master Toph,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-\nid=xQ0EW6EE,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-02-28T12:44:40.239+0000)\n\n> Nerfing his W so it doesn't work on minions will hurt Lee Sin dramatically if he wants to go in a solo lane. I know that I use my minions in lane to evade and gap close when playing Top Lee. Your suggestion would reduce him to a supporting jungler instead of an offensive one. Besides, Kat can E onto friendlies so why can't our favourite blind monk?\n> \n> P.S. When you mentioned counterplay regarding Yi and Tryn, what were you referring to exactly because I don't see how they are relevant to the post.\n\nBecause in a 1v1, Master Yi and Tryndamere are known to have litte counterplay short of hard cc. But with a bit of coordination they get destroyed in team fights but they need to build glass cannon to do so. Lee Sin can build 2 damage items and then tank and outduel both of them, not to mention being able to catch any champion in the game consistently with little to no counterplay as well as having a more impactful team fight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-03-02T01:15:03.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Master Toph,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=xQ0EW6EE,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-02-28T12:44:40.239+0000)\n>\n>Kat can E onto friendlies so why can't our favourite blind monk?\n\nBecause our favourite blind monk uses W (:","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheBadSamaritan","date":"2015-03-07T01:14:00.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He drops off really hard late game though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-02T01:21:40.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you heard the legend of [In Caecus Monachus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA04nbviQ8E)?","replies":[]},{"poster":"SumCoolAid","date":"2015-02-28T11:47:57.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because hes high skill cap relative to other champs.

Yeah no, not with the amount of utility and damage he brings just from being in a fight. A total scrub could play him decently and win against someone goodplaying anyone without an innate escape, or even some champions with escapes.","replies":[{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-03-01T03:23:47.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stfu lmao you're so clueless it hurts my brain reading your low elo sook logic.\n\n*That awkward moment when the only champs you play are the bottom tier skillcap champs that just auto bash %%%% all game.
