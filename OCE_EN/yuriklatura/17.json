I plan on making it quite difficult and risky to play, but equally rewarding. He plays similar to Xerath, in that he has ridiculously long range spells, and just like Xerath, he has no REAL inbuilt escapes apart from flash and is therefore very vulnerable to gap closers and pulls. Due to the nature of his abilities and how long ranged they are, his mana costs are high, and care must be taken to not run out of mana, because the nature of his passive requires you to have mana even to use the summoner spell Flash. In general, a siege god that gets blown up easily who needs extensive levels of vision.\r\n\r\nFor appearance, the Darklurker has four arms, but only uses two in casting spells and melee attacking. It wears a bright white overcoat, and his unused arms are constantly folded as if in a strait jacket. The Darklurker is genderless, and has a shroud of darkness over its hooded face. It is quite tall, but average muscular build. It is also quite slow in almost all actions. The Darklurker is melee.\r\n\r\nAbilities!\r\n\r\nPassive: Dark Barrier\r\nThe Darklurker ignores 30% of all physical and magic damage while channelling abilities before resistances. Additionally, the summoner spell; Flash, has one quarter of its regular cool down, but has a two second channel time that is uncancellable (but can be delayed by stuns, knock ups ETC.) and costs 100 mana. \r\n\r\nFirst Ability: Soul Spear\r\nThe Darklurker channels for 1.2 seconds. After which the ability can be activated again to fire a large projectile in the targeted direction, dealing high magic damage and heavily slowing the first enemy hit. The Darklurker has a 3 second window to fire the projectile after it finishes channelling; if it is not fired, half of the cool down and 30 mana is refunded. During this 3 second period, the defensive bonus from Dark Barrier is applied, and the Darklurker’s movement speed is reduced by 20%. This projectile will pass through minions and monsters if they are killed by the ability and will deal damage to all other enemy units it hits.\r\nThe channel does not stop the Darklurker’s movement, but does slow its movement speed by 75%.\r\nProjectile range: 2000\r\nProjectile speed: 1200, accelerating by 50 for every 100 range travelled. \r\nProjectile width: 180\r\nProjectile length: 300\r\nDamage: 100/140/180/220/260 plus 80% AP\r\nSlow: 70%, decaying down to a minimum of a 30% slow over 4 seconds.\r\nMana cost: 70 mana\r\nCool down: 12 seconds\r\n\r\nSecond Ability: Flame Barrage\r\nThe Darklurker channels for 3 seconds. After 0.5 seconds have passed, The Darklurker can fire three fireballs at any targeted location within a large range, dealing magic damage and lightly slowing a medium area. If two fireballs hit the same unit, that unit takes an additional 40/60/80/100/120 (plus 120% AP) magic damage over 10 seconds. If all three fireballs hit the same unit, that unit is stunned for 1 second. If one or more fireballs are not fired, the cool down begins but 50 mana is refunded. He cannot move until all three fireballs are cast or cancelled. \r\nRange: 1800\r\nRadius: 400\r\nThe projectiles hit the target area equal to 0.7 seconds after casting. \r\nDamage per hit: 50/70/90/110/130 plus 35% AP\r\nSlow: 15% for 1 second.\r\nRate of fire: can fire one fireball every 0.8 seconds. This is reduced by cool down reduction.\r\nCost: 120 mana\r\nCool down: 14 seconds\r\n\r\nThird Ability: Dark Beam\r\nThe Darklurker rises into the air and becomes untargetable, but will still take damage from previously applied DoT (Ignite, Malefic Visions ETC.) for 6 seconds. During this time, the Darklurker cannot move or cast other spells, but instead after 1 second of being airborne it begins firing a dark laser-like beam at the current area of the curser. The laser travels slowly, and only affects a relatively small area of effect. While being damaged by the laser, enemy units are silenced for one second and lightly slowed, with the slow refreshing as long as the enemy is being damaged. The silence can only apply to a champion once, damage applies once per 0.25 seconds, and after the five seconds are over the Darklurker floats back down to the ground and becomes targetable again. It cannot however move or cast spells (except for Flash) from its position for 1.5 seconds after returning to the earth. The Darklurker is visible to both teams while this is casting. \r\nMaximum range: 2800\r\nArea of effect: 180\r\nMagic Damage per tick: 15/20/25/30/35 plus 8% AP\r\nSlow: 8%\r\nThe laser travels at 450 units per second while following the curser\r\nCost: 150 mana\r\nCool down: 20 seconds, begins after the spell is finished\r\n\r\nUltimate Ability: Abyssal Split\r\nAfter a 3 second channel, the Darklurker creates an identical copy of itself. This copy mimics its every ability use, and can be controlled by pressing R with quick cast on, or R right click without. However, regardless of which Darklurker is attacked, the champion will still take damage as a whole as it shares health with its copy. Multiple spells that hit the same enemy deal 50% damage. There are a few special effects if multiple abilities hit the same enemy.\r\nIf two Soul Spears hit the same champion, the target is knocked back 200 range and are stunned for 2.5 seconds.\r\nFlame Barrage no longer stuns on the third hit. Instead, if two hit the target, the DoT is applied as normal, if four hit the target, the slow is tripled in duration, and if all 6 fireballs hit the target, the target is dealt additional DoT (stacking) and is stunned for 1 second.\r\nDark Beam Slows for 12% and silences for double duration. \r\nDuration: 30 seconds\r\nCost: 200 Mana\r\nCool down: 120, begins after the duration ends","replies":[{"poster":"SteamPowerLemon","date":"2015-07-11T08:01:26.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can feel the Dark Souls references.\nJust in case you didn't know the Darklurker is a boss in Dark Souls 2 that is found in the abyss.\nIf you haven't played Dark Souls well done on unintentionally stealing someone else's idea.\n\n;(","replies":[]}]}
