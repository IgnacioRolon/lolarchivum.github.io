{"poster":"Yuriklatura","date":"2014-12-24T00:42:43.760+0000","title":"Eleum Loyce - The Burnt Ivory King","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This champion, directly named after the best boss in the history of video games, is a tanky mixed damage dealer that should be built full tank or AD offtank. He has survivability in lane and in the jungle in terms of free resistances, and can turn the tides of team fights simply by being in the middle of it. His only real counter is true damage, knockbacks and champions with escapes and effective kiting. Also, another counter to him is his weak-ish early game due to him needing time to ramp up in tankiness and damage from his passive.\r\n\r\nHe is a very tall knight, with formerly white armour, now dented and cracked from extended exposure to fire. His spell effects on his second ability and all basic abilities used while it is active however are bright blue magic style. In terms of ability costs, I don’t believe they should cost anything, nor should he have a secondary resource due to his mind (lore wise) being stripped and his physical form being burnt and corrupted by The Old Chaos.\r\n\r\nPassive Ability: Charred Souls\r\nLoyce passively gains maximum health, armour, magic resist and attack speed whenever he kills a unit. The bonus is tripled for killing or assisting in killing champions and killing large minions/monsters. His amount of souls absorbed is shown as a buff on his ability bar.\r\n\r\nHe gains 1 armour and magic resist for every soul absorbed (unit killed) (3 for champions and large monsters). His attack speed is increased by 0.5% and his health is increased by 0.25% per soul. \r\n\r\nFirst Ability: Chaos Reign\r\nUpon activation, Eleum Loyce deals bonus physical damage on his next three basic attacks. Each attack grants a buff to Eleum, and a debuff to his target. The first attack increases Eleum’s movement speed by 15%, and slows the target by an equal amount for 0.8 seconds, dealing a minor amount of physical damage. The second increases Eleum’s attack damage by 30% (applies after this attack, meaning it will only give him bonus damage on his last attack of this combo), and reduces his targets attack damage and attack speed by 10%, and silences them until Eleum attacks them for the third time, dealing moderate physical damage. The third attack causes Eleum to jump to his target as long as they are in 450 range and knocks them back a short distance, dealing moderate physical damage and ignoring 35% of the targets armour. When Eleum jumps into the air, he begins a 0.4 second channel before charging to the target. If Eleum has his second ability active, and the activates this ability, he dashes as normal even if he has already dashed to the target and performs a special attack, attacking a total of two times. The first deals moderate physical damage and slows the target by 20% until he attacks again. The second deals high physical damage and knocks up the target for 1.1 seconds. Each auto attack procs the magic damage bonus from Ivory Sword if it is active.\r\nUnbuffed first attack bonus physical damage: 25/35/45/55/65 plus 20% AD\r\nUnbuffed second attack bonus physical damage: 40/50/60/70/80 plus 40% AD\r\nUnbuffed third attack bonus physical damage (ignores 35% of the targets armour): 40/50/60/70/80 plus 40% AD\r\nEleum has 2 seconds to initiate each attack phase before the buff is lost and is placed on cool down. \r\nBuffed first phase bonus physical damage: 30/40/50/60/70 plus 20% AD\r\nBuffed second phase bonus physical damage: 80/90/100/110/120 plus 40% bonus AD\r\nEleum has 2.5 seconds to initiate each buffed attack phase before the buff is lost and is placed on cool down. \r\nUnbuffed cool down (begins after the last attack is dealt): 18 seconds, reduced by 1 second for every auto attack.\r\nBuffed cool down (begins after the last attack is dealt): 24 seconds, reduced by 1 second for every 2.5% of his maximum health that is lost while Ivory Sword is active.\r\n\r\nSecond Ability: Ivory Sword\r\nEleum Loyce begins an uninterruptable channel for 1.5 seconds, enchanting his sword with magical power. This removes his attack speed, armour, and magic resist bonus, reduces his attack speed by 40%, removes his ability to critical hit, and replaces it with an equal percentage bonus to his attack damage that is calculated after the bonus attack damage gained from this ability is added. It also increases his attack damage, attack range, grants bonus magic damage on-hit, and causes his first basic attack against a target within 550 range to reduce their armour and magic resist, and bring him to the far side of his target. This classifies as an auto attack and procs on hit effects but still does not crit, this dash has a cool down that is reduced based on his maximum health. He can dash to as many targets as he wants while the duration of his buff remains. The dash has a 0.2 second channel time.\r\nFlat attack damage bonus: 10/20/30/40/50\r\nMagic damage bonus on-hit is equal to 35%/40%/45%/50%/55% of his current attack damage. \r\nAttack Range: 190/195/200/205/210\r\nArmour and Magic resist flat reduction on first basic attack while active is equal to Eleum Loyce’s passive armour and magic resist bonus (Eleum still loses the bonuses when this ability is active.)\r\nThe dash can be used on the same target every 7 seconds, reduced by 1 second for every 1000 maximum health. The cooldown on the dash cannot be shorter than 2.5 seconds. \r\nBuff duration: 14 seconds\r\nCost: No Cost\r\nCool down: 28 seconds, begins upon cast\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by an equal percentage, is that his current attack speed bonus from his passive is converted to a % increase in his current attack damage. For example, if Eleum has 35% bonus attack speed, he gains 35% attack damage while this ability is active. \r\n\r\nThird Ability: Skewer/Impale\r\nThis ability is dependent on whether or not Eleum Loyce has his sword buffed.  If he does not have his sword buffed, Skewer is cast. This ability causes Eleum Loyce to channel for 0.5 second, then jam his sword forward in a selected direction. If this strikes an enemy, they are dealt physical damage and snared for 0.6 seconds. They are then dealt true damage based on their missing health over 4 seconds. If his sword is buffed, he channels for 0.7 seconds, then charges forward in a direction, knocking minions and monsters out of his way. If he strikes a champion with his sword, he suppresses them for a total of 1.4 seconds, brings them into the air, then slams them back down, dealing physical damage twice. The enemy champion is kept airborne for a total of 0.6 seconds. His current magic damage bonus on-hit on his second ability applies on this attack. \r\nWidth of Skewer: 55 range\r\nRange of Skewer: 260\r\nPhysical Damage: 50/70/90/110/130 plus 30% AD\r\nTrue damage based on missing health: 12% over 4 seconds\r\nCool Down on Skewer: 11 seconds\r\n\r\nWidth of Impale: 85 range\r\nEleum charges forward a total of 900 range at 1100 units per second\r\nHe can be guided by the mouse (similar to Sion’s ultimate), or an enemy champion can be selected to charge to automatically. This can be dodged quite easily by sidestepping.\r\nMinion and monster knockback damage: 60/80/100/120/140 physical damage plus 50% AD\r\nFirst phase physical damage: 35/50/65/80/95 plus 40% bonus AD\r\nSecond phase physical damage: 20/40/60/80/100 plus 30% AD\r\nRange: 1000/1400/1800/2200/2600\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional notes: This has a special animation and additional effect if Yasuo uses his ultimate ability while a champion is in the air, still impaled on Eleum’s sword. Instead of Yasuo straight up bringing the enemy to the ground after Last Breath finishes casting, Eleum keeps the enemy in the air for an additional 0.4 seconds after Last Breath finishes casting. \r\n\r\nUltimate Ability: The Lost Soldiers of the Ivory King\r\nAfter a 3 second channel time that leaves him unable to move for the duration, Eleum summons three portals to The Old Chaos around him, and soon after which his soldiers, corrupted by fire and insanity, spill forth in random intervals. They are slow, but will attack every nearby enemy with unrelenting fervour. Four types of soldiers can spawn while the portals remain: Sword, Great axe, Great hammer, and Pyromancer. Each soldier has different attack damage, attack speed, movement speed, health, armour, magic resist and special effects. They have infinite aggro range, but will prioritise attacking the nearest units visible to their team; kills made by these units grant the kill gold but not the experience bonus or the bonus for Eleum’s passive. As said above, they have infinite aggro range, but lose stats the further from the portals they travel, down to a minimum of 50% of their base stats. The portals have a set amount of health based on Eleum’s maximum health and the level of the ability, and the soldiers have a percentage of Eleum’s statistics based on the type of soldier they are. The portals last until they are destroyed. \r\n3 random types of soldiers (however it will only summon 3 unique types initially), are summoned as soon as the portals become active.  After which a random type of soldier will be summoned at a random time between 5 – 10 seconds. There is no limit to how many soldiers can be summoned at a time, because they should die before they become overwhelming. \r\nThe Sword soldier attacks 1.4 times per second, has 15% of Eleum’s maximum health, has 40% of Eleum’s unbuffed attack damage, has 60% of Eleum’s movement speed, and 30% of his armour and magic resist. He deals 60% bonus damage to minions and takes 20% less champion damage. For every 1% bonus attack speed that Eleum Loyce has, the Sword Soldiers gain 0.25% increased attack speed.\r\nThe Great Axe soldier attacks 0.9 times per second, has 22% of Eleum’s maximum health, has 60% of Eleum’s unbuffed attack damage, has 40% of Eleum’s movement speed, and 45% of his armour and magic resist. He takes 30% less damage from minions and turrets and deals 40% more damage to champions and large minions/monsters. For every 1 bonus armour and magic resist Eleum has when his sword is unbuffed, the Great Axe gains 0.2 Armour and Magic resist.\r\nThe Great Hammer soldier attacks 0.6 times per second, has 18% of Eleum’s maximum health, has 75% of Eleum’s unbuffed attack damage, has 35% of Eleum’s movement speed, and 28% of his armour and magic resist. He deals triple damage to turrets, but takes 20% more champion damage.\r\nThe Pyromancer soldier attacks 0.4 times per second, has 12% of Eleum’s maximum health, has 30% of Eleum’s unbuffed attack damage, has 50% of Eleum’s movement speed, and 17% of his armour and magic resist. He deals 200% of Eleum’s attack damage as physical damage over 2 seconds, and his attack speed is increased to 1 attack per second when more than one target is in range. This damage over time applies to turrets. Additionally, if an enemy is within melee range of the Pyromancer, (200 range) he casts a different spell that does not cause a damage over time but instead deals 300% of Eleum’s unbuffed attack damage semi - instantly. He does not retain the attack speed bonus however. \r\nThe soldiers have their full stats while they are within 2200 range of the portals. After which their stats degrade at a rate of 1% every 20 range. \r\nThe portals have 25%/35%/45% of Eleum’s maximum health.\r\nCool down: 360 seconds, reduced by 1 second for every minion/monster kill or assist made by the soldiers. The cool down is reduced by 1 second for every auto attack dealt to towers from either Eleum or his soldiers. The cool down is reduced by half of its current cool down if the portals are destroyed. There is no limit to how many portals can be active.\r\nAdditional notes:  The portals are visible to both teams at all times. If the portals are being attacked, the soldiers are produced at a rate of 1 soldier every 3 – 4 seconds. Enemy champions attacking the portals while in tower range draws tower agro. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou are probably thinking that that ultimate is \r\nA)\tOverpowered\r\nB)\tStupid\r\nC)\tAnswers A and B\r\nD)\tAnswers A, B and C\r\n\r\nHold up a sec, because yeah it gives permanent map pressure, but in a team fight, unless he can cast it during or just before the fight, he essentially has no ultimate to use to assist himself or his team. Now of course, you can just cast it in your base and the soldiers will just keep spawning and pushing the closest lane with no counter play other than killing them, but again, the soldiers are unlikely to assist in a team fight and are going to be so far from the portals that they are slow and weak anyway. \r\nBalanced. \r\n\r\n\r\nQuotes!\r\nAs will be explained in the lore, The Ivory King was once a proud king that was benevolent in his rule. However, when the fires of chaos threatened his kingdom from deep below the earth, he and his faithful Loyce knights charged fearlessly into The Old Chaos, but were overwhelmed by the intense fire and insanity of its very air. That’s the Sparknotes of the lore, so let’s do some quotes.\r\nHe is insane, a shell of his former self. His VO should be slow, deep and echo-y, similar to Sion and Nautilus. \r\nMovement: \r\n-\t“Where… must kill…”\r\n-\t“Nothing left…”\r\n-\t“Set… to destroy”\r\n-\t“Who… am I”\r\n-\t“This burden… no… can’t remember”\r\n-\t“My mind… is gone”\r\n-\t“Where… am I?”\r\n-\t“I have… nothing”\r\n-\t“I cannot… feel… anything”\r\n-\t“I see fire… and darkness”\r\n\r\nAttacking:\r\n-\t“Kill… KILL!”\r\n-\t“Burn… flesh”\r\n-\t“Consume… and destroy”\r\n-\t“Death… a gift… for you”\r\n-\t“Sever… the spine”\r\n-\t“Return… to nothingness”\r\n-\t“The Old Chaos… calls to… YOU!”\r\n-\t“For… the daemon heir”\r\n-\t“Stop screaming!”\r\n-\t“Await… oblivion”\r\n\r\nRandomly upon gaining a stack of Charred Souls\r\n-\t“Fuel… the flame”\r\n-\t“Flame… dear flame”\r\n-\t“I… will consume… all”\r\n\r\nCasting Skewer and striking an enemy champion:\r\n-\t“Bleed…”\r\n-\t“Be silent… just stay here and…bleed”\r\n-\t“I will… must… end you”\r\n\r\nCasting Impale and striking an enemy champion:\r\n-\t“You… cannot run from me”\r\n-\t“Feel the sting of… fire”\r\n-\t“Get… over here”\r\n\r\nBuying a Vampiric Sceptre or Doran’s Blade:\r\n-\t“It will… sustain me”\r\n\r\nBuying a Sunfire Cape:\r\n-\t“Incineration… more”\r\n-\t“More fire”\r\n\r\nBuying a Warmog’s Armour\r\n-\t“Indestructible”\r\n\r\nBuying a Bloodthirster:\r\n-\t“Blood… and fire”\r\n-\t“My power… strengthens”\r\n\r\nBuying a Spirit Visage:\r\n-\t“No magic… can kill me”\r\n\r\nBuying a Zephyr:\r\n-\t“Speed… good”\r\n-\t“Faster… FASTER!”\r\n\r\nJoke:\r\n-\t“I can’t… remember… anything”\r\n-\t“This sword… is getting heavier”\r\n-\t“Joke… happiness… foreign…”\r\n\r\nTaunt:\r\n-\t“To kill… or not (pause)must kill”\r\n-\t“Your termination is your salvation”\r\n\r\nTaunting Anivia:\r\n-\t“Wait, I know you.”\r\n\r\nTaunting Gangplank:\r\n-\t“Curved swords.

His kingdom was just, there was no corruption or violence to plague their streets unlike their neighbouring cities. But yet, an ancient chaos that had existed since time immemorial, was stirring beneath the earth. The honourable king, vowing to defend his people from the horrors it would emanate, had created a portal to the chaos, not of magic or science, but of a crack in the earth deep enough to take one into the heart of The Old Chaos itself. He assembled his brave knights, warriors who would follow their king to their death with pride, and they charged headfirst into the chaos. But they found no enemy. No war to fight, only the scorching heat of insanity. One by one, the Knights of Eleum Loyce fell to the darkened power of the fire within the earth, losing their mind and attacking themselves, then one another, until only their king remained.\r\n\r\nBut these are only the stories told by the few who knew of the phenomenon that consumed the city. No one knows the true story of the Ivory King and his Knights. Perhaps they sacrificed themselves in an attempt to save the city? Perhaps they wanted to embrace the darkness? Perhaps the king became too proud of the kingdom he built and was ignorant of the obvious power in The Old Chaos? No man can say for certain, for no soul truly knows what happened in Eleum Loyce. But whatever it was, the League of Legends had to step in immediately to contain the city and its king. They successfully captured Eleum Loyce, owing to the fact he was still partially immobilised. He was forced into the blood sport of the League of Legends, because it was the only way to keep him occupied, keep him distracted from his now bloodthirsty mentality. The Old Chaos was isolated by the power of Anivia, freezing the city and the fire it holds with it. But the fire of the chaos is powerful, and cannot remain trapped forever. There is another being that makes its home in this place; and he wants to be free.\r\n\r\n“Eleum Loyce was subdued, and his broken city frozen in time. But there is something else here, some greater power remains even though its source is welded by cold. I have heard tales of a daemon heir, and if these rumours are true, we will need to be prepared for his arrival. ” – Anivia\r\n\r\n\r\nThis part of the lore is hinting at my other champion who is directly related to this one.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Ryz","date":"2015-01-26T07:29:13.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok so, when u use Q, the next 3 basic attacks, the first one will do some dmg and adding a marker ( you could say ) to that champ, with an increase of move speed, the 2nd attack is will do extra dmg silencing the enemy champ and receiving 10% less dmg from that champ, the 3rd basic attack is a leap towards the target dealing dmg ignoring 35% of its Armour and knocking them back, if 2nd ability is active it dashes towards the target performing a special move, slowing them for 20%\n\nthe Q is really confusing and long so i think my description for Q is simple, the q seems really op. For W is the targets Armour, etc etc or is it the users stats. E is really op also especially in duels between melee champs, R is just full on op hvng up to 4 solders with different abilities to go down the lane and just kill. \n\nthis is really long and confusing but if u take your time and slowly read it, this is a really op champ","replies":[]}]}
