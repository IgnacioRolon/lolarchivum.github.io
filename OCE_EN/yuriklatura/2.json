I would like to suggest a small rework that rewards her offensively when she builds defensively. Similiar to Vladimir&#039;s passive.\n\nNEW PASSIVE:\n\nDragonborn\n\nShyvanna deals bonus physical damage on hit based on her armour and magic resist. Additionally, Shyvanna gains bonus armour and magic resist based on her armour and magic resist.\n\nBonus physical damage dealt on every auto attack is equal to 10%/15%/20% of Shyvanna&#039;s total armour and magic resist.\n\nShyvanna&#039;s armour and magic resist is increased by 1 for every 10/7.5/5 bonus armour and magic resistance.","replies":[]}
