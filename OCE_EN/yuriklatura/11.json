Vayne's old W have a base damage and now the base damage has been removed. Vayne old W did  60 + 8% max health true dmg and now it does 12% max health true dmg with no base dmg at all. This is a nerf to vayne's dmg against squishy champions and a buff against high health targets. \n\nHere some math:\nTarget 1:1000 health\nold vayne dmg: 140 true dmg\nNew Vayne Dmg:120\n\nTarget 2: 1200 health \nold vayne dmg: 156 true dmg\nNew Vayne Dmg: 144 true dmg\n\nTarget 3: 1500 hp\nold vayne dmg: 180\nnew vayne dmg: 180\n\nTarget 3: 2000hp \nold vayne dmg: 220 true dmg\nNew Vayne Dmg: 240 True dmg\n\nTaget 4: 2500hp \nold vayne dmg: 260\nnew vayne dmg:300\n\nThese changes are obviously changes to make Vayne more of a tank Killer than someone who kills both squishies and tanks.  Honestly i feel that this is a significant nerf to vayne's early levels and her laning phase is a lot weaker now thanks to this change. Other than that her AD growth has been nerf by quite a lot. Other than that vayne's biggest core item the Blade of ruined king has been nerfed. Overall this is a huge nerf to vayne's dmg early game to mid game wise and only when it gets to mid-late game stage will vayne start to do dmg. One last thing to take note of is that most of vayne's counters have received some form of buffs such as the buff to caitlyn, small buff to Draven, and even buffs to Graves. Vayne is a lot weaker right now than what you think she is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-11-11T14:25:53.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes lol I walk in with Cait after she's on a trap with headshot and an energized (Rapid Fire cannon) attack that crits and do 800 Damage to her instantly while she only has 1400 HP. (That's lvl 14 with only IE and rapid fire cannon).\n\nShe actually sorta became weaker with the AD items because most of them are crit oriented, she only really has so much crit synergy until late game so she probably needed that kinda buff, although I havent played as a tank against her yet so havent experienced the pain but Vayne's always been a menace but the ADC items made most of them a lot more powerful than her so this change was probably necessary and Vayne is relatively squishy and buying a BT on her is not often easy, so she can get burst down in team fights mid game quite easily but if it makes it to late game, just like old school Vayne she'll probably stomp 2v4s and occasional team fights like she always has.\n\nP.S her synergy with Deaths Dance and Rapid Fire Cannon is also limited, so when it comes to the new items she missed a lot of love that some of the other ADCs got.\n\nMight be over the top but realistically, a lot of her damage comes from having like 60 bonus AD from her ulti, her base AD and her attack speed and the chunks of damage from Silver Bolts are less influential to her dominance against AP's and ADCs than it is for her against tanks, although she got Lord Dominik's Regards which could help her smash tanks. Are you saying she's a bit strong vs tanks, or other ADCS and APs and Supports and squishyish junglers or bruisers/assassins?\n\nShe'll take longer to get rolling than she used to so there are windows to exploit power against her but even late game without Last Whisper like it used to be, she'll be more oriented on fighting tanks than ever so all in all she shouldn't be causing a problem and the new Last Whisper passive gives other ADCs more strength mid game and even in some cases late game, than her.","replies":[{"poster":"CyanPhoenix","date":"2015-11-11T15:42:10.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"agreed. They've really buffed up her tank-destroying ability, especially with the new last whisper upgrades etc, but overall i feel like she will be a little bit weaker, especially against bursty/poke teams.\n\nalso Death's Dance would have really good synergy with her, being able to stay alive longer to dish out more AAs is a plus all around. :p","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-11-11T15:58:05.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah but she doesn't get the AD scaling from it that other Champs do, hers is limited and she doesn't get as much benefit from the CDR as say a cait or something.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
