For champions like Aatrox, (whom I have been playing a bit lately and enjoy him quite a bit), BoRK is the essential item for him, and if you are winning lane so hard that you can afford to build more damage, you really have no options that give attack speed and damage without other useless stats like crit strike or ability power. I had an item concept in mind that I did a while ago and never posted it. That said, I pretty much made it for Aatrox.\r\n\r\n350 health\r\n65% attack speed\r\n55 attack damage\r\n14% lifesteal\r\nUNIQUE PASSIVE: Blood Healing\r\nAutoattacks restore 0.6% of your maximum health every successful hit. This heal increases by 0.05% every proc up to a maximum of 1.2% maximum health restore. Stacks decay after not autoattacking for 9 seconds, and decay by 5 stacks every decay proc.\r\n\r\nBuild Path:\r\nJaurim&#039;s Fist\r\nTwo Daggars\r\nTwo Vampiric Scepters\r\n\r\nCombine cost: 150 gold\r\nTotal Cost: 3750 gold","replies":[{"poster":"VeganCrossfitter","date":"2016-02-04T11:40:12.805+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"An item like that would be too strong, ad carries and basically any other champ who relies on ad would jump on that, imagine this on a {{champion:67}} , or {{champion:202}} now.","replies":[{"poster":"Yuriklatura","date":"2016-02-04T11:59:37.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RomeoPM,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=Ld0dhWUH,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-02-04T11:40:12.805+0000)\n>\n> An item like that would be too strong, ad carries and basically any other champ who relies on ad would jump on that, imagine this on a {{champion:67}} , or {{champion:202}} now.\n\nFirst off, it is the second most expensive item in the game, and it does not give all stats that an adc would enjoy having. I can only see this being used on Vayne, but still, the passive would be next to useless because an adc would never itemise for health except for maybe a 5th item. It gives decent lifesteal and attack damage yes, but only 55 as opposed to an infinity edge or an essence reaver, both of which give all stats that an adc would find use for. I can see your concern, but no smart adc would buy this as a first or second item except for Vayne.","replies":[{"poster":"VeganCrossfitter","date":"2016-02-04T16:00:55.730+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The health gives that extra survivability in lane, and as any adc i could think of it would be super op, like guinsoo is on jax . and for that amount of gold those stats are pretty high, imagine building 6 of these just for the base stats, you  would reach max atk speed,  do around 420 dmg per aa, and heal for 72% of dmg done, while having around 3k health. pretty op","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Yuriklatura","date":"2016-02-07T06:25:03.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I stated. It's an item CONCEPT. The numbers are too high/too low because I didn't really do too much math on the offensive buffs. Either way, good feedback.

Jungle wise he is sorted with devourer but since Zephyr was removed theres not many strong options when you only want maybe two damage items.\nThe item you came up with seems OP, its like a triforce style item but gives insanely high values. The attack speed alone is crazy, and the amount this would heal would be ridiculous with that passive. ATM this would definitely be a purchase for an ADC that relies more on basic attacks than abilities and would be OP on champions like {{champion:24}} {{champion:39}} while possibly being broken on champs like {{champion:106}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:19}}  due to the stats just being so high.\n\nOverall I like the idea, would be great for {{champion:56}} as well, however its just too strong, a jack of all trades item excelling in all aspects.\n\nTry coming up with some new stats and it might look attractive to others as an idea!","replies":[]}]}
