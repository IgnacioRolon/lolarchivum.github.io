But, whenever I play a champion with a channeled ability, for example Sion Q or Varus Q, my ping escalates to anywhere between 200 to 400 ping for about 2 seconds after the ability expires/cast. I have isolated it to only a few champions, pretty much anyone with an ability with a variable timing, and some champions regardless of ability style. I don&#039;t know the cause, but it definitely only happens on the cast of a few abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-01-01T13:48:07.329+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could you try [repairing or forcing a re-patch of your client](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues#wq5)?

Forcing a re-patch didn't work, and most of the points on the Connection Troubleshooting guide either don't work or don't really apply, because what I have is a severe case of selective lag instead of regular random lag spikes. Firewalls are set to let League of Champions through, and I am out of ideas apart from just not playing champions with channelled abilities. Which is incredibly annoying. Cheers for the help though, was worth a shot.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-01-02T19:18:31.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> most of the points on the Connection Troubleshooting guide either don't work or don't really apply\n\nMy suggestion is to try the other steps even if you don't think it'll work.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
