I did notice that I was taking more damage than I should be, so maybe it deals the Grasp of the Undying effect to yourself which makes little sense. I did get Titanic Hydra in each game as well so it might have some interaction with that too. Mostly it happens on the second Q proc, but sometimes happens a couple auto&#039;s after.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-01-07T21:15:20.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teemo Bug:\n\nI noticed this while in-game.\n\n1.
