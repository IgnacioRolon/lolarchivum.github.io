I was up against Garen, and so you can imagine I was pretty upset in the load screen. However, despite dying twice to ganks by their jungler throwing spears from under my screen while I was under tower, I still managed to rack up 400 stacks by 20 minutes, and around 950 stacks by the end of the game. But that&#039;s not what this post is about.\n\nIn bot lane, about 3 minutes before our loss, I caught out their fed as fuck Draven. As you can imagine, I two shotted him with around 4/5ths of my health left. Then Garen and the rest of their team popped up to fiddle my diddle, which I knew was gonna happen anyway.\n\nAll of a sudden, Garen ults me for 1505 true damage. \nOne. \nThousand. \nAnd five. \nTrue. \nDamage. \n\nWhy in the shit, does any champion, let alone a TANK, possess an ability that not only only does percentage missing health damage, but percentage missing health TRUE damage. \n\nTRUE DAMAGE HAS NO COUNTER. WHY IS THERE NO ITEM OR MASTERY OR RUNE OR EVEN A FUCKING SKIN TO COUNTER IT. LOOKING AT YOU VAYNE.\n\nWhat am I supposed to do in that situation? Even if I wasn&#039;t caught out the fact that I could be executed for losing less than half my health is just downright doggy doo doo.\n\nWith a lot of the item&#039;s this season, I feel like Riot really hates tanks. There&#039;s 1 item to directly counter auto attack/critical strike reliant champions, and 2 total for just attack speed reduction. Yet 11 items exist that counter tankyness in some way, be it flat/percentage armour/magic penetration, healing reduction, percentage health bonus damage etc.\n\nNot a fan of being a 7.5k health big boy Sion and taking 3k true damage from a Vayne looking in my general direction, or getting shredded by just about any ability power champion just because they have a Void Staff.\n\nBeing able to deal true damage or buying a single item should not just almost nullify three items.\n\nFix true damage and tank shredding items please.","replies":[{"poster":"Numpty","date":"2016-08-17T04:33:22.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Garens damage is the same as most top laners like Darius or Fiora \n\nIf Darius has no items and procs his passive on you, at level 18 he gets 200 bonus ad. His ultimate all up will do 780 true damage with no items. With black cleaver it takes it to 825 true damage.\n\nFiora ult, which is also a % max hp damage (assuming you have around 3,000 hp and she as 200ad from bc, hydra and bt) will deal 1320 true damage\n\nNow garen doesn't have the armor pen of Darius or the mobility of fiora but his damage is at least comparable  to most the other toplaners.\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Anubis Unbound,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=rYOHEfWx,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-08-07T12:01:41.876+0000)\n or getting shredded by just about any ability power champion just because they have a Void Staff.\n\n\nThis is how its suppose to be though, you build tank and they do nothing to you until they build some sort of penetration. The issue is around the cost of these items. For example the upgrade of  last whisper will reduce you're % damage reduction by 45% for less than  most armor items (excluding thornmail since you need to couple that with hp, hence more cost)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Corehog","date":"2016-08-08T07:44:09.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is a counter to true damage, it's more health.\n\nGaren's ult deals a base amount of damage and 40% of the targets missing health as magic damage. The ult damage is converted into True Damage if the target is the \"Villain\".\n\nIf the target is the \"villain\", they receive 1% of their max health as damage per auto attack or each rotation of his E.\n\nAlso, Garen can not choose who is the \"Villain\", it is automatically assigned to the enemy champ who has the most amount of kills in the last 5 minutes (so really, you've got no-one to blame but yourself :P)","replies":[]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-08-07T12:40:01.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have over 100k exp on garen and I can tell you Garens only weapon is true damage.

There are counters to it, as there are counters for every champion. You were unlucky to be matched up against him, but you can't say it is unbalanced, when you're playing a champ with 2sec cooldowns on an ability that can do incredible amount of damage.\n\nGaren is different than Nasus. Learn his weakness, use it against him or safely farm until you can do something against him. His true damage is not always up against you, so chillax and expect to lose 1v2s, 1v3s and 1v4s, especially when their team compo is against you. \nThere are other ways to be helpful on the rift, beyond getting kills :)\nGood luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-08-07T14:52:52.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There should not be %hp true damage, you can at least build hp on normal true damage like chos ult, but %hp stuff is uncounterable. thornmail should counter damage dealt, instead of physical damage dealt, but, rioters like vayne and fiora so they wont deal with the issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-08-07T13:30:48.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">or getting shredded by just about any ability power champion just because they have a Void Staff.\n\nThis is my only personal problem with playing any sort of tank, is that if their AD/Mid have a brain my 300+ Armor/MR is going to turn into nothing.\n\nHad an Ashe recently who did 2k damage in 3 seconds through 300 armor (from her tickling me just before) simply because she bought her fucking pen item.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-08-07T12:16:14.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest, I'm not sure if Garen would even be viable as a pick without his passive. Also Garen's ult also mainly deals magic damage but this becomes true damage only if you're the villain. Basically what this means is that Garen is only a threat to nasus when nasus is the villain late game that is. Early on Garen is a straight up lane bully, Nasus's greatest weakness and would utterly wreck him during laning phase. \n\nGaren's kit effectively makes him predictable, he loses in a lot of match ups, and in match ups where he is favourable he can still be outplayed due to the binary nature of Garen. This actually makes it more difficult to play Garen against seasoned players but more rewarding at the same time. \n\nJust avoid fighting Garen at all costs if you're the villain. ","replies":[]}]}
