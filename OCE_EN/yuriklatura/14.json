You buy armour and magic resist to counter enemy physical and magic damage. Yet, 10 minutes later, that Yasuo crits you for 640, and that Xerath deals 480 damage in one q when before they did very little to damage you. The role of a tank is to soak up damage and throw out tons of CC so that the damage dealers can do their job with little to no risk or effort. How am I supposed to soak up damage or throw out said tons of CC if I die within 4 seconds of initiating a fight? I will die for my team to survive any day of the week, but when I die having achieved nothing due to my defenses being almost completely bypassed before I can do anything useful, that is not fun.\r\n\r\nLast Whisper and Void Staff are ridiculous items. Not only do they allow a champion to almost bypass your hard earned armour and magic resist, but they give said champion even more attack damage/ability power. The penetration needs to be converted to flat penetration to give us tank mains some breathing room.","replies":[{"poster":"Lost In Time","date":"2015-02-04T09:20:29.033+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah how about doing the math with no bonus armor/mr vs LW/VS and then the math with armor/mr vs LW/VS and get back to me.\n\n(hint: it's still worth building resistances)","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-02-04T06:52:27.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"armour pen maybe, but magic pen is fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-02-04T06:11:40.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're fine, they do need to make more magic resist items though, should bring back Force of Nature tbh.","replies":[]}]}
