Or had it in the past and fixed it? It&#039;s happening almost daily and if I get on top of it sometimes I can reconnect, It just sucks &#039;leave buster&#039; only sees the afk and not the reasoning behind it. Alas, now its a 20 minute wait to connect for me and my friends because of something out of my controll /sigh.","replies":[]}
