I would love for it to be available for more time each week as it is very popular and queue times are always good. Even if it was for an extra day or two per week it would be amazing. Would love to hear if there was more who want this to happen and whether we can get enough support from riot to do it. \r\nThanks guys.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-08T08:54:50.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but if you put in more days for twisted treeline...
