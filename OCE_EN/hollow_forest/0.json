I asked a friend to spectate *using the freaking LoL client* and we could have won if this stupid bug wasn't there to ruin it. \r\n\r\nNot only that, I could be sent to the low priority queue or some suspension because of the game's own fault. **This bug has been around for a really long time and riot is just ignoring it**.\r\n\r\nMy internet is fine, and I did absolutely everything I could for the game to work. I even did what you're thinking of telling me that I should have done. I did that, too. \r\n\r\nThis game is riddled with game breaking bugs. One gets fixed, two more come out. I know that its practically impossible for a big game like LoL to be bug free but having a bug like this being around for *litterally years* is not good.\r\n\r\nI will now probably be waiting 20 minutes in low priority queue for a game to start.
