It seems from what I've been experiencing from playing on the OCE side and talking to League of Legends fans, there isn't a large enough community in this region.  This can be due to the lack of transparency RIOT has in Australia, the smaller population of the area as opposed to the other highly populated ones.  I have to do more research on the community in Australia and see what kind of events are made for League fans and what kind of methods RIOT uses to promote League of Legends.  On another note, there have also been numerous amount of Bots on the OCE server playing in CO-OP vs AI games, which I've never seen on NA.  This made it very frustrating to play and I can see how it would effect the overall gameplay for new comers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SwigidySwooty","date":"2016-08-08T00:24:17.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This needs to be back, you should make it before a new level 30 can play ranked they have to have played atleast 10 games of normal draft mode.\nAlso if you make this available for people that are level 20 + it will really help lower levels understand the pick and ban rate and how to prepare for ranked. {{champion:79}} {{item:3073}} {{item:3073}} {{item:3073}} {{item:3073}} {{item:3073}} {{item:3073}} {{item:3073}} {{item:3073}}  PLS RITO","replies":[]}]}
