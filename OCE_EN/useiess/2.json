But I find it a little unfair for ap champs when facing ad as ad champs have higher ad and their abilitys tend to scale of ad. Where as ap champs have ap scaling abilitys but nothing to boost basic attacks. I know this would be hard to incorporate and might just be stupid. Just food for thought. This would require a teemo rework","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-12-26T11:19:21.841+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is very stupid. If auto-attacks scale of AP then it wont be any different to AD. Might as well just remove AP from the game and make all champions AD.\n\nAP champions have weak auto-attacks but better ability scaling than AD champions. They do deal more auto-attack damage with AP BTW, but only against turrets. If it was any other way, AP would be extremely broken.","replies":[{"poster":"UseIess","date":"2015-12-27T11:13:00.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely agree with telecasterdude who the heck came up with this stupid idea!","replies":[]},{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-12-26T13:16:21.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed, plus ap champs tend to be ranged rather than melee.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2015-12-26T17:10:32.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ranged? ap champs tend to be ability driven is what you meant right.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-12-27T05:26:48.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No shit.
