I feel though he has too much health on his turrets and they deal too much damage, I feel that it is to easy to get them out and keep them out as the out range many champs and are quite hard to target. As teemo lvl 1 bs heimer lvl 1 it took 4 shots to kill 1 turret.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-12-27T06:09:18.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He falls off heavily late game.

Remember to clear them before engaging on their team, or bait the upgraded turret and disengage. The key to beating a Heimerdinger is not playing his game and destroying those turrets whenever possible.","replies":[]}]}
