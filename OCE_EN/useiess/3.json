When looking over {{champion:267}} Nami I noticed that her ult had been called tidal wave. But did you know that another name for a tidal wave is a tsunami!!!!! So what I propose is that Rito changes the ult name to Tsu-Nami!!! Because who doesn&#039;t love a good pun aye? Also anyone else feel that teemo{{champion:17}}  should have the damage on his shrooms buffed? Please comment if you agree. Thank you summoners and long live the mighty Veigar! {{champion:45}}","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-11-30T08:30:00.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i r8 8/8 m8","replies":[]},{"poster":"UseIess","date":"2015-11-29T21:53:47.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"God dammit.
