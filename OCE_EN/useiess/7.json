This means your team is favoured to win the game, this is because the matchmaking system is  testing to see if you can keep your bronze 4 rank. Once you have won enough games, and the system thinks you are in your deserved rank, then you will be match evenly/unfavourably so the system can test if you are ready to go up to the next rank (normal/High MMR). When this happens you will see your LP gain/loss becoming the same or even more Lp for winning.\n\nFocus on improving your game, not your rank. Rank will come when you have improved your game, on the flip side, focusing on your rank will only make you angry/tilt/blame others.\n Good Luck{{summoner:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"UseIess","date":"2016-09-24T05:30:18.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok but i have higher mr than the average in my league, so shouldnt it even out?","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-24T06:16:41.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"unfortunately quite the opposite. If you want to climb quickly, having a low mmr compared to your teammates gives you more lp but also is counteracted by your mmr rising quickly to match it. So long as you keep winning consecutively on a new account, it's possible to ride this wave up pretty high in terms of elo but eventually as your winrate evens out as games get harder the flow ebbs.\nYeah your mmr is like bronze 2 at the moment which means the climb is going to be slow, especially since you'll be matched with other bronze 4 players and they'll have lower mmr than yours. This is why it takes more time to climb when in low elo and in high elo as well. It's to do with the way lp works and the standard bell curve.","replies":[{"poster":"UseIess","date":"2016-09-26T02:35:20.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for the help man","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2016-09-18T06:27:27.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">The (presumed, not official basics).\n\n>You win games, your MMR goes up\nYou lose games, your MMR goes down\nMMR determines who you are matched against (mmr= match making rating)\nYou win against a team with more MMR than yours, maybe you get more LP (and vice versa).\n\nGenerally, if you have a low win rate (yours is currently at 44%, you will have pretty bad MMR and will be losing more LP than you are gaining.
