The attack speed generally helps Yi a lot. I can't remember the name but **if and only if your team has enough cc**, you can consider swaping Stalker's Blade with the Red Hunter's machete upgrade (the one that uses smite to mark a champion then does true damage on hit for 6 seconds) that combined with E can whack a lot of true damage. But really it's all situational, you do have a fair point as Warrior gives your Q a lot more damage potential, but personally I think the attack speed early is good since you have your E to make up for damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mariius","date":"2015-01-10T07:33:11.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Knuuckles,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=ZNlA5Z1O,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-10T06:59:21.527+0000)\n>\n> just take a break man no use forcing yourself to play while your clearly tilting play a different game or some arams if you wanna play\n\ncompletely agree with that. you may very well be on tilt. Also, don't stress out! Checked your mmr from op.gg, it says it's normal. You won't drop to bronze unless  your mmr is a full tier below silver, which is very unlikely. There's a reason you're in Silver believe it or not the match making system is fairer than most people think. And also, I think your Master Yi may find Devourer (the new Feral Flare) more useful as a Stalker's Blade enhancement. \n\nEveryone's had those moments, once I lost 26 games in a row, which included ranked, normals, aram, **AND EVEN A CUSTOM GAME AGAINST BEGINNER BOTS!** (i afked so they won but still it was sad) The point is you'll realise that once you get out of this phase you're suddenly a much better player. \n\nGood luck","replies":[{"poster":"ZeusXXXXXX","date":"2015-01-10T07:37:48.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the advice guys... Hope I get out of Tiltland soon...\n\nWhat's the reasoning between devourer and warrior? Warrior is a more team fighting enchant and I usually group to avoid being picked off, and I find that it's better for my team if I don't farm the whole game.","replies":[]}]}]}
