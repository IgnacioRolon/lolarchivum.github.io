So I played them, won 4 games and was placed in silver 3. From then on, it just all went downhill. I was demoted to silver 4 today. I was just wondering if this is something I should be worried about (because I am) and whether I really do belong in silver. I've been playing Master Yi jungle most of the time, since he is my main. But now I'm playing ranked, I've started doing really bad with him. I just always manage to suicide and lose the game. My teammates never listen to me either. All advice is welcome. My summoner name is ZeusXXXXXX if you want to check out my profile on LolKing or something.","replies":[{"poster":"gimble","date":"2014-12-26T00:45:32.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You did the similar thing to what I did. Hit 30, played norms for a bit, then provisionals landed me in B1... managed to climb to S5 (prob carried by others ;))... My champ pool was small (4-5 champs)... and I dropped... hard... all the way to B5.\nLast 2 months... have learnt a few more champs... and have climbed to B1 again... much more confident playing all roles with multiple champs.\nMy advice... ride your wave down to where you 'belong', it will make for much more enjoyable games... learn new (fun... not necessarily 'OP') champs... and climb as your skill improves. Don't worry so much about your 'rank'... just how you play... improve CS, objective control, map awareness, etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2014-12-25T11:23:33.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL 4-6 in provisionals and got Siver 3? I went 3-7 and got Bronze 2. Theres a couple things right now you should consider.\n\n1. Its preseason so ranked doesnt mean that much right now\n2. Its ok to have a Main champion, but don't blind pick only them. Sometimes that champion simply wont work against the enemy team.\n3. Focus on each game and how you played rather than what rank you currently are. Don't worry about your rating.\n\nI think the reason you are finding ranked a lot harder is because people are actually trying whereas in normals people just mess around usually or play champions they normally wouldn't just for practice etc...\n\nYou sound very similar to me when I started ranked and dealing with the same things I am. Right now, im working on expanding my champion pool.\nI recently purchased Irelia because I was told by everyone thats she's super strong and borderline OP. But i simply don't have fun playing her so I don't think I will be using her in ranked. Its about finding champs that are strong. but you also have fun with.\n\n **Remember this isn't a job its a game, so playing champions you hate just to climb ranks is pretty weird way to have fun in a game**","replies":[{"poster":"ZeusXXXXXX","date":"2014-12-25T11:28:37.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is... I've been playing master Yi, cait and Zed since I was level 15 or so and they're the only champions I can play. And unfortunately for me they are countered easily or they fail when you are behind. Who should I learn? Should I still be playing Yi? That's my question now.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2014-12-25T12:33:43.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yi is fine, he can solo carry games. But the thing with Yi is you have to understand that you are trusting your team in the early game to not lose and if they do lose they will rage at you since your a Yi, who just likes to farm early and not gank much.\nIts just if they have more than 2 champs with a stun or root I wouldn't pick him since if he gets cc'd he dies very quickly and you become useless.\n\nIf you like Yi (farm junglers) you might like Nocturne, Udyr, Warwick, Aatrox. Give them a go.\nEvery champ is viable, its just who you have fun using. Just make sure you have 2-3 fun champs in each role so you don't pick yourself into a very hard matchup.\n\nIf you like Cait try Varus, Ashe or Tristana.\nIf you like Zed try Talon, Le Blanc and Ahri.","replies":[{"poster":"ZeusXXXXXX","date":"2014-12-25T23:14:01.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the help, really appreciate it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blood Harvest","date":"2014-12-25T12:03:37.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can play anyone you want, Don't let anyone tell you who you can and can't play, \nPlay champions that you think are fun not that you think are strong,\nBe you for you, Not for meta.\nMeta means jacksh!t, Play who you like\nDont worry about those people saying master yi is a noob champ,\nIf he is and hes broken why doesn't everyone else abuse it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Plottel","date":"2014-12-25T10:20:55.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry about your rank at all, it is not an accurate measure of skill.
