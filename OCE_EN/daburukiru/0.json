I always get bursted down and CCd in every single game no matter how I position, I always have to deal with supports that want to play aggressively, regardless of how I position, I never end up getting any peel (I know I can&#039;t rely on others because it has gotten me nowhere in League except for people I know). I end up losing laning phase, and it gets worse mid game. I just want to farm but am never given an moment&#039;s peace because everyone jumps on me when I&#039;m trying to farm regardless of whether I&#039;m in the jungle or in lane, (and yes I know we usually dont have enough vision but I can only put 3 wards down when noone else is warding, not even the support who may not have a sightstone)...and in teamfights its the absolute worst. I try and stay back but still end up getting caught by CC, or locked down, or jumped on. My match history is absolutely terrible. 0/5, 1/7, 2/7, etc (these are all recent games). You may ask why I&#039;m a Vayne main, but the truth is I love Draven and Vayne. But I play absolutely terribly. And it&#039;s really depressing me and hurting my confidence with playin Vayne. Sometimes I feel so low I just want to give up on Vayne in general and not play her, despite the fact I love playing her. \r\n\r\nI really need help (not just a guide on how to build her and what to do in laning phase, and especially not a guide describing her kit for 25 mins, Scrapcomputer, I&#039;m looking at you -_- ), I need a guide that teach me how to play her PROPERLY, as in positioning correctly, getting better mechanics, helping understand her limits and her power spikes, what to do when behind as Vayne, and when can she come back into the game, how to carry as her, and especially teamfighting and 1v1ng as Vayne. \r\n\r\nSomeone please help me.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-05-17T23:59:54.807+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"vaynes one of the squishiest champs in the game. its surprising to see you and sooo many other people play her so frequently when shes so squishy and reliant on her late game. 1st thing id recommend is to stop playing vayne because god only knows how many vaynes ive seen try to 1v1 me when im any other adc, meaning, i will always win, but if thats how you wanna play, play as garen\n\notherwise some advice for vayne. shes extremely squishy, which means your health is much more valuable than anyone elses health, meaning, dont lose your health if you cant win a trade. pretty much the only trading you can do is tumbling and E'ing your opponent into a wall and getting some aa's before running away before they can take anything out of you. you can also try aa'ing when you cant last hit anything and your siege minion is about to die, they're either going to lose 40 gold by trading back with you or they ignore you to get it meaning you ultimately come out on top\n\nof course the champ your support is playing is a big factor, as well as how good and how quick they are with their reactions. if you've got a passive annie support and they have a nami, you're probably just gonna lose the lane and its best to conserve every bit of health you can in sacrifice of a few minions. before even acknowledging your enemy bot lane its good to gauge what your support is like in the 1st few minutes. if you've got a soraka healing you at 80% health when shes at like 40%, chances are shes there for you and understands both of your roles and places you above her. if you've got a morgana whos last hitting your minions with her Q, then surrender at 20 lol, and focus on not dying over getting kills/assists\n\nyour build is one of the biggest factors in terms of life and death trades. your last ranked adc game was ezreal (assuming its adc) on the 30th of april, so ill assume this is the same build for your vayne. your runes are fine, but your masteries are 23-4-3. you sacrificed juggernaut for 1.5% move speed and 2.5% attack speed.....bad move, pretty much all adcs should have 21/9 or maybe even 21/0/9. juggernaut is an extremely important mastery and it can be the difference between life and death for a vayne or even a kat or a fizz etc. everyone knows you must run juggernaut in at least 90% of champs, its too strong\n\ndamn this is long. but only 8-10 minutes of writing, notbad.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-05-17T22:09:24.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teamfight positioning and mechanics are stuff you're going to just have to improve through practice. You'd probably learn a lot from watch some pro players streams or videos on youtube as well if you don't already.\n\nAlso, probably not what you want to hear, but you'd almost certainly benefit from playing an easier champ while you work on improving your positioning and laning and stuff. The more you have to focus on your mechanics (with vayne and draven etc.), the less effort you can put into other stuff. Go back to them later when you have better positioning and your results will be much better.","replies":[{"poster":"Daburukiru","date":"2015-05-17T23:27:23.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have no problems with other ADCs, like Ezreal, Corki, Ashe, Varus, Lucian, Graves but Vayne is someone who gives me a hard time. Even Draven feels easier than she does :/ I don't know why. But I think I'll do that. Watch some youtube streams on Vayne. I really wish they'd buff her, because I feel like shes been a bad pick ever since Season 4 rolled in","replies":[{"poster":"BUY MY MIXTAPE","date":"2015-05-19T02:30:53.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't even bother picking up vayne lol","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-05-18T01:35:14.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does anyone know if stacking Doran's Blade is still a viable strategy for early game?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lauricella3","date":"2015-05-17T23:45:36.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"position yourself near a wall if you feel you are going to be jumped on, for en easy tumble condemn.
