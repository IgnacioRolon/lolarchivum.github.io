Always Lose To Her as a Jungler","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm sick and tired of jungle {{champion:254}} . She's just so freaking OP and UNKILLABLE and she's SO EASY TO PLAY IT'S SICKENING. ESPECIALLY mid-late game. It doesn't matter what champs I pick (because in normal blind pick games and Solo Queue, whoever picks the right champions anyway), it doesn't matter how many times I gank or counter-gank, and every time I try and counter jungle her, I ALWAYS lose in duels to her! (on top of that, I can never catch Vi offguard because good Vi players are always so elusive). And then either she snowballs in lane or she snowballs her entire team, THEN becomes unkillable and a freaking powerhouse. And whenever I have a Vi jungle on my team, for some reason, they're so bad and end up feeding. But when they're on the enemy team, they're just ungodly and I'm tired of it! There are literally NO GUIDES AT ALL on how to counter Vi jungle whatsoever. Someone help me.\n\nHOW THE HELL DO YOU STOP VI JUNGLE FROM SNOWBALLING AND BECOMING UNKILLABLE (especially when you don't KNOW when the enemy will pick Vi and you don't have a team comp to stop champs like her) {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} . On a side note, yes I know Vi is part assassin, part tank, part fighter, and I hate assassins with a passion","replies":[{"poster":"Privasea","date":"2015-01-23T01:31:15.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's broken as hell. Literally if she is CC'ed in her ult she should receive a damage reduction on her Ult or just simply cancels and puts it on a shorter CD, shes broken beyond relief. Same situation as Rek'Sai... Build one damage item and full tank and still destroy anything she wants.","replies":[]},{"poster":"trumbe","date":"2015-01-22T15:41:07.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vi is a big late game.. if she isn't shutdown fast early-mid game then she is pretty unstoppable.. the best way i could see beating her and this is from someone who loves playing her as a jungle is to have cc and hard focus her after their adc.. If you see Vi picked.. getting a support or midlaner with some CC will greatly improve your chances of winning.. 1v1 she will beat most junglers.. maybe Lee/WW will normally beat her.. just depends on their health/position","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sethane","date":"2015-01-23T00:21:37.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree with Trumbe on the cc beats vi. Something like a full on 'screw you vi' like {{champion:89}} {{champion:22}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:25}} champs that have stupid cc and can catch her once she ults. But she isn't weak early/mid. Vi is a rare champ that is strong all game. Her weakest point is 1-5 after that she is stupid strong. If you want to beat her counter jg unbelievable hard. The new jg is amazingly good at dragging the jger down if they get behind. If you start to fall behind it is hard too catch up till about 30 mins in. At which point she is op anyway. Another tip vi is an amazing duelist and assassin. But she falls off in team fights kind of. If you can get a team fight comp or a champ that will stop her ulting you team effectively {{champion:9}}  fear I have found is annoying if your jg {{champion:40}} ult is very annoying if you are support {{champion:54}} if your top or jg. His ult once she ults our team should be enough to focus her fast. These are just some tips. They don't ways work and I completely agree she is op at the moment. Hopefully a nerf is incoming for vi, till then these tips should help you have some sought of fun before she hits late game and destroys everything in her way. :)","replies":[]}]}
