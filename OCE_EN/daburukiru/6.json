I've taken sound clips from 300, Metal Gear Solid, Portal, Dragon Ball Z and Unreal Tournament and made them into a somewhat complete soundpack.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwJoN5ZZki0","image":"/api/embedly/1/image/resize?url=http://i.ytimg.com/vi/qwJoN5ZZki0/hqdefault.jpg&key=a45e967db0914c7fb472fd4381e6c85b&width=425"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ladies and Gentleman, I proudly present to you...my soundpack ^_^\r\nIt replaces the dull boring voice announcer and there are some extras, such as custom songs for champ select, sound files if you want to use them in your own soundpack and hear them, as well as a custom countdown timer. I'd love for you all to give the video a watch, like and share if you like it, and please do download the soundpack and give it and the custom songs/custom countdown in the extras a shot. There are also clear concise noob-friendly instructions on how to install the soundpack (copy-paste-rename) but give me a message if you have questions or trouble with it. I would like to share this with the rest of the LoL community. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoycMTnZeMY\r\n\r\nEnjoy","replies":[{"poster":"DaemonicChivalry","date":"2015-02-12T23:44:00.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What happens when your game updates? do u have to re-do this again?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rok","date":"2015-01-15T04:26:17.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teammate Disconnected  (Variation 4) @3:23","replies":[{"poster":"Daburukiru","date":"2015-01-15T13:05:15.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha you like it?
