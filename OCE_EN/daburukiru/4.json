Cannot Accept ANY games Because of Client Freezing Before Champion Select","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok this has been happeneing for the last 2 months before patch 5.3 and it was only with ARAM, where the client would freeze before champion select so I could not change any runes or masteries, then either the game would load into loading screen or it would kick me out of champion select and give me the leaverbuster timer.\n\nEver since patch 5.6 on the day before patch 5.7 I cannot accept ANY games now. I can&#039;t accept normals, ranked, Bots, ARAM or customs. I reinstalled LoL, reinstalled Adobe AIR, and every time I hit \"accept match\" the client freezes and crashes and only returns the Lobby before 2-1 seconds of Champion Select timer (I don't even get a bugsplat) is left. It&#039;s really pissing me off. Rito what are you doing man. This has never happened before and it&#039;s frustrating both me and my friends since I keep dropping out and keeps giving me this error message:\n\n> \"An Unknown error has occurred. Sorry about that. We&#039;ve sent a report to the Server. If you continue encountering this Error you may want to check the support site or the forums for more information.\"\n\nIf I do this in customs it gives that error, and temporarily fixes the problem until I log off and log back in again.\n\nsomeone HELP! Preferably ASAP. I&#039;m tired of this{{champion:77}} {{summoner:14}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-10T08:50:58.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you scanned your computer for malicious softwares or viruses?","replies":[{"poster":"Daburukiru","date":"2015-04-10T14:28:21.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't think it's a virus or malicious software man.

The only times I've seen where it's the program's fault are ones concerning connection and security issues.\n\nHave you tried cleaning your computer's registry with something like CCleaner?","replies":[{"poster":"Daburukiru","date":"2015-04-11T12:46:40.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have not.

A stupid temporary fix but its better than the boards since incompetent Rito employees can't give me a decent answer.

Speaking of which, [have you read up on it](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)? They might have missed one or two points which you can try.\n\nOh yeah, and of course, make sure that all of you systems and softwares are up to date, like graphics drivers and operating systems and such.","replies":[{"poster":"Daburukiru","date":"2015-04-15T19:52:36.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has nothing to do with my internet as my internet is perfectly fine. I don't get lag or anything and not only that, it has something to do with the client even though I reinstalled and repaired it through the patch which is pretty stupid. Unfortunately I don't think I'll be able to do anything about this stupid problem and will probably have to do that temporary fix each time i log in","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-17T07:48:41.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't say it was your connection, but I won't deny that it *could* be. What it could be is that due to the way your computer is configured to connect to the internet, it is causing League to not be able to on some occasions (like, the first time it connects from boot).\n\nBy chance do you use a VPN? If you do, simply not using it might fix your issue. If not, do the following:\n\nI'd like to do a little trial. First, make sure you have the latest version of Java (they recently released an update so you may not have it yet) and turn off any firewalls and anti-viruses you may have activated. Then head over to http://netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/ and allow Java to run. Now, run League so that it goes into the problem where it says, \"Unknown error\". After exiting the game, run the test. The test takes around ten minutes and is susceptible to being affected by you using the internet connection, so don't do any network activities while it's running.\n\nAfter the initial test is done, save the log produced and then turn off your computer. Right after it reboots, open your browser and do the test again. Then, compare the two tests to see if there's any difference. If there is, mention them here and I'll try to see if it can be fixed. **Do not post the entire logs here.** If you absolutely must, then attach the logs as attachments to your reply.\n\nIf you need any clarity with those instructions, then just ask.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
