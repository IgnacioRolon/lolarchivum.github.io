When we look at other global ults, such as {{champion:81}} , {{champion:222}} , even {{champion:119}} . all of them have some form of cast time, be it half a second or one second, or they give SOME kind of indicatior that the ult is being fired. However, the right things were not changed to Ashe&#039;s ult and I feel slightly disappointed, and I&#039;m starting to wonder why Rito has not ever thought of giving Ashe&#039;s ult a cast time. \r\n\r\nThink about it: it&#039;s pretty much one of the best initiators in the game, and now with Ashe&#039;s rework, she can fire her ult at point blank range with almost a certain change of the target not being able to dodge due to no cast time, then immediately burst down the target with her 5th Q rapid fire, and her passive still dealing {{champion:157}} like similar crit damage but not as strong. Furthermore, it doesn&#039;t give players any indication or reaction time and you&#039;d have to have really fast reaction time to flash her ult from point blank range, even though you can easily sidestep if its not at point blank range. The stun is another reason why I think Ashe&#039;s ult should have a cast time\r\n\r\nI know this topic has been discussed time and time again, but it&#039;s merely just a suggestion, not a complaint. I have played many Ashe games myself and find it unfair for the enemy team, as well as been on the receiving end of the point blank ult. If it was given one second cast time, or even half a second cast time I think it would be fair; just like how all the other global ults.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-06-02T05:52:46.442+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well let's take a look at this then shall we?\n\nAshe's ult scales from AP, a stat she doesn't build, the stun involved increases in strength based on the distance the projectile traveled.\n\nDraven's ult scales from AD like the only stat he builds.\n\nEzreal's ult scales from BOTH AP and AD.\n\nJinx's ult not only scales with AD but also has a execute feature where damage is heavily ramped up the more health the target is missing.\n\nNow with all this in mind we find that in terms of power Ashe's ult is the weakest, yet possibly strongest in terms of utility. As her ult is more for utility than damage it can go ahead without having a cast time that the damage dealing ults require.","replies":[{"poster":"Yuuki Terumi","date":"2015-06-10T04:25:49.919+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The point being made is counterplay. In terms of counterplay, her opponents have very little time to react to her ult going out at point blank range. The same argument was made for Veigar's stun, where it came out essentially instantly too, and there was pretty much little the opponent could do to avoid it. Everyone hated it, but it gave Veigar's ability some counterplay.\n\nAdding the cast time will also add some skill to Ashe. If you project your ult too hard, they'll get out of the way, not to mention this makes the ult an engagement tool, not a dueling tool anymore. Seriously you get into a heated engage with Ashe and bam. Ult in your face. Your HP is gone before you can act. That's hardly fair. She does plenty of damage now too, she can out-damage even the likes of Jinx.\n\nThough in this case, Ashe's ult is a skillshot, so it can still be evaded if you make a strictly timed Flash. However, the animation for auto-attack and her throwing out her ult are almost identical, meaning reacting to her ult is incredibly difficult, and you feel cheated. Again though, it also adds skill. There is also the use of fog of war and bush vision too, she can hide the animation with that, and it'll essentially be almost unchanged that way.\n\nBut let me also add onto your statements. In the 1-2 seconds you are stunned by her ult, she can deal far more damage than Draven, Ezreal's and Jinx's ult combined thanks to her new Q. She has plenty of tools outside of her ult already.\n\nNot to mention the addition of a cast time would not weaken her ability to engage team fights from long range at all. That part is still very strong.\n\nLow-down is, adding the cast time will make direct fights with her more fair. Her engagement, and surprise value, those are unchanged.\n\nLook at it this way, her insta-casting ult was all she had going for her before the rework because she was complete balls at trading with someone, but with her rework, she's doing incredible DPS to her targets, so now this insta-cast ult is an overload on her kit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UltraFireFX","date":"2015-07-24T12:21:16.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Well let's take a look at this then shall we?\n\nkek senpai\n\n>Ashe's ult scales from AP, a stat she doesn't build,\n\nAP Ashe dis-approves\n\n> the stun involved increases in strength based on the distance the projectile traveled.\n\nBecause it's hard to hit???\n\n> Draven's ult scales from AD like the only stat he builds.\n\nOnly bonus AD, you can't get much of that really (about 160 from items), not without expending attack speed and critical strike chance.\n\n> Ezreal's ult scales from BOTH AP and AD.\n\nYes but unless you are an idiot and get shit like Rage-blade, it won't scale significantly of both of those at once.\nFuture more, AP Ashe's R actually does more damage than an AP Ezreal's to one-target but also has CC which allows for following up\n\n> Jinx's ult not only scales with AD \n\nJinx's ult MUST be cast on low-health targets to actually wound them, it just so happens that those wounds become fatal because they are low, that's very situational compared to Ashe's ult\n\n> but also has a execute feature where damage is heavily ramped up the more health the target is missing.\n\nBecause it's a execute, it does more damage, and since they are missing health, it's more likely to kill them, you neglected to mention this also has a range ramp and does more damage during the first second of flight","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"vicelore","date":"2015-06-02T04:48:38.679+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"ive used it point blank lots it hardly ever saves your life.","replies":[{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-06-03T21:50:13.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also most champions nowadays have at least 1 gapclose skill which is one of Ashe's biggest counter","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2015-06-14T07:52:55.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"retarded idea... the arrow is fairly slow and easy to dodge. if this happens ashe can join evelynn.","replies":[{"poster":"Daburukiru","date":"2015-06-18T14:54:07.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You try dodging it when it's right in your face -.- you need really high reflexes and at least a flash to dodge that shit","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2015-06-20T06:22:35.747+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah not that easy but... how many champs have non ult point and click aoe stuns that dont require channeling.","replies":[{"poster":"UltraFireFX","date":"2015-07-24T12:11:10.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> yeah not that easy but... how many champs have non ult point and click AoE stuns that don't require channeling.\n\nGosh, how to cover your arse, make all the clauses!\n\nHere's a list:\nAmumu (R), Anivia (Q), Annie (W), Brand (Q), Gragas (E, R), Leona (W), Lissandra, Nautilus (), Pantheon, Poppy, Riven (Q3, W), Sejuani (Q, R), Sona (R), Syndra (W), Taric (E), Twisted Fate (W (Gold Card)), Udyr (E), Vayne (E), Xerath (Q)\nNeed any more stuns?\n\nBy the way, if you are good you will still hit your damned stunned but she won't get away on 3 hp because she ult-ed you.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-01T21:28:35.731+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">If it was given one second cast time, or even half a second cast time I think it would be fair\n\nNo, if it was given this people wouldn't use point blank Ashe ult's and people will be bitching that she is always using them cross map.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-06-02T04:00:30.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Ashe's Ult is intended for cross map.
