Every single game....every single game I&#039;m in, either my ass gets handed to me by a Zed or a Talon, or my midlaner feeds a Zed/Talon and they just single handedly win the entire game. There are literally no guides on countering these two champions and by the time you get a QSS or Zhonyas, you or someone else have already fed them 4 kills with them having about 100 CS.\n\nHOW do you counter Zed and Talon? HOW?! Someone help me here! How do you counter them both in lane and stop them from snowballing as well as dealing with fed Zed and Talons? What are their weaknesses? How do you deal with their bullshit? -.-\n\nUPDATE: FORGET IT, THIS IS WHY THERE ARE NO BLOODY GUIDES BECAUSE ALL OF YOUR ANSWERS ARE GODDAMN OBVIOUS ONES AND GOD AWFUL..","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-29T19:49:08.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"CC","replies":[{"poster":"Daburukiru","date":"2015-06-29T21:17:51.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"WOW...Thank you for the damn blatantly obvious!

What you could do when Talon uses his ultimate ability and then appears behind you using his E ability is to move, Flash, blink or dash behind him so that the blades of his ultimate don't go through you when they return to him.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-06-30T03:09:29.592+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Buy armor since they only deal physical damage and buy QSS or Zhonya to counter Zed ult.

Don't worry too much about a level 1 rake harrass (it's basically one auto for 60 mana). \nEverytime he goes to cs punish him for it. Don't let him get 15 gold without receiving damage in return \nSo talons big power spikes are lvl 3,6, when he gets brutalizer/tiamat, lvl 11\nBe wary of these levels and play a little safer \nTalons will usually only jump on you if they have E up... E has a huge cd like 15 seconds in laning phase... During that time be aggressive (know where the enemy jg is at)  \nLike everyone said earlier by lvl 6 you should have some armor (a seekers arm guard could make he'll for talon)  if you're an ad mid then get cloth armor \nLevel 6 is the danger zone for talon and this is usually when most talons begin to roam \nMia ping everytime you don't see him in lane even if you saw him back\nThe second he's out of lane hard push your wave so he loses experience. From this point you have some options you could continue to push multiple waves so he loses out on more experience or roam to another lane or take raptors (team or enemy) or go to ward enemy jungle your jungle, etc\n\nIn team fights babysit your adc because more than likely talon is gonna jump either you or the adc... Have oracles lense or a pink the second the team fight begins so that you can see him go invis and proceed to burst him down if he jumps in and always have zhonyas ready to be activated \n\nZed \nLaning is a lot harder against zed because he uses energy so he can constantly poke you \nTry to get to lvl 2 before zed and assert aggression. If you hit lvl 2 first then harass constantly until he hits level 2...if he's scared of you then constantly stay in front of your melee minions (know where the enemy jg is) and zone him out... If he's smart and starts trading with you then back up. The thing with zed is that his shadow has a long cd as well. So if he carelessly uses his shadow then go harass him\nZed has very similar power spikes to talon \nWhen zed hits six make sure you're not below half health under tower cause it's easy to tower dive as zed... Rush zhonyas... A lot like talon, if zed is gone from lane Mia and push wave/take raptors/ward/etc \n\nTeam fights \nUnlike talon zed doesn't have much team fighting ability so just wait it out. Just like talon zed will go for you or the adc so be ready to peel for yourself or your adc... Unless you're absolutely sure you can kill zed don't chase \n\nNo one can really tell you specific tips unless you give us specific match ups... Talon and zed aren't very hard match ups(unless you choose a champ that gets hard countered by them) I'm sure if there's a specific champion match up people can give you better advice","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-06-29T23:58:34.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not feeding him four kills before you get your QSS or Zhonyas helps. Greatly. \nIf you can't do that then you're clearly versing a Zed that's way better than you. Or/and you or your teammates need to learn not to feed 4 kills that early. \nIf you're support you can save your Exhaust for his ultimate. Use Exhaust after he has ulted his target.","replies":[{"poster":"Daburukiru","date":"2015-06-30T21:42:48.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And just HOW are you supposed to deal with a Zed/Talon that's better than you? THAT IS WHAT I AM ASKING! And how am I supposed to stop my feeding mid lanes?! They always bloody push to tower and die!

Don't believe that you can't beat him because if Zed was unbeatable all Zeds would be winning their lane and that's not the case. He's not impossible to beat just play smart and just don't die to him. Don't take risks that you think you can kill him because if that Zed is way better than you then you'll probably die. Understand what his abilities can do and think about what items would be effective against him. There are hundreds of tips in the internet, search it on Google. \n\nThe one way would be to pick heavy counter-picks but I'm not sure there are any besides {{champion:1}}. She has stuns that last for a long time and high damage to go with it. She can be pretty tanky with some health {{item:3027}} because of her Molten Shield thing. She's not difficult either. \n\n{{champion:8}} mid can work as well, build a little durability with early armor, {{item:3157}} {{item:3116}} and some {{item:3152}} and you can sustain through Zed's harassments in lane phase. The point of picking Vladimir here is that you can Sanguine Pool your way out of Zed's ultimate. I'm not sure if it puts his Death Mark on cooldown though. Vladimir has generally has high health with his passive so you are tankier than most full AP mid laners. \n\nAny other range midlaner can work as long as you don't end up feeding Zed. It's really not impossible, just be really really careful and stay under tower if the Zed is really aggressive and really skilled. Don't expect to get 100 kills in a match against a Zed that's way out of your League if it's the case. Just don't be part of the (feeding) problem and you can proud about that if it happens. \n\nI find this website incredibly useful and quick.\nhttp://www.championselect.net/champions/zed","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-30T22:32:37.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So i'm upvoting all the comments in here that are \"obvious advice\" because clearly the OP is a douchebag and doesn't actually want help but to bitch instead.","replies":[]}]}
