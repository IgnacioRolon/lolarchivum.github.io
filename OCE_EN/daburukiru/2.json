For example, I decided I wanted to practice Yasuo top (because I'm the worst Yasuo in OCE), and of all things in a blind pick, Teemo goes top (and god knows nobody can deal with a Teemo in low ELO). I ended up feeding because he would always blind me when he got low HP and it sort of put me on tilt because I wanted to kill him so badly. And he basically put me so behind the entire game, and I ended up going 5/15/4 or something like that. How do you play against a {{champion:17}}  and win as {{champion:157}} ? I always prematurely Wind Wall when I think he's going to throw his blind because he continously spammed that at me. And even with help from the jungle Lee Sin, we still couldn't manage to kill him because he would always have a slither of HP left  (like 50HP every time). How do you deal with this hard match-up?\r\n\r\nAlso, how do you deal with people who are much more skilled than you are in lane? I mean, sure obviously you can just farm under tower and ask for ganks, but sometimes the jungler isn't very skilled or very aware either so you're usually on your own. And if you get ganked that makes things even more worse :/ you could just farm under tower, but you'll be zoned out and denied CS while the person way better than you are can either free farm or if they're strong enough, dive you under tower and kill you. And you are forced to eventually give up your lane either early or mid. I get it that you can lane swap but 90% of the games I play, people won't lane swap because \"they got their role\" (and these are normal games), so I end up doing worse without much help. \r\n\r\nWhat I'm asking simply, aside from help with beating {{champion:17}}  as {{champion:157}} , is how to deal with hard counters and people who are more skilled than you are?\r\n\r\nOn another note, how the heck do you get your team to actually listen to you and either upgrade the trinket to {{item:3362}}  and/or buy {{item:3364}} ? In 99% of the games I've played against a {{champion:17}}   I am always the only one either with a {{item:3362}} or an {{item:3364}}, or even a simple {{item:2043}} !","replies":[{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-02-20T15:38:58.149+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it's a matchup you don't win then don't bother trying!?!?!

If you get zoned, let him push and get your jungler to gank for you.\n**IMPORTANT : If you're in gold or below and your jungle doesn't really know what he's doing, then ask mid lane (politely) for a roam.**\n\n\n*TL;DR of TL;DR : Don't be that %%%%head who knows he's been doing badly lately/has been boosted but still queues up for ranked.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shyvana Bot","date":"2015-02-21T04:37:32.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah as a bronze player i learned this lesson the hard way, basically if he hard counters you it doesn't mean your tea will have problems with him. You have 2 options, first you can ask for a lane switch, this might or might not work depending on who you switch with and how bronze V they are. Secondly you can just play passive, only take the cs that you can get safely. don't walk past 20 minions and 2 champions to get that one cs and lose 3/4 of your hp. so now not only are you tower hugging but also disable. ending the landing phase 30 cs below your counter is with a score of 0/0/0 for both sides is far better for your team that getting that 30 cs and finishing 0/5/0. Your counter leaving the landing phase unfed means that your team can fight him on even ground and he wont just plow you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CIoudz","date":"2015-02-20T14:56:14.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're asking things that just can't be given a definite answer, pretty much all this stuff is situational and just requires experience.  When playing against players than are better than you, just wait for them to make a mistake and try to capitalise on them when you can, but again you can't just tell someone do this or do that, you just have to play reactively. As for getting your team to buy wards or swap out trinkets there isn't anything that you can do to fix that. If they listen they listen if they don't they dont","replies":[]}]}
