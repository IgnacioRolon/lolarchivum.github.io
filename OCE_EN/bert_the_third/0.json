Champion ideas Two for the price of one","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi my names Bert the Third and I enjoy sailing the sea and sinking those annoying Land lover! But it has come to our attention that Bilgewater is running on a skeleton crew, So after much debate or \"Parrrley\" I release my horde of ideas into the web. These are ideas only, I have not the tavern yard to accompany them or the numbers of woe\n\n\nBehind every Great Captain there is the Quartermaster, \n\n___ The Quarter master\nPassive, Crow's nest,  the Champion is able to convert team wards on the map into a crow nest, The Crow nest has only reveals 3/4 that of a ward , but reveal champions when they activate abilities, or auto attacks within the Crow nest extended range.  Maximum of one. \nQ -  Blunderbuss, The quartermaster draws a Blunderbuss and fires in the selected direction, damaging and knocking back all enemies in its path\nW -  A vast!, The champion throws out their rope, and ensnares the 1st target they hit. if the target happens to be the crow nest they are then able to swing from their current position to land in a area around the mast.\nE - Supply cache, The champion creates a supply cache in a targeted location, these caches provide health and mana regen to allies that reveal it. The cache can only be used once, unless refilled by the champion (ie walks up and recasts that ability (reduced price)). The cache turns invisible after a few seconds from use. \nR - Saboteur,\nUpon 1st cast, the champion is able to detonate any supply caches with in ranges, if he is near a crow nest the range is increased.\nUpon 2nd cast, all Caches with in his range detonate\nWhen Caches explode, they are reveal for half a second before dealing damage, if the cache still had supplies the damage is increased and enemies are affected with a 2 second ignite (rum hurts)\n\n\nBilgewater is dangerous place not everyone makes it to the island, and for every ship that has sunk it grows larger\n\n____ The Dammed \nPassive - The champions basic attacks applies spores to his targets, if the target happens to be a ward of targetable trap, vision is shared (this can be cleared out with activation of a sweeping lense)\nQ - Impale, On the champions next attack they impale their target dealing damage and risings the target into the air. the target is now considered airborne.\nW - Part of the Rift, For the next 2/4/6/8/10 Seconds the champion enters a trace like state, able to walk through any terrain, creep or minion, he also becomes immune to all forms of CC and infects nearby enemies with spores, the effect wears off on his next cased ability or auto attack\nE - Infect,\n\tPassive - whenever the champion is struck with basic attacks, or on hit abilities spores are released from his body, the greater the damage the larger amount of spores \treleased\n\tActive - the spores on enemy champion become active and greatly reduces the infected Armour and movement speed\nR - Part of the Crew, with a brief delay all minions around the champion are converted to his side, they gain bonus movement speed, resistances and health. They die when the slain, or the champion is killed.\nOr\nR -  Part of the Crew, with a brief delay all slain minions around the champion come back to life, gaining Attack speed, movement speed, but have reduced Armour and health. They last for 30 seconds before decaying. once summons they cannot be summoned again. \n\n\nSo avast my lads and lasses what be's the crews opinion?","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2015-01-20T01:40:45.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Lubber it is land lubber and you think you're good with pirates","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2015-01-20T01:41:38.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DarkShade918,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=PVOspngF,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-20T01:40:45.501+0000)\n>\n> *Lubber it is land lubber and you think you're good with pirates\n\nBut the champs seem good, i quickly read through no major problems, but  i like OP people so im not likely to notice anyhting","replies":[{"poster":"Bert the Third","date":"2015-01-20T01:57:06.925+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aye that be true, Well thanks anyway of the feedback","replies":[{"poster":"MayorRobFord","date":"2015-01-20T02:40:08.988+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also it's BLUNDERBUSS not bundlerbuss\nAlso I appreciate you making  designing more pirates\nAll hail the pirate king","replies":[{"poster":"Bert the Third","date":"2015-01-20T03:14:14.815+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, I have a bad case of Spelrvy, \nI need more oranges, but where did he hide them?","replies":[{"poster":"MayorRobFord","date":"2015-01-20T08:17:51.006+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to criticise your spelling again I appreciate you designing pirates but in the blunderbuss description you spelt it blunerbuss\n\n\n\nThanks again and I think Gangplanks oranges are kept in packets that look like ketc{{champion:41}} hup","replies":[{"poster":"Bert the Third","date":"2015-01-20T11:33:02.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would explain so much!
