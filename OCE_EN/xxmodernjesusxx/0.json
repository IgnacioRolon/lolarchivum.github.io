I believe I shouldn&#039;t have gotten 5x20 min penalty for this, since we won anyway so leaving the match for 10 minutes didn&#039;t negatively influence anyone else.\r\n\r\nToo OP nerf Pls??\r\n\r\nAnd I would really appreciate it if you(talking to Rito) could remove this penalty from me right now since I believe I didnt deserve that and I don&#039;t want to waste 100 min just waiting.","replies":[]}
