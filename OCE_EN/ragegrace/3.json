No two teams from the same group can be placed on the same half of the bracket \r\n2. Each Quarterfinal will feature one No. 1 seed and one No. 2 seed from Groups.\r\n\r\nSo, OG got drawn into FNC group, but got bumped into the group with FW. This is weird, because they were not part of the same group. Furthermore, you can&#039;t say that the region needs to be different because clearly from the KT Rolster v Koo tigers, both korean teams. \r\n\r\nSo can anyone explain this to me? I got real confused.","replies":[{"poster":"RageGrace","date":"2015-10-13T09:29:41.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, makes so much more sense now.
