It&#039;s happened twice already, and other times it&#039;s extremely slow loading where everyone would connect and join a minute or so later. I use an iMac (pls senpai don&#039;t hate) and this never usually happens.\r\n\r\nAlthough i&#039;m not fussed, it has resulted in me getting a lower priority queue. \r\n\r\nHas anyone had similar experiences and/or know of any solutions to get around this?
