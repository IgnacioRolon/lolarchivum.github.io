In silver/gold players make throws left, right and centre.\n- You are an ADC main with **high mechanical experience.**\n\nTeamspeak 3 is optional, but preferred.\n\nMy winrates as of now are below;\nThresh 58% (22/16)\nMorgana 56% (14/11)\nLeona 73% (8/3)\n[I can play virtually _every_ support, so if you have a preference make sure you let me know.]\n\nIf you can&#039;t find my name, it&#039;s a sign we shouldn&#039;t be playing together. I would really prefer people 17+, I really don&#039;t care what gender you are, so if you are a female i&#039;ll conduct myself the same as I would my male friends, so you don&#039;t have to worry about being treated differently.\n\nEnjoy the rest of your day, send me a message and i&#039;ll let you know if i&#039;m free to play.\n\n**-Sud**","replies":[{"poster":"NeverEndingBong","date":"2016-07-02T05:12:50.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2016-07-02T06:05:58.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This man's CS is absolutely terrible.

I believe there are some ADC mains who find it difficult to climb, not because of their mechanical capabilities, but because of their total lack of common sense. [i.e. running into the midst of a baron fight, attempting a 1v3 as an unfed vayne and/or face checking brushes late game].\n\nIn my belief, some crucial things can be taught, which can increase a player's capabilities exponentially.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2016-07-02T04:21:07.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add me.
