I hope you guys can learn something from this. It&#039;ll mostly boil down to champions, builds and instinct. \r\n\r\nIf you&#039;re currently a support main in low silver or bronze, send me a friend request in game.\r\n\r\nSkype is a necessity (or any other voice chat). \r\n\r\nHopefully some of you are interested in this!\r\n-Sud (IGN: AlphaCueSlowly)","replies":[{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-11-04T22:31:04.859+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol","replies":[{"poster":"AlphaCueSlowly","date":"2016-11-05T01:16:19.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Knuuckles,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=v0OKgErA,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-11-04T22:31:04.859+0000)\n>\n> Lol\n\nGee thanks, I guess me attempting to help out the minority, least-preferred role in LoL for free warrants a condescending \"Lol\".
