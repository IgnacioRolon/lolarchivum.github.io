Now I neglected ranked on OCE as I live overseas for this year and I play on 100 ping but I decided to try grind for plat which wasn't hard considering I was a diamond level garena player against low/mid plats. The issue now comes to the timezone dateline. Players playing from abroad or just from other regions of OCE with different timezones can easily get confused as to when the season comes to an end. By just giving us a specific date and asking players to decipher when exactly that is to be is really a concern for players who play from further away from the servers and want to do an end of season climb. It is thus my recommendation that you give actual timezone datelines as to when the season is to end. Vagueness is not a thing that should happen on either the player's or developer's side and giving us a date and not a timezone, especially for regions with a wide array of timezone differences, could effectively cripple players who try to do these end of season streaks. So that is my experience with end of season climb and the vague single date of 19th November I was given. For the sake of people like me who play from different regions or has temporarily moved there or even those in the local region but live in a different timezone from the server, please give a timezone TIME, instead of just a date.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-11-19T01:39:55.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a bit confused as to what you mean by \"adding a timezone time\" in this context. As far as I'm aware, both the patch notes and in the client gave specific dates/times with the relevant timezone (which is always AEDT/AEST for OCE), and from that it's not particularly difficult to figure out what that means in *your* local timezone (you could calculate the difference, or just use a search engine such as Google to find a time zone converter). Dates and times are usually localised, and usually also have the appropriate timezone attached.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OCE VortexDragon","date":"2019-11-18T16:32:05.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Moreover, with something as important as this, which creates a lasting effect over the whole year it should be well outlined in every form possible don't you think?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ooftman","date":"2019-11-18T23:58:20.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"you can literally open the client, click profile -> Ranked and there is a countdown","replies":[]}]}
