I waited a little but I ended up alt+F4 in order to try to reconnect faster from the laucher.\r\nBack to the launcher, there was no such option, I was on the home menu just as if my game never existed, and I was even able to start a new game (what I did), but, fuck it, I was winning this ranked, and I don&#039;t know if my mates were kicked as well or if I will have 9 reports for leaving a game.\r\nGet me back me 20 LP and fix the game please :3","replies":[{"poster":"         Swhyper","date":"2017-08-14T08:00:45.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nTo stop future disconnections with League, please ensure that your DNS is using Riots preferred DNS.
