The punishment system in this game is fairly simple in my opinion and it surprises me that people think it's so stringent when it could be much tougher. \n\nI'm a super competitive person who can be easily frustrated by poor play and sometimes I'll question my team's decision making openly in our team chat when I'm tilted by how the game is going or what is happening. \n\nHowever, it's fairly easy to draw a line between making a comment directly related to an in-game play or sequence of events in-game and the inappropriate decision of calling your teammate racist or homophobic slurs or threatening them and wishing harm on them and the people around them which is what leads to almost every ban you read about on these boards.","replies":[{"poster":"Hi im Durian","date":"2018-02-09T04:25:04.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But that's not the case isn't it.\n\nHow often is there a ban for discrimination chats?\n\nAnd how often is there a ban for intentional feeding, un-supportive behaviour?\n\nWasn't there a troll who int every game, and he had been doing it for weeks without a ban?\n\nAnd there is tons of post about people being racist getting instant ban?\n\nPut it simple: The system does not encourage players to be racist.\nBut, the system is unable to effectively ban people who ruin the game for everyone else, which I shall remind you piss people off.\n\nIt's very honourable that you could remain calm when these people for doing so.\n\nBut not everyone can handle it.

If you want community feedback on a punishment, this is the easiest way to get it, since without the log we can only make vague assumptions based on what you've given us, which may or may not apply to you.\n\nPunishment typically has 4 tiers (10 game chat restriction, 25 game chat restriction, 14 day ban, permanent ban) with each punishment increasing, but behaviour like hate speech/suicide encouragement, or gameplay offences (because a chat ban for gameplay wouldn't make sense) are the most common things that can escalate you straight to a 14 day ban (skipping chat restrictions).\n\nIf you want feedback on your previous punishment you could post those logs as well, but unless you saved them somewhere you'd probably have to ask support for them.\n\nObviously we can only take your word for it on a lot of this stuff, but it's for you to know what got you punished anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-06T11:56:35.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> I've received one ban in the past, solely for using the word \"%%%\" in a game\n\nHe got an auto 14 day ban and then perma'd, not much to it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-06T11:57:56.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah I missed that, I'll edit my post a bit.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-02-12T21:03:02.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not true lol..
