In my opinion, it is very unbalanced. For instance, my main champs are support and it is nearly impossible to get &quot;S&quot; when you play support. I had games with scores like 4/2/23 which I believe is a good score for a support but would only get like an &quot;A&quot; grade. I also play tanky tops and tanky junglers like Amumu, Maokai... Lots of utility but not many kills. Again, same story, great score but &quot;A&quot; rating. Even with utility mages in mid it is hard to get &quot;S&quot; let alone &quot;S+&quot;. From what I&#039;ve seen so far, ADC and assassin type junglers and mid can easily get &quot;S&quot; which in my opinion isn&#039;t really fair. I think supports and tanks would also like to get some good rankings and some chests. I don&#039;t know what this system is based on, from what I understand, it takes KDA and CS into consideration which is something supports and even tanks don&#039;t get a lot of. Maybe if the system knew which role someone is playing, it could take into consideration that a support won&#039;t get kills and CS but is still of great value to the team.\r\nHope you get some time to look into this issue, if you consider it to be an issue. :)\r\nCheers! \r\n{{champion:25}}","replies":[{"poster":"Lapis","date":"2017-01-15T13:44:36.767+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Really? I find it easy to get S ranks with supports, but not anywhere else lol. What are your wards like? That's a big part of how supports are scored too.","replies":[{"poster":"Cipica","date":"2017-01-16T05:57:51.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, my wards are decent but not great. :) I get S with supports but it felt much harder than when playing adc or assassins. I'm obviously doing something wrong then! :) Time to step up the wards game then!
