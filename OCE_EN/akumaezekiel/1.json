Assuming it is a legitimate Law **(and i seriously doubt it)** there will be many factors that affect it, firstly is it even a New Zealand or Australian law? Maybe it is only American? perhaps its only relevant to one specific state in America? Does it apply to online discussions where the recipient has the option to leave the discussion? Or does it only apply to physical face to face situations? How do they enforce this law? It can't be proven in a court of law because unless one of the parties had a recorder playing in their pocket, there is no evidence, and it becomes a (my word against yours) situation, this is doubly true if the person actually commits suicide because then there is no witness. \n\nRemember if you cant enforce a law, theres no point making it.\nIf this was a legitimate law that must be enforced then I'm pretty sure you'd be Jailing the majority of the teenage population that get into fights with their parents. \n\nSecondly, if you are depressed enough to take your own life because someone you have never and will never meet told you to, then **YOU SHOULD NOT BE PLAYING ONLINE COMPUTER GAMES**, its that simple, most computer games (LoL especially) can be hyper stressful. So i think any doctor you talk to will back up my point that if you are suicidal you should not play computer games like lol. Knowing this, if they do decide to disobey the doctor and throw caution to the winds and participate in a stressful environment where harsh language is commonplace, then its hardly Summoner 4 (or whatever)'s problem its your own problem. \n\nWe all know that lions are dangerous, and the Zookeepers tell us not to climb into the lions cage for our own safety, so if we climb into the lions cage anyway, and get mauled. Is it the lions fault? or is it our fault?\nHow is it different for a suicidal person, they know that league has harsh language, they know that they are at risk of killing themselves, and know that they shouldn't be participating in this situation, and they jump in anyway, in doing so they are taking the responsibility into their own hands. Its not the Lion (Summoner 4)'s fault. Summoner 4 shouldn't be mean, and the Lion should be well fed already. But if you choose to take that chance and climb into the lions den, thats your choice and no one else can be blamed for that action. \n\nYes its not fair that if you are suicidal you should give up playing Lol, but to be frank when your life is at risk, you cant afford to be 'fair', you (and your family/friends) have to do what is best to ensure your survival, and if you choose to play Lol anyway despite putting your own life at risk and risking all the pain and suffering it will bring to your family and friends then you're the cruel one.\n\nThink of the species as a whole, 'survival of the fittest' if you're dumb enough to climb into the lion's cage at the Zoo, then perhaps its not a bad thing that your genetics are wiped from the population.\n\nThe long and short of it is: People should not be mean to other people, but they are, and always have been. Our prisons are full of murders and rapists, the ISIS militant group kills people on public television and launches a war of death and terror on the west, I think society's last problem is some 12 year old being mean on a fictional online computer game.","replies":[]}]}
