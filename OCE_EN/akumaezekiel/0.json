Mid lane, JG, and ADC!!!!","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Kasagi Jodo.\nThe Hunters Regret.\n\nThe champion in it&#039;s self was meant to be a jungler that shared similarities with Caitlyn, Kindred and even small aspects from Lulu, and with a bit of development he has become another Assassin, Fighter that relies on Crits.\n\nPassive: Lowered Guard.\nIf champion attacks a champion afflicted with &quot;Low Guard&quot; then the next basic attack will deal 80% Crit and abilities will deal 100% Crit\n(Creators Note: This seems a bit over powered however the concept for this  champion only has one heavy damaging ability)\n \nCrit also applies to champion if attacked by a target that was invisible less than 1 second ago (only applies to champion)\n\n(similar to Kha&#039;Zix&#039;s passive but only AD)\n\nQ: Sight\nChampion sets a trap that when activated by enemy contact are snared for 1 second (scales with level) and are left with &quot;Low Guard&quot; and a small bleeding damage (don&#039;t worry the damage overall won&#039;t be too much of a concern) Enemy champion that has been affected by this trap will also give sight to you and ally champions. \n\nW: Spy\nSpy turns your champion into a small creature that will go unnoticed in a bush (effect is only temporary) if nearby an enemy champion they gain  &quot;Low Guard&quot; until you have reverted back or are out of range. While in this form you can not be targeted however you can be effected by AOE damage, splash damage or poisons etc. (basically you can&#039;t be affected by skill shots or point and clicks)\n\nE: Hunters Escape\nYour champion leaps a short distance (long enough to jump over walls) If you are wielding your daggers, targets that cannot see you gain &quot;Low Guard&quot;\n\nIf you are wielding a bow you shoot an arrow that deal ap and ad in a straight line skill shot.\n-On enemy hit you are able to leap again. (stacks up to three times)\n-On ally hit you are able to leap straight to that ally.\n\nR: Hunters Ambush\nYour champion leaps at an enemy dealing ad leaving them with a bleeding effect twice as strong as the one with your Q so long as the bleeding effect is in place vision is granted to you and allied champions. Champions that have been attacked this way lose the ability to get &quot;Low Guard&quot; for a set amount of time.\n\nWith a Bow: Stampede\nYou fire a large flurry of arrows in one direction dealing ap and ad\n\nA possibility I wanted to add to this champion was the ability to swap between either a bow and dual wielding daggers with a similar kind of system that gangplanks ult works except instead of upgrading his ult he can swap out a bow for daggers turning him into a ranged champion instead of a melee turning him into a potential adc.\n\nI&#039;ve already started on concepts for this champion but I doubt my hopes of him becoming a real champion will happen although I still hope it will get noticed by Rito at least. XD\n\nwell in appearance he is just a normal guy with rabbit fur half way up each arm, rabbit ears and fond of light armor and a collar. I might post the picture somewhere and add a link idk.\n\nwelp thanks for reading this far..\n\nIf you want to keep reading here is some lore....\n\nIn the Kumungu Jungle it was not impossible for strange things to happen. A girl turning into a cougar was not a far fetched idea when in the jungle, even in some cases a boy growing parts that of a rabbit. Now you may think how can a rabbit survive in a jungle with cougars in it?\n\nThis tale begins with a young boy who at the age of 10 ran away from his home in Ionia Traveling through Noxus. In Noxus the boy met a Dangerously Beautiful women who held two daggers with pride that shone off of her crimson hair. To the age of 12 she raised the boy teaching him the basics of wielding a daggers and where to strike a human. After leaving Noxus the boy traveled towards the shurima desert where he meet a fair maiden of ice who carried with her an icey bow that did not melt in the sunlight he traveled with her to the age of 14 in which during that time he kept up his training with daggers but was also taught in the ways of the marksman. once they made it to Shurima they parted ways.\n\nThe dessert was a hard place for the boy to survive until he came across a maiden carrying something large and circular what it was is a mystery to the boy because she had it concealed their entire trip. Just like the last two he stayed with her until he turned 16 he studied all in shurima in the void creature he had meet one day.\n\nafter he left Shurima desert the boy was trained enough to fend for himself thus leaving him at the outskirts of the kumungu jungle. as he stepped foot into the jungle lesser beings followed him and leaped around him as to ward him off, However the boy ignored this warning. A year had past in the Kumungu jungle and the boy had fallen ill, all this time he had been protecting not only himself but the lesser beings of the kumungu jungle. As he was lying in his deathbed he heard the soft tone of a lovely maiden wake him from his short slumber but with a twist. His ears where gone yet his sense of hearing was three times better than what it was previously, while he wielded his bow he would keep his male figure however if he were to pick up the two daggers he would pass out awakening again as a female. After some time Kusagi realized that his ears were not gone but had changed to that of a rabbits. By 18 fur had grown from his wrists up to his elbows and his mobility had also increased to come close to that of the women he had met in Shurima. The boy had become one with the lesser beings of the Jungle.\n\nThe lore could also be changed to make him seem more like a tree and could develop into an elderwood skin.\n   ","replies":[{"poster":"Little Wolff","date":"2016-04-28T01:22:15.852+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry I could be retarded but how does the bow or dagger system work? I feel the ult could be how she changes from weapons?\n\nSorry how he*\n\nOn that note, why not he be a elvin warrior or somthing within runterra that has a voided split personality where the acher with the bow being a female and the daggerd assassin being male. It is a concept that is unique and there is no champ that is both genders would be something that could get looked at ","replies":[{"poster":"Horizonn","date":"2016-04-28T06:28:43.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Holy damn that's an insane idea!!
