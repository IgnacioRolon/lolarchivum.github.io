My RP is displayed correctly, and I can still view both my rune pages and loot tab, but trying to access the store just gets me a session expired notification, no matter where I try to access it from. I&#039;ve even tried viewing the store through my browser and through a 4G connection at the store page&#039;s URL [here](https://store.oc1.lol.riotgames.com/) but I just get the same result.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else run into the same issue? If you have and have since resolved the issue, what worked for you?","replies":[{"poster":"Z3rOzZ","date":"2017-05-15T02:19:01.139+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"im having the same issue, been reinstalling and updating my IE . guess it's not only my issue now.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-05-15T03:34:01.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot is aware, it's being worked on.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The RobbieRotten","date":"2017-05-15T02:04:53.754+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems like its down.
