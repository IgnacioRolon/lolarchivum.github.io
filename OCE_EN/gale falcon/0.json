Playing on a lower end laptop with mimimal graphics, etc, and have found the game mostly runs fine and is a lot more tolerable in terms of the playerbase. Which is nice.\r\n\r\n...Until a couple dragons have been killed and all of a sudden the map \"evolves.\" For the majority of them, I get a little bit of fps drop but the game is still playable. However, the Ocean Drake's permutation of the map, particularly with the added rain effects, etc, practically turns the game into a slideshow. Any time a teamfight, etc starts, I might as well mash the keyboard and hope (more so than usual) because I can barely figure out what's going on. \r\n\r\nIs anyone else having this issue on lower end machines? Or in general? I'm not complaining so much as raising awareness, as I'm well aware my specs are kinda garbage as far as League is concerned nowadays. Just makes me wonder if there are some problems with optimisation regarding the map changes, etc.\r\n\r\n:)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-12-29T01:33:43.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure how much it will help, but if you have eye candy turned on try turning that off (Video options, can only be accessed in-game). I believe the draconic maps have more than standard summoner's rift, so turning that off may be enough to tip the scales.\n\nA clean reinstall may also help simply by cleaning out any old unused files. Cleaning out your hard-drive may also help if it is getting full.\n\nOther options that may help:\n\n1. \"Low Spec Mode\" and/or \"Close client during game\". (Client > General)\n2. Screen Shake (Video)\n3. Windowed Mode: Fullscreen (Video)\n4. Anti-Aliasing (Video)\n5. Ambience Sound. (In-Game > Sound)\n6. HUD animations (In-Game > Interface)\n7. Smooth Camera (In-game > Game) (Sometimes this option is needed on lower spec machines though).\n\n(You shouldn't need all of them so change the ones that impact you the least first).\n\nFailing all that, submit a ticket to player support and they should be able to help you further: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
