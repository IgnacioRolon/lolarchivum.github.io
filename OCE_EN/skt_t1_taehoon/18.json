this might just sound like a rant but i have been putting off asking for help about a number of problems with league of legends and if a riot member could help me out it would be useful now before i start with the list of problems i would just like to add these problems have lead to me spending at least 50 hours in low priority queues which is not   fun \n\nloading screen not showing up for ages \n\nI started a game and the like logo that appears when u click on league of legends on your task bar didn't  show up for 5 mins so i wouldn't  even start loading into the game 5 mins of afk = 1 out of 2 games closer to lbs  this has been going on since patch 5.4 and its really annoying because i just want to play some lol even tho im not that good lol is the funnest part of my day but i have to wait so long for a game \n\n\n  league closing down while in low priority queue\n\nI'm doing a lbs because of problem 1 and half way or mid way through the queue lol stops working and closes it self down which means more time without playing  and having to wait before you can play a game is just horrible because people just want to play and while in the queue you cant talk to any one which sucks even more \n\n\n  TOXIC/ FLAMERS players\n\nNow here is a big problem not so much a bug more of a VIRUS and it is  TOXIC/FLAMERS these people make games negative they only think its words but it can really effect some players i would know my best mate used to be plat 3 he dies 3 times in a ranked game and he got kicked out of his team and abused verbally for days until he stopped playing all together  which is sad cos he was a great player  i would also like to link this too people who instalok and then threatening  to feed if they don&#039;t get they lane  this just sucks even more now that champion mastery is live \n\n Random/ never ending ping spikes \n\ngoing in to lane yay i got a good looking team good support jungle is ganking yay oh wait whats that frame rate dropping wtf is happening ping 1000+ now its not just me i know other players have really high ping spikes but never  ending spikes just doesnt work out well for a adc now i know this is a huge problem but after each patch it seems to get worse than before \n\n\nWhen a new patch comes out scanning files scanning files \n\nSo new patch comes out everyone&#039;s wanted to see what riot has nerfed this time (cant wait for the ashe rework) but then i go away for like 10 mins come back to my desk im like sweet lol should be ready now and nope scanning files it gets to about 16k files normally in stage one stage two not so bad but 2 hours of scanning files is not okay its a waste of time and most of the time in the patches it small things being changed and hardly ever bug \n\nLeague just wont work \n\nNow this is my biggest problem each night before i can play a game without disconnecting or not even loading into the rift i have to wait two hours without playing even without lbs or league just wont work my laptop is about 3 months old so its not my laptop and its really annoying because i just want to play teemo \n\n\nLow Priority Queue  \n\nNow come on guys you made it so that if one person disconnects in a co-op vs Ai game one of the bots goes afk too so why should someone get lbs for leaving a bot game it doesn't effect your team because a bot goes afk too so its 4v4  so i think the whole Low Priority Queue should be updated taking off bots and only put on normals and ranked \n\n\n Summoner icons and skins\n\nokay so who doesn't want a TSM  or SKT T1  icon well even tho icons are only 250 rp i think they should be able to be bought with ip lets say a 250rp icon is 1000 ip. \n\nnow skin for your best champion now skisn even tho many of them are cheap i think like my idea for icons skins should be able to be bought with ip as well lets say 250rp = 1000 ip thats a fair scale so that would be a really great update \n\n\nwell thats just a list of many problems and ideas i have for a patch to any riot members who see this it would really help if we could have a chat or you help me out with my problems on this discussion thank you and to all you fans who are still over whelmed by SKT T1 losing to EDG in the MSI  i say if faker was on the first two games SKT T1 would of won in my books but thats just me thank you to who ever reads this \n\n\nLIVE LONG AND LOVE
