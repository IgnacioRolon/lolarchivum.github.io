However,  AFK for ranked which is[ treated far more severely than the other modes.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ#h1q2)\n\nLeaver buster is an automated system and can't tell the difference between an intentional and unintentional disconnections (hence why you don't usually get punished after one leave).\n\n It does however kick in after 5mins of afk because even the shortest period of DC can make or break a game and is enough to negatively impact on the other 9 players. We also have /remake now, so that if the dc occurs during champ select or loading screen (because sometimes games go through even when you dc in champ select), you team wont have to play awkwardly through until the late player catches up if they do connect. \n\nIf you are having trouble with you client crashing during champ select, please check out some of the [following help pages](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664)\n\nIf all else fails, please send in a [support ticket ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)and explain the crashes and see if one of the support staff can help you. Please keep in mind that they will not take you out of low priority queue. \nAlso please keep in mind that it may take a lil while for them to answer your question (up to 72 hours), but please do not send more than one ticket/add more info to your ticket as you wait in as it will push your enquiry to the back of the queue and you will have to wait longer.","replies":[]}]}
