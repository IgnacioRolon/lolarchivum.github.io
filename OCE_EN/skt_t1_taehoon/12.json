Turns out gift for gift is fake and I am a retard but I politely removed him from my friends list then only a few weeks later to start getting random friend requests again I accepted them opened them in chat and asked &quot;hi I don&#039;t remember you, have we played before&quot; and every time I would get abusive reply so I would just block them(half of the 98 blocked players on my account are him and his goons) now it didn&#039;t stop every month new accounts popped up all with weird summoner names and lately when I ask who they are they say a old school friend. Now this is how I tell that they are lying as the fact that I was home schooled now I know Riot does a iPhone track ban on Tyler1 and Ik why Tyler1 is a toxic abusive troll that is alot like _Real Name Removed_ now all I want is for league to be a good place for me to connect with people all around oce in game and have fun even tho I&#039;m bronze #BronzeAndProud I still think that this game should be fun. _Real Name Removed_ has admitted to boosting people before which I&#039;m pretty sure is against the summoner code. In conclusion I&#039;m tired of him having his goons add me and abuse me feel free to read my chat logs with _Name Removed_ and others like him I think you guys have the power to do that any ways some feed back from a actual rioter would be nice","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-14T08:40:26.508+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey **im a teemo**,\n\nJust wanted to remind you that 'Naming and Shaming' is against the [board rules](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules). You also used real names in this post which is absolutely not allowed and actually quite dangerous.\n\nYou're always welcome to talk about in-game incidents like this, but **you must leave out summoner names (and real names too).** If you 'name and shame' again you will be temporarily banned from the boards.","replies":[{"poster":"SKT T1 Taehoon","date":"2016-12-15T07:04:00.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also would like to say Umm good job you helped out in no way all you did was reinforce a rule and I get my post hit Wtf go read the posts almost every 20/100 have  names in them yet you hit me with the removal freedom of speech ovbs doesn't exist here aye and you guys wonder why the league community is so toxic","replies":[{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2016-12-16T04:47:05.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=im a teemo ,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=MgjjA1iJ,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2016-12-15T07:04:00.648+0000)\n>\n> freedom of speech ovbs doesn't exist here aye\n\nFirstly, Australia doesn't have freedom of speech. It has freedom of expression. If you're going to get on your high horse at least get the terminology right.\n\nSecondly, if you're sick of being abused when you accept random friend requests, then maybe stop accepting random friend requests? Like it's all well and good to say this guy and his cronies shouldn't be doing this, which is true, but you're also sort of enabling them to do so.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SKT T1 Taehoon","date":"2016-12-15T07:05:05.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also would like to say Umm good job you helped out in no way all you did was reinforce a rule and I get my post hit Wtf go read the posts almost every 20/100 have  names in them yet you hit me with the removal freedom of speech ovbs doesn't exist here aye and you guys wonder why the league community is so toxic also you used my name in your reply I think I better report it for the fact your using my name on a post","replies":[{"poster":"nochillgamer","date":"2016-12-15T07:55:41.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=im a teemo ,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=MgjjA1iJ,comment-id=00010002,timestamp=2016-12-15T07:05:05.756+0000)\n>\n> Also would like to say Umm good job you helped out in no way all you did was reinforce a rule and I get my post hit Wtf go read the posts almost every 20/100 have  names in them yet you hit me with the removal freedom of speech ovbs doesn&#x27;t exist here aye and you guys wonder why the league community is so toxic also you used my name in your reply I think I better report it for the fact your using my name on a post\n\nLOL dude I reinforce the rules to as many people as possible because I want to make the boards a better and more comfortable place for everyone.
