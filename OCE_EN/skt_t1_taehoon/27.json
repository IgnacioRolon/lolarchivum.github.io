IDK, send a support ticket. They might review the game or ask you to send your game logs so they can check for errors that may have caused this.\n\n If the black screen happens again, all you have to do is restart your client and get back into game (it takes like 2 mins tops).\n\nBTW,** spending money entitles you to nothing**. You don't even own your account. (read the terms of service)\n\nAlso, your poll is invalid because there are separate teams for skin and champ design and those who deal with the bugs.
