Like one game I created a custom game for myself with no bots/players/no ip xp gain/anything and I wanted to practice flashing, but I had to wait every 300 seconds for this. This doesn&#039;t seem very conventional and uncomfortable to practice.\r\n\r\nwe could test so many things with this i mean no ie or xp for it but still being able to do anything you want spawning in minions or bots trying all sorts of builds up straight training \r\n\r\nso people can learn champions and being able to play any champion owned or not owned cos i now as a fact people play lets say zed when hes free to play ( please put zed free to play soon) and think wow zeds so op and easy so they save for him buy him and then  finds  out it was luck when he played him before so being able to test a champion would help u make sure its worth you spending your hard saved 6300 ip and like a sandbox mode to help you learn would make ranked so much better i mean no more first timers so you would know you&#039;ve actually  got a chance of getting out of bronze this year.\r\n\r\nsame idea with skin you see omg new sona skin 3150 rp (idk price its a guess ) you say its so cool buys it then see its in agem and for some reason doesnt like it so with this sandbox mode you can try skins that you are thinking of buying \r\n\r\nokay yea its alot like urf but urf comes once a year for about 2 weeks everyone has fun playing urf but its comes and goes to soon  so having a sandbox mode its like we&#039;ve got urf without players but wtf its still fun being able to flash every 10 seconds and planting shrooms everywhere to spell out nerf me plz riot \r\n\r\nIt would be really helpful if you could implement the sandbox mode with no cds cos then we can {{summoner:4}}  all the  way to barone for days \r\nshroom to spell words like nerf me and rito \r\n \r\ngiving us the power of doom bots so when {{champion:99}}  ults it does what doom bot lux does or maybe even being able to spawn in doom bots making a god mode like in most other games \r\n\r\nstarting the game with 100k gold to test out builds and plays if you want ap you open a menu and add it to your champion {{champion:45}}  with 1500 ap dam son \r\n\r\nbeing able to be the ultimate {{champion:245}}  turning back time as far as you want to make replays and other cool videos and stuff i mean this mode would blow up everyone would be on it if you make this mode which i hope you do i dont ask for any thanks for the idea just a little gift from you guys which would be to never take it away from us  \r\n\r\nso if you could put this mode into like pbe testing it would be really cool\r\n\r\n\r\nthank you \r\n\r\nps: if any riot member actually reads this plz consider this i mean alot of people would like this i bet ya :)","replies":[{"poster":"csm","date":"2015-07-06T08:00:13.736+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"IS there any logical reason as to why \"custom games\" aren't custom at all?\n\nI played quake 3 in 2005, and you could literally change every aspect of the game, from gravity, move speed, projectile/bullet speed, fire rate and just about anything else you can think of. And quake came out around 1999-2000. Why can't the most played game on the planet offer more when it comes to custom games?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Focus On End","date":"2015-07-04T15:19:01.932+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes this would be fun, but riot dont like things that distract people from their addiction to ranked. however fun it may be.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-07-04T10:04:21.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just bring URF Mode back.
