I can understand why in game the move descriptions might be a little vague, otherwise it is just confusing with a bunch of numbers and whatnot. But by this point in the game&#039;s life there should be at least an in-client description of exactly what the moves do with exactly what ratios and scaling they have, and exactly what kind of interactions they have (eg. Gangplank q not applying Luden&#039;s Echo). I don&#039;t think that&#039;s too much to ask for and i think it is a little silly that i would have to go to a third party website to find out what kind or scaling i have, or just estimate it in game. At least someone tell me this is in the works..","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-04-28T17:55:04.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So Gangplank's Q is the only technically melee attack that is blocked by Yasuo's Windwall?\nMind blown.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-04-29T02:56:07.998+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, since it's the only projectile \"melee\" attack I suppose that's true.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-04-29T09:00:40.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=kJs,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=1OeIfWEp,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-04-28T17:55:04.718+0000)\n>\n> So Gangplank's Q is the only technically melee attack that is blocked by Yasuo's Windwall?\n> Mind blown.\n\nyou are forgetting every other ranged champ","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-04-29T09:59:14.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Range champions aren't **melee** brother.

It's literally just a ranged AA with slightly extra damage and a gold benefit. It doesn't even say in the description that it's melee.\n\nAs for the actual topic, I don't think it's necessary to have complete rundowns in the client of what everything does. Having it all in the client allows people to spend heaps of time just looking through descriptions and ratios and whatnot and determining a perfect build/runes/masteries/skill order or whatever, which I think shouldn't happen. In my opinion, players should be made to figure out all this stuff through experience in the game with whatever Champions they want to learn.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-04-29T02:58:59.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> It doesn't even say in the description that it's melee.\n\nIt doesn't say it **is** a melee attack, it says it counts as a melee attack.\n> Parrrley can crit and applies on hit effects as if a melee basic attack.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AnArtillerySpec","date":"2015-04-29T02:58:08.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So by hovering your mouse over the ability ingame, those numbers provided aren't accurate?\n(Or are those numbers only there vs AI/bot games?
