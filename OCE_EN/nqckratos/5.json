For the record, it always fired from your attached ally's position not yours, but as to any other differences you feel, I couldn't say. I don't notice anything, but I'm far from a Yuumi main.","replies":[{"poster":"nqcKratos","date":"2019-06-17T10:54:32.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think i was just wrong.
