Playing dominion games on NA now doesnt count towards the icon in general.\n\nFrom the NA post\n\"For players who’ve made the Crystal Scar their home over the last four years, we’ll be taking a snapshot of the queue today just before this post goes live. Then we’ll give out an exclusive, never-to-be-reproduced Summoner Icon to anyone with over 100 wins in matchmade Dominion games (not including Co-op vs AI). \"\n\nThe icon is intended to represent the commitment those players with 100, 500, or even a 1000+ wins invested into the map.

I'm at 82 dominion wins and I'd like to imagine that if I had just been given the chance to play Dominion that I may have reached that magic 100, or maybe more than that. I'm sure I share this feeling with other OCE veterans and I guess we'd like the rules bent a little if it was possible.
