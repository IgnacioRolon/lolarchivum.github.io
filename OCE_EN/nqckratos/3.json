I think it feels exciting when you open a crate because you worked for those three key fragments, but i have to say as someone who has spent probably around 2k on this game over the years, getting that champion shard when you own every champion and it can only be disenchanted into champion essence feels like a kick to the nuts. It feels like being punished for having played the game a lot and spending money on it, ESPECIALLY when you buy a key for rp...\r\n\r\nI know riot has something in mind for this, i just wanted to make this post more to vent my frustration, and just to remind riot that loyal customers are being punished and that maybe it should be a priority to change that.","replies":[{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2016-04-22T13:12:17.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry bro! If you have not heard yet then I shall tell you. Rito has already regarded this situation and they are working on something if you already have all the champions. If I recall correctly in the near future you can turn champion shards into skin shards (IF YOU OWN ALL THE CHAMPS). Hopefully this would actually happen. Just save them up for future use ^^ {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-04-22T11:25:05.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally as someone who doesn't quite own all the champion shards I don't mind as much getting champion shards as long as I can get one that is worth at least 4800 as these champions generally take a fair amount of effort to acquire. Though I definitely do see your point, that after everyone has acquired all champions it becomes fundamentally pointless to acquire more champions or that if you don't gain a single champion of high value then it's like money wasted and being punished for it or if you're simply after skins and there isn't a single champion that you want.  Hopefully the system that riot comes up with will fix that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-04-22T10:51:35.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL every 1 but me seems to have gotten champ shards, 7 chests nothing but skin shards, lucky me.\n\nViscero Xin skin\nAmethyst Ashe Skin\nInfernal Nasus skin\nGodyr\nWarring Kingdom Kat skin\nMech ward \nGong ward\n\nThen the auto skins\nCelestine Soraka skin\nRito fist pump","replies":[]}]}
