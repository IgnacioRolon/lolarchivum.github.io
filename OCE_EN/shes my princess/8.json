Twitch chat always gonna be distasteful toward it, but they&#039;ve done a fantastic job talking for near on two whole hours for 13 minutes of gameplay. Sincerest praise to the casters; I hope they get paid extra either in monetary terms or genuine thankfulness from the Riot staff.","replies":[{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-08-26T11:12:18.800+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"100% agree","replies":[]},{"poster":"CptStupendous","date":"2015-08-27T02:43:38.122+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1 on this for sure!","replies":[]},{"poster":"SaggyErection","date":"2015-08-26T11:31:44.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what happen to the stream?","replies":[{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-08-26T11:42:38.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They turned it off. \n\nThe match will be remade.
