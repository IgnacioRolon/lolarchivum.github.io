This seem rather toxic regardless if its a banter with the \"I pray to god you get ***** murdered tonight- this seems to be a very and I mean a very toxic statement to say and because riot's policy does not tolerate this kind of behaviour (which most people usually get away with it) they deem the player toxic to the extent bannable. \n\nMost likely the reason why you got banned (and so did my friend which in I.R.L he's actually a kind and cool lad) is that KYS is what my knowledge limits to is encouraging summoners towards a negative atmosphere or encouragement of a serious case (regardless whether it be banter or literal insult) the comments (totally forgotten the word) doesn't show the irony or humor without the explanation or context behind it but when Riot reads over this they would best catergorise this under toxicity.\n\nIt shouldnt be a perma-ban (if I'm correct) if the other summoner did not take serious consideration about it, however theres been no other information but I don't distrust you in your sense of banter,  but given the comments you have given then its seriously looks like insults rather than banter.\n\n\n\nAnd to anyone who thinks I don't understand the Kys scenario- reminder that I have dealt and is currently dealign with depresso  espresso and dealt with this kind of case whether it be banter or insult by a unreasonable summoner.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-01-05T00:08:38.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"some keywords = instaban now, irrespective of context.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alvin Xiong1","date":"2017-12-12T10:22:28.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just recently finished a game and this Lux support won her game and told me to kys after the game and left. I'm going to be real upset if they don't ban her/his profit permanently. People need to understand that just cause it's online it doesn't affect people. In reality yes it does affect other gamers. What if you told someone to kys and they actually did, or what if you don't know their only escape of pain is video games and you tell them to kys and they do it. So with this meme of kys I honestly think people should take consideration and stop the kys stuff cause it's really not cool and it's really immature especially if you say you have common sense but you still use it.
