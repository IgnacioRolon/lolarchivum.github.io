I feel as though I get verbally abused over the silliest things in games.. and I make reports, often with details about whats happened and despite the new system being in place I have never receieved any feedback about anything happening at all. It&#039;s beginning to get really disheartening. I can admit I make a LOT of reports but I&#039;ve never made a false one. I also don&#039;t think my record can be too bad as I&#039;ve never had any form of ban/restriction and have also recieved the skins for being a good member of the community.","replies":[]}
