What happens is when I am a queue and a match pops up, I either don&#039;t see the box at all or see it momentarily and the box will disappear and it will take me out of queue, saying I have failed to respond. I can still play but it takes a couple of queues to get set up and as you know that can be extremely frustrating. I don&#039;t know how to fix it, but if any of you have any idea it would be really helpful.\r\n\r\nhttp://forums.oce.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=12265","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-11-19T22:25:18.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey PineAbe,\n\nCan you give the solutions in this article a shot?\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes#section-mac","replies":[{"poster":"PineAbe","date":"2015-11-21T11:43:26.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really think that is what I am looking for sorry.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-11-21T16:03:59.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These are some solutions that worked for some people who had the same problem:\n>Greetings,\nI had this problem before, what I did:\n1) Configured my FireWall and antivirus to allow League of Legends and all Its features. If you cannot, check this (https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/20132793-Firewall-Configuration-for-League-of-Legends)article. - this was the main fix, but before that tried many things, I will list some of them.\n2) Running the whole game as administrator. This can be done by simply clicking right button on the Launcher shortcut and then \"run as administrator\".\n3) Checked my Internet Explorer settings and if the scripts are allowed (they should be).\n4) Updated Adobe Air.\nAlso, if these solutions do not help, 'Repair' the game via the launcher or just completely reinstall it.\nGood Luck!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
