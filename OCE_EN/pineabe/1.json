This usually occurs whenever I try to use chat or back. And also occurs inbetween whenever random shit triggers it. This frame drop drops to 0 frames so it is quite frustrating to deal with for 4 seconds.\r\n\r\nTo my knowledge it is due to the new update screwing over mac full screen mode. I noticed that full screen doesn&#039;t work as it used to. I used run hot corners and never had an issue with them activating in game before but now they do. Whenever i tab in and out my screen goes white partially. Something that does not usually happen.\r\n\r\nIs this fixable using my settings or do I simply need to wait till Riot fixes their spaghetti code.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve lost too many games and received a low priority queue for this so until someone has a definitive fix I don&#039;t want to play anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"PineAbe","date":"2017-01-14T06:43:38.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i will also add I have a retina display mac.","replies":[{"poster":"PineAbe","date":"2017-01-14T06:48:53.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"windowed / borderless mode work fine","replies":[]}]}]}
