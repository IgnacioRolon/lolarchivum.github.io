I am aware that a change to its active was meant to be happening this patch however it was not posted anywhere within the patchnotes. This change has made it so that instead of what I assume was meant to be 38% however it is currently set to 3800% which effectively makes your entire team immune for 2.5seconds(if you want to argue that this is not op try playing with it) in comparison zhonya&#039;s{{item:3157}} (a very common and good item) only affects one person for this amount of time and prevents them from moving and attacking. I am aware that there is a 8second cooldown between uses of this active so it cannot be stacked effectively however 1 alone is insane and with 2 or 3 on a team it can turn a losing game into an overwhelming victory.\nproof of this here\nhttps://imgur.com/a/X4dU8\n\nThis has to be an unintentional change and needs to be hot fixed asap as it will drastically favor those who are aware of it and take advantage of it.\n\nPlease bring attention to this as it needs to be dealt with as soon as possible.\n\nAll credit for this discovery goes to \"dr etonz\"","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-11T00:29:03.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The functionality wasn't changed, only the tool tip (the PBE tooltip got shipped by accident), and so far as I know it's meant to be 38% not 3800%.\n\nThat said Help and Support isn't the place to post bug reports:\n\n>DO NOT post bug reports here.
