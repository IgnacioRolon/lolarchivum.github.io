LFM Platinum +","subforum":"Team Recruitment","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello everyone,\nIt is I, the famous TKNS Penguin. I am a former member of The Knights which is currently under disbandment. I have carried many competitive teams such as the Knights to victory, and am looking to create a team of my own. That&#039;s right, the team will be called The Peasants and I am looking for Platinum + players to join the team, hopefully we can compete in some online tournaments and have a shot at the League of Legends Open Ladder. We will also be playing some Dynamic Ranked to improve our teamwork and communication skills :)\n\nI am looking for friendly players who are interested in exchanging high levels of banter and pulling off great plays as a team which is what I believe is the best way to become a good team. If this is what you envisioned within a team, now is your chance to sign up.\n\nOur current roster is as follows:\nTop: TKNS Penguin\nJungle: -\nMid: -\nADC: -\nSupport: -\n\nSubstitutes:\nSub 1: -\nSub 2: -\n\nTeam Janitor/Cleaner: RHIN0\nTeam Janitor/Cleaner 2: TKNS Dom1nAtAr\nTeam Mascot: TKNS Diamond\nTeam Farmer: Stigjamm & TKNS Diamond\nTeam Coach: TKNS Diamond\n\nIf you are interested in signing up for The Peasants, feel free to leave a comment below or add me through the League of Legends Client. Thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"ClouDy","date":"2016-01-30T02:33:12.709+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Penguin.\n\nI am your biggest fan. When you filled in for Dyrus during the group stages of worlds, wow. I was extremely impressed. It's great to see that you're starting a team up and you're back in OCE!\n\nI'd apply for the team, but I'm afraid of looking sub-par in comparison to you, it disgusts me how lowly I am when I watch you play.\n\nI would like nothing more than your manhood drizzled down my cheek and rubbed into my hairy chest. Please oblige, always yours.\n\nLove, ClouDy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RageBlade","date":"2016-01-26T22:03:15.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dear TKNS Penguin\n\nMid lane main, please add ATG Demonslayer.
