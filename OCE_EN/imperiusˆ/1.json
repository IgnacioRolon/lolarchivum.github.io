It&#039;s a problem which I&#039;m sure everyone that plays League of Legends is familiar with. Nearly every game I get there is a toxic player who complains, and it is extremely annoying. I have aspirations of becoming a professional League of Legends player, and my first step is to climb to a high elo. This goal is being prevented by the amount of trolls and idiots who don&#039;t want to win the game. The overwhelming volume of racism, ableism, bigotry and toxicity is too much to deal with and it is affecting the growth and fanbase of the game. It&#039;s simple - a 7 day ban the first time they commit an offence and then a permanent suspension. Far too many of these players get away with trash talking, and think it&#039;s okay to be toxic because they&#039;re cowardly sitting behind a computer screen. \r\n\r\nGiven the small population in higher elo such as Diamond (~1500), the toxic players are easily distinguished from the rest. If you could make an effort to properly punish them, that would be great. Ban the pricks and encourage a more competitive and friendly environment. Thank you!\r\n\r\nAlso on a side note, when I open up &#039;Advanced Details&#039; in the end of game lobby, I notice that every Ivern&#039;s &#039;&#039;Damage Dealt&#039;&#039; is significantly inflated to around 300-500k each game. It doesnt seem accurate and I think it&#039;s a minor thing Riot needs to fix.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-04-23T12:36:55.430+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Imperiuš\n\nWhile its true that we all have to deal with toxic players, and no one likes that, there are a great many non-toxic players out there. In your post you say you get a toxic player per game, even if that is no exaggeration and you do literally get one every game, thats still 9 players every game that are good and trying their hardest.\n\nImagine you're a police officer, in a room there are 10 people, one of them is a criminal. You have a gun, you can shoot at the criminal, but in a crowded room, you have a 1 in 10 chance of hitting him and a 9 in 10 chance of killing an innocent. That isn't good odds.\nIs it worth causing the death of innocents to kill a single criminal?\n\nRiot's methods don't shoot the criminal _(e.g. instant permanent ban)_, they use more non-lethal methods like a Taser _(2 week ban)_, or a tackle _(a chat restriction)_. While these methods don't 100% get rid of the criminal, they vastly reduce the risk of unjustly permanently punishing an innocent.\n\nIt's all very well to say \"We need harsher restrictions!\", \"We need to ban people permanently!\". But the system cant see into our individual souls, it can and does punish people who don't deserve it. \nWe can say \"Well thats just the way it is.\", \"Tough luck!\". \"its a price we need to pay to get rid of the toxicity\". But when it's **your** $800+ account that you spend 5 hours a day on, gets banned, just because the system 'missed'. I guarantee you wont say \"Oh well, its just one of those things.\"\n\nWe all have bad days. \nI have had every honour ribbon twice (once on NA and once on OCE), and I have been lucky enough to be chosen for a Purple name on the boards, I like to help out my team both by positive attitude and advice. \nBut in my time playing league, I have still sworn at other players, or gave them an earful for screwing up. Just purely because I've had a terrible day at uni, or because I'm in a bad mindset because of something that happened.\nIt doesn't happen often at all, but when it does, I am not proud, and I wish I could take it back. I have spent a LOT of money on league, and even more importantly, a lot of time. I love this game, and If my account were to be permanently banned because of one or two occasions where I lost my cool, I would be devastated.\n\nAnd there are countless other players like me, who love this game to bits. No one is perfect, every single one of us has said something we shouldn't have online. If we have too harsh restrictions, innocents will lose their accounts forever. People who collect rare skins will lose their collection, players with 1,000,000+ mastery points on their main will be reset to 0. People who bought every champion with IP will have to spend years and years working to get them all back again.\n\nIs it ready worth that, just to get rid of 1 in 10 toxic people, who most likely will just make a new account anyway?\n\n\n_______\n\nThere should be punishment for bad behaviour, don't get me wrong! No community on earth works perfectly without it, and for all the effort Riot and the players put in, we all deserve to play in a positive community. \nBut the systems currently in place are good at figuring out which players are truly toxic, and which players just have bad days. But like any good detective, it takes a lot longer than just pointing the finger at the last guy to insult you. and so the 'criminals' are on the streets a little longer than they should be. BUT there are far fewer innocent casualties.\n\nRiot are good at their jobs _(we all complain about aspects of the game, but when you actually step back and look at it as a whole, it is a true masterpiece!)_ They aren't blind to the problems, nor are they ignorant of the solutions. But each action they make has ripples, and they have to carefully think about what effects these ripples will have. \nPermabanning players for their second offence WILL get rid of most toxic players, but the ripples that causes _(banning innocents, and scaring people away from playing or communicating at all)_ would be far greater tragedies that not punishing a few toxic players.\n\n\n_______\n\nIf i would give any advice that could help with the toxicity for you right now, it would be to not retaliate at the toxic players, or let them wind you up. But instead put all your effort into complementing and helping the players that aren't toxic, not only will that help their playing (and maybe even make their day). It will also put you in a better frame of mind. (saying nice things makes you feel good, while saying and things just makes yourself feel bad as well).\nWho knows, it may encourage more people to be less toxic. :)\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-04-24T06:18:29.282+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just to add onto this, there is no silver bullet to solving online behaviour.

I haven't had an outbreak like that since, and I like to think I'm now a positive or neutral player in every game :)\n\nPeople like me 3 years ago, are the vast majority of what people see as \"toxic players\". That's why Riot's system is designed to help reform players first, rather than evict or ban them instantly. That's not to say there isn't a small population of scumbags who really should be banned ASAP though.

On the other hand, if you perm ban that person, they just simply make a new account and are likely to continue being toxic.
