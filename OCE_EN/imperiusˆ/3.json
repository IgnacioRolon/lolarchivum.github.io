In Challenger, all the players I know have above 60 fps and a stable internet connection, and low Bronze having poor framerates and ping. \r\n\r\nI play on constant 30 fps and 60 ping, and am Diamond IV in Solo Queue. Do you guys think FPS and ping have a strong influence on your rank and gameplay?","replies":[]}
