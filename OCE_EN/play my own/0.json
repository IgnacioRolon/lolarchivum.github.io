private, you have no way of confirming whether or not punishment was issued to another player and they have no way of knowing you received one until you share it. This is intentional and is done for a number of reasons. Chief among them privacy,  reform, and to prevent witch-hunting.\n\nWhile there is a notification that will sometimes appear when your report has contributed to the punishment of a player, it is very limited, and not designed to be any form of confirmation or reliable data. It is only intended as a small bonus. Seeing the popup means a player was punished, but not seeing it does not mean the opposite, only that the conditions for the popup weren't met.\n\n> the one who played properly and tried the best to win got suspended\n\nYour gameplay has nothing to do with this punishment. The fact that you received a chat log and not a match history or replay in the reform card should make this obvious. \n\nWhether you went 11/0 or 0/11 is irrelevant in this case (assuming you weren't intentionally feeding). What *is* relevant is calling people dogs, explicit and vulgar insults on people's very existence, threatening open lanes, and generally being racist.\n\nSuch behaviour is not tolerated in this community. If you continue to engage in such behaviour, you will ultimately be removed from the community (assuming that this is not a permanent suspension, in which case you would have received an explicit warning of this already). Those are the rules you agree to in order to play this game whether you agree with the principle or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Play My Own","date":"2019-03-26T05:23:45.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"which word(s) get me suspended then?

While the words \"Australian\" and \"dogs\" are nothing bad *on their own*, when they're combined (and particularly with a word such as \"stupid\") it becomes something that is just not acceptable in this community.
