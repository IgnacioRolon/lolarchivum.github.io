You know when your team gets cocky while you&#039;re carrying them and refuses to end the game allowing the enemy team to catch up. My assists alone are higher then everybody&#039;s combined kills+assists except for Jinx.\r\n\r\nBut yer... 4 enemy dead with super minions in their base? Better turn around and do baron instead of winning the game, followed by 20 minutes of lost fights and bickering.

But I can say with confidence that I was extremely influential in the victory. Wish LoL had replays (the 3rd party one is buggy and lags me)","replies":[]}]}
