I mean, it is possible, its just really really hard and there are easier ways to go about it. \n\nHere is an answer that I wrote for a similar question a couple of days ago:\n\n>1. **Join a premade team** (as you have already acknowledged, it is the best way to climb).\nBronze V is the ultimate cesspit for trolls and people who play like bots. Playing ranked is like dipping your hand into medical waste and hoping you don't get hepatitis. Playing as a ranked 5 will definitely lessen your chances of being matched with trollers/afks/other toxins. It also allows you to become familiar with the play patterns of your teammates (so you don't have to keep adjusting your style every game) and you have way better communication. With the implementation of a dynamic queue where this is possible, there is literally no reason not to. You also get lots of cool bonuses like extra IP, mastery points and Hextech stuff (soon™).\n>\n>2. **Play comfort picks rather than counter picks.**\nA lot of people in bronze get caught up in trying to play counter picks, even if they have no idea how to play the champion. Same happens when the \"FOTM OP\" isn't banned. A lot of people are going to be playing \"op\" champs in order to get out, and the likelihood of them sucking is high (look at all the bronze v vaynes and yasuos). Playing a comfort pick means that you will not only have better matchup and skill knowledge, it means that you have more options on how you want to play (aggro/safe/roam). Keep in mind that your comfort picks may be banned, I would suggest picking up a couple of champs (also helpful if you are last pick and your team is missing something like a tank).\n>\n>3.** Get super good at two roles**.\nDynamic queue allows you to choose two roles, so you have 100% chance of getting of your fave/best roles. Pick up a few comfort champs in each, learn all there is to know about them so you know things like build paths and matchups like the back of your hand.\n>\n>**4. Revisit some of the basic league skills.**\nThings like [CS](http://imgur.com/orWUCKH), [warding](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/support-guide-map-control-warding-344910), positioning, [teamcomps](http://www.liquidlegends.net/forum/lol-strategy/476270-picks-and-bans-understanding-team-compositions), and [being a nice person and encouraging your team](http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/summoners-code/). If you need help with some of this, you could[ consider hiring a coach](http://www.lol-coaching.com). \n>\n>Note: also check your masteries and rune pages are the best they can be.\n>\n>5.** Keep a ranked diary. **\nMost of my improvement comes from my ranked diary. After every game I write down who I was playing, my score, CS, wards placed, LP gained/lost and a quick summary of the game. I also like to write down 3 things I did well, and 3 things I need to improve. That way, you are really processing the game and learning from your mistakes. It also gives you something to consciously work towards improving in the next game.\n\nGood luck, may the elo be ever in your favour ♥","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-03-13T05:22:06.754+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"After looking through your match history, I would suggest you main top, and have your secondary role set to mid. \n\nPotential top lane champ pool:\n{{champion:78}} - for times when your team needs a tank, you also seem to be doing really well with her.\n{{champion:41}} - Tonnes of damage, you also seem to be doing well with him.\n{{champion:24}} / {{champion:39}} - Good picks, doing well with these will boost your ability to carry greatly.\n\n_I would personally stay away from nasus, just because low elo games often are stomps and you wont necessarily have time to get the stacks to do well._\n\nPotential mid lane champ pool:\n{{champion:38}} - Great kassadin, lots of bronze don't know how to deal with him.\n{{champion:103}} - tonnes of damage, great mobility, burst potential, \n{{champion:1}} - cheap ,easy, so much damage (smurfs mage of choice), A+ for when your team needs some CC.\n\n[Gotta play less champions so you can focus really hard on the ones you do play.](http://imgur.com/cv6OcXR)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-03-13T03:37:19.942+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bronze: Focus on ONE (or two) role(s). and ONE OR TWO champions in that Role. Become a god at those champions and get out of Bronze.\n\nThe mistake new (and bad) players make is trying to be like \"the pros\" and have a big champion pool. You need to focus on 1 or 2 champions and become gods at that champion.\n\nAlso always remember that not every game in winnable and most people (even the highest challenger players) only have a 55% winrate. So you will be losing a lot of games, dont let it get to you.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nWhen I started playing in Season 4, I got placed in Bronze 2. I didn't really know how to play properly and probably jumped into ranked too early (like most people). But I watched streams, some youtubers and learned to play and got to Silver 3.\n\nIMO: If you are good Nasus you can win easily. The BIG problem with him though (right now) is that the games are very snowbally and he is a champion that simply wants your team to not feed for 20 mins then you 3 hit everyone. Problem is by 20 mins the game is usually something like 7-31 and you've lost an inhib.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\n\nIf you want the real CHEESY way out of Bronze. AOE and CC. {{champion:32}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:9}}{{champion:85}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:62}} .\nBronze people don't think \"hey lets not bunch up for Leona/Amumu\" they think \"Push mid, streamer I watched always grouped mid\".\n\nIf you play with (or against) someone you think, \"Hey, that guy was good\".

Focus on getting ahead and then snowballing other lanes, if you play top and you're ahead gank bot then take turret/dragon if successful pick champions that are meta but can gank lanes and pair with other lanes well e.g. Naut Top, say you get ahead early in top either in lane control or kills, walk down mid when you hit 6 and try to force a flash or kill, just keep pressuring them make them feel scared when you disappear off of the map this will relieve pressure for your team mates making it easier to lane for them. It's kinda hard to carry unless you win lane so try and improve on laning, it also helps to know when you should take objectives etc. \n\nAlso cheese like crazy play panth, do level 2 cheese ganks, invade etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-03-13T03:25:47.496+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"If you are stuck in Bronze 5 and want to get out, I hate to be the one to say this, but you can't.\n\nBeing stuck in Silver 1 or Gold 3 and wanting to get to Diamond, sure, we can give you some hints as to how to get climb in ranked, but stuck in Bronze 5, that is as low as you can go. Fair enough if you start that low and climb out, fine, you could have had a bad start in the placements, but being stuck there doesn't really show how bad you actually are because there is nothing lower to show your real skill other than you admitting you are stuck there.\n\nI have to say this as mean as it sounds, STOP PLAYING RANKED YA BASTARD! Seriously, if you are stuck there, you are a part of the reason you are stuck there. The ranked queues that low are bad enough with all the premade shits who suck ass and bring loses to their teams and keep thinking it is never their fault, always someone else's. As long as you know you are stuck there and want help to get better and get out, go play normals, ARAM and TT. Get used to different champions in different modes and different setups, this will give you more insight on how each champion works and will greatly help you play, plus you might find someone you can play well that you didn't really know.\n\nI had an AFK in a game yesterday, still carried them to a win because I know how to read the map and when to do what I need to do, so it can be done under the right circumstances. I have also been to Gold rank before, and part of the reason I am telling you to stop ranked, is that I got to gold solo in previous season before they implemented this god awful dynamic queue, that will be the main reason you cannot get out and there aint nothing you can do unless you play more normals and simply get better at the game.","replies":[]}]}
